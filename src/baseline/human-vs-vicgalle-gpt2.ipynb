A local man, Jim Hall, had been working as a prop gun handler at the time and noticed that the employee was not well-rested and had a weapon in hand.\\n\\nThe incident occurred shortly after Halloween when Hall was working with the prop gun handler at the Santa Fe ranch. During the filming of the movie in the film, the prop gun accidentally discharged after Hall had accidentally fired a deadly shot.\\n\\nThe department had investigated the incident and had issued a subpoena to investigate the situation. Hall was asked to turn over records related to his work with the California Department of Public Safety (CPS).\\n\\nHall and his friends were working on a project involving a prop gun and a crew of stunt performers at the Ranch during the filming of the film. They were told that if they didn't return to the ranch that the prop gun would be fired, and that they'd have to perform extra stunts.\\n\\nHall's friends were skeptical at first, but eventually agreed to help them perform extra stunts at the Ranch. The prop gun proved to be a safer and safer option than the shots the police had fired earlier.\\n\\nThe case has been referred to the California Department of Public Safety (CPS), which issued a subpoena to Hall. The department had no reason to stop investigating the prop gun situation until the investigation was completed.\\n\\nIt is important to note that the use of guns can be dangerous and that they are not always the best solution to an employee's mental health or safety. By handling a firearm responsibly, employees should be trained on handling firearms safely, and they should have the training to handle weapons with appropriate safety precautions.\\n\\nAdditionally, all employees are responsible for reporting incidents involving firearms to their supervisor or supervisors.\\n\\nIf you have any questions or concerns about this incident or the prop gun situation, you may want to reach out to your local law enforcement agency or the Department of Public Safety.\\n\\nBackground Information:\",\n          \"The Interior Department Investigates Capitol Riots: A Comprehensive Analysis.\\n\\nIn summary, the Interior Department is investigating the Jan. 6 Capitol riot and the possible involvement of law enforcement.

The article reveals that Rittenhouse, a former president who has been accused of murdering two people and injuring another during a controversial protest in Kenosha, Wisconsin, and was acquitted of charges.\\n\\nWhile the article does delve into the possibility that Rittenhouse might have had a 'two-week, all-expenses-paid vacation' at Mar-a-Lago, it doesn't delve into any additional information about his whereabouts during his visit.\\n\\nInstead, it discusses the allegations made against Rittenhouse and his mother at the time of the protest. While it's possible that Rittenhouse may have known about his visit to Mar-a-Lago, it's also possible that he received a message from his attorney that he was considering legal action, which could have affected his relationship with Trump.\\n\\nOverall, the article does not delve into any further details about Rittenhouse's whereabouts during his visit to Mar-a-Lago, but rather focuses on the claims made by his attorney that he was considering legal action for his client's claims against him and his family.\\n\\nThe piece concludes by highlighting the potential for legal action against Trump and claims made by a lawyer for Rittenhouse. While it's possible that Rittenhouse could face legal action, it's also possible that he would face legal action if he were found to have engaged in illegal activities at the club or if he were found to have acted in a cover-up.\\n\\nBased on the information presented in the article, it's likely that Rittenhouse may have had contact with his attorney and was considering legal action to get back at him.\\n\\nIn summary, the article does not delve into any further details about Rittenhouse's whereabouts during his visit to Mar-a-Lago, but rather focuses on the claims made by his attorney that he was considering legal action for his client's claims against him and their relationship with Trump.\\n\\nThe article discusses Rittenhouse's claims regarding his vacation at Mar-a-\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

A local man, Jim Hall, had been working as a prop gun handler at the time and noticed that the employee was not well-rested and had a weapon in hand.\\n\\nThe incident occurred shortly after Halloween when Hall was working with the prop gun handler at the Santa Fe ranch. During the filming of the movie in the film, the prop gun accidentally discharged after Hall had accidentally fired a deadly shot.\\n\\nThe department had investigated the incident and had issued a subpoena to investigate the situation. Hall was asked to turn over records related to his work with the California Department of Public Safety (CPS).\\n\\nHall and his friends were working on a project involving a prop gun and a crew of stunt performers at the Ranch during the filming of the film. They were told that if they didn't return to the ranch that the prop gun would be fired, and that they'd have to perform extra stunts.\\n\\nHall's friends were skeptical at first, but eventually agreed to help them perform extra stunts at the Ranch. The prop gun proved to be a safer and safer option than the shots the police had fired earlier.\\n\\nThe case has been referred to the California Department of Public Safety (CPS), which issued a subpoena to Hall. The department had no reason to stop investigating the prop gun situation until the investigation was completed.\\n\\nIt is important to note that the use of guns can be dangerous and that they are not always the best solution to an employee's mental health or safety. By handling a firearm responsibly, employees should be trained on handling firearms safely, and they should have the training to handle weapons with appropriate safety precautions.\\n\\nAdditionally, all employees are responsible for reporting incidents involving firearms to their supervisor or supervisors.\\n\\nIf you have any questions or concerns about this incident or the prop gun situation, you may want to reach out to your local law enforcement agency or the Department of Public Safety.\\n\\nBackground Information:\",\n          \"The Interior Department Investigates Capitol Riots: A Comprehensive Analysis.\\n\\nIn summary, the Interior Department is investigating the Jan. 6 Capitol riot and the possible involvement of law enforcement.

The article reveals that Rittenhouse, a former president who has been accused of murdering two people and injuring another during a controversial protest in Kenosha, Wisconsin, and was acquitted of charges.\\n\\nWhile the article does delve into the possibility that Rittenhouse might have had a 'two-week, all-expenses-paid vacation' at Mar-a-Lago, it doesn't delve into any additional information about his whereabouts during his visit.\\n\\nInstead, it discusses the allegations made against Rittenhouse and his mother at the time of the protest. While it's possible that Rittenhouse may have known about his visit to Mar-a-Lago, it's also possible that he received a message from his attorney that he was considering legal action, which could have affected his relationship with Trump.\\n\\nOverall, the article does not delve into any further details about Rittenhouse's whereabouts during his visit to Mar-a-Lago, but rather focuses on the claims made by his attorney that he was considering legal action for his client's claims against him and his family.\\n\\nThe piece concludes by highlighting the potential for legal action against Trump and claims made by a lawyer for Rittenhouse. While it's possible that Rittenhouse could face legal action, it's also possible that he would face legal action if he were found to have engaged in illegal activities at the club or if he were found to have acted in a cover-up.\\n\\nBased on the information presented in the article, it's likely that Rittenhouse may have had contact with his attorney and was considering legal action to get back at him.\\n\\nIn summary, the article does not delve into any further details about Rittenhouse's whereabouts during his visit to Mar-a-Lago, but rather focuses on the claims made by his attorney that he was considering legal action for his client's claims against him and their relationship with Trump.\\n\\nThe article discusses Rittenhouse's claims regarding his vacation at Mar-a-\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"is_llm\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The candidate showed 100% protection against moderate and severe disease. In people at high risk of developing complications from COVID-19 (people 65 years or older and people under age 65 with certain comorbidities or with likely regular exposure to COVID-19), the vaccine showed 91.0% efficacy in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 disease.\\n\\nSafety data indicate the investigational vaccine was generally well-tolerated. Mild-to-moderate injection site pain and tenderness were the most common local symptoms among participants, and fatigue, headache and muscle pain lasting less than two days were the most common systemic symptoms.\\n\\nNovavax, Inc., of Gaithersburg, Maryland, developed the investigational vaccine and led the clinical trial known as PREVENT-19. The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), a component of the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health, provided funding support for the trial as part of the federal COVID-19 response.\\n\\nThe PREVENT-19 trial began in late December 2020 and enrolled adult volunteers at 119 study sites, including those in the NIAID-supported COVID-19 Prevention Network (CoVPN). Participants were randomly assigned to receive two shots, 21 days apart, of either the investigational vaccine or a saline placebo. Randomization occurred in a 2:1 ratio with two volunteers receiving NVX-CoV2373 for each one who received placebo. Because the trial was blinded, neither investigators nor participants knew who received the candidate vaccine.\\n\\nPREVENT-19 was designed to evaluate whether NVX-CoV2373 can prevent symptomatic COVID-19 disease seven or more days after the second injection relative to placebo. The results shared today are based on 77 cases of symptomatic COVID-19 that investigators observed among trial participants from January 25 through April 30, 2021. Investigators recorded 63 cases among the approximately 10,000 participants who received placebo and 14 cases among the approximately 20,000 participants who received the investigational vaccine. Of the 63 COVID-19 cases in the placebo group, investigators classified 10 as moderate and four as severe. There were no cases of moderate or severe disease in the investigational vaccine group.\",\n          \"Derek Chauvin's Trial Begins in Court - New York Supreme Court Proposes Racial Split\\n\\nThe Sentence \\\"The defense team in Derek Chauvin's trial has diverse array of lawyers, with two assistant attorneys general, Matthew Frank and Erin Eldridge, and two outside lawyers, Jerry Blackwell and Steve Schleicher, leading in court.

The latest round includes 1 million payments, with the IRS noting they have an official payment date of May 12. That means the most recent recipients will receive a direct deposit on Wednesday, or soon get a paper check or pre-paid debit card in the mail.\\n\\nThe timing and delivery of checks has been a cause of anxiety for some people, especially for those who receive government benefits such as Social Security and don't typically file taxes. The IRS prioritized sending checks to people who have already filed their 2019 or 2020 tax returns, since the agency was able to quickly verify eligibility based on income and also determine where to mail or direct deposit the checks.\\n\\nFollowing that initial distribution of checks, the IRS vetted payment data for government benefit recipients, with recipients of Social Security benefits among those still receiving their checks. On Wednesday, the IRS said the payments arriving this week include more than 460,000 \\\"plus-up\\\" payments for people who were owed more stimulus funds than they initially received.\\n\\nThe agency said it's sending another 500,000 payments to eligible people who recently filed a tax return but for whom it didn't previously have information to issue a stimulus check.\\n\\nAbout half of the newly issued checks were sent via direct deposit, with the other half sent through the mail via paper checks or pre-paid debit cards, the IRS said.\\n\\nFourth stimulus check?\\n\\nSome lawmakers are pushing for a fourth round of payments even as the IRS continues to distribute the third stimulus checks. One year after the pandemic shut down the U.S. economy, millions of people continue to experience financial hardship. About 38% of people said their household income remains impacted by the crisis, according to a study from TransUnion, a financial services firm.\\n\\nThat represents a significant decline from a year earlier, when about 6 in 10 people said their household income had taken a hit, but it continues to show the ongoing struggles facing many Americans, said Charlie Wise, head of global research and consulting at TransUnion.\\n\\n\\\"It's material improvement, but it indicates over one-third of consumers are continuing to feel some sort of financial impact,\\\" Wise told CBS MoneyWatch. \\\"That's a big deal.\\\"\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"is_llm\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The candidate showed 100% protection against moderate and severe disease. In people at high risk of developing complications from COVID-19 (people 65 years or older and people under age 65 with certain comorbidities or with likely regular exposure to COVID-19), the vaccine showed 91.0% efficacy in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 disease.\\n\\nSafety data indicate the investigational vaccine was generally well-tolerated. Mild-to-moderate injection site pain and tenderness were the most common local symptoms among participants, and fatigue, headache and muscle pain lasting less than two days were the most common systemic symptoms.\\n\\nNovavax, Inc., of Gaithersburg, Maryland, developed the investigational vaccine and led the clinical trial known as PREVENT-19. The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), a component of the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health, provided funding support for the trial as part of the federal COVID-19 response.\\n\\nThe PREVENT-19 trial began in late December 2020 and enrolled adult volunteers at 119 study sites, including those in the NIAID-supported COVID-19 Prevention Network (CoVPN). Participants were randomly assigned to receive two shots, 21 days apart, of either the investigational vaccine or a saline placebo. Randomization occurred in a 2:1 ratio with two volunteers receiving NVX-CoV2373 for each one who received placebo. Because the trial was blinded, neither investigators nor participants knew who received the candidate vaccine.\\n\\nPREVENT-19 was designed to evaluate whether NVX-CoV2373 can prevent symptomatic COVID-19 disease seven or more days after the second injection relative to placebo. The results shared today are based on 77 cases of symptomatic COVID-19 that investigators observed among trial participants from January 25 through April 30, 2021. Investigators recorded 63 cases among the approximately 10,000 participants who received placebo and 14 cases among the approximately 20,000 participants who received the investigational vaccine. Of the 63 COVID-19 cases in the placebo group, investigators classified 10 as moderate and four as severe. There were no cases of moderate or severe disease in the investigational vaccine group.\",\n          \"Derek Chauvin's Trial Begins in Court - New York Supreme Court Proposes Racial Split\\n\\nThe Sentence \\\"The defense team in Derek Chauvin's trial has diverse array of lawyers, with two assistant attorneys general, Matthew Frank and Erin Eldridge, and two outside lawyers, Jerry Blackwell and Steve Schleicher, leading in court.

Here's how to track yours.\\n\\nWhile major banks in the U.S. started delivering $1,400 stimulus checks in March, the federal relief payments continue to arrive at millions of households struggling to make ends meet amid the coronavirus-hobbled economy.\\n\\nThe Internal Revenue Service has delivered more than 165 million payments, with a total value of approximately $388 billion, the agency said Wednesday. The latest round includes 1 million payments, with the IRS noting they have an official payment date of May 12. That means the most recent recipients will receive a direct deposit on Wednesday, or soon get a paper check or pre-paid debit card in the mail.\\n\\nThe timing and delivery of checks has been a cause of anxiety for some people, especially for those who receive government benefits such as Social Security and don't typically file taxes. The IRS prioritized sending checks to people who have already filed their 2019 or 2020 tax returns, since the agency was able to quickly verify eligibility based on income and also determine where to mail or direct deposit the checks.\\n\\nFollowing that initial distribution of checks, the IRS vetted payment data for government benefit recipients, with recipients of Social Security benefits among those still receiving their checks. On Wednesday, the IRS said the payments arriving this week include more than 460,000 \\\"plus-up\\\" payments for people who were owed more stimulus funds than they initially received.\\n\\nThe agency said it's sending another 500,000 payments to eligible people who recently filed a tax return but for whom it didn't previously have information to issue a stimulus check.\\n\\nAbout half of the newly issued checks were sent via direct deposit, with the other half sent through the mail via paper checks or pre-paid debit cards, the IRS said.\\n\\nFourth stimulus check?\\n\\nSome lawmakers are pushing for a fourth round of payments even as the IRS continues to distribute the third stimulus checks. One year after the pandemic shut down the U.S. economy, millions of people continue to experience financial hardship. About 38% of people said their household income remains impacted by the crisis, according to a study from TransUnion, a financial services firm.\\n\\nThat represents a significant decline from a year earlier, when about 6 in 10 people said their household income had taken a hit, but it continues to show the ongoing struggles facing many Americans, said Charlie Wise, head of global research and consulting at TransUnion.\\n\\n\\\"It's material improvement, but it indicates over one-third of consumers are continuing to feel some sort of financial impact,\\\" Wise told CBS MoneyWatch. \\\"That's a big deal.\\\"\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"is_llm\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"tokenized_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
