The Tribune Content Agency is a digital content production company of The Tribune Company. The agency was created to help fund, scale and promote digital growth across The Tribune Company brands. The agency was created to provide funding, scale and promotion support for Tribune\\u2019s digital businesses, including The Tribune newspaper network, several digital products, as well as industry-leading websites, newsletters and social platforms. The agency includes The Tribune\\u2019s North American digital production operations, and serves as an internal funding mechanism that will allow Tribune to grow and scale its digital business. The agency will be led by chief executive officer Peter Lu, who was most recently the chief strategy officer of Tribune, and chief revenue officer Niel Fox, who most recently served as vice president of revenue at Tribune. The agency is structured as a membership organization, and will include several equity investors, including Access Industries, and Launchpad, a fund of Madison River Management. The Tribune Company, which owns several major American newspaper companies and websites such as the Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune and KTLA, has been experiencing declining readership and revenue in recent years. As a result, the company has been exploring several options for its digital operations, which include launching a digital comics platform, creating a joint venture with Amazon to create original series, and exploring a sale. On November 1, 2020, the company agreed to be purchased by Japan-based Nikkei Inc. for $5.6 billion, including $1.1 billion in deferred commercial commitments. The agreement, which was approved by the US Federal Communications Commission and the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, will see Nikkei take over the ownership of Wrapports, which owns the Tribune and Chicago News org websites, as well as a number of web and social video production businesses. The deal saw FCC approval in November 2020, and was originally set to be finalized in 2022, but concerns over the pandemic pushed the deadline to November 2021. The completion of the purchase is subject to certain conditions, including approval by the Competition Office and the Department of Justice. Nikkei also agreed to sell off several assets in large deals with several of its other subsidiaries, including digital operations of its real-estate business, as well as its 43% stake in WNET, a public television station in New York. The company has hired Goldman Sachs to explore potential alternatives for its digital operations, which could include a sale. The company has also explored a sale of its newspaper assets, which it planned to fund through corporate division divestitures, along with other alternatives, such as a strategic partnership or new joint ventures. The full buyout by Nikkei was completed on November 1, 2021. As of 2021, the digital business of Tribune Company, which included Tribune and Wrapports, had annualized revenue of $320 million, and operated losses of $75 million. As part of the acquisition, Nikkei will inject $125 million into the digital business over the next two years. It will also invest an additional $150 million over the next three years, and grant Tribune a long-term license to use Nikkei\\u2019s robotics technology. Nikkei has also offered to sell off digital assets to help further subsidize the digital operations of Tribune, such as its ownership of WNET. Nikkei has also agreed to provide up to $150 million in additional working capital support, along with access to its technology and data analytics. In return, Tribune will be obligated to deploy $150 million of its $250 million share of net cash from the deferred commercial commitments in five years, as well as grant Nikkei a $100 million-accelerated earnout. Together, the combination of Nikkei and Tribune will be one of the largest digital content production companies in the media industry, producing around $500 million in revenue by 2023. It is currently working on a deal to acquire ACX, a large global producer of digital audiobooks. The creation of the Tribune Content Agency was first announced on October 23, 2019, as part of a strategic overhaul of Tribune\\u2019s digital operations. At the time, a source familiar with the matter told Vulture that the agency was in the process of being incorporated, though it was not clear at the time that it would include funding from Nikkei. The new entity will be led by Lu, and will consist of the following teams: \\u2014 Los Angeles Times: An East Coast newsroom responsible for breaking news and in-depth coverage of Los Angeles, California, and its surrounding areas. \\u2014 Chicago Tribune:\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"is_llm\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"date\",\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"domain\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"reddit\",\n          \"wikihow\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"dataset_name\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 25,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"reddit_dolly\",\n          \"wikipedia_davinci\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

The Tribune Content Agency is a digital content production company of The Tribune Company. The agency was created to help fund, scale and promote digital growth across The Tribune Company brands. The agency was created to provide funding, scale and promotion support for Tribune\\u2019s digital businesses, including The Tribune newspaper network, several digital products, as well as industry-leading websites, newsletters and social platforms. The agency includes The Tribune\\u2019s North American digital production operations, and serves as an internal funding mechanism that will allow Tribune to grow and scale its digital business. The agency will be led by chief executive officer Peter Lu, who was most recently the chief strategy officer of Tribune, and chief revenue officer Niel Fox, who most recently served as vice president of revenue at Tribune. The agency is structured as a membership organization, and will include several equity investors, including Access Industries, and Launchpad, a fund of Madison River Management. The Tribune Company, which owns several major American newspaper companies and websites such as the Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune and KTLA, has been experiencing declining readership and revenue in recent years. As a result, the company has been exploring several options for its digital operations, which include launching a digital comics platform, creating a joint venture with Amazon to create original series, and exploring a sale. On November 1, 2020, the company agreed to be purchased by Japan-based Nikkei Inc. for $5.6 billion, including $1.1 billion in deferred commercial commitments. The agreement, which was approved by the US Federal Communications Commission and the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, will see Nikkei take over the ownership of Wrapports, which owns the Tribune and Chicago News org websites, as well as a number of web and social video production businesses. The deal saw FCC approval in November 2020, and was originally set to be finalized in 2022, but concerns over the pandemic pushed the deadline to November 2021. The completion of the purchase is subject to certain conditions, including approval by the Competition Office and the Department of Justice. Nikkei also agreed to sell off several assets in large deals with several of its other subsidiaries, including digital operations of its real-estate business, as well as its 43% stake in WNET, a public television station in New York. The company has hired Goldman Sachs to explore potential alternatives for its digital operations, which could include a sale. The company has also explored a sale of its newspaper assets, which it planned to fund through corporate division divestitures, along with other alternatives, such as a strategic partnership or new joint ventures. The full buyout by Nikkei was completed on November 1, 2021. As of 2021, the digital business of Tribune Company, which included Tribune and Wrapports, had annualized revenue of $320 million, and operated losses of $75 million. As part of the acquisition, Nikkei will inject $125 million into the digital business over the next two years. It will also invest an additional $150 million over the next three years, and grant Tribune a long-term license to use Nikkei\\u2019s robotics technology. Nikkei has also offered to sell off digital assets to help further subsidize the digital operations of Tribune, such as its ownership of WNET. Nikkei has also agreed to provide up to $150 million in additional working capital support, along with access to its technology and data analytics. In return, Tribune will be obligated to deploy $150 million of its $250 million share of net cash from the deferred commercial commitments in five years, as well as grant Nikkei a $100 million-accelerated earnout. Together, the combination of Nikkei and Tribune will be one of the largest digital content production companies in the media industry, producing around $500 million in revenue by 2023. It is currently working on a deal to acquire ACX, a large global producer of digital audiobooks. The creation of the Tribune Content Agency was first announced on October 23, 2019, as part of a strategic overhaul of Tribune\\u2019s digital operations. At the time, a source familiar with the matter told Vulture that the agency was in the process of being incorporated, though it was not clear at the time that it would include funding from Nikkei. The new entity will be led by Lu, and will consist of the following teams: \\u2014 Los Angeles Times: An East Coast newsroom responsible for breaking news and in-depth coverage of Los Angeles, California, and its surrounding areas. \\u2014 Chicago Tribune:\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"is_llm\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"domain\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"reddit\",\n          \"wikihow\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"dataset_name\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 25,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"reddit_dolly\",\n          \"wikipedia_davinci\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",
