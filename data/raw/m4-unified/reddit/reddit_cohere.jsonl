{"text":"\n\nThe English king Henry II was famously involved in a 1559 jousting accident in which he accidentally killed his opponent. The opponent was the son of the French constable, Gabriel de Montgomery. The death of Henry's opponent, Gabriel de Montgomery, resulted in a four-year war between France and England. The war was a part of the Italian Wars, which included a series of wars between various European powers from 1494 to 1559. The war between France and England ended in 1563 with the Treaty of Troyes. Henry II later died in 1589."}
{"text":"\n\nThe Louisiana Purchase was a major land deal between the United States and France, concluded in 1803. The United States bought Louisiana from France, doubling the size of the young nation. The Louisiana Purchase was a watershed moment in American history, marking the country's emergence as a major player on the world stage.\n\nThe purchase was made possible by the work of Thomas Jefferson and James Monroe. They had long been seeking to acquire Louisiana from France. In 1803, they were able to negotiate a deal with the French. The purchase price was $15 million, which was a significant sum of money at the time.\n\nThe money transfer for the Louisiana Purchase was not as simple as loading a bunch of money in ships and sending it to France. In practice, the United States paid France in the form of bonds, which were then used to pay off debts that France owed to the United States. This arrangement was mutually beneficial for both countries. The United States was able to acquire a valuable piece of land, and France was able to pay off its debts. The Louisiana Purchase was a major turning point in American history, and it was made possible by a complex money transfer."}

In modern times, however, the practice of removing pubic hair is more common among women than men. There are a number of reasons why people might choose to remove their pubic hair, including personal preference, hygiene, and fashion. However, it is important to note that removing pubic hair is not necessary for good hygiene and that it is a personal choice."}
{"text":"\nWatergate is the name of the scandal surrounding President Richard Nixon, who was the 37th President of the United States. He was in office from 1969 to 1974, but was forced to resign in August of 1974 because of Watergate. \n\nWatergate has entered the political lexicon as a term synonymous with political scandal. The Watergate Hotel in Washington D.C. has become infamous as a result of the Watergate scandal. The scandal began with the Watergate Hotel burglary on June 17, 1972, when several men were arrested for breaking into the Democratic Party's national offices. This was followed by Nixon's administration attempting to cover up its involvement in the burglary. The scandal eventually led to the discovery of abuses of power by the Nixon administration, particularly in the realm of political spying and Nixon's attempts to impede the investigation into Watergate. \n\nThe Watergate scandal led to Nixon's resignation on August 9, 1974. Nixon was the first American president to resign from office. The Watergate scandal also led to the indictment, trial, conviction, and imprisonment of dozens of Nixon administration officials. The scandal continues to be relevant today, as the modern political era is still grappling with the ramifications of Watergate."}
{"text":"\nIf a king fell in battle, it was considered a great dishonor to the king for any common soldier to be the one to strike the fatal blow. However, if the king was clearly in a position where he was about to be captured, some of his men would fall on their swords to prevent that from happening. That said, there were no real rules of engagement when it came to kings in battle. The important thing was to strike a decisive blow against the enemy. If that meant killing the king, then so be it."}
{"text":"\n\nThe Gatling gun is one of the most iconic weapons of the late 19th century. Designed by Dr. Richard Gatling in 1861, it was one of the first successful rapid-fire weapons. The gun was hand-cranked, with each crank of the handle loading a bullet into the chamber and cocking the weapon. This allowed for a very high rate of fire, with some models capable of firing up to 350 rounds per minute. This made the Gatling gun a very effective weapon against large groups of enemy soldiers. However, it was also very heavy and bulky, making it difficult to transport and manoeuvre. This, along with the fact that it was very expensive to produce, meant that it was not widely adopted by military forces. Despite its limitations, the Gatling gun was a significant development in weapon technology and played a role in the development of later machine guns. It is still used today by some military and law enforcement agencies."}
{"text":"\n\nDunkirk was a major defeat for the British. However, it could have been a far worse disaster. When the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) retreated to Dunkirk, it was surrounded on three sides. The BEF was saved by the heroic efforts of the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force, which evacuated over 300,000 British soldiers. The defeat at Dunkirk led to the resignation of Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain and his replacement by Winston Churchill.\n\nChurchill made a speech to the House of Commons a few days after Dunkirk, in which he said:\n\n\"We shall go on to the end, we shall fight in France, we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our Island, whatever the cost may be, we shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender.\"\n\nChurchill's words, which became known as the \"We shall fight on the beaches\" speech, inspired the people of Britain. It showed that even though the BEF had been forced to retreat, Britain would continue to fight. Dunkirk was a defeat, but it was not the end."}
{"text":"\n\nThere are several reasons why castration was sometimes used as a form of punishment. In some cases, it was used as a punishment for crimes against the state, such as treason. It was also used as a form of punishment for men who were deemed to be too weak to fight in battle. Castration was also used as a way to control the population. In ancient times, castration was used as a way to prevent men from having children. This was done in order to maintain a certain level of population control."}

It was a war that was fought on multiple fronts, with many different groups of people fighting for their own reasons. While the war was mainly between Russia and Germany, it also involved the United States, Great Britain, France, and many other countries. The war between Japan and China was a major part of the war, but it was not the only part. There were many other conflicts that took place during the war, and they all had their own unique aspects.

However, he did not invent the airplane, nor was he the first to fly one. \n\nThe Wright brothers, Orville and Wilbur, are widely recognized as the inventors of the airplane. They were the first to achieve powered, sustained flight in a controlled aircraft, and they hold the record for the longest controlled, powered flight in history. \n\nWhile Santos-Dumont made significant contributions to the development of aviation, he did not achieve powered flight in a controlled aircraft. Instead, he focused on developing balloons and airships, and he was the first to successfully pilot a powered, fixed-wing aircraft."}
{"text":"\n\nLovecraft said that the \"vivid picture of an uncanny creature half man and half dragon\" came to him in a dream, and that he had \"modelled the idol's head on a portrait of Boticelli's 'Laocoon'.\" But he also said that the \"prodigious bulk\" of the monster was suggested by \"a drawing of the Great God Pan by the English caricaturist, John Tenniel.\"\n\nAccording to S. T. Joshi, in his introduction to The Call of Cthulhu and Other Weird Stories (Penguin Classics), Lovecraft's \"mythmaking was not so much a process of inventing new material as of rearranging old material, and this was particularly true of the entities that would come to be known as the Great Old Ones.\"\n\nLovecraft's monsters \"were composites of various elements derived from myth and legend, history and literature, and it was the unique arrangement of these elements, along with the original and singularly compelling vision of the stories in which they figured, that gave them their particular and enduring power.\"\n\nLovecraft's imaginary pantheon was \"derived in large part from the works of Arthur Machen and Algernon Blackwood,\" says Joshi. Machen's \"great Welsh Gothic novel, The Great God Pan (1894), along with the works of Lord Dunsany, was the direct inspiration for Lovecraft's dreamlands.\""}

{"text":"\nThe only sports that were part of the original Olympic Games were foot races, long jump, shot put, javelin, boxing and wrestling. The winners of these events were highly celebrated, and often immortalized in statues and poems. The ancient Olympic Games were held every four years between August 6th and September 19th during a religious festival honoring Zeus. Only freeborn male citizens of Greece were allowed to participate and they had to have been in training for at least ten months. Women were not allowed to watch the Olympic Games and men with criminal records were banned. The games were eventually banned in 393 AD by Emperor Theodosius I as part of a general ban on all \"pagan\" festivals. The modern Olympic Games began in Athens in 1896 and have been held every four years since, with the exception of 1916, during World War I, and in 1940 and 1944, during World War II."}
{"text":"\n\nDuring the Holocaust, the SS were not regular soldiers. They were the henchmen of the Third Reich, and they were specifically chosen for their cruelty, sadism, and obedience. These qualities are not generally associated with ordinary soldiers, who are trained to fight and kill, but not to enjoy it. The SS were different. They were trained to enjoy their work.\n\nIt is therefore not surprising that there is no evidence of even a single SS soldier who objected to the mass murder of Jews. The Holocaust was not a case of \"a few bad apples\" gone rogue; it was a carefully planned and executed genocide, in which the SS played a crucial role. The SS were not regular soldiers; they were sadistic, cruel, and obedient. They were chosen for their qualities, which are not generally associated with ordinary soldiers."}

{"text":"\n\nKen Burns states that the average soldier in the Civil War was 5'8 and 140 pounds. This seems exceptionally small and light for a population selected to fight. European armies of the same time period would not have been this small. One possible explanation for this is that the average soldier in the Civil War was younger than the average soldier in European armies. In European armies, men were often conscripted at the age of 20, while in the Civil War, the average age of a soldier was 19. This would account for the smaller stature of the average soldier in the Civil War."}

He was a general during the Revolutionary War, and he helped the colonies defeat the British. But was he a good general? That's a bit more subjective.\n\nSome historians argue that Washington was a poor general, pointing to his record of losing battles and failing to capture enemy strongholds. Others argue that he was a great general, noting his ability to keep the Continental Army together and maintain morale despite difficult circumstances. Ultimately, it's impossible to say for sure whether Washington was a good general. But one thing is certain: he was a great leader."}

{"text":"\nChildren were kidnapped during the reign of Louis XV, and rumours were whispered of the King's 'purple baths'. Hugo is referring to the Affair of the Diamond Necklace, a scandal that rocked the French court in 1785. The story goes that Louis' mistress, Jeanne de Valois, was heavily in debt. She and her lover, Cardinal de Rohan, planned to defraud the jewellers Boehmer and Bassenge by having Jeanne's maid, Marie Antoinette de Lamballe, borrow an expensive diamond necklace, which she would then 'discover' and return. However, Jeanne and the Cardinal were caught out when Jeanne was unable to return the necklace, which led to an embarrassing public scandal. Although there is little evidence to support the theory that the King was directly involved in the scheme, the public were quick to assume that he was, and the rumours of his 'purple baths' likely referred to the colour purple being the symbol of adultery."}

{"text":"\nFrance had been invaded by Germany twice in the first half of the 20th century and had a long history of political instability. Under the French Third Republic, the country had undergone a series of crises and, in the decade prior to World War II, had seen a dozen different governments. The war had left France in a state of political chaos. In the immediate aftermath of the war, France was occupied by Germany. The new French Republic was established in October 1946, following the resignation of the provisional government of the French Republic (GPRF) and the dissolution of the National Assembly. The constitution of the French Republic was approved by referendum in September 1947, and general elections were held in June and July. In August, the French Communist Party (PCF) was banned.\n\nDe Gaulle was determined to prevent a return to the political chaos of the Third Republic. He proposed a new constitution, which would give the president almost unlimited powers. This constitution was approved in September 1958.

Some of the proceeds from the sale were then funneled to support the Contra rebel groups in Nicaragua, which were attempting to overthrow the Sandinista government.\n\nThe scandal came to light in November 1986. The revelation of the scandal resulted in a major crisis of confidence in the Reagan administration. Several administration officials were indicted and convicted. However, no one was impeached. In the view of many observers, the most serious consequence was the end of the Reagan administration's hopes for the continued funding of the Contras."}

Tattooing had become popular in the late nineteenth century among seamen and soldiers, and in the 1920s, was adopted by the petty bourgeoisie, including housewives. The tattooed person was considered a social outcast, a threat to the health of the German race. The police were ordered to forcibly remove all tattoos. Tattoos on the face, neck, and hands were removed by burning with a hot iron. The treatment caused severe bleeding and lifelong scars. Many people with tattoos tried to hide them by covering them with make-up or wearing extra clothing.\"\n\nDuring the Holocaust, the Nazis tattooed numbers on the arms of concentration camp prisoners. This made it easier to identify them and control the population of the camps. Prisoners were also tattooed with identification numbers when they were used for medical experiments. These tattoos helped doctors keep track of the results of their experiments."}

It used to be a place where different cultures and religions coexisted in relative peace. But that all changed in the 11th century when the Seljuk Turks invaded the region. The Seljuks were a group of nomadic warriors who had a very different culture and way of life than the people who already lived there.

The documents are thought to have been composed by the Essenes, a Jewish sect active in the Second Temple period. The texts are mostly biblical, but they also include hymns and other documents that provide insights into the beliefs and practices of the Essenes. The Dead Sea Scrolls are significant because they provide evidence for the accuracy of the modern Bible, as well as information about the history and culture of the Second Temple period. For example, the scrolls include the earliest known manuscripts of the Hebrew Bible, and they also contain evidence for the use of biblical Hebrew as a spoken language in the Second Temple period. The scrolls also provide a wealth of information about the Essenes, including their beliefs, practices, and history. The Dead Sea Scrolls are an invaluable resource for understanding the Second Temple period and the development of early Judaism."}

However, these options were not always available to everyone. In the case of a peasant, it would have been very difficult to rise in society. The peasant class was the lowest in society, and peasants were expected to remain peasants for their entire lives. Peasants were often required to work on their lord's land for free, and they were not allowed to leave the land.\n\nIn addition to the difficulty of rising in society, there were also many risks associated with trying to improve one's situation. For example, if a peasant left the land he was working on, he could be accused of being a runaway and punished. In the 13th century, it was rare for a peasant to be able to improve his lot in life. The majority of peasants remained peasants their entire lives, and only a very small number were able to rise in society."}
{"text":"\nWhen bread is made, the flour is mixed with water and yeast. Yeast is a living organism that feeds on sugar and starches in the flour. The yeast releases carbon dioxide as it feeds. This causes the dough to rise and gives bread its light and airy texture. The dough is then baked in an oven, which kills the yeast and sets the bread's structure. The type of flour, the amount of water, and the length of time the dough is allowed to rise all affect the final product.\n\nIn general, bread from different eras would have been made with different types of flour and risen for different lengths of time. This would have resulted in bread that was unique to each era. For example, bread made in Egypt in 2200 BC would have been made with wheat flour that was ground using stones. It would have risen for a longer period of time, giving it a more dense and chewy texture. In contrast, bread made in Rome in 45 BC would have been made with wheat flour that was ground using metal rollers. It would have risen for a shorter period of time, giving it a lighter and airier texture.\n\nBread made in England in 1100 AD would have been made with wheat flour that was ground using a water mill. It would have risen for a longer period of time, giving it a more dense and chewy texture. However, it is worth noting that bread making techniques have changed significantly over the centuries.

It was the capital of the Umayyad caliphate, and home to the great Mosque of Cordoba, the Mezquita, which still exists. \nThe Mezquita was considered a wonder of the world.

It was a tolerant, multiethnic society, with people of different faiths and cultures living together in relative peace.\nThe world was also a dangerous place, full of conflict and uncertainty. The Christian kingdoms of the north were always threatening to invade the Muslim south. The Christian king Alfonso VI of Castile had just captured the Muslim city of Zaragoza, which was considered impregnable.

The Almoravids, a Berber dynasty from the western Sahara, had just conquered Morocco and were threatening to invade Al-Andalus. The Fatimid Caliphate, a Shi'ite dynasty based in Egypt, was also a threat.\nThe most pressing issue of the day was the Almoravid threat. The Almoravids were strict Sunni Muslims who wanted to purify Islam by destroying all vestiges of Shi'ism. They were also committed to spreading Islam by conquering non-Muslim lands. The people of Al-Andalus were divided on how to respond. Some wanted to fight, while others wanted to make peace.\nIn the end, the Almoravids did not invade Al-Andalus. The people of Cordoba breathed a sigh of relief. But the threat of invasion was always present, and the world of 1111 was a precarious place, full of danger and uncertainty."}

{"text":"\nDuring the Viking age, the Scandinavians became well known for their seafaring skills. The boats they used to navigate the seas were called longships. Longships were made of wood, with a shallow hull and a single mast. The mast was fixed, which meant that the sails could not be reefed (adjusted) to suit changing wind conditions. Longships were also open to the elements, which meant that the Vikings were exposed to the wind, rain, and snow while they were sailing. Despite these challenges, the Vikings were able to navigate the seas successfully. One of the reasons they were able to do this was because they were skilled sailors. They were able to read the weather and the sea, and they knew how to use the sails and the mast to their advantage. They were also able to make use of the currents and the winds, and they were able to navigate using the stars and the sun. In addition to their sailing skills, the Vikings also had a number of other advantages that helped them to survive while they were sailing. For example, they were able to catch fish and other seafood while they were at sea. They were also able to gather fresh water from the rain and the sea, and they were able to use the sun and the wind to dry their clothes. Furthermore, the Vikings were able to stay warm while they were sailing by wearing thick clothes and by using fur to cover their boats. Overall, the Vikings were able to navigate the seas successfully because they were skilled sailors and because they were able to make use of the resources that were available to them."}

In fact, during the 1860s, the population of California, Nevada, and Utah increased by an amazing 60 percent, from 93,000 to 150,000. Most African Americans who did make the journey were men, hoping to strike it rich by mining gold or silver, or working as cowboys. But they soon learned that racism was just as prevalent in the West as it was in the East. Many former slaves ended up working as low-paid laborers or as ranch hands, often under the supervision of white men.\n\nEven before the war, many African Americans had gone west to work as buffalo soldiers in the U.S. Army. The buffalo soldiers were African American men who had been slaves before the war. They were among the many men who joined the Army after the Emancipation Proclamation was signed in 1863. The buffalo soldiers served in the western states, including Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas. They fought in the Indian Wars and protected settlers from Native American attacks. The buffalo soldiers faced discrimination while in the Army. They were paid less than white soldiers, and they were often given the most dangerous assignments. Many buffalo soldiers died in battle.\n\nAfrican Americans who did make it out West often lived in segregated neighborhoods. The black population in western cities, such as Denver and Los Angeles, was relatively small. There were not enough African Americans in these areas to establish their own communities, as the Mormons had done. But they did have churches and other organizations where they could socialize and support one another."}

Therefore, they built the pyramids very strong and with very thick walls.\n\nThe ancient Egyptians did not have any construction machinery, so they did all the hard work with their own hands. They used people to move heavy stones. These people were divided into two groups. One group was responsible for moving stones from the quarries to the construction site, and the other group was responsible for transporting them to the construction site and placing them in the right place.\n\nThe pyramids were built in a very short time. It is believed that the Great Pyramid of Giza was built in 20 years. This is truly a remarkable achievement, given the methods of construction used by the ancient Egyptians. The largest pyramid is made up of about 2.5 million stones, each weighing about 2.5 tons. It is believed that the total weight of the pyramid is about 6 million tons. The length of each side of the base of the pyramid is 230 meters, and the height is 146 meters.\n\nThe Great Pyramid of Giza was considered the largest building in the world for thousands of years. The pyramid was not only the tomb of the pharaoh, but also a temple in which the soul of the pharaoh could ascend to heaven. Only the priests could enter this pyramid. They were engaged in the care of the soul of the departed.\n\nThe ancient Egyptians believed that the soul had to be preserved, and for this they invented the art of embalming, which allowed the body to be preserved for a long time. The priests embalmed the body of the pharaoh. The body was placed in a stone coffin, which was then placed in a special room in the pyramid.\n\nThe pyramid was not only a tomb, but also a temple. The priests performed various rituals in the temple, which were supposed to help the soul of the pharaoh to ascend to heaven. They believed that the pharaoh would become a god after death."}
{"text":"\n\nDuring the Reconstruction Era after the Civil War, many Southern states used prison labor, including convict leasing. In Georgia, this system was called the \"chain gang,\" and it continued into the 20th century. Prisoners were typically put to work on railroads, building roads, and digging sewers. But in Georgia, they also quarried granite.\n\nIn the early 1900s, the state began leasing convicts to the Georgia Granite Corporation, a company that had been established in 1878 by former Union General John Brown. The company's primary quarry was located at the site of the present-day Georgia State Capitol in Atlanta, where local workers had previously quarried granite for the state's original capitol building.\n\nBy the time the state began leasing convicts to the Georgia Granite Corporation, the company was already a major employer in the area, with a reputation for treating its workers well. In fact, many of the company's employees were former convicts who had been hired after their release. The company's president, John C. Bell, was a strong advocate for prison reform and believed that convict leasing was a way to rehabilitate prisoners and help them transition back into society.\n\nUnder the convict leasing system, the Georgia Granite Corporation was responsible for providing food, clothing, and other necessities for the prisoners. In return, the company received a daily rate for each prisoner, which it used to pay the prisoners' wages and the state's lease fee. The state also received a commission on the company's sales, which helped to offset the costs of the prison system.\n\nIn 1906, the state of Georgia ended its convict leasing program, citing concerns about the system's inefficiency and the fact that it was no longer financially viable. The Georgia Granite Corporation, however, continued to operate the quarry, using free laborers instead of convicts. The company remained in business until 1914, when it was sold to another company and the quarry eventually closed.\n\nSo, the answer to the question is that the processed rock was used for the construction of the Georgia State Capitol building in Atlanta."}

{"text":"\nAfter the civil war ended in 1865, the southern states were in ruins. The war had destroyed the South's economy, killed over 620,000 people (mostly men), and physically scarred the landscape. On top of that, the slaves were now free, and the South had to figure out what to do with its African-American population. So, the South did what it knew best how to do: it turned to the federal government for help. It appealed to President Andrew Johnson, a Democrat and former slave owner from Tennessee, for pardons and the right to rebuild the region. The South also looked to the federal government for ways to make money off its former slaves. \n\nUnder the 1863 Emancipation Proclamation, the Union army had confiscated Confederate property, including land and slaves. In 1865, the federal government established the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen and Abandoned Lands to sell this property and \"reconstruct\" the South. The Freedmen's Bureau had a broad mission: it was supposed to help former slaves, white southerners, and African Americans who had been free before the war. The Bureau was also supposed to help the freedmen find jobs and homes, and to educate and protect them. The Bureau operated in the South from 1865 to 1872. It was a huge, expensive operation. In its first year alone, the Bureau spent almost $7 million on relief efforts. In 1869, the federal government stopped funding the Bureau. In 1872, Congress finally withdrew federal troops from the South, which marked the end of Reconstruction.\n\nSo to answer the OP's question, the US was so seemingly more affected by the scars of slavery because the federal government was involved in the institution of slavery and its aftermath. The US government was directly involved in the institution of slavery as well as its aftermath.

Identity theft is a serious crime that can have a devastating effect on your financial and personal well-being.\n\nIdentity theft is not a new crime. As long as people have been using personal information to verify identity, there have been people who have used that information to commit fraud or other crimes. During the Middle Ages, when people traveled less and lived in smaller, more isolated communities, it was easier to verify someone's identity. People knew their neighbors and their business associates. They also didn't have to worry about credit reports, credit card accounts or bank loans. The closest thing they had to a credit report was their reputation in the community. But as society became more mobile and more transactions were conducted over long distances, it became harder to verify someone's identity.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, people used a variety of methods to verify someone's identity. One method was to use a seal. A seal was a stamp or a signet ring that was used to stamp or sign documents. A seal was often used to verify the authenticity of a document. Another method was to use a signature. A signature was a unique way of signing one's name that was used to verify the identity of the person who signed the document. A third method was to use a fingerprint. Fingerprints were used to verify the identity of the person who left the print.\n\nToday, we still use some of these methods to verify someone's identity. We use seals to verify the authenticity of documents such as diplomas and contracts. We use signatures to verify the identity of the person who signed a document. And we use fingerprints to verify the identity of the person who left the print. But we also use other methods, such as passwords and personal identification numbers (PINs), to verify someone's identity.\n\nIdentity theft is a crime that can have a devastating effect on your financial and personal well-being. It is important to take steps to protect your personal information and to be aware of the warning signs of identity theft. If you think you have been a victim of identity theft, you should report it to the police and take steps to protect your identity."}

Its reputation as a hotbed of political intrigue began in the early 1970s.\n\nWatergate has become a byword for political scandal since the 1970s.

The Watergate Hotel was the place where the Watergate Burglars broke into the Democratic Party's National Committee offices in 1972.\n\nIn the Watergate scandal that unfolded after the burglars were arrested, it was revealed that the Nixon administration had been involved in efforts to cover up its involvement in the burglary. The scandal eventually led to Nixon's resignation in 1974."}
{"text":"\n\nThere are a few historical reasons for why this stereotype exists. For one, there is the legacy of the American South being largely rural and agricultural, with families living on isolated farms, and also a higher rate of poverty. This meant that people were more likely to end up as neighbors, sometimes with no other options for marriage partners. \n\nAnother reason for this stereotype is the prevalence of inbreeding among the European upper classes in the South. It was not uncommon for Southern elites to marry their cousins, sometimes even first cousins, to keep wealth in the family. And, of course, the South has a long and complicated history with issues like slavery, which contributed to inbreeding among African Americans.\n\nInbreeding is, of course, more likely to lead to consanguineous (i.e. incestuous) relationships. And the South has a long history of inbreeding in all of the above populations. For these reasons, the idea of Southerners having more incestuous relationships than other parts of the country took hold in the popular imagination."}

{"text":"\n\nOn November 22, 1963, the Soviet Union's embassy in Washington took the extraordinary step of flying the flag at half-staff to mourn the death of President John F. Kennedy. JFK's murder was a shocking event that unified the American people, if only for a short time. The Soviet Union was in a state of high tension at the time, as the Cold War was at its peak and relations with the United States were at an all-time low.\n\nThe Soviet Union feared that the assassination of President Kennedy might be a prelude to American aggression, possibly even a nuclear first strike. The Soviets sent a message to Washington offering their condolences, and their embassy in Washington kept its flag at half-staff for the next 30 days. In spite of the tensions between the two superpowers, both sides took steps to ensure that the situation did not escalate into a nuclear war.\n\nIn the wake of the assassination, the Soviet Union had to walk a fine line between expressing its condolences and avoiding any action that might be construed as interfering in American affairs. The Soviet Union did not want to be seen as taking advantage of the situation, and it was also keenly aware of the need to maintain its own credibility. In the end, the Soviet Union was able to navigate this difficult situation and maintain its relationship with the United States.\n\nThe Soviet Union's reaction to the assassination of President Kennedy was a measured one, and it was able to maintain its relationship with the United States. It is a testament to the ability of the two superpowers to manage their differences and avoid a nuclear war."}

The casualization of American dress codes, the weakening of the institution of marriage, and the growing popularity of youth-oriented popular culture all suggest a society that is becoming less formal.\n\nHowever, there are also signs that American society is becoming more formal in certain ways. For example, the American legal system has become increasingly complex and formalized over the past century, with more laws being passed and more legal professionals being required to navigate this system. Additionally, the American economy has become more specialized and formalized, with more people working in white-collar jobs and less people working in blue-collar jobs.\n\nOverall, it seems that American society is becoming both more and less formal at the same time, with different aspects of society moving in different directions. It is likely that this trend will continue into the future, with American society continuing to evolve in complex and unpredictable ways."}
{"text":"\nIt's difficult to point to a single cause for the abolition of slavery worldwide. Instead, a combination of factors, including moral and religious beliefs, economic and political changes, and legal reforms, contributed to the end of slavery. \n\nOne important factor was the growing movement for abolition, which was led by people who argued that slavery was morally wrong and should be abolished. This movement gained momentum in the 19th century, and eventually led to the abolition of slavery in many countries. \n\nEconomic and political changes also played a role. In many countries, the industrial revolution led to a decline in the need for slave labor, as machines began to replace manual labor. At the same time, the growing popularity of free trade and the spread of democratic ideals also contributed to the abolition of slavery. \n\nLegal reforms were also important. In many countries, laws were passed that restricted the practice of slavery or made it illegal. These laws helped to bring an end to slavery in many places.\n\nOverall, the abolition of slavery was a complex process that was influenced by a variety of factors. It was not a single event, but rather a series of changes that took place over time."}

Kennedy appealed to voters' idealism, proclaiming that \"a new generation of leadership\" was ready to take the reins of government. Though he was only 43 at the time, JFK was in fact the youngest man ever elected to the office. Once in the White House, he was determined to preserve his youthful image and vigor. The President regularly played touch football, and he even installed a swimming pool in the White House. \n\nHe was also known for his sophisticated style, as personified by his wife, Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy. The First Lady restored the White House to its former glory and was known for her exquisite taste in clothes and decorating. As a result, the couple's time in the White House became known as \"Camelot,\" a reference to King Arthur's legendary court. The Kennedys were undeniably glamorous, and they became cultural icons during their time in the White House. The President was even featured on the cover of Time magazine twice.\n\nThough JFK's presidency was tragically cut short by an assassin's bullet, his legacy as a leader of American ideals endures.

{"text":"\n\nIn the 36 years between 1865 and 1901, three American Presidents were assassinated. For a modern first-world nation, that's a shockingly common occurrence.\n\nWhat effect did that have on the national psyche? Did any prominent figures reflect upon it publicly?\n\nIn a nation founded in a violent revolution, the Civil War, assassination was familiar. The country's first President, George Washington, was the target of at least two assassination attempts. Andrew Jackson survived multiple attempts, and his would-be assassin went on to try to kill him again while he was President. Abraham Lincoln's Secretary of State, William Seward, was also stabbed on the same night Lincoln was shot.\n\nThe frequency of presidential assassination attempts declined in the late 19th century, but that didn't prevent two of the three assassinations that occurred during that period.\n\nThe first was the assassination of President James A. Garfield in 1881. Garfield had been President for only a little more than four months when he was shot by a disturbed man who was later declared insane. Garfield did not die immediately; he lingered for more than two and a half months before succumbing. The assassin had aimed at the President's back, but the bullet was not fatal, lodging harmlessly in Garfield's body.\n\nThe second assassination of the period was that of President William McKinley in 1901. McKinley was shot twice by an anarchist who was protesting U.S. foreign policy. The second bullet was fatal.\n\nThe third assassination, that of President Abraham Lincoln, was the most famous. Lincoln was shot in the head while attending a play at Ford's Theater in Washington. He died the next morning.\n\nThe public reaction to these three assassinations was complex. For Garfield and McKinley, there was shock and grief, followed by an outpouring of affection for the fallen President. For Lincoln, there was also anger, even rage, directed at the South. In the North, the Civil War had just ended; in the South, the bitterness and divisiveness of that conflict had not yet healed.\n\nJohn Wilkes Booth, the assassin of Lincoln, was killed by Union soldiers while fleeing. A man named Lewis Powell tried to kill Secretary of State Seward at the same time. Seward survived, and Powell was executed.\n\nIn the years after Lincoln's assassination, Congress, the Supreme Court, and other government buildings were fortified. Presidential security was increased. The Secret Service was created to protect the President.\n\nThe three presidential assassinations of the late 19th and early 20th centuries were national events. They were followed closely in the press. The attempts on other government officials were widely reported as well. The American public was well aware of the dangers that lurked for the President and those close to him."}

{"text":"\n\nThe 18th Amendment was the product of decades of effort by the temperance movement to curb the social and economic damage caused by heavy drinking in the United States. In the 19th century, drunkenness, alcohol-fueled violence, and alcohol addiction had become a widespread and persistent public health issue. Drinking was also linked to other ills of society, such as spousal and child abuse, and many people believed that alcohol was a primary cause of poverty and other social problems.\n\nAfter decades of lobbying, temperance groups, religious organizations, and other concerned citizens were able to push through the 21st Amendment, which began Prohibition. This amendment banned the production, sale, and transportation of alcohol. It was ratified in 1919 and went into effect a year later.\n\nThe ban on alcohol was difficult to enforce, and the nation's experience with Prohibition contributed to the repeal of the 18th Amendment in 1933. The 21st Amendment specifically repealed the 18th Amendment and allowed the importation and sale of beer and wine into states that had previously allowed it. In addition, some states, such as California and New York, repealed their own statewide bans on alcohol. The repeal of Prohibition was a major victory for the alcohol industry and for opponents of the 18th Amendment."}

These messengers carried edicts from the Khan to his far-flung subjects, but they also provided a crucial link between the Mongols and the peoples they conquered.

{"text":"\nIn 1807, the New Jersey state legislature voted to restrict voting rights to white males, making New Jersey the last of the original 13 states to do so. The legislature believed that voting rights should be restricted to men of property, as this would ensure that only men with a stake in society could participate in the political process. This view was consistent with the prevailing view in the United States at the time, which was that voting rights should be restricted to white males. However, the state legislature's decision to restrict voting rights to white males was not without controversy. Many people, including women and racial minorities, felt that their voices were not being heard in the political process and that they were being denied the right to vote. In fact, New Jersey's decision to restrict voting rights to white males was one of the main reasons why the state became a hotbed of abolitionist activity in the years leading up to the Civil War. The state's decision to restrict voting rights to white males was eventually reversed in 1875, when the state legislature passed a law allowing all adult residents of the state to vote. This law was a significant step forward in the struggle for voting rights in the United States, and it helped to ensure that all citizens had a voice in the political process."}

They did this by force (the Marshall Plan was not a gift) and by enticing countries with the prospect of joining the world's wealthiest club.\n\nThe USSR was also trying to own the world, but it was doing so by a very different, and opposed, method. It too wanted to be the wealthiest club, but it also wanted to be the most powerful and influential country in the world. This was diametrically opposed to the idea of a \"free world\", and so a Cold War began, in which the USSR and the US attempted to win over the rest of the world to their point of view.\n\nThis wasn't just an economic war, but a war of ideas. The USSR was the first major country to achieve successful Communism, and so it had the home field advantage. The US was forced to counter it on all fronts, and to that end, it supported corrupt governments, overthrew legitimate ones, and generally interfered with any government that even looked like it might lean Communist.\n\nThe USSR made the same moves, but it also had the advantage of being an alternative to the US. It could promise all the benefits of Communism without the coercion of the US, and many countries willingly joined the Warsaw Pact.\n\nThe Korean War was the first major proxy war of this new Cold War. The USSR had supported the Communist North Korea, and the US supported the non-Communist South Korea. China got involved on the Communist side, and the US got involved on the non-Communist side. It was the first of many proxy wars in this Cold War."}

{"text":"\n\nThe president's pardon power is found in Article II, Section 2, Clause 1 of the U.S. Constitution. It states: \"The President ... shall have Power to Grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offenses against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment.\"\n\nThe president's pardon power is one of the least limited powers the Constitution grants to the president. While the founders were concerned about giving the president too much power, they determined that the pardon power was necessary. In Federalist No. 74, Alexander Hamilton wrote: \"The president would be impeachable by the House of Representatives for treason or bribery and by the Senate for maladministration. He would, therefore, be subject to the control of one or the other of these bodies for his conduct in office.\"\n\nHamilton continued: \"The Executive would have nothing to fear from the judiciary, while the judiciary would have a sufficient check upon the Executive through the medium of impeachment.\" Hamilton concluded that the president's pardon power was necessary to ensure the \"public good\" would be achieved."}

They were often accused of crimes they did not commit and sometimes blamed for natural disasters like plagues and floods. Sometimes, groups of people would attack Jews and steal their property. This was often done under the pretense of \"cleansing\" a town of evil. This led to many Jews being accused of witchcraft.\n\nBecause of their religious beliefs, Jews were also often accused of being in league with the Devil. This was a common belief during the Middle Ages. Many people believed that Jews and witches were working together to destroy Christianity. This led to many Jews being accused of being witches.\n\nThere are also some historical accounts of Jews being burned at the stake for being witches. This was a common punishment for witches during the Middle Ages. It is not known how many Jews were actually burned as witches, but it is known that many Jews were accused of being witches and were killed as a result."}

The Americans would have needed to bring all their supplies with them, including food, water, and tools. They would have also needed to find a way to communicate with the locals and to purchase land from them. This would have been a major undertaking, requiring a great deal of planning and preparation. It is likely that the Americans would have needed to establish a base on one of the nearby islands, such as Hawaii or New Zealand, and then make the journey to Tahiti from there.

{"text":"\nIn the late sixteenth century, when Europe first encountered The Art of War, China was at the height of its imperial power. The Ming dynasty had recently united the country, and was in the process of trying to expand its control over its neighbors. It was also during this time that the Manchu people, who would go on to found the Qing dynasty, were moving into northern China. This was a time of great upheaval and change in China, and as a result, The Art of War was one of the first books to be translated into a Western language.\n\nThe initial reaction to The Art of War in Europe was mixed. On the one hand, Europeans were fascinated by the book and its insights into Chinese culture and warfare. On the other hand, they were also wary of its potential as a tool for espionage. In the end, The Art of War was seen as a valuable resource for understanding China and its military strategies, but its influence on European warfare was limited."}

In fact, comedian Frank Gorshin had already been doing a dead-on Buckley impression on The Tonight Show for years.\n\nSo when the creators of Aladdin were looking for someone to voice the fast-talking, quick-witted Genie, they turned to Robin Williams, who was known for his skill at doing celebrity impressions. Williams, who had been a fan of Buckley's show since the 1970s, was thrilled to get the chance to do an impression of Buckley. He even got to meet Buckley and interview him on Firing Line.\n\nBuckley was a prominent figure in the political scene in the early 1990s, and his show was a popular forum for discussing current events and politics. So it's no surprise that Williams felt it was important to include two impressions of Buckley in Aladdin. They are a perfect encapsulation of the fast-paced, quick-witted world of the Genie, and they provide a humorous nod to one of the most influential figures of the time."}

It was also seen as a way to punish the person who had been banished.\n\nExile was used in ancient times, as well as in the Middle Ages. It was used by many different cultures. However, it was not used as often in modern times. This was because there were other ways to punish people. For example, prisons were created. Also, exile was not always effective.

One theory is that the Romans were not interested in Ireland because it was too far away and there was no obvious benefit to be gained from invading the island. Another theory is that the Romans were deterred by the dangerous waters around Ireland and the strength of the Irish tribes. Whatever the reason, Ireland was never conquered by the Romans and it remains one of the few places in the world that was never ruled by the Roman Empire."}

The reasoning behind this was that they could use this fleet to defend themselves against the Persians. However, the Spartans viewed this as a threat to their military dominance.

In addition, the idea of a \"West\" and an \"East\" is often seen as being too simplistic, as it implies that these two regions are somehow completely distinct from each other, when in fact there have been many cultural exchanges and influences between them.\n\nThe idea of a Western civilisation is also problematic because it tends to be seen as being based on the achievements of the ancient Greeks and Romans.

{"text":"\nPre-Columbian Caribbean cultures didn't develop a strong maritime culture like the Mediterranean did for a variety of reasons. First, the Caribbean is a much smaller body of water than the Mediterranean, making it more difficult to build and maintain a large enough fleet of ships to support a strong maritime culture. Second, the Caribbean is much more geographically diverse than the Mediterranean, with many more islands and reefs that would have made navigation and trade more difficult. Third, the Caribbean is much further from the center of the ancient world, making it more difficult to maintain trade and cultural connections with the rest of the world. Finally, the Caribbean was not as rich in natural resources as the Mediterranean, making it less attractive for trade and exploration. All of these factors combined to make it more difficult for Caribbean cultures to develop a strong maritime culture like the one that flourished in the Mediterranean."}

The stereotype is often used in a negative way to make fun of gay men or to portray them as less masculine. The stereotype is also used in a positive way to show that gay men are more expressive and creative. The origin of the gay accent is not clear, but it may have originated in the way gay men were portrayed in media and entertainment. In the 1950s, for example, gay characters were often depicted as flamboyant and effeminate, which may have contributed to the development of the stereotype.

The modern-day North and South Korea were established after World War II, with the division of Korea along the 38th parallel.\n\nNorth Korea is a socialist state, with a centrally planned economy and a totalitarian government. The country is ruled by the Kim family, which has been in power since the country's establishment. The economy is largely based on agriculture, but the country has suffered from food shortages and famine in the past. The country has also been subject to international sanctions, which have made it difficult for the country to import food.\n\nThe country's food shortages have been caused by a combination of factors, including the country's economic policies, natural disasters, and international sanctions. The country's economic policies have focused on heavy industry, while neglecting agriculture. Natural disasters, such as floods and droughts, have also contributed to the food shortages. The international sanctions have made it difficult for the country to import food, and have also limited the country's access to foreign investment and technology.\n\nDespite the challenges, North Korea has been able to feed its citizens, thanks to the country's emphasis on self-sufficiency and the government's efforts to ensure that everyone has access to food.

{"text":"\n\nThe World Atlas of Flags has some interesting insights into why most flags are rectangular. Apparently, it's because the flag evolved from the standards and pennants flown by medieval knights. These were long and thin because they had to be attached to a lance. From there, it's easy to see how the design would evolve into a flag. Rectangular flags are also more practical. They're easy to make, easy to fly, and easy to recognize. In a way, it's surprising that more countries don't use a non-rectangular design. But if you look at the flags that break this trend, they're often the flags of smaller nations, such as Nepal and Switzerland. These countries are much more open to experimentation. For larger countries, a non-rectangular flag would be much harder to recognize from a distance. It would also be much harder to manufacture on a large scale. And finally, it would be harder to fly. So while it's fun to think about alternative flag designs, it's also worth thinking about the practicalities."}

Another theory suggests they were murdered by the KGB.\n\nBut there are other theories, too. One of these is that the hikers were killed by an extraterrestrial creature.\n\nAnother theory, which has gained traction in recent years, is that the hikers were exposed to lethal levels of radiation.\n\nWhen the bodies of the hikers were discovered, their clothing was found to have traces of radioactive isotopes, and one of the victims had a gray pallor. These findings fueled speculation that the hikers had been attacked by aliens, or that they had uncovered some kind of secret military facility in the mountains.\n\nIn the 1990s, researchers studied the medical records of the hikers and discovered that one of the victims had suffered from a \"compression fracture of the third lumbar vertebra,\" which is usually caused by extreme physical trauma.\n\nThis finding cast doubt on the theory that the hikers had died in an avalanche, as such an injury is rarely caused by an avalanche.\n\nIn 2014, Russian researchers proposed another explanation: that the hikers had been exposed to lethal doses of radiation.\n\nThe researchers analyzed soil samples from the site where the hikers had been camping and found that the area was contaminated with radioactive elements.\n\nThey also found that the clothing of the hikers had absorbed high levels of radiation, and that the gray pallor of one of the victims was likely caused by the absorption of radionuclides.\n\nThe researchers concluded that the hikers had likely been exposed to radiation while they were camping in the mountains, and that this exposure had likely caused their deaths.\n\nWhile the cause of the Dyatlov Pass incident remains a mystery, the latest research suggests that the hikers were not killed by an alien creature, but by the lethal effects of radiation."}

The technique was used to modify the design of the press so that it could be used to print from left-to-right, rather than from right-to-left.

{"text":"\n\nIn the middle ages, the armies were generally segregated by weapon type. The most common type of army in medieval Europe was the foot soldier, and these soldiers were typically equipped with a variety of weapons. The most common type of weapon was the sword, and soldiers were often divided into two groups: the heavy infantry, who carried large swords, and the light infantry, who carried smaller swords. The heavy infantry would typically be equipped with a variety of other weapons, such as axes, maces, and spears. The light infantry would also be equipped with a variety of weapons, such as javelins, bows, and slings.\n\nIn addition to the foot soldiers, there were also armies that were composed of mounted soldiers. These soldiers would typically be equipped with a variety of weapons, such as swords, lances, and axes. The mounted soldiers would also be equipped with a variety of other weapons, such as maces, javelins, and bows.\n\nThe segregation of weapon types in medieval armies was a result of the development of different types of weapons and the need for specialized soldiers to use them. The sword, for example, was a relatively expensive weapon, and it was not practical for every soldier to be equipped with one. Similarly, the lance was a specialized weapon that required a great deal of training to use effectively. The segregation of weapon types allowed for the creation of specialized units within the army, such as the heavy infantry and the light infantry. This allowed the army to be more flexible and effective in battle."}
{"text":"\n\nBefore the 1940s, fewer than 1 in 100 African American children had a non-traditional name. The rate started to rise in the '40s, when only 1 in 10 African American children had a non-traditional name. By the 1990s, it was about half of all African American children.\n\nThe rise of black names can be traced to the late 19th century, when former slaves were first allowed to have last names. Many chose the last names of their former owners, often wealthy white men. But as African Americans moved into cities, they began to take on new names. In the late 19th century, it became fashionable for African Americans to have biblical or French names. And in the 20th century, the trend continued.\n\nThe trend accelerated in the 1960s and '70s, when the Black Power movement encouraged African Americans to use traditional African names. And in the 1990s, a new wave of African American names swept the country. Today, it's common to see African American children with names like Aaliyah, Aisha, and Kareem.\n\nThe trend has continued into the 21st century, and now more than ever, African American parents are looking for unique names for their children."}
{"text":"\n\nBefore the advent of motorized vehicles, cities had a different kind of \"horse problem.\" Dead horses were a common sight on urban streets, and a much-hated one. Horses were essential to the functioning of cities, so their bodies had to be dealt with in some fashion. Generally, they were hauled away, but not before causing a bit of a stink and a public health hazard. In New York City, for instance, the practice was to leave dead horses on the streets until they were \"disposed of.\" That disposal could take some time.\n\nThe problem was particularly acute in London, which was home to tens of thousands of horses. The city had neither the land nor the facilities to bury all of them. And so, as London grew more and more crowded, the dead horses kept piling up. By the mid-19th century, the situation had become untenable.\n\nThe answer to the problem was staring Londoners in the face: The city's thousands of cats would devour the flesh of the dead horses. And so, in 1866, a law was passed requiring the bodies of dead horses to be placed in \"hanging cradles,\" then hoisted into the air and left for the local cats to do their work. The law remained in place for nearly a century, until motorized vehicles rendered it obsolete."}

At the same time, they became increasingly dissatisfied with their country's dependence on the United States for trade and raw materials. In an effort to address these concerns, the Japanese military began to pursue an aggressive policy of expansion in the 1930s. This policy culminated in the attack on Pearl Harbor and the subsequent Pacific War.\n\nDuring the war, Japanese leaders believed that they could achieve several objectives through the conquest and occupation of China.

In the Bronze Age, wealth was concentrated in the hands of a small number of powerful rulers. The rest of the population struggled to survive. \n\nThe most valuable commodity in the Bronze Age was land. Kings and other elites owned most of the land, and they used it to extract wealth from the people who lived on it. The people who worked the land had to give up a large portion of what they produced to the king and other elites. This system of land ownership and exploitation was the primary driver of inequality in the Bronze Age. \n\nIn addition to land, kings and other elites also controlled access to other resources, such as water and minerals. They used these resources to further enrich themselves and their families, while the rest of the population was left to fend for themselves. \n\nThe Bronze Age was a time of great technological and cultural change.

{"text":"\n\nIn the 17th century, the word \"extinct\" did not yet exist in the modern sense. The last aurochs died in the Jaktor\u00f3w Forest of Poland in 1627, but nobody at the time would have known that this meant the end of the species. Even if they had known, it would not have meant much to them. Aurochs were already long gone from Western Europe, and in the rest of Europe they were only found in the far-away east.\n\nThe last aurochs was a female, and was killed by a hunter named Gostynin. According to one account, he was so proud of his feat that he had the animal stuffed and mounted, and sent it to the King of Poland as a gift. The King was not impressed, and had the animal sent back to Gostynin, who in turn donated it to the University of Krak\u00f3w.\n\nThe stuffed aurochs was put on display in the university's botanical garden. It was later destroyed in a fire, and only a drawing of it remains. In the drawing, the aurochs looks somewhat like a buffalo, with a large head, curved horns, and a thick body.\n\nIt would be almost 300 years before the idea of extinction gained widespread acceptance. This was largely thanks to the work of Charles Darwin, who in 1859 published his famous book On the Origin of Species. In it, he argued that species evolve over time, and that some become extinct as others take their place. This idea was radical at the time, but it has since become accepted by the scientific community.\n\nToday, the concept of extinction is well-established in the scientific community. Scientists have identified several species that have gone extinct in recent years, including the black rhinoceros and the woolly mammoth.\n\nWhile the idea of extinction was not widely accepted in the 17th century, it is clear that people were aware that certain species were disappearing. For example, in 1676, the English naturalist John Ray wrote that the aurochs was \"now very rare, and in danger of being lost\".\n\nIt is also worth noting that the idea of extinction was not unknown in the ancient world. For example, the Greek philosopher Epicurus wrote in the 3rd century BC that \"the sun will eventually engulf the earth, and then the human race will be extinct\".\n\nIn conclusion, it is clear that people in the 17th century were aware that certain species were disappearing.

It was one of the most misogynistic texts ever written, and in it Kramer called for the eradication of witches by burning, a solution he believed would save both the world and the church. The Malleus Maleficarum enjoyed great popularity during the time of the Inquisition, when it was used as a manual for witch-hunters. It also served as a justification for the persecution of witches. The Malleus Maleficarum was second in sales only to the Bible until it was banned by the Pope in the 17th century.\n\nThe church's attitude toward magic and witchcraft was one of skepticism until the publication of the Malleus Maleficarum. It was at this point that the church began to take the subject of magic seriously and to view it as a threat to Christianity. This shift in attitude was due in part to the influence of the Malleus Maleficarum. The treatise was widely accepted because it provided a justification for the persecution of witches and a manual for witch-hunters. It also served to spread fear of magic and witchcraft throughout Europe. The Malleus Maleficarum was a key text in the development of the Inquisition and the persecution of witches."}
{"text":"\nThe movie Django Unchained is set in the year 1858, a time when bounties were indeed offered for criminals. At that time, many people were opposed to the institution of slavery. Some abolitionists went so far as to fund the capture and execution of slave owners. As a result, slave owners were targeted by bounty hunters.\n\nA famous example is the case of the slave ship Amistad. In 1839, a group of Africans revolted and killed many of the crew on board a Spanish slave ship. They attempted to sail the ship back to Africa but were unsuccessful. They ended up in the United States where they were arrested and charged with murder. The US government wanted to try them and reclaim the slaves, but Spain claimed ownership of the slaves and wanted them to be returned to Cuba. A legal battle ensued and in 1841 the US Supreme Court ruled that the Africans were illegally enslaved and had to be freed. This ruling angered many Southerners who felt that the court had overstepped its bounds and was now telling them what they could and couldn't do with their slaves. The case was yet another factor pushing the South towards secession and eventually the Civil War."}
{"text":"\n\nThe Bible Belt is an informal term for an area of the United States where there are many people who identify as Evangelical Christians. This area is typically located in the southern and midwestern regions of the country, and it is often seen as a conservative and religious part of the United States.\n\nThe origins of the Bible Belt can be traced back to the early 1800s, when many people in the United States began to identify as Evangelical Christians. This was due in part to the Second Great Awakening, a religious revival that took place in the United States in the early 1800s. The Second Great Awakening led to a surge in the number of people who identified as Evangelical Christians, and it also helped to spread the teachings of Evangelical Christianity throughout the United States.\n\nOver time, the number of people who identified as Evangelical Christians in the United States continued to grow, and the Bible Belt became a prominent feature of the country's religious landscape. Today, the Bible Belt is home to many Evangelical churches and Christian universities, and it is a major center of Evangelical Christianity in the United States."}
{"text":"\nThe United States paid for Alaska in 1867 with roughly $7.2 million in gold. The agreed-upon price was $7.2 million, but the United States only paid roughly $6 million since it received full title to the land. The agreed-upon price was based on the estimated value of Alaska's natural resources and not its land area.\n\nThe gold was transported from San Francisco to New York via the Portland, a U.S. Navy sloop-of-war. To transport the gold, the ship's guns and ammunition were removed, and replaced with 200 ingots of gold. The total value of the gold transported was roughly $6 million. The rest of the $7.2 million payment was sent to Russia in the form of U.S. bonds."}

He was a child prodigy, born in Salzburg, Austria, and began to play the piano at age 3. By age 6, he had composed his first piece of music.\n\nIn his early teens, Mozart became a court musician in Salzburg and began to compose prolifically. He took on many different projects, including operas, symphonies, and sonatas. His compositions were popular among the public and critics alike, and he was soon recognized as a genius.\n\nHowever, Mozart's genius did not translate into financial success. He was always broke and often had to borrow money from friends and patrons. He also had a controversial personality and was not always embraced by the public at large.\n\nIn his time, Mozart was recognized as a true genius by his peers, but not necessarily by the public at large. His work was popular among critics and the public, but he was not always embraced by the public at large. His financial struggles and controversial personality may have contributed to his lack of universal recognition."}
{"text":"\n\nThe Colosseum is an oval amphitheater in the center of Rome where gladiators once fought for their life. The largest amphitheater ever built was constructed from sand and stone over eight years, from AD72 to AD80. The colossal structure could hold 80,000 spectators. Dramatic and sometimes horrifying events occurred here, not just in gladiatorial games but also in animal hunts, executions, and re-enactments of famous battles. Partially damaged by earthquakes and stone robbers over the centuries, the Colosseum is still an iconic memento of Roman history, visited by thousands of tourists every year. \n\nModern construction costs are calculated per square meter, so it's difficult to get an accurate price for the Colosseum's construction without detailed architectural plans. One of the largest structures of its kind, it would be an ambitious and costly project. One recent reconstruction project at the Colosseum site used iron rods and concrete to strengthen the structure. The project cost \u20ac25 million ($29.5 million), which works out at around \u20ac735 ($825) per square meter. This would make the Colosseum today worth around \u20ac23.7 billion ($28.75 billion)."}
{"text":"\nThe Romans did fill amphitheatres with water to simulate naval battles. This was a common practice in Roman times, and it was done for a variety of reasons. One reason was that it allowed the Romans to stage naval battles in the heart of Rome, which was not possible in real life. Another reason was that it allowed the Romans to create a more realistic and immersive experience for the audience. Finally, filling the amphitheatre with water also had practical benefits, such as cooling the audience in the hot summer months and providing a more even surface for the actors to perform on."}
{"text":"\nThe psychological warfare campaign waged by the United States against Japan in the lead-up to the 1944 Battle of Saipan included leaflet propaganda. The United States dropped hundreds of thousands of leaflets over Japan, urging Japanese soldiers and civilians to surrender. The campaign was a complete failure. Japanese forces on Saipan fought almost to the last man, and the civilian population of Saipan committed mass suicide rather than surrender. It's not clear whether the Saipan leaflet campaign had any effect at all.\n\nThere is evidence that psychological warfare, including the use of leaflets, was a factor in the rapid collapse of German defenses in the final stages of the Battle of Normandy. But that was a rare case in which the target population was literate, and the leaflets were in the target population's native language. In most cases, propaganda leaflets have had little or no effect on enemy behavior."}
{"text":"\nThe earliest Japanese histories, the Kojiki and Nihonshoki, were written in the early 8th century, some two hundred years after the events they describe. Before that time, the Japanese had no writing system, and history was passed on by word of mouth. It's likely that the earliest Japanese historians had never even heard of Himiko.\n\nAnother possibility is that she was deliberately left out of the official histories because she was a woman. Women in early Japan were not allowed to rule, and the existence of a powerful woman like Himiko was an embarrassment to the male-dominated government.\n\nYet another possibility is that the Chinese and Korean sources that mention Himiko are unreliable. The Chinese and Korean governments of the time may have wanted to control Japan, and so they invented a figure like Himiko to give themselves a justification for their interference."}
{"text":"\nThe Republic of Venice was much more powerful and influential than other Italian republics based around port cities (Genoa, Pisa) because it was able to maintain its independence and thrive for more than a millennium. The Republic of Venice was able to maintain its independence because it was located in a strategic position on the Adriatic Sea, which allowed it to control trade in the Mediterranean. The Republic of Venice was also able to thrive for more than a millennium because it was able to maintain a strong economy and a stable government. The Republic of Venice was able to maintain a strong economy because it was able to trade with other countries and because it had a well-developed banking system.

{"text":"\n\nHoward Phillips Lovecraft was a sickly child who became a recluse, rarely interacting with anyone outside his family. He was raised in a wealthy home environment, and his racism can partly be attributed to the fear of miscegenation (race mixing) that was common among the New England elite at the time.\n\nLovecraft's racism was not unusual for the time in which he lived. Both blacks and whites of the era were frequently exposed to the ideology of scientific racism, which was used to justify the subjugation of people of color. Lovecraft was particularly influenced by the work of American eugenicist Charles Davenport.\n\nLovecraft's racism is seen most clearly in his many horror stories. In particular, \"The Horror at Red Hook\" (1927) explicitly connects blackness with otherness and monstrosity. It also promotes eugenics as a means of purifying the human race. Lovecraft's racism is also evident in his letters and other private writings, such as his disgust with miscegenation and his belief in the inferiority of blacks.\n\nIn sum, while Lovecraft's racism was extreme even for his time, it was not unusual. His work reflects the scientific racism and nativism that were common in the United States during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries."}

{"text":"\n\nSoviet computer technology was at the center of the global computing race throughout the second half of the twentieth century. In the immediate aftermath of World War II, Soviet engineers adapted foreign computing technologies to Soviet industrial and military needs, giving the USSR its own, homegrown computer industry. The first electronic computers in the USSR were created between 1946 and 1951. They were the MESM (Small Electronic Calculating Machine) series, designed by Sergei Lebedev. However, because of the MESM series' limited capacity, only a few were produced, and the series was soon replaced by imported U.S. computer technology.\n\nThe next wave of Soviet computing began with the development of the BESM series mainframe computers. The BESM-1 was developed in 1955 and was the first electronic computer manufactured in the USSR. The BESM-6, the most powerful model in the series, was a widely used mainframe that was comparable to the best mainframes developed in the West. The BESM series was used in many fields, including nuclear weapons research, space exploration, and economic planning.\n\nThe Soviet Union launched the Sputnik satellite in 1957, jumpstarting a decades-long competition with the United States dubbed the \"Space Race.\" The Space Race drove advances in Soviet computer technology. In 1958, the USSR developed the first stored-program mainframe computer in the country, the M-20. This was followed by the development of the M-220, which was the first computer in the USSR that could operate in both binary and decimal number systems. These early Soviet mainframes used the Alpha programming language, which was a high-level language similar to FORTRAN.\n\nIn the late 1950s, the Soviet Union developed the first electronic computer in Europe capable of operating in real time. This achievement laid the foundation for the creation of the country's first operating system, the Moscow Real-Time Operating System (OS). The Moscow OS was used in military and industrial applications. It allowed for multiple users to access the same mainframe simultaneously, which was a new concept at the time.\n\nThe USSR was also the first country to develop a specialized computer for word processing. Called the Electronika, the word-processing computer was developed in the 1960s. The Soviet Union also developed the first computers with integrated circuits, the M-10 and M-20 computers.\n\nDespite these early successes, Soviet computing technology lagged behind the West throughout the 1970s and 1980s. This was in part because of the USSR's isolation from Western computer technology and the general decline of the Soviet computer industry. However, Soviet computing also suffered from low funding, which was diverted to the military and space programs. Soviet computer scientists made many important contributions to the field, but they were often hampered by the lack of resources and the secrecy of the USSR's computer industry."}
{"text":"\n\nThe difference between a commonwealth and a state is pretty simple. A commonwealth is a country, while a state is one of the 50 member states of the United States of America. A commonwealth is an independent nation, while a state is subject to the U.S. Constitution and federal law.\n\nThat's the simple difference, but the word commonwealth has a more complicated and contested history. Today, four states in the United States call themselves commonwealths: Kentucky, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Virginia. They're called commonwealths, but they're really states. The only states in the United States that are not considered commonwealths are Alaska and Hawaii.\n\nBefore they were states, Virginia and Massachusetts were self-governing territories. In 1776, the Virginia legislature adopted a declaration of rights that would have made Virginia a commonwealth, but the Virginia delegates to the Continental Congress voted against the declaration. The Massachusetts Provincial Congress, a revolutionary government, adopted the Massachusetts State Constitution in 1780, but it, too, was rejected by the people of Massachusetts. Kentucky and Pennsylvania both became states in 1792, but both had periods where they considered changing their names to commonwealth.\n\nIn each case, the use of the word commonwealth was a political statement. The term commonwealth was used to distinguish the new states from the original 13 colonies, which had rebelled against the British monarchy. The new states were republican, and the word commonwealth helped to distinguish them from the former colonies.\n\nIt was also a way to differentiate the new states from the federal government. The federal government was seen as a threat to the states' rights, and the word commonwealth helped to emphasize the states' independence.\n\nThe use of the word commonwealth also had a practical purpose. It was a way to emphasize the states' shared interests and goals. The states were all part of the same union, and the word commonwealth helped to emphasize that fact.\n\nThe word commonwealth was also a way to differentiate the new states from the states of Europe. The United States was seen as a new and different kind of state, and the word commonwealth helped to emphasize that fact.\n\nThe use of the word commonwealth was a way to emphasize the states' shared interests and goals.

{"text":"\nThe founding fathers admired the Roman Republic, and they used it as a model for our own Constitution. The United States was founded as a republic, which is a country that is not ruled by a monarchy (a king or queen) or dictator, but rather by elected leaders. The Roman Republic was also a republic. \n\nOne issue with the Roman Republic that the founding fathers tried to improve on was the fact that it was unstable. The Roman Republic had a long history of civil wars and political strife. The founding fathers wanted to create a more stable government for the United States. To do this, they wrote a Constitution that would outline the powers of the government and the rights of the people. They also created a system of checks and balances, which would help to prevent any one branch of government from becoming too powerful. \n\nAnother issue with the Roman Republic that the founding fathers tried to improve on was the fact that it was not very democratic. In the Roman Republic, only a small number of people had the right to vote. The founding fathers wanted to create a more democratic government for the United States. To do this, they wrote a Constitution that would guarantee the right to vote to all adult citizens.

{"text":"\nNeutrality as a permanent principle of Swiss foreign policy was formally established by the Treaty of Paris of 1516. Switzerland was one of the beneficiaries of the European system of collective security embodied in the Peace of Westphalia (1648). During the Thirty Years' War (1618-48), it was able to maintain its neutrality, in spite of the fact that it was a confederation of small states without a central authority. The system of permanent alliances among the European powers that developed after the Peace of Westphalia left Switzerland no less capable of defending itself than the larger states. In fact, Switzerland was more capable of defense than most of the smaller states, which had to bear the double burden of sovereignty and defense. The Swiss Confederation was able to maintain its neutrality in the face of the various European conflicts of the 18th century because these conflicts did not directly threaten the security of the Confederation. The establishment of a balance of power in Europe, based on the separation of the great powers, made it unlikely that any one state would attempt to dominate the others. The Congress of Vienna (1814-15) reaffirmed the principles of the balance of power in Europe.\n\nThe maintenance of Swiss neutrality during the 19th century was a function of the general respect that European states accorded it. When this respect began to weaken at the end of the century, the Swiss Federal Council began to worry about the country's security. In the event of a conflict between two of the great powers, Switzerland would be unable to count on outside assistance. To maintain its security, Switzerland had to assure its territorial integrity. The only way to do this was to make sure that no state had any reason to invade it. Thus, the policy of neutrality had to be combined with a policy of armed strength. This was the basis of the military strategy developed by the Swiss General Henri Dufour in the years 1889-1914."}
{"text":"\n\nThe idea of democracy was first conceived in ancient Greece, but it was not until the Age of Enlightenment in the 17th and 18th centuries that it began to be implemented. During this time, thinkers like John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau argued for the rights of individuals and for the need for government to be based on the consent of the people. This led to the development of representative democracies, in which citizens elected representatives to make laws and govern on their behalf.\n\nDespite these advances, democracy was not widely adopted. In fact, most of the world's population lived under monarchies during the 17th and 18th centuries. This was due to a variety of factors, including the belief that monarchs were more able to make decisions on behalf of their subjects, the need for strong central authority in times of war and crisis, and the fact that only a small percentage of the population had the right to vote. It was not until the 19th and 20th centuries that democracy began to gain popularity and become the dominant form of government."}

The Romans and the Germanic tribes to their east had problems with seaborne raids from the northern lands. These raids were launched by the Vikings, who established settlements in the northern lands, including modern-day Denmark and Norway.\n\nThe Romans called the northern lands \"Barbaricum\" which means \"land of the barbarians\" because the people who lived there were not like the Romans.

Before this epic poem was written, hell was viewed as a place of punishment for eternity. It was a place where you suffered for all eternity. In Dante's work, he made a nine-circle hell. Each of these circles had a different type of sin and a different type of punishment. This changed the view of hell to more of a purgatory. People started viewing hell as a place you go to suffer for a certain amount of time before you can move on to heaven.

However, by the 19th century, it had become known as the \"sick man of Europe,\" and it finally collapsed in 1923. There are many reasons why the Ottoman Empire declined over the centuries, including military defeats, economic problems, and political unrest. Here are some of the key factors that contributed to the decline of the Ottoman Empire:\n\nMilitary Defeats: The Ottoman Empire faced a number of military defeats in the 18th and 19th centuries, which weakened its power and influence. For example, it lost the Battle of Vienna in 1683, which marked the beginning of its decline. It also suffered defeats in the Russo-Turkish War of 1768-1774 and the Napoleonic Wars of 1806-1812. These military losses contributed to the empire's decline.\n\nEconomic Problems: The Ottoman Empire also faced economic problems in the 18th and 19th centuries. It had a large budget deficit and was dependent on foreign loans to finance its military campaigns. The empire also suffered from a decline in trade and a decrease in the value of its currency. These economic problems hindered the empire's ability to modernize and compete with other European states.\n\nPolitical Unrest: The Ottoman Empire also experienced political unrest in the 19th century. There were a number of rebellions and uprisings, and the empire faced challenges to its authority. The empire also had problems with succession, as it went through a series of rulers in the 19th century. These political challenges further weakened the empire.\n\nOverall, the combination of military defeats, economic problems, and political unrest contributed to the decline of the Ottoman Empire. By the 19th century, it had become the \"sick man of Europe,\" and it finally collapsed in 1923."}

{"text":"\n\nMany people left the Victorian countryside to move to the cities. There were many reasons why people decided to do this. One reason was that cities offered more job opportunities. There was a bigger demand for labor in the cities than in the countryside. Also, people who lived in the countryside often did not own the land that they lived on. Many of them worked as sharecroppers. This means that they had to give a certain percentage of their crops to the landowner. This was very unfair. In the cities, people could be paid fair wages for their work.\n\nAnother reason why people moved to the cities was because of the poor living conditions in the countryside. Many people lived in small cottages that were badly built and had thatched roofs. They were often damp and cold. Also, the cottages were often overcrowded because families had many children. There was also a lack of privacy in the countryside. Many families shared a common outhouse.\n\nPeople also moved to the cities because they thought that life in the city was more exciting. They could go to the theater and the opera. There were also more opportunities for education in the cities."}
{"text":"\n\nMost people are aware that Ireland was once its own small kingdom, fiercely independent, and that it was once part of Great Britain. Few people realize that Ireland once exerted a powerful influence over parts of Great Britain, or that it was once home to a series of very important kingdoms, the remains of which dot the Irish landscape to this day. And almost no one is aware that Ireland's history did not end with the Norman invasion of 1169, the arrival of Strongbow and his army, or even the Battle of Kinsale in 1602. In fact, the last vestiges of Gaelic Ireland, the old Irish language, culture, and laws, hung on well into the seventeenth century.\n\nIreland's Middle Ages, therefore, lasted almost a full millennium, from around the time of the Viking invasions of the ninth century to the beginnings of the Stuart era in the late sixteenth century. But the Middle Ages in Ireland, or Insula Sancta Hiberniae (the Holy Island of Ireland) as it was known to the medieval world, was not a time of unrelenting violence, warfare, and destruction. To be sure, warfare and political conflict were common, but the Middle Ages in Ireland was also a time of remarkable achievements in the fields of learning and the arts, of economic expansion, and of remarkable engineering and architectural feats.\n\nIt is true that the Middle Ages in Ireland were not as well documented as those in Great Britain or Western Europe, and that this dearth of sources has affected the ways in which Irish history has been written and studied. But in recent decades, this situation has begun to change. Thanks to the painstaking work of historians, archaeologists, and other scholars, the history of medieval Ireland is slowly coming into focus. The story of medieval Ireland, a place of dynamic change and great achievement, is emerging from the mists of time, and it is a story well worth telling."}
{"text":"\n\nIn the Middle Ages, individuals with Down syndrome were often viewed as demonic. This cruel stereotype has its roots in the superstition that a Down syndrome birth was caused by the mother's having sex with the devil. In some cases, such beliefs led to the murder of children with the condition.\n\nIn the sixth century, the Catholic Church decreed that people with mental disabilities did not need to be baptized. Consequently, they could not go to heaven and were not eligible for burial in a churchyard. This ruling was based on the belief that people with Down syndrome had no soul. In the late 12th century, Pope Celestine III wrote a papal bull that allowed the burial of people with mental disabilities in churchyards, but only if they were baptized. The papal bull was prompted by public outrage over the treatment of people with disabilities.\n\nBefore the 20th century, there was no agreed-upon definition of autism. During the Middle Ages, autism was viewed as a mental or spiritual disorder, rather than a physical condition. People with autism were often described as having a \"divine madness\" or \"divine frenzy.\" They were believed to be possessed by the devil or by a demon, or to be an incarnation of the devil himself. This view of autism may have stemmed from the fact that people with autism often have difficulty communicating and interacting with others."}
{"text":"\nI'm not sure how expensive it would have been to live in an ancient city like Rome or Alexandria versus a smaller city, but I can say that it was very expensive to live in a modern city like New York or Tokyo. The main reason for this is the high cost of real estate. In a city like New York, the majority of people live in apartments or condos, and the cost of these can be very high. In addition, the cost of other necessities such as food and transportation can also be quite high. So, it's definitely true that living in a major ancient city would have been significantly more expensive than living in a smaller town or village."}

In his speech, he said, \"I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieve the goal, before the decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the Earth.\" \n\nKennedy's Republican opponent in the 1960 election, Richard Nixon, was also critical of the program. He argued that it was too expensive, and that the money would be better spent on domestic programs to fight poverty. In a 1962 speech, Nixon said, \"I do not believe that we can afford to expend billions of dollars on a single project, especially when we have so many needs here at home.\"\n\nSome politicians also questioned the scientific value of the Apollo program. In a 1967 speech, Democratic Senator William Proxmire of Wisconsin said, \"The United States is spending billions of dollars to send men to the moon. These billions of dollars could be better spent in helping people here on earth.\" Proxmire continued to oppose the program, and in 1971 he introduced a bill to cut funding for the Apollo missions. The bill was defeated, and the Apollo program continued.\n\nIn summary, in the 1960s, some U.S. politicians were opposed to the Apollo program, arguing that it was too expensive or that the money would be better spent on domestic programs.

{"text":"\n\nTo wage war, medieval armies required both strategy and good weather. Battles could not take place in the winter, when rivers and roads were frozen and snow made it difficult to move large numbers of men and materials. Also, medieval commanders preferred to attack enemy territory when the ground was dry. When rain turned the soil to mud, it could severely hamper an army's movements. For these reasons, medieval commanders planned their campaigns according to the weather. They also used weather as a weapon. In the ninth century, for example, the Byzantine emperor Nikephoros II Phokas allegedly used storms to destroy an Arab fleet.\n\nFor these reasons, medieval armies were very concerned with the weather. Commanders planned their battles around the seasons. They also tried to divine the future by consulting astrologers, who claimed to be able to predict the weather. In battle, generals tried to position their men in places where they would have the advantage. During sieges, they attempted to undermine the enemy's walls using tunnels. But bad weather could foil even the best-laid plans. Strong winds, for example, could fill the tunnels with debris, making them unusable. Rain and snow could also expose the location of the tunnels, ruining the element of surprise."}

{"text":"\nThe enslavement of Native Americans was practiced in North America for hundreds of years before the importation of enslaved Africans. Yet, while slavery was a dominant institution in the American South, it was almost unheard of among the hundreds of Native American nations in the East, Midwest, and West. What factors enabled some Native American societies to resist slavery while others did not?\n\nThere are a number of reasons that Native American societies were able to resist slavery. Some of these include: 1) Many Native American societies were not hierarchical or sedentary enough to support a system of slavery. 2) Some Native American societies had religious beliefs that were incompatible with the subjugation of one human being by another. 3) Native American societies were often small and isolated, which made it difficult for slave-traders to operate. 4) Native American societies often had effective means of dealing with criminals and outcasts, which reduced the need for slave labor.\n\nIt is worth noting that, despite the relative rarity of slavery among Native American societies, there were certainly instances of Native American slavery. In particular, the practice of enslaving enemy warriors was relatively common among many Native American societies.

One of the most popular is that it was a grand conspiracy by the auto industry to eliminate competition for cars.\n\nAs Snopes points out, the auto industry did have a strong interest in getting rid of streetcars, but that was because they competed with the industry, not because they wanted to eliminate a transportation alternative.\n\nAfter all, streetcars have made a comeback in recent years in cities like Portland, Oregon, and Atlanta, Georgia. But that doesn't mean the theories aren't fun to explore.

{"text":"\n\nThe antique doll is a staple of horror movie sets. But why do they often look so creepy? \n\nIn the 19th century, many people were terrified by the idea of a doll that appeared to be alive. This was in part due to the popularity of automata \u2013 machines that appeared to mimic human behaviour. \n\nThe Turk, for example, was a fake chess-playing machine created by Wolfgang von Kempelen in 1769. It consisted of a mechanical man dressed in Turkish robes and a turban, seated at a large cabinet with a chessboard on top. When the Turk was unveiled, people were amazed when it appeared to beat numerous human opponents. In reality, it had a human operator hidden inside. \n\nThe Turk's magic was debunked, but people remained fascinated by the idea of machines that appeared to think. This interest fed into the development of early dolls.\n\nOne of the first dolls to resemble a human was the 'mechanical baby' created by Jacques de Vaucanson in 1738. It could cry, drink, and even defecate.\n\nDe Vaucanson didn't intend for his creation to be a child substitute. Instead, he wanted to show how clever engineering could emulate human behaviour.\n\nYet the idea of a doll that could 'live' was disturbing. In his novel Frankenstein, Mary Shelley explores this fear. Victor Frankenstein creates a monster and is repulsed by what he has made.\n\nShelley's story, along with fairy tales like 'Little Thumb' and 'Pinocchio', cemented the idea of the doll as a symbol of childhood. A living, human-like doll would be a perversion of this.\n\nSo, why do antique dolls look so creepy? It's partly to do with expectations. A doll that moves, like the Turk, is fascinating. One that appears to have its own thoughts is unnerving."}
{"text":"\nAncient Romans had a variety of domestic tastes that evolved over time. In the first century BC, Roman homes were typically modest in size and decorated with simple furnishings. Over the course of the next several centuries, however, Roman homes became larger and more lavishly decorated.

Additionally, furniture and other domestic items became more ornate and luxurious.\n\nIt is worth noting that these changes in domestic tastes were not necessarily driven by decade-specific trends, but rather by broader social and economic changes. For example, the expansion of the Roman Empire brought new cultural influences into Roman society, which influenced the way Romans decorated their homes. Additionally, the rise of the wealthy upper class in Roman society led to an increased focus on luxury and status, which was reflected in the design and decoration of Roman homes."}

For example, in the early 1960s, the Soviet Union launched a limited-scale attack against Cuba, and in the late 1980s, the Soviet Union launched a large-scale attack against Afghanistan. In both cases, the Soviet Union was not able to achieve a quick and decisive victory."}
{"text":"\nDuring the early decades of the 20th century, many Southerners erected Confederate monuments as a way to commemorate their ancestors, maintain a sense of regional and racial pride, and perpetuate the myth of the Lost Cause. In addition, during the era of Jim Crow, Confederate monuments were often used to intimidate African Americans and legitimize white supremacy. As a result, many of these monuments were erected in the years following the end of Reconstruction, when Southern states were passing laws to enforce racial segregation and disenfranchise African Americans. The number of Confederate monuments peaked in the 1910s and 1920s, during the height of the Jim Crow era. Since then, many of these monuments have been removed, relocated, or contextualized in ways that provide historical perspective on the legacy of the Confederacy and the history of racism in the United States."}
{"text":"\nI never understood zeppelins in WWI. Why were they not really easy to shoot down? They are basically big bags of gas. It seems like it would be very easy to bring them down with a machine gun or a cannon.Historically speaking, Zeppelins were not very effective as weapons of war. They were used primarily for reconnaissance and bombing raids on military and civilian targets. While they were able to fly at high altitudes and were thus difficult to shoot down, their slow speed and lack of maneuverability made them easy targets for fighter planes. In addition, their hydrogen-filled hulls were highly flammable, and they were vulnerable to incendiary bullets and even small-arms fire. As a result, Zeppelins were eventually replaced by more effective aircraft, such as the B-29 Superfortress, during World War II."}

{"text":"\n\nIn the United States, especially the South, from the 17th century until the mid-20th century, the most common public toilets for African Americans were outdoor privies. These facilities were generally unhygienic and in poor condition, especially in urban areas. Black women were expected to dress modestly and not show their legs. Thus, they could not wear the shorter dresses that would have allowed them to use indoor toilets.\n\nSegregation of public facilities was a common feature of the Jim Crow laws, which were state and local laws in the United States that legalized racial segregation. The \"separate but equal\" doctrine was upheld by the Supreme Court of the United States in Plessy v. Ferguson (1896). Segregation of public facilities, and particularly transportation, was never truly \"separate but equal.\" Black people were expected to use the least desirable seats, accommodations, and facilities, and they were expected to use them at designated times. For example, blacks were expected to sit in the back of streetcars and to give up their seats if a white person wanted it. If they did not comply, they were subject to fines or arrest for failing to follow the law.\n\nDuring segregation, it was illegal for a white person to use a \"colored\" public toilet, and vice versa. If a white person used a \"colored\" toilet, he or she could be fined or arrested for breaking the law."}
{"text":"\nThe question of whether living standards improved or declined under Roman rule is one that has been debated by historians for centuries. On the one hand, the Romans brought a number of benefits to their conquered territories, such as improved infrastructure, better administration and governance, and access to a wider range of goods and services. On the other hand, the cost of Roman rule was often high, with taxes and other levies being imposed on the population, and the imposition of Roman law and culture on local traditions. Ultimately, the answer to this question will depend on the specific context and time period in question, as well as the perspective of the person making the assessment. In some cases, Roman rule may have improved living standards, while in others it may have had a negative impact. It is important to note that the experience of individuals under Roman rule varied greatly depending on their social and economic status, as well as their location within the empire. For example, those who were part of the ruling class or who lived in urban areas may have benefited from the presence of Rome, while those who were subject to heavy taxation or who lived in rural areas may have had a different experience. Ultimately, it is important to recognize that the impact of Roman rule on living standards was complex and multifaceted, and it is not possible to make a general statement about whether living standards improved or declined under Roman rule."}

Cartoonists had a field day with Taft's weight, depicting him as an elephant, a hippopotamus, and an overstuffed armchair. In fact, Taft was so large that he had special bathtubs installed in the White House to accommodate his size. The bathtubs were a source of great amusement to Taft's detractors, who made jokes about them whenever they could. Despite the jokes, Taft's weight was not a serious issue for most people. It was simply a fact of life that Taft was a large man, and people either accepted that fact or chose to make fun of it. Taft himself was not bothered by the jokes and took them in good humor.

{"text":"\nThe modern day paper sizes we know were first proposed in the 19th century. The German mathematician Georg Christoph Lichtenberg (1742-1799) is credited with the development of the Lichtenberg series of paper sizes. These are the ISO 216 paper sizes used today which includes A0, A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6, A7, A8, A9, A10. These were derived from the German customary 'Quire' (also known as 'Gruppe') which is the largest sheet made by a paper mill. This was then divided into 16 smaller sheets. The series of numbers that this method produced was then rounded to the nearest whole number, which explains why we ended up with an A4 size paper rather than A3.5. The German physicist and inventor, Otto von Guericke (1602-1686) created the first prototype of a machine to produce an endless sheet of paper. The paper produced was in the size of a watermelon.\n\nHowever, the story doesn't end there. The German papermaker and inventor, Johan Engebrand (1493-1550) proposed a method of sizing paper by using the poppy seed as the standard unit of measurement. He then divided the poppy seed into 24 equal parts. This resulted in a paper size of 9.5 x 14.1 inches, which was then cut into four equal sheets to produce a book size of 3.7 x 5.8 inches. This book size was then used as the standard for all books.\n\nThe paper produced was called the Engebrandt paper, or Engebrandt quire. It was used as the standard for all books until the 19th century. In the 19th century, the Engebrandt quire was gradually replaced by the Lichtenberg series of paper sizes. The Lichtenberg series of paper sizes was more popular because it was more practical and easier to use. The Lichtenberg series of paper sizes was also more suitable for the new printing presses that were being developed at that time.

Recent research by economist Miles Corak suggests that this belief is justified. He finds that the United States is indeed a land of opportunity, where it is possible to rise from one social class to another. In fact, the U.S. has had high rates of mobility throughout its history. It was true in the 19th century, when many European countries had only recently emerged from feudalism.

The first was to use more flexible infantry formations, such as the manipular system. This allowed the infantry to move more quickly, and change formations to match the situation. The second was to use more effective cavalry tactics. Instead of trying to directly counter the Parthian horsemen, the Romans began to use their own cavalry to harass the enemy, and to disrupt their attacks.

Trick-or-treating did not become popular until the 1950s, when it was invented as a way to keep kids from vandalizing their neighbors' houses on Halloween.\n\nThe reason we carve pumpkins on Halloween is that pumpkins were readily available in the fall. The reason we dress up as ghosts, goblins, and witches is that those were the most common costumes of the poor, who could not afford to buy more elaborate costumes.\n\nThe reason we have Halloween at all is that it was the last day of the Celtic year, and the Celts believed that the dead returned to walk the Earth on that day.\n\nIn the eighth century, Pope Gregory III moved the celebration of All Saints' Day from May to November 1. This was done partly to \"Christianize\" the pagan holiday of Samhain, but mostly to give the church more control over the pagan holidays that were already popular in the Roman Empire.\n\nThe same thing was done with Christmas, which was originally a pagan midwinter festival.

The word \"pagan\" comes from the Latin word for \"village,\" and it refers to the rural, agricultural roots of most early religions.\n\nThe Celts, who were the first to celebrate Samhain, were an agricultural people who depended on the sun and the seasons for their survival. They believed that the spirits of the dead returned to the Earth on Samhain, because it was the last day of the year.\n\nThe spirits of the dead were believed to be able to help the living, so the Celts would leave food and drink out for the spirits, and light candles to guide them to their homes.

But by AD361, Latin was the common language of the Roman Empire.\n\nIn AD361, you would have seen many differences between the Eastern and Western Roman Empires. The Eastern Roman Empire was much larger and wealthier than the Western Empire. The Western Empire was smaller and poorer. The Eastern Empire was very diverse, with people from many different cultures living there. The Western Empire was more homogeneous, with most people speaking Latin."}

In one of these stories, \"Abu al-Husn and His Slave-Girl Tawaddud,\" Abu al-Husn, who is a wealthy merchant, sends his slave-girl Tawaddud to Charlemagne's court with a letter and valuable gifts. When Tawaddud arrives at Charlemagne's court, she gives the gifts to the emperor and tells him of her master's great love for him. Charlemagne is so moved by this that he marries Tawaddud and elevates her to the rank of empress. When Tawaddud's ship returns to Baghdad, Abu al-Husn is filled with anger and resentment when he learns of his wife's actions. As a punishment, he has Tawaddud placed inside an iron cage and hung from the mast of his ship. The emperor of the Romans, however, is so grief-stricken by Tawaddud's death that he abdicates the throne and becomes a monk."}
{"text":"\nThe Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) embarked on a program of research into behavioral engineering, under the direction of Dr. Ewen Cameron. This research was called Project MKUltra. The experiments were intended to develop techniques for \"control of human behavior\". These experiments were conducted on a very large scale. Across 80 reported institutions, and many thousands of patients, how was there not even one whistle-blower? What eventually compelled the government to go public in 1975?\n\nThe details of the MKUltra experiments remain shrouded in secrecy. Many of the records are still classified. Those which have been released have been heavily redacted. The public has a right to know what was done in its name, by its government, and with its money. The experiments were highly unethical. They amount to torture. Patients were subjected to prolonged and severe sensory deprivation, as well as many other kinds of coercion and abuse.\n\nThe experiments began in the early 1950s. The CIA director at the time was Allen Dulles. He was a member of the Warren Commission, which investigated the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. The Warren Commission report, released in September 1964, concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald had acted alone. The report was widely discredited. It was noted that the Warren Commission had not interviewed key witnesses, including Sylvia Odio. \n\nOdio was a woman who had been present when Lee Harvey Oswald had visited her neighbor, Carlos Bringuier, in New Orleans in August 1963. Bringuier was the leader of the Cuban Student Directorate, a CIA-backed organization which had been training anti-Castro guerrillas. The Warren Commission did not interview Bringuier or Odio. They did not interview James Sergio Wilson, who had driven the car in which Oswald had arrived. They did not interview Bringuier's mother, who had also been present. The CIA had known about these witnesses. They had been planning to interview them. But they did not do so. The Warren Commission was a whitewash.\n\nIn 1975, John Marks wrote The Search for the Manchurian Candidate. It exposed the CIA's experiments in behavioral engineering. The book caused a scandal. It was followed by congressional hearings. The hearings revealed the full extent of the CIA's abuses. The CIA was compelled to release many of its records. These records showed that the CIA had been conducting experiments on a very large scale.\n\nThe records showed that the experiments had continued for many years. They had continued even after they had been exposed. The CIA had used many different institutions, to distance itself from the experiments. They had used hospitals and universities. They had used the United States Public Health Service. They had used the Army. They had used private institutions.\n\nThe CIA had used deception to maintain secrecy. They had used deception to prevent patients from discovering the true nature of the experiments. They had used deception to prevent patients from discovering that the experiments were being conducted with the full knowledge and support of the CIA. They had used deception to prevent patients from discovering that the experiments were being conducted with the full cooperation of the institutions in which they were being conducted.\n\nThe experiments had been conducted in secret. The patients had been deceived. They had been told that the experiments were being conducted for their own good. They had been told that the experiments were being conducted for the good of society. They had been told that the experiments were being conducted for the good of the United States. They had been told that the experiments were being conducted for the good of the world."}

But they were also expensive to purchase and maintain, and owning a horse was a sign of prestige and power. \n\nFor most of the 1700s, owning a horse or riding one on the job was a virtual necessity. In fact, as late as 1900, more Americans worked as horse-keepers, blacksmiths, or saddle makers than as automobile mechanics or car salesmen.\n\nDuring this time, horses were sometimes treated cruelly, especially by people who saw them as nothing more than a means of transportation. People sometimes forced horses to pull very heavy loads and drove them at breakneck speeds.

{"text":"\n\nThe Concorde was one of the most extraordinary technological achievements of the 20th century. It could cross the Atlantic in less than half the time of a conventional airliner, at twice the speed of sound. But the Anglo-French project was a commercial failure. Only 20 were ever built, and the last one retired in 2003.\n\nOne reason for its lack of popularity was the sonic boom the Concorde created when it broke the sound barrier. This meant that it could only fly supersonically over oceans - and even then, it could only maintain that incredible speed for around half an hour.\n\nAccording to urban legend, the Concorde's designers went to great lengths to hide its true performance from the Soviet Union. Allegedly, they fed the Soviets with deliberately flawed blueprints, which resulted in the Tupolev Tu-144 - the world's first supersonic airliner - being even worse than the Concorde.\n\nThis story is almost certainly untrue. The TU-144 was developed entirely separately, without any input from British or French engineers. It was also a far cruder design, using technology that was already obsolescent when the Concorde was first conceived. In fact, it was so bad that the Soviet Union only ever flew 12 production Tu-144s, all of them prototypes.\n\nThat said, there are similarities between the two aircraft. Both had similar maximum takeoff weights, and both featured a drooping nose, which was lowered during takeoff and landing to improve visibility. But beyond that, they were very different. The Concorde was a sleek, beautiful machine, built to the highest possible specifications. The Tu-144 was an ugly, rattling thing, whose only saving grace was that it could go a bit faster than the Concorde.\n\nSo no, the Concorde's designers didn't try to hoodwink the Soviets. They were simply too busy trying to make the best possible aircraft to worry about what the Soviets were doing."}

This was due in part to the fact that it was relatively inexpensive and easy to produce. It was also seen as less dangerous than some of the other options, as it was not necessarily fatal.

So why did the United States decide that Kokura was a more valuable target than Nagasaki?\n\nAt the time, Kokura was the site of a Japanese military arsenal and a significant naval base. It was home to major munitions factories and military machine shops, as well as the Kaiten Torpedo Storage Depot. It was a major port city with a population of over 400,000 people. And it was the headquarters of the Japanese Second General Army and the Imperial Japanese Navy.\n\nIn other words, Kokura was a major military and industrial center that was critical to Japan's war effort. It was also a significant port city that was home to a large number of civilians.\n\nNagasaki, on the other hand, was a smaller city with a population of about 250,000 people. It was not a major industrial or military center, and it did not play a significant role in Japan's war effort.\n\nSo why was Nagasaki chosen as a backup target?\n\nFirst, the weather over Kokura was too cloudy for the bomb to be dropped accurately. Second, the primary target was not attacked because it was found to be defended by more anti-aircraft guns and fighters than previously estimated. Finally, the secondary target was attacked because it was the only other city in the area that had not been previously bombed."}
{"text":"\n\nIn December 1954, McCarthy was finally brought to trial on charges of abuse of power. The trial didn't deal with his accusations about Communist infiltration of the Army, but with his actions against an Army dentist, Dr. Irving Peress. Peress had been accused of Communist sympathies by McCarthy, but was later cleared by a board of officers and re-instated. McCarthy was charged with abusing the powers of his office in the way he'd treated Peress. The trial was to be presided over by Senator Henry Cabot Lodge Jr., and the prosecution was led by the chief counsel of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, the job that Roy Cohn had coveted. This was a very public humiliation for McCarthy, who'd grown used to being in control. The hearings were televised, and the American public was able to see McCarthy lose control of the situation, and of himself.\n\nJoseph N. Welch, the Boston lawyer and Army colonel who'd been one of the main targets of McCarthy's attacks, was one of the first witnesses. He was followed by a parade of Army officers, including Peress. All of them were unfailingly polite and precise, and they calmly refuted all of McCarthy's charges. The hearings didn't deal with the big picture of McCarthy's campaign, but with the relatively small number of people he'd gone after. As each one of them was called to the stand, and was able to give a clear account of his life and career, the ridiculousness of McCarthy's campaign became obvious. The hearings didn't just expose McCarthy as a liar and a bully; they also showed him to be incompetent.\n\nThe trial dragged on for more than a month, and the hearings were broadcast every day. By the time it was over, McCarthy was a national joke. His name became an all-purpose adjective, \"McCarthyism,\" to describe wild, unfounded accusations. He was censured by the Senate, and his career was finished. He died of alcoholism less than three years later, at the age of 48."}

{"text":"\n\nThe origins of the crack cocaine epidemic can be traced back to the 1970s, when the CIA began to fund and arm the Nicaraguan Contras. The Contras were a group of anti-communist rebels who were fighting to overthrow the Sandinista government in Nicaragua. The CIA saw the Sandinistas as a threat to American interests in the region, and they wanted to see them ousted from power.\n\nIn order to fund the Contras, the CIA began to sell large quantities of cocaine to the black community in the United States. The agency did this in part to raise money for the Contras, but also because they believed that the crack epidemic would be a way to discredit the Sandinistas and destabilize their government.\n\nThe CIA's involvement in the crack cocaine epidemic has long been a source of controversy. Some people believe that the agency deliberately funneled the drug into inner city neighborhoods in the 1980s, causing a wave of addiction and violence that disproportionately affected the black community. Others argue that the CIA was simply trying to fund the Contras, and that the crack epidemic was a unintended consequence of their actions.\n\nThere is no definitive answer to this question, as the CIA has never publicly acknowledged its role in the crack cocaine epidemic. However, there is some evidence to suggest that the agency did play a role in the proliferation of crack cocaine in the United States. For example, a 1996 report by the CIA's own Inspector General found that the agency had \"engaged in drug trafficking and other criminal activities in order to generate revenue for the Contras.\"\n\nIn addition, a 2001 report by the National Academy of Sciences found that the CIA's \"support of drug trafficking by the Contras was a major factor in the development and expansion of the crack cocaine epidemic in Los Angeles.\"\n\nOverall, it seems that the CIA's involvement in the crack cocaine epidemic was more than just a urban legend.

One of the main points critics made was that the movie portrays the CIA as being directly involved in the Munich massacre at the 1972 Summer Olympics. However, the CIA was not involved in the planning or execution of the attack. Furthermore, the movie implies that the CIA protected Salameh from Israeli assassination attempts. This is also not true. Salameh was killed by Israeli commandos in 1979. The movie also implies that the CIA was involved in the planning of the attack on the Israeli Olympic team. This is also not true. The movie Munich is a work of fiction, and it should not be taken as a factual representation of the events that took place at the 1972 Summer Olympics."}
{"text":"\n\nIn the second world war, the main purpose of the sub-machine gun was to allow infantry to combat enemies in trench systems and urban environments. The close-quarters battle was one of the most important, and most dangerous, situations on the battlefield. The sub-machine gun was perfect for this. It could be fired from the hip or the shoulder, and its compact size made it easy to control in tight spaces. The sub-machine gun was also much cheaper than a rifle, and this made it more widely available to soldiers. This was very important in a war that was expected to be very costly.\n\nThe sub-machine gun was not a perfect weapon. It had a very limited range, and it was not very accurate. However, it was very effective at close range, and it was much easier to use than a rifle. It was the perfect weapon for the close-quarters battle."}
{"text":"\n\nThe Soviet Union is often described as having a \"middle class\" (by Western standards). In reality, the term \"middle class\" is not an accurate description of the Soviet social structure.\n\nIn the Soviet Union, there were two main classes: the working class and the intelligentsia. The working class included factory workers, farmers, and other manual laborers. The intelligentsia included doctors, engineers, teachers, and other professionals. The intelligentsia was the \"middle class\" by Western standards.\n\nHowever, the intelligentsia did not have the same level of material comfort and economic security as the middle class in the West. In addition, the intelligentsia was expected to support socialism and the Soviet system.\n\nThe working class, on the other hand, did not have the same level of education and cultural opportunities as the middle class in the West. In addition, the working class was not as supportive of the Soviet system as the intelligentsia."}
{"text":"\nAlexander the Great's talent and ambition were the primary reasons for his conquests. He was a skilled general and leader who inspired loyalty in his soldiers and drove them to achieve great things. He also had a strategic mind and was able to outmaneuver his opponents on the battlefield. Mehmet II was also a talented general who was able to take advantage of the disunity among the Byzantine Empire's rivals. He was also able to rely on a well-trained and disciplined army. Ranjit Singh's success was also due to his own talents. He was a skilled leader and organizer who was able to unify the various Sikh factions and lead them to victory against the Mughal Empire. He was also able to build a well-trained and disciplined army.\n\nIt is difficult to say how much of these conquerors' accomplishments were a result of their own talents and how much was due to other factors. It is clear that they all had some degree of talent and ambition, which were certainly important factors in their success. However, they also benefited from certain circumstances and the support of others. For example, Alexander the Great had the advantage of a well-trained and experienced army, as well as the support of his father, Philip II of Macedon. Mehmet II benefited from the disunity among the Byzantine Empire's rivals, while Ranjit Singh was able to unify the Sikhs and lead them to victory with the help of his advisors and generals. In conclusion, while these conquerors' talents and ambition were certainly important factors in their conquests, they also benefited from luck, circumstances, and the support of others."}
{"text":"\n\nThe short answer is: no one knows.  \n\nIf you think about it, it's impossible to know how frequently any mental illness occurred in the past, because people in the past didn't have our modern psychological vocabulary.  \n\nSo, even if we did have solid records from the middle ages or ancient Greece, no one would know how to interpret them.  \n\nAll we can do is look at modern hunter-gatherer societies, where people have pretty much the same psychology we do, and see how common mental illness is now.  \n\nAnd in modern societies, mental illness is very common.  \n\nFor example, in the United States, the National Institute of Mental Health estimates that in 2016,   about  one in five  adults  experience  mental illness  each year.  \n\nIf we take depression as an example, the World Health Organization estimates that \"... depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide, and is a major contributor to the overall global burden of disease.\" \n\nIn fact, by 2020, depression is projected to be the second leading contributor to the global burden of disease, after ischemic heart disease.  \n\nNow, all of these estimates are based on self-reported data, which is not always accurate, but there's no reason to think the real numbers are much different.  \n\nHunter-gatherers are, by definition, not very well-documented, but there's no reason to think that their rates of depression are any lower than ours.  \n\nIf anything, they may be higher, because they lack many of our modern sources of psychological comfort.  \n\nThe bottom line is, if you're looking for a time and place where depression was uncommon, the best evidence suggests that you should be looking at modern, wealthy, industrialized societies, not hunter-gatherers, or ancient Greece, or the middle ages."}

{"text":"\nThe Italian Army of World War II was infamous for its lack of effectiveness on the battlefield. Despite being one of the largest in the world, it was poorly trained, equipped, and led. In fact, it was so ineffective that it was responsible for the downfall of the Fascist regime in 1943. So, how bad was the Italian Army during World War II? Let's take a look. The Italian Army was first used in World War I, where it fought alongside the Allies. It was largely successful in this conflict, but the army was poorly prepared for World War II. The Italian Army had a lot of problems. Firstly, it was poorly trained. This was because the Italian government did not want to spend money on the military. Secondly, the Italian Army did not have many tanks or other modern weapons. Thirdly, the Italian Army was not very well organized. All of these problems meant that the Italian Army was not very effective in World War II. In fact, it was so ineffective that it was responsible for the downfall of the Fascist regime in 1943. The Italian Army was one of the largest in the world, but it was poorly trained, equipped, and led. It was so ineffective that it was responsible for the downfall of the Fascist regime in 1943."}
{"text":"\nEuropean Imperialism in Africa began in the fifteenth century when various European powers began establishing coastal trading posts and later missionaries arrived. In the late nineteenth century, with the so-called \"scramble for Africa\" in which European powers divided the continent between them, Imperialism was at its height. After World War II, the Imperial powers withdrew from their African colonies. The newly independent states were often ill-prepared for independence, lacking administrative skills and political experience. This led to instability, especially in countries where different ethnic groups were vying for power. The Imperial powers were often blamed for the instability that followed. However, it should be noted that instability often preceded Imperial rule and that other factors such as the Cold War and post-colonial conflicts were also to blame. European Imperialism played a significant role in the development of modern Africa, but it was not the sole cause of the continent's problems."}

{"text":"\n\nIn Norse mythology, the concept of the seidr (Old Norse: sei\u00f0r, \"magic\") is mostly associated with female practitioners. This is in line with a frequent gender dichotomy in Germanic mythology, where female beings are strongly connected to the concept of the fates.\n\nIn both the Poetic Edda and the Prose Edda, the Norns are described as being able to work magic. The v\u00f6lva (Norse: wise-woman) is a practitioner of seidr, and in the Poetic Edda poem V\u00f6lusp\u00e1 she is described as such:\n\nIn the Prose Edda book Gylfaginning, High-Father Odin (OH-din) himself consults a v\u00f6lva to find out who will be the next to die in the battle of Ragnar\u00f6k.\n\nThe v\u00f6lva's prophesies are backed up by the concept of the fylgjur (Norse: fylgja, \"that which accompanies\"), a supernatural creature that accompanies a person to serve them. In the Gylfaginning, High-Father Odin gives up one of his fylgjur to the v\u00f6lva in exchange for knowledge.\n\nIn the Poetic Edda poem Lokasenna, the v\u00f6lva is described as being able to \"work magic, and all kinds of witchcraft.\"\n\nThe concept of the v\u00f6lva appears in various other Old Norse texts. For example, in the Saga of the Volsungs, the v\u00f6lva Brynhild (BRIN-hild) is described as having the ability to see into the future.\n\nThe v\u00f6lva was a real profession in Viking Age Scandinavia. However, we don't know how these women were viewed by society. We know that they had knowledge that others did not, and they could have been seen as strange or even threatening.\n\nIt's also important to note that sei\u00f0r and the v\u00f6lva's role in society may have been more significant than what is presented in the written sources. The mythology may have downplayed the importance of the v\u00f6lva in order to minimize her power."}

The most popular today is Anno Domini, or AD, which places the year Jesus Christ was born (estimated between 6 BC and 4 BC) as year 1.\n\nMany people find it hard to accept that the Christian calendar began at what many regard as a mythical date, and prefer to start the count at a more 'historic' point. One suggestion, for example, is the accession of the Roman emperor Octavian Augustus, with year 1 being the year of his accession, which is usually given as 31 BC.\n\nAnother possibility is to start at the accession of the first emperor, Augustus's successor, Tiberius, in AD 14. There are other possibilities as well. For example, the French Republican calendar began in the middle of the French Revolution, with the year starting in what would have been the autumnal equinox of 1792.\n\nThe oldest continuous chronology that we have goes back to the accession of the Sumerian king Ur-Ninurta in the city of Lagash in southern Iraq around 2124 BC. The oldest historical event that can be dated with any certainty is the flood of the Sumerian city of Ur, around 3500 BC.\n\nMany ancient Egyptian dates are known, although we cannot be sure about their chronology. The best known is the date of the volcanic eruption on the Greek island of Thera, which was part of the Egyptian kingdom, and has been dated to around 1570 BC."}

How close were the three countries to war, and how was war avoided?\n\nThe naval arms race between Argentina, Brazil, and Chile was fueled by the desire of each country to assert its dominance over the other two. The competition was characterized by the rapid acquisition of modern warships and the construction of naval bases. The three countries were also involved in a series of diplomatic disputes, which further increased tensions.\n\nIn 1914, the outbreak of World War I led to a temporary pause in the naval arms race. However, once the war ended, the competition resumed. By the early 1920s, the three countries were once again locked in a race to acquire the most modern and powerful warships.\n\nIn 1926, Chile and Argentina nearly went to war over the use of the Beagle Channel. The two countries had long disputed the channel's ownership, and the dispute came to a head when Argentina attempted to impose restrictions on Chilean shipping. Chilean President Carlos Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez del Campo responded by ordering the Chilean navy to occupy the channel. However, after a series of diplomatic negotiations, the two countries reached a settlement, and war was averted.\n\nThe naval arms race between Argentina, Brazil, and Chile continued until the early 1930s.

The British knew this, and thus were keen to reach an accommodation with Germany to avoid such a fate. Operation Sea Lion was scheduled for the summer of 1940, but was postponed indefinitely following the German defeat in the Battle of Britain. The threat of invasion was used by British Prime Minister Winston Churchill to rally the British people and dissuade them from attempting to make a separate peace with Germany. Operation Sea Lion was never a serious possibility after the Battle of Britain, as the British would have been able to deploy significant land forces in the defense of Britain. However, the possibility of a German-occupied Britain did lead to Operation Unthinkable, which would have involved the bombing of German cities and a scorched earth policy had the Germans ever reached the outskirts of London."}

It was a very difficult time for the working class, and that's who the Sex Pistols appealed to. The same was true in New York City. The 1970s was the decade when the city began its long, slow decline. It was also when the city was on the verge of bankruptcy, and the infrastructure was crumbling. It was a very difficult time for New Yorkers, and the Ramones appealed to them in the same way the Sex Pistols did to people in the UK. Both groups were responding to the same things in the larger culture.\n\nThey were also responding to the same thing in the music industry. At the time, the popular music scene was dominated by prog rock, which was very self-indulgent and not very accessible. The Sex Pistols and the Ramones were both reacting against that.

{"text":"\n\nSaddam Hussein's Iraq was an authoritarian police state. Any form of dissent was ruthlessly suppressed, and the country was widely considered one of the most repressive regimes in the world.\n\nSo how was Saddam able to fight Iran for eight years (from 1980 to 1988) without a massive Shiite uprising in Iraq? After all, Iran was a Shiite majority country, while Iraq was ruled by a Sunni minority. Shouldn't Iraq's oppressed Shiite majority have risen up against Saddam?\n\nIn the 1970s, Iraq's Shiites were politically passive. The Shiite clergy was weak, and many Shiites were loyal to the Ba'ath Party. In fact, Saddam Hussein himself was a member of the minority Sunni sect, but he was able to rule over a politically quiescent Shiite majority.\n\nThis situation began to change in 1979, when Ayatollah Khomeini overthrew the Shah of Iran. Suddenly, Iraq's Shiites had a new role model in Khomeini, and many became inspired to rise up against Saddam. By the early 1980s, Khomeini's fiery anti-Western rhetoric had begun to resonate with Iraq's Shiites.\n\nThere were also economic and social factors at play. In the 1970s, Iraq's economy was booming, and many Iraqis of all ethnic and religious backgrounds (including Shiites) were able to enjoy newfound prosperity. But by the 1980s, Iraq was mired in a ruinous war with Iran. The Iraqi government's heavy spending on the war effort (including weapons purchases from the West) put a strain on the country's economy. And as the war dragged on, Iraq's formerly content population began to suffer from food shortages, power outages, and other hardships. These economic and social problems were felt most acutely by Iraq's Shiites, who were often excluded from power and were at the bottom of the country's social hierarchy.\n\nBy the late 1980s, Iraq's Shiites were ready to rise up against Saddam. In March of 1991, they finally got their chance. During the Shiite uprising of 1991, Saddam's government was overthrown, and he was forced to flee to exile.\n\nIn conclusion, Saddam Hussein was able to fight Iran for eight years without a massive Shiite uprising in Iraq because Iraq's Shiites were politically passive in the 1970s, and because the country's economic and social problems were most acutely felt by Iraq's Shiites."}

The idea that the world would last indefinitely was not yet current. When this didn't happen, the early church adjusted its message to account for this. There were various opinions on this matter, but the view that won out was that the world would end only with the Second Coming, which was a spiritual rather than physical event. So the idea was that the world would last indefinitely, and the church would grow and flourish until the Second Coming. This view allowed the church to expand well beyond the Jewish world, since the idea of a spiritual Second Coming didn't conflict with Greek or Roman ideas. It also gave the church a strong incentive to grow, since the larger it was, the closer it would be to the Second Coming. This view became predominant with the conversion of the Roman emperor Constantine, who commissioned the building of churches throughout the Roman Empire."}

{"text":"\nThe myth of the Soviet Union throwing waves of unarmed conscripts at Germany in WW2 originates from the views of many historians who analyzed Soviet casualties on the Eastern front of WW2 and came to the conclusion that the Soviets suffered much higher casualties than the Germans. This was largely attributed to the view that the Soviets were sending their soldiers to fight in unthinkable numbers and in a manner that was essentially self-destructive. Many Soviet sources (i.e. people who were there) refuted this claim, saying that the Germans suffered higher casualties, but that view did not seem to catch on in the West.\n\nThe reasons for this are complex, but one reason may have been the view that the Soviets did not value their own soldiers' lives. Another reason may have been a lack of sources in Russian, which limited the information available to historians. The fact that the Soviet Union did not allow for open discussion of their casualties until much later than other countries also did not help matters. Whatever the reason, the myth of the unarmed wave was perpetuated for decades, until historians such as David Glantz began to publish their findings and more information became available in Russian."}

Although most of its crew perished, a few, including da Nova, managed to reach the Chinese capital at Beijing, where they submitted to the emperor, Qianlong (r. 1736\u201395), and informed him of their discoveries in the New World. The emperor, who was already well aware of the Europeans, including the Spaniards, was not particularly impressed with the news. He is reported to have commented that the world was so vast that it was not surprising that the Spaniards had not yet been able to conquer it all.

{"text":"\n\nThe Golden Age of Piracy lasted for thirty years from 1690 to 1720 and made the reputation of pirates like Blackbeard, Captain Kidd, and Calico Jack. During the Golden Age of Piracy, conditions were ripe for the rise of pirates. The world was in a state of perpetual war, especially European powers like England, France, and Spain. At the same time, the world's first global trade network was taking shape. The increased trade meant more ships were needed to transport goods. These were often unprotected and therefore easy targets for pirates.\n\nPirate ships didn't have the firepower that naval ships had, so they resorted to ambushes and guerrilla warfare. They also had to be faster and more maneuverable than the ships they were attacking. These ships were typically smaller and cheaper to build, which meant that they could be built faster. It was also much easier to hide them in coves and small islands. The typical \"pirate ship\" was usually a modified merchant ship, which meant it had a low profile and could easily blend in with other ships.\n\nIn the late 17th century, the Caribbean was the most active area for pirates. The area was rich in Spanish treasure ships returning from the New World. The Spanish Main, which is the Spanish colonial territory in the Americas, was rich in gold, silver, and other treasures. In the Indian Ocean, the Dutch, English, and French East India Companies were all vying for trade dominance. As a result, ships were easy prey for pirates, and the potential rewards were high.\n\nA successful pirate could make a small fortune in a short time. In 1696, for example, the crew of the Fancy returned to Bristol with a treasure of over 50,000 pieces of eight. A year later, the same ship and crew captured a Spanish ship carrying 100,000 pieces of eight. In the early 18th century, pirate ships were said to earn up to \u00a31,000 a day. The most successful pirates could retire with a fortune of up to \u00a310,000.\n\nThe era of piracy lasted for about thirty years. In that time, it is said that the most successful pirates could amass a small fortune in stolen goods. But, realistically, how profitable was it to be a pirate?"}

{"text":"\nIn the beginning of the Cold War, Germany was divided into four sectors. The Soviet Union controlled the East, the United States, Britain, and France controlled the West. Berlin, Germany's capital city, was also divided into four sectors. In the beginning, the only way to travel between East and West Berlin was by passing through checkpoints. However, in the 1950s, the Soviet Union demanded that all rail, road, and water traffic between East and West Berlin be stopped. In response, the Western Allies created an airlift to deliver supplies to West Berlin. In 1961, the Soviet Union erected a wall to separate the two halves of Berlin. The Berlin Wall was a symbol of the Cold War. It divided not only a city but also a country and a continent. The wall stood for the division between East and West, democracy and communism, capitalism and socialism.\n\nIn the decades after World War II, many people in East Germany wanted to leave. The population of East Germany was much smaller than that of West Germany. In addition, the standard of living was lower in East Germany. Many young people wanted to leave because they were attracted by the West's freedom and consumer goods. The East German government tried to stop the population hemorrhage by raising the wall. The wall was a physical barrier that made it difficult for East Germans to leave. It also made it difficult for people in West Berlin to enter East Berlin. The wall was a potent symbol of the Cold War. It divided not only a city but also a country and a continent. The wall stood for the division between East and West, democracy and communism, capitalism and socialism."}
{"text":"\n\nThe first State of the Union Address was given by President George Washington on January 8, 1790, and the tradition continues to this day. Though many of the speeches are remembered for their grandeur and optimism, a few are more infamous for their awkwardness and controversy. Here are some of the most awkward, ridiculous, and controversial State of the Union addresses.\n\nPresident Ronald Reagan's 1986 State of the Union Address was memorable for all the wrong reasons. Just two weeks before the speech, the Space Shuttle Challenger exploded shortly after takeoff, killing all seven astronauts on board. Reagan's speechwriters had prepared a dramatic response to the tragedy, but the president decided to scrap it and speak extemporaneously. His decision to speak off the cuff resulted in a rambling, incoherent address that was widely panned by critics.\n\nIn 1994, President Bill Clinton delivered his first State of the Union Address after being sworn in for his second term. However, his speech was overshadowed by the recent death of White House Counsel Vincent Foster. Just days before the address, Foster was found dead of a gunshot wound in a Virginia park, sparking a public outcry and speculation about his death. Many believed that Foster's death was connected to the Whitewater scandal, and Clinton's speech was viewed as insensitive in light of the tragedy.\n\nPerhaps the most controversial State of the Union Address was given by President George W. Bush in 2003. Just weeks after the United States invaded Iraq, Bush used his speech to rally support for the war effort. However, his decision to deliver the address in front of a large banner that read \"Mission Accomplished\" was seen as premature and tone-deaf. The banner was later removed from the backdrop, but the damage had already been done."}

Despite a reward of $5 million and an offer of immunity, the artworks have never been recovered. Gardner's will specified that her collection could not be sold or transferred, but could be loaned to museums. Thus the thieves' only goal was to profit from the artworks' value, not their cultural value. Gardner's will also specified that if the collection were sold, the buyer would have to make it available for public viewing one day a week, free of charge.

Even if they made it to Saudi Arabia, they would often be refused entry and sent back.\n\nThe first legal Hajj took place in 1987, and was organized by the Soviet Union. It was not easy to get on this Hajj, and many people had to bribe officials to get a place. On the Hajj, there was one imam per 100 pilgrims, and the pilgrims were constantly surveilled to prevent any anti-Soviet demonstrations.\n\nAfter the fall of the Soviet Union, it was easier to go on the Hajj. However, there were still many logistical problems. Flights had to be chartered, and Saudi Arabia did not recognize the new passports.

{"text":"\nThe Arab slave trade is the slave trade of the Arab world. Slavery has existed in the Arab world since the times of the early Rashidun Caliphate (643-656 AD). At least a million people are believed to have been enslaved by Arabs between the 7th and 19th centuries. The majority of the slaves were likely to have been from Western Europe, Central Asia, South Asia, and Africa. According to some sources, a large proportion of the African slaves were from the Horn of Africa, including Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Somalia. \n\nThe trans-Saharan slave trade developed gradually over the course of the first millennium AD. At first, the main objects of this trade were gold, ivory, and other such luxury goods. Later on, with the emergence of the Trans-Saharan slave trade, people began to be trafficked as well. The expansion of the Islamic Empire across North Africa and into Europe, together with the emergence of the Swahili Coast as a major trading center, allowed for the further development of the slave trade. As the Swahili city-states grew rich on the slave trade, the region became increasingly Islamized.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, numerous Europeans were enslaved by the Arabs. Some were from places which were under Muslim rule, such as the Iberian Peninsula (al-Andalus). Others were from places which were not under Muslim rule, such as the Balkans, Hungary, and the Baltic states. Most of the slaves were captured in slave raids. However, some of them were convicted criminals.\n\nThe modern era of the Arab slave trade started in the early 16th century, when the Ottoman Empire began its expansion into Europe. As the empire grew, it started to import Christian slaves from Eastern Europe, as well as Russia. The number of slaves in the Ottoman Empire reached a peak during the 17th century. By the 19th century, the slave trade had largely been suppressed. The last country to officially abolish slavery was Saudi Arabia, in 1962.\n\nToday, there are no major ethnic groups in the Arab world which are descended from slaves. This is because the majority of the slaves were from other parts of the world, and were not settled in the Arab world."}

When the USSR offered to buy Cuban sugar at a much higher price than the US did, the Cubans felt that they had more in common with the Soviets than with the US. In addition, the Soviet Union was much more willing to sell weapons to Cuba. The US had refused to sell weapons to Cuba, but the Soviet Union sold Cuba many weapons."}
{"text":"\n\nIn World War I, the most common way for soldiers to kill each other was face to face at close range. A lot of soldiers were shot in the head, so the French and Germans both began wearing steel helmets. These helmets protected the soldiers' heads, but the French noticed that their soldiers were being shot in the face. They decided to add a visor to their helmets, which could also protect the soldier's face. The Germans thought the French idea was good, and also added a visor to their helmets. The British, however, decided to go with a different design. Instead of a visor, they decided to add a nose-piece, which would protect the soldier's nose.\n\nSo the British soldiers had a small strip of steel over their nose, while the French and Germans had a visor. The strip of steel was about the same size as a playing card, so soldiers started calling them \"card-stiffeners\". Of course, the card-stiffeners didn't actually stiffen the card. But soldiers were always playing cards, so they would often attach a playing card to their card-stiffener to hold it in place. And if they didn't have a playing card, they would use a piece of paper, or anything else they could find."}
{"text":"\n\nThe Russo-Japanese War was one of the first conflicts where a non-Western nation defeated a Western one. The Japanese victory shattered the myth of white racial superiority. This was a profound blow to the West. Japan's victory sent shockwaves through the world and forced Europe to re-evaluate its views on race and empire. In 1905, the Japanese also became the first modern non-Western nation to defeat a Western power. This achievement was not lost on other colonized peoples. The Russian Empire had been considered one of the great powers of the world for centuries. Its defeat by Japan was a huge blow to its prestige. The war also had far-reaching consequences for the Russian Revolution. Many of the socialists who would go on to found the Bolsheviks were inspired by the humiliating defeat. For Russia, the loss to Japan was a huge blow to national pride. The defeat shattered the notion of Russian military superiority. The loss of face in Europe was also considerable. The war showed that Russia was not the great power it had once been. In the eyes of many, Russia was now a second-rate nation. It would take Russia almost a century to recover from the blow to its prestige. The Japanese victory also gave them a great deal of respect in the West. The fact that a non-Western nation had defeated a Western one was seen as proof of Japan's strength. The war also gave Japan a great deal of confidence in its own abilities. It showed that Japan was a force to be reckoned with. The Japanese were now considered a military and economic equal to the great powers of Europe.

Roman artists strove to make their works look as realistic as possible, while Greek artists were more concerned with proportion and idealism. This is why Roman art, such as the paintings in the Villa of Mysteries, look more realistic than Greek art, such as the Parthenon Frieze. It is also why Roman artists, such as the famous Apelles, were renowned for their ability to create realistic portraits. While Roman art did not have the same level of artistic freedom as Greek art, it was still able to achieve a high level of realism and illusion through the use of perspective and shading."}
{"text":"\nThere is no word in Roman society for what we today associate with being on the autism spectrum. Autism was not recognized as a distinct condition in the Roman world. Autism spectrum disorder is a relatively new concept in the history of psychiatry, having only been introduced in the 20th century. The term autism was first used in the early 20th century to describe a specific disorder that was characterized by impaired social interaction, communication, and behavior.\n\nIn the Roman world, people with autism would have been diagnosed with a variety of different conditions depending on the specific symptoms they exhibited. For example, people with autism who had difficulty communicating and interacting with others may have been diagnosed with a condition such as aphasia, which is an inability to understand or express language. People with autism who exhibited repetitive behaviors and had a narrow range of interests may have been diagnosed with a condition such as monomania, which is an extreme fixation on a single subject.\n\nIn the Roman world, people with autism were generally treated with skepticism and fear. They were often seen as being possessed by demons or spirits, and were often shunned by society. There are also accounts of people with autism being killed or abandoned by their families."}
{"text":"\nThe AK rifle (AK-47, AKM, AK-74, etc.) is a gas-operated rifle that has a selector lever (selector lever - 1, 2, 3) that is supposed to allow either semi-automatic, fully automatic, or safe operation.\n\nAlthough the selector lever has three settings, the safe position, where the rifle will not fire, is the same as the fully automatic setting. If the selector lever is in the semi-automatic position, the rifle will only fire one shot per trigger pull. In the fully automatic setting, the rifle will continue to fire as long as the trigger is held down.\n\nSoviet doctrine for the AK rifle was that it was not to be used in the fully automatic mode unless engaging an enemy position. The reasoning was that full auto fire consumed ammunition too rapidly, and the short effective range of the AK rifle (compared to the bolt-action rifles) meant that most combat would take place at short range where full auto fire was not necessary.\n\nIn the event that the enemy was at medium or long range, or a vehicle was encountered, then the AK rifle was supposed to be switched to full auto and fired in short bursts. In fact, the safe and semi-auto settings were rarely used. The reasoning was that if the rifle was not in the ready-to-fire fully automatic mode, it would not be possible to bring it to bear on the enemy quickly enough."}

{"text":"\n\nThe heyday of summer camps can be traced back to the late 19th century. At this time, upper-class urban men began to spend time in the woods to escape the pressures of urban life and to rediscover their primal instincts. They brought this concept to the children of the elite, who had become soft and coddled in their comfortable lives. Summer camp provided a place where children could experience the outdoors, learn self-sufficiency, and develop character.\n\nIn the early 20th century, summer camps became more accessible to the general public. YMCA and YWCA camps provided a place for urban children to get out of the city and experience nature. The Boy Scouts of America and Girl Scouts of the USA also played a role in the rise of summer camps, as they provided structured activities and lessons in self-reliance for millions of children.\n\nThe popularity of summer camps peaked in the mid-20th century. During this time, many families were able to afford the luxury of sending their children to camp for a few weeks each summer. Summer camps became a rite of passage for many American children, and they were seen as a way to build character and independence.\n\nThe popularity of summer camps began to wane in the 1970s. With the rise of two-career families and the increased popularity of year-round sports, children had less time for traditional summer camp activities. In addition, the counterculture of the 1960s had brought about a shift in values, and many people began to see summer camps as too regimented and not in line with the new values of freedom and self-expression.\n\nToday, summer camps still exist, but they are not as popular as they once were. Many families cannot afford the cost of sending their children to camp, and those who can often choose more specialized programs that focus on specific interests, such as sports or the arts. However, the concept of summer camp remains an important part of the American childhood experience, and it continues to provide children with valuable opportunities for growth and development."}
{"text":"\n\nGuy Mollet, Prime Minister of France from July 2 to September 8, 1956, proposed to Elizabeth II, then only 25, that she become \"Queen of the United Kingdom of France\". He was making a reference to the centuries-long rivalry between England and France, hoping that the young Queen, who was only 25 at the time, would accept to unify the two states.\n\nHis proposition was as follows:\n\n\"The French Government is ready to start negotiations with the British Government with a view to an eventual fusion of the two countries. The unification must be a fusion, not a conquest. The Queen of England, descendant of William the Conqueror, would become Queen of the United Kingdom of France. The British Empire would be preserved, as well as the British nationality and the English language. The capital would be Paris. The French fleur-de-lis flag would fly alongside the Union Jack. The pound sterling and the French franc would be replaced by a new currency called the franc.\"\n\nMollet's proposition was a part of a speech he made at the French National Assembly on July 2, 1956, and was greeted with laughter. The Prime Minister was trying to appeal to British public opinion and encourage the United Kingdom to enter the European Economic Community, which was created on March 25, 1957. Mollet was hoping that the UK would join the community and thus prevent the UK from trying to re-establish its hegemony over the Commonwealth.\n\nMollet's proposition was extremely unrealistic. For one thing, the United Kingdom had just emerged victorious in the Second World War, and it was unlikely that it would voluntarily give up its hard-won international status and allow France to take the lead in Europe. Also, the UK had a long history of rivalry with France, and it was unlikely that the two countries would be able to overcome their differences and unite. Finally, the UK had a much larger population than France, and it was unlikely that the French would be willing to give up their own culture and language in favor of English.\n\nIn conclusion, Guy Mollet's proposition to Elizabeth II was unrealistic and was not taken seriously by the British government. It was only a part of a speech that was made in the context of trying to encourage the UK to join the European Economic Community."}

In fact, there were several such groups, and the participants were not all children. The most famous group left Europe in 1212, led by a charismatic French peasant named Stephen. According to legend, he believed that the sea would part before them, allowing them to walk to Jerusalem. Stephen was followed by a much larger group of 30,000, many of whom likely died of hunger and disease on the way. The surviving members of the group were sold into slavery in Egypt or North Africa.\n\nIn fact, there were several groups of children who set off to join the crusades. In the early 12th century, the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick Barbarossa sent an army to the Holy Land. However, most of the soldiers were killed in battle or died of disease. In response, Pope Innocent III preached a series of sermons to rouse the faithful to join the fight. In his sermons, the Pope made a plea to the children, asking them to join the fight. This likely inspired a number of children to set off on their own, many of whom were never heard from again.\n\nThe Children's Crusade became a popular legend in the Middle Ages. It was recounted in books and plays, and it inspired many artists. In the 19th century, it was even suggested that the Children's Crusade was the origin of the legend of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. However, there is no evidence to support this theory.\n\nThe Children's Crusade was a real event that was later mythologized. It was a tragedy, in which many children lost their lives. But it was also a testament to the power of faith, as these young people were willing to give up everything to join the fight for the Holy Land."}

John Kennedy wanted Robert to have a significant role in the administration, but he was concerned that appointing him to a high-level position might create the impression that he was engaging in nepotism. Robert Kennedy had served as John Kennedy's campaign manager in the 1960 election, and there was talk that he would be named Secretary of State. However, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which would have to approve any Secretary of State, was concerned that he was too young and inexperienced for such a critical position.  Ultimately, Robert Kennedy was named Attorney General, a position that required Senate confirmation, but which was considered less controversial.\n\nWhen John F. Kennedy was assassinated in November 1963, many people expected that Robert would not seek the Presidency in 1964.  However, Robert Kennedy was very much a part of the decision-making process in the Johnson Administration, and he became a candidate for the Presidency.  The prospect of a President Kennedy caused considerable concern, especially among conservatives, who viewed him as too liberal and inexperienced.  The editors of the National Review even wrote an article opposing his candidacy.  When he was assassinated in June 1968, the editors wrote another article expressing their \"shock and grief\" at his death, but adding, \"We have no wish to gloat, and we deeply mourn his death. But we do not have to pretend, as so many do, that we are deeply grieved by the prospect of his being President. We are not.\"\n\nRobert Kennedy's selection as Attorney General received only modest attention when it was announced.  However, after John Kennedy was assassinated, there was considerable discussion of his performance as Attorney General.  One editorial that appeared shortly after the assassination noted that Robert Kennedy \"developed an outstanding reputation as attorney general.  He made a genuine and highly effective effort to rid the country of the menace of organized crime.\"  A retrospective article in the New York Times Magazine in December 1966 noted that Robert Kennedy \"was the best attorney general this country has had in 20 years, and perhaps the best it ever had.\""}
{"text":"\n\nBuddhism, particularly the Mahayana tradition, is generally considered to be a religion of peace and non-violence. As such, how did Buddhist-majority nations reconcile state violence (wars and so on) with Buddhist precepts of non-violence? Did they bother to do so?\n\nIn many Buddhist countries, such as Japan and Thailand, the sangha (monastic community) has been responsible for the transmission of Buddhism, including its values and ethical guidelines. However, the monastic community has also played a significant role in justifying and supporting the state's use of violence. During the 8th century, Japanese monks compiled a set of laws known as the Ritsury\u014d, which justified the use of violence and revenge as a means of maintaining social order. In the 14th century, Thai monks developed a similar set of laws called the Dhammap\u0101tha, which also justified the use of violence and revenge in the pursuit of justice.\n\nIn addition to justifying state violence, Buddhist monks have also been directly involved in the practice of violence. During the 18th century, Thai monks were involved in the violent struggle for control of the throne. During the 19th century, Japanese monks were involved in the military campaigns of the Meiji government. In the 20th century, Vietnamese monks were involved in the struggle for independence from France.\n\nIt is clear that Buddhist-majority nations have had to reconcile state violence with Buddhist precepts of non-violence. In some cases, such as Japan and Thailand, the monastic community has played a significant role in justifying and supporting the state's use of violence. In other cases, such as Vietnam, the monastic community has been directly involved in the practice of violence. It is important to note that the role of the sangha in justifying and supporting state violence is not unique to Buddhist-majority nations. In many Western countries, such as the United States, the Catholic Church has also played a similar role."}

It was a tool used by the Catholic Church to root out heresy, blasphemy, and other forms of religious nonconformity. The Inquisition was feared by many people, including those who were not necessarily guilty of anything. The threat of being accused of heresy was enough to make people keep their mouths shut and go along with the Church. For those who were truly guilty of religious crimes, the Inquisition was a terrifying prospect. Those who were found guilty of heresy were subject to harsh punishments, such as being burned at the stake.\n\nDespite the fear that the Inquisition instilled in people, it was not without its critics. Some people believed that the Inquisition was too harsh and that it did not always act in a just manner. There were also those who questioned the Inquisition's effectiveness in rooting out heresy.

{"text":"\nBeef has been part of the Japanese diet since the second century, when cattle were introduced via China and Korea. However, it was not until 1872, with the opening of Japan to the West, that beef consumption became popular. Today, Japan is the largest consumer of beef in Asia, and the Japanese consume more than 3.9 million tons of beef and beef products every year. Of that, more than 800,000 tons is imported from the United States. In fact, the Japanese eat so much beef that Japan is the largest importer of American beef. The most popular cut of beef is a filet of beef, followed by short ribs and sukiyaki.\n\nThe cattle breeds used in Japan are mostly Japanese Black, Japanese Brown, and Japanese Shorthorn. The most popular breed is the Japanese Black, known for its high quality, tenderness, and flavor. The beef produced in Japan is heavily influenced by the practices and methods of raising cattle. For example, the animals are raised on small farms with limited space, which results in the animals having to move around more. This movement results in the meat having a higher level of marbling, which gives it a more tender and flavorful texture. In addition, the animals are fed a diet that is high in rice straw and other forage, which also contributes to the quality of the meat.\n\nThe combination of these factors results in beef that is not only tender and flavorful, but also well-marbled and extremely high quality. This has led to Japan being known for producing some of the best beef in the world."}

Over time, different Native American societies developed different ways of life and technologies to adapt to their environments. In what is now the southwestern United States, for instance, people built irrigation systems and large cities. In the plains, people used bows and arrows. In the Arctic, they fished and hunted whales. When Europeans arrived, they brought diseases that killed many Native Americans. But some Native American societies were able to resist European colonization. Others, like the Creek and the Seminole, adopted some aspects of European culture. Many Native American societies continue to thrive and develop in the 21st century."}

Part of the reason for this is that they were not as involved in the conquest and colonization of the Americas as the other empires. However, they did have some knowledge of the Americas, and there are a few Ottoman maps of the Americas.\n\nThe Ottomans first began to have a comprehensive understanding of the \"New World\" in the 16th century. This was around the same time that they began to establish diplomatic ties with North and South American nations. The first Ottoman map of the Americas was created in 1513 by Piri Reis. This map showed the coast of South America, the Caribbean, and the east coast of North America.\n\nIn 1529, the Ottoman Empire established diplomatic ties with the Aztec Empire.

{"text":"\n\nVoting rights in the United States have expanded and contracted over time, often in response to social and political changes. Prior to the American Revolution, only white male property owners could vote. In the years leading up to the Civil War, some black men were able to vote, and after the war, the 15th Amendment guaranteed the right to vote could not be denied based on race. Women did not win the right to vote until the passage of the 19th Amendment in 1920. Native Americans were explicitly denied the right to vote until the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924, although some states allowed Native Americans to vote. Chinese immigrants were able to become citizens and vote beginning in 1943. \n\nAfter World War II, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 aimed to overcome legal barriers at the state and local level that had prevented African Americans from exercising their right to vote under the 15th Amendment. The Voting Rights Act has been amended multiple times, including in 1970, 1975, and 1982, to expand its protections. In 2013, the Supreme Court struck down a key provision of the Voting Rights Act, which had determined which states and localities must receive federal approval for voting changes. The court found that the formula used to determine which states were subject to the provision was outdated. Critics of the decision warned that it would lead to a rollback of voting rights. In 2018, the Voting Rights Advancement Act was introduced in Congress to update the Voting Rights Act and re-establish the federal preclearance requirement for states with a recent history of voting discrimination.\n\nRegistration was not required in early elections, and in many states, it was not until the turn of the 20th century that officials began requiring eligible voters to register. In some states, such as Oregon, women were able to vote before they were required to register. Although registration is not required to exercise many of our other rights, such as the right to free speech, proponents of registration laws argue that they are necessary to prevent fraud and ensure that only eligible voters are able to cast a ballot. In many states, voter registration is now available at the same time as driver's license applications. Critics of voter registration laws argue that they disproportionately burden low-income and minority voters. In the 2018 midterm elections, 17 states had new restrictions in place, including strict voter ID laws and registration deadlines as close as the day of the election."}
{"text":"\n\nIn the late nineteenth century, the United States embarked on an ambitious plan to expand its influence in the Caribbean and Pacific. The Spanish-American War, which lasted from April to August of 1898, was a direct outgrowth of this desire for expansion. Spain, which had once controlled much of the Americas, had been reduced to a second-rate power by the late nineteenth century. The United States, on the other hand, was a rising power and was eager to establish itself as a major player in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nThe Spanish-American War began when the United States, under the leadership of President William McKinley, demanded that Spain give up control of Cuba. The United States was also interested in acquiring the Philippines, a Spanish colony, and Puerto Rico, a Spanish protectorate. The war was fought primarily in Cuba, the Philippines, and Puerto Rico, and it resulted in the defeat of the Spanish forces and the acquisition of these territories by the United States. The Spanish-American War was a major turning point in the history of the United States. It marked the end of Spain's once-great empire and the beginning of the United States' rise to prominence in the Western Hemisphere."}
{"text":"\nIn Chinese music theory, the traditional division of the octave is into 5 notes, with do re mi fa sol placed in the order of the solf\u00e8ge system. This is different from the division of the octave into 12 semitones used in Western music theory. The traditional Chinese system is based on the discovery of the harmonic series.\n\nIn the Chinese system, the octave is divided into two fifths. The interval between C and G is therefore called a diapason (or diapason normal), and the interval between C and G sharp or G flat is called a diapason d'amalgam (or diapason chromatique). Thus, the octave is divided into five diapasons, and the whole scale consists of the 12 notes of the chromatic scale plus five additional notes, the \"diapason harmoniques\".\n\nThis theory is based on the discovery of the harmonic series, which was known to the ancient Chinese. The 12 notes of the chromatic scale correspond to the overtones of a fundamental tone, while the five additional notes correspond to the undertones.\n\nThe ancient Chinese believed that there were only five notes because they thought that the harmonic series only went up to five notes. This is related to pentatonics in that the pentatonic scale is based on the five notes of the harmonic series. However, the pentatonic scale is not limited to the five notes of the harmonic series, and can include other notes as well."}

{"text":"\nIt is important to remember that the Anglo-Saxons were still in the process of becoming a unified England. Alfred's Wessex was one of the more powerful kingdoms, but it was not the only kingdom. There were still Danish (Viking) kingdoms in the north and east, and the native Britons were trying to maintain their independence. Communication between the different kingdoms was limited.\n\nIn the late 9th century, the only people who regularly traveled between England and the rest of Europe were the Vikings. The Anglo-Saxons were still a couple of centuries away from developing a merchant class, and their economy was based on the production of food and other goods for their own use. The Vikings were the main link between England and the rest of Europe, and they were the ones who brought the new ideas and technologies to England.\n\nThe Vikings were also the main threat to Alfred's Wessex. They had already conquered the north and east of England, and they were constantly attacking Wessex. Alfred's strategy was to try to keep the Vikings away from Wessex by negotiating with them and paying them off. This is why we don't see any interaction between Alfred and continental Europe. He was too busy trying to defend his own kingdom."}

The Victorians were so fixated on this moment that they actually changed the calendar: 1867 was declared the official year in which all Britons became adults at the age of 21.

{"text":"\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, the U.S. considered using nuclear weapons. The main reason for this was to prevent a defeat. One of the most controversial aspects of the war was the fact that the U.S. was losing. In order to change the course of the war, the U.S. considered dropping a nuke. In 1965, the U.S. started sending troops to South Vietnam. By the time they left, over a million troops had been sent. However, the U.S. was not able to stop the spread of communism. This was a major blow to American prestige. At the time, the U.S. had a nuclear monopoly. The Soviet Union did not get nuclear weapons until 1949. The U.S. was not able to use this advantage during the war. The U.S. was afraid that if it used nuclear weapons, the Soviet Union would retaliate. This would have started a nuclear war."}
{"text":"\n\nThe ideological divide between younger and older voters in the United States has narrowed somewhat since the 1990s, but there is still a meaningful difference in voting behavior between the two groups. Since 1972, younger voters have voted more liberally than older voters. \n\nIn that year, voters under the age of 30 supported Democratic presidential candidate George McGovern by a margin of 13 percentage points, while voters over the age of 65 supported Republican candidate Richard Nixon by a margin of 49 percentage points.\n\nIn recent presidential elections, the difference in voting behavior between younger and older voters has been about 10 to 15 percentage points. In 2020, for example, Joe Biden received about 45% of the vote among voters under the age of 45, compared with about 33% among voters over the age of 65.\n\nThe divergence in voting behavior between younger and older voters has sometimes been attributed to differences in education levels. In recent decades, younger voters have been much more likely to have a college degree than older voters. However, other factors, such as race and ethnicity, gender, and religion, have also played a role in driving the ideological divide between younger and older voters. For example, in recent elections, younger voters have been more likely to support progressive candidates, such as Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, while older voters have been more likely to support more moderate candidates, such as Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton."}

{"text":"\nThe idea of perpetual prayers seems to have been more common among the laity than the clergy. Although some of the Church fathers, like St. Jerome and St. Gregory the Great, did make such provisions in their wills, they were exceptions. It was usually the wealthy laity who could afford to endow perpetual prayers, and their provisions were sometimes very specific.\n\nA bequest of 1133, for example, provided for perpetual prayers for the soul of the donor, his wife, and their children. The prayers were to be said by two monks in the church of St. Mary of Blachernae in Constantinople, where the donor's bones were to be buried. The monks were to be paid from the proceeds of a house that the donor had earlier given to the church. If the house was sold, an inn was to be purchased with the money and the monks were to be paid from the income of the inn. The donor also provided for two lamps to be kept burning perpetually in front of the church in honor of his family.\n\nMany of the perpetual prayers established by laity in the Middle Ages are still being said today. The prayers for King Ine of Wessex, who died in the early tenth century, are still said in Winchester Cathedral. A monk named Ealdwulf, who died around the year 1000, established perpetual prayers in the church of St. Mary in the New Minster at Winchester. The prayers were to be said for the soul of Ealdwulf and for the king and the people of Wessex.\n\nIt is not surprising that prayers established by the laity a millennium ago are still being said. Prayers for the dead are, after all, a normal part of the Church's ministry, and a bequest that provided for perpetual prayers was a way of ensuring that one's soul would be prayed for in perpetuity."}

{"text":"\nThe Swiss flag is square because it is derived from the shield of the 13th century Count of Savoy. The original flag was a square banner of the count, but later it was changed to the white cross on a red background. In the late 15th century, the Swiss confederacy began to use this flag as its own. The flag was modified slightly in 1815, when the modern version of the Swiss flag was adopted. The Vatican flag is also square, and it has a very similar design to the Swiss flag. This is because the two states had a common ancestor in the Holy Roman Empire. The Empire used a white cross on a red background as its flag, and this design was later adopted by the states that would become Switzerland and the Vatican. The Swiss flag is unique among sovereign flags in that it is the only one that is square. It is also one of the few sovereign flags that does not feature the national colors of the country. Instead, it uses the colors of the Count of Savoy, which were white and red. The Vatican flag is also square, and it shares the same design as the Swiss flag. The two states have a common ancestor in the Holy Roman Empire, and they both use the white cross on a red background as their flag."}

The link between obesity and wealth was also noted. Fat people were associated with privilege and power. They could afford to eat more, and they did not need to do physical labor.\n\nThe link between eating more and putting on weight was first noted in the scientific community in the 1800s. In the second half of the nineteenth century, the spread of obesity was considered to be a significant social problem. An obese person was thought to be lazy, slovenly, and lacking in self-control. The medical profession was not overly concerned about the health risks associated with obesity.\n\nThe idea that eating more makes you fat was not common knowledge. It was simply not something that most people thought about. They were more concerned with putting food on the table than with the idea that eating more could make you fat. It was only in the 20th century that this idea began to gain currency. This was due in part to the spread of the idea that being fat was unhealthy. People began to realize that being fat was not simply a matter of aesthetics, but also of health."}

This system was set up to ensure that no one person would have too much power. The F\u00fchrer was supposed to be elected by the Party, but in practice, he was chosen by the army and the Cabinet.

The cities they founded were laid out on a grid, with streets at right angles to each other. The most prestigious neighborhoods were those farthest from the center of town. As the cities grew, the wealthy fled to the outlying neighborhoods. Today, the center of Boston, for example, is not a wealthy neighborhood, but the center of the financial district, which empties out after work.

A northwest passage would connect the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans across the northern part of North America (around or above Canada). For centuries, European explorers tried to find a northwest passage from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean. The idea of a northwest passage was first suggested by the Greek astronomer Pytheas in the 4th century B.C. He claimed to have visited a frozen sea, possibly in the Arctic Ocean. Pytheas's account was dismissed by other Greek and Roman writers, who believed the world was divided into two continents, Asia and Europe, separated by an ocean.\n\nFor centuries, European merchants looked for a shorter, faster route to Asia to trade for valuable goods such as silk, spices, and gems. Christopher Columbus made four voyages across the Atlantic in search of a westward route to Asia. In 1519, the Spanish explorer Ferdinand Magellan became the first to sail from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean. However, his expedition was a struggle against starvation, scurvy, and storms, and more than half the men were lost. Nevertheless, Magellan's expedition proved that an ocean connected the two halves of the world.\n\nEuropean explorers believed a northwest passage would offer a faster, safer route to Asia. In 1534, King Henry VIII of England sent explorer Jacques Cartier to the New World in search of a northwest passage. Cartier took two voyages along the St. Lawrence River, but he was unable to find the way through. In 1610, Henry Hudson, an English explorer working for the Dutch East India Company, tried to find a northwest passage from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean. Hudson navigated along the river that would later be named for him, but he was unable to go any farther. Hudson was supposed to search for the northwest passage from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean. However, he got distracted by the more lucrative prospects of finding a shorter route to Asia by going north along the North American coast. He sailed into a bay on the eastern coast of Canada, which was later named for him.\n\nHudson believed that the Hudson Bay would provide a short cut to Asia. In 1611, he set sail with a crew of ten men in the 80-ton Halve Maen (Half Moon). Hudson made it to the vast inland sea that would later be named after him. He sailed along the southern and western shores, but he could not find a way out. Hudson was forced to overwinter on the frozen sea. When the ice began to break up in the spring, he sailed west, but he could not find a way through. He turned back and sailed along the northern shore, but he still could not find a way out.\n\nHudson and his crew were trapped in the ice for months. By the time they were able to return to England, it was 1612. They had been away for more than a year. Hudson was convinced that he had found the northwest passage, but he was unable to convince his patrons. In 1614, Hudson made a second attempt to find the northwest passage. This time, he sailed to the north, but he was again unable to find a way through. In 1616, Hudson made a third attempt. This time, he sailed to the south, but he was again unable to find a way through.\n\nEuropean explorers continued to search for a northwest passage for centuries, losing many ships and crews in the process. Those who returned had been marooned for months or even years in the ice. Despite all evidence to the contrary, Europeans continued to believe that an open water route existed somewhere. The idea of a northwest passage was finally put to rest in 1850, when the British explorer Sir John Franklin and his crew disappeared while searching for the passage. Their ships were later discovered, trapped in the ice, along with the remains of the crew. The ships and crew were recovered in 2014 and 2016, respectively."}

These claims were never substantiated or repudiated. It is worth noting that Iraq's claims were not without merit. Kuwait had indeed been slant drilling, and Iraq had legitimate grievances against Kuwait. However, Iraq's decision to invade and annex Kuwait was not justified, and was a clear violation of international law."}

The UK today is counted amongst the top nations of the world economically, but what was the state of the UK in the 1970s? What was the affect of having to ask for such a huge loan? The UK economy was in a mess in the 1970s, with inflation out of control and industrial unrest aplenty. In fact, a Conservative government under Edward Heath was forced to introduce a three-day working week to conserve electricity. The miners' strike of 1972 had led to power cuts and the three-day week was an attempt to conserve energy. However, it was deeply unpopular and was only ended after the Conservatives lost the February 1974 election to Harold Wilson's Labour government. The Conservatives remained in opposition until the next election in October 1974, when Labour was re-elected with a tiny majority. The new government was soon beset with problems, including the so-called \"Barber boom\", high inflation and industrial unrest. By 1976 the country was in such a mess that it had to ask the IMF for a loan of nearly $17 billion. The IMF insisted on a number of tough measures to curb inflation, including a \"pay pause\" and cuts in public spending. The loan was repaid in full in 1988."}

Even when she emerged from mourning, she continued to wear black for the rest of her life and limited her public appearances. For widows of the middle class, the end of the mourning period marked the beginning of a new life. Victorian society expected middle-class widows to remarry.

{"text":"\n\nIn many ways, World War II was a boon for the United States and the other Allied powers, but the war exacted a terrible price from the losers. The Soviet Union lost an estimated 26 million people, China around 6 million, and Japan around 2 million.\n\nOn the other side of the ledger, the United States lost around 405,000 service members. Many more were wounded or taken prisoner. While these losses were certainly tragic, the United States emerged from the war as the dominant economic and military power in the world.\n\nOther countries that participated in the war, including Britain, France, and Germany, also made it through the war with their economies intact, and their political systems essentially unscathed. The same was true of countries in the Allied camp that were not directly involved in the fighting, such as South America's largest nation, Brazil.\n\nIn contrast, the countries that fought against the Allies, including Germany, Italy, and Japan, were devastated. The infrastructure of these countries was shattered, and their economies were in ruins. The same was true of the countries allied with Germany and Japan, such as Romania and Bulgaria.\n\nSo, while the Allied powers emerged from the war with their economies intact, the same was not true of the Axis powers and their allies.

In fact, they could sometimes be downright counterproductive. For example, if the Beserker went berserk too early, they could end up charging into the enemy lines before the rest of the army was ready, causing confusion and disorder. And if the Beserker went berserk too late, they could end up charging into a well-defended enemy line, only to be cut down by the waiting soldiers.\n\nIn short, Beserkers were effective in battle, but only if they were used correctly.

{"text":"\n\nIn 1964, at the age of 22, he won the world heavyweight championship, defeating Sonny Liston in a major upset. In the same year, he denounced his birth name, Cassius Marcellus Clay, as a \"slave name,\" and formally changed his name to Muhammad Ali. He cited his religious beliefs as the primary motivation for the change, and said that he did not want to be associated with a \"white man's name\" (Clay was the name of a 19th-century Kentucky abolitionist). As a result of his conversion to Islam, he took the name Muhammad Ali, which he said meant \"one who is worthy of all praises.\" However, he was also inspired by the Nation of Islam leader Elijah Muhammad, who gave him the name. In contrast to Malcolm X, who had left the Nation of Islam, Ali remained a member until the death of Elijah Muhammad in 1975.\n\nIn 1967, Ali refused to be conscripted into the U.S. military, citing his religious beliefs and opposition to the Vietnam War. As a result, he was stripped of his title and convicted of draft evasion. He was not sentenced to prison, but did not fight again for nearly four years while his appeal worked its way through the court system. During this time, he was widely vilified in the media as a traitor to his country and a coward. In 1970, the New York State Supreme Court cleared Ali of the charges, citing the U.S. Supreme Court's recent decision in the case of Jack Johnson. The high court had overturned Johnson's conviction on the grounds that the government had violated his First Amendment rights. The same logic applied to Ali, the New York State court ruled.\n\nAli's comeback fight was against Jerry Quarry in October 1970. By this time, he had become a symbol of the anti-war movement. The three-year layoff from boxing had affected his skills, and he lost the match in the third round. He fought nine more times before finally regaining the world heavyweight title by defeating George Foreman in the famous \"Rumble in the Jungle\" match in Kinshasa, Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo) in October 1974. Foreman had been the undefeated heavyweight champion, and many observers considered Ali an underdog. The fight, in which Ali used his now-famous \"rope-a-dope\" strategy, was watched by a record-breaking audience of 1 billion viewers worldwide."}

{"text":"\nDuring the middle ages, the mounted knight was the most prestigious warrior in all of Europe. He was the ultimate combination of strength, training, and equipment. At the peak of their effectiveness, knights were the finest heavy cavalry in the world. Their job was to charge forward, break enemy lines, and then pursue the enemy. This task would often involve charging directly into the ranks of a disorganized infantry. While it is true that a single knight was not invincible, he was definitely a match for a dozen or so infantry. Knights were trained in the use of lances, swords, and battleaxes. They were also quite formidable archers. Furthermore, their heavy armor made them largely immune to arrows and primitive hand weapons. It would be very difficult for a dozen infantry to take down a mounted knight. Even if they were able to successfully wound the knight, it would take many more than a dozen to actually bring him down. If the infantry were able to somehow manage to take down the knight, they would have to deal with his warhorse. Warhorses were very expensive and well trained. They were capable of charging through a group of infantry and wreaking havoc."}

{"text":"\n\nAfter World War II, the American economy grew spectacularly, and the union movement grew right along with it. In just two decades, union membership in America went from 9.9 percent of the workforce in 1947 to 24.2 percent in 1973.\n\nThe collapse of union membership since the 1970s has been well-documented. Today, just 6.4 percent of American workers are in unions, a far cry from the glory days of the mid-20th century. But why did the labor movement decline?\n\nThe biggest reason for the decline of the labor movement is the decline of American industry. Unions were strongest in America's industrial sector, particularly in the auto and steel industries. As these industries have shed jobs, so have union members. And as manufacturing jobs have migrated overseas, it has become harder for unions to organize workers.\n\nThe decline of American industry has led to a decline in manufacturing jobs. Between 1979 and 2013, the U.S. economy lost approximately 7 million manufacturing jobs. And even though manufacturing output has grown substantially over the last several decades, the number of people employed in the manufacturing industry has fallen. In the 1950s, around 25 percent of American workers were employed in manufacturing; today that number is less than 10 percent.\n\nOther factors contributing to the decline of the labor movement include the anti-union animus of Republican presidents like Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump, the changing nature of work (which makes it difficult to unionize workers who are not employed in a traditional workplace), and the fact that younger workers are less likely to view unions favorably."}

The attack killed 2,403 Americans and injured 1,178. The Japanese losses were less: 29 planes, five midget submarines, and fewer than 100 men.\n\nHowever, the attack on Pearl Harbor was not the beginning of the war between Japan and the United States. Tensions had been growing between the two countries for more than a decade, fueled by Japanese aggression in China and the Pacific. The United States had placed an oil embargo on Japan in July 1941, after Japan invaded French Indochina (now Vietnam). The embargo meant that Japan could not import American oil. Without oil, the Japanese economy would grind to a halt. The United States demanded that Japan withdraw from China and Indochina and end its support for the Axis powers (Germany and Italy). Japan refused to back down. The two countries moved closer to war.\n\nThe Japanese had gambled that they could win a quick war against the United States. They were wrong.

The real question is: Why did it take so long? In the year 1350, the mayor of Piacenza, Italy, instituted a law requiring all cooks to boil their food. He was onto something. In 1527, the physician Paracelsus wrote that \"all diseases are purged with boiled water.\" And yet it would be more than 300 years before anyone figured out why this was true. Even Louis Pasteur, who is rightly credited with the discovery of pasteurization, didn't realize that heat killed microbes. His famous swan-neck flask experiment showed that if you boiled a broth and sealed it, nothing bad would happen. But he didn't realize that it was the boiling that kept the broth safe. It wasn't until the turn of the 20th century that scientists finally began to understand the relationship between microbes and disease.\n\nIt wasn't for lack of scientific inquiry. Between 1200 and 1850, there were plenty of major scientific advances. Philosophers, inventors, and scientists were beginning to understand magnetism, inventing the microscope, and grappling with the laws of gravity. But no one put two and two together when it came to boiling water and disease.\n\nProper sanitation and hygiene weren't even a consideration until the mid-1800s, so boiling water wasn't really a thing.

{"text":"\n\nOn August 2, 1937, the U.S. Congress passed the Marihuana Tax Act which placed a tax on the sale of cannabis and other drugs. The act was proposed by Representative Robert L. Doughton of North Carolina, and was based on the findings of the 1937 Federal Bureau of Narcotics Marijuana Tax Act hearings. The act was signed into law by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The law was the first to criminalize the possession of cannabis, and also mandated that cannabis and hemp be registered and subjected to the 1937 Federal Marihuana Tax. The act effectively outlawed the non-industrial production of hemp.\n\nAccording to a leading cannabis law reform advocate, \"The original impetus for the bill was to raise revenue from marijuana users and sellers, not to control the drug.\" In a report to Congress, Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau, Jr. stated that the purpose of the bill was not to curb use, but to keep drug users from going to prison. \"It is proposed,\" he said, \"to give the Department of Justice the power to regulate by registration persons who cultivate marihuana for non-medicinal use. The Department of Justice, through its agents, is given authority to enforce the Act by seizing the plants of those who cultivate the drug in excess of the amount that can be registered. This method of control is preferred to that of criminalizing possession, which would impose upon the Department of Justice the tremendous burden of apprehending and trying a great number of persons, the vast majority of whom would be non-criminals. Criminalization of possession would also seriously impede the work of the Department of Justice in combating organized criminal gangs. The Department of Justice believes that a program of registration is the most practical means of control. Under such a program, the Department of Justice would be enabled to regulate the cultivation of the drug by those who are required to register, to apportion the amount that they may lawfully cultivate, and to eliminate surreptitious cultivation by those not required to register. The Department of Justice would also be enabled to confiscate all crops grown in excess of the amount lawfully allotted to a cultivator.\n\nIt is recognized that registration will not of itself completely stamp out the illicit traffic, but it is believed that such a program, coupled with stringent enforcement of the penal provisions of the bill, will have a salutary effect upon the persons who use the drug and will tend to diminish the use of the drug by those persons who use it simply because it is obtainable."}

{"text":"\n\nChurchill's electoral defeat in 1945 was not just a personal setback; it marked the end of an era in British history. For the first time in nearly 20 years, the Conservative Party was out of power. It was not just Churchill who had led Britain to victory; the Labour Party had played its part. Clement Attlee, who replaced Churchill as prime minister, was the man who had organized the home front during the war. \nThe public was ready for change, and they were eager to rebuild their lives after the war. The Labour Party had promised a welfare state and national health care. The people believed that only Labour could deliver on these promises. \nChurchill was 75 years old when the elections were held. He was not in good health and was not prepared to lead his party into another election. He had become a symbol of the past, and the public was ready for a new start."}
{"text":"\nHitler's lifestyle in Vienna was very modest. He was dependent on the charity of others and his room was sparsely furnished. However, he did have enough money to afford to become a regular at Caf\u00e9 Central, where the rich and famous of Vienna would meet. This shows that he was not as poor as his lifestyle in Vienna might have suggested. It is also worth noting that Caf\u00e9 Central was not particularly expensive, and it was a place where people from all walks of life could afford to go."}
{"text":"\nThe weapons you mention (catapults, ballistae, trebuchets) were used in sieges for a variety of purposes. Their primary use was to attack the enemy forces defending the city or castle, whether that meant raining down destruction on the defenders or breaking down the walls. But they were also used to attack the civilian population in the city or castle. This would have been done in order to wear down the defenders, as well as to punish the civilian population for their resistance. In some cases, these weapons were also used to destroy the city or castle itself, either as a means of punishment or in order to make it more difficult for the defenders to hold out. In short, the weapons you mention were used in a variety of ways in ancient and medieval sieges, depending on the specific circumstances of the siege and the goals of the attackers."}
{"text":"\n\nIn December 1938, the Japanese government issued the \"Twenty-One Demands\" to the Chinese government. One of the demands was that Japan be given control of the area around the South Manchuria Railway, which was heavily populated by ethnic Japanese. Another demand insisted that Japan be given extraterritorial rights in China, meaning that Japanese citizens would be subject to Japanese law, not Chinese law. Many in the United States opposed these demands, but the United States stayed neutral during the conflict. On July 7, 1937, the Marco Polo Bridge Incident occurred near Beijing, China. This marked the beginning of the Second Sino-Japanese War, which later became part of World War II. The Japanese quickly overran Chinese military forces in the region, capturing the Chinese capital of Nanking in December 1937. In the spring of 1938, Japanese forces moved into the Yangtze River Valley, reaching Wuhan by the end of that year. By the time the Chinese Nationalist government retreated to Chongqing, it controlled only a small part of southwestern China.\n\nIn Europe, the Japanese signed the Anti-Comintern Pact with Germany on November 25, 1936. The pact was directed at the Soviet Union and called for both parties to oppose communism. Japan and Germany viewed the Soviet Union as a major threat and hoped to avoid a two-front war by cooperating with each other. On September 27, 1940, the Tripartite Pact was signed by Germany, Italy, and Japan. The main purpose of the Tripartite Pact was to deter the United States from interfering in the European and Asian conflicts. The three countries also agreed to aid each other in the event of an attack by a nation not involved in the pact. This alliance became known as the Rome-Berlin-Tokyo Axis."}
{"text":"\nIn the Scottish Highlands of the 1500s, clans were the basis of society. If your clan was defeated, it meant that you no longer had the protection of your chief. You would have to find another clan to take you in. This was not always easy, and many people were left homeless and destitute. Some clans were more powerful than others, and a defeat could mean a significant change in your quality of life. It was not unheard of for people to starve to death or freeze to death in the winter. The Scottish Highlands were a harsh place, even for those who were protected by a clan."}
{"text":"\nIn the UK, rationing of many foods began in January 1940 and tea was rationed in July 1940. The first ration books gave everyone a weekly allowance of 8oz of meat, 1.5 pints of milk, 2.5 pints of beans and 4oz of cheese, together with 2oz of butter and margarine and an allowance of sugar. It was thought that this would be enough for health, but the Ministry of Food was soon concerned that it was not enough for pleasure, so some meat and fats were added to the ration in 1942. Householders were issued with two ration books, one for 'solid' foods and one for 'liquids', which included milk, cheese, butter and margarine.\n\nThe meat ration was just one ounce per person per week, which was not enough for most people. The cheese ration was increased to two ounces, but many complained that this was not enough for people who worked on farms or in factories.\n\nMany foods were not rationed, but supplies were limited. Most fruits and vegetables were in short supply, and it was difficult to get hold of white bread, cakes, biscuits, and confectionery.\n\nChocolate was not rationed, but it was in short supply. This was because most of the cocoa beans used to make chocolate came from Africa and South America. These countries were cut off from the UK by the Battle of the Atlantic, and so the supply of cocoa beans was limited.\n\nAmerican soldiers were not subject to rationing, and they had more money to spend on food than British soldiers. This meant that they were able to eat better than British soldiers."}
{"text":"\n\nThe cheerleader outfit is a classic piece of American sportswear, but how did it come to be? The cheerleader outfit was created in the late 1800s by a man named Thomas G. Morris. He was a physical education teacher at a college in New Jersey. He wanted to create a uniform for his students that would be both comfortable and attractive. He chose a short skirt and a white blouse with a bow. He also chose to have the students wear white knee-high socks and black shoes. The students loved the new uniform and it became a tradition at the college. From there, the cheerleader outfit spread to other colleges and high schools across the country. It became a symbol of American cheerleading and a way for teams to show their school spirit. The cheerleader outfit has changed a lot over the years. The length of the skirt has gotten shorter and the socks have gotten longer. But the basic elements of the uniform have remained the same. The cheerleader outfit is a classic piece of American sportswear that has stood the test of time."}
{"text":"\nEarly humans had poor dental hygiene. They did not brush their teeth and likely had cavities. In addition to cavities, their teeth were also likely stained from their diet. Cavities and tooth decay were likely a big problem for early humans. They would have dealt with the pain from cavities by using natural remedies. These could have included things like chewing on herbs or using a toothache plant. These remedies would have helped to numb the pain. However, they would not have been able to fix the cavities. Early humans did not live long enough for cavities to be a major issue. Their average lifespan was only about 30 years. This was shorter than the lifespan of modern humans. The reason for this is that they had a much more physically demanding lifestyle. They also did not have access to modern healthcare."}
{"text":"\nThe Roman Empire's economy was regulated by the government. The government imposed taxes on the people and businesses. It also set prices for goods and services. The government used its power to ensure that trade was fair and that everyone was paid what they were owed. The government also controlled the money supply. The regulators did not have to study economics in school first. They used their own experience and knowledge to regulate the economy."}
{"text":"\n\nThe distinction between yams and other crops as \"men's crops\" and other crops as \"women's crops\" in Things Fall Apart has to do with how the crops are cultivated and processed. Yam cultivation is extremely labor intensive. In the first place, yams are planted in ridges in a clearing made in the forest, so the process of clearing the forest and making the ridges is very physically demanding work. In addition, yams need to be periodically replanted, which involves cutting them into pieces and planting the eye (the part from which the shoots emerge when the yam is replanted) in the soil. This process is also very labor intensive. Finally, yams are harvested during the rainy season, which means that they have to be carried out of the village and stored in sheds. All of this labor is performed exclusively by men. The same is true of cassava, which is also very labor intensive to grow, and of coco-yam, which is planted and harvested in a similar way. Beans, on the other hand, are less labor intensive. They are planted in the rainy season, so they do not have to be carried to a shed. In addition, their leaves and shoots are harvested and eaten, so the beans do not have to be replanted. Since women do most of the cooking in traditional Igbo society, they are the ones primarily responsible for harvesting the leaves and shoots of the beans. Thus, while men are responsible for yams, cassava, and coco-yam, women are responsible for beans."}
{"text":"\n\nIn the mid-16th century, Ivan IV (the Terrible) of Russia, looking to expand his country's boundaries and secure its frontiers with the Mongols to the south, began a campaign to annex the Siberian Khanate, a collection of semi-independent states in the region's eastern reaches. This vast area stretched from the Urals to the Pacific Ocean and north to the Arctic, and it was home to a diverse array of indigenous groups, including Mongolic-speaking Buryats and Tuvans, Turkic-speaking Sakha, and Paleosiberian speakers such as the Koryaks, Evenks, and Chukchi. After more than a century of intermittent warfare, in 1648 the Russian Empire established its dominion over the Khanate of Sibir, opening the region to the waves of Russian and other European migrants who would transform its demographics and culture. The conquest of Siberia was a pivotal development in Russian history, enabling the later Russian Empire to emerge as a major power in the 18th century and, ultimately, to expand across the globe."}
{"text":"\nThe discovery of the Americas by Columbus was a seminal moment in world history, and it had a significant impact on the Muslim world. In general, the Muslim world was skeptical of Columbus's claims and did not believe that he had truly discovered a new continent. Some scholars even suggested that Columbus had not actually reached the Americas, but rather had voyaged to a different part of the world.\n\nIn terms of colonization, the Muslim world did not attempt to establish colonies in the Americas. This was in part due to the fact that the Americas were not seen as a particularly desirable place to live, given the harsh climate and the lack of resources. Additionally, the Muslim world was already stretched thin in terms of its resources and manpower, and it was not in a position to launch a major colonization effort in the Americas.\n\nIn terms of bringing the Quran to the Americas, there is no evidence that this was ever a goal of the Muslim world. The primary focus of the Muslim world was on spreading the message of Islam and establishing the Islamic faith in the Middle East, North Africa, and other parts of the world. The Americas were simply not a priority for the Muslim world, and they were not actively sought out as a place to bring the Quran."}
{"text":"\n\nConstantinople was founded in AD 330 by Emperor Constantine the Great as the capital of the Roman Empire. Though the city was known as the \"New Rome,\" it was not the center of the Roman Empire. It was, however, the center of the Eastern Roman or Byzantine Empire that carried on the traditions of Roman culture. For this reason, the Greeks continued to refer to themselves as Romans for centuries after the fall of the Western Roman Empire. The last Roman Emperor in the West, Romulus Augustulus, was deposed in AD 476 by the Germanic leader Odoacer. After that, the Eastern Roman Empire carried on the Roman legacy in the East. The Eastern Roman or Byzantine Empire did not fall until 1453, when Constantinople was conquered by the Ottoman Turks. The last Byzantine Emperor, Constantine XI, died in battle defending the city. At that point, the use of the term \"Roman\" in reference to Greece ceased.\n\nIn modern times, the term \"Roman\" is generally used to refer to citizens or culture of the Italian peninsula. The Greeks, who have their own distinct culture and are not ethnically Italian, are instead referred to as \"Hellenes.\""}
{"text":"\n\nDuring the life of Jesus, Judea, part of the Roman Empire, was a theocracy, a type of government in which the religious leaders also govern. The Jewish people were subjects of the Roman Empire but were allowed to practice their own religion and customs. The Jewish people believed in one God, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and they followed the laws set forth in the Old Testament of the Bible. The Jewish people lived in Judea, in the area known as Palestine. Jesus was a Jew who was born in Bethlehem, a town in Judea.\n\nJesus began his adult life as a carpenter in Nazareth, a town in Galilee. He was baptized by John the Baptist, a Jewish prophet, in the River Jordan. At the age of 30, Jesus began his public ministry as a preacher and healer. He gathered 12 followers and began to travel and preach throughout Judea. He preached that people should love one another and that everyone was equal in the eyes of God. He also performed miracles, such as curing the sick and the disabled, and he raised people from the dead.\n\nJesus became very popular with the people, and the Roman authorities became concerned that he might try to take over the government. Finally, Jesus was arrested and crucified, or killed, by the Romans. His followers believed that he rose from the dead and that he is the son of God. Today, Jesus is a central figure in Christianity, a religion that has over 2 billion followers around the world."}
{"text":"\nThe Catalans and the Valencians both speak a dialect of Catalan, which is a Romance language. However, the Valencian dialect is slightly different from the Catalan dialect, and there is a strong sense of Valencian identity that is separate from Catalan identity. In fact, the Valencian dialect is so different from the Catalan dialect that it is often considered to be a separate language.\n\nThere are a few reasons why the Valencians may not have had a similar experience to the Catalans in terms of ethnic distinctness within Spain. Firstly, the Valencian region has a long history of autonomy, and the Valencians have maintained their own unique culture and traditions. Secondly, the Valencians have generally been more accepting of Spanish identity than the Catalans, who have often felt a stronger sense of ethnic distinctness. Finally, the Valencian region is more geographically and culturally diverse than the Catalan region, and this has contributed to a stronger sense of Valencian identity."}
{"text":"\n\nMedieval armies had several ways of telling which side a soldier was on. These included the prominent display of heraldic devices on shields, surcoats, and banners. Some soldiers also wore a distinct uniform. Knights were often given special coats of arms, and the tradition of heraldry was continued by many other military leaders. In addition, commanders often had their soldiers wear a specific symbol on their clothing. This could be a badge, a piece of cloth, or even a distinctive type of boot.\n\nHowever, in the heat of battle, these methods were not always enough to prevent friendly fire. The din of clashing swords and shields, the dust and confusion, and the distance between the lines could easily confuse soldiers. To make matters worse, many opposing armies had similar uniforms and heraldic devices. In fact, the heraldic device of the English royal family, the lion, was also used by the Welsh and the Scottish. Thus, it is not surprising that some soldiers were killed by their own side. \n\nIn fact, a thirteenth-century chronicler wrote that King Henry III once almost killed his own son, Edward, at the Battle of Lewes in 1264. In the heat of the moment, Henry mistook the prince's standard, which displayed the royal arms of England and France, for that of the enemy. Fortunately, Henry was able to recognize his mistake before he ordered his men to attack.\n\nWhile instances of friendly fire were certainly not common, they did occur. It was not uncommon for soldiers to mistake their own side for the enemy, especially in the heat of battle."}
{"text":"\n\nThe Spartans were perhaps the most famous ancient warriors, renowned for their almost superhuman strength and fitness. Like all soldiers of the time, they would have had to be in excellent physical condition to fight effectively, especially since they often went into battle with little more than a shield.\n\nTo prepare for battle, they would undergo a strict regime of diet and exercise. Spartan men were expected to be in peak physical condition, and were required to take part in regular physical exercise, including wrestling. Along with their diet of grains and vegetables, this would have ensured that they were strong and fit.\n\nSoldiers of the Roman Empire also had to be in good physical condition, and were expected to march for 20 miles in full armor, at a pace of around 5 miles per hour. They also had to be strong enough to wield the heavy weapons of the time, such as ballistae and catapults.\n\nTo maintain their strength and fitness, soldiers would have had a diet rich in protein, and would have taken part in regular physical exercise. This would have included strength training, such as lifting weights and practicing with weapons, as well as more general exercises, such as running and swimming."}
{"text":"\n\nDuring the Islamic Golden Age, especially in the 9th century, when the Caliphate of Cordoba in Spain (al-Andalus) was at its height, the society was relatively open and women could move relatively freely, work, own property, and even attain high office. Many women in al-Andalus received a formal education, which was largely limited to religious subjects. Some of them became famous scholars in their own right, such as the 10th-century female poet Wallada bint al-Mustakfi.\n\nThere were, however, some limitations on women's rights. They could inherit only half as much as their male siblings, they had to be virgins when they married, and widows had to wait for a certain period of time before they could remarry. Women could not serve as witnesses in court. There was also the matter of the veil, which became widespread in the 11th century. This practice was criticized by some, such as the Andalusian poet Ibn Hazm (d. 1064).\n\nWomen in the Islamic East were also able to attain considerable rights, although, in general, their status varied according to time and place. Women in the medieval Fatimid Caliphate, for example, had access to education and some women attained high office. In contrast, women in the medieval Sunni Ottoman Empire had very limited rights and there was a strict segregation of the sexes."}
{"text":"\n\nIn Roman society, music was an integral part of their daily lives. Romans used music in religious ceremonies, to boost morale in battle, and as a form of entertainment. Music was so important that they even had special musicians who were responsible for providing the music for these occasions. The instruments used by the Romans included horns, flutes, and lyres. The music of the Roman Empire had a significant influence on the development of Western music.\n\nUnfortunately, we don't know exactly what ancient Roman music sounded like because it was largely passed down orally. The Romans didn't have a system of notation like we do today, so the only way to learn a piece was to hear it and practice it over and over. This means that even if we did have the original sheet music, we probably wouldn't be able to play it correctly anyway. However, we can make some educated guesses based on the instruments they had and the types of music they enjoyed. For example, we know that they loved to dance, so it's safe to assume that their music had a strong rhythm. They also had a fondness for the lyre, which was a popular instrument in ancient Greece.\n\nOverall, ancient Roman music was probably very similar to the music of ancient Greece. It was probably quite elegant and sophisticated, with a focus on melody and rhythm."}
{"text":"\n\nIt is hard to overstate the influence the Roman army had on Roman society and culture. The army was the single largest organization in the Roman world, and its organization, equipment, and tactics were widely imitated. It was also the single largest consumer of goods and services produced in the Roman economy.\n\nRoman soldiers served for 20 years. However, after serving their first five years, they were given a discharge with a bonus. This was usually enough to set them up in a trade or as small shopkeepers. If they chose to re-enlist, they served for another 15 years. After that, they were given a pension and were expected to leave the army. Some chose to stay in the army, but they were only allowed to do so if they rose through the ranks to become officers.\n\nThe Roman army was structured in such a way that it could be quickly expanded in times of crisis or war. To do this, it needed to be able to rely on a constant supply of trained and experienced soldiers. This need for a constant supply of soldiers is one of the reasons why the Roman army was so large.\n\nDuring the Roman Republic, legionaries were not given leave to visit their families. However, there were occasions when a legion was sent to a different part of the empire for a campaign and was away from its home base for years at a time. In such cases, the soldiers were allowed to marry and start families while on campaign. When the campaign was over, the soldiers were given a period of leave to go back to their families.\n\nDuring the Roman Empire, the situation changed somewhat. Soldiers were still not given leave to visit their families, but they were allowed to marry and start families while on campaign. When the campaign was over, they were given a period of leave to go back to their families.\n\nIn both the Republic and the Empire, soldiers who deserted while on leave were subject to severe punishment. Under the Republic, deserters were crucified. Under the Empire, they were either crucified or beheaded."}

They associated marijuana with Mexicans and were afraid that the drug would be used to promote sedition against the U.S. Government. That's why the U.S. passed the Marijuana Tax Act in 1937.

The farthing was worth a quarter of a penny, and was first minted in England in the 13th century under King John. It was minted in silver, and so was in circulation for a long time. The last farthings were minted in 1956, and so the coin was still legal tender when it was decimalised."}
{"text":"\n\nAs long as there have been historians, people have complained about them. Usually, the complaints are about bias: \"history is written by the winners\" is a cliche for a reason. But another common complaint, dating back at least to the Roman Empire, is that history is written by the literate. In other words, history's authorship has typically been the exclusive province of the educated elite. In the Roman era, this was a relatively small group of people, most of them (but not all) men, who were either soldiers or members of the imperial administration. For most of the rest of history, literacy has been even more restricted. It's been limited to small groups of people who had the time and money to get an education. In other words, history has been written by a tiny, privileged minority. And that's led some people to complain that history is biased because it's written by the literate. If history is always written by the few, goes the argument, it will necessarily reflect the biases and interests of that small group. And that means it won't be an accurate or objective representation of the past. But is that actually true? Is history necessarily biased because it's written by the literate? It's certainly true that historians have their biases and blind spots. But it's also true that they can be aware of those biases and try to compensate for them. And the fact that history has been written by the literate doesn't necessarily mean it's biased. It just means that it's been written by a select group of people. And that group of people is likely to have its own set of biases and interests. But those biases and interests aren't necessarily the same as those of the general population."}
{"text":"\n\nWhile the Great Leap Forward resulted in a massive famine that killed tens of millions of people, the Communist Party of China has always insisted that the campaign was a success. It claims that the famine was due to natural disasters and blames the deaths of millions of people on counterrevolutionaries and \"class enemies\" who supposedly ate grain and hid it. In order to support this narrative, the government has enforced an official campaign of historical negationism that erases the Great Leap Forward from the historical record and criminalizes discussion of the campaign's negative effects.\n\nThe Great Leap Forward had some successes. For example, the steel produced in backyard blast furnaces during the campaign did have some military value. Also, some of the irrigation and flood-control projects launched during the Great Leap Forward were successful and are still in use.\n\nIn the years after the Great Leap Forward, the Communist Party of China did not encourage the \"leaping forward\" method of economic development. Instead, it adopted the \"planned economy\" model of development, in which government planners determine what should be produced and in what quantities. This model was supposed to prevent another famine like the one that killed tens of millions of people during the Great Leap Forward. However, the planned economy model also had negative effects. It created inefficiencies that stifled economic growth, and it prevented China from taking advantage of the market forces that fueled the economic growth of other East Asian countries such as Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan.\n\nThe Great Leap Forward is remembered as a failure because it killed tens of millions of people and it prevented China from taking advantage of market forces to fuel economic growth. The Communist Party of China continues to deny these facts, but the famine was so devastating that it is remembered by many Chinese people who were born after the Great Leap Forward."}

The Maya were a very advanced civilization that had a complex writing system, architecture, and mathematics. They also had a highly developed understanding of astronomy and were able to accurately predict the movements of the planets and stars.\n\nThe Maya were also known for their art and architecture. They built large cities with elaborate temples, palaces, and other public buildings. They also created beautiful sculptures, paintings, and other works of art.\n\nOne of the most famous Maya cities is Chichen Itza, which was built between the 9th and 12th centuries AD. Chichen Itza was a large city with a population of about 50,000 people. It was a center of trade and commerce, and it also had a number of important religious buildings, including the Temple of Kukulkan and the Ball Court.\n\nThe Maya were not particularly ethnocentric, however. They did not look down on other native American groups who did not live in cities. In fact, the Maya often traded with and interacted with these other groups.

{"text":"\n\nThe answer is not definitive, but we do know that the idea of children having rights was not commonly accepted until the end of the 18th century. Indeed, before then, children were viewed much like they are today: as vulnerable, and in need of protection. But they were also viewed as possessions, and their interests were seen as being subordinate to the interests of their parents.\n\nThat began to change toward the end of the 18th century, as part of a much larger shift in how people thought about society. This was the Age of Enlightenment, when people began to question traditional authority and to think for themselves. They started to believe that children had rights, and that society should protect those rights.\n\nThe first person to write about children's rights was the French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau. In his book, The Social Contract, he argued that children were not just possessions, but individuals in their own right. He said that they should be protected from harm, and that society should do everything it could to ensure that they were not abused."}
{"text":"\n\nDid the general consumption of spinach in the US increase during the time when Popeye became popular?\n\nAccording to the Center for Science in the Public Interest, spinach consumption in the United States rose by a third between 1931 and 1936, the years when Popeye was first introduced in comic strips and then in a short film. Spinach growers credited Popeye with their success, and even asked the sailor to pose for them in advertisements.\n\nThe rise in spinach consumption, which continued for decades, was not due to children's preferences for Popeye's favorite food. It was due to their mothers' preferences. In 1937, an advertising campaign was launched that claimed spinach would help build strong muscles in young boys. This was at the height of the great depression, when money was tight and malnutrition was common. Mothers believed spinach would help their sons grow up to be healthy and strong.

For many will come in my name, claiming, 'I am the Messiah,' and will deceive many. You will hear of wars and rumors of wars, but see to it that you are not alarmed. Such things must happen, but the end is still to come. Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in various places. All these are the beginning of birth pains.\n\n\"Then you will be handed over to be persecuted and put to death, and you will be hated by all nations because of me. At that time many will turn away from the faith and will betray and hate each other, and many false prophets will appear and deceive many people. Because of the increase of wickedness, the love of most will grow cold, but the one who stands firm to the end will be saved. And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.\n\n\"So when you see standing in the holy place 'the abomination that causes desolation,' spoken of through the prophet Daniel\u2014let the reader understand\u2014then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. Let no one on the housetop go down to take anything out of the house. Let no one in the field go back to get their cloak. How dreadful it will be in those days for pregnant women and nursing mothers! Pray that your flight will not take place in winter or on the Sabbath. For then there will be great distress, unequaled from the beginning of the world until now\u2014and never to be equaled again.\n\n\"If those days had not been cut short, no one would survive, but for the sake of the elect those days will be shortened. At that time if anyone says to you, 'Look, here is the Messiah!' or, 'There he is!' do not believe it. For false messiahs and false prophets will appear and perform great signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect. See, I have told you ahead of time.\n\n\"So if anyone tells you, 'There he is, out in the wilderness,' do not go out; or, 'Here he is, in the inner rooms,' do not believe it. For as lightning that comes from the east is visible even in the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. Wherever there is a carcass, there the vultures will gather.\n\n\"Immediately after the distress of those days\n'the sun will be darkened,\nand the moon will not give its light;\nthe stars will fall from the sky,\nand the heavenly bodies will be shaken.'\n\n\"Then will appear the sign of the Son of Man in heaven. And then all the peoples of the earth will mourn when they see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven, with power and great glory. And he will send his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other.\n\n\"Now learn this lesson from the fig tree: As soon as its twigs get tender and its leaves come out, you know that summer is near. Even so, when you see all these things, you know that it is near, right at the door. Truly I tell you, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened. Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.\n\n\"But about that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father. As it was in the days of Noah, so it will be at the coming of the Son of Man. For in the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, up to the day Noah entered the ark; and they knew nothing about what would happen until the flood came and took them all away. That is how it will be at the coming of the Son of Man. Two men will be in the field; one will be taken and the other left. Two women will be grinding with a hand mill; one will be taken and the other left.\n\n\"Therefore keep watch, because you do not know on what day your Lord will come.

In the early 1970s, Congress finally passed the Occupational Safety and Health Act. The act established the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to assure safe working conditions for men and women. The first OSHA head was Eula Bingham. She had worked in the labor movement for many years.\n\nOSHA sets and enforces standards to ensure that employers provide their employees with a safe workplace. OSHA creates training, education, and assistance programs to help employers and employees comply with the standards. OSHA also sets standards to ensure that employees have a safe work environment, including the safe use of equipment.\n\nIn the United States, OSHA covers most private sector employers and employees in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and other U.S. jurisdictions. State-run health and safety programs must be at least as effective as the federal OSHA program. There are a few exceptions. These include federal agencies, the United States Postal Service, private maritime, and security industries. OSHA also sets and enforces standards for construction work in the U.S. and its territories.\n\nOSHA relies on workplace inspections and penalties to ensure that employers provide their employees with a safe workplace. It also provides educational information and training to employers and employees. In addition, OSHA works with other federal agencies, such as the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), to conduct research on job-related injuries and illnesses."}

The Zodiac Killer, the Son of Sam, and the Boston Strangler all struck within a few short years of one another, sending a message that nowhere was safe.\n\nThen, in the late 1970s, Ted Bundy and John Wayne Gacy became household names, proving that even the most ordinary-looking people could be capable of the most brutal crimes. The term \"serial killer\" was coined in the early 1980s, when the FBI officially recognized that a series of murders in different locations, committed by the same person, were connected. \n\nAs the public became more aware of the threats that could be hiding in plain sight, the number of reported serial killers seemed to grow. According to a report by the Congressional Research Service, there were at least 40 active serial killers in the United States between 1900 and 2000. Of those 40, 31 were active between 1970 and 2000. \n\n\"The 1970s was the decade when serial homicide became a topic of significant concern and study,\" Dr. Peter Martin, a former professor of criminal justice at Seattle University, told The New York Times. \"And it was in the 1970s that the term 'serial killer' came into vogue.\"\n\nBut as crime shows and podcasts have documented the crimes of serial killers, the number of active serial killers at any given time has decreased. It's likely that the drop in serial killings can be attributed to advancements in technology, such as DNA testing, that help law enforcement officials solve cases. In the 1980s, only about 10 percent of homicides were cleared, according to The Washington Post. Today, the clearance rate is closer to 60 percent."}

{"text":"\n\nThe Ethiopian Orthodox Church was founded in the 4th century AD and had developed independently from the rest of the Christian world ever since. The Church of Alexandria in Egypt had established a foothold in Ethiopia in the middle of the 6th century, but it was largely forgotten about after the rise of Islam in the region. As such, Ethiopian Christianity developed with heavy influences from the Coptic and Syriac traditions, which produced a number of unique practices. For instance, Ethiopian Christians used the same liturgy as the Coptic Church, they followed the Julian calendar, and they observed a number of feasts that were unique to their tradition. There were also a number of practices that were more controversial. For instance, Ethiopian priests were allowed to get married and they practiced a form of monophysitism.\n\nWith the rise of the Islamic caliphate, the Ethiopian Church maintained a stronghold in the highlands. And even though they were aware of the rise of the Western European powers, they were largely cut off from the rest of Christendom. The first major European expedition to reach the Ethiopian highlands was organized by the Portuguese in 1520. Francisco Almeida, the first Portuguese viceroy of India, had dispatched a group of Jesuit missionaries to Ethiopia, who arrived in the highlands in 1520. They were received by the Ethiopian emperor Lebna Dengel, who was excited by the prospect of forming an alliance with the Portuguese against the Ottomans. However, the Ethiopian clergy was much more wary of the newcomers. They saw the missionaries as a threat to their traditions and accused them of being Muslim. The Ethiopian emperor eventually allowed the Jesuits to remain in the country, but he prohibited them from interacting with the Ethiopian people.\n\nIn 1527, the Portuguese sent an embassy to the Ethiopian court, which was headed by Rodrigo de Lima. The Ethiopian emperor, who was Lebna Dengel's successor, Gelawdewos, was much more receptive to the Portuguese. He was particularly interested in acquiring military aid from them. As such, de Lima was able to establish a close relationship with the Ethiopian emperor. However, the Ethiopian clergy continued to view the Portuguese with suspicion. In 1540, they launched a campaign to rid the country of the \"infidels\" and they succeeded in convincing Gelawdewos to expel the Portuguese. The expulsion of the Portuguese would prove to be a major blow to the Ethiopian state. In the 1550s, the Ottoman Empire sent an army to invade Ethiopia, and the Ethiopian army was defeated. The Ethiopian state was eventually able to recover, but the Portuguese were never able to establish regular contact with the Ethiopian court."}

The trial of the Rosenbergs was controversial because the couple were convicted on flimsy evidence and possibly perjured testimony, and because the death penalty was seen by many as being excessive.\n\nThe couple were charged with conspiracy to commit espionage. However, they were not charged with actually transferring nuclear secrets to the Soviet Union.\n\nThe chief witness against them was Ethel's brother, David Greenglass, who had worked on the Manhattan Project.

{"text":"\n\nSuicide was not very common in the Middle Ages. Rich people could afford to kill themselves if they wanted to, but most of them had too much to live for. However, among the poor, life was not so pleasant. They had to work very hard, often from dawn to dusk. They were not as healthy as the rich, and often died young. Rich people were more likely to commit suicide because they were depressed, but peasants had more practical reasons to kill themselves.\n\nThe most common reason for suicide among medieval peasants was economic. Many of them were in debt, and their creditors would seize their land and property. Others were so poor that they could not afford to pay taxes, and the government would take their land. This would force the peasants to become beggars or wanderers, and they would be unable to support their families. So, they would kill themselves to escape the misery.\n\nAnother reason for medieval peasant suicide was religious. The Church taught that suicide was a sin, and that the dead would be punished in the afterlife. However, many peasants were so poor that they did not believe in the afterlife. They would commit suicide because they felt that it was the only way to escape the suffering of this life."}

The British were equipped with modern firearms. The Zulus also generally restricted their warfare to traditional hand-to-hand combat, whereas the British used their firearms to maintain distance. \n\nNevertheless, the Zulus were by no means helpless against the British. Their traditional weapons could easily pierce the thin cloth and lightweight metal of the British uniforms. A spear in the leg could immobilize a soldier. The Zulus also developed tactics to negate the British advantage in firearms. For example, they learned that the maximum effective range of a Martini-Henry rifle was only 100 yards, so they charged the British in groups of three: one to engage the soldier with a spear, one to grab the rifle, and one to provide backup. This practice was so successful that the British had to develop new tactics to counter it.\n\nOverall, the British were more heavily armed and armored than their enemies, but the weapons and tactics of their enemies were quite effective. The battles were often quite close-run things."}

At the same time, his \"Great Leap Forward\" and \"Cultural Revolution\" campaigns have been widely criticized for their human rights abuses. To this day, there is still no consensus on Mao's overall legacy.\n\nMao was a complex figure whose personality and policy orientation evolved over time. In the 1920s, he was a young man with a romantic view of the world, believing that the Communist Party and its army could change society. He was not a systematic thinker, and his ideas about how to build socialism were often disorganized. He was a brilliant military strategist and a charismatic leader who could inspire millions of people. In the 1930s, he led the Party and the army to rise up against the invading Japanese army.\n\nAfter 1949, Mao consolidated his power by purging his political opponents, who were either executed or sent to labor camps. He then launched the \"Great Leap Forward,\" an attempt to catch up with Western countries in the development of heavy industry. The campaign led to a famine that killed tens of millions of people. In the \"Cultural Revolution\" of the 1960s and 1970s, he encouraged young people to criticize anything traditional, including Chinese culture and values. The campaign resulted in a decade of chaos and violence.\n\nMao's death in 1976 led to a power struggle that ended with the rise of Deng Xiaoping. Under Deng, China gradually began to open up to the outside world and embrace capitalism. Deng's policies of reform and opening-up have led to China's economic miracle.\n\nIn China today, there is still no consensus on how to view Mao. Some people see him as a great leader who made China independent and developed. Others see him as a tyrant who caused untold suffering. In recent years, there has been a campaign to rehabilitate Mao's image, and many Chinese are once again embracing his ideas.\n\nIn conclusion, Mao is still a controversial figure in China.

While there were other contributing factors to this decline, one of the main reasons was that the Byzantine Empire was simply not as powerful as it used to be. This can be seen in the fact that it took the Ottoman Empire, which was a much smaller and less developed state, only a few years to conquer the Byzantine Empire. Additionally, the Byzantine Empire was also facing increasing pressure from the west, as the European states were beginning to expand their power and influence into the region. If the Byzantine Empire had been able to fend off the Ottoman Empire at Constantinople, it is likely that it would have survived for a little while longer.

And Hamlet had to decide whether to kill his uncle, who murdered Hamlet's father and took the throne.\n\nShakespeare's plays were also popular because they were exciting. There were sword fights, murders, and love stories. And the plays were easy to understand, even if you didn't know much about English history.

Sickle cell trait is much more common in areas of the world that malaria is prevalent, such as in Africa. The trait is not as common in areas of the world that malaria is not as common, such as parts of Asia and Europe. This shows that the distribution of the sickle cell trait is related to the distribution of malaria. Since people with the sickle cell trait have an advantage in areas with malaria, they are more likely to survive and reproduce, which causes the trait to become more common in these areas."}

Women had fewer rights, and there was a clear gender division of labor. The Bolsheviks thought that the family was a \"class institution\" and that the nuclear family oppressed women. Divorce and abortion were both legalized.\n\nDespite these efforts, women still did most of the housework and childcare. Although women worked outside the home, they were expected to return to their traditional roles once they married. Women could join the Communist Party, work in factories, and even serve in the military. However, these gains were limited. In the 1930s, women's wages were reduced. Women were not allowed to be leaders in the party, and they rarely rose to the top ranks of the military. Many women also objected to the government's emphasis on women's equality. For example, in the 1920s, some women campaigned for the right to be nude models, but the government opposed this. Many women also felt that the state was trying to take away their children by making divorce and abortion legal.\n\nEven though women could join the military, they were not allowed to fight on the front lines. The government believed that women should not be exposed to the dangers of battle. Women were also not allowed to join the Communist Party, which meant that they could not hold leadership positions. Despite these limitations, women were able to find success in the Soviet Union. Many women became doctors, engineers, and teachers. Others became writers, artists, and scientists. However, women still faced discrimination in the workplace and at home.\n\nIn conclusion, women in the Soviet Union had more opportunities than women in many other countries.

{"text":"\n\nThe Greeks and Romans had no understanding of bacteria or viruses, so they had no way to combat the diseases that commonly swept through their cities. Instead, they believed that many illnesses were caused by curses or the gods' punishment. One way to avoid such illnesses was to pray to the gods for protection. The Greeks also believed that the sick should be isolated to prevent the spread of disease. In some cases, they required people with serious illnesses to leave the city and live in isolation until they recovered or died. For this reason, leprosy, which causes disfigurement, was especially feared. Lepers were forced to leave cities and live in leper colonies. The Greeks and Romans also used drugs and potions to treat illness. They knew that certain plants could be used as medicine, and they created drugs to treat a variety of ailments.\n\nUnfortunately, the drugs of ancient Greece had little or no effect on most diseases. In fact, they sometimes made patients worse. The most common drugs were made from the poppy plant. Opium, a substance found in the plant, was used to make a drug called \"opium,\" which was used to relieve pain. People with headaches or other minor pains might be given opium to help them feel better. The Greeks and Romans also used herbs to treat disease. They believed that the body had to be \"balanced\" in order to be healthy. Herbs were used to help the body get rid of excess \"humors,\" or fluids, that caused illness. The Greeks and Romans also used surgery to treat disease. They were able to set broken bones and repair wounds. They even performed operations on the eyes and other parts of the body. However, surgery was often painful and dangerous, and patients sometimes died from the operation."}

He developed the first alternating current (AC) motor, which is still used today. He also invented the Tesla coil, which is used in radio and television sets.\n\nBut Tesla was also a very controversial figure. He was known for his eccentric behavior and his tendency to make wild claims about his inventions. For example, he claimed to have invented a machine that could transmit electricity wirelessly. This machine was never actually built, and it was later proven to be impossible.\n\nThere is no doubt that Tesla was a brilliant inventor. But he was also a very flawed person. He was often accused of being a fraud and a con artist. And he had a number of failed business ventures.\n\nSo, why is there a new cult appreciation of Tesla? It is probably a combination of factors. First of all, Tesla was a very interesting character. He was a brilliant inventor, but he was also a very flawed person. Second, there is a lot of hype surrounding Tesla and his inventions. People are always looking for the next big thing, and Tesla is a good example of that. Finally, Tesla is a very popular topic right now. There are a number of books and movies about Tesla, and he is a favorite topic of discussion among tech enthusiasts."}

Many of these small-scale operations were based out of the home.\n\nOn the other hand, there were also many jobs that were filled by government employees or government slaves. For example, many of the men who worked on the extensive Roman road system were government slaves. The same was true of many of the employees of the imperial post.\n\nThe reason why this was possible was that, in the Roman world, there was no concept of a minimum wage. In other words, a slave or a free worker could be paid as little as his or her employer saw fit. Thus, many owners of businesses preferred to hire slaves rather than free men, since this meant that they did not have to pay a salary."}

The beaver was reintroduced to parts of its former range by the 20th century, but its numbers are still well below historical levels.\n\nBeaver pelts were in high demand because they were used to make felt hats. The felt made from beaver fur was durable and waterproof, making it ideal for hats. However, the demand for beaver pelts was so high that it could not be met by the wild population. In order to meet the demand, trappers began to trap beavers in the wild and raise them in captivity. This practice, known as \"beaver ranching,\" allowed for the controlled breeding of beavers and the production of felt hats. However, the practice of beaver ranching was not without its problems. Beavers are social animals and do not thrive in captivity. As a result, the animals often became sick and died before they could be used for their fur. In addition, the practice of beaver ranching was expensive and time-consuming, and it was eventually replaced by the use of synthetic materials for felt hats."}

The fact that it was also the most advanced in many areas meant that it had little need to acquire anything from the West. In the centuries that followed, the size of China relative to the rest of the world meant that it was not a great priority for the Chinese to learn much about the West. There were some small-scale contacts, but nothing that would prepare the Chinese for the arrival of the European powers in the late eighteenth century.\n\nThe first significant Western contacts with China occurred in the late Ming and early Qing dynasties, when the growing power of the West began to intrude on China's traditional world order. In the late sixteenth century, the Portuguese established a trading presence in southern China, and over the following century, they and other Western powers established a network of trading ports and enclaves in the South China Sea. These contacts exposed the Chinese to Western ideas and technologies, and the Chinese were quick to recognize the potential threat that the West posed. The late Ming and early Qing dynasties saw a significant increase in the number of translations of Western works, and the Chinese began to study the West in earnest.\n\nBy the nineteenth century, the Chinese had a fairly good understanding of the West, but they were still largely unprepared for the arrival of the Western powers. The Opium War of 1839-1842 was a major shock to the Chinese, and it exposed the many weaknesses of the Chinese state.

Coffee became prominent in Seattle due to the city's close proximity to coffee-growing regions, the arrival of Italian immigrants who brought their coffee-drinking traditions to the city, and the development of the coffee industry by local businesses. The city's coffee culture was further shaped by the rise of Starbucks, which was founded in Seattle and helped to popularize coffee drinks such as the Frappuccino and the latte. Today, Seattle is known for its coffee-loving residents and its many coffee shops."}
{"text":"\nThe Swastika is an ancient symbol found throughout Asia, and its use in the Western world has a long history. It is most often seen in the form of a religious symbol in Hinduism and Buddhism, but it has also been used as a political symbol by various groups. In the late 19th century, it was adopted as a symbol of German nationalism and later became associated with Nazism and the Holocaust. As a result, its use in the Western world has been largely restricted to historical and academic contexts. However, the Swastika is still used in some religious and cultural contexts in Asia, and it is not uncommon to see it used as a decorative element in art and architecture. It is important to note that the meaning and use of the Swastika vary widely across cultures, and it is not appropriate to generalize its significance based on its use in the Western world."}
{"text":"\nThe Gallic armies that Caesar faced are frequently depicted as an impetuous, shirtless mass of warriors whose immense individual fighting prowess was dragged down by their poor discipline, light armor, and poor military theory. This is only partially true. Gallic armies were indeed lightly armored, undisciplined, and somewhat chaotic, but they were also capable of great bravery and ingenuity on the battlefield. Unlike the armies of classical Greece or Rome, Gallic war hosts did not have a single, central command structure. Instead, they were often made up of multiple, sometimes feuding, tribes who would only agree to serve under a single commander in times of great crisis. The overall Gallic military culture emphasized individual combat prowess and courage in battle. Gallic warriors were also somewhat pragmatic. They generally eschewed the use of heavy armor, preferring to be as mobile as possible, and would sometimes fight naked in order to have maximum freedom of movement. They also placed a great deal of emphasis on the use of cavalry, and would often break into rout if their horsemen were thrown into disarray. All in all, Gallic armies were formidable opponents, but their lack of discipline and heavy equipment often left them vulnerable to the more organized and well-disciplined Roman legions."}
{"text":"\n\nThe laws of the Byzantine Empire were indeed complex, compared to those of contemporary states. The Byzantine legal system was based on Roman law, and it was modified and expanded over the course of the empire's existence. The laws were written in Greek, and they were often difficult to understand and apply. In addition, the legal system was very rigid, and it did not allow for much flexibility. This often led to injustice, as people were unable to get the justice they deserved. Overall, the Byzantine legal system was complex and difficult to navigate, and it often failed to deliver justice."}
{"text":"\n\nRoosevelt won an unprecedented third term as president in 1940. With war in Europe looming, Roosevelt believed that only he could lead the United States through the crisis. He also wanted to continue the New Deal reforms. Despite his desire to stay in office, Roosevelt was reluctant to seek a third term. He did not want to be seen as violating the spirit of the 22nd amendment, which limited presidents to two terms. In the end, however, Roosevelt felt that the crisis in Europe was too great to ignore. He announced that he would run for a third term. \n\nRoosevelt's decision to run for a third term was not well received by all members of the Democratic Party. Some Democrats believed that it was time for a new leader. Others were concerned that Roosevelt's health was failing. In addition, some Democrats feared that Roosevelt's decision to run for a third term would hurt the party's chances in the 1940 election. Despite these concerns, Roosevelt was ultimately successful in his bid for a third term. However, by the time of his fourth election, \"Roosevelt Fatigue\" had set in. Many Americans were tired of Roosevelt and wanted a change. As a result, Roosevelt's support among Democrats began to wane."}
{"text":"\n\nArnold was a capable officer and an able leader who served the patriot cause well, but he was also an opportunist who used the Revolution for his own purposes. Arnold was a businessman who, like many of the founding fathers, speculated in land and other ventures using money borrowed from foreign investors. Unlike many of the founders, Arnold was in significant debt, and when the Revolution began, he found himself unable to secure new funding.\n\nIn 1775, the Continental Congress commissioned Arnold as a commander in the Continental Army. In the summer of 1777, he distinguished himself in the battle for Fort Ticonderoga. The following year, he led a daring expedition through the wilderness of Maine to the sea, capturing the British garrison at Valcour Island on Lake Champlain. Arnold was seriously wounded in the leg, and he spent the winter of 1778 in the hospital. When he recovered, he was given command of Philadelphia. Arnold was popular in the city, and he lived with his mistress, Margaret \"Peggy\" Shippen, whom he eventually married.\n\nWhen the war ended, Arnold's debts continued to mount, and he became desperate for cash. He also became convinced that the country would never be able to pay the debts owed to him and other veterans of the war. He started looking for other ways to make money, including speculation in land and other business ventures.\n\nIn 1780, Arnold received a letter from the British government offering him a commission in the army and a generous annual salary of \u00a36,000 (approximately $1 million today). Arnold was also promised a loan of \u00a310,000 (approximately $2 million today) to cover his debts. Arnold was convinced that the country could never repay its debts to him and that his future financial security depended on his joining the British army.\n\nArnold also felt that he had been mistreated by the Continental Congress and the state governments. He had been repeatedly passed over for promotion, and he had been denied the rank of major general. In 1778, he had been court-martialed for using harsh measures in putting down a mutiny, and he had been found guilty of using excessive force. He was also angry that the Continental Congress had not given him any money to help pay his debts.\n\nIn 1780, Arnold met with the British agent Major John Andr\u00e9 to discuss his plans to betray West Point. Andr\u00e9 was captured by the Americans, and Arnold was forced to flee to New York City. He eventually sailed to England, where he lived out the rest of his life.\n\nHistorians have taken a more sympathetic view of Arnold in recent years. They point out that he was a product of his time, and that he was not the only one to profit from the Revolution. They also note that he was not a traitor, since he did not join the British army until after the war had ended."}

{"text":"\nThe typical method for collecting rainwater on a ship was to have the crew manually gather the water and direct it into a tank or cistern. A sailor would climb the rigging to the top of the mast and spread a cloth to gather the rainwater. Then they would send the water down to the deck using a system of buckets and ropes. This method was used as early as the 16th century.\n\nAnother technique involved \"desalinating\" seawater using evaporation. A fire was built on the deck and sea water was placed in a metal pan over the fire. The salt in the water would remain in the pan after the water evaporated, leaving salt crystals behind. The remaining salt crystals were then rinsed with fresh water to create drinkable water. This method was used on long sea voyages in the 17th and 18th centuries."}

{"text":"\n\nThe divergence of Spanish and Portuguese from Latin began in the 9th century. At that time, the Iberian Peninsula was under the control of the Caliphate of Cordoba, a Moorish Islamic state. The small Christian minority in the north, which had migrated there during the Muslim conquest of the 711 AD, began to take back control of their lands. The Christians gradually expanded southward, reconquering the peninsula and establishing kingdoms such as the Kingdom of Le\u00f3n and the Kingdom of Portugal. As the Christian kingdoms grew stronger, they began to push back against the Muslims, who were forced to retreat to the southernmost part of the peninsula. This division of territory led to the development of two distinct languages and cultures, Spanish and Portuguese. The two languages began to diverge from Latin as the two groups of people grew more and more distant from each other. By the 12th century, Spanish and Portuguese were two distinct languages, with their own dialects and pronunciations. This divergence was further exacerbated by the fact that the two groups of people were not just geographically separated, but also politically and religiously divided. The Christians in the north were united under the banner of the Kingdom of Le\u00f3n, while the Muslims in the south were united under the Caliphate of Cordoba. These two groups rarely interacted with each other, and as a result, their languages evolved in different directions."}

{"text":"\nSure, historians have to go on the historical texts and documents that have been discovered, but they also have to go on artifacts and other items from the past.  Think about all of the stuff that archeologists have found.  Granted, some of the things they have found have been a little mundane, but some of the stuff they have found have been very important in helping us understand what happened in the past.  For example, without the archeological evidence that has been found, we would not have known about the Indus Valley civilization.  One of the reasons that history as a discipline moves forward is because historians use both the texts and the artifacts.  They also use what they know about the society in which the texts and artifacts were made to analyze the texts and artifacts.  For example, when historians find a text that was written by someone who was living in a society in which women were not equal to men, they have to take that into consideration when they are analyzing the text.  They can't just analyze the text without considering that factor.  Also, when historians find a text that was written by someone who was living in a society in which people of different ethnicities were not equal, they have to take that into consideration as well.  You can't just analyze the text without considering that factor either.  So, you see, analyzing the historical texts and documents is not purely speculation.  Of course, historians do have to speculate at times, but it is not just speculation.  They do have facts to go on as well."}
{"text":"\n\nWhen Columbus returned from his first voyage to the New World in 1493, he brought a number of captured natives with him to show the riches of the New World to the monarchs of Spain. Though some of these natives died shortly after arriving in Europe, news of the existence of a new continent spread quickly. The idea of a western route to Asia was not new. As early as the second century A.D., the Greek astronomer and geographer Claudius Ptolemaeus (aka Ptolemy) had suggested that a habitable \"Antarctic\" continent might exist in the southern polar regions. By the time of Columbus's voyage, the idea of such a continent had become accepted by educated Europeans. The Italian-born explorer Amerigo Vespucci, who participated in several expeditions to the New World, is actually the source of the name \"America.\" During his fourth and most famous voyage to the New World, he realized that the landmass discovered by Columbus and later explored by Vespucci was not the eastern edge of Asia, but an entirely separate continent. News of the discovery of this \"New World\" spread quickly throughout Europe, where it had an enormous impact on the course of European history. The \"New World\" provided Europe with a vast, seemingly limitless source of wealth and natural resources. It also offered European Christians an opportunity to spread their faith to non-believers in a new part of the world. The discovery of the New World had a profound impact on the history and culture of Europe, and it changed the way Europeans viewed their place in the world."}

It was called the Pax Mongolica, or the Mongol Peace, and it lasted for about 100 years. It guaranteed safe passage for merchants and diplomats, and it also brought the Silk Road under one authority. This encouraged trade, the exchange of ideas, and cultural assimilation.\n\nThe Mongols had launched a couple of invasions into Europe, the first in 1236, when they tried to invade Poland and Hungary. But the Hungarians, with their cavalry, were able to defeat the much larger army.\n\nWhen Kublai Khan began his conquest of China, he also sent emissaries to the kings of Europe to demand their submission. He thought he could take over the world. The Europeans were not worried about this possibility.\n\nMarco Polo had recently returned from China, and the Mongols were regarded with fear and respect. But Europeans had no idea that the Mongols were planning to invade them. In fact, it was the other way around: the Mongols were preparing to invade Japan.\n\nThe invasion of Europe was not even on the radar of the kings of Europe. When the Mongols began their invasion, they were surprised by the resistance they encountered. They were used to submission, and they were not prepared for war."}

{"text":"\n\nLetters of marque were special licenses issued by the Congress of the United States that allowed private citizens to arm and equip merchant vessels and wage war against the enemies of the United States. During the late 18th century, the young American republic had few ships to protect its trade with Europe. In 1793, the Washington administration authorized the arming of merchant ships for self-defense, which helped increase American trade, but also provoked controversy. Critics charged that the arming of merchant ships violated the nation's neutrality and would lead to an increase in piracy. Supporters of the policy, including Alexander Hamilton, argued that the arming of merchant ships was necessary to ensure the safety of American trade. In 1794, Congress passed a law that explicitly allowed the arming of merchant ships and established rules for their governance. In the following year, Congress passed another law that explicitly allowed the arming of merchant ships and established rules for their governance. These laws were in effect until the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815. During this period, hundreds of American ships were granted letters of marque."}

{"text":"\nThe British Royal Ordinance 105mm L7 tank gun was so revolutionary because it was the first tank gun to use the rifled barrel and breech-loaded mechanism. This allowed for a much higher muzzle velocity and greater accuracy than previous tank guns. The gun was also much lighter than previous designs, which allowed for a much higher rate of fire. These features made the L7 gun much more effective than previous tank guns, and it quickly became the standard for NATO tanks. Germany, the US, Japan and Israel all chose to licence the design for their tanks instead of designing their own tank guns because it was a proven and reliable design. It was also much cheaper to licence the design than to develop a new tank gun from scratch."}

He was sentenced to 18 years in prison, but only served six years. Many felt that it was inappropriate to appoint a convicted war criminal as a military adviser, especially since the purpose of the NATO was to promote democracy and human rights."}
{"text":"\nIn the United States, karate became very popular as a martial art. It was popularized by such Hollywood films as those of Bruce Lee. However, the actual practice of karate in the United States was often modified. The reason for this is that the majority of Americans who began training were not accustomed to the rigorous discipline of traditional karate. The changes that were made to karate in the United States tended to make it more like a sport. For example, the practice of kata (pre-arranged sets of defensive and offensive movements) was deemphasized in favor of sparring and the practice of kumite (sparring). The popularity of point-stop sparring tournaments in the United States gave rise to a style of karate known as \"sport karate.\" Because of this, the American style of karate has become very practical, focusing on self-defense. However, it lacks the spiritual aspects of traditional karate, which have been deemphasized. This is not to say that traditional karate is not taught in the United States. It is, and it is practiced by many people. But it is not as popular as the sport-oriented style."}

These whites were descended from indentured servants, convicts, and other working-class British stock, who felt they had more in common with the slave-owning planter class than with the black slaves. They also felt they had more in common with the Native Americans than with blacks. It is worth noting that many whites in the South also claimed to have Native American ancestry, usually through a female line.\n\nDuring the colonial era, the British, who controlled the colonies, had a much more ambiguous relationship with the Native Americans than they did with the African slaves. While they certainly did not respect Native American autonomy, they also did not feel the same degree of contempt and fear that they did with regard to the slaves. In fact, the British often found it convenient to ally with the Native Americans against the French and Spanish, who were the colonial rivals of the British.\n\nThis dynamic began to change during the era of the American Revolution. While the British were still reluctant to give up their colonies in the South, they were also determined to keep the support of the Native Americans. Thus, the British began to offer the slaves their freedom in exchange for fighting in the war against the American rebels. Many slaves took advantage of this opportunity, and they fought on the side of the British. After the war, the British were no longer able to maintain their control over the colonies, and they were forced to free the slaves.

John agreed to the terms of the alliance, which was to be sealed by his conversion to Islam. He even agreed to send his son, Henry, to be raised at the court of al-Adil in Egypt.\n\nHowever, the conversion was never carried out. Fakhr al-Din and the other emissaries left England after the negotiations, but John had second thoughts about the deal. He had already antagonized the Catholic Church by seizing church lands, and converting to Islam would have been seen as an even greater act of betrayal. In 1216 CE, Pope Innocent III placed an interdict on England, which meant that no Christian could receive the sacraments in England.

{"text":"\n\nAfter the First World War, Japan experienced a rise of ultranationalism. The Versailles Treaty, which punished Japan for its role in the war, was one of the main catalysts for this nationalism. The military gained power in Japan, fueling a growing sense of nationalism. One of the main goals of this nationalism was to create a pure-blooded Japanese race. The military government passed laws to exclude people with mixed heritage from certain government and social positions. These laws also fueled the growing racism that already existed in Japan. The ultranationalism grew more radical after the Second World War, when Japan lost and was occupied by the Allies. The military government was removed, and a new constitution was created. This constitution was supposed to demilitarize Japan and take away the power of the military. Because of this, the Japanese people felt a sense of shame and began to think that their emperor was weak. Many Japanese thought that the only way to save their country was to go to war. This thinking created the perfect environment for a radical group like the Black Dragon Society to form."}

It was a very tight formation, usually 8 men deep, that maximized the effectiveness of the spears and sarissas (pikes) that the men carried. The men in the front ranks would project their weapons out past the front rank, creating a solid wall of spear points. \n\nThe main difference between the Greek, Macedonian, and Phoenician phalanxes was the equipment used.

This phenomenon has been observed in other places following major storms, but it had not previously been documented on Palmyra Atoll."}

And Fosters \u2014 the brand that reigned supreme as the country's most popular beer \u2014 was about to be dumped. After almost 50 years of Australians declaring their love for the beer \"made under the sun\" (and drinking it by the gallon), Fosters was suddenly being described as \"rancid piss\" and \"liquid shite\". It was the greatest beer dump in Australia's history, and it all began with a single word: Skol.\n\nIn 1995, global brewing giant Lion Nathan introduced a new beer to the Australian market: Skol. The company had high hopes for the brand and poured millions of dollars into an advertising campaign to launch it. But they didn't bank on one thing: Australians have never been a particularly sentimental bunch, and the campaign's tagline \u2014 \"The Great One\" \u2014 was about to trigger a national identity crisis.\n\nUp until that point, the vast majority of beer commercials on Australian television had been fairly similar. You'd see a bunch of guys (they were always guys) having a good time, then at the end of the ad, they'd all be laughing and joking while enjoying a beer. But the Skol ads were different. In them, a group of men would be sitting around looking miserable, then one of them would say something positive and everyone else would look happy again. It was weird. Australians hated it.\n\nAs a nation, we have a tendency to resent any attempt to tell us what to do or how to behave. And the \"Great One\" campaign was basically telling us that the only way to be happy was to drink Skol. It was an attempt to create a national beer-drinking culture, and we weren't having any of it.\n\nSo we did what any self-respecting group of Australians would do: we turned our backs on Skol and embraced the beer that was the complete opposite of it. We bought VB."}
{"text":"\nThe opening of Japan in the mid-19th century resulted in a cultural fascination with the West, particularly France. At the time, France was seen as the epitome of modernity, having abolished the monarchy and embraced the ideals of the Enlightenment. The Japanese were particularly drawn to French culture because it offered an alternative to the strictures of traditional Japanese society. The French emphasis on individuality and personal freedom was a welcome change from the highly codified and hierarchical Japanese society. The Japanese also admired the French for their achievements in the arts and sciences, as well as their military and political power. The French Revolution was a particularly influential event in Japanese history, as it served as a model for the overthrow of the shogunate and the establishment of the Meiji government. In short, the Japanese were deeply impressed by the achievements of French culture and saw it as a model for their own society."}

{"text":"\n\nThe state of Israel was created in part by the United Nations partition of Palestine in November 1947, which awarded Jews a state on 56 percent of the land.  The rest of the land was to be an international enclave, or a Palestinian Arab state.  In actuality, there was no such place as Palestine.  The name had been coined by the Romans after they destroyed the Jewish Temple in 70 AD and renamed the area Palestina, meaning Philistine, the name the Romans gave the residents of the land.  The Jews were ethnically cleansed from the area, which became an Arab-Muslim state in the seventh century.  As such, there was no real Palestine on the ground.  The name was revived in the late nineteenth century by the Ottoman Turks, who called the area south of Syria and Lebanon Filistin.  In the early twentieth century, the name was adopted by the British, who controlled the area after World War I, as a way to differentiate the Jews from the Arabs.  The British controlled the area under a mandate from the League of Nations, which they created after World War I.  The mandate was awarded to Britain because it had been the chief Allied power in defeating the Ottomans.  The mandate was to prepare the area for independence, which the League of Nations had awarded to the Jews.  But Britain had other ideas, as it did not want to see the Jews create their own state in the area.  Thus, the British reneged on the League of Nations mandate, and instead created the state of Trans-Jordan, now called Jordan, for the Arabs.  The British supported the Arabs in the region against the Jews.  As a result, the Jews were forced to wage war against the British in order to create their own state.  This was accomplished with the British withdrawal from the area in May 1948, and the proclamation of the State of Israel on May 14, 1948."}

However, as is often the case with Internet trends, the current popularity of \"Your Mom\" jokes are a recent phenomenon. Jokes of this type were not always popular, and there was a time when other joke types were more common.\n\nOne type of joke that was once popular but no longer makes sense is celebrity jokes. While celebrity jokes can still be funny, the humor in them often relies on a person's fame and public image. With the ever-increasing pace of change in the world, it can be difficult to keep up with who is famous and why. Therefore, jokes about celebrities can seem dated and can struggle to resonate with audiences.\n\nAnother type of joke that was once popular but no longer makes sense is local-centric jokes. These are jokes that rely on local knowledge or experiences to be funny. However, as the world becomes more interconnected, it can be difficult for people to relate to these jokes. In addition, as people move around more, local experiences can vary greatly, making it difficult to create a universally funny joke.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Your Mom\" jokes, celebrity jokes, and local-centric jokes were all once popular but no longer make sense in today's world.

{"text":"\n\nThe hinged door was not invented until a very late date, and in many places it has not yet replaced the door of hide. Wherever we find stone or metal, which can be carved or worked into a catch or latch, we find the use of the hide door. Even in our own time, in the most advanced communities, the native Indian still uses the hide door, and in some of the coldest countries of the world. Wherever we go in the world, we find the use of the hide door. The poorer people are, the more they use it. The richer people are, the less they use it. Wherever we go in the world, we find people using the hide door.\n\nThe most common form of the hide door is the single piece of hide, or skin, with the hair side inwards, and this must have been the first kind of door used. There is a very old one in the church of Santa Maria del Mar at Barcelona, which is a good example of this kind of door. This church was built in the fourteenth century, and this door is supposed to be two hundred years older. The church is in the Gothic style, and the door is in the same style. It is a very simple, unsmoothed piece of hide, with the hair side inwards, and the handle is simply a hole in the hide.\n\nIt was not until the sixteenth century that architects seem to have thought of using planks of wood instead of hide. The earliest example I have found is in the church of Santa Maria delle Anime del Purgatorio, at Prato. This church was begun in 1486, and finished in 1493, and the doors are described by an Italian writer of the sixteenth century as an ingenious device. He says that the hinges were made of iron, and that the planks of wood, which formed the door, were so well joined together that it was impossible to see where they joined.\n\nBut it was not until the seventeenth century that the hinged doors were used in domestic architecture. In England, where the oldest wooden houses have been destroyed, we have to go back to the Elizabethan times to find the use of wooden doors, and even these were sometimes carved. In the United States, the oldest houses are of stone, and the oldest wooden houses, in the North, are very simple in their construction, and their doors were probably of the simplest kind."}

In a letter to his brother Bob, he wrote: 'For me, the point of honour is not so much that I will not take a title ... but that I will not be the first to take it. It is a point of honour with me, that I will not do anything that is not insisted upon by the people concerned, and that I will not push myself forward in any way whatever.\n\nHe also wrote that he did not want to be \"posterity's slave\".\n\nHistorians point to two other factors that might have influenced Lawrence's decision. First, he did not want to be pigeonholed into a life of conventional conformity. Second, he may have wanted to protect the reputation of his parents. His father, Bob, was an alcoholic, who had deserted his wife and children. His mother, Sarah, had brought the family up as Catholics, but after Bob left, she converted to Judaism.

It wasn't until the early 1900s that the modern oxygen mask was developed. This new mask was made of rubber and was much more comfortable to wear. It also had a valve that would allow the firefighter to regulate the flow of air, which made it easier to breathe.\n\nThis new mask was a game-changer for firefighters.

Celtic warriors fought in their own style. They often fought naked, perhaps relying on the psychological impact of their size and intimidating appearance to strike fear into their enemies. The Roman military was well organized and disciplined. Individual soldiers fought as part of a unit and were expected to follow orders. \n\nAccording to the Greek historian Polybius, the Celts were \"great warriors, with bodies almost too large for their strength\". He also described them as \"high-spirited, and most prone to attack the enemy by night, when they would surround them and kill those who resisted, and those who tried to escape by flight, hampered as they were by the weight of their armour, were slain by the cavalry\".\n\nCeltic warfare was, at least in part, based on honor and prestige. To lose in battle was to lose honor, and much of a warrior's honor came from the number of people he had killed in battle. Celtic society had a warrior class, and warfare was considered a noble and prestigious pursuit. Celtic armies would often fight to the death, and the only way to end a battle was for one side to utterly destroy the other. The Romans, on the other hand, valued tactics and strategy. Their armies would retreat if they thought they could win in a later battle, and they valued their own lives. \n\nWhile both Roman and Celtic soldiers were well-trained and could be quite effective, the differences in their cultures meant that they fought very differently. For example, Celtic soldiers would often charge head-on against the enemy, while Roman soldiers would use tactics and strategy to their advantage. The Romans were very good at siege warfare, and they would often use this skill to their advantage."}

{"text":"\n\nOn the morning of December 7, 1941, Japan attacked the United States at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. The attack, also referred to as the \"Day of Infamy,\" came as a devastating surprise to the American people and led to the United States' formal entry into World War II.\n\nAfter decades of aggressive expansion in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Japan became increasingly concerned about the growing influence of the Western powers (especially the United States, Great Britain, and the Netherlands) in Asia. These fears intensified after the outbreak of World War I, when Japan found itself increasingly surrounded by countries hostile to its interests. Determined to secure its own territories in China and Korea and to create a \"Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere\" under Japanese leadership, Japan embarked on a campaign of conquest and colonization. The United States responded to this aggression by placing an oil embargo on Japan in July 1941.\n\nWith its navy rendered virtually powerless by the oil embargo, Japan was determined to break the American advantage in the Pacific. Japanese military leaders were particularly concerned about the U.S. Navy's presence in Hawaii, the Philippines, and other parts of the Pacific.

The U.S. government, however, insisted that Japan withdraw from China and other areas of Southeast Asia before the pact could be signed. On November 29, the Japanese government formally rejected the American counterproposal, and the Japanese military began preparations for an attack on the United States.\n\nIn the predawn hours of December 7, 1941, the Japanese attacked the U.S. naval base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. The surprise attack, which was intended to neutralize the U.S. Navy's ability to interfere with Japan's military actions in Southeast Asia, was also intended to boost the morale of the Japanese people, who had been told that the Americans had been plotting an attack on Japan.\n\nThe attack on Pearl Harbor was, in effect, a preemptive strike\u2014a strike launched in anticipation of an enemy attack. In the days before the attack, Japanese forces also launched assaults on British Hong Kong and the British-held Malaya (in present-day Malaysia). On December 8, 1941 (December 9 in Asia), the United States declared war on Japan. Three days later, Germany and Italy (Japan's allies in the Axis powers) declared war on the United States."}
{"text":"\n\nThe legend of Prester John was used by Western Christians to spread the idea of Christian kingdoms existing in non-Christian areas of the world, and provided a sort of justification for Western colonial expansion. It also fed the belief that the world was round.\nThe myth of Prester John was probably inspired by the presence of Nestorian Christians in the East. Nestorians were a sect of Christianity that existed in the Middle East and China. Their beliefs were heretical to the Catholic Church, but they were one of the earliest sects to translate the Bible into Chinese. The Nestorians also had a reputation for being skilled healers, which may have led to the idea of a Christian kingdom in which the ruler was also a kind of holy man.\n\nFor a long time, Europeans believed that there was a massive Christian empire in the East. Marco Polo, the famous explorer who visited China in the late 13th century, claimed to have met the ruler of this empire. However, it is unlikely that Polo was referring to a real person. In the 15th century, a Portuguese priest named Fern\u00e3o Mendes Pinto claimed that he had visited this kingdom and found that the ruler was not a Christian.\n\nIn the 19th century, British explorer Sir Richard Francis Burton tried to find the land of Prester John. He failed to do so, and concluded that the legend of Prester John was based on a real person who had been transformed into a myth. He suggested that the story of Prester John was a distorted version of the life of the historical figure John of Montecorvino."}

{"text":"\n\nWhen Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back was first released in 1980, audiences were genuinely surprised when it was revealed that Darth Vader was in fact Luke Skywalker's father. This twist, which has since become a staple of popular culture, was not only unexpected but also groundbreaking in terms of storytelling. The revelation that Darth Vader was once Anakin Skywalker, a Jedi Knight who had been seduced by the dark side of the Force, added an emotional depth to the character that had not been seen before in a science fiction film. It also provided a new perspective on the nature of good and evil, as it revealed that even the most seemingly evil characters may have once been good. The impact of this revelation on the Star Wars franchise cannot be overstated, as it fundamentally changed the way that fans viewed the series and its characters. For many, it was a heartbreaking moment that made them question everything they thought they knew about the Star Wars universe. For others, it was a thrilling twist that added a new layer of complexity to the story. Either way, it is clear that the reveal that Darth Vader was Luke Skywalker's father was a moment that will forever change the way that fans experience the Star Wars franchise."}

For example, in countries where the dominant religion uses a holy book written in a right-to-left script, such as the Quran, the Bible, and the Tanakh, the language is often written the same way. Right-to-left writing systems are also more common in countries where the majority of the population is literate, since writing from left to right would be impractical. In addition, right-to-left writing systems are often easier to learn and use than left-to-right writing systems, since they are more consistent with the way that people naturally read and write. Finally, right-to-left writing systems are often considered more aesthetically pleasing than left-to-right writing systems, since they are more symmetrical and balanced. Overall, right-to-left writing systems are popular because they are practical, intuitive, and visually appealing."}

While Forrest Gump's IQ is not explicitly stated in the film, it is implied to be below average due to his limited intellectual ability and naivety. However, despite his low IQ, Forrest Gump would have likely been able to enlist in the military due to the low enlistment standards of the time. During the Vietnam War, the United States military was facing significant manpower shortages and was forced to lower its enlistment standards in order to meet the demand for soldiers. As a result, many individuals with limited intellectual ability and educational attainment were able to enlist in the military, including those with below-average IQs. In this context, it is likely that Forrest Gump would have been able to enlist in the military despite his limited intellectual ability."}

In the 18th and 19th centuries, many countries expressed their objections to the United States' actions. These objections were often based on the fact that the United States was violating the rights of Native Americans. For example, in 1826, the French government issued a statement condemning the United States for its treatment of Native Americans. The statement said, \"The government of the United States, while pretending to protect the interests of the Indian tribes, has, in reality, done nothing but harm them. It has destroyed their means of subsistence, robbed them of their lands, and subjected them to the most cruel and degrading treatment.

It particularly commemorates Saint Patrick, one of Ireland's patron saints, who ministered Christianity in Ireland during the fifth century.\n\nAccording to legend, Saint Patrick used the three-leaved shamrock as a metaphor for the Holy Trinity when he was first introducing Christianity to Ireland. The story goes that he drove the pagan snakes out of Ireland, which is why there are no snakes in Ireland.\n\nBut the truth behind the legend is far from clear. There are no stories about snakes in Ireland before the Middle Ages, according to the Journal of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland. There are also no stories of Saint Patrick banishing snakes from the island. In fact, the story about Saint Patrick driving the snakes out of Ireland was not recorded until the ninth century, about 1,200 years after his death.\n\nThe only possible origin for the snake story is an ancient Celtic legend about the druid, Mogh Ruith. In this story, Mogh Ruith was a sorcerer who learned dark magic from a demon. In order to protect the people of Ireland from his evil, Mogh Ruith turned the demon into a snake. The demon then slithered into the ocean and encircled the entire island of Ireland, biting the land in anger. Saint Patrick, in this story, was able to drive the snake into the sea.\n\nSo, the truth behind the legend is that there are no snakes in Ireland because there never were any. The legend of Saint Patrick banishing all the snakes from Ireland is likely a metaphor for Christian genocide against the pagans who populated the island."}

{"text":"\nDuring the Golden Age of Piracy, if two pirate ships were to come across each other on the open sea, there was a good chance that they would be friendly to each other. This was because there was a certain code of conduct among pirates that they would not attack each other. This code of conduct was known as the \"Pirate's Code\". The Pirate's Code stated that pirates would not attack each other, and would instead help each other out whenever possible. This code of conduct helped to ensure that there was a certain level of cooperation and trust among pirates. However, there were times when the Pirate's Code was broken. If a pirate ship was attacked, or if a pirate ship was in need of supplies, the other pirate ships would not hesitate to attack or rob the other ship. In these cases, the Pirate's Code was simply a set of guidelines, and the pirates would do whatever was necessary to ensure their own survival.

The findings, based on an analysis of the genomes of 901 people who lived between 1500 and 1800, overturn the long-held view that eunuchs were the product of a single society's influence spreading by cultural diffusion. Instead, eunuchs seem to have arisen independently as a way to fill specific political and religious roles. The study found no evidence of a single eunuch origin. Instead, eunuchs' roots traced to West Asia, South Asia, East Asia, and East Africa. The practice of creating eunuchs may date back to the Assyrians or the Shang Dynasty, which ruled China from 1600 to 1046 B.C.E. The spread of Islam beginning in the seventh century C.E. also helped eunuchs gain power. Castration was seen as a way to ensure the loyalty of trusted officials."}

In the 19th century, Switzerland sought to avoid the ravages of war by staying out of the conflicts that racked Europe, from the Napoleonic era through World War I.\n\nSwitzerland's modern neutrality dates from the aftermath of World War II. When the war ended, the country's leaders decided that the best way to ensure its security was to remain neutral in the Cold War that had begun to develop between the United States and the Soviet Union. This stance was a major irritant to the U.S., which saw Switzerland's banks as a haven for assets that could be used by Germany's former rulers. In the late 1950s, Washington pressured Switzerland not to sell war materials to Egypt, which was at odds with the U.S. over the Suez Canal.

{"text":"\n\nAlthough making out is a very modern term, people have been doing it since the beginning of time. In the colonial period, people courted, which meant they got to know each other well. Courtship was a very serious business. Couples spent much time talking to each other, either in person or by letter. They would exchange books and play music together. Both the man and woman had to be of marriageable age, which was usually around 18. Courtship might last a few months or several years. In the 1700s, it was common for couples to marry in their early 20s.\n\nCourtship was a very private matter, and families were very protective of their daughters. The Puritans frowned upon couples who were too open with their affections. A man who showed too much attention to a woman before marriage was called a fortune hunter. It was also considered improper for men and women to dance together. When they did dance, they were not supposed to touch each other. Courtship in colonial times was complicated.\n\nThere were not a lot of places for young couples to go to be alone. They would often meet in the home of a relative or a friend of the family. Going for a walk together was another popular activity. Sometimes the couple would sit on a bench or on the grass. Holding hands or stealing a kiss were signs that a couple was becoming serious. Even though courtship was very restrained, people were able to find ways to express their love for each other."}
{"text":"\nThe British Empire was famously informal in many regards. Although there were set patterns and precedents for addressing people of different ranks, the peerage was in some ways more a social institution than a legal or administrative one. For example, the eldest sons of peers could be raised to the peerage as a matter of course, but there was no law or regulation that determined whether a colonial governor or ruler should be granted the same style and precedence as a British earl. In general, it was the practice to grant the same styles and precedence to colonial governors and rajahs as they would have held in the United Kingdom, so that a rajah would take precedence over a British earl, and a British governor would take precedence over a British earl. This was not always the case, however, and there were many exceptions to the rule."}

{"text":"\n\nThe growing problems surrounding slavery is the main reason why politics became less stable. The economic, social and political interests were so deeply entangled with slavery that many politicians could not address the problem objectively. This issue affected the stability of federal politics and the country as a whole. There were many reasons why politicians could not address this issue objectively. First of all, the Constitution protected slavery. Secondly, many of the politicians were slaveholders themselves. Finally, the cotton industry was too important for the country's economy. The instability of federal politics and the lack of a strong leader allowed the slavery issue to grow out of control. It is hard to say which of these reasons was the main one. Probably all of them played their role."}

{"text":"\n\nIn the Viking Age, the average life expectancy for men was around 40 years old. Women lived longer, around 42 years old. This means that 13 was indeed quite young. At the same time, it is worth remembering that the average height of a Viking man was around 5'7\" (1.7 meters), so 13-year-olds were considered adults. It is likely that 13-year-old Vikings were considered too young to join raiding parties, but they were old enough to be trained in weapon use and were probably expected to fight in battles when called upon. \n\nThe case of Olaf is unusual but not unheard of. There are several examples of children commanding armies or fleets in the Viking Age. A particularly famous example is the 11-year-old Norwegian king Magnus the Good, who led an army to victory against the Danish king Erik Klipping in 1035. It is worth noting that the sagas that tell these stories were written several centuries after the events they describe, so it is difficult to know how accurate they are. \n\nIt is clear, however, that young commanders were not unheard of in the Viking Age. It is possible that children were given command positions because of their family connections, as was the case with Olaf. It is also possible that these young commanders were seen as having certain qualities that made them suited for leadership, such as courage, intelligence, and charisma. \n\nWhatever the reasons, it is clear that children were not excluded from leadership roles in the Viking Age. It is worth remembering, however, that the average life expectancy was much lower than it is today, so 13-year-olds were considered adults and were expected to take on adult responsibilities."}
{"text":"\n\nIn some ways, yes. For example, Native Americans had dogs before the arrival of Columbus. And they got them from Asia.\n\nWhen the first humans came to North America, they would have been part of a great wave of migration that was happening all over the world. Different groups of people were moving everywhere, and they were probably in contact with one another.\n\nFor example, Native American people in California probably had contact with people in Asia and possibly even Africa. This is because people could have traveled between North and South America by boat. And there is evidence that ancient Egyptians and Phoenicians (people who lived in what is now Lebanon) traveled to North America.\n\nOn the other hand, Native Americans probably did not know that people lived on other continents. This was because they had no way of traveling far across the oceans. And even if they had the means to travel far across the ocean, they probably would not have done so anyway."}
{"text":"\n\nThe training of medieval war horses was a long and arduous process. A great deal of time was needed to train a horse to be obedient and responsive to the rider's commands, and to be able to perform in combat. For this reason, many medieval knights began training horses as soon as they were able to ride. Training would continue throughout the horse's life, as a horse's training must be maintained through regular practice.\n\nThe first step in the training process was to teach the horse to accept a rider. This was often accomplished by breaking the horse, a process in which the horse was taught to be submissive to a human. This was not always a pleasant experience for the horse, and some horses resisted the process. Once a horse was broken, however, it could be trained to be ridden.\n\nThe next step was to teach the horse to be responsive to the rider's commands. This involved teaching the horse to move forward, turn, and stop on command. It also involved teaching the horse to be responsive to the various aids, such as the bit, the reins, and the rider's legs. The goal was to have the horse perform as an extension of the rider's body, moving in perfect harmony with the rider's commands.\n\nOnce a horse was trained to be ridden, it could be trained for combat. The goal of this training was to make the horse as intimidating as possible to the enemy. This often involved teaching the horse to rear, to kick, and to bite. It also involved teaching the horse to be aggressive toward the enemy, and to be willing to charge into the midst of a battle.\n\nOverall, the training of medieval war horses was a long and difficult process. It involved teaching the horse to be obedient and responsive to the rider's commands, and to be able to perform in combat. It also involved teaching the horse to be intimidating to the enemy, and to be willing to charge into battle."}
{"text":"\n\nThe Cold War created a number of flashpoints between the United States and the Soviet Union, but few areas were as tense as the Bering Strait. Located between Russia and Alaska, the Bering Strait is just 54 kilometers (33 miles) wide at its narrowest point. For decades, the two superpowers eyed each other across the Strait, which separates the United States and Russia by only 90 kilometers (56 miles). The Bering Strait thus became a key strategic point during the Cold War. The Soviet Union established several military bases on the Siberian side of the Strait, while the United States built a series of early warning radar stations on the Alaskan side. In the event of a war between the two superpowers, control of the Bering Strait would have been essential for both sides.\n\nThe Soviets developed a series of plans to take over Alaska, and in the late 1940s, they began flying regular surveillance missions over the Bering Strait. These flights continued until the early 1960s, and they often resulted in dangerous confrontations with U.S. military planes. In one such incident, a U.S. Air Force pilot shot down a Soviet bomber that had crossed over the international date line. The Bering Strait thus became a key strategic point during the Cold War. The Soviets established several military bases on the Siberian side of the Strait, while the United States built a series of early warning radar stations on the Alaskan side."}

The Tokugawa Shogunate had been in power since 1603 and had little interest in exploring beyond its borders. The Japanese believed that their culture was superior to any other and that it was their duty to rule over all other nations.\n\nThe only contact the Japanese had with the outside world was through a small group of Dutch traders who were allowed to live on an island off the coast of Nagasaki. These traders were strictly controlled by the Shogunate and were not allowed to leave the island. The Dutch were not permitted to interact with the Japanese and were only allowed to trade with them through a series of windows that were built into the walls of the island.\n\nWhen Commodore Perry arrived in Japan, he was shocked by the level of isolation that the Japanese had achieved. He was even more surprised when he discovered that the Japanese were completely unaware of the existence of the United States. Perry was able to use this ignorance to his advantage and was able to negotiate a treaty with the Japanese that opened up trade between the two countries."}

When the Civil War broke out, the Five Civilized Tribes allied with the Confederacy. The U.S. government considered freeing the slaves and enlisting them in the Union army, but it ultimately decided to ally with the Choctaw and Chickasaw, who had been traditional enemies of the Creek and Seminole. The federal government also feared that the other tribes would ally with the Confederacy if their slaves were freed. The Chickasaw and Choctaw allied with the Union, and their slaves were freed. They also brought their African American slaves with them to Oklahoma, as they were not prepared to leave their former slaves in the hands of the Confederacy. The Creek and Seminole were much harder to convince. They finally agreed to emancipate their slaves only if they could be brought along to Oklahoma.\n\nThe Chickasaw and Choctaw were the first Native Americans to be forced to move west. Their journey, known as the Trail of Tears, began in 1837 and resulted in the deaths of about half of their 16,000 people. The Creek and Seminole followed in 1838."}
{"text":"\nLife expectancy at birth in Japan today is 84.2 years, the highest in the world. Japan has maintained this lead for more than two decades. What explains Japan's success in achieving high life expectancy? The reasons are related to poverty, health, and nutrition. Japan is one of the world's richest countries, with a per capita income of around $40,000. It also has a low poverty rate of around 14 percent of the population. Rich countries tend to have higher life expectancy than poor countries. Japan is also one of the healthiest societies in the world. For example, it has a low obesity rate, perhaps the lowest in the developed world. Obesity is a major risk factor for many diseases, including diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. Around 3 percent of Japanese have diabetes, compared to around 8 percent in the United States. Smoking and heavy drinking are also much less common in Japan than in the United States.\n\nIn the mid-19th century, Japan's life expectancy was around 30 years, similar to other countries in the world at that time. Japan was a very poor country then, with around 50 percent of the population living in extreme poverty. Average height was also very low, even by 19th century standards. Nutrition was a major problem in Japan. An 1887 study found that the average diet consisted of around 70 percent rice, not enough protein, and too much sugar. In the late 19th century, Japan became a much richer country. It also experienced a nutrition transition, as the country became richer, people started to eat more meat, dairy, and fat. Average height increased by several inches. Life expectancy increased to around 50 years by the early 20th century.\n\nHowever, life expectancy in Japan was still lower than in other rich countries in the early 20th century. For example, average life expectancy in the United States was around 53 years in 1920, while in Japan it was around 38 years. One reason for this was a high infant mortality rate. In the early 20th century, many children in Japan died from diarrhea and other diseases related to poor sanitation."}

The points were based on a number of factors, including time in service, combat experience, and decorations. The higher a soldier's score, the more likely they were to be able to return home.

{"text":"\nJesuits were founded in 1534 by Ignatius of Loyola, a Basque nobleman and hermit. Unlike the Franciscans, Dominicans, and Benedictines, the Jesuits were not founded to reform a particular monastic order but to be an order in its own right. The Jesuits' original purpose was to be missionaries and educators. They were dedicated to personal sanctification and apostolic service, and they were not subject to the local bishop. This last part made them very attractive to the Holy See, which had long sought to have a reliable corps of papal diplomats who were directly subject to the Pope. The Jesuits were very successful in their educational and missionary work, and they soon aroused jealousies and fears among other orders and from the secular clergy. The order's insistence on personal poverty, uncompromising dedication to the Pope, and perceived intellectual arrogance were particularly resented. The jealousies and fears reached a climax in the 17th century, when Pope Innocent XI forbade the creation of any new religious orders. The Jesuits were the only exception, and in gratitude the Pope exempted them from the jurisdiction of the local bishops. This meant that Jesuits could be sent on any mission anywhere in the world without the permission of the local bishop. This made the Jesuits hated by bishops and secular clergy."}

It was a very rare occurrence in the Vietnam War. According to the Vietnam War Fragging Database, there were between 1,051 and 1,500 fragging incidents during the Vietnam War.\n\nThere are a number of reasons why fragging was so rare. First, the Vietnam War was a very unpopular war, and many soldiers were opposed to it. Second, fragging was a very risky act, as it would have been very difficult to get away with. Third, the United States military had a very strong code of conduct, and fragging was a very serious offense. Finally, the North Vietnamese army had a very strong code of conduct, and fragging was a very serious offense.\n\nIn conclusion, fragging was a very rare occurrence in the Vietnam War.

{"text":"\nProhibition was repealed by the 21st Amendment to the Constitution, which was ratified on December 5, 1933. However, it was not until April 1, 1934 that the federal government actually stopped enforcing the 18th Amendment. Liquor could once again be manufactured and sold legally in the United States, but only after it had been de-alcoholized. That meant that the country had to wait for all the alcohol that had been made, or imported, during Prohibition to be used up before legal sales could begin. So, for the first few months after Repeal, there was still no legal liquor available.\n\nAfter Repeal, federal prisoners were gradually released from federal prisons and the federal prison on Alcatraz Island was shut down. State prisons were also affected by Repeal, but the process varied from state to state. In some states, prisoners were immediately released. In other states, such as Utah, inmates were required to serve their full sentences. Some states continued to enforce state Prohibition laws even after the federal Prohibition law was repealed.\n\nThere was one final, unexpected consequence of Repeal. The federal Prohibition Bureau was officially dissolved, and its agents were out of work. Some of them went on to have successful careers in law enforcement, and the Prohibition era was romanticized in countless books and movies. However, the vast majority of Prohibition agents never worked in law enforcement again."}

Uruguay is the only country in South America to be classified by the Economist Intelligence Unit as a full democracy. The Democracy Index ranks Uruguay as the most democratic country in South America. How did Uruguay achieve this?\n\nFirst, the country has a long tradition of respect for the rule of law and for the rights of the individual. The constitution of Uruguay was adopted in 1830, and it has been amended only once since then. The constitution guarantees the right to freedom of speech, of the press, and of religion. It also provides for a system of checks and balances between the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government.\n\nSecond, the political system in Uruguay is characterized by a high degree of political participation. The country has a long history of free and fair elections. Voting is compulsory, and turnout is typically high. The political parties in Uruguay are relatively weak, and the political system is dominated by individual politicians and political personalities.\n\nThird, the economy in Uruguay is relatively stable. The country has a strong agricultural sector, and it has been relatively successful in diversifying its economy. Uruguay has a small, open economy, and it has been able to weather the recent economic crisis better than many other countries in South America.\n\nIn summary, the democracy in Uruguay is characterized by a long tradition of respect for the rule of law, a high degree of political participation, and a relatively stable economy.

{"text":"\nAlgeria was made an integral part of France unlike other African possessions of France because of the long-term presence of French settlers in Algeria, their close economic ties to France, and the military importance of Algeria to France.\n\nFrance colonized Algeria in 1830, and Algeria became an integral part of France in 1848. Algeria was unique among France's African colonies in that it had a large population of French settlers, who were known as pieds-noirs (\"black feet\"). The pieds-noirs were mainly of French and Italian origin, and they had settled in Algeria since the 18th century. They were granted French citizenship in 1848 and they played a significant role in the economy and society of Algeria.\n\nIn addition to the pieds-noirs, Algeria was also home to a large number of European settlers from other countries, including Spain, Belgium, and Germany. These settlers were also granted French citizenship in 1848.\n\nThe economy of Algeria was closely tied to France. Algeria was a major producer of wheat and wine, and these products were sold to France. In addition, Algeria was a significant market for French goods.\n\nFinally, Algeria was militarily important to France. It was a key base for the French Navy, and it also played a role in the French conquest of Morocco in 1844.\n\nOverall, the long-term presence of French settlers, the close economic ties between France and Algeria, and the military importance of Algeria to France all contributed to the decision to make Algeria an integral part of France, unlike other African possessions of France."}

While the army itself was generally well-equipped and well-supplied, its rigid organization and tactics made it unsuited for the demands of the First World War. The Russian army was organized into separate armies (the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Armies, etc.), each with its own commander, staff, and supporting units. This made it difficult to coordinate the movements of the various armies, and also led to a lack of coordination between the different branches of the army (e.g. infantry, cavalry, artillery). In addition, the Russian army was still using the outdated equipment of the nineteenth century, such as the M1891 Mosin-Nagant rifle and the M1902 bayonet.

A lot of the time, these types of adventurers would do jobs that were odd or unusual. For example, they might be hired to find someone who was lost, or to hunt down a ghost.

{"text":"\n\nIn relation to the so-called \"African crisis\" of the 1960s, when newly independent African states demanded the return of cultural artifacts and human remains taken by European powers during the colonial period, it is instructive to recall that the great majority of British and French scholars did not consider these things to be objects of study. This is not to say that they thought the objects were worthless, but only that they were not deemed important enough to be the subject of academic study. In other words, these objects were not seen as integral to the story of world history, or even of European history.\n\nIn this sense, the history of the British Empire in the early 20th century is a history of forgetting. Most British scholars did not envision their African and Indian holdings to be kept forever, but rather as things to be used in the present and, ultimately, discarded.

Flintlock pistols were difficult to maintain in the damp marine environment, and matchlock pistols were banned in the 16th century as too dangerous for civilians. Pirates also favored close-quarter weapons, and boarding axes and cutlasses would be more effective in a melee than a gun.\n\nNevertheless, pistols were occasionally used by pirates, and a few even carried them as their primary weapon. Edward Teach, better known as Blackbeard, was one of the most infamous pirates of the Golden Age of Piracy. He was known for his cruelty and ruthlessness, and he was said to have sometimes lit fuses in his beard and worn pistols in his belt.\n\nPistol wounds were not necessarily fatal, but they were often severe. The surgeon's job was to clean and bandage the wound and administer appropriate medicines, but there was little they could do for a gunshot wound. A pistol ball could shatter a bone or cause severe internal bleeding, and the victim was often beyond help.\n\nIn the late 17th century, the average lifespan of a pirate was only about two years. This was due in part to the high rate of injury and death in battle, but also to the fact that many pirates were suffering from diseases such as scurvy and dysentery. Many pirates died of their wounds or illnesses while being cared for by the ship's surgeon."}

The reader is also told that the creature is incredibly intelligent, but he is never allowed to demonstrate this intelligence, at least not in a way that would lead the reader to sympathize with him. Indeed, he is only ever allowed to show his intelligence in the service of his monstrosity. For example, when he learns to speak, the first words he learns are how to curse at his creator, which only inspires further hatred in those who hear him. The creature is, however, permitted one soliloquy near the end of the novel in which he expresses his despair and his intention to kill himself. This speech is moving and eloquent, but it is also the last speech the creature is allowed. He is prevented from killing himself by the intervention of nature, in the form of a lightning storm, and is immediately afterward attacked by the people he had been living with. Thus the creature is allowed to demonstrate his intelligence only in a way that inspires horror and disgust, not sympathy. The creature's intelligence is consistently portrayed as a source of danger and horror, never of understanding. This portrayal is accomplished in part by a literary device of presenting the creature's intelligence only in his thoughts, never in his speech.

Slaves learned of the Underground Railroad through a variety of means, including word of mouth, abolitionist literature, and coded messages in songs.\n\nTo participate in the Underground Railroad, slaves would typically need to make contact with an abolitionist or sympathetic white person, who would then help them plan their escape. Escapes were often planned and executed in secret, and slaves would often travel at night and hide during the day. The routes and safe houses used by the Underground Railroad were typically operated by abolitionists and free blacks, and were often located in secluded areas such as forests or swamps.\n\nThe Underground Railroad was not without risk, and slaves who attempted to escape could be captured and punished.

It was the first truly transnational corporation, with facilities and agents in Asia, Europe, and the New World. And it was phenomenally profitable.

The English East India Company, for example, was better capitalized and more efficiently run. The French East India Company was more aggressive and more inclined to take risks. The Portuguese East India Company had more experience in Asia and a longer track record of success.

Only a small percentage of the population in most Asian countries practices Christianity. The Philippines is the only country in Asia that has a significant percentage of Catholics. Other countries such as South Korea and Singapore have Christian minorities. There are various reasons why Christianity has not spread throughout Asia as it has in other parts of the world.\n\nOne reason is that Christianity is a Western religion, and Asians have been more receptive to other religious traditions, such as Buddhism, Hinduism, and Islam. These religions have a long history in Asia, and they are more closely tied to the cultural and social traditions of the region. Another reason is that Christianity has been suppressed in some parts of Asia. For example, in China, the Communist government has strictly controlled religious practice, and the number of Christians in the country is very small. In other countries, such as Saudi Arabia, the practice of Christianity is completely forbidden.\n\nFinally, there are also demographic reasons why Christianity is not as widespread in Asia as it is in other parts of the world. The population of Asia is much larger than that of the West, and the majority of people in the region are not Christians. In addition, many Asian countries are less developed than Western countries, and there is often a greater focus on economic and social issues than on religious practice."}

{"text":"\nThe Russian and French revolutions certainly shook up the existing order, including the question of debt. In both cases, the debt was basically wiped out: in Russia, the Bolsheviks repudiated the debts of the Czarist regime, and in France, the revolutionaries decided to wipe the slate clean and start over. But both cases were very different from the modern sovereign debt crises we see today.\n\nThe first difference is that the debts repudiated in Russia and France were not owed to private creditors, but to other states. The French and Russian Revolutions were in part about overthrowing the existing order, which included the idea that a hereditary monarchy was entitled to rule over other states and extract tribute from them. The revolutionaries in both countries wanted to replace this international order with a new one, based on the principles of national self-determination and popular sovereignty. And one way to do this was to repudiate the debts that the old regimes had incurred on behalf of the nation.\n\nThe second difference is that the debts repudiated in Russia and France were not very large. The Russian and French monarchies had borrowed a lot of money from other states, but the amounts were not particularly significant in comparison to the size of their economies. In fact, the Russian and French economies were much larger than their debts, which made it easy for the revolutionaries to simply write them off.\n\nToday's sovereign debt crises are very different from those of the French and Russian Revolutions. They are not about overthrowing the existing international order, and they are not about small amounts of debt. On the contrary, they are about very large amounts of debt, owed to private creditors. And the reason why these debts are so large is because the countries involved have been able to borrow a lot of money from private creditors.\n\nThis is a new development in the history of sovereign debt. Until the late 20th century, most countries were not able to borrow large amounts of money from private creditors. They were limited to borrowing from other states, or from international organizations like the World Bank. But since the 1980s, many countries have been able to borrow large sums from private creditors. And this has led to a situation where the debts of some countries have become very large in relation to their economies.\n\nSo the modern sovereign debt crises are very different from those of the French and Russian Revolutions.

For example, very often, the rich wanted to look their best, so they asked artists to make them slimmer. Sometimes, the opposite was true, and the painters were asked to depict their sitters as bigger than they were. It is well known that throughout the history of art, painters have used various \"tricks\" to change the appearance of their sitters.

However, it is well known that members of the royal family and the nobility expected to be painted with certain symbols of their power, such as crowns and scepters. For example, in the 15th century, the Hapsburg Emperor Maximilian I (r. 1493-1519) commissioned the famous portrait of himself and his family by Albrecht D\u00fcrer (1471-1528). In this group portrait, the Emperor and his family are depicted in a very unusual way. First of all, they are shown from a very low point of view, which makes them look bigger than they really were. In addition, the figures are placed in a very strange way. The Emperor is in the center, and his family members are placed around him in a very hierarchical order. The eldest son, Philip, is on the left. His wife, Joanna of Castile, is next to him. On the right, we see the second son, Ferdinand, and his wife, Anna of Saxony. Finally, the third son, Maximilian, is standing on the right of his father. This group portrait is a very good example of how the members of the royal family wanted to be depicted. They were not interested in how they really looked. They wanted to be shown as bigger and more important than they really were."}

{"text":"\n\nDuring the Joseon Dynasty, which lasted for over 500 years, Korea had a highly centralized culture. The Joseon government forbade its people from traveling abroad, and it also discouraged foreign influence. In fact, for much of its history, the country had only two formal relationships with the outside world: China and Japan. \n\nUnder Japanese rule from 1910 to 1945, Koreans were forbidden to speak their own language. They were also pressured to adopt Japanese names and to shave their hair in the Japanese style. Colonial authorities also tried to eradicate traditional Korean culture. This included the promotion of Japanese holidays, the adoption of Japanese names for Korean cities, and the destruction of Korean literature and art.\n\nWhen Japan surrendered to the Allies in 1945, the Korean Peninsula was divided along the 38th parallel. The United States occupied the area south of the line, and the Soviet Union occupied the area to its north. The two Cold War rivals then established governments in their respective zones. In 1948, the United States and the Soviet Union set up a trusteeship that was supposed to lead to Korean independence. However, in the following year, two separate states emerged: the Republic of Korea in the south, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in the north.\n\nWhile both countries were initially ruled by authoritarian leaders, they developed different cultures. In South Korea, the government promoted a Western-style democracy and a market economy. In contrast, North Korea became a Stalinist dictatorship. Its citizens were taught to worship their leader, Kim Il Sung, and the Kim family that succeeded him. The country also developed its own brand of Korean socialism.\n\nSince the Korean War, the two countries have remained officially at war with each other. In the decades after the war, South Korea achieved rapid economic growth and is now considered an advanced industrial economy. It has also become a regional power. By contrast, North Korea has maintained a command economy and remains one of the world's poorest countries. It also continues to face international sanctions for its nuclear weapons program and human rights abuses."}

{"text":"\nThe video you saw was likely of someone doing something dangerous, and it is not a good idea to try this at home. Chloroform is a simple chemical compound in which each chlorine atom is attached to one carbon atom. Chloroform is a liquid at room temperature and pressure. It is a sweet-smelling, colorless, and slightly oily substance. It is quite flammable. Chloroform is not very reactive, but it does dissolve easily in water and most organic solvents. Chloroform is best known for its use as a general anesthetic. Anesthetics are substances that are used to prevent pain. Chloroform is one of the oldest anesthetics still in use. When chloroform was first discovered in the 19th century, its sweet smell led to its use as a flavoring agent in cough medicines and other products. But soon it was discovered that chloroform was more useful for putting people to sleep. When chloroform is inhaled, it travels to the lungs, where it is absorbed into the blood and travels to the brain. In the brain, chloroform inhibits an enzyme called acetylcholinesterase, which breaks down a neurotransmitter called acetylcholine. Acetylcholine is important for muscle movement, learning and memory, and many other processes in the brain. By inhibiting the breakdown of acetylcholine, chloroform causes acetylcholine to build up between the nerve cells, which results in anesthesia (lack of sensation) and even temporary paralysis. Chloroform also affects the central nervous system, resulting in a loss of consciousness. When chloroform was first used as an anesthetic, it was administered by holding a cloth soaked in chloroform over the patient\u2019s face. But it was soon discovered that chloroform could be lethal if given in too high a dose. Nowadays, chloroform is rarely used on its own. Instead, it is used in combination with other anesthetics, particularly with an inhaled anesthetic called sevoflurane. Chloroform was also once used as a solvent, because it can dissolve many other substances. However, it is no longer used as a solvent because it is toxic and has been replaced by other substances, such as dichloromethane."}
{"text":"\n\nThe lifespan of a species can be influenced by many different factors. One of the most important is the environment in which the species lives. For example, some species that live in very cold climates have longer lifespans than species that live in warmer climates. This is because the colder climate requires the species to use more energy to stay warm, which can slow down the aging process.\n\nAnother factor that can influence the lifespan of a species is the type of food that it eats. Some species that eat a diet that is high in nutrients and low in toxins can have longer lifespans than species that eat a diet that is less healthy. This is because the nutrients can help to protect the cells from damage, while the lack of toxins can reduce the amount of stress on the body.\n\nFinally, the lifespan of a species can also be influenced by its genes. Some species have genes that are better able to repair DNA damage, which can slow down the aging process. In addition, some species have genes that are more resistant to disease, which can also increase their lifespan.\n\nThe reason that humans have a longer lifespan than housecats is likely due to a combination of all of these factors. Humans have a relatively long lifespan compared to other species because we have evolved to live in a variety of different environments, we have access to a diverse diet, and we have genes that are well-suited for longevity."}

Scientifically, we need to learn how to confine and control a plasma of deuterium and tritium (another form of hydrogen) at 100 million degrees. Engineering-wise, we need to figure out how to harness the energy that's released when atoms are combined, fusing into a single, heavier nucleus. There are also economic and political obstacles to the development of fusion power. The research and development involved is extremely expensive, and it would be hard to get the world's governments to cooperate on a huge international project.\n\nThe scientific challenges are the most daunting. We need to learn to control matter at very high temperatures, something we've never done before. And we have to figure out a way to sustain a fusion reaction, which is very difficult.

These muscles are very similar to our own, with linear sequences of sarcomeres connected end-to-end by a thin transverse band called a Z-disc. This band contains titin, which is responsible for the passive elasticity of the sarcomere. The muscles of the abdomen, on the other hand, are formed differently. Here, the sarcomeres are connected by a belt of connective tissue called a sclerite, which provides a solid anchor for the muscle to pull against. The sclerites are arranged in parallel, like the threads of a screw, and this arrangement allows the abdomen to expand and contract in a more controlled and powerful way.

{"text":"\nThe choice of green is mostly historical: \n\nEarly special-effects films, such as The Matrix, often used blue screens.

The film-makers used a turquoise screen instead of blue, because the costume of the main character, Dorothy, was turquoise. \n\nBut by the time The Matrix was made in 1999, digital film-making was more common. The makers of The Matrix could choose any colour screen they wanted, so they chose green instead of blue. \n\nGreen is not necessarily better than blue.

{"text":"\n\nA giraffe's long neck may serve as a lightning rod, attracting bolts that would otherwise strike the body, according to new research. The finding, presented December 14 at the American Geophysical Union meeting, helps explain how these herbivores can survive in the African savanna, where dangerous storms are common.\n\nThe idea that a giraffe's height or neck might protect it from lightning has been around since the animal's discovery in the late 17th century, says Nikolai Kremen, an ecologist at the University of Copenhagen. But he and his colleagues were the first to test the theory.\n\nUsing camera traps, the team recorded every lightning strike within a 50-kilometer radius of the Somalisa Expeditions Camp in Zimbabwe from March 2016 to March 2017. When the researchers tallied the number of strikes that occurred within a kilometer of the camp, they found that there were fewer strikes closer to the camp than farther away. And the number of strikes close to the camp correlated with the number of tall, long-necked giraffes in the area.\n\nWhen the researchers looked at individual giraffes, they found that those that had been struck tended to be younger than giraffes that hadn't. That finding suggests that, as giraffes age, they learn to avoid lightning, says Kremen.\n\nThe researchers also measured the ambient temperature of each strike. They found that strikes close to the camp were, on average, 2 degrees Celsius hotter than strikes farther away. That difference suggests that the air close to the camp had recently been compressed, as happens when a lightning bolt travels through the air. And the researchers calculated that a giraffe's neck would need to be about 20 percent longer than it is to attract lightning strikes.\n\n\"The reason why giraffes evolved to be tall is likely because it helps them to forage,\" says Kremen. But the new findings suggest that height and neck length may have also helped giraffes to survive in a dangerous environment.\n\nYes, giraffes do get struck by lightning more often than other animals. This is because their long necks serve as lightning rods, attracting bolts that would otherwise strike the body. The findings suggest that as giraffes age, they learn to avoid lightning, and that their height and neck length may have helped them to survive in a dangerous environment."}

The storage of memories occurs when the information is transferred from the hippocampus to the prefrontal cortex. The retrieval of memories occurs when the information is retrieved from the prefrontal cortex and sent to the amygdala, which triggers the emotions associated with the memory.\n\nAs we age, our brains begin to lose their ability to create new memories and to retrieve old ones.

{"text":"\nThe Moon's gravity pulls the ocean towards it, causing a bulge. As the Earth rotates, this bulge will also rotate, creating a high tide on the sides of the Earth that are facing the Moon and a low tide on the sides of the Earth that are away from the Moon. Since the water is not completely rigid, high tide will flow to the areas where the water is low, and these flows of water are what we know as tides. \n\nWe extract energy from tides when we generate electricity from the flow of water. In this case, we are not extracting energy from the tides themselves, but rather from the flows of water that they create. As such, the water flows that we extract energy from are not slowed down by the extraction of energy. \n\nThe Earth and the Moon do not exchange energy with each other. The Earth's rotation speed is not affected by the Moon's gravity, nor is the Moon's orbit affected by the Earth's rotation. This is because the Earth and the Moon are already moving in relation to each other at the moment that the Moon's gravity starts to act on the Earth. If this were not the case, the Earth would start to move towards or away from the Moon, and this would cause a catastrophic collision or an equally catastrophic escape."}
{"text":"\n\nSince we take the honey, bees have to consume more honey (stored energy) to keep the hive at a warm temperature for the brood (eggs\/babies). This requires more bees, thus more honey. In a cold winter, the bees will cluster together for warmth. In this position, they'll eat their stored honey to generate heat to keep the queen and brood warm. If the queen bee dies, worker bees will create an emergency queen. This process of creating a queen takes a lot of energy and requires a lot of honey. This is why you don't want to stress your hive in the spring and summer. The more stressed they are, the more honey they'll consume.\n\nSo, to answer your question, if we didn't take their honey, the hive would probably get larger, but the bees would consume more honey and work themselves to death. If you don't take their honey, they will swarm, which is not good. This is why it is essential to harvest the honey and leave enough for the bees to get through the winter."}
{"text":"\n\nLenses \"bend\" or refract light, focusing the rays on a single point. This is similar to the way a magnifying glass works. Because of this refraction, the image appears to be upside down. That's why photographers put a prism in the lens to flip the image back to normal.\n\nThe image is also inverted left to right. A mechanism called a mirror box or flipping mirror quickly flips the image back so it's right-side up.\n\nFinally, the image is also larger than the sensor. Lenses can focus at only one distance. So if you want to take a picture of something nearby, you have to move the lens closer to the sensor. This narrows the lens opening, or aperture, which decreases the amount of light that hits the sensor. The result is a darker image.\n\nTo fix this, modern cameras have a piece of glass with a group of blades in the middle. As you adjust the aperture, the blades move and let in different amounts of light. This allows you to control the brightness of the image."}

{"text":"\nWhen you shine a flashlight in space, the photons of light that it emits will travel in a straight line. This is because light does not interact with matter very strongly, and it is not affected by gravity. The light will not be able to propel itself forward, because it does not have any way to generate thrust. However, if you were to point the flashlight in a particular direction, the light it emitted would be able to push on the flashlight and cause it to move in that direction. This is similar to how a rocket works: it uses the exhaust from its engines to push on the rocket, which causes it to move in the opposite direction. It is important to note that, while light can push on matter, it cannot do so very strongly. This means that it would take a very long time for a flashlight to accelerate to significant speeds using this method."}

For example, it will be baked at a high temperature to kill any microbial life that might be on it. \n\nHowever, there is a small chance that some Earth microbes might survive on Mars. There is evidence that microbes can survive in space, and Mars has a much thinner atmosphere than Earth, so less of a buffer against hard radiation. If some Earth microbes do hitch a ride on Mars, it is possible that they could survive on Mars, as Mars has water (albeit salty) and an energy source (sunlight). \n\nHowever, the environment on Mars is very harsh for life. The surface of Mars is very cold and dry, and the soil contains perchlorates, which are toxic to life. The environment around the Viking landers was also very sterile.

{"text":"\nWhen we move our eyes, three muscles in our eyes move our eyeballs. Extraocular muscles control eye movement. These muscles are attached to the sclera, the white part of the eye. The front of the eye is covered by a clear tissue called the cornea. The cornea is also flexible, so it can move as the extraocular muscles move the eyeball. The iris, which is the colored part of the eye, is in front of the lens. The iris has muscles that dilate and constrict the pupil. When the pupil dilates, more light can enter the eye. When the pupil constricts, less light can enter the eye.\n\nThe extraocular muscles move the eyeball in a smooth motion, as does the cornea. The iris muscles also allow for smooth, voluntary control of the size of the pupil. However, the eyes do not move smoothly when they scan a visual scene. Instead, they make a series of rapid jumps from one object to another. This jumpiness is called saccades.\n\nDuring each saccade, the eyes briefly pause before moving to the next point in the visual scene. This pause is called a fixation. During a fixation, the eyes are completely still. In fact, the eyes are so still during fixations that they can remain fixed on an object even when our head or body moves. For example, you can maintain fixation on an object even when you turn your head to the side.\n\nThe reason that the eyes move in a series of saccades is that the brain can process images more easily this way. Rather than processing information from the whole visual field, the brain processes information from a small part of the visual field at a time. The brain then integrates these separate images to form a coherent picture of the visual scene.\n\nWhen we scan a visual scene, we are not interested in every detail. Instead, we are interested in certain objects. The brain can direct our attention to these objects by causing the eyes to make saccades. By causing the eyes to move in saccades, the brain can quickly bring relevant objects into the center of the visual field. Once these objects are in the center of the visual field, the eyes remain still for as long as necessary. This allows the brain to process the objects in greater detail.\n\nThe smooth pursuit system is another part of eye movement that differs from the saccadic system. The smooth pursuit system allows the eyes to follow moving objects. For example, if you are driving a car and another car approaches you from the opposite direction, your eyes will automatically move to track the approaching car. The smooth pursuit system is involuntary, which means that it occurs without any conscious effort on your part.\n\nThe saccadic system and the smooth pursuit system work together to allow the eyes to move quickly and accurately. The saccadic system allows the eyes to move rapidly between different points in a visual scene. The smooth pursuit system allows the eyes to follow moving objects. Together, these two systems allow the eyes to move in a coordinated and efficient manner."}

{"text":"\nA black hole is a region of spacetime where the gravitational field is so strong that nothing\u2014not particles, not radiation\u2014can escape from it. Because no light can get out, a black hole is black, so the name. But the matter that forms a black hole is really hot, so hot that it glows. This glow is brighter than the light from all the stars in the universe put together, so bright that it would blind you if you looked at it. But it's invisible, because it's inside the event horizon.\n\nThe glow of a black hole is a theoretical prediction made in the 1970s. It was a key part of the theory that explains how black holes form, how they behave, and what would happen if you fell into one. This theory is called general relativity, and it's the foundation of our modern understanding of gravity. But to make the theory work, you need to include quantum effects. When you do that, you find that a black hole will evaporate, and eventually disappear.\n\nTo take a picture of a black hole, you need to be able to see that glow. But the glow is very dim, and it's buried under a mountain of bright light from the matter that formed the black hole. You need a very sensitive camera, and you need to take a long exposure. If you do that, the glow of the black hole will be blurred into a ring, like a bull's-eye. This is what the Event Horizon Telescope saw.\n\nBut the Event Horizon Telescope is a network of telescopes, and each telescope has its own clock. If you want to combine the data from all the telescopes, you need to figure out how to make them all line up. You need an algorithm to do that. And that's what the Event Horizon Telescope team did. They developed a new algorithm, and they used it to combine the data from all the telescopes. And that's how they took a picture of a black hole."}

The reason it hasn't been fixed is because it's not actually a bug, it's a fundamental problem with the way time is measured. It is not actually possible to fix this problem in the existing applications, only in the underlying operating system kernel. This means that fixing this problem requires changes to a part of the system that is not normally accessible to application programmers.\n\nMost operating systems have already been fixed. Linux patched this in April of 2013, as did FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, and Darwin. Microsoft Windows will not be fixed until sometime in 2017, as they consider it a low-priority bug. Apple iOS and Mac OS X are not fixed as of 2016. Google's Android operating system is also not fixed, and it is unclear if it will be.

Since it is not possible to change the type of time_t used by an existing application, the only solution is to use a different time representation. The most common alternative is to use the time_t integer as a count of seconds since the epoch, and use a separate integer to store the number of nanoseconds since the epoch. This requires changing the API for time_t, which is not possible for existing applications. The alternative is to use a 64-bit time_t, which is large enough that it will not overflow until the year 292 billion. However, this requires changing the type of time_t used by existing applications, which is not possible."}

The Earth's climate is dynamic and influenced by a number of complex factors. The Sun is by far the largest source of energy for our planet, but the Earth's climate has also been profoundly shaped by the history of life on Earth, including the carbon cycle. \n\nAbout 500 million years ago, geological and atmospheric processes resulted in high levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. As a result, the Earth's climate was much warmer than it is today, and there was very little, if any, ice at the poles. The current high level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is a direct result of human activities, mainly the burning of fossil fuels. The enhanced greenhouse effect caused by carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases results in a warmer climate, which is expected to cause major changes to the Earth's climate system.\n\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has concluded that human activities are \"very likely\" the dominant cause of global warming since the mid-20th century. The evidence for this conclusion comes from many different lines of evidence, including the observed increase in global average temperature, the increase in atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases, and the understanding of the mechanisms that link these changes to human activities."}

{"text":"\nFuels have different energy densities. In general, higher energy density is associated with higher cost. For gasoline, the difference in energy density between regular and premium is about 10%, while the difference between regular and diesel is about 40%. The energy density of diesel fuel is generally greater than gasoline, so you get more energy per gallon of diesel fuel, but it costs more. Some engines can only take one or two of these, because they are built to run on just gasoline, or just diesel. It would be very expensive to build an engine that could take multiple kinds of fuel. In general, though, higher energy density is associated with lower cost."}

{"text":"\nA rainbow is an optical phenomenon that is visible when sunlight refracts through water droplets. The refraction of light by raindrops is what causes the colors of the rainbow. Rainbows are not visible in the infrared or ultraviolet spectrum because these wavelengths are not visible to the human eye. However, rainbows do have a section in the visible spectrum, which is the range of wavelengths of light that can be seen by the human eye. The visible spectrum includes the colors red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. Rainbows are only visible in this range because the human eye cannot see wavelengths outside of the visible spectrum. Infrared radiation is characterized by a lower frequency and longer wavelength than visible light, and ultraviolet radiation is characterized by a higher frequency and shorter wavelength than visible light.\n\nThe reason that rainbows are not visible in the infrared or ultraviolet spectrum is that these wavelengths are not refracted by water droplets in the same way that visible light is. In fact, water droplets tend to absorb infrared and ultraviolet radiation, which is why these wavelengths are not visible to the human eye. Infrared and ultraviolet radiation are also not refracted in the same way as visible light because they have different properties. For example, infrared radiation is emitted by objects at a lower temperature, while ultraviolet radiation is emitted by objects at a higher temperature."}
{"text":"\n\nMost atoms have a corresponding maximum number of electrons they can accommodate in their electron shells. The first shells can hold a maximum of two electrons, the second shells can hold a maximum of eight electrons, the third shells can hold a maximum of 18 electrons, and so on. These maximum capacities are not necessarily the same as the number of electrons that are typically found in a given shell. For example, the first shells of most atoms contain only one or two electrons, not a maximum of two. The second shells of atoms typically have between four and eight electrons. The third shells of atoms have between six and 18 electrons. The maximum capacities of the shells increase with the distance from the nucleus because the electrostatic force that binds the electrons to the nucleus in an atom decreases with distance. Therefore, the outermost electron shells have a greater capacity for electrons than the inner shells."}

{"text":"\nFirst of all, we have to define \"water molecule\". A water molecule is H2O, so we're talking about a combination of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. Given that the Earth's atmosphere is (currently) ~78% nitrogen and ~21% oxygen, with the remaining ~1% being a bunch of other gases, including water vapor, there is a very low probability that you have ever consumed the same water molecule twice. A water molecule spends about nine days in the atmosphere. There are a number of processes by which it can leave the atmosphere, but let's say that the average lifespan of a water molecule in the atmosphere is nine days. That means that, on average, a water molecule travels about 3600 km (2237 miles) before it hits the ground. The Earth has a diameter of about 12,700 km (7999 miles), so a water molecule travels about 0.27% of the way around the Earth on average before falling to the ground. And this is just the average; many water molecules travel much farther. Since the Earth is mostly covered in water, the chance that you have ever consumed the same water molecule twice is vanishingly small."}

But it's hard to change someone's mind once they decide they're not interested.\n\nFinally, rejection is painful, so we focus on the positive aspects of the person who rejected us. We don't think about the aspects that might not be so great.\n\nDr. Lewandowski says these reasons help us understand why we idealize people who don't want us. But he says there's a deeper reason.\n\n\"The Cinderella Effect\" explains that we idealize people who don't want us because it helps us maintain our self-esteem. If someone we like doesn't like us back, it's easier to believe it's their loss. We can tell ourselves we're still desirable.\n\nBut there's a problem with this mindset. If we believe the person who rejected us is making a mistake, we're less likely to move on. It's hard to accept that someone we like doesn't like us back. But dwelling on it makes it harder to heal.\n\nIt's also important to remember that rejection isn't always about us. There are many reasons why someone might not be interested. It doesn't mean we're unattractive or unworthy."}

{"text":"\nPlutonium is one of the man-made elements that can be used as a nuclear fuel. The other is Uranium. Plutonium is a byproduct of the nuclear power industry, and is not found in nature. It is created by bombarding Uranium with neutrons in a nuclear reactor. Uranium is found in nature, but it is mostly U238, which can't be used directly to make a nuclear bomb. You have to first convert the U238 into the fissionable U235, which is done by separating out the U235 using a process called enrichment. The Plutonium is easier to use in a nuclear bomb because it is already fissionable (although not all plutonium is created equally. The stuff used in nuclear bombs is Plutonium239, which is bred in special reactors from U238, then separated using a process called reprocessing). The Manhattan Project scientists chose to use Plutonium because it is fissionable by neutrons, and thus doesn't need to be enriched. Thus, they could use a process called implosion to compress a sub-critical sphere of Plutonium239 into a critical mass, which is a fancy way of saying they could make a nuclear bomb using less plutonium. This is how the first atomic bombs were made. Later, when the United States decided to develop a hydrogen bomb, they used Uranium because the neutrons created by the fusion of hydrogen atoms could be used to fission Uranium. This is how modern thermonuclear weapons (or hydrogen bombs) work."}

{"text":"\nThe age of the universe can be calculated from the abundances of helium and other chemical elements in the universe today. The first element to be produced, helium, is an inert gas that does not combine with other atoms. As a result, helium is the only element in the universe that was not created by stars. The first stars that formed after the Big Bang were 100 million times more massive than our Sun. They created heavier elements by fusing hydrogen and helium, and those stars seeded the universe with the heavier elements we see today. By the time our own Sun formed, roughly 9 billion years ago, most of the helium in the universe had already been created. As a result, the abundance of helium in our Sun is lower than the abundance of helium in the universe as a whole. The first stars were so massive that they burned through their hydrogen fuel very quickly, and they spewed their heavier elements into the universe. The first stars also created the helium we see today. By calculating the abundance of helium in the universe today, we can determine how much time must have passed since the first stars formed: helium atoms decayed into hydrogen atoms (a process called alpha decay), and that hydrogen was subsequently re-combined into stars. From the current abundance of helium, we can calculate how long it would have taken to create that much helium: roughly 13.8 billion years. This is the age of the universe we observe today."}

This means that sperm cells that are closer to the opening of the uterus will be impregnated first, while sperm cells that are further away will be impregnated later. Therefore, the probability of impregnation is determined by the swimming speed of individual sperm cells, not the force of ejaculation."}

This means that the salt is leaving your blood stream and going into your cells. This allows the water to flow in and rehydrate your cells."}
{"text":"\n\nNature refers to the way a person was born, including genetics and heredity.\nNurture refers to the way a person is raised, including environment and upbringing.\nNature vs. nurture is the debate of whether human behavior is a product of inherited traits or a result of environmental factors. Twin studies provide evidence for both sides of the debate. Identical twins share 100% of their DNA and fraternal twins share only 50% of their DNA. Identical twins share the same genes, home environment, family, and often the same placenta and amniotic sac. Fraternal twins do not share the same genes, home environment, family, or placenta and amniotic sac. Thus, if identical twins are more alike than fraternal twins in a trait, researchers say that the trait has a hereditary component. If fraternal twins are more alike than identical twins, researchers say that the trait is influenced by the environment. Twin studies also explore how much of a trait is due to genes and how much is due to environment. For example, researchers might study how much variation in height is due to heredity and how much is due to diet."}
{"text":"\n\nThere are several reasons why you may see odd colors or patterns when you rub your eyes. One possibility is that you may have a condition called synesthesia, in which stimulation of one sense can cause you to experience another. For example, if you were to hear a loud noise, you might see a flash of light. In this case, stimulating your eyes with a vigorous rub may cause you to experience a visual sensation, such as seeing colors or patterns.\n\nAnother possibility is that you may have a condition called photopsia, in which light stimuli cause you to see flashes of light. This condition can be caused by a variety of things, such as a detached retina or a problem with the way your eyes process light. If you were to rub your eyes hard enough, it's possible that you might stimulate the retina in a way that causes you to see flashes of light.\n\nFinally, it's also possible that you may have a condition called phosphene, in which stimulation of the eyes causes you to see patterns or shapes.

{"text":"\n\nThe Earth's magnetic field is generated by the motion of the Earth's iron core. The core is made up of two parts: the solid inner core, which is about 1,500 miles (2,400 km) in diameter, and the liquid outer core, which is about 3,500 miles (5,600 km) thick. The Earth's magnetic field is important for protecting the planet from harmful particles from the Sun, such as protons. It also helps to maintain the ozone layer. The Earth's magnetic field is not constant, however, and it has been slowly weakening over the past 200 years. This weakening is thought to be caused by changes in the flow of the Earth's liquid outer core. It is possible that the Earth's magnetic field will eventually reverse, which would have significant implications for life on Earth."}
{"text":"\nTooth development is controlled by the ectoderm, one of the three primary germ layers that arise during gastrulation. Teeth are the only structures that develop outside the embryo proper, and are formed from the ectodermal germ layer. All vertebrate teeth develop in this way, although the details vary from group to group. The development of the dentition is divided into several stages, with the development of the permanent teeth occurring after the development of the primary teeth. Teeth develop in an inside-out order, with the enamel forming the outermost layer. Because teeth develop from the ectoderm, this layer is actually the innermost layer of the tooth. The middle layer is called the dentine, and the inner layer is called the dental pulp. The pulp is soft tissue that contains blood vessels and nerves.\n\nIn mammals, there are typically 20 primary teeth (also called deciduous, baby, or milk teeth) and 32 permanent teeth. The primary teeth erupt (break through the gum) when the animal is between six and nine months old. These teeth are gradually lost and replaced by the permanent teeth. This process begins around age six, when the incisors begin to erupt. The molars, which are the last teeth to erupt, emerge around age 12. The entire process of tooth development, from the first primary tooth to the final permanent tooth, can take anywhere from several months to several years.\n\nUnlike mammals, sharks have the ability to replace their teeth. They do this by growing a new tooth behind the old one. When the old tooth falls out, the new tooth moves forward to take its place. This process is repeated throughout the shark's life. This is possible because sharks have a single set of teeth, which are not used for grinding or chewing. These teeth are designed for grabbing and holding onto prey. Because of this, sharks do not need to replace their teeth very often."}
{"text":"\nThere is no one \"event\" that could take down the entire internet, but there are a number of different ways that the internet could be disrupted or taken offline. One possibility is a cyber attack that targets critical infrastructure, such as the Domain Name System (DNS). The DNS is a hierarchical system that translates domain names (e.g. www.example.com) into IP addresses (e.g. 192.168.1.1). If the DNS were to be disrupted, it would be difficult for users to access websites and online services. Another possibility is a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack, in which a large number of computers are used to flood a website or online service with traffic, making it difficult or impossible for legitimate users to access the site. DDoS attacks can be carried out by individuals or groups, and they can be directed at any website or online service. In either case, the result could be a temporary or permanent disruption of internet access. It is also worth mentioning that the internet is subject to the laws of physics, and it is possible that a natural disaster, such as a powerful earthquake or a large-scale solar flare, could disrupt internet access. However, these types of events are unlikely to bring down the entire internet. In summary, while it is not possible to pinpoint a single event that could take down the entire internet, there are a number of different ways that the internet could be disrupted or taken offline. It is important to be aware of these risks and to take steps to mitigate them."}

{"text":"\nThe number of degrees in a circle was one of the first mathematical concepts that we know about, since it's one of the basic building blocks of geometry. The ancient Greek mathematician Euclid wrote in his book the Elements that \"a circle is said to have been squared when it is brought to a plane figure in which the straight line equals the curved one.\" The word \"degree\" comes from the Latin word \"decimus,\" which means \"tenth.\" The number of degrees in a full circle was originally based on the number of days in a year.\n\nThe ancient Sumerians and Egyptians divided the year into 12 months, each with 30 days. Since there are 360 days in a year, the degree of a full circle is also 360. The number 360 is also related to the number of days in a year on other planets, such as Mars. For example, Mars has 668 Martian days in a year, which is approximately 668\/365 of a Martian year. On the other hand, Venus has about 224 Earth days in a year, which is approximately 224\/365 of a Venusian year."}

This can be caused by a number of factors, including the melting of ice caps and glaciers, the expansion of water as it warms, and the movement of tectonic plates. The sea level is currently rising at an average rate of 0.13 inches per year. This may not seem like much, but over time it can have a significant impact on the height of land above sea level. For example, if the sea level rises by one foot, the altitude of everything decreases by one foot. This can have a number of impacts on the environment and human activities. For example, it can lead to the erosion of beaches and the loss of coastal habitats. It can also make coastal areas more vulnerable to flooding and storm surges."}

{"text":"\n\nThe carbon-14 dating method was developed by Willard Libby in the 1940s. Libby and his team of scientists were able to show that carbon-14 dating could be used to determine the age of different objects, which could be helpful in archeology and other branches of science.\n\nThe method works because all living things on Earth are made up of carbon. Carbon-14 is a radioactive isotope of carbon that is formed in the atmosphere when nitrogen atoms are bombarded by cosmic rays.\n\nCosmic rays are high-energy particles that come from outside our solar system. They collide with atoms in the Earth's atmosphere, which causes nitrogen atoms to become carbon-14 atoms. The carbon-14 atoms then combine with oxygen to form carbon dioxide, which is taken in by plants. Since animals eat plants, they also take in carbon-14.\n\nAs long as a living thing is alive, it will continue to take in carbon-14. When it dies, however, it stops taking in carbon-14. The amount of carbon-14 in the dead thing will start to decrease as the isotope decays. By measuring the amount of carbon-14 in an object, scientists can determine how long it has been since the object died.\n\nThe half-life of carbon-14 is about 5,730 years. This means that it takes about 5,730 years for half of the carbon-14 in an object to decay. By measuring the amount of carbon-14 in an object, scientists can determine how long it has been since the object died.\n\nThe carbon-14 dating method has been used to date a variety of objects, including ancient artifacts and fossils. It has helped scientists to understand the history of our planet and the organisms that have lived on it. It has also been used to help determine the age of the Earth itself.\n\nOverall, the carbon-14 dating method is a valuable tool for scientists to understand the past and the present of our planet. It is a useful tool for archeologists and other scientists to understand the history of our planet and the organisms that have lived on it."}
{"text":"\nThe water is able to travel up the napkin against gravity because of the phenomenon known as capillary action. Capillary action is the ability of a liquid to flow against gravity in narrow spaces due to the forces of adhesion and cohesion between the liquid and the surrounding surfaces. In the case of a napkin being dipped in water, the water is able to travel up the fibers of the napkin due to these forces of adhesion and cohesion. The water is able to adhere to the surface of the napkin due to the polar nature of water, which allows it to form hydrogen bonds with the polar fibers of the napkin. The water is also able to cohere to itself due to the forces of surface tension. All of these forces work together to allow the water to travel up the napkin against gravity."}
{"text":"\n\nThere are two different types of fatigue, each with its own causes and treatments. The first is physical fatigue. Physical fatigue is the transient inability of a muscle to maintain optimal physical performance. It is the result of muscle glycogen depletion, and is usually reversed by a period of rest. Physical fatigue can be caused by a single session of intense exercise, or it can be caused by repeated sessions of exercise over a longer period of time. In either case, it is essential to allow the muscles to recover before exercising again. This will help to prevent further fatigue and will also help to ensure that the muscles are able to function at their full potential. The second type of fatigue is mental fatigue. Mental fatigue is the temporary inability to maintain optimal mental performance. It is often caused by prolonged periods of mental exertion, such as studying for an exam or working on a complex project. Mental fatigue can be treated by taking a break and allowing the mind to rest. This will help to restore mental alertness and will also help to prevent further mental fatigue.\n\nThe main difference between physical fatigue and mental fatigue is that physical fatigue is caused by muscle glycogen depletion, while mental fatigue is caused by prolonged periods of mental exertion. It is important to recognize the signs of fatigue and to take the appropriate steps to treat it, whether it is physical or mental fatigue. This will help to ensure that the body and mind are able to function at their full potential."}
{"text":"\nDeep sea fish are \"uglier\" and less symmetrical than their higher sea counterparts because they have evolved to survive in a harsh environment. The deep sea is a dark, cold, and high-pressure environment, which means that fish have to adapt to these conditions in order to survive. One way that they do this is by developing a more robust immune system. This means that they can afford to invest less energy in looking pretty and more energy in surviving and reproducing. Additionally, the darkness of the deep sea means that fish rely more on senses other than sight to navigate and find food. This may also contribute to their \"ugliness\" as they may not need to be as visually appealing to potential mates. Overall, the \"ugliness\" of deep sea fish is a result of their adaptations to the unique and challenging environment in which they live."}
{"text":"\nSome sea creatures breed in synchrony. This means that they all spawn their young at the same time and in the same place. This increases the chances that their young will find a mate and that the adults will be able to disperse their genes. This strategy works well when conditions are stable, but when the environment changes, it can leave the species vulnerable. For example, if the temperature in the water changes, and the plankton that the young sea creatures eat are no longer available, then the whole generation can die. Sea creatures that use this strategy include some coral, some sea worms, and some sea snails.\n\nAnother strategy is to breed continuously, as many land animals do. This allows the adults to disperse their genes over time, and allows their young to adapt to changing conditions. However, it means that adults and young are not in the same place at the same time, so the young have to be able to find their way to a place where they can meet other members of their species. This is a particular problem for animals that live in deep water, where the currents can be complex. Sea spiders, which live on the seafloor, have a very long larval stage. Some deep-sea octopuses also have long larval stages, and they also have complex ways of finding their way back to their parents."}

A rocket launching from Cape Canaveral, which is at 28.5\u00b0 N latitude, is only about 28.5\u00b0 N of the equator, so it is only moving at 28.5\u00b0 N * 1675 km\/hr = 468 km\/hr, less than 1\/10th the speed that a rocket at the equator would be moving. Thus, there's not a huge amount of angular momentum that the Earth's spin imparts to a rocket.

{"text":"\nWhen hot metal is placed in cold water, it does not shatter like glass because the atoms in the metal are more strongly bonded together than the atoms in glass. The bonds between the atoms in metal are stronger because the atoms in metal are held together by a crystalline structure. The atoms in glass are held together by a more random arrangement. When the metal is heated, the atoms move around more freely and the bonds between them become more flexible. This allows the metal to deform more easily without breaking. When the metal is placed in cold water, the atoms in the metal slow down and the bonds between them become more rigid. This makes the metal more resistant to deformation and less likely to shatter."}

{"text":"\n\nTo determine the energy content of food, scientists use a unit called the kilocalorie. One kilocalorie (kcal) equals 1,000 calories. In dietary terms, one kilocalorie is equal to one Calorie (with a capital C). The capital C distinguishes it from the smaller calorie, which is actually a kilocalorie.\n\nThe average daily energy intake is around 2,000 calories for women and 2,500 for men. Given that an average human needs around 2,500 calories a day to survive, how much energy is that in terms of TNT? To find out, we first need to determine the calories per second it would take to sustain a human. According to the second law of thermodynamics, living things produce just as much entropy as they consume. To sustain life, a human must consume about 100 watts of power, which is equivalent to roughly 240 calories per second. This means the daily energy intake of 2,500 calories is equivalent to 2,500,000 calories per day, or 7,500,000,000 calories per year.\n\nIf all this energy were converted into TNT, how big would the explosion be? Let's assume that all of this energy is stored as potential energy, and that it is converted to kinetic energy as soon as the material is ignited. The formula for potential energy is given as:\n\nPE = m * g * h\n\nwhere m is the mass in kilograms, g is the acceleration due to gravity (9.81 meters per second squared), and h is the height in meters. To find the height, we need to know the radius of the Earth, which is 6,378,100 meters.\n\nSo, all we have to do is multiply the number of calories by 9.81 meters per second squared, and we get the height in meters.\n\nFor 2,500,000,000 calories, we get an explosion height of 24,566,428 meters, which is roughly 80,000 kilometers. That's a pretty big explosion. In fact, it's big enough to reach the edge of space, which starts at 100 kilometers above Earth's surface."}

Does Mars have tectonic plates like Earth?\n\nWhile Mars is much less tectonically active than Earth, it still experiences some level of tectonic activity. Marsquakes are primarily caused by the release of strain as the planet's crust adjusts to the ongoing deformation of the mantle. The mantle is the mostly solid, rocky layer that lies between the crust and the core. The mantle is very rigid and does not flow like Earth's mantle.\n\nUnlike Earth's tectonic plates, which are broken up into separate pieces that move past, under, or over one another, Mars' crust is one continuous, solid sheet. There are no plate boundaries on Mars. The crust is broken up into rigid blocks that move as a unit over the mantle. These blocks are known as Martian tectonic plates. The movement of these plates causes the stress that leads to quakes."}

The answer may lie in the brain. Research suggests that the right posterior parietal cortex (rPPC) is critical for developing a sense of direction. People with damage to this part of the brain have great difficulty forming mental maps of their surroundings and tend to get lost easily. The rPPC is also involved in attention, so it's possible that people who are easily distracted or have poor attention skills may also have trouble developing a sense of direction.\n\nDo we know how the brain differs in such people? Yes, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been used to study the brains of people with good and poor sense of direction. Researchers have found that the rPPC is more active in people with good sense of direction, suggesting that this region may be more developed in people who are good at navigation. In addition, fMRI has revealed that people with good sense of direction also use other parts of the brain more effectively, including the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. These findings suggest that people who are good at navigation have a more developed and efficient brain network than those who are poor at navigation."}
{"text":"\nThe immune system has evolved to recognize and destroy foreign invaders such as bacteria, viruses, and parasites. However, it does not recognize sperm cells as a threat, and therefore does not attempt to destroy them. This is because sperm cells are not actually alive, and are only active for a short period of time. In addition, sperm cells are generally smaller than bacteria or viruses, and are able to evade the immune system's defenses. It is also important for sperm cells to be able to enter the female reproductive system and fertilize an egg, and the immune system's response would likely interfere with this process."}
{"text":"\nWhen you're on a train and it crashes, it's generally considered safer to be in a forward-facing seat. This is because in the event of a crash, the forward momentum of the train will cause the seats in the front to push into the seat backs of the seats in the rear. This will help to absorb some of the energy of the crash and may help to reduce the severity of injuries.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that even in a forward-facing seat, there is still a risk of injury in the event of a crash. So, it's always best to wear your seatbelt and to try to avoid being in the front seats of a train if possible."}

To better distribute the weight, the horse's back has evolved a pronounced curve, which helps to balance the load. The muscles on the animal's back are also much more developed than those of its forequarters. This muscle development helps the horse to pull against the rider's weight. Riding also made horses more alert and more responsive to aids. The bond between horse and rider is based on trust and respect.\n\nThe horse is a noble animal. For centuries, they have carried us on their backs, transported our goods, and fought on our behalf. In the process, horses and humans have changed each other. Today, horses are bred for their athletic prowess, but this was not always the case. Early horse breeds specialized in different tasks, whether it was pulling a plow or carrying a knight into battle. In the process, horses have changed the course of human history.\n\nEarly horses were small, but over time, they evolved to be larger. This was because people began to ride them, and bigger horses were better able to bear the weight of a person. The horse's back also became more curved, which helped to distribute the weight of the rider. The horse's muscles also became more developed, as they had to work harder to carry a rider. This also made the horse more alert and responsive to the rider's aids. The bond between horse and rider is based on trust and respect."}

{"text":"\nIn a word, yes. But it would be extremely difficult and there would be many ethical concerns.\n\nThe main way that scientists can affect the reward pathway in the brain is by using deep brain stimulation (DBS). This is a process in which a surgeon implants a small, battery-operated device called a neurostimulator under a person's skin. The neurostimulator is then used to send electrical impulses to specific areas of the brain.\n\nOne of the areas that can be targeted with DBS is the nucleus accumbens, which is a key part of the reward pathway. By stimulating this area, scientists can increase the release of dopamine, which can make a person feel more rewarded.\n\nHowever, DBS is not always effective and it can have side effects. It is also a very invasive procedure that requires a person to undergo surgery. Because of this, it is usually only used as a last resort for people who have tried other treatments and have not seen any improvement.\n\nIn addition, there are many ethical concerns surrounding the use of DBS. For example, it is not clear whether it is always safe to artificially increase the release of dopamine in the brain. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that plays a role in many different processes, including learning and motivation. It is also involved in the development of addiction, so it is possible that DBS could lead to unintended consequences.\n\nOverall, while it is possible to use DBS to affect the reward pathway in the brain, it is a complex and controversial process that should only be used under certain circumstances and with great caution."}

{"text":"\n\nTwins don't only share the womb - they share the same genes, and often the same environment. So why, then, do they sometimes look nothing alike? A new study suggests that the answer may be epigenetics. In other words, the differences may have to do with how and when the genes are turned on and off, rather than the genes themselves. This field of study is relatively new, but scientists think that epigenetics could one day play a role in how we treat diseases.\n\nIf identical twins have the exact same DNA, why do they often look slightly different than one another? This question has been asked by many people, and the answer is quite simple. The reason why identical twins sometimes look different is because of epigenetics. Epigenetics is the study of how and when genes are turned on and off. This can be influenced by a number of factors such as the environment, lifestyle, and even the way we treat diseases. In the case of identical twins, they may have different epigenetic patterns due to their different experiences in life. This can lead to differences in their physical appearance, even though they have the same DNA."}

Like light, sound, or any other wave, Wi-Fi signals disperse over distance and, as such, get weaker the farther they go. This is in contrast to something like a particle beam, which can be made to travel in a straight line without spreading out and losing intensity.\n\nBecause Wi-Fi signals weaken over distance, their effective range is limited. Depending on the power of the transmitter and the sensitivity of the receiver, as well as the physical and electromagnetic properties of the intervening space, the range of a Wi-Fi signal can be anywhere from a few meters to a few hundred meters.\n\nHowever, just because the effective range of a Wi-Fi signal is limited doesn't mean it can't travel farther. Wi-Fi waves, like all radio waves, travel at the speed of light. And while light does indeed have a maximum speed, it can travel infinitely far if it doesn't slow down to a stop.

For example, if the temperature is very low, it can cause the battery life of the devices to decrease rapidly.\n\nIn order to minimize the impact of these factors on the performance of your Wi-Fi network, it is important to place the router or access point in a location that is free from obstructions and away from sources of interference, such as microwaves or cordless phones. It is also a good idea to keep the router or access point at a moderate temperature, and to ensure that it is properly ventilated. You may also want to consider using a Wi-Fi extender or repeater to boost the signal in areas of your home or office that are experiencing poor coverage.

Their eyes have a nictitating membrane that protects the eye from debris and allows the cheetah to keep its eyes open wide while running at top speed. This wide field of view combined with their very sharp eyesight allows them to spot prey from far away and accurately judge the distance and direction of their prey while running at top speed. Their wide field of view also allows them to see potential predators from far away and to avoid them if necessary."}

All fundamental particles, like protons and neutrons, are made of even smaller particles. There are currently six different types of quarks known to science, and the Higgs boson is made of these quarks. However, the Higgs boson itself is unstable and decays into other particles. For this reason, it can't be observed directly, only inferred from its effects on other particles."}
{"text":"\nHurricane Matthew was an interesting storm, both for its intensity and for its path. A hurricane that made landfall in Haiti, Cuba, and the southeastern United States is not something you see every day. In fact, the last time a hurricane made landfall in all three of those places was Hurricane David in 1979. But what does this storm mean for the future? Was this the end of the 11-year super quiet period of major North American hurricane activity? Or are conditions still generally unfavorable for hurricane formation?\n\nThe answer is still up in the air. The hurricane season is far from over, and there is still plenty of time for more storms to form. However, the conditions that led to the formation of Hurricane Matthew are not likely to recur soon. The ocean temperatures in the Atlantic are now cooling off, and the wind shear is also decreasing. These two factors combined mean that it is now less likely for a hurricane to form.\n\nHowever, that doesn't mean that we're out of the woods yet. The hurricane season doesn't officially end until November 30th, and there is still plenty of time for a storm to form. So while the conditions that led to the formation of Hurricane Matthew are unlikely to recur soon, we still have a few more months of hurricane season to go."}

{"text":"\nThe human eye doesn't see images in pixels. The eye's retina contains photoreceptors called cones and rods, which send information about an image to the brain. The brain then processes that information to form a mental image of the object that the eyes are seeing. The number of pixels in an image depends on the resolution of the camera that took the picture, not the number of photoreceptors in the retina. For example, a camera with a resolution of 10 megapixels has 10 million pixels. The number of megapixels needed to take a good photograph depends on how the photograph will be used. For example, a 10-megapixel image might be sufficient for a 4-by-6-inch print, but a larger print or a professional-quality image would require more megapixels."}
{"text":"\n\nAnts are highly social creatures, and their behavior changes depending on their role in the colony. There are three main types of ants in a colony: workers, soldiers, and reproductive males and females. Workers are sterile and do all the work, such as foraging for food and caring for the young. Soldiers have large jaws and protect the colony from predators. The reproductive ants are the ones that leave the colony to mate.\n\nAnts communicate with each other using pheromones, which are chemical scents. These scents help the ants to identify each other and to know what tasks need to be done. For example, when a worker ant finds food, it leaves a trail of pheromones that tells other ants where to find the food. This is why ants always seem to be following each other in a line.\n\nThe workers and soldiers in a colony work together to protect and support the colony. They are not likely to fight each other, as they have different roles and responsibilities. The reproductive ants, on the other hand, may compete with each other for mates. This competition can sometimes lead to fights between the males.\n\nOverall, ants are highly organized and cooperative creatures. They work together to ensure the success of their colony, and they communicate with each other using pheromones. While the workers and soldiers are not likely to fight each other, the reproductive ants may compete for mates, leading to occasional fights."}
{"text":"\nThe police use radar guns to enforce speed limits. Those guns measure speed by bouncing radio waves off moving vehicles and measuring how fast the vehicle is moving relative to the radio waves. \nMost modern cars have a speedometer that uses the rotation of the wheels to calculate speed. In older cars, the speedometer was connected to the transmission (the mechanism that changes the gears in an automatic transmission) and measured engine revolutions per minute (rpm) and then translated that into a speed. \nThe problem with a car's speedometer is that the wheels can slip, especially on wet or icy roads. That means the wheels are spinning, but the car isn't moving. This leads to a speedometer that is telling you one speed, but the car is actually moving at a different speed. A modern GPS doesn't have that problem. A GPS measures the actual distance traveled over a period of time and uses that to calculate the speed. This means that a GPS is much more accurate at measuring speed. However, a GPS isn't connected to the car in any way. It relies on signals from the Global Positioning System (GPS) which is a network of about 30 satellites in orbit around the Earth. These satellites send radio waves that allow a GPS to work out the location of the car. A GPS is also more accurate than a radar gun because the radio waves can be affected by rain or snow. So, in summary, a GPS is much more accurate than a car's speedometer, but a car's speedometer can be accurate if the wheels are maintaining traction with the road. Neither the GPS nor the speedometer are connected to the car, so neither of them can tell if the wheels are slipping."}

When cognition is impaired, it can be difficult to focus, make decisions or respond appropriately to the environment.\n\nThere are many reasons why cognition may be impaired. One reason is that the brain is not getting enough oxygen. This can happen if you are very tired, have been drinking alcohol, or have been exposed to high levels of carbon monoxide. Another reason is that the brain is not getting enough glucose. This can happen if you have not eaten for a long time or if you have diabetes. \n\nCognition can also be impaired by certain medications, such as sleeping pills, tranquilizers, or painkillers. These medications can make it difficult to think clearly or remember things.\n\nFinally, cognition can be impaired by mental health conditions, such as depression or anxiety. These conditions can make it difficult to concentrate or make decisions."}

This is called \"transversality\" or \"time delay\" or \"propagation delay\". However, when the wire is not long compared to the wavelength, then the phase of the signal will change as the signal propagates. This is called \"dispersion\" or \"frequency-dependent delay\"."}
{"text":"\n\nSuppose you have a right triangle with hypotenuse of length 1 and one of the catheti has length \u221a1. Square both sides of this triangle, and you get a new right triangle with hypotenuse of length 1 and one of the catheti has length \u221a1. Since the hypotenuse and one cathetus are the same lengths in both triangles, the triangles are similar. Thus, the hypotenuse of the second triangle is \u221a2, since it's the square root of the hypotenuse of the original triangle.\n\nKeep on squaring, and you get \u221a3, \u221a4, \u221a5, etc. This means that there is a whole other set of complex numbers out there, called the \"imaginary numbers,\" which are the square roots of negative numbers. They're called imaginary, because they're a mathematical fiction, a convenient place to put numbers whose square is negative. If you try to find an \u221a(-1) in the real world, you'll just find that there's no such thing as the square root of a negative number.\n\nThe imaginary numbers play an important role in mathematics and physics, where they're used to solve problems that arise in electricity and magnetism. But they're also useful in pure mathematics, where they provide a rich and beautiful set of numbers that behave in fascinating and unexpected ways."}
{"text":"\nArchimedes was able to calculate the volume of a sphere by using the method of exhaustion. This method involves approximating the shape of a sphere with a series of regular polygons, such as triangles or squares. The area of each polygon can then be calculated, and the sum of these areas will give an approximation of the surface area of the sphere. The volume of the sphere can then be calculated by subtracting the volume of a cone or cylinder with the same base area and height from the approximated surface area.\n\nThis method was first used by Archimedes in his work The Measurement of a Circle. In this work, Archimedes used a series of regular polygons to approximate the circumference of a circle. He then calculated the area of each polygon and found that the sum of these areas was equal to the area of the circle. This showed that the circumference of a circle could be approximated with a series of regular polygons, and it also gave an approximation of the value of \u03c0."}

{"text":"\nDecoherence is a process by which a quantum system (like the one created in a lab) loses its quantum properties (like superposition) as it interacts with its environment. It is as if the system and its environment are so strongly interacting with each other that the properties of the system are washed out.\n\nFor example, imagine a quantum system and its environment as two balls connected by a spring. If the balls are pushed together, they will bounce off each other and move away from each other. If they are pulled apart, they will bounce back towards each other. The spring represents the interaction between the quantum system and its environment. If the system and its environment are not interacting strongly, then the balls will remain in the same place. This represents a state of quantum coherence. If the balls are pushed together, they will bounce off each other and move away from each other. This represents a state of quantum decoherence.\n\nIn quantum mechanics, the process of decoherence is very complex and is still not fully understood. It is thought to be related to the process of wave function collapse, in which the probability of finding a system in a particular state decreases over time. Decoherence is a major challenge for the development of quantum technologies, as it can cause quantum systems to lose their quantum properties, making them less useful for applications such as quantum computing."}

{"text":"\nThe idea of using balloons to help a rocket reach space is not new. In fact, it was first proposed in the late 1950s and has been studied extensively since then. The basic concept is to use a balloon to carry a rocket to an altitude where there is less drag and more lift, thereby reducing the amount of fuel required to reach orbit.\n\nThere are a number of advantages to this approach. First, it could potentially reduce the amount of fuel required to reach orbit, which would make rockets cheaper to launch. Second, it would also reduce the amount of pollution produced by rockets, as they would not have to burn as much fuel. Finally, it could make rockets safer to launch, as they would not have to lift all of the fuel and oxidizer off the ground.\n\nHowever, there are also some disadvantages to this approach. First, it would be more difficult to control the rocket once it was released from the balloon. Second, it would be more difficult to land the rocket once it had reached orbit. Finally, it would be more difficult to launch the rocket in the first place, as it would have to be carried to a high altitude by the balloon."}

At that speed, it's impossible to see what's going on at the other side of the universe. It's only when we observe the universe that we see a three-dimensional space. The observable universe has a spherical shape. However, there's no edge to it.\n\nIf the universe is infinite, then there's no center either. And since the universe is expanding, there's no boundary. That means that there's no edge to the observable universe. The farthest we can see is the same distance as the farthest we can see in any other direction. Even though we can't see the other side of the universe, we can still be affected by things that happen there. For example, gravity from other galaxies can still affect us. The universe is thought to be infinite, so there's no limit to how far away something can be. So even though we can't see beyond the observable universe, we can still be affected by things that happen there."}

The conditions necessary for a nuclear reaction to occur are very specific. The most important of these conditions is that the atom must have a high enough energy state to be able to split. This means that the atom must be hit by a fast-moving particle, such as a meteor, with enough energy to cause the atom to split. If the meteor contains the right stuff, meaning it is made up of atoms with a high enough energy state, and if it hits land containing the right stuff, meaning the land is made up of atoms with a high enough energy state, then it is possible for a nuclear explosion to occur."}

{"text":"\n\nA rocket engine's thrust is typically reported in pounds-force or newtons, a unit of force. In this case, the Saturn V's thrust was 7.6 million pounds-force, or about 33.5 million newtons. To convert this to horsepower, we need to know the efficiency of the engine. A car engine, for example, is about 20% efficient, which means only 20% of the energy stored in gasoline is turned into kinetic energy. The Saturn V's engine was probably not much more efficient than this. So, 33.5 million newtons is the equivalent of about 6.7 million horsepower. To put this in perspective, a modern car engine produces about 200 horsepower, and a big diesel locomotive might have 5000 horsepower. The Saturn V's engine was more than 100 times more powerful than a big locomotive. It's also worth mentioning that a million watts is approximately 1.34 horsepower. The Saturn V's engine produced about 2.2 million watts, or about 3.5 times more power than a million watts."}

{"text":"\n\nIn botany, the term \"lignotuber\" refers to a woody swelling formed from a plant's primary root. The majority of perennial plants, including many fruit trees, form such a structure. When the above-ground portion of the plant dies back in the winter or during a dry season, the root system is protected from desiccation (extreme dryness) by the lignotuber.\n\nThe air spaces inside some fruits, such as peppers, are not composed of any particular substance. These spaces are known as \"void chambers.\" They exist between the flesh of the fruit and the seeds, and they serve to reduce the weight of the fruit. This, in turn, allows the seeds to be dispersed more easily by wind or animals. In peppers, the chambers are also used to store capsaicin, the chemical compound that gives peppers their heat. The capsaicin is released when the peppers are cut or bitten, which is why they are spicy. The chambers also provide a way for the seeds to be dispersed without being damaged by the heat."}
{"text":"\nAncient languages tend to be more complex than modern languages. This is because they often have a more complex grammar and a larger vocabulary. For example, classical Greek is considered to be more complex than modern Greek.\n\nOne reason for this is that ancient languages were often used for more formal and literary purposes. They were also often used in contexts where precision and accuracy were important, such as in law, philosophy, and science. This meant that they needed a more complex language to express these concepts.\n\nAnother reason is that ancient languages were often not as widely spoken as modern languages. This meant that they were not as influenced by everyday speech and were less likely to evolve in a simplifying direction.\n\nOverall, ancient languages tend to be more complex than modern languages. However, there are exceptions to this rule, and some modern languages, such as English, are just as complex as some ancient languages."}

However, the Moon's revolution cycle is 27 days, completing approximately 13 orbits around Earth. This cycle is longer than the 24-hour rotation of Earth's atmosphere. Thus, the Moon's revolution cycle is longer than the atmospheric cycle. Therefore, it is unlikely that the Earth's atmosphere and the Moon's atmosphere coincide to form a bulge."}
{"text":"\nThe fatigue life of an airplane wing flexing during turbulence is determined by monitoring the number of times it has gone through a full cycle. The wings on most commercial airliners go through over a billion cycles in their lifetime. Airlines keep track of this number and after a certain point require an inspection of the wing. For instance the A check requires the removal of the panels and the B check requires the removal of the panels and the rivets. The C check is essentially a rebuild of the wing. This involves replacing all the parts, including the skin.\nThe process of keeping track of the number of cycles is known as \"limit counting\". There are a number of different ways of doing this. One is to use \"cycles\" as a unit, and count the number of cycles the structure has gone through. Another way is to use \"loads\" as a unit, and count the number of times the structure has been subjected to a certain level of load. This is known as \"damage accumulation\". The advantage of using \"loads\" as a unit is that it is possible to predict the number of cycles a structure will go through before it fails, given the loads it has been subjected to. This is known as \"fracture mechanics\" or \"damage tolerance\".\nThe number of cycles or the amount of damage a structure has been subjected to can be measured in a number of ways. One way is to use strain gauges to measure the amount of strain the structure is under. Another way is to use visual inspections to look for cracks or other damage. A third way is to use non-destructive testing such as X-ray or ultrasound to look for damage."}

{"text":"\n\nIf energy cannot be created or destroyed, how come the universe is expanding at an accelerating rate? Where does the energy for this expansion come from?\n\nAccording to the general theory of relativity, the total amount of energy in the universe is constant. This is referred to as the conservation of energy. The universe is not expanding into \"new\" energy that is being created out of nothing. The expansion of the universe is not an explosion, but rather a stretching.\n\nAlbert Einstein proposed that the universe was static. However, astronomer Edwin Hubble discovered that distant galaxies were moving away from Earth, and the universe was expanding. The universe can be thought of as a loaf of raisin bread rising in the oven. The raisins represent galaxies, and the dough represents space. As the bread rises, the raisins move away from each other. The space between the raisins is expanding.\n\nIn the case of the universe, everything is moving away from everything else. The universe is one large, expanding space. Nothing is moving through space. Space itself is expanding.\n\nIt is possible to have a universe that is expanding yet still have the total energy of the universe constant. The expansion of the universe can be thought of as space itself moving. Just as the raisins move away from each other as the bread rises, the galaxies move away from each other as the universe expands. The total amount of raisins (or galaxies) remains constant. The total amount of dough (or space) is expanding.\n\nSo, if the universe is expanding, where is all of this energy coming from? The answer is that the energy is not coming from anywhere. It has always been there. The energy in the universe was created at the beginning of the universe.\n\nConsider the raisin bread example again. If the raisins represent galaxies and the dough represents space, then the raisins and dough had to exist before the bread was baked. The dough was not created as the bread baked. Similarly, the energy of the universe was created at the beginning of the universe. The universe has not created any new energy as it has expanded. The energy of the universe is constant."}

Acid rain can also cause damage to human-made structures, such as buildings and monuments.\n\nAcid snow, on the other hand, is not caused by pollution. It is simply snow that has a high concentration of acid. This acid is usually the result of natural processes, such as the oxidation of sulfur compounds in the air.

Water is clear because when light hits the surface only blue and green light is reflected. The water appears blue because the only light that is reflected is blue light. The water appears green because the only light that is reflected is green light. Water is not clear because white light is made up of all colors and so when light hits the water all colors are reflected and the water appears white.\n\nSnow appears white for the same reason that water appears blue or green. The reason why snow appears white lies in the unique structure of the water molecule. Water molecules are polar, which means they have one end that is positively charged and one end that is negatively charged. The unique thing about the water molecule is that the positive end of one water molecule is attracted to the negative end of another water molecule. This causes water molecules to aggregate or \"clump\" together. In liquid water, these clumps are small and the water appears to be clear. In solid water (ice), these clumps cause the light to be reflected equally and so the snow appears white."}
{"text":"\n\nSmell is a kind of chemical sense. Many small molecules that are generally found in low concentrations in the air are odorants. These molecules bind to a protein called an olfactory receptor protein, which is located in the membranes of nerve cells in the nose. When an odorant binds to a receptor protein, it initiates a series of events that ultimately leads to the transmission of a nerve impulse.\n\nThe olfactory system contains millions of sensory neurons that are capable of detecting thousands of different odorants. Each sensory neuron has a single odorant receptor. This organization is called the \"lock-and-key\" theory, because each receptor has a keyhole shape that is specifically shaped to fit a particular odorant.\n\nThere are other types of smell, such as that of water on a hot day or the smell of O2 (the odor of the air after a thunderstorm). We also use the term smell to describe other sensations, such as the smell of fear or the smell of danger. These types of smell are really sensations that are not exactly olfactory in nature."}
{"text":"\n\nThe body's response to blood vessel blockage is called thrombosis. When thrombosis occurs, the body creates a clot to prevent blood from flowing through the blood vessel. A clot is a clump of blood platelets and fibrin. A blood vessel can clot for a variety of reasons. Sometimes a clot will dissolve on its own. Other times medication is needed to dissolve the clot. When a clot blocks a blood vessel in an arm or leg, the result is often the loss of that limb. In the case of a lost limb, the body still needs to send blood to the area where the blood vessel used to be. To do this, the body creates a collateral blood vessel. A collateral blood vessel is a new blood vessel that the body creates to bypass the blocked blood vessel."}
{"text":"\n\nDespite sharing a habitat with millions of people infected with HIV, mosquitoes somehow have never been implicated in spreading the virus. New research shows that a set of mosquito proteins might be the key to this mystery. By locking onto and blocking a human protein that HIV needs to infect cells, these mosquito proteins may be able to stop HIV from getting a foothold in the body. The research team was led by Anthony Lee, an infectious disease doctor and virologist at the University of Iowa. He says that HIV has been found in almost every human organ and tissue that has been examined, \"and yet we don't see efficient transmission of HIV from person to person through mosquitoes. This raised the question of why mosquitoes don't spread HIV.\"\n\nLee and his colleagues turned their attention to Aedes aegypti, the mosquito species that can spread dengue, yellow fever, and Zika. These mosquitoes have a protein on their surface that binds to a human protein called ApoE. The human protein acts like a ferry, picking up and carrying cholesterol around the body. But in people with a certain version of the gene that codes for ApoE (ApoE4), the ferry service goes haywire. Instead of carrying cholesterol, the human protein ends up carrying a toxic protein that causes Alzheimer's disease. Lee and his colleagues found that Aedes aegypti mosquitoes have proteins that also bind to ApoE. And when the researchers looked at human genes that code for ApoE, they found that the part of the gene that codes for the part of the human protein that binds to the mosquito protein is the same part that codes for the part of the human protein that binds to the Alzheimer's protein.\n\nLee says that this raises the possibility that the human protein evolved to lock onto and block the mosquito protein. \"We speculate that these human genes that allow binding to the mosquito proteins may have been under strong selection,\" Lee says. \"And that selection may have been to stop binding of the mosquito protein, which would be protective against dengue, yellow fever, and Zika, which are all mosquito-borne diseases.\""}

{"text":"\nBerries evolved to be eaten, but not all of them are safe to eat. Some have developed toxins to make themselves less appealing to creatures that might eat them. The same is true of other plant parts, such as seeds, leaves, and flowers. \n\nFor example, the fruit of the durian tree (Durio spp.) is edible, but the tree also produces deadly poison. The durian fruit's spiky exterior and strong odor discourage most animals from eating it, but some species of monkeys are known to eat the fruit. Humans have cultivated the durian tree for its fruit for hundreds of years, but they must exercise caution when collecting the fruit. Ingesting the durian's seeds can be deadly.\n\nOther berries, such as the pokeberry (Phytolacca americana), are not poisonous, but their berries are not very tasty. Pokeweed is a native North American plant that has been introduced to other parts of the world, where it is considered a noxious weed. It produces large clusters of small, dark purple berries that birds and other animals typically avoid. In the wild, the pokeberry's toxins serve to keep the plant from being over-eaten, which would reduce its ability to reproduce.\n\nSome plants, such as the nightshade (Solanaceae) family, which includes the tomato, eggplant, and belladonna, produce both edible and poisonous members. For example, the fruit of the tomato plant (Solanum lycopersicum) is edible, but the leaves and stems of the plant are poisonous. The same is true of the eggplant (Solanum melongena), but the fruit of the belladonna plant (Atropa belladonna) is extremely toxic. \n\nThe reason why some berries are poisonous is that they evolved to be so. This is a defense mechanism that protects the plant from being eaten by animals. The berries of some plants, such as the durian, are not only poisonous but also have a very strong odor, which further discourages animals from eating them. Other berries, such as the pokeberry, are not poisonous but are not very tasty, which also serves to protect the plant from being over-eaten. Finally, some plants, such as the nightshade family, produce both edible and poisonous members."}
{"text":"\nThe universe is constantly expanding because we can see that all the galaxies are moving away from each other. We can also measure the rate of expansion by using the Hubble Constant. The Hubble Constant is the rate at which the universe is expanding. This value has been measured to be about 70 km\/s\/Mpc. This means that for every megaparsec (a unit of distance) that the universe expands, it does so at a rate of 70 km\/s. The value for the Hubble Constant has been measured by several different methods, including using the Hubble Space Telescope and the Wilkinson Anisotropy Probe. This measurement is important because it tells us about the rate at which the universe is expanding. It also tells us about the age of the universe. The universe is about 13.8 billion years old, which means that it has been expanding for about 13.8 billion years. This is important because it tells us about the history of the universe and how it has evolved over time."}
{"text":"\n\nBoth cows and horses are herbivores, and thus rely on cellulose for their energy needs. Cellulose is a carbohydrate that is found in the cell walls of plants, and is therefore abundant in plant matter, such as grasses and other forage. Both cows and horses have evolved to effectively digest and utilize cellulose, but they do so in different ways.\n\nCows have evolved to have a specialized stomach called the rumen, which is specifically designed to break down cellulose. The rumen is a large, chambered organ that is essentially a large fermentation vat. In the rumen, bacteria and other microorganisms break down the cellulose into smaller molecules that can be more easily digested and absorbed by the cow. The cow then recycles these smaller molecules back through the rumen, where they are further broken down. This process continues for hours, allowing the cow to extract as much energy as possible from the cellulose.\n\nHorses, on the other hand, do not have a specialized stomach for digesting cellulose. Instead, they rely on a combination of their own digestive enzymes and the action of bacteria in their hindgut to break down cellulose. The horse's hindgut is much longer than the cow's, allowing for more time for the cellulose to be broken down.\n\nOverall, both cows and horses are able to effectively digest and utilize cellulose, but they do so in different ways. The cow relies on a specialized stomach, the rumen, to break down cellulose, while the horse relies on a combination of its own enzymes and the action of bacteria in its hindgut. This difference in digestive strategy allows cows and horses to efficiently extract energy from cellulose, allowing them to thrive as herbivores."}

{"text":"\n\nInflammation is the complex biological response of vascular tissues to harmful stimuli, such as pathogens, damaged cells, or irritants. It is characterized by five cardinal signs: redness, heat, pain, swelling, and loss of function. Inflammation involves the four well-known symptoms listed above, as well as a complex series of biological processes. Inflammation is a protective attempt by the organism to remove the injurious stimuli and to initiate the healing process for the tissue. However, in some cases inflammation may be initiated inappropriately, or continue longer than necessary, resulting in damage to healthy tissue. In such cases, inflammation can become counterproductive, leading to, for example, autoimmune diseases, chronic inflammatory diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, and cancer. Many of these diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease, are debilitating and affect a large proportion of the population. In these cases, drugs that can suppress the unwanted immune response are often the only effective treatment. These drugs, such as corticosteroids, can have severe side effects. Thus, there is a need for new drug targets that can be used to suppress the unwanted immune response and provide treatment for the many diseases caused by inappropriate inflammation.\n\nIn general, the immune system responds to harmful stimuli by activating the innate immune system, which is followed by an adaptive immune response. Innate immunity involves a non-specific, broad-spectrum inflammatory reaction that is generally short-lived. The purpose of this inflammatory reaction is to eliminate the stimuli and also to summon the adaptive immune response, which is specifically targeted to the stimulus. Thus, the innate immune response is generally protective, while the adaptive immune response is the primary cause of harmful inflammation. The innate immune system is activated by chemical factors released by injured or infected cells (such as histamine, bradykinin, and prostaglandins), as well as by physical factors such as bacterial endotoxins, and by pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-1 (IL-1). The purpose of this inflammatory response is to eliminate the stimuli and also to summon the adaptive immune response, which is specifically targeted to the stimulus. Thus, the innate immune response is generally protective, while the adaptive immune response is the primary cause of harmful inflammation. The inflammatory response can be divided into two phases: initiation and propagation. The initiation phase is characterized by the recognition of the stimuli and the activation of the immune system. The propagation phase is characterized by the amplification and maintenance of the inflammatory response. The amplification phase is regulated by the immune system, but it is also influenced by other factors, such as the environment, genetic factors, and stochastic (random) processes."}

{"text":"\nSolar energy has always been more expensive than fossil fuel energy. The main reason for this is that the sun doesn't shine 24 hours a day, and solar cells are currently only about 20% efficient. That means that it takes a lot more solar panels to generate the same amount of electricity as a coal-fired power plant. Another reason is that solar panels are not very durable. They only last about 20 years, so they have to be replaced about twice during the life of a coal-fired power plant.\n\nThere have been many developments in solar technology that have reduced the cost of solar energy. The most important of these is the development of thin-film solar cells. These cells are made from a very thin layer of material, which makes them much cheaper to manufacture than traditional silicon solar cells. Another important development is the use of concentrating solar power. This technology uses mirrors to focus the sun's energy on a small area, which makes the solar cells much more efficient.

For one, cells must move to the right place at the right time. Mistakes can be costly: If a cell ends up in the wrong place, a creature might end up with two left hands, or two right feet, or a heart on the outside of its body. For this reason, scientists long thought that the way animals are built is highly conserved across species.\n\nNot so, according to new research. By studying the development of sea urchins and sand dollars, an international team of scientists led by Shai Izraeli of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel, and the University of Geneva in Switzerland, discovered that despite having very similar exteriors, the two species have completely different systems of internal organs. Their findings were published in Science.\n\nThe researchers compared the gene expression patterns of the two species as they developed. \"We found that the process leading to the formation of the endoderm [an inner layer of cells] is much more variable than we thought,\" says Izraeli. In fact, the endoderm of the sea urchin is organized completely differently from that of the sand dollar. And the differences don't stop there. The researchers also found that the mesoderm\u2014a middle layer of cells that develops into the gut, the heart, and other organs\u2014is similarly variable across species. In other words, the way an animal's body is built seems to be much more flexible than previously thought.\n\nThis finding has implications for our understanding of evolution.

On the other hand, geologists do have evidence of much larger eruptions that occurred before the three most recent ones, so it's not like the current pattern of a super eruption every half-million years must be maintained into infinity. The fact that the Yellowstone super volcano has been relatively quiet for so long may be more ominous than if it had been acting up. That's because the magma underneath the caldera is continually being renewed as the North American tectonic plate moves slowly over the Yellowstone hotspot, and the new magma may be more explosive than what we've seen in the past. In the worst case, it could generate a super eruption so enormous that it would blanket the United States in volcanic ash and possibly plunge the Earth into a \"volcanic winter\" that could last for years. There are signs that the magma chamber beneath Yellowstone is filling up again, and it could be gearing up for another super eruption. But we don't know when that will happen, or if it will happen at all. \n\nIt's also worth noting that the super volcano would not erupt in a Hollywood-style cataclysmic explosion that would make the landscape uninhabitable.

They can include economic measures such as freezing a country's assets or limiting trade, or military steps such as closing a country's ports or refusing to recognize its government.\n\nIn 2014, the US and the European Union imposed sanctions on Russia after it annexed Crimea and began supporting separatists in eastern Ukraine. The measures have limited Russia's access to foreign capital markets and restricted its exports of energy resources.\n\nIn recent weeks, the US and EU have increased sanctions on Russia over its military buildup near Ukraine and the imprisonment of opposition leader Alexei Navalny. The US also imposed sanctions on Russia in April for alleged election interference and cyberattacks.\n\nThe new measures include targeting Russian banks and limiting Russian access to EU and US capital markets.

The reason is the following: in order to freeze a bottle of water, you need to extract heat from it. The only way to do this is to transfer heat from the surroundings to the bottle. And as you can imagine, this will be easier if the bottle has a large surface\/volume ratio, as in the case of the 1 liter bottle, than if it has a small surface\/volume ratio, as in the case of the 0.5 liter bottle."}
{"text":"\nIn particle physics, string field theory is a theoretical framework that describes physical phenomena at energies higher than the string theory energy scale. The term \"string field theory\" refers to a special type of field theory in which the fields are taken to be string excitations. In contrast to other types of field theories, string field theories are not invariant under local gauge transformations. Instead, the gauge symmetry is a global rather than a local one. This non-invariance under local gauge transformations is closely related to the non-renormalizability of string field theories."}
{"text":"\n\nTurtles and whales actually do get dementia. In humans, dementia is a broad term for a group of symptoms associated with a decline in memory or thinking skills severe enough to reduce a person's ability to perform everyday activities. Alzheimer's disease accounts for 60 to 80 percent of cases of dementia.\n\nAlthough it is not as common, dementia can also occur in animals. A condition known as cognitive dysfunction has been diagnosed in dogs, cats, and other mammals. This condition is similar to dementia in humans and is associated with a decline in cognitive function. Cognitive dysfunction is most common in older animals, just as dementia is more common in older people.\n\nTurtles and whales have much longer lifespans than humans, so it is difficult to know for certain whether these animals experience cognitive decline as they age. However, there are reports of whales and turtles that have exhibited signs of dementia or other cognitive impairment.\n\nFor example, there are accounts of whales that have become stranded on beaches or become lost in shallow waters, suggesting that they may have lost their sense of direction. Similarly, there are reports of turtles that have become disoriented and stranded on land. These behaviors could be due to dementia or other cognitive impairment.\n\nIt is important to note that these reports are anecdotal and do not provide definitive evidence of dementia or cognitive impairment in whales or turtles. More research is needed to understand the cognitive function of these animals and how it changes with age."}
{"text":"\nAs the ISS grew over time, its center of mass must have changed location. How did their thrusters change their behavior or were they literally moved to a new location? The ISS does not have a single thruster, but it does have several different systems on the Russian and US parts of the station that are used to maintain the ISS's orbit and attitude. The Zvezda and Zarya modules on the Russian segment of the ISS each have four main engines and eight smaller engines, the Odissey lab has two main engines and four smaller engines, and the Unity module has six main engines and 12 smaller engines. Altogether, the ISS has 32 engines that it can use to maintain its orbit. These engines are periodically used to boost the ISS's altitude and to change its inclination. In addition, the US segment of the ISS has several smaller thrusters that are used to maintain its attitude, which is the orientation of the ISS's axes in relation to the Earth. The thrusters on the US segment are not used to change the station's orbit, as the Russian segment's engines are more powerful and can perform this task more efficiently. Overall, the ISS's engines are used to maintain the station's orbit and attitude, and are not physically moved to different locations on the station as it grows. Instead, the ISS's growing size is accounted for in the station's flight dynamics, as the engines are controlled to maintain the station's altitude and inclination within specified parameters."}
{"text":"\nWe can't yet do what Dear askscience wants us to do, namely \"heat water to generate steam to spin a magnet inside a copper coil\" to generate electricity. However, we can do the equivalent, generate electricity from nuclear fusion, and this is what we do in nuclear power stations. The fusion reaction that we use to generate electricity is the same one that powers the sun, and is called nuclear fusion because we fuse two light nuclei to form a heavy nucleus, with the liberation of energy. There is another, much rarer, nuclear reaction, called nuclear fission, that is also used in nuclear power stations. In fission, a heavy nucleus is split into two lighter nuclei, with the liberation of energy. The energy liberated in both fusion and fission is used to heat water to spin a magnet inside a copper coil to generate electricity. In fact, the magnets used in nuclear power stations are very large superconducting magnets, and are cooled by liquid helium to make them superconducting. Superconducting magnets are much stronger than ordinary magnets, so they can produce much larger magnetic fields. The large currents needed to charge the magnets are produced by nuclear fission. So nuclear power stations do indeed use fusion to generate electricity. However, there are problems with nuclear fission. The fuel used in fission is a rare isotope of uranium called uranium-235. Only 0.7% of all natural uranium is uranium-235. The rest is mostly uranium-238, which cannot be used in fission. So the first step in the nuclear fuel cycle is to enrich the uranium. This is a costly and energy-intensive process. Also, the fission products are radioactive and produce nuclear waste. This waste is difficult and costly to dispose of. And finally, there is the small matter of nuclear weapons. Plutonium-239, which is one of the fission products, is used in nuclear weapons. So the use of nuclear fission in nuclear power stations has led to the proliferation of nuclear weapons. This is why research into nuclear fusion is so important. Nuclear fusion does not have these problems. The fuel for fusion is deuterium and tritium, both of which are easily available. The fusion products are helium, which is non-radioactive, and a small amount of neutrons. So the nuclear waste problem does not exist. And deuterium and tritium cannot be used in nuclear weapons. So, nuclear fusion is a much better way to generate electricity."}

Betelgeuse would be as bright as the full moon, and would be visible in broad daylight. It would be the most luminous supernova since the 17th century, and possibly since the birth of our galaxy. If you saw it, you'd be very unlikely to need to wait 600 years for the light to reach you.\n\nBut if you wanted to do high-precision cosmology, you might want to wait 600 years for the light to reach you, because the expansion of the universe would carry that light far away from us, and by measuring how far away the supernova is, we can learn how fast the universe was expanding at that time. We hope to do much better than that; we'd like to know how fast the universe was expanding at times when it was only a few billionths of a percent of its current age. To do that, we need to wait until the light from the supernova gets to us, and that means waiting longer than the age of the universe."}

{"text":"\nGravity is a very weak force. To picture this, compare the gravitational force between you and a chair across the room to all the other forces between you and the chair: the electric forces between the molecules in your skin and the molecules in the chair, the force of your bones against the chair, the force of the air in the room against the chair, and so on. The gravitational force is far weaker than any of these other forces, and it is also very weak compared to the force of the nuclear glue that holds protons and neutrons together in the atoms of your skin and the atoms of the chair. It is ridiculous to think that the chair \"warps\" the space around it. Space is completely empty, and objects move through it without changing it in the least. To say that gravity \"bends\" space is not a physical statement. It is a way of describing what happens in a coordinate system that is not a part of the physical universe. It is true that General Relativity describes a geometric structure for the universe, called a Lorentzian manifold, and this structure has some interesting properties. One of these properties is that the mathematical structure of the universe is \"curved\", in the sense that the shortest path between two points is not a straight line. But this curvature is an artifact of the coordinate system, not a feature of the physical universe. The claim that the universe is \"curved\" in this sense is a statement about coordinate systems, not about physics. In General Relativity, there is no physical meaning to the statement that space is curved. It is simply a way of saying that General Relativity makes a certain kind of mathematical prediction. It is true that the universe might actually be curved in a more substantial sense, for example because it is wrapped around a black hole. But this has nothing to do with General Relativity, and everything to do with the fact that General Relativity makes very different predictions in a universe with a black hole than it does in a universe without one. General Relativity does not predict that space is curved, and it does not predict that the universe is curved. It is just a theory that happens to make certain mathematical predictions in a universe that has a certain geometrical structure. If the universe had a different geometrical structure, General Relativity would make different predictions. To sum up: it is true that General Relativity makes certain mathematical predictions, and these predictions are accurate, at least within the domain of our experience. But the claim that the universe is \"curved\" in the sense that General Relativity makes mathematical predictions is not a physical statement. It is a mathematical statement, and it is only meaningful in a coordinate system that is not a part of the physical universe."}
{"text":"\nWe can use the following reaction to describe this process:\n\nphoton + electron \u2192 heat\n\nIn this reaction, a photon collides with an electron and transfers some of its energy to the electron. This energy is converted into heat, which can cause the electron to move around more rapidly. This increased motion results in a higher temperature, which is a form of energy.\n\nIn this reaction, both the photon and the electron are conserved. The total energy of the system, which is the sum of the energy of the photon and the energy of the electron, remains constant. The law of conservation of energy states that the total energy of a system cannot change.\n\nThus, as long as there are photons and electrons in the universe, the metal will never run out of either one. The number of photons and electrons may change over time, but the total amount of energy in the universe will remain constant."}

This makes it cheaper to operate the satellite and also means that it can be used for a longer period of time.\n\nThe geostationary orbit is fixed at a distance of about 36,000 km from the Earth because this is the optimum distance for a satellite to be in a geostationary orbit.

Another reason for dark circles under the eyes is that the muscles around the eyes can weaken over time, causing the skin to sag. This can also make the area under the eyes darker. Genetics can also play a role in dark circles under the eyes. If your parents had them, you're more likely to get them too. Aging can also cause dark circles under the eyes. As we age, our skin loses collagen, which can make the area under our eyes darker. Allergies can also cause the skin under the eyes to darken.

The stronger the gravity, the faster the things inside a black hole will move. The faster things move, the hotter they get. Since black holes are so dense, they can be very hot. Some black holes are billions of degrees hot. That means they are hotter than any place in the Universe. But how do we know how hot black holes are? We can't put a thermometer in a black hole to find out. So how do scientists figure it out?\n\nOne way to figure out the temperature of a black hole is to look at the light it makes. A black hole can pull light into it. But light can't go any faster than light speed. So light that gets too close to a black hole will get pulled in. As it gets closer and closer to the black hole, it will start to look redder and redder. The hottest black holes will make light that looks redder than anything else. This is because the light is being pulled at almost the speed of light. So it gets very red before it gets pulled into the black hole.\n\nAnother way to figure out the temperature of a black hole is to look at the things around it. The stuff around a black hole will get very hot as well. The closer things are to the black hole, the hotter they get. If a cloud of gas gets too close to a black hole, it will start to get very hot. It will get so hot that it will start to shine. When this happens, the gas cloud is called a plasma. Plasmas are the fourth state of matter, which means they are even hotter than black holes."}

These diseases would be the greater threat to survival than the lack of food. The obese person would also have a more difficult time physically, since carrying extra weight increases the energy expenditure for mobility. There are also psychological factors to consider. Being stranded on a barren island is a very stressful situation, and stress can trigger overeating. This would make it more likely that the obese person would eventually perish from eating all of the available food, while the thin person would die from lack of food. There are also environmental factors that would affect the survival of both people, such as exposure to sun and extreme temperatures, protection from wild animals, and ability to signal for rescue."}

{"text":"\nA zebra is a zebra, and not just a differently colored horse, because of the different number of chromosomes. Horses have 64 chromosomes and zebras have between 32 and 46. The number of chromosomes differs between zebra species, but all zebras have fewer chromosomes than horses. In addition, zebras and horses can't mate with each other. They have different numbers of chromosomes and are considered different species.\n\nIn addition, zebras have never been domesticated. Unlike horses, which have been domesticated for centuries, zebras are wild animals that have never been tamed. Their unpredictable nature makes them difficult to ride and handle. Also, zebras have never been used for work like horses have, so they have retained much of their wild nature."}

But for people with cat allergies, these furry creatures can be a source of misery.\n\nSo, if you're allergic to domestic cats, does that mean you're also allergic to wild cats? The answer is a bit complicated. All cats are in the same family, but they're not all the same. There are actually 40 different species of wild cats, and they're not all related to domestic cats. Some wild cats, like lions and tigers, are actually more closely related to other big cats, like jaguars and leopards.\n\nSo, if you're allergic to domestic cats, it's possible that you're also allergic to wild cats. But it's not a guarantee. If you're allergic to domestic cats, the best thing to do is to avoid them. And if you're planning on visiting a zoo or a wildlife park, it's a good idea to check with the staff to see if any of the animals there are related to domestic cats."}

It wasn't until the early 20th century that scientists realized that the bones belonged to creatures that no longer existed -- dinosaurs.\n\nDinosaur fossils have been found on every continent on Earth. In many cases, the skeletons are incomplete. Sometimes, scientists have had to use their imagination to reconstruct the dinosaurs' complete skeletons. For example, they had to guess the shape of a velociraptor's skull. Over the years, many different reconstructions of the velociraptor's skull have been made.\n\nThe most famous dinosaur skeleton is probably that of a Tyrannosaurus rex. This fearsome carnivore lived during the late Cretaceous period, about 66 million years ago. The first T. rex fossil was discovered in the Hell Creek Formation in the U.S. state of Montana in 1902. Since then, many other T. rex skeletons have been found. The most complete one is nicknamed \"Sue\" and is kept in the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, Illinois.\n\nScientists have also discovered well-preserved dinosaur nests, complete with eggs. These nests have helped paleontologists figure out how dinosaurs cared for their young. For example, they've learned that Maiasaura, a type of herbivorous dinosaur, formed herds. Adults in the herd took turns watching over the nest while the other members went out looking for food."}

The liver can regrow to its original size in a matter of weeks. This is why living donors are able to donate a portion of their liver to a recipient. The liver will regenerate in both the donor and the recipient. \n\nLiving donors are not in need of a new liver in the future. Recipients, however, will eventually need a new liver. Unfortunately, the liver is one organ that cannot be transplanted twice due to the regeneration process.

{"text":"\n\nThe Doppler effect is a change in the apparent wavelength of light or sound waves. This happens when the source of those waves is moving toward or away from an observer. If a wave source moves toward an observer, then that observer perceives shorter waves than the source actually emitted. If a wave source moves away from an observer, then that observer perceives longer waves than those actually emitted. The Doppler effect is a real phenomenon, but it's not something that space agencies have to worry about with their spacecraft. Spacecraft are so far away from Earth that the Doppler effect is negligible.\n\nNew Horizons, for example, is on its way to Pluto. At its closest approach, New Horizons will be about 7,800 miles (12,500 kilometers) from Pluto's surface. The spacecraft is moving at about 32,200 mph (51,900 km\/h), fast enough to reach Pluto in about nine and a half years. Earth, meanwhile, is about 2.9 billion miles (4.6 billion kilometers) away. Because of that distance, the effect of New Horizons' approach on the frequency of its radio transmissions will be infinitesimally small."}
{"text":"\nIn geology, porosity is a measure of the amount of empty space (pore volume) in a rock. The overall porosity of a rock is the percentage of the total volume of the rock that is empty space. The volume of a rock that is empty space is the total volume less the volume of solids and liquids in the rock. A porous rock is one that has a large porosity. A non-porous rock is one that has a small porosity.\n\nPorosity is an important concept in geology because it describes the capacity of a rock to store fluids. The porosity of a rock is a factor in determining how much oil, gas, or water can be extracted from the rock. For example, a rock with a high porosity will have a large pore volume and will be able to store a large amount of fluid. A rock with a low porosity will have a small pore volume and will be able to store a small amount of fluid."}

{"text":"\nZero resistance is possible because the current is carried not by electrons, but by the quasiparticles called holes. When a semiconductor is cooled to very low temperatures, it is possible for electrons to be separated from the atoms that they normally orbit. In this case, the electrons are not tightly bound to the nucleus and are free to move about the crystal. However, as the temperature is increased, these electrons will eventually fall back into their original orbits. As the electrons fall back into their original orbits, they leave behind a hole. This hole is not an empty space, but rather the absence of an electron. It behaves like an electron with a positive charge, and it can move through the crystal in much the same way. The hole current is just like the electron current, except that it is positively charged.\n\nBecause the hole current has the same properties as the electron current, it can also be affected by a voltage. If a voltage is applied to the semiconductor, the holes will begin to move in the direction of the electric field. As the holes move through the crystal, they will encounter resistance from the nuclei and lattice of the semiconductor. However, if the applied voltage is large enough, the holes will be able to overcome this resistance and move through the crystal unimpeded. This is what is meant by zero resistance. It does not mean that there is no resistance whatsoever, but rather that the resistance is so small that it can be considered to be zero."}

{"text":"\n\nIn the early 1930s, Hideki Yukawa predicted that the nuclear force responsible for holding protons and neutrons together in the nucleus was also responsible for holding quarks together in protons and neutrons. This would mean that the nuclear force was much stronger than the electrical force that repels protons from each other in the nucleus. According to classical physics, a force this strong should create a huge amount of energy whenever it pulled two quarks together. But in the 1940s, when particle accelerators became powerful enough to create the energies necessary to probe the nuclear force directly, this energy was nowhere to be found. The strong force turned out to be much weaker than Yukawa had anticipated.\n\nBut the mystery of the nuclear force's weakness turned out to be only the first of several surprises that particle physics had in store for us. Theorists soon realized that the nuclear force's weakness meant that the energy required to create a proton was less than the energy that could be released by creating a proton. This meant that it should be possible to turn energy into matter, and matter into energy\u2014the very process that powers stars.\n\nThis is one of the most important ideas in modern physics: the notion that the fundamental forces of nature are not just the messengers that transmit the universe's matter and energy from place to place, but are also the agents that convert one into the other. Particle accelerators re-create this process on a tiny scale. The energy stored in an electric field pulls apart the nuclei of atoms, creating matter; that matter is then accelerated to very high speeds, creating energy."}

{"text":"\n\nThe short answer is that yes, a punch at a certain speed would be the same, but the effect of gravity would increase the force.\n\nIf we assume that the strength of the muscles in an ant's body are the same as those of a human (which is not true, of course), then the speed of a punch (or any other type of movement) would be the same for both a human and an ant. According to the equation for kinetic energy, the kinetic energy of a punch would be the same, regardless of the size of the person delivering the punch or the person receiving it.\n\nHowever, because of the increased effect of gravity, the punch would be subject to a greater force (due to gravity). For example, if a person weighing 200 lbs (91 kg) punched another person, the force would be 200 lbs \u00d7 9.81 m\/s2 = 1876 N. But if the person weighed only 10 lbs (4.5 kg), the force would be 10 lbs \u00d7 9.81 m\/s2 = 98 N. So the second person would be hit with almost 100 N more force!

{"text":"\n\nWhile there are a few theories, the leading hypothesis is that venom evolved as a way to quickly subdue prey. \n\nFor a predator to capture a meal, it must overcome the physical defenses of its prey (i.e. protective armor, spines, or hard shells). Prey species have evolved these protective measures because a predator capturing one individual would remove that one individual from the gene pool, which would be less favorable from the prey's evolutionary perspective. \nVenom, on the other hand, is more likely to kill the predator outright. This means that the venomous prey has a better chance of surviving and passing on its genes.\n\nBecause it takes a lot of energy to produce the venom, and because the venom is also used to kill other predators, venomous species tend to be smaller than their non-venomous counterparts.

The transgender spectrum also includes non-binary identities that do not fit into the male\/female binary.\n\nThere is no one-size-fits-all answer to what separates transgenderism from a mental disease. Mental illness is a complex and multifaceted concept that can vary greatly from person to person. For some people, transgenderism may be a mental illness, and for others, it may not be.\n\nThe important thing to remember is that transgender people are not mentally ill. They are simply people who identify with a different gender than the one they were assigned at birth. They deserve to be treated with respect and compassion, just like anyone else."}
{"text":"\nIn recent years, scientists have become increasingly interested in the ways quantum mechanics might play a role in how our brains work. One possible area of interest is the phenomenon of quantum entanglement, which occurs when two or more particles are linked in such a way that the state of one particle cannot be fully described without considering the state of the others. It is thought that quantum entanglement may play a role in the way our brains process information, and it has been suggested that it could be used to create a \"quantum brain\" that would be more efficient than the traditional kind. However, it is still unclear whether quantum mechanical effects have any physiological consequences for how our brains work. It is possible that they do not, and that the role of quantum mechanics in the brain is purely theoretical. Alternatively, it is possible that quantum mechanics plays a more subtle role, affecting the way that neurons communicate with each other or the way that information is processed in the brain. Ultimately, more research is needed to understand the potential role of quantum mechanics in the brain, and to determine whether it could be used to improve the way our brains function."}

If your cells were getting enough oxygen, then you would not feel the urge to breath. However, it is important to note that if you were to resist the urge to breath for too long, you could potentially suffer from oxygen deprivation and suffocate. This is why it is important to listen to your body and breath when you need to."}

As a result, rainbows are only visible on Earth, since they require water droplets and sunlight. Other planets in our solar system, such as Mars and Jupiter, also have water, but they lack an atmosphere that scatters light in the same way as Earth's atmosphere. Therefore, rainbows are not visible on other planets in our solar system."}
{"text":"\n\nThe Burj Khalifa, which is currently the tallest building in the world, stands at 2,722 feet tall. The Jeddah Tower, which is currently under construction, is expected to be the first building to exceed the Burj Khalifa's height once completed. While the Burj Khalifa is impressive, there are many other skyscrapers under construction that will be even taller. There is no set height limit to how tall a building can be. The Burj Khalifa could be surpassed by a building that is double or even triple its height. Skyscrapers have grown taller over the years as building technology has improved. Today, engineers are capable of building much taller buildings than they were a century ago. Skyscrapers are also becoming more common, especially in urban areas where land is scarce and expensive. There is a demand for housing and office space, which is often more efficiently utilized in tall buildings. As cities continue to grow and population density increases, the demand for skyscrapers is likely to remain high. Skyscrapers are also popular tourist attractions, and many cities compete with each other to have the tallest building. This competition is likely to drive the construction of even taller skyscrapers in the future. In conclusion, there is no height limit to how tall a skyscraper can be. As technology continues to advance, skyscrapers will continue to grow taller and taller."}

{"text":"\nThe question of how matter can take up space has been puzzled by philosophers and scientists for centuries. One explanation is that matter is made up of subatomic particles, which are themselves invisible and take up no space. However, these particles can interact with each other in such a way that they create the illusion of space. This explanation is known as the wave-particle duality.\n\nAccording to quantum mechanics, all matter has both a wave and a particle nature. The wave nature of matter is associated with its energy, while the particle nature is associated with its matter. The wave-particle duality is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics, and it explains how matter can take up space while being made up of subatomic particles that take up no space.\n\nFor example, when two particles interact with each other, they can create a wave-like pattern of energy. This wave-like pattern of energy can then interact with other particles, creating the illusion of space. This explanation is consistent with the observation that matter can take up space and that subatomic particles are themselves invisible and take up no space."}
{"text":"\nI'm going to give you a partial answer because I'm not sure of the answer. I think the basaltic magma is much less viscous than the more silicic magmas, so it will tend to spread out more as it moves across the surface. That's why the flows from the big shield volcanoes are so wide. As the magma cools, it tends to form long, somewhat rounded, almost sinewy shapes. These flows often move very rapidly, and can carry blocks of solid rock which they pluck from the walls of their channels. When the surface of a flow begins to cool, the movement of the magma is usually not far beneath. The edges of the flow, where they are exposed to the air, begin to solidify. The more viscous interior, however, can continue to move. This sometimes causes a flow to move beneath a solidified surface, which can cause the surface to crack. I don't know if this is what you mean by \"layering\" but I think that is a good way to think of it. I hope this helps."}

In 1859, Darwin received a letter from Alfred Russel Wallace, who had independently reached the same conclusions as Darwin. The theory of evolution was not accepted right away. Many people believed that it conflicted with the teachings of the Bible, and therefore, it could not be true. However, over time, more and more evidence has been found to support the theory of evolution.\n\nMany scientists have rejected creationism because it is not supported by scientific evidence. One example is the finding of a skeleton of a dinosaur, which provides evidence that dinosaurs lived many millions of years ago. Another piece of evidence is the presence of a protein called a homeobox in the bodies of all animals. This protein is like a \"master control switch\" that turns other genes on and off, and it is shared by all animals. This indicates that all animals have a common ancestor."}
{"text":"\nIn order for a nuclear bomb to be effective, the explosion needs to happen at a height above the ground. This is because when the bomb is detonated, it creates a blast wave that expands in all directions. If the bomb is detonated on the ground, the blast wave will be limited to a small area. By detonating the bomb at a height, the blast wave can expand over a larger area, causing more damage. Additionally, detonating the bomb at a height allows for more of the energy from the explosion to be directed downward, causing more damage to the target. Finally, detonating the bomb at a height also reduces the risk of the bomb being damaged by the ground before it is detonated."}
{"text":"\n\nBefore the advent of the Internet, mobile phones and other modern means of communication, messages used to be transported from one place to another by means of homing pigeons. These birds have an uncanny ability to find their way home over extremely long distances. This has long been a source of fascination for humans. But how do pigeons know where to go?\n\nThe answer lies in the pigeon's ability to use the Earth's magnetic fields as a form of GPS. This is a trick they share with a number of other animals, including honey bees, sea turtles, tuna, salmon, lobsters, migratory birds, seals, whales, bats and even humans. Pigeons have iron-rich cells in their beaks, which act as tiny compass needles. They are able to sense the Earth's magnetic fields and navigate accordingly. They also have an inbuilt \"map sense,\" meaning they can use landmarks, the position of the sun, and even the skylines of cities to find their way around.\n\nHowever, scientists believe pigeons' reliance on magnetic fields is the overriding factor in their ability to home. One theory is that pigeons are born with a \"map\" of the magnetic fields imprinted on their brains, which they then use as a navigational aid. When a pigeon is released from its home location, it flies in the direction of its home, guided by the Earth's magnetic fields. If the bird is taken far enough away from its home, the magnetic fields will change, and the bird will be able to recalibrate itself and find its way back home. This ability to recalibrate itself is the key to how pigeons know where to go.\n\nPigeons are able to sense the Earth's magnetic fields because their beaks contain iron-rich cells. These cells act like microscopic compass needles, allowing the birds to orient themselves in the direction of the Earth's magnetic fields. This is how pigeons know where to go."}
{"text":"\nCuring cancer has been a long sought-after achievement in the medical field. However, the term \"cure\" can be misleading. In many cases, \"cured\" implies that the cancer will never come back. That is often not the case. Many cancers can be controlled and managed, but cancer cells can still remain in the body. With the use of treatments like chemotherapy and radiation, many patients are able to live for many years. While there are some individual cancers that have been \"cured\" with these treatments, such as testicular cancer, these cures are not across the board. For most other cancers, the goal is remission.\n\nFor example, a person diagnosed with breast cancer may go through chemotherapy and radiation, and may be considered \"cured,\" but there is still a chance that cancer cells could remain in the body. If that person were to stop all treatment, the cancer could return. For that reason, many people who have been diagnosed with cancer and go into remission continue to receive some sort of regular check-ups and screenings to ensure that the cancer does not return."}

But what if mirrors can defeat the US military's powerful laser weapon?\n\nThe idea is simple: reflect the laser beam back at the source. While it may seem like a simple solution, it's actually not that easy to do. The reason is that lasers are designed to be focused in a single direction, so reflecting the beam back at the source would require a precise and highly polished surface. It would also require a surface that is large enough to reflect the entire beam.\n\nSo, while it's possible to defeat the US military's powerful laser weapon with mirrors, it's not as easy as it sounds. It would require a lot of effort and resources to create a large and highly polished surface, and it's not something that can be done quickly or easily."}
{"text":"\nThe concrete block will not re-solidify into a block if you add water to the powder. This is because concrete, unlike cements, does not undergo a chemical reaction when it comes into contact with water. The only reaction that would take place is a physical one, as concrete is basically a mixture of cement and aggregate. When water is added to concrete, it only hardens (or cures) due to the hydration reaction between the cement and water. This results in the concrete setting and hardening, but not re-solidifying into a block."}
{"text":"\nThe human eye has three types of color receptors (cones), which are sensitive to different wavelengths of light. When light of different wavelengths stimulates the retina, the brain compares the different signals from each type of cone. From these comparisons, the brain constructs the perception of color. Since the color receptors in the eye are not all equally sensitive, the color we perceive depends on the intensity of light and the number of color receptors stimulated. For example, when you look at a ripe tomato, the color you perceive is not the same color that someone else perceives. Because the number of color receptors that are stimulated depends on the intensity of light, color vision is subjective. That is, color is not an inherent property of objects, but rather it is created by the eye and brain. So, if you were denied exposure to a color for a year, your perception of it would change once you saw it again."}

{"text":"\n\nHow can we tell whether a galaxy it tinted red due to redshift, or just naturally having a red glow?\n\nThe light coming from the galaxy has a certain spectrum. If the galaxy is moving away from us, the light gets stretched to longer (redder) wavelengths. We call this process redshift. But light can also be redder if the galaxy is intrinsically very massive and hot, and the light is shifted to longer wavelengths due to the Doppler effect.\n\nFor distant galaxies, we can measure the redshift, and we can also measure the spectrum of the galaxy, and thus we can tell whether the red color is due to the redshift or due to the temperature of the galaxy. This is one of the main methods used by astronomers to measure distances to very distant galaxies."}
{"text":"\nWater is essential for life, and most organisms have lived in the ocean at some point in their existence. There is evidence that life emerged from the water onto land, but is there any evidence of evolution happening from land back to water?\n\nThere is some evidence that certain species have evolved to live partially or entirely underwater. For example, the mudskipper is a fish that has adapted to living on land and can breathe air. The mudskipper uses its fins to move on land and can even climb trees. Another example is the water spider, which lives on the surface of water and can dive beneath the surface to catch prey. These examples show that evolution can happen from land to water, but it is not common.\n\nOverall, most species evolved to live on land and have not evolved to live in the water. This is likely because water is a more challenging environment for life to thrive. Water is colder and less oxygenated than air, and it can contain predators and pollutants. For these reasons, most species that evolved to live in the water did so because they were forced to, and their bodies adapted to these new conditions."}
{"text":"\nMethane is a much more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. It has a much higher global warming potential, meaning that it has a greater ability to trap heat in the atmosphere. This makes methane a major concern as the world warms and permafrost begins to melt. \n\nThe amount of methane that could be released due to permafrost melting is difficult to predict. It will depend on the rate and extent of permafrost melting, as well as the conditions under which the methane is released. If the methane is released quickly, it could have a significant impact on climate change. If it is released slowly, the impact may be lessened. \n\nIn general, the melting of permafrost due to global warming is likely to have negative effects. The release of methane and other greenhouse gases will contribute to further warming, leading to more melting of permafrost and the release of even more greenhouse gases. This could create a feedback loop that accelerates global warming. In addition, the melting of permafrost could also have other negative impacts, such as the release of toxins and pollutants that have been trapped in the ice for centuries. \n\nOverall, the potential impacts of the melting of permafrost due to global warming are difficult to predict, but they could be significant and negative. It is important to take steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to mitigate the effects of global warming in order to reduce the risk of these impacts."}

First, it allows for the creation of customized joints that are specifically designed to fit the individual's anatomy. Second, it allows for the creation of joints that are stronger and more durable than traditional joints. Third, it allows for the creation of joints that are more biocompatible, meaning that they are less likely to cause irritation or inflammation.\n\nHowever, there are also some challenges to 3D printing joints. First, it is difficult to print complex joint geometries, such as the ball-and-socket joint of the hip. Second, it is difficult to print joints that are both strong and flexible, as is required for the knee. Third, it is difficult to print joints that are biocompatible, as the materials used in 3D printing may not be well-suited for use in the body.\n\nOverall, 3D printing has great potential for the creation of customized joints that are stronger, more durable, and more biocompatible.

{"text":"\nThe main reason CPUs have been limited in frequency to around 3.5GHz for so many years is because of the inefficiency of the transistors at higher frequencies. At higher frequencies, the transistors start to behave less like an ideal switch and more like a resistor. This is because the charge carriers (electrons) start to encounter more resistance when moving through the transistor. This causes the charge carriers to collide with the atoms in the semiconductor, which in turn generates heat. The amount of heat generated is related to the frequency of the charge carriers, which is why CPUs generate more heat at higher clock frequencies. This limits the amount of boost you can give to a CPU before the heat becomes too much to handle and starts to affect the performance of the CPU. Additionally, at higher frequencies, the transistors also start to encounter problems with their own capacitance, which can further limit their performance."}

A hybrid is rarely fertile when the two species differ in ploidy. For example, mules are infertile, because a horse has 64 chromosomes and a donkey has 62. When a sperm with 64 chromosomes and an egg with 62 chromosomes fuse, the chromosome number is not a multiple of the original numbers, and so the resulting zygote is not viable.\n\nLigers, like other hybrid species, result from the mating of a male lion and a tigress. Because lions and tigers are of different species, their chromosomes are not compatible. The liger is, therefore, sterile.

Here's why you might want to brush your tongue.\n\nTaste buds are collections of cells that help you taste your food. They're not visible, but they're located all over your mouth, including on your tongue. These cells are replaced every 1 to 2 weeks, according to the American Dental Association (ADA).\n\nThe top layer of cells on your tongue is what you see when you look in the mirror. It's a protective layer that keeps bacteria from getting into your mouth. It's also what you're cleaning when you brush your tongue. But the cells underneath aren't affected.\n\nYou should brush the top of your tongue when you brush your teeth. This helps remove bacteria that can cause bad breath. It can also improve your overall oral health, according to the ADA."}

{"text":"\n\nWhen we think of concussions, we think of football. But the National Football League is just one of many sports in which concussions are common. In fact, concussions can happen in any sport or situation in which the head moves rapidly and suddenly stops, causing the brain to move and stretch inside the skull. This sudden movement can cause bruising and other damage to the brain.\n\nOne group that experiences concussions quite frequently is rugby players. This comes as no surprise, considering that rugby players use their bodies to tackle one another, often head-to-head. But what may surprise you is that, according to a 2013 study, female rugby players suffer from concussions more often than male rugby players. In fact, the 2013 study showed that female rugby players had a 59% higher risk of concussion than male rugby players. Why is this?\n\nIt comes down to the size and shape of the male and female skulls. Simply put, a male skull is bigger, wider, and thicker than a female skull. The reason for this is evolutionary: the male skull is designed to better protect the brain from the impacts that can occur during physical activity. The female skull, on the other hand, is more slender and more delicate.\n\nSo, what can we learn from rams? Well, their skulls might be able to teach us a thing or two about concussion prevention. According to a 2016 study, ram skulls have a unique \"elastic shield\" that works to absorb and disperse the energy from impacts to the head. The study found that this elastic shield reduced the force of impacts by up to 20% compared to other animals, such as sheep.\n\nThe researchers behind the study believe that this elastic shield could provide inspiration for concussion-prevention technology, such as helmets and other protective gear. By mimicking the way that the elastic shield works, we could potentially reduce the risk of concussions in athletes and other individuals who are at risk of suffering from a concussion.\n\nSo, the next time you see a ram running head-first into a wall, think about the elastic shield that's protecting its brain. And the next time you see an athlete wearing a helmet, think about the potential of technology to reduce the risk of concussions."}
{"text":"\nThe idea of a \"placebo effect\" is well-known, in which people who are given an inert \"placebo\" medication experience an improvement in their condition simply because they believe they are receiving treatment. It is not controversial to say that a person's beliefs and expectations can influence their experience of pain or other sensations. But can beliefs and expectations also influence the experience of pleasure?\n\nA new study suggests that they can. Researchers found that people who were given an opioid drug (oxycodone) without their knowledge still experienced pleasure from the drug, but their craving for the drug was less intense than people who were told they were receiving the drug. This finding suggests that the experience of pleasure from opioids may be influenced by expectations and beliefs, and that these factors may play a role in the development of opioid addiction.\n\nThis study is consistent with the idea that opioid addiction is not simply a physical dependence on the drug, but also involves the person's expectations and beliefs about the drug. If a person believes that they are receiving an opioid drug, their craving for the drug may be less intense than if they believe they are receiving a placebo. This finding suggests that interventions that target expectations and beliefs about opioid drugs may be effective in reducing the risk of opioid addiction. It also suggests that the experience of pleasure from opioids may be influenced by psychological factors, in addition to physical factors."}

{"text":"\nThe patent that your grandfather held was for the nuclear fission reactor. This is a device that can be used to generate electricity by using the energy released from the fission (splitting) of atoms of uranium or plutonium. Fission is the process of splitting an atom into two or more smaller atoms. This requires a large amount of energy to be input into the system, but the energy released when the atoms fission can be used to generate electricity. The fission of atoms of uranium or plutonium produces a large amount of heat, which can be used to generate steam and drive a turbine to produce electricity. The first nuclear fission reactor was developed by Enrico Fermi in the 1930s. The development of the nuclear fission reactor was a major achievement in the field of physics and engineering, and it has had a significant impact on the world. It is a clean and efficient source of energy, and it does not produce greenhouse gases or other pollutants. However, the use of nuclear fission reactors is controversial because of the risk of nuclear accidents and the problem of nuclear waste. Despite these concerns, the nuclear fission reactor remains a key technology for the production of electricity."}
{"text":"\n\nThe idea that muscles \"tear\" during exercise is actually a bit of a misnomer. What actually happens is that muscle cells are damaged, and the body responds by creating new muscle protein cells to replace them.\n\nThe process of muscle protein synthesis (MPS) is responsible for this. MPS is the process of the body using protein to repair and rebuild muscle cells. This process is essential for muscle growth and recovery after exercise.\n\nThere are several things that can affect MPS, such as the type of exercise you do, your diet, and your overall health. For example, research suggests that certain types of exercise, such as resistance training, may be more effective at triggering MPS than others. Similarly, a diet that is high in protein can also help to boost MPS.\n\nOverall, MPS is an essential process for muscle growth and recovery. By understanding how it works, you can take steps to maximize your muscle protein synthesis and see better results from your workouts."}

{"text":"\n\nThere is a huge reservoir of methane under the Arctic Ocean, and if even a small fraction of it were released quickly, it would have catastrophic effects. A new study looks at how quickly that might happen. The Arctic is warming twice as fast as the rest of the globe, and sea ice is rapidly declining. This is not only leading to a host of other changes in the Arctic system but is also creating a feedback loop, where decreasing sea ice cover allows more solar radiation to be absorbed by the darker ocean, thus warming the ocean and further decreasing the sea ice cover. One of the potential consequences of a warmer Arctic is the release of methane from the seafloor of the Arctic Ocean. Methane is a very potent greenhouse gas, and the amount of methane stored in the Arctic is huge. A recent study estimates that up to 17,000 teragrams (Tg) of methane (around 600 billion cubic meters) may be stored in the form of methane hydrates and free gas in shallow sedimentary reservoirs in the Arctic. By comparison, the total amount of methane in the atmosphere at any given time is around 500 million tons. While a large fraction of this methane would likely be released slowly over time, e.g. due to the reduction of sea ice and ocean warming, there is a risk that at least some of it would be released abruptly, e.g. due to an earthquake or a landslide. Such an event would have serious consequences for the global climate. While abrupt releases of methane from the Arctic have not been documented so far, there is geological evidence that such events have happened in the past. A new study in Geophysical Research Letters looks at the likelihood and consequences of a rapid release of methane from the Arctic. The authors use a combination of climate models and available paleoclimate data to estimate the impact of a rapid methane release on the climate. The results suggest that the release of up to 50 Tg of methane over a period of a few years would have only a modest effect on the global climate, as it would mainly warm the Arctic. However, the study also finds that the methane release rate would need to be sustained over several centuries in order for the additional methane to have a serious impact on the global climate. This means that while a rapid methane release in the Arctic would not have an immediate effect on the global climate, it could still have long-term consequences."}

{"text":"\nCarbon dating is a technique used to determine the approximate age of organic materials, such as wood and fossils. The technique is based on the fact that all living things contain carbon, and that the amount of carbon in a material decreases over time as it decays. The technique works by measuring the amount of carbon in a material and comparing it to the amount of carbon in a known sample, such as a piece of wood that has been dated using other techniques.\n\nThe reason we trust carbon dating is because it is based on the fact that all living things contain carbon, and that the amount of carbon in a material decreases over time as it decays. This means that the older a material is, the less carbon it will contain. This is a fairly straightforward and reliable method for determining the age of organic materials, and it has been used successfully for many years. It is important to note that carbon dating is not foolproof, and it is possible for the results to be inaccurate if the material being dated is contaminated or if the sample being compared to is not a good match. However, when properly conducted, carbon dating is a reliable and useful tool for determining the age of organic materials."}

The answer lies in the fact that salt can have different effects on snow depending on the temperature. At low temperatures, salt will increase the viscosity of water and harden the snow. At high temperatures, salt will reduce the freezing point of water and melt the snow.\n\nIn the case of the Olympics in Sochi, the organizers are trying to use salt to harden the snow and reduce the risk of it melting. This is because the temperatures in Sochi are quite low, so the salt will help to harden the snow and reduce the risk of it melting.

The microbes in the gut are able to adapt to different dietary patterns and nutrient availability, and they can proliferate or decline depending on the specific nutrients that are available. For example, some microbes may grow and divide more rapidly when they are exposed to a particular type of food, while others may become more active in the presence of certain nutrients.\n\nIt is also important to note that the gut microbiome is not necessarily made up of discrete populations of bacteria that are specific to certain types of food.

This can cause the internet to slow down for everyone. Another cause of the randomness is the fact that the internet is a complex system. There are a lot of factors that can affect the speed of the internet. For example, if there is a problem with one of the servers that is providing the internet, this can cause the internet to slow down. If there is a lot of traffic on the internet, this can also cause the internet to slow down.\n\nOverall, the randomness of internet speeds is caused by a combination of factors.

It is made up of the same amino acids, lipids, and other compounds that make up real meat. However, it is chemically identical to the meat we eat today.\n\nIn terms of nutrition, lab-grown meat is nutritionally similar to conventional meat. It contains the same amount of protein, vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients. The main difference between lab-grown meat and conventional meat is that lab-grown meat is grown in a sterile environment, while conventional meat is grown in a natural environment. This means that lab-grown meat is free of bacteria, viruses, and other microorganisms that can cause foodborne illness.\n\nIn terms of taste, lab-grown meat is very similar to conventional meat. It has the same texture, flavor, and appearance as conventional meat. However, some people say that lab-grown meat is a bit blander than conventional meat. This is because it is grown in a sterile environment and is not exposed to the same bacteria and other microorganisms that can give conventional meat its distinctive flavors.\n\nOverall, lab-grown meat is chemically identical to conventional meat.

This is because they are able to propagate due to the electric and magnetic components of the wave. These fields are able to interact with the charged particles in the media and allow the wave to propogate. Other waves such as sound waves require a medium to propogate because they are mechanical waves. This is because the energy from the wave is transferred via the motion of the particles in the medium. Without a medium the energy from the wave would not be able to be transferred. This would mean that the wave would not be able to propogate."}

{"text":"\nThe most common form of hair loss in men is known as male pattern baldness. It usually starts with a receding hairline and thinning at the crown of the head. Going bald on the sides is not as common. There are several possible explanations for this. Firstly, male pattern baldness is usually caused by a combination of genetics and hormones. The hormone DHT (dihydrotestosterone) is thought to be a major cause of male pattern baldness. DHT is a byproduct of testosterone and it binds to the hair follicles and damages them. This leads to the hairs becoming thinner and eventually falling out. The hairs on the sides of the head are not usually affected as much as the ones on the top because they are further away from the main source of DHT production, which is the adrenal glands. The sides of the head are also protected by the presence of the ears, which may also serve to shield the hairs from DHT. Another possible explanation is that the hairs on the sides of the head are simply more resistant to DHT. This could be due to differences in the hair follicles themselves or in the way that they respond to DHT. It is also possible that other factors, such as stress or diet, may play a role in hair loss. In any case, it is clear that going bald on the sides of the head is much less common than going bald on the top."}

{"text":"\nThe evolution of freshwater ecosystems has occurred relatively recently in geological time. The land plants and animals that are now found in freshwater habitats were originally adapted to life on land. The invasion of the land by water produced a new set of problems for terrestrial life forms to solve. The colonization of the air was a prerequisite to the invasion of the land by plants and animals. The invasion of freshwater habitats by plants and animals has been much more recent. The colonization of freshwater ecosystems by land plants and animals was dependent on the evolution of new adaptations to the physical and chemical conditions of freshwater (summarized in Falkowski & Raven, 1998).\n\nAbout 70% of the Earth's surface is covered by oceans. The remaining 30% is land. However, more than 97% of all the Earth's water is found in the oceans. This means that only 3% of the Earth's water is found on land. The majority of this water is frozen in the polar ice caps. Another 2% of the Earth's water is found in rivers and lakes. This leaves only 1% of the Earth's water available for our use as drinking water."}

Delusions often involve situations that could happen, but are very unlikely.\n\nHallucinations. These involve seeing, hearing, tasting, or smelling something that isn't there. However, people with schizophrenia often know that what they are experiencing isn't real.\n\nNegative symptoms. These are associated with disruptions to normal behavior and emotions. These symptoms make it hard to do everyday tasks. They include:\n\nApathy. This is a lack of interest in life. People with this symptom don't enjoy life. They don't feel excited about anything.\n\nAnhedonia. This is the inability to feel pleasure. People with this symptom don't enjoy things that they used to.\n\nAvolition.

{"text":"\n\nScars are areas of fibrous tissue that replace normal skin after injury. A scar results from the biological process of wound repair in the skin and other tissues of the body. Scarring is a natural part of the healing process. With the exception of very minor lesions, every wound (e.g. after accident, disease, or surgery) results in some degree of scarring. While there are many different types of scars, they are generally classified into two main categories: atrophic and hypertrophic scars. Hypertrophic scars are typically red, raised, and firm. They can be itchy and painful, and may even restrict movement or function depending on where they are located on the body. By contrast, atrophic scars are often sunken or pitted. They can result in a crater-like appearance in the skin, and are most commonly associated with acne and chickenpox.\n\nWhen the skin is wounded and there is tissue loss, the body works to heal the wound. The way in which the skin heals may differ depending on the depth of the wound. Superficial wounds, such as abrasions, generally heal without scarring. The reason for this is that the skin is able to regenerate the lost tissue. By contrast, deep wounds may leave behind a scar, because the original tissue cannot be regenerated. Instead, the body produces a protein called collagen to help close the wound. Collagen is a fibrous protein that helps give the skin its strength and flexibility. It is produced by special cells called fibroblasts, which also help to form the scaffolding onto which new tissue can grow.\n\nThe amount of collagen produced by fibroblasts varies from person to person, depending on age, sex, and race. The body tries to match the amount of collagen produced to the amount of tissue lost. Therefore, if the wound is small, the body produces a small amount of collagen. If the wound is large, the body produces a large amount of collagen. The collagen binds the wound and helps it to heal. In some cases, the body produces too much collagen. This is what happens in hypertrophic scars. By contrast, if the body produces too little collagen, the scar may be sunken or pitted. This is known as atrophic scarring.\n\nIn the case of atrophic scars, the fibroblasts do not regenerate enough collagen. This may be due to the fact that the fibroblasts themselves were damaged by the wound, or that the body's immune system destroys the fibroblasts. The latter can occur in the case of acne, for example, where the body's immune system may actually attack the fibroblasts, mistaking them for foreign invaders. There are several treatments available for atrophic scars, including chemical peels, dermabrasion, and laser therapy. In the case of hypertrophic scars, the body produces too much collagen. This may be due to the fact that the fibroblasts were damaged, or that the body's immune system triggered the overproduction of collagen. There are several treatments available for hypertrophic scars, including steroid injections, cryotherapy, and laser therapy."}

The Nordic model is characterized by a strong emphasis on social welfare, collective bargaining, and labor market flexibility. Scandinavian countries have high levels of union membership, and labor unions play a significant role in economic and social policy. The Nordic model also places a strong emphasis on gender equality, which is reflected in the high levels of gender equality in Scandinavian societies.\n\nHowever, the Nordic model also has its drawbacks. Scandinavian countries have relatively high levels of income tax and social security contributions, which can be a burden for individuals and businesses. The strong social safety net also tends to discourage work, which can lead to high levels of unemployment and social exclusion. Additionally, the Nordic model is not immune to the challenges of globalization, and Scandinavian countries have experienced significant economic changes and social challenges in recent years.\n\nOverall, Scandinavian countries have achieved high levels of social progress and quality of life through a combination of strong social welfare policies, high levels of union membership, and a focus on gender equality.

{"text":"\nThe tides were certainly larger when the moon was closer to Earth. How much larger is not clear. The tide is caused by the gravity of the moon pulling the oceans towards the moon. The closer the moon is, the greater the pull. But the rotation of the Earth also matters.  A point on the equator is  pulled more strongly toward the moon than a point near the poles. Thus the oceans near the poles are not pulled as strongly as the oceans near the equator. Because the Earth is rotating, points on the surface are moving from the poles toward the equator. This reduces the distance between the Earth and the Moon. Thus, the tides were greatest when the Earth and Moon were formed. They have been decreasing ever since."}

{"text":"\n\nFemale ejaculation is a real thing. It's also completely normal. The only difference between female ejaculation and male ejaculation is that males ejaculate their sperm. Women release a thin, milky fluid that some people mistake for urine. This fluid is made by the Skene glands, located near a woman's urethra, and it contains no sperm. Women can also experience ejaculation during solo sex or while getting a hand job. The amount of fluid released varies from woman to woman, and it's usually only a few drops.\n\nAlthough female ejaculation is perfectly healthy, it can be messy. Some women worry that they're urinating when they ejaculate. But if you're not sure, there are a few ways to tell the difference. First, urine is clearer and has a more pungent smell than female ejaculate. Second, when you ejaculate, you should feel a strong sensation of pleasure and release. If you're not sure whether you're urinating or ejaculating, try paying attention to your body's responses during sex. If you feel a strong sense of pleasure and release, you're probably ejaculating.

{"text":"\nThe behavior of light is described by a wave equation, the solutions of which are waveforms such as sine waves, sawtooth waves, triangle waves, etc. There are also more complex waveforms such as square waves and ramp waves. Different sources of light may have different waveforms. For example, a laser produces light with a very narrow frequency spectrum, and thus a very \"pure\" sine wave. An incandescent bulb produces light with a frequency spectrum that has several peaks and valleys, so its waveform is more like a sawtooth wave. In principle, a waveform of any shape is possible, although in practice we only ever see a subset of all possible waveforms. The frequency and wavelength of light are related by the wave equation, so if the waveform changes, the frequency or wavelength must also change. Thus, light with a square wave or sawtooth wave waveform would have a more complicated frequency spectrum, and it would interact differently with matter. The propagation of light would also be affected, since the wave equation relates the frequency and wavelength to the velocity and refractive index of light."}

It also is flexible, transparent, and inexpensive to produce. These properties make graphene an ideal material for use in everything from cell phones to aircraft. Yet despite its potential, graphene has not yet lived up to the hype. One of the reasons for this is that graphene is very difficult to utilize. It takes a great deal of time and effort to make graphene usable for any given application.\n\nGraphene is a two-dimensional material, meaning it is made up of a single layer of atoms. This makes it extremely thin and flexible, but also makes it very difficult to handle. It is so thin that it can easily wrinkle or tear, and it is so flexible that it can easily slip out of place. This makes it very difficult to work with and to integrate into devices.\n\nAnother challenge with graphene is that it is not a good conductor of electricity. While it is a great conductor of heat, it is a poor conductor of electricity. This means that it cannot be used as a traditional semiconductor, which is essential for many applications. Instead, researchers have had to develop new methods for using graphene in electronics.\n\nDespite these challenges, researchers are working hard to find ways to utilize graphene. New methods for handling and manipulating graphene are being developed, and new ways to use it in electronics are being explored.

{"text":"\nIn 2012, the discovery of the Higgs boson made headlines around the world. For many, this confirmed the Standard Model - our current best theory describing the fundamental particles and forces in the Universe - was correct. However, there is still much we don't know. The Standard Model doesn't explain all the matter in the Universe, nor does it give a complete description of dark matter, a form of matter we know exists but which we still know very little about. \n\nWhat's more, the Standard Model is incompatible with Einstein's theory of gravity, general relativity. This is a problem, as the two theories are likely to be part of a bigger theory describing everything in the Universe. One of the main goals of the LHC is to find this missing piece. There are also other theories, which go beyond the Standard Model, that could potentially be discovered at the LHC. \n\nOne exciting possibility is the existence of extra spatial dimensions. The idea of extra dimensions was first proposed in the 1920s to resolve inconsistencies in Einstein's theory of gravity. Since then, extra dimensions have been used to explain the existence of dark matter and to create the concept of string theory, which describes everything in the Universe in terms of strings of energy. The LHC might be able to produce dark matter particles, which would give us a clearer picture of what's going on.\n\nAnother possibility is that the LHC will discover supersymmetry. This is another theory that extends the Standard Model, and could be the key to unifying general relativity with the Standard Model. If the LHC discovers supersymmetry, it will revolutionize our understanding of the Universe. We might also discover new heavy particles that don't fit in the Standard Model at all. These could be the key to creating a new theory that unifies all the fundamental forces. \n\nSo while the LHC was created with the primary goal of discovering the Higgs boson, it could still have a big role to play in finding the key to a theory of everything."}

{"text":"\nThe laws of thermodynamics prevent heat pumps from working in a refrigerator. Heat always flows from a hotter to a colder place. That's why a refrigerator will get warm if you leave it closed while the motor is off: the heat flows in from the surrounding air. But inside a refrigerator, the heat from the air is already gone. What remains is the heat produced by the motor, the compressor, and all the other electrical and mechanical stuff that makes a refrigerator work. There's nowhere for that heat to go, so it builds up. A heat pump could reverse that process, but only if there's a colder place to take the heat from.\n\nA refrigerator works by taking heat out of the refrigerator box and dumping it into the coils at the back or bottom of the refrigerator. Those coils are hot to the touch. If you put your hand on them, you'll feel the heat. But that heat is only there because there's no other place for the heat to go. If you could hook up the coils to a heat pump, you could get cooling much more efficiently. The heat would flow out of the coils and into the heat pump, which would dump it into the surrounding air.\n\nBut that's not possible. The heat pump would only be able to do its job if it were colder outside the refrigerator than inside. If it were colder outside, then putting a heat pump on the coils would be exactly the same as putting a cooler outside the refrigerator. It would be more efficient, but it would be just as useless."}
{"text":"\nHormones regulate a lot of different processes in the human body.  They can affect your growth, your metabolism, and even your behavior. They can also change the way your body shapes itself, including your face. \n\nFor example, if you have too much or too little growth hormone, you might end up with a bigger or smaller head. If your thyroid gland is not working correctly, it can affect the shape of your eyebrows and the way your cheeks look. \n\nSome people are born with structural problems that are the result of how their faces form before they are born. For example, some people are born with a cleft lip or palate. Others have a facial cleft that makes one side of their face look different from the other. This can happen if the cells that are supposed to make the face look symmetrical, don't work correctly. \n\nThe good news is that there are treatments that can fix many of these problems. For example, doctors can often fix a cleft lip or palate with surgery. They can also fix a facial cleft with surgery, although the results might not be perfect. \n\nSo, if you are worried about the way your face looks, talk to your doctor. There might be a medical reason for it, and there might be something you can do about it."}
{"text":"\nI am not a neuroscientist or neuropsychologist, so I'm not qualified to give a definitive answer. However, I can offer some speculation based on what I have read and what I know about the brain.\n\nOne possibility is that the brain is constantly storing and processing information, even when we are not consciously aware of it. This could be related to the concept of \"brain plasticity,\" which refers to the ability of the brain to adapt and change throughout life. It seems plausible that our brains are constantly learning and storing new information, even if we are not consciously aware of it.\n\nAnother possibility is that our brains are simply more efficient at storing memories as we get older. This could be related to the fact that our brains tend to shrink as we age, which could result in more efficient storage of memories.\n\nUltimately, it is not clear what the brain is doing with all of the extra space before we start storing memories. It is possible that the answer will vary from person to person, depending on their unique experiences and brain development."}

{"text":"\n\nIt is a common belief that cavities are a rapidly progressive disease that, if left untreated, will destroy a tooth in a matter of months. This, however, is not true. In reality, dental decay is a very slow process that takes many years to reach completion. It is also a largely reversible disease.\n\nTooth decay is caused by acids that are produced by bacteria in the mouth. These bacteria feed on sugar and other carbohydrates and produce waste in the form of an acid that can dissolve the hard tissues of the teeth (enamel, dentine, and cementum). Saliva contains minerals that can reverse this process, a process called remineralization. When demineralization occurs faster than remineralization, a cavity is formed. The process is usually not noticeable to the patient until the cavity is quite large and starts to cause symptoms such as toothache.\n\nThis is why cavities, if caught early, can be healed naturally. It is only when they have reached a late stage that they require a filling."}
{"text":"\n\nHuman mouths are home to hundreds of species of microbes. Many of them feed on food particles left in the mouth after eating. But what about food that gets stuck between our teeth? It's a bit trickier for our spit to reach it there, and that can lead to plaque buildup and tooth decay. That's why we invented the toothbrush. The first bristle toothbrush resembled a brush used for cleaning bottles, with bristles made from horse hair. But it was so hard on the gums that it was later replaced with a softer bristle. Plaque still forms on teeth, but the bacteria that feed on it have evolved in response to our use of toothbrushes. They are now more virulent, producing acids that dissolve enamel more quickly. The rate of tooth decay has gone down, but the price we pay is increased risk of gum disease."}

{"text":"\nTrue north and magnetic north are close to each other, but not exactly aligned. The difference between true north and magnetic north is called magnetic declination or magnetic variation, and this difference varies depending on location. This variation angle changes over time and is not fixed.\n\nIn the United States, magnetic declination generally ranges from 20 degrees west in Maine, to 20 degrees east in Washington State. Since 1831, the magnetic north pole has moved over 1,400 kilometers (870 miles) from the geographic north pole. The magnetic pole is currently (2020) moving approximately 55 kilometers (34 miles) per year towards the geographic north pole.\n\nIn the United States, NGA (National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency) provides annual updates to the World Magnetic Model. This model is the standard geomagnetic model used for navigation by the U.S. Department of Defense, the U.S. Intelligence Community, and NATO. The WMM is also used widely in civilian navigation and aviation.\n\nIt is \"lucky\" that the difference between true north and magnetic north is relatively small. If the difference between true north and magnetic north were larger, the WMM and navigation tools would be less accurate. In addition, the Earth's magnetic field is changing over time, and the rate of change is increasing. In the future, the difference between true north and magnetic north will increase, and this will likely have an impact on navigation."}

The same goes for dark matter. The amount of energy needed to create a black hole might be greater than the amount of energy released by its Hawking radiation, so the black hole would be a net energy sink. As the universe expands and matter becomes more diffuse, there would be fewer opportunities for black holes to form."}
{"text":"\n\nHemp is a miraculous plant with over 25,000 potential product applications. It can be used to produce a variety of goods, including concrete, insulation, and even diapers. This means that hemp could potentially replace dozens of products that are currently being produced with non-renewable resources. In addition, hemp is much cheaper to grow and process than other crops, such as cotton, so it could potentially be a cheaper option for many products. However, hemp does have some challenges to overcome before it can truly be considered a replacement for many products. For example, the current infrastructure for processing and manufacturing hemp products is not as developed as it is for other crops. This means that it would likely take time and investment to build up the necessary infrastructure to support a large-scale hemp industry. Additionally, hemp is still not legal in all 50 states, so it would need to become legal at the federal level before it could truly be considered a viable replacement for many products. Despite these challenges, hemp remains a promising option for replacing non-renewable resources and could potentially be a cheaper and more environmentally friendly alternative to many products."}
{"text":"\n\nWhen it comes to cleaning effectiveness, there is a clear difference between a regular manual toothbrush and an electric one. Research has shown that electric toothbrushes are more effective at removing plaque, which is a sticky film of bacteria that builds up on teeth. Plaque is a major cause of tooth decay and gum disease, so using an electric toothbrush can help to reduce the risk of these problems.\n\nElectric toothbrushes also tend to be more effective at cleaning the hard-to-reach areas of the mouth, such as the back teeth and the gum line. This is because they have a rotating or oscillating head that helps to loosen plaque and debris from the teeth.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that not all electric toothbrushes are created equal. Some models are better than others at removing plaque, and some may be too aggressive for certain people, such as those with sensitive teeth or gum recession.\n\nIt is also important to remember that brushing technique and frequency are still important factors in maintaining good oral hygiene. No matter what type of toothbrush you use, it is important to brush your teeth for two minutes twice a day, using a soft-bristled brush and fluoride toothpaste."}
{"text":"\n\nThe air around us is mostly nitrogen and oxygen, with almost 1% argon and even smaller amounts of carbon dioxide and other gases. The water vapor content of air varies, but is typically around 1%. At any given moment, the atmosphere contains about 3,000,000 lightning discharges, a number that has been estimated based on the frequency of lightning flashes. Since the air is such an efficient insulator, most of the charges created by these discharges are unable to find their way to the ground. A connection to the ground is the fastest path to zero potential, and the most important factor in determining where a discharge will occur is the potential difference between the charged region and the ground. Since mountain peaks are closer to the upper regions of the atmosphere, it is sometimes, but not always, true that they will be closer to the charged regions, and thus, closer to the opposite polarity of the charge. Thus, if the potential difference is great enough, it is possible for a mountain top to be struck by lightning."}
{"text":"\n\nWhen you heat air, it expands and becomes less dense. This is why hot air rises and why helium balloons float. Hot air is less dense than the surrounding atmosphere. This is also why mountains can get higher. As tectonic plates push Earth's crust upwards, the rock becomes heated. It expands and rises, often pushing through the atmosphere and leaving mountains bare. When the rock cools and contracts, mountains erode and valleys form.\n\nWhat about heat transfer by conduction? In that case, the hotter object transfers heat to the cooler one. For example, when you touch a hot object with your hand, heat transfers from the object to your hand. Your hand heats up, and the object cools down. The same is true for heat transfer through radiation. When the Sun heats the Earth, the Earth's surface radiates heat back into space. The atmosphere traps some of that heat, making the Earth's atmosphere hotter than the surface. But still, hot air rises. Why?"}

{"text":"\n\nThe Earth's atmosphere has a lot of gases in it. The exact mix of gases doesn't matter for this problem, but it's probably easiest to assume that it's mostly nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2). Those are non-reactive gases, so they don't burn. If you put them under enough pressure, they'll stay in their gaseous state, even at very high temperatures. But the Earth's atmosphere is not under enough pressure for nitrogen or oxygen to stay in their gaseous state at the kinds of temperatures we're talking about.\n\nWe know this because the Earth's atmosphere does, in fact, burn. It's called atmospheric reentry, and it's what spacecraft have to deal with when they come back to Earth. When a spacecraft reenters the Earth's atmosphere, it's traveling very, very fast. Faster than the speed of sound. But the atmosphere is still only about 100 kilometers (60 miles) thick. So it can't slow down as fast as the spacecraft can. The spacecraft basically plunges through the atmosphere, building up heat until it burns up. This happens at altitudes of hundreds of kilometers, and it doesn't take very high temperatures to cause it. At an altitude of 100 kilometers, the temperature of the atmosphere is around 1500\u00b0C (2700\u00b0F).\n\nSo, if you increased the temperature of the Earth's atmosphere to around 2700\u00b0F, it would catch on fire. That's hotter than iron melts, which is how we smelt iron until we figured out how to do it with a blast furnace. It's hotter than volcanoes can get. It's hotter than a blast furnace, which is about 1200\u00b0C (2190\u00b0F). It's even hotter than the surface of the sun, which is \"only\" about 5500\u00b0C (9000\u00b0F).\n\nSo, it's definitely possible to ignite the Earth's atmosphere. It's just a matter of getting it hot enough. How hot would it have to be? That depends on how thick you make the atmosphere. The Earth's atmosphere is about 100 kilometers (60 miles) thick. To raise the temperature of the whole thing to 2700\u00b0C (which is what the spacecraft reenters the atmosphere at) would take:\n\nSo, it would take about 6500\u00b0C (10,000\u00b0F) of heat to ignite the Earth's atmosphere. That's hotter than the surface of the sun. In fact, it's hotter than any natural process we know of. It's hotter than the center of the Earth, which is about 6000\u00b0C (10,800\u00b0F). It's even hotter than nuclear fusion, which is what powers the sun and stars."}
{"text":"\nThere are several possible explanations for why large creatures might be more likely to go extinct than small ones. One possibility is that large creatures require more resources to survive, such as food and water, and these resources may be more difficult to find or access in a changing environment. Another possibility is that large creatures are more vulnerable to predators and other threats in the wild, and may be less able to adapt to changing conditions. Finally, it is also possible that large creatures simply have a lower reproductive rate than smaller ones, which makes them less able to recover from population declines. Ultimately, it is likely that multiple factors, including some or all of these possibilities, contribute to the higher extinction risk faced by large creatures."}

If this theory holds true, then Earth isn't the only planet in our solar system with a sizeable cache of these valuable commodities. \n\n\"Our work shows that rocky planets around more massive stars are promising places to look for heavy metals,\" said lead author Farhang Nabiei, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Chicago, in a statement. \"That's exciting, because planets in our own solar system, like Mars, don't have the same kind of rocks.\"\n\nMars and Venus probably don't have a similar distribution of these ores, according to the researchers.
