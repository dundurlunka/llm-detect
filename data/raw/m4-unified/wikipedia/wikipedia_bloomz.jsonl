{"text":"The William Whitehouse was the first steam-powered ship to be built in Australia, and is now preserved as part of the National Maritime Museum's collection at Darling Harbour on Sydney Waterfront.\nHistory\n\nIn 1839 Captain John Macarthur had been appointed by Governor George Arthur (1790\u20131864) to explore the potential of establishing a settlement near Port Stephens.  In 1840 he returned from his expedition accompanied by two convicts who were sent out under escort by HMS\u00a0Buffalo.   The ships arrived off Stingray Harbor on 9 February 1841 where they found that the convict party led by Lieutenant James Grant had already established themselves there.    On 11 March 1841 Captain Macarthur formally took possession of the land which became known as New South Wales. \nCaptain Macarthur decided to build a boat capable of transporting goods between Sydney and Newcastle via the Clarence River.   He commissioned local carpenter Thomas Dredge to design it but when this proved too difficult Mr Dredge suggested using a model supplied by Robert Fulton.  \nMr Dredge died before construction began so Captain Macarthur employed another local craftsman named Henry Hoddle to complete the work.   It was launched on 1 May 1842 after being christened by Mrs Sarah Macarthur.   She sailed successfully along her intended route until she ran aground during high winds while returning to Sydney harbour.    \nShe was rebuilt again in 1844 and renamed the Lady Juliana.   This time however she sank within sight of Sydney Heads shortly afterwards due to bad weather conditions.   Her final voyage ended tragically when she capsized just outside Sydney Heads killing all aboard including Captain Macarthur himself.\n\nAfter these failures Captain Macarthur turned instead towards building a larger vessel called the SS Great Britain designed by British engineer Richard Trevithick.   However plans fell through because of financial difficulties caused by the collapse of the Bank of NSW and the death of its founder Alexander Hamilton in 1843.  \n\nA new plan emerged involving the purchase of a large steamer then moored in London's Victoria Dockyard belonging to the firm of J & G Wilson.   After negotiations failed Captain Macarthur purchased the hull itself and shipped it back to Sydney where it was reassembled and fitted..."}

{"text":"Centrostephanus besnardi: This species is known from the following localities in Australia: New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria.\nTaxonomy\n\nThe genus Centrostephanus was erected by Stebbing (1912) to accommodate Ctenodrilinae that had previously been placed within other genera such as Pseudocentrodrilus or Centrodrilus.  The type species of this genus is C. australis which has since been synonymised under C. pseudopulchellus.   In his original description he noted that it differed from all other Australian ctenodrilines except C. pseudopulcherlus but did not provide any diagnostic characters.    Subsequently, several authors have described new species based on minor differences between populations without providing any morphological evidence supporting their validity.   For example, C. pseudopulchrillus var. longirostris was described solely because some individuals were slightly longer than others; however there are no significant differences in either body shape or jaw structure between these two forms.     A recent study using molecular techniques found only one genetic lineage present across Australia suggesting that most if not all currently recognised taxa should be considered conspecifics.      However, until further research can resolve taxonomic issues at both specific and generic levels we will continue to use current nomenclature."}

{"text":"The Birlinn was the first steam-powered ship to cross the Atlantic Ocean, and it is considered one of the most important ships in British naval history.\nIn 1761, James Brindley invented the paddle wheel which revolutionised ocean travel by allowing larger vessels than before to sail faster across oceans.  The use of steam power on boats had been tried previously but without success because boilers were too heavy or inefficient.   In 1763 John Smeaton designed a new type of boiler that used water-tight fireboxes instead of flues inside them.    This made possible the development of large steam powered ships such as the Birlinn. \nConstruction began at Bristol's Harbourside Works under Captain Robert Jenkinson who died during construction leaving his son Thomas in charge.   It took four years from start to finish (1765-1769) and cost \u00a360,000 - more expensive then any other vessel built up until this time.   On its maiden voyage between Liverpool and New York City in 1770,  the Birlinn reached speeds never seen before;  crossing the Atlantic in just over three weeks.   During her second trip she ran aground off Vigo after encountering bad weather.   She returned safely to port having lost only two men out of 120 aboard.   After these successful voyages, the Birlinn became famous throughout Europe and America.   However, despite being hailed as \"the greatest steamboat ever constructed\",   the Birlinn proved unreliable when running long distances due to problems with her engines and boilers;   she also suffered severe damage in storms.   Her third journey ended disastrously when she sank near Vigo following another stormy passage.   Despite attempts to refloat her, all hands perished including Captain Jenkinson's widow Sarah.   Following her loss, interest in steam powered ships declined rapidly leading to their abandonment within ten years.    ..."}

{"text":"In mathematics, the convergence of probability measures is one of several types of convergences that can be defined on spaces of functions or distributions.\nThe concept was introduced by \u00c9mile Borel in 1909 and developed further by Fr\u00e9chet (1912), who showed how to define it using sequences of simple functions.  The idea behind this approach is that if we have two different ways of measuring some quantity then their values should agree when averaged over large enough samples; thus any sequence of measurements made according to either measure will eventually become close together as more data are collected.   This type of convergence has been used extensively since its introduction into statistics where it plays a key role in hypothesis testing such as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test which compares empirical distribution functions from sample sets taken from populations whose underlying cumulative distribution functions may differ significantly but still produce similar results under repeated sampling experiments."}

Claire was the first steamship to be built by the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) in 1914, and one of only two ships that were completed before World War I began.\nShe was launched on August 16,\u00a01914 at Quebec City's Saint-Roch Basin as the second ship constructed under CPR president Sir William Van Horne's policy of building large ocean-going vessels capable of carrying passengers across the Atlantic Ocean from Europe to Canada via the Great Lakes.  The other vessel being built during this period was the larger sister ship, the SS Empress of Canada.   She was named after her namesake, Queen Mary V of England who had died just three months earlier.    On September 26,\u00a01915 she set sail from Montreal bound for Liverpool where she arrived October 3.\u00a0On November 15,\u00a0she departed Liverpool again en route back home arriving December 5.\u00a0In 1917, she made another voyage between Britain and North America but did not return until 1919 when she resumed service along the same route which she would maintain throughout most of her career.   In 1927, she underwent repairs following damage sustained while crossing Lake Ontario due to high winds and rough seas.   During these repairs, her boilers were removed so they could be replaced with more modern types.   After completing them, she returned to service once again.   By 1930 however, it became apparent that the ageing steamer needed replacing.   Her final sailing took place February 18,\u00a01931 when she sailed southbound from Halifax bound for New York City.   Thereafter, she lay idle awaiting scrapping.   Following the outbreak of war in 1939,  she was requisitioned by the Royal Navy and used briefly as a troop transport.   Ultimately though,   she was sold off for scrap metal in 1941.   Notable events aboard include the wedding reception held there for Princess Elizabeth II and Prince Philip Mountbatten in 1947;  and the funeral of Winston Churchill in 1965."}

{"text":"Riversdale is the largest town in South Africa's Eastern Cape Province and lies on the banks of the Mzamba River near its confluence with the Indian Ocean.\nThe town was founded by Huguenot settlers from France who arrived at St Helena Island (now called Saint Helena) off the coast of East London during 1688\u20131689 as part of French privateer Jacques Cassard's fleet.  The name Riversdale comes from the English translation of the Dutch word \"rivierdell\" meaning \"by the river banks\".   It has been suggested that this may be where the first European settlement took place after the arrival of Captain James Cook to the east coast of southern Africa in 1778.    In 1820, it became one of three towns established along the south-east coastline between Port Elizabeth and East London under British rule; these were intended to protect against attacks by Arab slave traders operating out of Zanzibar.   During the Anglo-Zulu War of 1879\u20131881, the town served as headquarters for General Sir Garnet Wolseley\u2019s column which defeated the Zulu army led by King Cetshwayo II at Isandlwana Mountain Pass just outside the town.

{"text":"The Plinian core is the central part of a volcanic eruption column, which consists primarily of pyroclastic material and ash that rises from the vent to form a mushroom cloud or towering plume (see Figure below ). The term \"plinian\" comes from the Latin name for Mount Vesuvius in Italy where this type of eruption was first observed by Aristotle around 300 BC.\nPlinian eruptions are characterized by high volumes of gas-rich magma being released at relatively low pressure into open space above ground level; they can be explosive but not necessarily so.  They may also occur as dome collapses when large amounts of molten rock suddenly escape through cracks within the volcano's edifice.   In either case, the resulting mixture of gases, hot particles, water vapor, and liquid droplets expands rapidly upward under its own weight until it reaches equilibrium between buoyancy forces due to density differences and gravity.    This results in rapid vertical acceleration up to terminal velocities on the order of 100 m\/sec., producing extremely dense clouds of fine particulate matter known as tephra.     These clouds rise quickly toward their maximum height before spreading out horizontally over great distances, often covering areas several hundred kilometers across.   Volcanic plumes produced during these events have been recorded rising more than 30 km (19 mi) above sea-level.    As such, Plinian eruptions pose significant hazards both locally near the source region and globally via atmospheric transport processes."}

The word hab\u014dkushiki literally means \"broad and flat\".   This architectural style originated as a response by aristocrats who were forced into exile after the H\u014dgen Rebellion against Emperor Kammu in 897.    Hab\u014dkushiki buildings are characterized by their broad roofs which extend over several stories.     They also have large windows on all sides so they can be lit naturally throughout most hours of day or night.

{"text":"The Colimaaite is the only known meteorite to have originated from Comet Encke, which orbits between Jupiter and Mars in our solar system.\nIt was discovered on September 16, 1950 by Luis Walter Alvarez (1914\u20131988) at his home near Santa Clara del Cobre, Chihuahua, Mexico while he was looking through some of his father's old mining equipment that had been left behind after his father died.  The name comes from the Mexican state where it fell; colima means \"colima\" or \"colline\" in Spanish.   It has also sometimes been called the \"Chihuahua Meteorite\" because its fall site lies within Chihuahuan Desert territory.    This cometary origin makes this one of very few meteorites whose parent body can be identified as being part of the Solar System's dust cloud.   In addition to having come directly from Comet Encke itself, the Colimaaite contains many minerals found nowhere else but in comets such as carbonates like calcite.     Because of these unique characteristics, scientists are able to use the Colimaaite to study how water may have formed on Earth during Earth's formation 4 billion years ago when Comet Encke collided with the planet.      Scientists believe that if there were any life forms living on Earth back then they would likely not survive the impact caused by the collision of Comet Encke with Earth.

It was first described in 1885 by Leuckart as Dirofilaria immitis; however it had been known to exist since at least 1877 when Dr. George Mellanby reported finding what he called \"larv\u00e6\" in the lungs of two dogs from India who died after being bitten by mosquitoes.\nThe adult worms are large filarial nematodes which live within pulmonary arteries where they feed on blood; their presence causes severe respiratory distress due to right-sided congestive heart failure caused by pressure exerted upon the lung tissue surrounding them.  The larvae develop into microfilariae which circulate freely through the dog's body until ingested by mosquitos during feeding.   Adult female worms lay eggs which hatch inside the intestines of the insect vector before migrating back to the dog via its saliva.   Once mature adults have developed, male and female worms mate and produce more eggs."}

The name is derived from the Greek word \"subulos\" meaning \"hermit\"; it was also used to refer to other groups living outside cities or towns at that time.   They appear to have been influenced by earlier ascetic movements like those led by Saint Anthony the Great and Saint Macarius the Elder.

His second term as prime minister ended abruptly following his defeat in the House of Commons over his proposal that all members should be elected directly rather than indirectly through constituency representatives.   In addition to these two unsuccessful attempts to become British PM,  he also served briefly as Foreign Secretary in 1800-1801 before becoming First Lord of Trade & Plantations until 1802.

{"text":"Skateboards are used by skaters to glide across surfaces, such as pavements and skate parks.\nThe board is usually made of wood or fiberglass covered in grip tape on the underside (called the \"concave\") which allows it to be gripped tightly when riding downhill at high speeds.  The deck can also have concave grooves cut into its surface that allow water drainage during rainy weather.   Skateboard trucks are attached directly onto the bottom side of each end of the board; these provide support while turning.    Wheels are mounted between the truck axles so they roll along the ground beneath them.   Trucks may either be fixed or swiveling depending upon their design.   A variety of wheels exist including plastic urethane wheels, metal alloy wheels, polyurethane foam core wheels, and wooden wheels.   Some boards feature bushings instead of traditional bearings inside the trucks' hanger holes.     Skaters use footwear called \"skate shoes\" to ride skates.   They typically wear knee pads, elbow pads, wrist guards, helmets, goggles, and other protective gear.   There are many different styles of skateboarding; some involve performing tricks off ramps built specifically for this purpose, others focus more on speed and distance traveled down hills without using any obstacles.   Other types include freestyle, street, vert ramp\/street, park\/stadium, half pipe, slalom racing, bowl, dancing, scooter\/scootering, long boarding, surfing, snowboarding, BMX biking, rollerblading, and electric skateboarding.   In addition there are several forms of competition ranging from informal contests held among friends up through professional competitions sanctioned by national governing bodies like USA Roller Sports and ISF.

After graduating from art school, Rockwell moved back home where he found work painting portraits commissioned by local families.   He also started working freelance doing illustrations for magazines such as The Saturday Evening Post.    In 1925, after being rejected by other publishers because of his lack of formal training,  Rockwell accepted a job offer from Henry J. Luce III to illustrate the cover of Time magazine which featured President Calvin Coolidge posing with three farm animals.   His first illustration appeared on May 1, 1927, but it wasn't until 1931 that he created what would become one of his most famous works, \"The Problem We All Live With\"; this image depicted a young mother holding her crying baby next to a gunman pointing a pistol into its head.

The route followed the coastline closely but had several grades which were difficult or impossible to negotiate by train without causing damage.   In order to overcome these obstacles, engineers designed a series of trestles known locally as \"steep grade bridges\".    These structures are still visible today although only one remains intact;  all others have been demolished over time due to their poor condition and\/or lack of use after the construction of new roadways nearby.

The name comes from French physicists Jean-Baptiste Biot and F\u00e9lix Savart who first observed it in rock samples collected near Paris in 1842.

The fungus infects living tissue through wounds or natural openings such as lenticels; it then grows into the sapwood where it forms stromatic structures called perithecia containing ascii filled with eight ascospores each.  These spores may be dispersed by wind currents over long distances from parent tree infections.   Infected trees often show no symptoms until they become stressed due to drought conditions or other environmental factors.    Symptoms include wilting leaves followed by death of branches and\/or entire trunks.     Control measures involve removing diseased material and treating wounds made during pruning operations using copper-based compounds like Bordeaux mixture."}

{"text":"The Black Spades were the first black nationalist organization in Germany, founded by students at the University of Hamburg and other universities across northern Europe during World War II.\nHistory\n\nIn 1933, when Hitler came to power,  many German Jews emigrated from Nazi Germany.  Many left behind their children who had grown up speaking Yiddish or Hebrew as well as German.   These young people became known as \"Jews without Jews\" (Juden ohne Juden).   They faced discrimination because they spoke languages associated with Jewishness but did not have any religious beliefs that would make them subject to persecution under Nazism.    The Black Spades was formed on May 1, 1943 after several meetings between members of these groups.   It is believed that the name originated from the fact that its founders wore dark clothing while carrying out attacks against Germans.\n\nActivities\n\nDuring the war years it carried out numerous acts of sabotage including arson, bombings, assassinations, kidnappings, robberies, thefts, and murdering civilians.   Its activities included attacking police stations, banks, post offices, railway lines, factories producing weapons used by the Wehrmacht, military facilities such as air bases, naval ports, army depots, radio transmitters, telephone exchanges, electrical substations, bridges, highways, train tracks, gasoline storage tanks, and even civilian hostages.   In addition there are reports of Black Spade involvement in smuggling arms into occupied France through Spain.

{"text":"The term ethnodoctrinalism is used to describe the belief that one's ethnic group has certain beliefs, values and practices which are superior or more authentic than those of other groups.\nEthnodoctrinalists believe their own culture's religious traditions should be followed by all members of society regardless of individual conscience; they also tend to reject any foreign influences on their religion as being inferior.  Ethnodoctrinalist religions often have strict codes regarding dress, diet, sexual behavior etc., in order to maintain purity from outside influence.   The concept was first developed during the 19th century when European missionaries began converting non-European peoples into Christianity.    In some cases this conversion process involved replacing indigenous cultures' traditional spirituality (e.g. animistic) with Christianity; however it can also refer to situations where converts were expected to abandon aspects of their native culture such as language, clothing, customs, music, dance, food preparation methods, family structures, social organization systems, political institutions, economic activities, art forms, rituals, cosmologies, world views and\/or sacred sites.     Some scholars argue that many modern-day evangelical Protestant churches exhibit characteristics consistent with ethnodoctrinalism:  For example, Evangelicals may insist upon following specific liturgy, preaching styles, musical tastes, dietary preferences, modes of worship, dress code, gender roles within church life, child rearing techniques, educational curricula, and so forth.       ..."}

{"text":"Asaph Whittlesey (August 16, 1785 \u2013 September 26, 1869) was the first American to build and fly his own airplane in 1903.  He also invented several other aircraft-related devices including the gyroscope.   Asaph's brother Benjamin Franklin Whiteside is credited as being one of America's earliest aviators but he did not design or construct any airplanes himself.    The brothers were born on August 16, 1785 at their father's farm near Hampstead, New Hampshire where they lived until moving to Boston when Asaph was 12 years old.   They moved back to Hampstead after Benjamin died from tuberculosis while serving in the Union Army during the Civil War.\nWhittlesey graduated from Harvard College in 1901 and worked briefly before becoming interested in aviation.   In 1902 he began experimenting with gliders that used kite-like tails instead of conventional tail surfaces.   His designs incorporated many features later adopted by Wright Brothers' Flyer such as:  wing warping;   elevators mounted above the wings rather than below them;    fixed landing gear;    and ailerons attached directly to each wingtip.   After building two successful glider models,  Whittlesey constructed what has been described as \"the world's most advanced single-place open cockpit biplane ever built\":  the Aerial Experiment No. 1.   On May 24, 1903 it flew successfully over the Charles River in Cambridge Massachusetts under control of its pilot who had no previous experience flying.   It was the first time anyone had flown a plane designed entirely by themselves without assistance from European engineers.   This event made him famous around the world although some critics questioned whether he actually flew the plane since there are conflicting reports about how much help he received from others during this flight."}

It is only one year since they lost out narrowly against Tyrone but it seems that their confidence has been restored as they have now won four straight minor titles.   The final score line reflects how close both sides are matched up front where there will be no shortage of talent over the next few years.    This game also marked the first time ever that two teams had scored more than 50 points each in an all-ireland decider.     In spite of being beaten again by Cork last season, Kilkenny still managed to retain most of their team which included future inter-county stars such as Mickey Harte, Johnny McDonnell, Mick O'Dwyer and Paddy Kelly who would go onto win five All-Stars between them during their careers.      On paper, Kilkenny's best chance lay in beating Cork once again in the semi-final but unfortunately for them, things did not quite work out like that.  \n\nKilkenny started off well enough when Pat Ryan opened the scoring early in the second half before Kevin McCarthy replied for Cork just three minutes later.  However, despite having the better chances throughout the remainder of the match,  Kilkenny could never get back into contention and eventually fell short by six points. \n\nIn the other semi final, Ulster defeated Leinster 2-17 to 3-10 while Connacht beat Munster 5-18 to 4-12 in what turned out to be another classic encounter between these counties.\n\nUlster made light work of Leinster thanks largely to goalscorer Jim McGarry whose tally of 1-5 helped his side secure victory without too much difficulty.

{"text":"Sempronius Densus (died c. AD 100) was the first Roman governor of Britain, appointed by Emperor Claudius in AD 43 to replace Julius Agricola who had died during his invasion of Caledonia.\nDensus is known only from inscriptions and coins; he appears on some British coinage as \"Dentatus\" or \"Danistus\".  He may have been born at Lugdunum in Gaul but there are no records that show where exactly.   His name means \"thick-set\"; it has also been suggested that this refers to his stature rather than weight.    The earliest surviving record of him dates back to AD 49 when he served under Vespasian's son Titus in Germany.   In AD 62 he returned to Rome after serving under Nero's successor Galba.   Afterwards we know nothing about Sempronius until AD 73 when he became praetor peregrinus - a position which allowed him to travel abroad without being bound by any particular province.   During his tenure as praetor peregrine he fought against Germanic tribes along the Rhine before returning home again in AD 75.   It seems likely then that he would be sent out to Britain shortly afterwards.   There were two other governors named Sempronius between Densus' appointment and Agricola's death so it cannot be said whether he replaced one of them or not.   However, if he did succeed someone else, they must either never have left their post or have died soon after arriving because there is no evidence of anyone having held office while Densus was away.

He had been one of our leading architects since he began practice in London about twenty-five years ago; but it has always seemed to me that what made him stand out from other men who have practised architecture during this period were two qualities which are not often found together \u2014 originality combined with restraint.   His buildings show great imagination without extravagance or pretentiousness; they combine beauty of form with simplicity of detail; yet there is never any attempt at display or bravura effects; everything seems perfectly natural because every part serves its purpose well.    In recent years Mr Limmer\u2019s work included many important schools such as those at Walthamstow, Harrow-on-the-Hill, Cheltenham Ladies\u2019 College, and Merchant Taylors' School for Girls, Northwood Hills Road, all of them distinguished by their fine proportions and dignified character.     It may be said too that although Mr Limmer did much excellent work outside London, none of these works attracted so wide attention as some of his earlier designs like the new school building at Tonbridge Grammar School where he showed how beautifully simple forms can express themselves when used with tasteful decoration.      But perhaps I should say more than anything else that Mr Limmer will be remembered most highly for having done something towards restoring architectural standards among us.  For while we cannot deny that modern methods of construction make possible wonderful results both in design and execution, still it must be admitted that sometimes the desire to achieve novelty leads people into strange excesses.  And here again Mr Limmer set a good example by showing that if you want your buildings to look attractive..."}

The genus was named after the Greek goddess Helen who married Menelaus.

{"text":"The East Penn Railroad Company was incorporated in Pennsylvania on March 31, 1846 by the merger of several smaller railroads and companies that had been operating along its route since 1838.  The company's first line ran from Philadelphia to Allentown via Reading (1846), then extended southward through Lancaster County into York County where it connected at Port Clinton Junction near present-day Karthaus Township.   In 1852, the railroad reached Harrisburg;  two years later, it reached Carthaus Township.    By 1860, the railway system included lines extending as far west as Pittsburgh and north to Erie.\nIn 1864, the Pennsylvania General Assembly granted the EPRR exclusive rights over all roads within 10 miles (16 km) of any point served by one of their tracks.   This act gave them control over most rural highways throughout eastern Pennsylvania until they were replaced by state highways during the 20th century.   It also allowed them to build branch lines without competition.   During this period, the company built many new branches including those leading east toward Gettysburg and Chambersburg, and west towards Altoona and Wilkes-Barre\/Scranton.   They also constructed numerous bridges across streams such as the Susquehanna River between Harrisburg and Middletown, which is still standing today.   On December 1, 1867, the name of the corporation changed to \"The Pennsylvania Railway Company\";   however, the old name continued to be used informally among locals who referred to \"the roads\" or simply \"the tracks\".   After acquiring additional land grants from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the PRR expanded further into western Pennsylvania reaching Scranton in 1872 and Cumberland Gap in 1876.   Between 1877 and 1883, the PRR completed construction of the Lehigh Valley Extension connecting the mainline directly to Bethlehem Steel Works located just outside of Allentown.

{"text":"The French corvette Diligent was built in 1801 at Rochefort, France and launched on 16 May 1802 under the command of Captain de la Motte-Picquet.  She had been ordered by Napoleon Bonaparte to be used as his personal ship during his expedition against Egypt.   The vessel's name is derived from the Latin word diligens meaning \"quickly moving or active\"; it also refers to her speedy sailing qualities.    On 9 July 1798, she left Toulon carrying troops destined for Egypt; they arrived off Alexandria on 1 August after which the crew were sent ashore while the captain remained aboard to negotiate terms with the Egyptian authorities.   After negotiations failed he returned to the boat but found that most of its crew had deserted; only one man remained who refused to leave until the rest came back.   He then sailed away leaving the captain stranded without any men to sail the ship.   This incident became known as the Aboukir disaster when the British captured the vessel later that day.   In 1799, the vessel was renamed La Diligente before being rebuilt into a larger warship called Le H\u00e9ros.   During this time, the original hull lay abandoned near Alexandria where it was discovered by Lieutenant James Bruce who bought it from the Arabs.   It was restored to service in 1803 and commissioned once again as La Diligente.   Her new owners decided not to use her as a private yacht so instead sold her to the East India Company.   Between 1804 and 1807 she served as their flagship in several battles including those fought around Vigo and Vigo itself.   At some point between 1808-1809 she was converted into a merchantman named L'Indien.   She continued serving as such up until 1811 when she ran aground off Saint Helena and sank there."}

The court had also ordered him to pay damages totalling MVR500 million (US$4.6 million) to former Prime Minister Maumoon Abdul Gayyoom who he had sacked from office after accusing him of embezzlement.   In response,  Mohamed Nasheed announced plans to hold fresh elections later than planned as well as introducing new legislation which would have allowed him to remain in power beyond his term limit.    On 5 October,   Mohamed Nasheed called upon Parliament to convene early so they could vote on these measures; however,    only 12 MPs attended out of the total of 65 members.
