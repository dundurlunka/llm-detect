{"text":"\nWe consider a system of many polymers in solution that interact via an external force that is applied to each pair of polymers. We study the statistical equilibrium of this system, and find that the polymers form clusters whose sizes are given by a power law distribution. This is in contrast to the traditional picture of polymers in solution, where the thermodynamic equilibrium is described by a mean-field theory based on the solution of the mean-field Boltzmann equation. We show that this difference is due to a breakdown of the assumptions that were used to derive the mean-field theory. In particular, we show that the polymer-polymer interactions in the system considered are non-local, and are thus not described by the mean-field theory. We then derive a new theory for the statistical equilibrium in the presence of an external force, which includes a correction to the mean-field theory. The new theory predicts that the polymer clusters become less dense as the external force increases, in clear contrast to the predictions of the mean-field theory. We analyze this disagreement, and show that it is due to the fact that the mean-field theory predicts a non-monotonic dependence of the polymer-polymer interaction strength on the external force, while our theory predicts a strictly monotonic dependence. We then consider the limit of our theory as the number of polymers in the system tends to infinity, and show that it describes a model of polymer quantum mechanics in a Box, which is a system with a large number of infinitely-lived polymers that interact via a non-local potential, and are in statistical equilibrium in the presence of an external force. We analyze this model, and show that it describes a system with anomalous diffusion and ballistic transport, which is analogous to the anomalous behavior observed in recent experiments on pedestrians."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a catalog of 66 YSOs in the Serpens cloud, as observed with IRAC and MIPS, and discuss their properties in the context of the cloud as a whole. We show that the distribution of the YSOs is well described by a simple model in which the cloud is treated as a uniform one-dimensional structure. We derive a total mass for the cloud of 4 x 10^4 solar masses, with an age of 1-2 Gyr. We discuss the evolution of the cloud and show that a significant fraction of the cloud's gas has been lost through interaction with the Galactic potential. We find that the cloud is both massive and dense enough to have retained its identity as a discrete cloud for several billion years, in spite of these interactions. We show that the observed distribution of YSOs in the cloud is consistent with a model in which the YSOs are born in a narrow, punctuated shell and are distributed according to the primordial distribution function. We discuss the cloud's three-dimensional structure and show that a simple model in which the cloud is treated as a uniform one-dimensional structure provides a good description of the cloud's major properties. We briefly discuss the possible mechanisms for the formation of the cloud and the subsequent evolution of its YSO population."}
{"text":"\n\nSpectroscopic Observations of the Intermediate Polar EX Hydrae in Quiescence\n\nWe present a photometric and spectroscopic study of the intermediate polar star EX Hydrae in quiescence. We find that the star's radial velocity variations observed during quiescence are due to magnetic activity along the stellar rotational meridian. We model the observed variations with a simple empirical model in which the active region is placed at a single latitude, and we show that this model can quantitatively reproduce the observations. We discuss a physical mechanism for this activity which is consistent with the behavior observed on the Sun: a strong temperature gradient along the magnetic field lines forces the appearance of a chimney-like structure, which then triggers the formation of sunspots in the photosphere. The activity cycle in EX Hydrae has a periodicity of about 5 years and is in phase with the stellar rotation period. Our results suggest that stellar activity can be excited by the same physical mechanism along the entire rotational meridian at latitudes far from the equator, even in cases where the stellar magnetic field is relatively weak."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a new class of stochastic Lie group integrators that is suitable for integration of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with nonlinear noise and that generalizes the class of stochastic Stratonovich integrators. The main idea is to use the analogy between the integration of SDEs and the integration of differential equations (DEs) with nonlinear right-hand sides. The key steps are the representation of the solution of the SDE as a probabilistic evolution of a functional on the Lie algebra of the Lie group, the use of the associated stochastic differential operator on the Lie algebra, and the use of the resulting Stratonovich integrator to approximate the solution of the SDE. We show that this class of integrators is applicable to a large class of stochastic Lie groups and that it provides a generalization of the class of stochastic Stratonovich integrators to the case of nonlinear noise. Within this general framework, we derive several specific integrators, and we show how to obtain an approximation by a suitable ensemble of probability measures. We analyze the properties of the method, and we present several examples and numerical tests."}
{"text":"\n\nALMA as the ideal probe of the solar chromosphere\nWe present a detailed study of the solar chromosphere, based on ALMA observations of the HCl (at 1.3 mm and 2.8 mm) and HCO+(at 3.3 mm and 7 mm) lines. We aim to determine the physical properties of the chromosphere on solar arcminute scales, by combining the high spatial resolution of ALMA with the high resolution of solar spectroscopy. We find that the temperature, density, and velocity structures are very complex and vary on scales as small as a few kilometers. We determine the relative contributions of several physical mechanisms to the formation of the chromosphere, including thermo-chemical equilibrium, radiative transfer, and hydrodynamics. We find that the non-equilibrium effects are the most important and that they can explain many of the properties of the chromosphere, such as the temperature and density structure, the presence of high-temperature regions, and the relative scarcity of HCO+ compared to HCl. We also show that the non-equilibrium effects can naturally explain the different line-of-sight integrated properties of the chromosphere as functions of optical depth throughout the solar atmosphere. Our results suggest that hydrodynamic instabilities are the dominant physical mechanism of the chromosphere, and that this is likely to be the case throughout the solar atmosphere."}
{"text":"\nWe have proposed and developed a new method to search for non-standard interactions of neutrinos using supernova neutrinos as the probe. Our method is based on the fact that the standard interaction of neutrinos with matter results in a small energy deposition, while non-standard interactions can produce much larger responses. We have constructed a search strategy that is sensitive to such large responses and is able to reject the standard model (SM) background. We have set the best current limit on non-standard interactions of neutrinos with matter and have provided the most sensitive search method for such interactions. We have also proposed a new method to search for non-standard neutrino interactions with other neutrinos which is based on the correlation of the arrival times of neutrinos at different detectors. This method can search for non-standard interactions that produce an energy deposition which is not correlated with the neutrino energy. We have found that the current limit set by this method already excludes a large class of such non-standard interactions. We have also proposed a new method to search for sterile neutrinos which is based on the correlation of the arrival times of neutrinos at different detectors. This method can search for the non-standard interaction of sterile neutrinos with other neutrinos which is not possible with the current methods. We have shown that this method can set a much stricter limit on the non-standard interaction of sterile neutrinos with active neutrinos than the current methods."}

{"text":"\nWe propose a simple and general formalism for simulation of light scattering by particles much larger than the wavelength. Our approach is based on the discrete dipole approximation, which is valid when the wavelength is much larger than the size of the scatterer. In this approximation the light scattered by a small particle is approximately described by a sum of elementary dipoles, each of which is aligned along the direction of the electric field of the incident light. We show that the strength of each dipole is proportional to the cube of the distance between the particle and the incident wave-front, and therefore the total scattered light is proportional to the product of the total number of elementary dipoles and the inverse square of the wavelength. Our approach is general and can be applied to any particle that can be described by a set of dipoles, and therefore can be used for simulation of light scattering by most macromolecules and nanoparticles. We also derive an analytical expression for the dipole approximation in the limit of large particles, and use this expression to derive a simple formula for the reduction of the scattered light as the particle size is increased. Our formula shows good agreement with numerical results for large particles, and therefore can be used for an approximate simulation and characterization of light scattering by large particles."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider the problem of the exact determination of the scalar radius of the pion and the location of the zeros in the form factor. Performing a fit to the data of the pion form factor in the energy region around the minimum of the pion Lifetime, we obtain the result that the scalar radius of the pion is equal to 0.84(3) femtometers, and the location of the first zero in the form factor is shifted to the left by 1.35(3) MeV with respect to the minimum of the pion Lifetime. We also found the relation between the scalar radius of the pion and the two zeros in the form factor. Our result for the scalar radius is consistent with the previous result of Ref.

{"text":"\n\nWe introduce a notion of a quantum group of isometries in classical and noncommutative geometry. The notion of a quantum group of isometries is motivated by the desire to generalize the classical theory of isometry groups to geometric settings that are not locally Euclidean. In particular, we consider the following two settings. First, we consider the setting of finite dimensional Euclidean spaces equipped with a symmetric, nondegenerate, quadratic form, and we show that the group of invertible linear operators on such a space which preserve the quadratic form (up to a constant multiple) form a quantum group of isometries. Second, we consider the setting of a locally compact group G with a homotopy equivalent Lie group structure, and we show that the group of isometries of the classifying space for G which preserve the inner product (up to a constant multiple) form a quantum group of isometries. As an application, we show that the quantum group of isometries of the Grassmannian in the setting of noncommutative geometry is isomorphic to the standard group of isometries of the Grassmannian in the classical setting."}
{"text":"\nWe introduce a new class of lattice Boltzmann methods for the simulation of nonequilibrium processes in complex fluids. Our focus is on the limiting behavior of such algorithms as the Knudsen number goes to zero, in the limit of large lattice sizes and in the presence of a small number of species. The main tool we use is a new stability criterion for the solutions of the lattice Boltzmann equations. This approach allows us to design lattice Boltzmann methods that are guaranteed to converge to the nonequilibrium steady state for any initial condition. In particular, we show that by combining an annealing schedule with a small number of additional operations per lattice site, one can achieve a nearly exact convergence to the entropy limit. This is in contrast to the common belief that such a guarantee can only be obtained by an extensive modification of the lattice Boltzmann equation. As an application, we study the early time behavior of the new methods. In particular, we show that the new methods are able to reach the stationary state much faster than the commonly used lattice Boltzmann methods."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a kinetic and fluid model of cascades in weakly collisional magnetized plasmas, based on the gyrokinetics formalism. The model includes both kinetic and fluid turbulent cascades, driven by the magnetic field, in a self-consistent way. We show that the kinetic and fluid turbulent cascades are closely related, in a manner which depends on the strength of the magnetic field. In particular, we find a transition between kinetic and fluid turbulent cascades, in the limit of a strong magnetic field. In this limit, the kinetic and fluid cascades become a single entity, which is characterized by a kinetic energy spectrum which depends on the energy diffusion rate. The energy diffusion rate in turn depends on the mean free path of the particles, which in the limit of a strong field becomes equal to the inverse of the frequency of the kinetic and fluid turbulent cascades. We explain this in terms of a generalized Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model, which includes a stochastic element. We also derive a simple expression for the kinetic energy spectrum, in terms of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics. We discuss the relevance of our results to a variety of astrophysical weakly collisional magnetized plasmas, including the solar wind, the magnetosphere, and accretion discs."}

{"text":"\n\nIntelligent location of simultaneously active acoustic emission sources: Part I. motivation and methodology\n \nA large number of acoustic emission (AE) sources, e.g., multiple cracks in a structural component, can simultaneously produce emissions, which makes the location of these sources a challenging task. This paper presents a methodology for locating simultaneously active AE sources on the basis of the distribution of theirAEintensity values. In contrast to existing methods, this approach does not require AE sources to be active at different times and, thus, it is suitable for locating sources that are simultaneously active. The proposed methodology is based on the fact that the distribution of the intensity values of simultaneously active AE sources has special characteristics that can be utilized in the location process. In this paper, this methodology is first theoretically validated and then tested using real AE data. The results show that this methodology can accurately locate simultaneously active AE sources."}

We further study the properties of the corresponding adjoint metric and show that it satisfies the Bonnet-Myers-Steele equations.

{"text":"\n\nPotassium intercalation in graphite: A van der Waals density-functional study\n\nWe present a van der Waals density-functional study of potassium intercalation in graphite. We consider both the infinite-layer graphite and the single-layer graphene limits. We find that the interaction between potassium and the carbon layers is much stronger in the presence of a large graphitic cation, such as potassium, than for smaller cations, such as lithium. In the case of infinite-layer graphite, we evaluate the potassium intercalation energy and the amount of potassium intercalated at a given value of the interaction energy. Our results show that, in contrast to the case of lithium intercalation, the intercalation of potassium in graphite is a strongly endothermic process that is energetically unfavorable for any significant amount of intercalation. In the case of single-layer graphene, we evaluate the transmission coefficient of potassium as a function of the van der Waals interaction energy. Our results show that, in contrast to the case of lithium, the transmission of potassium through a single layer of graphene is a strongly endothermic process that is energetically unfavorable for any significant transmission. We also present a study of the electronic and structural properties of potassium-intercalated graphite and graphene, and we discuss the implications of our results for the mechanism of potassium intercalation in graphite."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present photometric detections of the K-band companions of three single-lined eclipsing binaries (HAT-TR-205-013, HAT-TS-52, and HAT-TS-53) using the Hubble Space Telescope. These companions are previously undetected low-mass stars in very wide orbits. We determine the masses of the companions by measuring their radii using the thermal-radiometric method and find that two of the three companions are compact M-dwarfs and the third is a small red giant. These detections bring the total number of known M-dwarfs in wide orbits around low-mass stars to nine, indicating that at least 10% of low-mass stars host an M-dwarf in a wide orbit. We present a simple model based on the known wide M-dwarfs that predicts the orbital distribution of M-dwarfs in wide orbits. Our model predicts that there are roughly 200,000 wide M-dwarfs in our galaxy, a large fraction of which are hiding in the glare of their brighter host stars. We discuss the implications of this prediction in the context of detecting and characterizing low-mass planets, brown dwarfs, and other hidden populations in our solar system and the Galaxy."}

We show that the superfield formulation of (non-)Abelian 1-form theories is always of the form of a nilpotent symmetrized superfield theory, and we provide a rigorous derivation of this result in the case of arbitrary dimension. In particular, we show that the underlying (non-)Abelian 1-form theory is always expressible as a nilpotent superfield theory with an appropriate regularization procedure.

{"text":"\n\nWe continue the study of Lagrangian quantum field theory in the momentum picture started in two previous papers. We derive commutation relations for free fields, in a way which is consistent with the principles of the theory, and does not require an amendment of the formalism in order to take into account the non-conservation of the momentum. The general structure of the commutation relations is similar to the one obtained in the ordinary approach to quantum field theory, but the role of the momenta is different. We show that a general conservation law for the momenta can be derived from the Lagrangian formalism, and that this law is satisfied in a large class of simple models. (The conservation of the momenta is a general feature of the dynamics of the theory, which is related to the structure of the Lagrangian, and is not restricted to free fields.) We also show that the Hamiltonian formalism can be derived from the Lagrangian formalism by a simple transformation, which does not change the dynamics of the theory. The approach to quantum field theory developed in this paper is different from the ordinary approach, but it has certain similarities to the approach developed by Kajita, and to various forms of the Copenhagen interpretation. We believe that this approach provides a more natural and satisfying way of thinking about the structure of quantum field theory, and that it has interesting and important implications for the interpretation of the theory."}

We show that this model is in good agreement with recent experiments on the epitaxial assembly of spherical quantum dots on a square lattice, and we use it to analyze the role of the energy of the interaction and of the strain in the assembly process. We find that the energy of the interaction has a significant effect on the structure of the final assembly, while the strain has a more limited role, in agreement with recent experiments.

{"text":"\nWe present a detailed numerical study of the impact of stellar-dynamical evaporation on the evolution of the mass function of globular clusters. We find that the most significant effects are on the high-mass end of the mass function, where the power law index is reduced by up to two orders of magnitude. We show that this is due to the fact that massive globular clusters are more susceptible to the erosion of massive attractions, while the effect of the increase of small attractions is negligible. Our results are consistent with observations, in that the most massive clusters are found to be the most metal-poor. We find that the assumption of a constant initial mass function is not justified. The mass function is shown to be self-reproducing only for clusters with initial mass functions with power law indices between -1 and -2. We show that a correct reproduction of the mass function requires an initial mass function that has a power law index between -2 and -3, and that is biased toward low masses. This finding has important implications for the study of the formation history of globular clusters, as it indicates that massive clusters must have formed through the accretion of several small clusters. We find that the mass function of a globular cluster can be very well reproduced by the dynamical evolution of an initial mass function that has a power law index between -2 and -3, provided that the cluster is allowed to experience significant stellar-dynamical evaporation. This conclusion can be guaranteed only if the initial mass function is biased toward low masses. We discuss our results in the framework of the controversy about the origin of the mass function, and we suggest that our findings are consistent with the idea that the mass function is formed through the accretion of several small clusters."}

{"text":"\nWe live in a world of entities: we are surrounded by things, by beings, by stuff. But why is there something rather than nothing?

{"text":"\nWe study ideal hydrodynamics of freely cooling inelastic gases containing heavy monatomic gases (named `B' gases) in the presence of a uniform magnetic field. The heavy atoms interact with the external field via their atomic spins. The system evolution is driven by the thermal expansion and the disorder induced by the statistical thermodynamic fluctuations. The gas density and the spin correlation function simultaneously satisfy theNash\u2013M\u00f6ller equation. Therefore the system is classified as a superconductor with a nonzero resistivity. The temperature dependence of the system thermodynamics is derived from the statistical theory of gases and the Boltzmann equation. We find a clear signature of the resistive nature of the superconducting phase: the formation of a singularity in the gas density as function of the temperature. The mass and the energy of the gas are conserved only in the thermodynamic limit. The relaxation time of the system is exponentially small compared to the inverse of the resistivity. Therefore the singularity formation process is extremely fast. In this sense the system is stable against any perturbations which would try to avoid the singularity formation. We show that the singularity formation is very robust against changes in the gas mixture. In fact we found a whole family of exact solutions of the corresponding set of ODEs. Our results are consistent with the earlier result of Glauber and Lamoreaux, who considered a gas of light monatomic gases in the presence of a magnetic field and found the same singularity. We also found a good agreement with the result of Heyl and Eile, who studied the thermodynamics of a monatomic gas in a uniform electric field and also found the singularity formation. Our work generalizes these two results."}
{"text":"\n\nWe study a model of quasistatic dislocation motion in crystalline materials with two competing potentials, one attractive and one repulsive. The competition between the two potentials gives rise to a complex energy landscape with several local energy minima. We show analytically and numerically that dislocations can undergo large-scale excursions, resulting in waves of rapid dislocation motion, even in the absence of any external driving forces. We derive a simple expression for the speed of these waves as a function of the ratio of the two potentials and the applied stress. We show that this expression is nearly universal for a large class of dislocations, regardless of the underlying crystal structure or the specific details of the two potentials. We also show that the spectrum of waves is very broad, with waves of all speeds between zero and a finite upper limit, and that the fraction of waves with a given speed is inversely proportional to that speed. We discuss the physical implications of these results and the broader implications for the theory of dislocations and crystalline materials."}
{"text":"\nWe report on some new experimental photonic flame effect features. A motivation for the research is the problem of developing new types of optical flames, which can be used for practical applications, for example, in the field of security, for the authentication of documents and products, in the field of design and for the production of innovative optical materials. Our key idea is based on the use of optical phase gratings with a three-dimensional (3D) relief structure, which is fabricated using a direct laser writing technique. The fabrication process is based on the use of a semiconductor laser and a spatial light modulator. We propose a new type of phase grating, which has a 3D flame-like relief structure. The proposed structure is capable of generating a photonic flame effect, which is characterized by high contrast and brightness, as well as a high degree of spatial and spectral confinement of the radiation. The obtained results are explained by the concept of coupled Fabry-Perot microcavities in the 3D flame-like structure. We also show that the intensity distribution in the photonic flame can be modified by changing the fabrication parameters and the structure of the phase grating."}
{"text":"\nWe introduce a general approach to statistical modeling of physical laws based on nonparametric regression. The approach is motivated by the fact that the process of scientific discovery often involves identifying a relationship between physical quantities and then quantitatively characterizing the relationship. We focus on regression-based methods because they are well-suited for exploring nonlinear relationships and because they are used extensively in statistics to model data. Our approach is general and can be applied to any system in which the quantities of interest can be measured experimentally. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to three problems in physics: (1) we show how to use regression to learn the functional form of an unknown physical law from data, (2) we show how to use regression to fit a physical law to data in a way that reduces the impact of noise on the resulting fit, and (3) we show how to use regression to identify a physical law that describes a data set, even when the form of the physical law is not known in advance."}
{"text":"\nWe present an analysis of the dynamics of the accretion disc around the black hole in the LMXB source 1E0658-56. We find that the disc is likely to have been formed by the accretion of the hydrogen gas from a large rotating infalling object, such as a giant planet, that strayed too close to the black hole. The dynamics of the system is consistent with a gravitational slingshot of the bullet cluster, only barely enough time and gravity to accelerate the bullet. The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations of the black hole in 1E0658-56, in combination with the 2015 theory by1966(); 1997(); 2002() that the largest objects in galactic nuclei are the remnants of giant planets that formed around the early galactic nuclei and were later ripped off by the central black holes, suggest that the process of planet formation in the galactic nuclei is a violent one. We propose that the accretion discs around black holes in galactic nuclei are formed by the same process as the discs around young stars, by the accretion of gas from the infalling object."}

As an application, we show that the new loss inequality can be used to prove a variation of the portmanteau theorem in measure theory."}
{"text":"\nMultiple Parton Scattering in Nuclei: Quark-quark Scattering\nWe study the multiple parton scattering (MPS) in nuclei within the framework of the quark-quark scattering (Q2SCAT) model. The Q2SCAT model has been developed to study the hardest quantum chromodynamics (QCD) processes in nuclei and it is based on the combination of the quark-meson coupling constant (CM) and the quark- antiquark coupling constant (CA). In this work we investigate the effects of the relevant structure functions (SFs) of the fundamental building blocks of nuclei, the nucleons, on the description of the MPS in nuclei. For this purpose, we consider the simple case of a nucleus composed of two identical nucleons, i.e. the deuteron, and study the effects of the two relevant SFs of the nucleons, namely the total cross section (CT) and the coherent cross section (CC), on the description of the MPS in the deuteron. In particular, we find that the inclusion of the CT and CC in the Q2SCAT model significantly improves the description of the MPS in the deuteron, since it allows to properly describe the underlying quark-quark degrees of freedom and their associated complex dynamics."}
{"text":"\nWe report a simple and fast method for the production of high-quality aligned single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) films. The method is based on the Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) assembly of SWCNTs from bulk materials. We show that the use of an appropriate non-ionic surfactant enables the formation of dense aligned SWCNT films with high packing efficiency and high electrical conductivity. The method is scalable, enabling the production of films up to several cm2 in area. The electrical conductivity of the films was found to increase with the number of layers, reaching a value of 3.5 kS cm-1 for a film with 8 layers. We also found that the films were highly transparent to visible light and exhibited a high anisotropic thermal conductivity, reaching values as high as 2000 W m-1 K-1 in the direction parallel to the SWCNTs and 70 W m-1 K-1 perpendicular to the SWCNTs. The large difference in the thermal conductivity in the two directions is explained by the highly aligned nature of the SWCNTs in the direction parallel to the compression axis. The method is attractive for the development of thermal interface materials, transparent conductive films, and anisotropic thermal conductors."}
{"text":"\nWe consider a nonlinear dynamics of the phonon stimulated emission in a microwave solid-state resonator of the nonautonomous phaser generator. A model of the self-sustained phonon oscillator in the thermodynamic limit is derived. It is shown that the interband electron transport can excited the collective phonon oscillation. A theory of the limit cycle of the phonon oscillator is developed. The influence of the electron-phonon coupling on the nonlinear dynamics of the light emission is analyzed. A special type of the limit cycle, which describes the strong coupling of the electron and phonon degrees of freedom, is considered. The dynamics of the electron-phonon system in the resonator with a periodic boundary condition is investigated. The possible implementations of the phonon oscillator are proposed. The regime of the optimal operation of the phonon generator is found. The influence of the initial conditions and the thermal noise on the dynamics of the phonon stimulated emission is studied."}
{"text":"\nWe report a detailed study of the magnetic properties of Fe nanodots with diameters below 100 nm. We have prepared and characterized a large number of samples with different dot diameters, different number of dots, different spacer materials, different host materials, and different magnetic fields applied during the synthesis process. Our study reveals that the magnetic properties of these nanodots are extremely sensitive to their size, structure, and history. By using a combination of magnetic characterization techniques, we were able to uncover the different magnetic states that these nanodots can adopt and to study their magnetic stability. In particular, we found that these nanodots can have different magnetic states in the absence of an external magnetic field, and that their magnetic state is very sensitive to the number of dots in the system, the spacer material, and the host material. We also found that these nanodots can be magnetically saturated in an external magnetic field, but that the strength of the external field required for this purpose is extremely sensitive to the magnetic state of the nanodots. Our results reveal the complex nature of the magnetic properties of these nanodots and suggest that, even when they are used for the same purpose, a thorough characterization of the magnetic properties of these nanodots is crucial."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present an online repository of Swift\/XRT light curves of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), which enables the identification and characterization of the optical\/NIR counterparts of GRBs. We also present a basic analysis of the repository, in the form of an interactive web application. The online repository will be updated as additional GRBs are observed by Swift\/XRT, and we expect it to become an important tool in the analysis of the optical\/NIR counterparts of GRBs.\n\nWe motivate our work by discussing the important role that optical\/NIR observations of GRBs have played in our understanding of the burst mechanisms and the associated electromagnetic emission, and by outlining the current challenges in the field. We then present our approach to building the repository, and the results of our work. In particular, we show that about one-third of the Swift\/XRT light curves of the brightest GRBs contain significant (visually obvious) transient features in the optical\/NIR range. The remaining two-thirds either do not show any transient features, or the transient features are weak and\/or not visually obvious. We also show that a basic analysis of the transient features (e.g., the burst rise\/tail times, the burst height, and the length and shape of the peak) can be used to differentiate between different burst mechanisms.\n\nWe discuss the implications of our findings for future work in this area. In particular, we discuss the possibility of using machine learning techniques to automate the analysis of the Swift\/XRT light curves of GRBs, and of using the results of this analysis to identify the burst mechanisms and the associated electromagnetic emission. We also discuss the need for additional observations of GRBs in the optical\/NIR range, in order to better constrain the burst mechanisms and the associated electromagnetic emission."}
{"text":"\nWe consider nearly horizon-skimming orbits in Kerr spacetimes, both circular and non-circular. The circular orbits can be understood using the standard techniques of Kerr spacetime. The non-circular orbits require an analysis that takes into account the variation of the specific orbital energy as a function of the eccentricity. For a given $M>0$, we can find a unique non-circular orbit that has the same $L_M$ as a circular orbit with $e=\\sqrt{M\/m}$, where $m$ is the mass of the object. The eccentricity of this orbit is given by $e=\\sqrt{2M\/m}$. For a fixed $M$, this orbit has a one-to-one correspondence with the circular orbit with $e=\\sqrt{M\/m}$. This can be understood by noting that the specific orbital energy is the only coordinate that is not affected by a coordinate transform that swaps the two hemispheres. We show that this orbit is stable with respect to small perturbations. The energy limit of this orbit is $L_0$, which is the minimum orbital energy of an object with mass $m$ that can have a nearly horizon-skimming orbit. For an orbit with $e<\\sqrt{2M\/m}$ the energy limit is less than $L_0$. In this case, the orbit is unstable with respect to small perturbations. The semi-major axis of the orbit is proportional to $e$. Thus the orbit is also radially increasing. We also show that the circular and non-circular nearly horizon-skimming orbits are equally stable with respect to the violations of the Strong Equivalence Principle (SEP) due to the bulk effect."}
{"text":"\nWe study vortices in a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of atomic gases, a system in which vortices can be created, modified or destroyed by a weak probe field. We develop a theory which treats vortices as topological defects and examines the dynamics of vortex creation, evolution and annihilation in a BEC. We calculate the structure of vortex core and vortex formation probability as a function of temperature, and show that the latter has a sharp transition as a function of temperature, which can be used to identify the BEC transition temperature. We find that the total number of vortices in the BEC has a simple expression, which is consistent with the experiment observation in a one dimensional BEC. Our theory also explains quantitatively several other phenomena in vortex dynamics, such as the increase of vortex core size as the temperature decreases. Our results indicate that the behavior of vortices in a BEC is very different from that in a normal gas, and a theory which treats vortices as topological defects can provide a unified and consistent explanation of a variety of phenomena in vortex dynamics."}
{"text":"\n\nWe reexamine the problem of spin decoherence in semiconductor quantum dots from the equation-of-motion approach. We show that the standard argument, which relies on the assumption that the \"effective\" magnetic field is always aligned with the spin direction, is not correct. We then present a general equation of motion for a symmetric quantum dot with an arbitrary symmetry of the Hamiltonian. Within this framework, we evaluate the spin dephasing time in a symmetric quantum dot with an asymmetric boundary field. We find that dephasing times can be significantly longer than those expected from the standard argument, and we explain the physical origin of the difference. We also show that the dephasing time has a maximum as a function of the dot size and the boundary field strength, and we explain the physical origin of this maximum. Our results suggest that in certain ranges of the parameters the dephasing time can be made arbitrarily long by using a symmetric quantum dot with an asymmetric boundary field."}
{"text":"\nWe study a chain of magnetic dipoles embedded in a Heisenberg antiferromagnetic matrix. We determine the structure of the spin-spin correlation functions in the thermodynamic limit as the number of dipoles tends to infinity. The use of the Green-Kubo relations allows us to evaluate the magnitude of the thermodynamic spin-spin correlation functions and their respective temperatures in the limit of a large number of dipoles. The results show a strong interplay between the two types of correlations, with the appearance of new correlation functions as the system is driven away from equilibrium by a thermal spin-current. We also determine the non-equilibrium spin-spin correlation functions for a finite number of dipoles. The results show that the thermodynamic and the non-equilibrium correlation functions are related by a factor that depends on the thermal conductivity and the non-equilibrium spin-current. This factor can be controlled by a field applied along the direction of the chain. Our results are consistent with a picture where the thermodynamic correlations are due to a balance between the spin-current and the thermal fluctuations, while the non-equilibrium correlations are due to the action of the spin-current on the thermal fluctuations."}
{"text":"\n\nTitle: Extraction of physical laws from joint experimental data\nAbstract:\nWe consider the problem of extracting physical laws from joint experimental data, i.e., data containing signals from multiple physical phenomena. We focus on the case where the signals from different physical phenomena are decorrelated, and propose a general framework for extracting the physical laws from the joint data by combining information theory with statistical learning theory. Our approach is to represent the joint data using a latent variable model, and then use the information theory to guide the statistical learning of the physical laws from the latent variables. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on simulated data, and also apply it to a real-world experiment where we jointly extract power laws and an exponential decay law from galaxy redshift data. Our approach has the advantage of being general, in the sense that it can be used to extract any physical laws from any kinds of data as long as the data can be represented using a latent variable model."}
{"text":"\n\nA computer program for fast non-LTE analysis of interstellar line spectra\n\nWe present a computer program for fast analysis of line spectra in order to derive physical properties of the observed interstellar medium. The program is based on a non-LTE model of the hydrogen molecular and hydrogen line spectra. The model includes a treatment of the non-regularity of the Stark broadening and of the fine structure splitting. We have tested the program on a large set of lines observed toward a number of molecular clouds and in a few cases also toward H II regions. We found that the program is reliable and accurate in the analysis of lines with width up to about 1000 km\/s. We also show that the analysis of lines with larger width, although possible, may be subject to uncertainties due to the underlying assumptions. In all cases the derived relative molecular hydrogen density is in good agreement with the values obtained from other independent observations. We discuss the accuracy of the analysis and the reliability of the derived physical parameters. We also compare our non-LTE results with recent literature results based on a LTE analysis of the same lines."}
{"text":"\n\nMotivation\nWe present a new methodology for the estimation of the number of hidden factors in experimental data, based on the principles of information theory. Our approach is different from previous methods in three important aspects: (i) it is applicable to datasets of arbitrary size, (ii) it is not dependent on any specific model, and (iii) it provides a natural way to assess the amount of information in the data and to detect and quantify experimental noise.\nApplication to a genetic dataset\nWe demonstrate the efficacy of our new methodology by applying it to a real dataset of gene expression measurements in which we seek to uncover the true number of hidden factors that explain the observed variation in the data. Our analysis shows that the true number of factors is likely to be much smaller than the number of variables in the data, suggesting that a large proportion of the variation may be due to experimental noise. We show how our method can be used to detect and quantify this noise, and to identify the most informative features in the data.\nConclusion\nOur new methodology for the estimation of experimental data redundancy is broadly applicable to any type of data and any size dataset, and provides a natural way to assess the amount of information in the data and to detect and quantify experimental noise.

If the manifold is additionally equipped with a metric with negative Curvature, we show that the smooth pieces of the decomposition are parabolic submanifolds, and that the corner pieces are locally at most 3-codimensional. As an application, we give a description of the subspace of steady velocity fields of a certain class of self- degenerating manifolds in terms of a minimal model program."}
{"text":"\n\nWe show that the weak flavor violating parameter $\\alpha$ can be extracted from the B meson final state produced in $B\\to\\pi\\pi$ collisions, in a way which is largely insensitive to the underlying theory. The extraction is based on the observation that the final state is largely invariant under reparametrization of the longitudinal momenta of the two mesons. We show that this is equivalent to the requirement that the matrix element of a fermionic operator constructed from the longitudinal momenta is conserved. We pay particular attention to the case where the reparametrization invariance is not respected, which we dub the ``controversial'' extraction of $\\alpha$ from $B\\to\\pi\\pi$. We show that such an extraction is equivalent to the assumption that the longitudinal momenta are predetermined, and that this assumption can be made without loss of generality. We show that the reparametrization invariance of the $B\\to\\pi\\pi$ final state is a strong constraint on the dynamics of the system, and can be used to derive a new relation between the $B$ and $D$ meson final states. This relation could be useful in searching for new physics in $B\\to\\pi\\pi$ collisions."}
{"text":"\n\nA large number of photochromic diarylethene derivatives with various substituents have been synthesized and investigated both experimentally and theoretically in the past decades. These molecules have been found to be useful in a wide range of applications, such as optical memories, optical sensors, and photonic integrated circuits. One of the most important issues regarding the applications of diarylethene derivatives is the switching mechanism, which is strongly related to the structural characteristics of the molecule. To the best of our knowledge, the switching mechanisms of diarylethene derivatives have not been systematically studied and are far from fully understood. In this work, a series of diarylethene derivatives were designed, synthesized, and studied in order to investigate the structure-property relationship of the switching mechanism. The results showed that the switching mechanism can be altered by introducing different substituents to the diarylethene core, and the photostationary state can be stabilized by utilizing fluorine and chlorine atoms. The practical applications of the designed molecules were also discussed."}
{"text":"\nWe report the results of a first-principles-based tight-binding molecular dynamics (TB-MD) simulation study of the temperature dependence of the tensile properties of single-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs). We find that the breaking strain of CNTs increases significantly with temperature, but the breaking strength decreases, which implies that the extension of CNTs becomes easier but their pulling apart becomes harder. We also found that the temperature-induced increase in the breaking strain is much more pronounced for CNTs with larger radii. In addition, our TB-MD simulation results suggest that the extension of CNTs becomes easier (the breaking strain increases) when they are pulled in the direction perpendicular to the hexagon network, while it becomes harder (the breaking strain decreases) when they are pulled along the direction parallel to the hexagon network. Our results provide useful physical insights into the temperature dependence of the tensile properties of CNTs and can be used to optimize the design of CNT-based nanocomposites and nanoelectromechanical systems."}
{"text":"\nWe present a study of the transverse proximity effect in the spectral hardness of the line of sight towards HE 2347-4342. We have observed a significant hardening of the spectral energy distribution of the line of sight towards a group of galaxies, which has a strong overlap with the energy distribution of a closer group. This is in strong contrast to the prediction of theEllis-reon brook-neland (ERBN) model, according to which the spectral hardness should be suppressed in the line of sight towards the overlapping source. The presented observations are consistent with a simple model, in which the spectral energy distribution is taken to be proportional to the line-of-sight (LOS) absorption. In this model, the LOS absorption towards the more distant group is larger and the energy distribution is therefore harder than towards the nearby group. We discuss this model in the framework of the ERBN model and suggest that the LOS absorption is the relevant quantity for a correct prediction of the transverse proximity effect in spectral hardness."}

{"text":"\nWe investigated the reliability on the direction of the incident neutrino for the fully contained events and partially contained events due to QEL in the Super-Kamiokande. We found that the reliability of the direction is higher for the fully contained events.

On the other hand, the partially contained events have the small signal and the direction is not reconstructed accurately. We also found that the fully contained events have the higher reliability on the direction than the partially contained events. We tried to find the origin of the QEL and found that the signals from the top and the bottom of the detector are large and have the high reliability. On the other hand, the signals from the side of the detector are small and have the low reliability. This is because the QEL from the side of the detector is not fully contained and the direction is not reconstructed accurately."}
{"text":"\nIntricate Knots in Proteins: Function and Evolution\nThe function of a protein is encoded in its amino acid sequence and is determined by the intrinsic properties of its constituent amino acids as well as by the amino acid sequence itself. The knowledge of the function of a protein is essential for understanding its role in the cell and its contribution to the onset and progression of disease. A large number of proteins are involved in the execution of a particular function and work in a concerted manner to achieve a specific goal, such as the assembly of an organelle, the duplication of a cell, or the propagation of a signal. Elucidating the principles by which proteins execute their function is essential not only for understanding the physiology of the cell, but also for the rational design of pharmaceutical agents that can modulate protein function for therapeutic purposes. We have developed a computational method that uses only the amino acid sequence of a protein to extract the principles by which it executes its function. We show that the protein function is encoded in the functional organization of its constituent amino acids, which we term the protein's \"intricate knots.\" We have identified the intricate knots in a large number of proteins from various organisms, and we show that these knots are evolutionarily conserved. Our results suggest that the intricate knots are \"carrying the function\" of the protein and have important implications for protein function, evolution, and design."}
{"text":"\n\nWe investigate a system of two qubits in a fluctuating environment, as a model of decoherence and relaxation processes generated by thermal and other fluctuations in the environment. The model is approached from the framework of quantum mechanics, and the influence of the environment is accounted for by a Lindblad-like operator. The equations of motion of the qubits are solved analytically, and the exact form of the solution, including the effect of the environment, is derived. The special case of pure dephasing is discussed in some detail, and the results are compared with the predictions of the standard Boltzmann-like equation for relaxation in a fluctuating environment. Our results show that in certain parameter ranges the dynamics of the qubits can be effectively described by the standard Boltzmann equation, with a single relaxation rate. In other ranges, however, the relaxation dynamics is more complex, and can be well described by a combination of two or more relaxation rates, depending on the relation between the relevant time-scales of the qubit and the environment. We also discuss the implications of our results for a realistic model of decoherence and relaxation."}
{"text":"\n\nWe introduce and analyze a new measure of random Boolean networks, the average sensitivity, which counts the number of nodes whose status can be determined (or detected) from the status of a single node. We show that the average sensitivity is a good measure of the complexity of the network. We also show that random Boolean networks with a small average sensitivity have a large number of non-trivial cliques, while the opposite is true for large average sensitivity networks. We analyze the average sensitivity of random Boolean networks with a given number of nodes and connections, and show that the probability distribution of the average sensitivity has several interesting properties. In particular, the distribution is shown to have a power law tail, which suggests that large random Boolean networks are scale-free. We show that this power law tail can be obtained by a simple model of random Boolean networks with a small number of connections per node, and that this model can be used to estimate the average sensitivity of large random Boolean networks."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider the problem of computing the number of compositions of n elements of a finite Coxeter group that do not cross a specified permutation. We show that the number of such compositions can be computed in polynomial time in n, if the Coxeter group has a particular commutator property. We give an easy criterion for a Coxeter group to have this property, and show that all the symmetric groups and the Alternating group have this property. We then consider the more general problem of computing the number of compositions of n elements of any finite Coxeter group that do not cross a general permutation. We show that if the Coxeter group has the same commutator property as the symmetric and Alternating groups, then the number of such compositions can be computed in polynomial time in n; if the Coxeter group does not have this property, then the number of such compositions can be computed in 2^n time. We consider the case of the generalised non-crossing partitions, and show that the number of such partitions can be computed in 2^n-1 time."}
{"text":"\n\nA Spitzer census of the IC 348 nebula\n\nWe present the results of a Spitzer Space Telescope survey of the ionized gas in the young planetary nebula IC 348. We have obtained Spitzer observations in two infrared bands, and from these we derive the relative number density and the temperature distribution of the ionized gas. The goal of our research is a better understanding of the physical structure and evolution of the nebula. We find that the ionized gas is confined to a small volume, with a total number density of log(4.2 cm-3) = 1.4 relative to the ISM, and that it is surprisingly hot, with temperatures in the range 10-30 K. We show that this hot ionized gas has a Gaussian velocity distribution with a standard deviation of 3.2 km s-1. We also derive a total ion mass of 2.4 x 10-3 M-0, which is small compared to the mass of the object that is likely to have formed the nebula (3.3 M-0). This implies that the ionized gas is likely to have been heated by the passage of the ionizing star, rather than by any ongoing accretion process. The high temperature of the gas implies a powerful electron energy distribution function, and this is confirmed by a relatively high ionization fraction (4-5%). We discuss various models that could explain the ionization mechanism and the origin of the gas, and we find that the most likely model is one in which the gas was part of a circumbinational disk around the pre-planetary core, and was ionized by a single episode of star passage."}

We find that the SN 1987A is still accreting matter, although at a rate that is most likely to be less than 1 M\u22c5 yr\u22121. We estimate the energy released in the first seven years of the supernova to be about 2.4 \u00d7 1051 erg, which corresponds to an excess energy with respect to the Chandrasekhar limit of about 3.4%. We find that the energy release rate has decreased significantly since the supernova burst, and is now only about 7% of the burst rate. We also find that the gas in the SN 1987A is still at high temperature, and that the temperature does not decrease as quickly as the accretion rate. This may be explained by the fact that the gas is not well mixed, and so the gas that is accreting has a higher temperature than the gas that has already been accreted. We discuss this in the framework of a simple model in which the accretion of gas is due to the infall of clumps of gas. The gas that has already been accreted is likely to have a temperature that is close to the Chandrasekhar limit, and so the overall temperature of the gas in the SN 1987A is likely to decrease slowly as the accretion continues."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider the problem of Capacity of a Multiple-Antenna Fading Channel with a Quantized Precoding Matrix. In this work, we derive a closed-form expression for the capacity of a multiple-antenna fading channel with a quantized precoding matrix. The motivation for this research is to investigate the impact of quantization on the performance of a multiple-antenna system. The key idea is to use the relationship between the capacity and the distribution of the signal and the noise. The methodology is to derive the capacity by using the maximum likelihood criterion. The results show that the capacity is affected by the quantization, and the degree of the effect depends on the number of bits used to quantize the precoding matrix. The practical application of this work is in the design of multiple-antenna communication systems with quantized precoding matrices. The theoretical application of this work is in the study of the fundamental limits of communication systems with multiple-antenna channels."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a comprehensive study of the radio, X-ray, and hydrodynamic properties of the intriguing wind nebula G328.4+0.2, which is potentially the result of the most recent (as yet unidentified) supernova (SN) in the Galactic neighborhood. The complex multiwavelength data set we have obtained includes radio continuum, X-ray, and hydrodynamic data, as well as data from thecatalog of radio sources 3CRST, the Tully-Horan database, and the UV source database. We find that the radio source in the center of G328.4+0.2 is a point source with the hydrogen line at the correct position. The radio source has a non-detached single-zone spectrum with a turnover frequency of 1.4 GHz, a possible rotation frequency, and a total flux density of 1.5 Jy. We show that a simple model in which the observed phenomena are due to a single LMXB source requires an accretion rate of \u00a01.4\u00a00.3 M({O}) yr-1 and a spin-down power of \u00a00.2\u00a00.05 M({O}) yr-1. A comparison with a sample of 17 other luminous X-ray sources in molecular clouds shows that G328.4+0.2 is in a physical state distinct from that of other objects in the sample. In particular, the molecular mass of the surrounding cloud is intermediate between the low-mass clouds and the massive superclusters. The distribution of X-ray emission is intermediate between a torus and a ring, and the gas kinematics show a high velocity flow, not only in the ring, but also in the torus. We discuss the various physical scenarios that can explain this unique combination of properties and conclude that G328.4+0.2 may well be the site of the most recent SN in our Galactic neighborhood."}
{"text":"\nWe present a measurement of the three-particle correlation function in heavy ion collisions from the STAR experiment. The data sample used for this analysis contains 468 million particle pairs collected in 2005 and 2006 with the SELEX detector at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), in which the incident beam was stopped in a nuclear salt-water target. The three-particle correlation is found to be independent of the pair-cross section and the event activity, two parameters that describe the conditions of the collision. The correlation function C(r) is found to have a power law tail with a negative power of \uf062 < 1. We find that the correlation length decreases with the pair-cross section, and there is no significant difference between the correlations for events with and without associated jet production. We show that the measured correlation functions can be well described by a model in which the particles are born in a small region of space, and then their momenta are thermalized according to a Boltzmann distribution with a temperature that decreases with time."}

{"text":"\n\nTwo new basaltic asteroids in the Outer Main Belt?\n\nWe present observations of two new basaltic asteroids in the Outer Main Belt. The first, 2014 NY18, was discovered in April 2014. It is a slow rotator (8.3 h), has a well-defined light curve, and is one of only a few asteroids known to have an outer layer of regolith. We estimate the regolith layer to be 10\u201330 m thick. The second asteroid, 2017 OO1, was discovered in July 2017. It is also a slow rotator (8.1 h) and has a bright surface, suggesting a high albedo. We estimate the diameter of each asteroid to be 1.5\u20132.5 km, with a mass of 1\u20132 Mt. This makes them some of the smallest asteroids known to have a basaltic composition. We estimate the albedo of each asteroid to be in the range 0.1\u20130.3, which is unusual for a basaltic asteroid. These two asteroids provide additional evidence that the size distribution of basaltic asteroids is much broader than previously thought. We estimate the number of these asteroids to be between 10,000 and 100,000."}
{"text":"\nWe propose a new method of detecting extra-solar planets using radio astrometry. Our method combines data from existing and future radio telescopes to achieve a level of sensitivity unprecedented in extra-solar planet detection. The key idea is to use an existing high-resolution radio telescope to measure the position of a radio source relative to a reference point in the sky, and use this measurement to detect the motion of an exoplanet as it orbits its host star. The measurement is done by observing the source for several years, during which the exoplanet will move a small amount relative to the host star. We show that this method can detect an exoplanet with a mass as small as a few times the mass of the Earth, at a distance of up to several thousand light-years. We also show that the method can be used to characterize the exoplanet, by measuring its mass, radius, and orbital parameters. The main challenges for the method are: (1) detecting the very small motion of the exoplanet, (2) achieving the high angular resolution required to resolve the motion of the exoplanet, and (3) avoiding the contamination of the exoplanet signal by stellar Proper Motion. We discuss the method in detail, and evaluate the required resources. We find that the method can be implemented with existing telescopes, with a dedication of a few percent of their observing time, and without any significant modification to their hardware or software. We also find that the method will have a very high yield, since it will detect a large fraction of the exoplanets that are expected to exist in our Galaxy. We expect that this method will play a major role in the detection and characterization of extra-solar planets in the coming decades."}
{"text":"\nWe present a rigorous time-domain analysis of full--wave electromagnetic (EM) cloaking, a topic of current interest in the fields of physics and engineering. We show that the existing time-domain analysis of cloaking, based on the quick-mask method, is exact only in the limit of a small skin depth. To achieve a more general and rigorous analysis, we develop a new technique based on the dressing and diffusion equations. This technique enables one to evaluate the transmitted field in a cloaked region for a large range of frequencies and thicknesses of the cloaking materials. In particular, we show that the transmission is very sensitive to the dressing parameter, a dimensionless parameter related to the geometric and material parameters of the cloak. Our rigorous analysis predicts a number of interesting and previously unknown effects, such as a frequency-dependent transition width and a universal decrease of the transmission at low frequencies for all cloak designs. We also propose a practical method to realize a cloak in a multilayered ferroelectric substrate."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present Spitzer c2d images of the Serpens cloud complex in the Serpens\/Ophiuchus border region. This cloud complex, which consists of several distinct clouds and is the nearest large-scale molecular cloud to our solar system, has previously been observed with Spitzer in the 3.6 and 4.5 micron bands. We describe here a new observation in the 2.2 micron band. The Serpens cloud complex is approximately 250 pc away. We find that the cloud is elongated along the Serpens\/Ophiuchus border, and that it exhibits several knots, which we attribute to the locations of the dense cores. We estimate the total mass of the cloud to be 1.4 M_Sun. We find that the mid-IR colors of the Serpens cloud complex are consistent with the cloud being comprised of a mixture of dust and molecular gas, and that the cloud is slightly turbulent. The Spitzer c2d data are compared to a one-dimensional radiative transfer model in order to extract the temperature of the cloud. We find that the cloud has a range of temperatures, but that the bulk of the cloud has a temperature of 12 K."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a detailed derivation of the three-point correlation function for a point-like source and demonstrate that it can be expressed as a sum of four distinct correlation functions, one of which is the traditional two-point correlation function. The three-point correlation function has important practical applications in particle tracking experiments. We show that a well-known approximation for the three-point correlation function, the so-called \" banknotes approximation\", is exact for the special case of a source at infinity. We evaluate the three-point correlation function for an ensemble of sources in a finite volume, and for an ensemble of point-like sources distributed in a plane. The correlation function has a clear structure which is related to the distribution of the sources in space. In particular, the three-point correlation function has a \" core \" region where it is well-defined and has a simple structure, and a \" boundary region \" where it is ill-defined and becomes infinite. We show that a practical algorithm for calculating the three-point correlation function is to calculate the two-point correlation function in the core region, and to use a suitable approximation (the \" boundary approximation \" or \" contour-integration approximation \") for the boundary region. We present a number of practical examples of calculating the three-point correlation function using this algorithm."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a formation and evolution model for the Kuiper Belt based on the analysis of its current membership. We first describe a method for determining the relative ages of different Kuiper Belt objects (KBOs) based on their colors. We then utilize these ages in a model that simultaneously forms and collides KBOs to reproduce the observed distribution of colors and surface ages. The model includes an additional source of KBOs that is driven by the chaotic mixing of bodies in the Nice model. We vary the initial conditions for the formation of the Kuiper Belt and study the resulting collisional dynamics. Our results show that KBOs can evolve to their current orbits in as few as 10-50 million years. The source of the efficient collisional evolution is the outward migration of the objects that results from their forward motion and the inward migration of the objects that results from their tidal interaction with a massive terrestrial planet. We explain why the high eccentricity of the KBOs is consistent with their collisional evolution. We also show that a KBO must have had a minimum velocity of 4-6 km\/s to reach its current orbit, which eliminates a large number of candidates for the so-called \"short-period comet\" observed to have been in a retrograde orbit around the Sun. Finally, we show that the KBOs are likely to have formed in a narrow range of distances from the Sun, within 5-10 AU."}
{"text":"\nWe present numerical simulations of the merging galaxy cluster 1E 0657-5, in which the self-interaction cross-section of Dark Matter (DM) is constrained. We solve the nonlinear Boltzmann equation for the distribution of DM, using the Daley-Weinberg model for the evolution of the DM distribution during the cluster collision, while assuming a constant total DM density of $\\sim 6 \\cdot \\Omega_{\\Lambda}$. We obtain a DM distribution that is in agreement with recent observations of the cluster, and we show that the mean free path of DM particles is $\\sim R$, where $R$ is the size of the cluster. Therefore, in this simple model, the DM self-interaction cross-section is $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{self}} \\sim R^2 \\cdot \\Delta_{\\mathrm{self}}$, where $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{self}}$ is the DM self-interaction strength. For $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{self}} = 1$ we find $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{self}} \\sim (R\/10)^2$, which is much smaller than the self-interaction cross-section inferred from the motion of DM particles in a linear potential, $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{linear}} = 4 \\cdot R^2$. Hence, a simple model of the evolution of the DM distribution in a cluster collision can explain why the DM self-interaction cross-section is small. We discuss the effect of non-standard behaviours of DM particles on the self-interaction cross-section, and we conclude that such effects can produce a DM self-interaction cross-section that is consistent with the small value inferred from numerical simulations."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a data set of high-resolution (R > 2000), multiwavelength photometry of the debris disk surrounding the star PKS2155-304. The data set consists of 18 image sets, simultaneously obtained through the R and I filters of the Hubble Space Telescope and through the filters J, H, and K of the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope in 2005 January. The average radial resolution is ~120 mas, sufficient to resolve the disk's inner region. We find that the disk is rim-on viewed and that it is significantly nonaxisymmetric. There are three main intensity peaks in the disk, one of which is offset from the disk's midplane. We determine the radial and tangential motion of the disk's inner region by using the 12 sets of Hubble data, which cover a time baseline of 9.5 days. We estimate the mass of the disk's inner region to be 18 lunar masses (0.2 Earth masses) and the total disk mass to be 22,000 lunar masses (2.5 Earth masses). We discuss the disk's three-dimensional structure and the stability of its nonaxisymmetric features."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy and photometry of the black hole X-ray binary A0620-00. The motivation for our research is to better understand the accretion process in this object, which has been experiencing a large variability in its optical and NIR light during the last two years. We have performed a time series of NIR spectroscopy with the VISIR instrument at the Very Large Telescope Array, which allowed us to study the inner accretion flow in the broad-line region. We find that the accretion flow is variable on timescales of days, consistent with the observed variability in the optical and NIR light of the source. We find that the observed variability in the accretion flow is not correlated with the orbital period, but rather with the accretion phase. We find that the accretion flow is blueshifted during the early part of the accretion phase, consistent with an inward-directed accretion flow, while it is redshifted at later times, consistent with an outward-directed accretion flow. We find that the accretion flow is at its blueshifted peak when the accretion efficiency is highest, while it is at its redshifted minimum when the accretion efficiency is lowest. We also present NIR photometry of the source, which shows variability on timescales of days. We find that the variability in the photometry is not correlated with the orbital period, but rather with the accretion phase. We find that the brightness is highest when the accretion flow is blueshifted, while it is lowest when the accretion flow is redshifted. We discuss our results in the context of other black hole X-ray binaries."}
{"text":"\nWe present a model of the spectral energy distribution and variability of 3C 66A during the WEBT campaign of 2003--2004. We have developed a set of synthetic templates that are consistent with the observed brightness distribution of 3C 66A and that allow us to investigate the connection between the ionization structure and the spectral energy distribution. We find that the shape of the ionization structure has a strong effect on the shape of the spectral energy distribution and that the observed distribution can be consistently described by a model in which the ionization structure has a sharp boundary. We also find that the observed variability of the spectral energy distribution can be described by a model in which the ionization structure experiences rapid (on the timescale of hours) variations that are smoothly coupled to the bulk motion of the gas. The most plausible explanation for the observed variability is that the ionization structure is small compared to the size of the gas distribution and that the gas distribution is evolving on the scale of days. We discuss several possible physical mechanisms that may give rise to the observed spectral energy distribution and variability and that may drive the evolution of the ionization structure, including the evaporation of small-scale structures, the collision of these structures with the ambient medium, and the large-scale dynamics of the gas distribution."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present high-resolution HARPS optical spectroscopy and precise radial velocity measurements of the spotted M dwarf GJ 674. The data, obtained with the HARPS instrument on the 3.6 m ESO telescope at La Silla, consist of six observations obtained over a period of one year. We detect a long-duration, low-amplitude radial velocity variation with a period of 103.12 \u00b1 0.13 min, which we attribute to a large, undetected spotted companion in a close orbit around the primary. We estimate the mass of this companion to be 11 M\u2299, which would place it in the category of a super-Earth. The companion's orbit is well described by a circular orbit with a radius of 1.5 Rsun, where Rsun is the radius of the Sun. This would place the GJ 674 system in the so-called \"Fruc Librae region\" of the galaxy, where many spotted M dwarfs are known to have large, close-in super-Earths. The mass of the primary, M\u22c5sin i = 13.46 \u00b1 0.06 M\u2299, is consistent with that of a standard M dwarf.

{"text":"\nWe present an analysis of the 6-cm H$_{2}$CO absorption and CO(1-0) emission in the L1204\/S140 region. The main aim of our work is to investigate the possible connection between these two molecular lines. We find that the H$_{2}$CO absorption features are, in fact, due to the photodissociation of CO by the incident far-UV radiation and subsequent recombination with H$_{2}$. We show that this process produces an additional population of CO(1-0) excited state, which is not present in the case of CO photodissociation by IR radiation. The most likely sink for the excited state CO(1-0) is its collision with H$_{2}$ or another CO molecule, resulting in the deexcitation and the CO(1-0) ground state population. We discuss the possibility of using the CO(1-0)-to-CO(0-0) transition as a diagnostic tool for detecting shocked H$_{2}$. Our results are consistent with the earlier suggestion that the far-UV-induced 6-cm H$_{2}$CO absorption may be used for detecting shocked H$_{2}$. We propose that the strength of this absorption may be used as a measure of the degree of H$_{2}$ shocked state."}
{"text":"\n\nCommon Envelope Evolution Redux\n\nWe present observations of the optical and near-infrared photometry and spectroscopy of the first non- solar companions to be discovered, the original planets of the solar system: Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. Our data include new observations of the steady-state photometry of Mars in the 2-micron band, which we use to constrain the size of the Martian photosphere. We find that the photospheres of all four planets are significantly larger than the surfaces of their respective atmospheres. This is consistent with a significant fraction of the photosphere being bled off into an extended, unlit atmosphere. We have developed a model that relates the observed photosphere-to-atmosphere ratio to the escape probability of the atmosphere. In this model, the photosphere is treated as a perfect black body, while the atmosphere is treated either as a perfect absorber or a perfect emitter. We use this model to constrain the fraction of the photosphere that has been lost into the atmosphere for each planet, and we use the results to determine the scale height of the atmosphere for each planet. For the cases in which the atmosphere is treated as a perfect absorber, the scale height is found to be in the range of 4 to 7 km, while for the cases in which the atmosphere is treated as a perfect emitter, the scale height is in the range of 1 to 2 km. These results are consistent with a significant fraction of the original photospheres having been lost to the atmospheres of all four planets, and they suggest that the atmospheres of all four planets are thermally supported. We discuss the implications of our results for the evolution of the common envelopes of the planets, and for the general problem of atmosphere escape from solar system bodies."}
{"text":"\nWe present a detailed study of the electronic and optical properties of epitaxial graphene on SiC. We report that the presence of a large energy band gap in this material system is due to a quantization of the single-particle spectrum. Our results indicate that the electronic and optical properties of epitaxial graphene can be controlled by a proper choice of the SiC substrate. We also found that the band gap of epitaxial graphene can be tuned by external strain. In particular, we show that strain can be used to control the band gap in a continuous way, in contrast to the discrete tuning available by using SiC with different orbital combinations. We also found that the transport properties of epitaxial graphene are affected by the presence of a large number of charged defects. Our results are consistent with the idea that epitaxial graphene is a good candidate for device applications, provided that appropriate fabrication techniques are developed to control the number and distribution of defects."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present an analysis of the core binary fractions of star clusters from realistic simulations, in which the evolution of the cluster is followed using a Lagrangian approach. We find that the core binary fraction increases with cluster mass, and it does so in a different way for low-mass and high-mass clusters. For low-mass clusters, the core binary fraction increases monotonically with the cluster mass, while for high-mass clusters it increases superlinearly. We also find that the fraction of massive binaries (with a mass ratio larger than 3) increases with cluster mass in a way that is almost independent of the initial conditions of the cluster. These results are consistent with the massive binaries being formed through the collisional interaction of stars with an initial orbital separation of several au. We also found that the core binary fraction decreases with the cluster's stellar velocity dispersion and with the cluster's dynamical lifetime. This indicates that the core binary fraction is affected by the dynamical state of the cluster. We discuss our results in the context of the observations of massive binaries in globular clusters, and we analyze the efficiency of massive binary formation in our simulations in comparison to other works."}
{"text":"\nWe present a practical Seedless Infrared-Safe Cone jet algorithm. The algorithm securely fades a cone jet to obtain the strongest infrared-safe jet in the history of jet mathematics. The motivation for the research is to obtain a jet that is even more robustly infrared-safe than the corresponding Bird-Head Model was. The key ideas and methodology are to use the cone jet's conformal map to the line to obtain an equivalent model that can be further manipulated using only the knowledge of the jet's rotation, and then use the tools developed for the Bird-Head Model to fade the jet. The results obtained are two new types of cone jets that are guaranteed to be infrared-safe, and a practical algorithm to obtain an arbitrary strong infrared-safe jet. The problem this work attempts to solve is to obtain a strong infrared-safe jet without using the jet's symmetry. The practical application of this work is that the obtained strong infrared-safe jets can be used to study the Collatz Conjecture. The theoretical application of this work is that these jets extend the class of jets that are guaranteed to be infrared-safe."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate the influence of isospin breaking on the production of heavy meson pairs in e+e- annihilation near threshold.

{"text":"\nWe present evolutionary theory and numerical simulations investigating the remnants produced by the coalescence of a CO white dwarf with a DAO star. We find that the initial accretion phase, the subsequent coasting along the ONeMg evolutionary path, and the final deflagration are similar to the merger of a CO white dwarf with a CNO star. However, in contrast to the CNO case, the deflagration products are not massive enough to explain the observations of SN 2006jc, and we discuss possible reasons for this difference. Our main conclusion is that a CO white dwarf and a DAO star should evolve along the ONeMg path, but that a SN 2006jc-like event will only occur if the accretion phase is very efficient and the accreted material is of very low baryonic mass. We show that this can be achieved if the initial white dwarf is relatively massive and the accretion is very efficient, as might be expected in the case of a white dwarf with a relatively massive companion, such as a Thorne-Zel'dovich pair."}
{"text":"\n\nParametrized Post-Newtonian Expansion of Chern-Simons Gravity\n\nWe consider the Post-Newtonian expansion of Chern-Simons gravity, a theory recently proposed as a candidate for a generalized theory of gravity. This theory possesses an exceptional structure which allows a direct and systematic formulation of the expansion parameter. The conventional method, based on the first order in the expansion parameter, yields an accurate description of the evolution of the orbits of celestial bodies in a certain range of the gravitational parameter, but it is unable to correctly describe the motion of a body when the gravitational parameter is very small. We show that this deficiency can be remedied by a parametrized expansion which correctly describes the motion of bodies both in the macroscopic and in the microscopic regime. The resulting theory is able to correctly describe the solar system as well as the evolution of small bodies in the universe. The expansion parameter enters the theory in a very natural way and has a clear physical meaning."}
{"text":"\n\nSpline Single-Index Prediction Model: Theory and Applications\n\nThis paper presents a new prediction model, called the spline single-index prediction model, for solving nonlinear regression problems with interval-censored or interval-greedy data. The model has two stages. In the first stage, a B-spline basis function with three parameters is constructed to represent the nonlinear predictor. In the second stage, a single-index model with three parameters is used to describe the relationship between the response and the linear combination of the basis functions. The model is derived from a composite hypothesis that consists of a linear hypothesis and a nonlinear hypothesis. The proposed model is more flexible than the commonly used regression model with B-spline basis functions and is shown to have several advantages, such as accommodating of large amount of information from the data, providing a direct interpretation for the regression coefficients, having a closed-form solution for the optimal prediction, and being applicable to a wide variety of data sets. We derive the statistical properties of the model and discuss some practical considerations for parameter estimation. We also show how the model can be used for interval-censored and interval-greedy data sets. simulation studies and real data analysis are used to illustrate the proposed method."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a measurement of the aerosol phase function at the Pierre Auger Observatory. The measurement was carried out with the Mozart detector, a dedicated aerosol detector that has been operating at the Auger site since November 2018. The motivation for this work is to characterize the aerosols in the atmosphere over the Auger Observatory in order to better understand the atmosphere's contribution to the energy spectrum measured by the Auger surface detectors. The key idea is to measure the aerosol phase function using the radar technique, where a pulsed radar is used to measure the motion and velocity of aerosols in the atmosphere. The measurement was carried out in the daytime, during periods when the surface detectors are not taking data. The measurement results show that the aerosol phase function has a large positive bias, with values between 1 and 2, which indicates that the atmosphere is optically thick. This is in agreement with results from other aerosol detectors that have operated at the Auger site. The large positive bias in the aerosol phase function implies that the atmosphere is an important source of backgrounds for the Auger surface detectors, and it will be important to account for this contribution in the analysis of the Auger data. The practical application of this work is to provide a measure of the aerosol contribution to the background of the Auger surface detectors, which will be important for an optimal analysis of the Auger data. The theoretical application is to provide a measure of the aerosol phase function in the atmosphere, which is a fundamental property of the atmosphere that is important for understanding the behavior of light and radiation in the atmosphere."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present photometric observations of the young binary UZ Tau E, which reveal a periodic modulation in the accretion rhythm from its circumbinary disk. This modulation has a periodicity of ~330 days, which is approximately four times the orbital period of the binary. We show that the periodic variation in the accretion rate is accompanied by a systematic increase in the disk's photometric brightness, most likely due to an increase in the accretion rate, which reaches a maximum every 330 days. We interpret this result as a signature of a periodically varying accretion rate from the disk, most likely due to the influence of the companion star. Our findings suggest that the disk is not in radiative equilibrium, and that its internal structure is coupled to the orbital evolution of the binary. We discuss several possible physical mechanisms that could give rise to this coupling, and we highlight the importance of future observations, which will enable a more detailed study of the disk's evolution."}

{"text":"\nWe present very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations of the nineteen GHz-Peaked-Spectrum ( nineteen GPS) radio sources at 1.6 GHz. We observed twenty-one of the thirty-nine known sources in the 1.6 GHz band, and detected twelve of them. We found that the GPS sources in the 1.6 GHz band are much less bright than in the 3.5 GHz band, but their spectral indices are, in general, flatter. We determined the angular sizes of the detected sources, and found that they are generally larger than those detected in the 3.5 GHz band. We estimated the thermal centroids of the sources, and compared the directions of the optical and radio centroids. We found that the optical and radio centroids are not coincident, but are offset by 6 \u00b1 1 arcsec on average. The offset does not show any correlation with the optical or radio brightness, or with the spectral index of the radio source. We also found that the fraction of the radio source's flux contributed by the thermal emission is 5-10%. We discuss the results in the framework of a model in which the GPS sources are the relics of a thermal filament, and the non-coincidence of the centroids is explained by the fact that the optical and radio filaments are not exactly parallel."}
{"text":"\nWe present the first estimate of the local supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass function in early- and late-type galaxies, based on a sample of 2,write custom essay type=&#34;wide-plain&#34; galaxies selected from the Millennium Galaxy Catalogue. We find that the local SMBH mass function is well described by a power law with a strong cut-off at log(M\/Mpc^2) &lt; -1.7. The power law index and the magnitude of the cut-off are independent of galaxy type, morphology, size, and local group membership. Within this large sample, we find no evidence for a correlation between the local SMBH mass and galactic mass, star formation rate, or black hole accretion rate. We estimate the total number of SMBHs in our sample to be 1.9 x 10^4, with a total mass of 4.4 x 10^7 Mpc^2. The corresponding SMBH mass function is log(M\/Mpc^2) = -1.38 \u00b1 0.08, with a total uncertainty of 6.5 per cent.

{"text":"\nWe investigate the effects of the Dirac sea on pion propagation in asymmetric nuclear matter. The matter is described by the helical picture in the frame of the effective two-dimensional (2D) Dirac equation. The solution of the effective 2D Dirac equation contains two pion basis functions with different masses and different contributions to the symmetric and asymmetric sectors of the matter. The pion basis functions are shown to have the same differential properties as the ordinary Dirac fermions. Therefore, the space-time structure of the pion basis functions can be described by the properties of the ordinary Dirac fermions. As a result, the structure of the space-time in the asymmetric nuclear matter is shown to be always symmetric, independently on the asymmetricity of the matter. We also show that the structure of the symmetric sector of the pion basis functions is always the same as the structure of the ordinary Dirac fermions. Therefore, the symmetric sector of the pion basis functions can be obtained from the solution of the ordinary Dirac equation without any additional conditions. The only exception is the case when the pion basis functions have an infinite contribution to the asymmetric sector of the matter. In this case, the symmetric sector of the pion basis functions is shown to be described by the solutions of the 1D Dirac equation with the symmetric contributions of the ordinary Dirac fermions and with the anti-symmetric contribution of the ordinary Dirac fermions multiplied by the complex conjugate of the anti-symmetric basis function. We also investigate the effects of the republication of the pion basis functions on the solution of the effective 2D Dirac equation."}

Although a few magnetic metals, such as nickel and cobalt, do exist, their magnetic properties are rather poor. The ability to combine high magnetic permeability and metallic conductivity in a single material would be extremely useful for spintronic applications, such as magnetic memories, sensors, and oscillators. A natural way to combine these properties is to create a half metallicity in a ferromagnetic metal. In such a material, the magnetic properties are derived from the metal, while the non-magnetic properties are derived from the insulating shell. Ideally, such a half metallicity would have a high metallic conductivity and a high magnetic permeability, in addition to other useful properties, such as superconductivity.\n\nWe report a simple and general approach to create half metallicity in a ferromagnetic metal, using thermal treatment of a conventional metallic alloy.

{"text":"\n\nWe study the emergence of spatiotemporal chaos in a system of couplewise competitors. Our approach is based on the well-established theory of ecological slots. A system of n species is described by a set of differential equations, where the coefficients are functions of n variables, corresponding to the relative populations of the species. The coefficients are assumed to be smooth and symmetric with respect to a diagonal of the coefficient matrix. The model predicts a transition from a steady state to a state of spatiotemporal chaos, that is, a state in which the species densities show a chaotic evolution in space and time. Our theoretical analysis is based on the assumption that the species move according to a L\u00e9vy walk. We show that a generic form of the coefficient matrix, that captures the main statistical features of ecological systems, implies a transition to spatiotemporal chaos. The parameters of the model are adjusted to match the theoretical predictions with the dynamics observed in an ecological system. In particular, the parameters are chosen so that the model predicts a transition to spatiotemporal chaos, that is, a regime in which the populations of the species show a chaotic evolution in space and time."}
{"text":"\n\nWe study the pseudospectrum of the Laplace operator on the plane with a quadratic boundary condition in a very large domain, that is, for an infinite lattice of points on the plane. The motivation for this work is to understand the connection between the pseudospectrum and the spectrum of an elliptic differential operator with a quadratic boundary condition. The main tool in the theory of the pseudospectrum of an elliptic differential operator is the representation theory of the symmetric and self-adjoint parts of the Laplace operator. This approach has been used to study the pseudospectrum of the Laplace operator with a quadratic boundary condition in a finite domain. However, the situation in an infinite domain is more involved, and the theory has not been developed. In this paper, we first review the theory of the pseudospectrum of the Laplace operator in a finite domain with a quadratic boundary condition. Then we study the pseudospectrum of the Laplace operator in an infinite domain with a quadratic boundary condition."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider the problem of constructing generalized entropy measures, which are introduced in a recent paper of ours. These measures are constructed by defining the trace of the Local Operator Attribute Value Probability (LOAVP) in a basis of elementary symmetric functions of the underlying attribute values. Here we show that these measures are related to the symplectic and anti-symplectic maps of the underlying attribute space. In particular, we show that if the generalized entropy measure issymplectic, then the underlying attribute space has a Hamiltonian structure, and the generalized entropy is the momentum map of the Hamiltonian system. We also discuss the problem of finding the generalized entropy of a given object (or, equivalently, finding the object whose generalized entropy is a given value), and show that this is an NP-hard problem. We also present a methodology for finding an approximation to the generalized entropy measure of an object, by first finding the symplectic and anti-symplectic maps of the attribute space, and then projecting the desired generalized entropy measure onto the span of the basis of elementary symmetric functions used to define the generalized entropy measure."}
{"text":"\nWe consider the solution of a class of reaction-diffusion equations in which the coefficients may be singular and in which the reaction term is given by a sum of coefficients times the fractional Laplacian. The solution of these equations is given in terms of the H-function, a special function which has been extensively used in the study of partial differential equations. The motivation for this work is twofold: to extend the theory of solutions of reaction-diffusion equations to a class of nonlinear equations which includes the Coupey- Harding equation and to obtain new properties of the H-function. The main ideas and methodology used to obtain the results are as follows. We show that the solution of a class of reaction-diffusion equations which contains the Coupey-Harding equation can be obtained in terms of the H-function. We show that the H-function can be expressed in terms of a particular solution of a certain reaction-diffusion equation with singular coefficients. We then obtain the solution of the reaction-diffusion equations in terms of the H-function."}
{"text":"\n\nWe investigate the effect of a fifth large-scale space-time dimension on the conservation of energy in a four-dimensional universe. We show that the presence of a fifth dimension does not violate the energy conservation. We consider a five-dimensional space-time in which the energy is uniquely defined by the stress-energy tensor in any local rest frame and the five-dimensional space-time has a non-compact, positive curvature. In this case the energy conservation is guaranteed by the Einstein equations. We also show that if the fifth dimension is compact and negatively curved, the energy is not conserved. This is because the presence of a preferred five-dimensional rest frame in which the energy is not conserved is allowed by the Einstein equations. We analyze the effect of the non-conservation of energy on the evolution of a five-dimensional space-time and show that the space-time can be in a steady state with a well-defined energy. We also discuss the physical meaning of the non-conservation of energy in a fifth dimension."}
{"text":"\nA Multiphilic Descriptor for Chemical Reactivity and Selectivity\nThe ability to predict the products of a chemical reaction is a long-standing problem in chemistry, and is a major challenge for organic chemistry in particular. We have developed a new approach to the prediction of organic reaction products, which is based on the idea of a multiphilic descriptor. This descriptor uses a combination of various hydrophobic and hydrophilic properties to characterize the reactants, and is shown to be highly predictive for a wide range of organic reaction types. The approach is tested on a set of 76 different reaction types, and the results are compared to those obtained using other popular descriptor types. The multiphilic descriptor is shown to be the most predictive, with a prediction success rate of 80%. The method is also compared to other recent methods for reaction prediction, and is shown to be competitive with the best of these methods. The practical utility of the multiphilic descriptor is illustrated by its use in the development of a model for the prediction of product selectivity in the Apple Baylis-Hillman reaction."}
{"text":"\n\nWe have investigated the effect of MoDTC and ZDDP additives on the tribofilm formation and friction behaviour of fully dense ZrO2-based ceramics. The results show that the friction coefficient decreases with the increase of the number of sliding cycles for all the additives, but the magnitude of the friction coefficient varies with the type of additive. The friction coefficient values for MoDTC- and ZDDP-added ZrO2-based ceramics are 0.07 and 0.11, respectively, after one million sliding cycles. The images of the worn surfaces after one million sliding cycles show that the tribofilm formed with MoDTC is composed of spherical particles, while the tribofilm formed with ZDDP is a layer of amorphous material. The thicknesses of the tribofilms formed with MoDTC and ZDDP are 100 and 400 nm, respectively. The results reveal that the synergistic effects of MoDTC and ZDDP additives on the tribofilm formation and friction behaviour of ZrO2-based ceramics are mainly attributed to the formation of MoS2 and ZrS2 particles, respectively."}
{"text":"\nWe develop a lattice Boltzmann inverse kinetic approach for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. We consider a system of hydrodynamic equations for an incompressible fluid, which is driven by an external pressure gradient and where the effect of the presence of a solid body is modeled by a boundary condition at the solid-fluid interface. Our model equations include a set of inverse kinetic equations for the unresolved variables, which are derived by an algebraically rigorous transformation of the system of hydrodynamic equations. We show that the system of inverse kinetic equations can be solved analytically in a model problem, where the effect of the presence of a solid body is only local. The solution of the inverse kinetic equations forms the basis for an algorithm to solve the model equations in the presence of a general solid body. We evaluate the accuracy of the algorithm by comparing its results with those obtained by solving the system of hydrodynamic equations using a conventional lattice Boltzmann method."}
{"text":"\nWe study the phonon-mediated decay of an atom in a surface-induced potential. The goal of this work is to determine the structure and energy distribution of the states involved in this process in order to understand the mechanisms that govern it. We consider a model system consisting of a shallow donor level in a semiconductor surface, which can be occupied by an impurity atom or an exciton. The atom or exciton may decay to a lower level by means of a phonon-assisted transition, and we determine the rate of this process as a function of the energy difference between the initial and final states, the phonon energy, and the temperature. We find that the rate of decay increases with increasing temperature, which is consistent with the fact that phonon-mediated transitions are more efficient at high temperatures. We also find that the rate is highest when the initial state is a shallow donor level and the final state is a deep acceptor level, which suggests that phonon-mediated decay is more efficient when the energy difference between the initial and final states is large. Our results provide new insights into the mechanism of phonon-mediated decay of an atom in a surface-induced potential, and have important practical implications for the design of optoelectronic devices based on semiconductor surfaces."}
{"text":"\n\nDiffuse X-ray Emission from the Carina Nebula Observed with Suzaku\nWe have carried out a three-dimensional, broadband X-ray study of the Carina Nebula with Suzaku. The nebula is one of the most nearby and brightest H II regions in the sky. We observed the X-ray emission from the gas distributed in the diffuse clouds, which are normally hidden by the strong emission from the ionization front and the brilliant star cluster. Our aim was to investigate the ionization structure in the inner region of the nebula, where the stellar ionization is very strong. We found that the ionization structure is very complex, and a simple model of one-zone ionization model does not explain the observations. We proposed a model in which the ionization structure is described by two zones. The inner zone is an X-ray source and the outer zone is an absorption region. We also found that the gas in the outer zone is cooled by the strong stellar wind from the massive stars in the star cluster, and the gas temperature in the outer zone is about 2000 K, which is much lower than that in the inner zone (about 50000 K). We also found a strong correlation between the X-ray surface brightness and the gas temperature, and the correlation is well described by a power law with a negative index of -1.9. We also investigated the temperature distribution of the gas by using the correlation between the gas temperature and the X-ray surface brightness. We found a strong temperature gradient, where the temperature increases toward the ionization front. We also found that the gas in the region behind the ionization front is heated by the ionization front. We also discussed about the relation between the chemical composition and the ionization structure."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present final results of a visible spectroscopic and photometric survey of Jupiter Trojans in dynamical families. We use the ground-based data and the HST data to select the objects in a wider region of the sky to be observed by the Cassini UVIS. Our sample is composed of 52 Trojans, evenly divided between the L4 and L5 points. For the first time, the non-inertial proper motions of the Trojans in these families are determined. The distribution of the non-inertial proper motions of the members of the four families we are able to identify in our sample (Fkl, W, H, and P) is compatible with a purevsingular model with two parameters. The best-fit model with two free parameters describes the data with a reduced \u03c72 of 0.62 and gives a ratio of mean non-inertial proper motion to orbital proper motion of 0.39 \u00b1 0.18. The best-fit model can be used to derive a lower limit for the lifetime of the families of 11.9 Gyr. A large number of objects in our sample, 28, have a non-inertial proper motion larger than this limit, indicating that they must have been born elsewhere. Our results therefore confirm the picture that has emerged from the analysis of the individual objects observed with the Cassini UVIS: the Jupiter Trojans in dynamical families are not, for the most part, the debris left behind by the collisional evolution of a planetesimal belt, but rather the members of an enormous population of small solar system bodies that has migrated in from elsewhere. The four families we have identified probably represent the four largest groups of Trojans that share a common dynamical history. The other Trojans, whose numbers are increasing as our observations improve, apparently come from a wide variety of dynamical backgrounds."}
{"text":"\n FIRST-based survey of Compact Steep Spectrum sources, V.\n  Milliarcsecond-scale morphology of CSS objects\n  We present photometric observations of the compact steep spectrum (CSS) sources in the FIRST survey. We show that the milliarcsecond-scale morphology of CSS sources is different from that of broad absorption line (BAL) sources, which have a characteristic dumbbell shape. We find that the brightness distribution of a large fraction of CSS sources is well described by a power law. Based on this description we derive a simple model which relates the luminosity and the power law index to the number of components and their luminosities. We find that a large fraction (72%) of CSS sources in our survey have two components. We show that single-component sources can be explained either by the presence of a jet which is either pointed directly towards the observer (43%) or is slightly off-axis (11%), or by a highly absorbed source (36%). We also show that multi-component sources can be explained by the presence of an accretion disc around a central engine, except in cases where the disc is edge-on to the line of sight. We derive a correlation between the optical luminosity and the accretion rate for a subset of the sources with available accretion rates. We discuss the implications of our results for the structure and evolution of these sources."}
{"text":"\nWe investigated the relaxation phenomena in the high-temperature superconductor HoBa2Cu3O7-d subjected to a pulsed magnetic field. The specimens were magnetized by applying a magnetic field of several teslas for several hours and then the magnetic field was suddenly reduced to zero. We observed three different types of relaxation processes: (1) the magnetization decreases with a half-life of the order of 10-5 s, (2) the magnetization decreases with a half-life of the order of 100 s, and (3) the magnetization remains constant. The processes (1) and (2) are well described by a model based on the thermally activated destruction of the magnetic order. The process (3) can be explained by the formation of a quasi-stable non-zero magnetization state. We also found that the initial amplitude of the magnetic field has a strong effect on the relaxation processes.\nWe suggest that the relaxation processes (1) and (2) can be used to study the dynamical properties of the magnetic order in HoBa2Cu3O7-d."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present trigonometric parallax measurements for 26 high-velocity halo white dwarf candidates from the first year data set of the ZTF survey. We find that the largest parallax is 6.36 \u00b1 0.13 arcsec for the white dwarf with the highest velocity, indicating an accuracy of  \u223c 1% in the determination of the distance to the high-velocity halo. We find a correlation between the projected velocity and the cosine of the parallax, but it is not a tight correlation and there are several outliers. We find no evidence of large-scale structure in the high-velocity halo. We derive a density distribution for the high-velocity halo, and find it to be consistent with a King- Defineson distribution with a power law index of 1.70 \u00b1 0.01 and a scale length of 2.2 kpc. We find a total of five subclumps in the high-velocity halo, with the largest subclump having a velocity difference of  \u223c 6 kps from the rest of the halo. The subclumps have a higher density than the rest of the halo, but do not exhibit a different density distribution.

{"text":"\n\nWe investigate the low-frequency (approximately 1\u201330 Hz) bar-mode instability of neutron stars via axisymmetric MHD simulations with the resistivity model ofemption in a generalized poloidal-toroidal coordinate system. The poloidal angle \u00a0is taken to be either 0 or 45 deg, while the toroidal angle \u00a0is varied between 0 and 360 deg. We observe that this instability is driven by a radial mode that is intrinsic to the star and does not depend on the magnetic field. As a result, the bar-mode instability is most sensitive to the thermodynamic properties of the star, and is therefore less efficient at extracting energy from the magnetic field compared to the equally- destabilizing low-T\/|W| subharmonic instability. We also observe that the growth rate of the bar-mode instability is, in general, higher when the poloidal angle is 45 deg instead of 0 deg. This is due to the fact that in the 45 deg case the dominant radial mode is excited at a frequency that is four times smaller than the lowest unstable frequency in the 0 deg case. The bar-mode instability is, however, more efficiently damped by the accretion disk in the 0 deg case. We discuss the physical origin of the radial mode and the relative importance of the different stabilizing effects."}
{"text":"\n\nWe study evolutionary games on minimally structured populations. In particular we consider the evolution of cooperation and of non-linear forms of social organization. We find that in populations where the fitness depends only on the social structure (i.e. populations where the agents are not supposed to be better off by changing their behavior, but only by changing their relationships with other agents), selection always promotes the evolution of cooperation. This result suggests that if agents are able to change their behavior and their relationships with others at the same time, selection will always promote the evolution of non-linear social structures. We show that a standard fitness model which takes into account only the average behavior of the agents (and not their particular relationships) is equivalent to a selection model which promotes the evolution of cooperation. As an application of these results, we study the evolution of social organization in a population of agents with a given behavior structure. We find that the most efficient organizations (in terms of fitness) are non-linear, whereas the most stable organizations are linear. We finally suggest that the difference between the most efficient and the most stable organizations is an important source of evolutionary instability, and that this instability may have important practical consequences."}
{"text":"\n\nWe investigate torsional oscillations of longitudinally inhomogeneous coronal loops. We consider a loop containing a bundle of magnetic flux with a spanwise distribution of density \u03c1(s) that is subject to a twisting moment along its length. We find that the frequency of oscillation is proportional to the inverse of the transit time of a twist along the loop, and inversely proportional to the twist per unit length. We then evaluate the derivative of this frequency with respect to the flux bundle's spanwise density \u03c1(s). This derivative is found to be proportional to the second derivative of \u03c1(s) with respect to s. Our results are consistent with a model in which the loop's torsional oscillations are driven by a twisting moment that is produced by a constant cross-field force acting on the loop's entire length. We find that this model predicts a non-monotonic dependence of the frequency on the loop's density \u03c1(s). We discuss several possible physical mechanisms that could give rise to this behaviour."}
{"text":"\n\nPseudo-random Puncturing: A Technique to Lower the Error Floor of Turbo Codes\n\nWe introduce a new technique, called pseudo-random puncturing, to reduce the error floor of turbo codes. This technique has two key ingredients. The first is to use a carefully designed puncturing pattern to generate a high-rate code with a large minimum distance. The second is to use the turbo codes' feedback loop to remove the correlations that may remain in the high-rate code, and thus approach the channel capacity. We show that with a turbo code of rate R=1\/2 and an interleaver length of 2^n, the new technique can lower the error floor to about (7\/2 + O(1\/n))-dB for a large n. For an interleaver length of 2^n, this means that the number of reliable bits per frame is about (7\/2 + O(1\/n)) times the number of bits that can be reliably transmitted over the channel by the turbo code without any puncturing. This improves on the original turbo code design by about 7 dB. We also show that for large n, the proposed technique converges quickly to its error floor. We implement the proposed technique using both the original turbo code and the recent low-dibit turbo code, and we show that the new technique achieves better performance with both codes."}
{"text":"\nWe have performed infrared microspectroscopy on the organic conductor (TMTSF)2FSO3 to investigate the role of structural defects in the realization of a metal-insulator transition. We found that the thermal evolution of (TMTSF)2FSO3 is characterized by the growth of a new phase, probably a charge-transfer insulator, that coexists with the metallic phase. The metallic phase has a monoclinic structure with a=10.62 \u00c5, b=6.39 \u00c5, and c=3.52 \u00c5, and the insulating phase has a different monoclinic structure with a=10.89 \u00c5, b=6.54 \u00c5, and c=3.51 \u00c5. The interface between these two phases has a very high density of structural defects. In particular, we found that the insulating phase has a lower density of charge-transfer molecular species than the metallic phase, indicating that the formation of the insulating phase is associated with a loss of charge-transfer interaction. We also found that the structural defects in the insulating phase are responsible for the transport properties of this material, and that the mobility is extremely low because of strong electron-phonon interaction."}
{"text":"\n\nReality of linear and angular momentum expectation values in bound states.\nWe have performed a systematic investigation of the properties of bound states of the hydrogen molecular ion, with particular attention to the roles of linear and angular momentum. We show that the large majority of bound states of this system have their angular momenta aligned in the general direction of the total angular momentum of the system. This is in spite of the fact that the magnetic moments of the nuclei can, in principle, act as a source of pure orbital angular momentum. We show this by performing a statistical analysis of the orientation of the angular momentum in a large number of bound states. The most probable value of the total angular momentum in these bound states is found to be very close to the magnitude of the total angular momentum of the unbound system. In addition, the statistics of the linear momentum distribution in these bound states is found to be in agreement with the statistics of the bound state energy distribution, thus providing further evidence for the reality of the linear momentum expectation value in bound states."}
{"text":"\nWe have performed a detailed experimental investigation of rich methane premixed laminar flames doped by light unsaturated hydrocarbons - allene and propyne. Two kinds of burners were used: a Reynolds-numbers based burner and a constant-pressure burner. We have measured the extinction limits for these flames in the presence of various hydrocarbon doping concentrations, the flame temperature, and the radical species concentrations. We have found that the extinction limit for these flames is not affected by the doping and is limited by the fuel-to-air ratio. The temperature of the flame core is not affected by the doping, but the temperature of the unburned mixture fraction is significantly decreased. The increase of the radical species concentrations in the burned mixture fraction is not significant. We have found that the consumption of the doping hydrocarbons is relatively fast, the half-time of allene being about 1ms. In the burned mixture fraction the concentrations of 2-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-propanenal (HMPA) and of 3-methyl-2-butanone (MBO) are significantly increased, while the concentrations of peroxy radicals are not affected. We have performed a comparison between these flames and propane-doped methane flames. We have found that the extinction limits of these two kinds of flames are similar, but the flame temperature and the radical species concentrations are different.\n\nWe have also performed a comparison between the combustion of these light unsaturated hydrocarbons in air and in methane. We have found that the consumption rates of these hydrocarbons are much higher in methane than in air, the half-times being about 0.1ms and 1s, respectively. We have also found that the concentrations of HMPA and MBO are very similar in both media, while the concentrations of peroxy radicals are much higher in air.\n\nThese results are discussed in the framework of the current literature."}
{"text":"\n\nExponential growth rates in a typed branching diffusion\n\nWe consider a branching diffusion with a general state space and constant coefficients. The branching parameter may be chosen to generate a wide range of different dynamical behaviours. We find that for certain choices of the branching parameter, the associated branching diffusion exhibits exponential growth rates. We show that these growth rates can be understood in terms of a simple model in which the branches of the diffusion are interpreted as localised realisations of a deterministic delta-shaped potential field. We prove that this model has an exponentially growing solution, and show that this solution can be related to the solutions of the branching diffusion. This provides a simple explanation for the occurrence of exponential growth rates in the branching diffusion.\n\nWe thank Luis Classroom, Andrew Fisher and Heiko Riedel for useful discussions.

{"text":"\nWe present a theoretical study of the structure and properties of $^9$Be, $^{14}$N, $^7$Be, and $^8$B nuclei in relativistic fragmentation. The motivation for our work is to better understand the role of the strong and weak interactions in shaping the structure and properties of these nuclei. Our key ideas and methodology are based on the use of the relativistic random phase approximation (RRPA) to describe the strong interactions, and the inclusion of the weak interactions via the generalized folded-form (GFF) approach. Our results show that the strong interactions play a significant role in shaping the structure and properties of these nuclei, with the relative importance of the strong and weak interactions varying depending on the nucleus and the range of the applied external field. We also found that the GFF approach is capable of describing the weak interactions in these nuclei, and that the inclusion of the weak interactions can lead to a better agreement between theory and experiment.\n\nOur work attempts to solve the problem of understanding the role of the strong and weak interactions in shaping the structure and properties of these nuclei, and has practical implications for the design of experiments to study these nuclei. Our findings also have theoretical implications for future research, as they suggest that the strong and weak interactions play a significant role in shaping the structure and properties of these nuclei."}
{"text":"\nWe present a search for sterile neutrinos at the Cryogenic Underground Laboratory for Rare Events (CUORE), which is currently operating at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) in Villigen, Switzerland. The search is based on the conversion of weakly excited nuclear states in a large detector composed of tons of Xenon gas. We have identified a large number of events in which a neutrino participated in the conversion of a nuclear state. In order to establish the potential of the detector to search for sterile neutrinos, we have studied the properties of the events in which a neutrino is involved and compared them to the properties of events in which only electromagnetic radiation participates. We show that the detector is sensitive to the telltale signatures of a sterile neutrino and that it has the potential to reach the current sensitivity goal of the Cryogenic Upper-endregion\nof the atmosphere (CUORE) experiment, which is to establish whether or not sterile neutrinos exist with a sensitivity level of $3\\times10^{-39}\\, \\text{eV}^{-1}$. We present the latest results from the analysis of a dataset collected with the detector in its latest configuration, and we discuss the future of the experiment."}
{"text":"\nWe consider the evolution of an orbital coupling constant (the Carter constant) for an arbitrary attracting solution of the Inspiral problem, which describes the fate of a particle or a small compact object in a generic potential field, as it approaches a point of singularity (a black hole). In particular, we investigate the contribution to this evolution made by the gravitational field of the black hole. Our main results are the following. First, we show that the contribution of the black hole to the evolution of the Carter constant is mainly due to the black hole quadrupole moment. Second, we give an approximation for this evolution in the limit of a small Carter constant. Third, we show that in this approximation the evolution is governed by the two-body problem, and hence it has a well-defined analytical structure. This structure expresses the evolution in terms of the singularity formalism, and therefore our results are consistent with the prediction of theogy. Finally, we show that the contribution of the black hole is to a slow-down of the evolution of the Carter constant. Our results are consistent with the two-body problem being the effective theory of the evolution of the Carter constant for most attracting solutions which approach a black hole."}
{"text":"\n\nWe investigate the effect of lesions on cortical networks using a combination of computational modeling and multi-electrode recordings in non-human primates. We show that the response to lesions depends on the network topology and the location of the lesion, and we identify three different robust responses to lesions: 0-resilience, 1-resilience, and 2-resilience. We show that 0-resilience can be achieved if the spared neurons are able to recruit alternative inputs to compensate for the lost connections, 1-resilience is possible if the spared neurons receive at least one synaptic input that is not affected by the lesion, and 2-resilience is achieved if the network is able to reconfigure itself such that at least one synaptic input to each spared neuron remains. We also show that the degree to which a network is resilient to lesions can be predicted based on the clustering and path length of the network. Finally, we discuss how our findings can be used to guide the development of cortical implants."}
{"text":"\nWe establish an invariance principle for semimartingale reflecting Brownian motions in domains with piecewise smooth boundaries. The motivation for this research is the fact that in the study of the dynamics of quantum particles in a many-body system, the description of the evolution of the system is often done by considering the motion of a certain semimartingale, called the disturbance, reflecting at the boundary of the system. We show that such a disturbance evolving according to a certain invariance principle gives rise to a class of semimartingale reflecting Brownian motions in domains with piecewise smooth boundaries, generalizing results in the literature on invariance principles for Brownian motions in similar situations. The key ideas in the proof of the main results are the use of a stochastic counterpart of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation, the invariance of the generating functionals of the reflecting integrals and a boundary conditions for the evolution operator of the semimartingale. As an application, we show that our results can be used to establish an invariance principle for certain families of Brownian semimartingales."}

{"text":"\n\nWe present a study of the star-forming region CB54 in the Bok globule M78. This analysis includes an examination of the radio source properties, the hydrogen content, and the infra-red and visible structural properties of CB54. Our results suggest that the region is a small but well-defined cluster of molecular clouds. We have derived a total mass of 1.2 x 10^5 M$_{\\odot}$ for the cloud core, which contains 4.3 x 10^3 M$_{\\odot}$ in the form of gas and 1.9 x 10^3 M$_{\\odot}$ in the form of dust. We have found 6 radio sources in CB54, two of which are double sources. We have determined the angular distributions of the radio sources in the region and found that they are distributed in a way that is consistent with an infra-red image of the region obtained by IRAS. The radio sources show a high degree of symmetry and are confined to the same region as the infra-red sources. The physical conditions of the gas in the region, as obtained from the 1.4 GHz data, are consistent with those required for star formation. The gas is relatively warm (13 K higher than the average K=2.2 K), and it contains a relatively high fraction of CO (1.5%). These properties suggest that star formation is indeed occurring in the region. The distribution of the radio sources and the infra-red sources is consistent with the scenario in which the radio sources are young stellar objects, embedded in a mescopic cloud core, that are being accreted by the infra-red sources. The structure of CB54 is consistent with the gravitational collapse of a cloud core. We have derived the three-dimensional distribution of the mass in the region and found that it is very well described by a uniform density core with a radius of 1.2 pc and a density of $\\sim 10^{-3}$ kg m$^{-3}$. The density is higher at the core centre, $\\sim 10^{-2.5}$ kg m$^{-3}$, and it decreases smoothly with radius. We discuss our results in the framework of the low-mass star formation theory."}
{"text":"\n\nWe study type D Einstein spacetimes in higher dimensions. We show that such spacetimes can be fully described by a restricted set of solutions of the Einstein field equations which we call basic solutions. This description can be used to give a simple and elegant derivation and formulation of the type D Einstein spacetime in any dimension greater than two. We also show that, if the principal null directions are arranged in a certain way, the type D Einstein spacetime in higher dimensions can be made to have a simple structure in which the spacetime can be expressed as a special type of curved spacetime in a lower dimension. We show that this special structure is related to the principal null directions in a way which allows the type D Einstein spacetime to be understood as a special type of anti-de Sitter spacetime. We show that the de Sitter spacetime can be obtained as a special limiting case of this type D Einstein spacetime in higher dimensions. The results of this paper have been published in the companion paper 'Basic solutions for type D Einstein spacetimes in higher dimensions'."}
{"text":"\n\nThe detection and characterization of extra-solar planets and planetary systems is a primary goal of current astronomical research, and the motivation for this work. The extrasolar planet hunt has been largely carried out using a few methods that are sensitive to the orbital motion of a massive planet. The most successful method, and the one that has found the most extra-solar planets, has been the detection of a reflex motion in the host star as a massive planet orbits the star. In a massive planet the reflex motion is due to the star's gravity, which acts through the intervening spaces, as well as the gravity of the planet. This reflex motion can be detected as a small periodic motion in the radial velocity of the star. This method has been very successful, but only detects massive planets in wide orbits. There have been several efforts to detect low-mass planets in tight orbits around their host star. The most successful method has been precise photometry of the host star as the planet orbits. There have been a few Claims of detection, but most of these have not survived further analysis. We have developed a new method that uses astrometric data from the Hipparchus satellite to search for low-mass planets in tight orbits around their host stars. In this paper we present the results of our search for a planetary companion to the nearby young star AU Microscopii. We find that the Hipparchus data are consistent with a single star, and we set a 90% confidence limit on the ratio of the star's proper motion to the planet's proper motion at 4.1. This limit excludes a planet with a mass greater than 0.8 Jupiter if it is in a circular orbit with a distance of at most 2.4 AU, or a mass greater than 2.1 Jupiter if it is in an eccentric orbit with a distance of at most 1.9 AU. We conclude that a massive planetary companion to AU Mic is unlikely."}
{"text":"\nWe introduce a new approach to engineering the standard model, based on local unfolding of the three families of its underlying geometric structure, the E8 particle multiplet. This approach has the advantage of being completely genus independent, thus avoiding the delicate procedure of raising the dignity of the standard model that is inherent in the conventional approach based on \"GEeses\". We show that this approach leads to a natural and transparent definition of the standard model in the case where the three families have the same number of constituent particles, in terms of an appropriate realization of the fundamental quiver. In particular, the standard model is fully determined by the (real or virtual) E8 singularity, and the three families are unfolded from it by locating the 24 nodal points of the E8 diagram on the 24 corners of a suitable 8-cell. In the case where the number of constituent particles of the three families is different, the standard model is not uniquely determined by the E8 singularity, and we show that the most natural choice is to identify the standard model with the partition of the 24 corners of the 8-cell in three subsets of eight corners each. We comment on the relation between our approach and the standard approaches based on GEeses, and on the relation with the \"Geometric Standard Model\" of SUMMARY."}
{"text":"\nWe present a detailed analysis of the X-ray absorption lines in a large number of observations of the black hole candidate Cygnus X-1. We find that the lines are extremely broad and exhibit a dramatic variability in both their shapes and their positions. This variability has several features that are common to the different observations, but there are also many differences. We find that the lines are typically structured in a way that is consistent with a broad resonance around 7200 km\/s, but there are also many observations in which this resonance is highly structured, with multiple peaks and\/or deep dips. We present a model in which the lines are produced in a turbulent accretion flow with a broad resonance, and show that this model can reproduce many of the features of the observed lines, but there are also many observations that are not well described by this model. We discuss several possible physical mechanisms that could produce the observed variability, and argue that the most likely explanation is that the accretion flow is intrinsically variable on time scales of days to weeks, and this variability is superimposed on a background of much longer-term variability (years to decades) due to processes in the broad accretion flow. We also present a model in which the lines are produced in an accretion flow with a strong temperature gradient, and find that this model can reproduce many of the features of the observed lines, including their broadness and some of the structure. We discuss the implications of our results for the nature of the accretion flow, and for the prospects of using X-ray absorption lines to study the inner accretion flow in black holes."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a space-based microlens survey strategy that uses a combination of fine-grained photometry and astrometry to census extrasolar planets around Milky Way stars. Our method is based on a statistical analysis of the intrinsic microlens light-curve shape and an evaluation of the accuracy with which such curves can be measured. We show that the survey can achieve a level of sensitivity such that it would be capable of detecting planets the size of Mars at the distance of the Earth from the Sun, provided that they are not more than a few AU from their host stars. We describe the types of cameras and telescopes that would be needed for such a survey, and the data processing and telescope\/instrument handling required, and present an analysis of the likely yield of the survey. We find that a 5-year survey using a single 1-m telescope would be capable of detecting at least one image per year, and that a network of 4 such telescopes would be capable of detecting up to 10 images per year. We also find that, given the current distribution of telescope time, a survey such as this would require a dedicated telescope network. We discuss the various types of follow-up observations that could be used to characterize the exoplanets detected."}
{"text":"\n\nUSco1606-1935: An Unusually Wide Low-Mass Triple System?\n\nWe present phase-resolved spectroscopy and photometry of the low-mass triple system USco1606-1935, which contains an unexpectedly wide AB-system and a relatively close spectroscopic binary. The system consists of a low-mass star (M \u223c 0.20 M\u2299) with a low-mass giant companion (M \u223c 1.36 M\u2299) in a wide orbit, and a very low-mass companion (M \u223c 0.016 M\u2299) in a much tighter orbit. The giant planet has a large orbital eccentricity (e \u223c 1.6), and our observations also reveal significant orbital inclination (i \u223c 85\u00b0). This makes the system, with a period of \u223c95 years, unusually wide for a low-mass triple. The very low-mass object is likely to be a large terrestrial planet or a small gas giant. We estimate the age of the system to be \u223c7 Gyr, which is consistent with the wide orbit of the giant planet. The system is a member of the \u03b1 Centauri moving group, and so is probably a member of the thin disk. This is in contrast to most of the members of this group, which are thick disk objects. We discuss this system in the context of models of giant planet formation, and suggest that this system could provide important constraints on giant planet formation models."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present new Faraday rotation measures (RMs) of 21 extragalactic radio sources behind the southern Galactic plane, and use these data in combination with published data to probe the large-scale structure of the Milky Way's magnetic field. We show that this field has a butterfly-shaped structure with two oppositely directed magnetic poles located near the sunward and antisunward sides of the Galactic plane. The sunward magnetic pole is associated with the Sagittarius- Carina spiral arm, whereas the antisunward magnetic pole is located between the Scutum-Crux and Norma-Cygnus spiral arms. The magnetic field is strongest in the direction of the Galactic plane, with a maximum field strength of 4.6 kG in the sunward direction and -4.1 kG in the antisunward direction. We show that the large-scale field structure we observe is consistent with a model in which the magnetic field is generated by a rotating Galactic disk with implanted dipole moments, and is potentially confounded by large-scale Alfv\u00e9n waves excited by the orbital motion of the sun and the rest of the Galactic disk. We discuss a potential experimental test of this model by means of radio galaxies positioned in the Galactic halo."}
{"text":"\n\nWe investigate a model of entanglement generation inspired by a recent proposal [F. Costa, Phys. Rev.

In this setting, we show that a substantial increase of entanglement can be achieved by a suitable choice of the map, even in the limit of a large number of qubits. In particular, we show that the map can be chosen in such a way that the entanglement is concentrated in a small fraction of the qubits, leading to a scalable scheme for the generation of entanglement. We also show that such a scheme can be efficient even for relatively large entanglement generation, in the sense that the resources needed to generate a given amount of entanglement, in terms of the number of operations and qubits, are of order of magnitude of the resources needed to generate the same amount of entanglement in the standard scheme, in which the entanglement is generated directly by a local Hamiltonian."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present photometric detections of dust emission at 1.3 and 1.4 \u03bcm around the pre-main sequence M1 dwarf TWA 7 using the Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) on board the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). These data are combined with existing photometry at 1.7 \u03bcm and 2.2 \u03bcm from the Near-Infrared Multi-Mirror Telescope (NIRMT) to yield the first three-band photometric study of the TWA 7 debris disk. We determine the mass of the disk to be 18 lunar masses (0.2 Earth masses) assuming a mass opacity of 1.7 cm2\/g with a temperature of 45 K. This makes the TWA 7 disk (d=55 pc) a lower mass analog to the disk reported around AU Microscopii (GL 803), the closest (9.9 pc) debris disk detected around an M dwarf. We discuss this disk in the context of known disks around low-mass stars; a comparison of masses of disks around M and K stars shows that the disks around M stars have masses that are roughly two orders of magnitude smaller than those around K stars. We also discuss our data in the context of known debris disk temperatures; the TWA 7 disk temperature is roughly five times greater than that of the disk reported around AU Microscopii."}
{"text":"\n\nWe have carried out a modeling study of X-ray continuum emission from accretion disks around black hole candidates in galaxies within 50 Mpc, using the observed photometric redshifts of the host galaxies. We find that the accretion disk X-ray continuum luminosity is in the range of 1036 - 1038 erg s-1. The derived black hole mass is in the range of 109 - 1011 M\u2299, which is consistent with the black hole mass range found in our Galaxy. The properties of the accretion disks, such as the accretion rate, disk scale height, and disk temperature, are derived. We find that the disk scale height is in the range of 5 - 10 times the black hole event horizon radius, and the disk temperature is in the range of 0.4 - 2 keV. These results suggest that accretion disks around black hole candidates are relatively inefficient in transforming the accreted matter into X-rays, compared to accretion disks around known black holes in our Galaxy. This may be due to the lack of a jet emerging from the accretion disk around these black hole candidates. The accretion disk around a black hole candidate in the galaxy NGC 4438 is particularly interesting because the disk is inclined to the line of sight, and it shows the inner accretion disk structure revealed by the X-ray emission line. We discuss the possible mechanisms of generating the X-rays from the accretion disks around these black hole candidates, and compare our results with the results of recent numerical simulations of accretion disks around black holes."}
{"text":"\n\nWe show that the problem of deciding whether a given weighted edge biclique can be extended to a maximum weighted edge biclique in a bipartite graph is NP-hard. This answers a question of Fulkerson [15] and is motivated by applications in computer vision, image and shape analysis, where the maximum weighted edge biclique problem arises in the context of realizing an image as the union of a minimal number of ideal rectangular tiles. We show that an approximation algorithm that achieves a 1.25 approximation for the problem can be derived from a probabilistic argument that the number of edge-disjoint non-empty sets of size three in a random graph is about 1.25 the number of edges. The probabilistic algorithm is implemented by selecting a random edge and recursively trying to add it to one of the existing sets of size three. We show that the number of edge-disjoint sets of size three is an approximate sum of independent random variables, which implies that the number of edge-disjoint sets of size three is almost surely equal to the number of edges in a graph selected uniformly at random from the set of all bipartite graphs with a fixed number of edges per side. As an application, we show that the probabilistic algorithm can be used to obtain a simple random sampling algorithm for generating random images whose pixels are distributed approximately independently."}
{"text":"\nWe present photometric and spectroscopic observations of the cluster of galaxies Sersic 159-03, in which a strong soft excess is present in the optical light. We show that this excess is optically thin and that it does not follow the main cluster light as it would if it were due to dust. We point out that such a feature can be produced by non-thermal emission in the radio regime, and we derive a simple model in which a few hundred million solar masses of molecular gas at an average temperature of about 30 K is responsible for the observed soft excess. The model is consistent with the cluster being in a state of virial equilibrium, but it requires that the gas be (at least approximately) collisionless. We discuss possible physical mechanisms that could produce such a large non-thermal component and conclude that none of them seems particularly favoured by the observations. We also discuss the implications of this non-thermal component for cluster cooling and for the study of the thermal history of clusters."}
{"text":"\n\nThe Transition from the First Stars to the Second Stars in the Early Universe\n\nWe present a model of the transition from the first stars to the second stars in the early universe. The first stars, also known as Population III stars, are believed to have formed in the early universe, perhaps as early as 100-200 million years after the Big Bang. These stars were likely to be very massive and very hot, and they would have quickly burned through their supplies of hydrogen fuel. The second stars, also known as Population II stars, are thought to have formed later, perhaps as late as 10-20 billion years after the Big Bang. These stars were likely to be less massive and less hot than the first stars, and they would have burned through their supplies of hydrogen fuel more slowly.\n\nOur model shows that the transition from the first stars to the second stars is likely to have been a gradual process, with the first stars slowly being replaced by the second stars. We find that the number of first stars will be greatest when the universe is around 1-2 billion years old, and that the number of second stars will be greatest when the universe is around 5-6 billion years old. Our model also suggests that the first stars were likely to be much more massive than the second stars, and that they would have been very hot. The second stars would have been much less massive than the first stars, and they would have been much cooler.\n\nOur results have important implications for the evolution of the early universe. The first stars were likely to be very massive, and their formation would have had a major impact on the evolution of the early universe. The second stars were likely to be much less massive, and their formation would have had a much smaller impact on the evolution of the early universe.

{"text":"\nWe present a kinematic analysis of 23 globular clusters with extended horizontal branches, found in a statistical survey of Hickson Compact Groups. We determine the kinematic properties of the clusters, and we investigate the dynamical structure of the group in which they are contained.

We find that the globular clusters are kinematically decoupled from the extended horizontal-branch stars, except in one case. We show that the probability distribution of the fraction of the total velocity in the group that is due to the core globular clusters is consistent with the clusters having random orbits, with no significant correlation between the velocity and the distance from the group center. This is in contrast to the extended horizontal-branch stars, for which we find a strong correlation between velocity and distance. We discuss these results in the context of the dynamical structure of the groups, and we analyze the kinematic stability of the clusters. We show that the core globular clusters are dynamically stable, but that the extended horizontal-branch stars are not. We discuss the implications of our results for the dynamical evolution of these groups, and for the dynamical structure of globular clusters in general."}
{"text":"\nWe refute the pseudo attack on the REESSE1+ cryptosystem. Our motivation is that the pseudo attack can cause a false impression about the security of REESSE1+. The key idea is that the pseudo attack uses a fake (i.e. not truly random) entropy source. We show that as long as the entropy source is not revealed, an attacker can only suspect that it is not truly random. We also show that even if the entropy source is revealed, the pseudo attack does not help to break REESSE1+. As a by-product, we show that the standardize step in the pseudo attack is not necessary. Our methodology is to consider a simple instantiation of REESSE1+ with a standardize step, and show that this instantiation is secure, regardless of whether the pseudo attack is applied or not. Our results are that REESSE1+ is secure, regardless of whether the pseudo attack is applied or not. We also show that the pseudo attack does not help to break any generic instantiation of REESSE1+. As a practical application, our results imply that the pseudo attack does not threaten the security of REESSE1+, even if the entropy source is not truly random. As a theoretical application, our results imply that the pseudo attack is not a generic attack on allRAND-based (or BP-based) cryptosystems, even if the entropy source is not truly random."}

The motivation for this work is to provide a robust and well-defined geometrically continuous surface model in the absence of any a-priori assumptions on the geometry of the data. We show that the surface is well-defined and robust by proving that it is insensitive to small additions or removals of vertices and edges in the underlying triangle mesh. We show that this surface is also geometrically meaningful by proving that it has a well-defined and continuous normal vector field. We further prove that the surface model is isometric to the originally input mesh in the sense that it preserves the angles between adjacent triangles. We show that this surface model can be used to develop a simple, yet effective algorithm for computing geodesic paths on the surface. We implement this algorithm and show that the computed geodesic paths are sensitive to small perturbations of the surface model."}

{"text":"\n\nWe study the fusion process of heavy nuclei in the framework of a time dependent Hartree-Fock theory. The theory is based on the coupling of the Hartree-Fock kernel with the Equation of Motion (EOM) and includes a preequilibrium giant dipole resonance (GDR) in the fused system. We find that the pre-equilibrium GDR in the fused system affects the fusion process in a different way for different incident nuclei. For example the data for the fusion of Li with deuterium is in good agreement with the prediction of the theory, while the data for the fusion of hydrogen with deuterium is in disagreement with the prediction of the theory. We also find the fusion of tritium with deuterium to be in disagreement with the prediction of the theory. The theory predicts a strong effect of the pre-equilibrium GDR in the system on the fusion process. Our result is in agreement with the recent experimental data for the fusion of heavy nuclei, but does not explain the disagreement between the prediction of the theory and some experimental data."}
{"text":"\n\nWe investigate cooperative wireless relay networks in which the nodes can help each other in data transmission. We consider the problem of finding an optimal route for data to be transmitted from a source to a destination via a relay node. We propose a general framework for finding the optimal route in terms of the rate-distortion region. The optimal route is obtained by solving a general min-sum integer program, which is shown to have a special structure that can be leveraged for efficient solution. We consider both practical scenarios where the network is operated in a decode-and-forward fashion, and theoretical scenarios where the network is operated in a hear-and-forward fashion. In the practical scenario, we propose a heuristic algorithm to find the optimal route with low computational complexity. The proposed algorithm is shown to achieve near-optimal performance through simulations. In the theoretical scenario, we show that the optimal route is equivalent to finding a longest path in a graph, which can be solved in polynomial time. We also investigate the effect of different network parameters and show that the proposed framework is flexible and can be easily extended to accommodate various system settings."}
{"text":"\nWe consider a probabilistic cellular automaton describing the dynamics of coexistence of a predator-prey system with infinite total population and study the conditions for the emergence of self-sustained limit cycles. The automaton is mean-field, i.e. the local stochastic update rules are inspired on the processes of the elementary units (the cells) without taking into account their spatial arrangement. We find that a spatial structure of patches, in which the prey has an advantage over the predator, is necessary for the emergence of self-sustained limit cycles. We also show that limit cycles can be stable against changes in the initial conditions and, in this case, the automaton has a global steady state in which the number of prey and predator cells is independent of the initial conditions. As an example application, we consider a patchy landscape where the local stochastic rules describe the dynamics of the limiting case of the ratio of the prey and predator densities, as obtained from a simple ecological model with patchy spatial structure. We show that this model has a stable limit cycle and the conditions for its emergence are similar to the ones obtained for the mean-field case."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present photometric observations of SDSS J233325.92+152222.1, an intermediate polar with a long spin period (41.34 \u00b1 0.07 min), which contains an unusual abundance of magnetic material. We found a correlation between the stellar oblateness and the magnetic flux, which is in agreement with the prediction of the Cold Torque Model. Our data also reveal a direct proportionality between the spin frequency and the surface magnetic flux, which may provide a new way to quantitatively estimate the magnetic field strength in intermediate polars. We found that this relation is much better if the spin frequency is defined not in the whole frequency domain, but only in the part of it where the torque equilibrium is reached. The obtained proportionality constant gives the efficiency of the magnetic braking. Our observations also suggest that the kinematic age of the system is about 2 Gyr. The star contains an inner hot core with a size of about 1 R \u2299, which is a few times smaller than the observed radiative outer layer. The low mass of the core and the large frequency of rotation in comparison to other intermediate polars indicate that the star has been efficiently braking its spin during the last several billion years. The distribution of the magnetic field in the star is very inhomogeneous, which results in a very large torque on the star. We show that a large torque results in a large spin frequency, but it may also cause a large decline in the spin frequency due to magnetic braking. We estimate the magnetic braking efficiency in the star and find that it is much higher than in other intermediate polars. We explain this by a large value of the magnetic moment of the inner core in comparison to other intermediate polars. We also discuss other possible physical mechanisms responsible for the high braking efficiency."}
{"text":"\n\nConsiderations of complexity are common in computer science. We present a complexity consideration which has not been well studied: the worst-case running time of a randomized algorithm which is guaranteed to output the correct answer with a probability of 2-1 is at most a constant factor larger than the worst-case running time of the same algorithm without the guarantee. This answers a question oficzkowski andzlatar in the negative: it is not sufficient for an $\\mathcal{O}(\\log n)$ algorithm to output the correct answer with probability 2-1 in order to achieve an $\\mathcal{O}(n)$ worst-case running time. We show that the probability of the output of a randomized algorithm achieving any given confidence level is closely related to the worst-case running time of the same algorithm. We show that the class of problems which can be solved in worst-case $\\mathcal{O}(n)$ time by a randomized algorithm which outputs the correct answer with probability 2-1 is the same as the class of problems which can be solved in worst-case $\\mathcal{O}(n)$ time by a deterministic algorithm. We show how to use the study of randomized algorithms which output the correct answer with high probability to obtain new lower bounds for the complexity of several important problems."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a spatially resolved study of the inner few pc of the prototypical hot core G29.96-0.02 with high angular resolution molecular line imaging. We find that the ionized gas reservoir is extremely compact, with a radius of only $\\sim$1.4 pc, while the molecular hydrogen reservoir is more extended, with a radius of $\\sim$4.3 pc. The ionized gas is only weakly clumpy, in contrast to the molecular gas which is highly non-uniform, with a high density core surrounded by a number of clumps. We estimate the mass of the core to be $M_{\\rm gas} \\sim 2.4 M_{\\odot}$, which is not in agreement with the simplest single-zone models for the chemical evolution of the Galactic disc. We discuss this in the framework of the so-called $\\alpha$-Enhancement theory, and suggest that the low $M_{\\rm gas}$ could be explained by a low $Z$-value of the initial gas, a low efficiency of the chemical evolution and\/or a low mass yield from thenova-burst events. We also discuss the question of the efficiency of the molecular hydrogen cooling in this and other hot cores."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider a model of an antiferromagnetic insulator with a small magnetic moment $\\mu$ in an applied external magnetic field $H$. At low temperatures, below the quantum critical temperature $T_c$, the system remains in its stable state, but on increasing the temperature, a number of excitations with fractional charges $\\pm e\/2$ appear, which are related to the formation of a spectral gap. We show that, for a certain range of temperatures, these excitations can be stable against thermal fluctuations. Our results are consistent with the idea that a system with $\\pm e\/2$ excitations is in a glassy state, and they suggest that such a state can be achieved by a small change in the number of quasiparticles from a state with all excitations having the charge $e$. The model we study is an extension of the Sherrington- Kirkpatrick model, which has a number of experimental realizations. Our results are consistent with the behavior observed in spin glasses, but we also show that a small change in the number of quasiparticles can lead to a glassy state with a different number of excitations than the one found in a spin glass."}
{"text":"\n\nWe investigate the many-to-one throughput capacity of IEEE 802.11 multi-hop wireless networks. In contrast to single-hop networks, where the many-to-one throughput capacity grows proportionally with the number of nodes, the many-to-one throughput capacity of multi-hop networks has a far more complicated growth behavior. We show that the many-to-one throughput capacity of multi-hop networks has a super-exponential growth with the number of nodes when the number of hops is fixed and the wireless link errors are independent and identically distributed. The many-to-one throughput capacity is shown to have a sub-exponential growth with the number of nodes when the number of hops is allowed to vary and\/or the wireless link errors are not independent and identically distributed. We also investigate the asymptotic behavior of the many-to-one throughput capacity when the network size grows large and the hops-to-node ratio is fixed. Our results show that the many-to-one throughput capacity is not a sharp threshold, as was previously believed, but a gradual function of the number of nodes. In practical multi-hop networks, the many-to-one throughput capacity is often limited by the finite buffer size in intermediate nodes. We analyze the effect of the buffer size on the many-to-one throughput capacity and show that a sufficient large buffer size is critical to achieve a high many-to-one throughput capacity. We also propose a simple scheme to achieve a high many-to-one throughput capacity in multi-hop networks. simulation results show that our proposed scheme can significantly increase the many-to-one throughput capacity."}
{"text":"\nWe have performed non-resonant and resonant X-ray scattering studies on single crystals of TbMn2O5, a paramagnetic metal with a canting magnetic structure below its Curie temperature. The non-resonant results show a non-monotonic temperature dependence of the X-ray intensities in the magnetic reflection, consistent with the existence of a structural phase transition at T ~ 100 K. Resonant X-ray scattering results show a clear dependence of the X-ray intensity in the magnetic reflection on the magnetic field applied along the canting direction. The temperature dependence of the X-ray intensity in the magnetic reflection for a magnetic field applied along the easy axis follows a monotonic curve, consistent with the existence of a magnetic phase transition at T ~ 120 K. In addition, we have observed a clear signature of a skyrmion lattice in the X-ray data for a magnetic field applied along the hard axis. Our results suggest that the magnetic skyrmion lattice is formed by the coupling between the magnetic and structural degrees of freedom."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a numerical study of self-diffusion and interdiffusion in Al80Ni20 melts, using the Monte Carlo method for statistical equilibrium simulation. Our goals are to evaluate the accuracy of the Monte Carlo method for this type of problem, and to compare the results with experimental data. The statistical equilibrium approach is capable of describing the behavior of the various diffusion mechanisms in the Al80Ni20 melts, in agreement with experimental data. The main difference between simulation and experiment is that the former shows no temperature dependence of the self-diffusion coefficient, in contrast to the experiments where the self-diffusion coefficient increases with temperature. We attribute this to the fact that the experimental data were obtained by analyzing the penetration profiles of radioactive tracers, which were used to probe the melt. The experimental data therefore contain contributions from all the possible diffusion mechanisms, while our simulation considers only self-diffusion and interdiffusion. We also analyze the effect of various simulation parameters on the results, and we identify the parameters which have the greatest effect on the quality of the simulation."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a model of globular cluster (GC) formation in massive elliptical galaxies that simultaneously explains the observations of: (i) a correlation between the metallicity of the globular cluster system and the orbital radius of the system, (ii) the coexistence of metal-poor and metal-rich clusters in the same system, and (iii) the correlation between the dynamical state of clusters and their metallicities. The model consists of a Globular ClusterFormation Model (GCFM) coupled to a N-body orbit evolution model, which is further coupled to a Radial Variation of Stellar Populations (RSP) model. The GCFM describes the formation and evolution of globular clusters in massive elliptical galaxies. The RSP model describes the radial variation of stellar populations in massive elliptical galaxies, which affects the orbital distribution of clusters. We show that the combined effect of the GCFM and the RSP model is to produce the observed correlations between the metallicity of the cluster system and the orbital radius of the system, as well as the observed correlations between the dynamical state of clusters and their metallicities. We further show that the coexistence of metal-poor and metal-rich clusters in the same system is a natural outcome of the combined effects of the GCFM and the RSP model."}
{"text":"\nWe report the observation of the fifth outburst of the periodic Supergiant Fast X-ray Transient IGR J11215-5952 in April-May 2016. The outburst was detected in late April by the monitor of the RXTE Long Life Survey and was followed by a 6-month-long monitoring campaign by RXTE, XMM-Newton, and Swift, which ended in November 2016. We find that the accretion phase lasted longer than previously observed outbursts, approximately 60 ks, and was characterized by high accretion rates of \u00a00.35\u20130.55 s^(\u22121). We attribute the unusually long accretion phase to the fade-in of the accretion after the onset, which is possibly connected with the transit of the donor star in front of the accretor. The observed phenomenology of the outburst can be described with a model in which the accretion is driven by the orbital decay of the donor star around the accretor and the accretion is episodic, with the accretion lobe geometry being modified by the orbital evolution. We discuss the evolutionary status of the system and its long-term fate."}
{"text":"\nWe present here the results of a study of the mid-infrared fine structure line ratios in 98 active galactic nuclei (AGN) observed with Spitzer IRS. The observations were made with the Multiband Imaging Photometer for Spitzer (MIPS) and the InfraRed Array Camera (IRAC), with an average sensitivity of 5sigma on an integration time of $\\sim30$ ks. The sample is complete for galaxies with $M_{\\rm gas} > 10^{10} M_{\\odot}$ and $10^{42} M_{\\odot} \\ year^{-1}$, with $L_{\\rm IR} > 10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$, and is almost complete for galaxies with $M_{\\rm gas} \\sim 10^{10}$ M$_{\\odot}$, $L_{\\rm IR} \\sim 10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$. We find that the fine structure line ratio $\\lambda_{\\rm rest} \/ \\lambda_{\\rm complex}$ is on average 1.5 +- 0.5. This is significantly different from the ratio of 1.0 predicted by simple models in which the line-forming region is assumed to be a uniform disc. The observed line ratio varies smoothly with both the ionization timescale and the black hole spin velocity. The standard deviation of the line ratio is $\\sim 0.6$. We show that simple models of a non-uniform line-forming region can explain the observations, provided that the line-forming region is either a flared torus or a disc with a hole at the centre. We discuss our results in the context of other observations of the ionization structure in AGN, and in terms of the size and density distribution of the line-forming region. We show that the simplest model that explains our observations is a flared torus with a hole at the centre, and we discuss the implications of this for future observations of this important region."}
{"text":"\n\nWe show that non-Abelian gauge fields can be treated as the pseudo-Goldstone vector bosons caused by spontaneous Lorentz invariance violation (SLIV). To this end, we first recall the basics of SLIV and its possible Implications for the structure of space-time and elementary particles. We then demonstrate that non-Abelian gauge fields can be fully accounted for by the general framework of SLIV, in the limit that the Lorentz violation is small and the SLIV parameter can be treated as a continuous variable. We show that, in this limit, the structure of the non-Abelian gauge field can be fully captured by a small number of parameters related to the SLIV vector field. We also show that the standard representation of the SLIV vector field in the particle physics literature is incomplete, and that a more general representation, which we call the pseudo-Goldstone vector boson representation, is more suitable for the study of SLIV. Our results imply that the non-Abelian structure of the world may be revealed by a more careful study of the spontaneous Lorentz violation effects."}
{"text":"\nWe study the in-medium effects on the production of hadrons and partons in heavy ion collisions at ultra-relativistic energies. We find that the in-medium effects can produce a substantial increase in the number of hadrons, especially in the forward direction. This increase is due to the combined effects of multiple parton interactions and the string-like evolution of the partons in the medium. The increase in the number of hadrons is largest for intermediate values of the number of constituent quarks of the hadrons. The increase in the number of hadrons is accompanied by a decrease in the average kinetic energy of the hadrons. The in-medium effects can also produce a significant suppression of the number of partons, especially in the backward direction. The suppression of the number of partons is largest for small values of the number of constituent quarks of the partons. The in-medium effects can also produce a non-monotonic evolution of the average kinetic energy of the partons. The non-monotonic evolution of the average kinetic energy of the partons is due to the combined effects of multiple parton interactions and the string-like evolution of the partons in the medium."}
{"text":"\nWe propose a new effective conservation of energy and momentum algorithm using switching potentials suitable for molecular dynamics simulation of thermodynamical systems. We show that by using the elastic and inelastic switching potentials, the total energy and momentum can be conserved independently of the details of the simulation method used. This is achieved by using a thermodynamical model with two degrees of freedom q and p, which represent the total energy and the total momentum, respectively, and two additional auxiliary functions, which are related to the inelastic switching. The main advantage of the new algorithm is that it is not necessary to know the exact form of the inelastic switching potential. We show that in the limit of a large number of degrees of freedom, the algorithm is equivalent to the original molecular dynamics simulation. As an example application, we consider a model of a glassy material containing hard and soft particles. We find that the new algorithm is more efficient than the original algorithm in case of a large number of particles and long simulation times."}
{"text":"\nWe construct composite fermion wave functions which are constant in the Conformal Field Theory (CFT) sector of the effective action, and which are related to higher-dimensional representations of the CFT correlation functions. We show that such composite fermions can be used to define an action principle which is invariant under CFT translations, and which leads to invariant theories with a continuous set of effective energies. Within this approach, the bulk dynamics is completely encoded in the CFT sector of the effective action. The bulk action can be obtained by a suitable restrictification of the CFT action, which in general is a non-Abelian Symplectic General Relativistic theory. In the special case of a unitary CFT, the bulk action is the standard General Relativistic action, with a conformal factor which depends on a non-dynamical bulk variable. In this case, the bulk dynamics is completely encoded in the CFT correlation functions. As an application, we consider the theory with the bulk dynamics given by a constant metric tensor, which corresponds to a Conformal Euclidean General Relativity."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a detailed study of the potential of transit surveys in star clusters. We consider the impact of correlated noise and radial velocity follow-up. We show that, despite the presence of correlated noise, transit surveys in star clusters can provide valuable constraints on the frequency and amplitude of transits and on the properties of the planet-hosting stars. We also show that a radial velocity follow-up campaign can further constrain these properties, in particular the mass of the exoplanets. We discuss the practical aspects of a combined transit and radial velocity survey in a star cluster, taking into account the relative photometric and radial velocity precision, the field of view and the observing time. We also consider the detectability of a given planet, given its mass and orbit, as a function of the number and masses of the other planets in the system. We show that the detectability of a given planet is generally larger in a system with many (relatively low-mass) planets than in a system with a few (relatively massive) planets. This has important practical consequences for the design of transit surveys with a wide field of view, such as TESS, as well as for the optimal design of radial velocity follow-up campaigns."}
{"text":"\nWe present a 3D photospheric velocity field of a supergranular cell observed with the Solar Optical Telescope (SOT) on board the Hinode spacecraft. The data set used for this study consists of full-resolution 2D images in different wavelengths ( prominence, photospheric, and magnetogram) obtained during the same observing period. We apply the cross-correlation technique to the photospheric images and retrieve the 3D velocity field of the supergranular cell, which is shown to have a complex velocity structure both at the surface and in the convection zone. We find that the 3D velocity field has large-scale ( tens of kilometers) systematic velocity components in the east-west and north-south directions, which can be explained by the large-scale structure of the supergranular cell. We also find that the supergranular cell has a small-scale ( hundreds of meters) 3D velocity structure, which is related to the small-scale structure of the convection zone. This finding suggests that the supergranular cell has a complex and spatially inhomogeneous velocity structure, which cannot be explained by the simple hydrodynamic model of a cellular convection zone."}
{"text":"\n\nSubstructures in WINGS clusters\n------------------------------\n\nWe present a method for finding substructures in large clusters of galaxies, using the ideas of clique and independent sets in graphs.

We find a strong correlation between the locations of the clusters and the locations of the voids, suggesting that the voids are the most likely places to find the bubbles. We also find a large number of small clusters (consisting of between 10 and 20 galaxies) within the largest clusters, and we show that these small clusters are most likely to be complete subclumps rather than the remains of larger clusters that have been shredded by the largest clusters. The properties of the galaxies that are most likely to be members of the clusters are consistent with the properties of galaxies in the clusters found by other methods, providing confidence that the method is finding the galaxies most likely to be members."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider statistical mechanics models of continuous height effective interfaces in the presence of a delta-pinning at height zero. We show that the depinning transition temperature T_c, as a function of the pinning force F_p, has a minimum in 2 dimensions and 3 dimensions for large heights, in spite of the fact that in higher dimensions the depinning transition temperature is continuous. This result is explained by a careful examination of the slave-hole method used to evaluate T_c. We also show that the 3-d minimum is very shallow and that in higher dimensions it disappears, in spite of the fact that the strength of the delta-pinning is stronger in higher dimensions. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that a continuous height effective interface in 2 dimensions is in a sense \"too weak\" to be stable, in spite of the fact that it is stable in higher dimensions. This has implications for the search for a theory of continuous height effective interfaces and for the understanding of the thermodynamic properties of such interfaces in finite dimensions."}
{"text":"\n\nDust Formation and Survival in Supernova Ejecta\n\nWe present a model of dust formation and evolution in supernova (SN) ejecta, including the effects of radiation and chemical effects. Our model consists of a simple microdynamical description of the dust evolution on the grain size scale and a population balance approach describing the selection and evolution of the grain size distribution. We solve the coupled equations for a spherical shell of uniform density and solve the population balance equation to describe the selection and evolution of the dust size distribution. Our model includes both the inward and outward transport of dust due to these processes, allowing dust to be transported into and out of the SN ejecta. We find that the dust is able to grow efficiently in the early phase of the SN evolution, due to a large amount of gas and a low gas velocity. The dust-to-gas ratio increases quickly and the size distribution evolves towards a power law form. We also find that a significant part of the formed dust is able to survive in the SN ejecta, even after the passage of a million years. The time dependence of the dust survival probability shows a clear signature of the competition between the outward transport due to radiation pressure and the inward transport due to the sedimentation and the gas drag. Our model predictions are compared to observations of SN 1987A and we discuss the observational evidence of dust formation and survival in supernova ejecta."}
{"text":"\n\nWe investigate the evolution of the real estate market in Las Vegas from January 2003 to December 2008, a period that includes the real estate bubble that burst in 2008. We consider three broad questions. First, was the real estate market in Las Vegas adequately modeled by the CCIM (Chicago Center for International Business) model of real estate analysis, which is widely used by real estate professionals in the industry? Second, were there any seasonal patterns in the real estate market that could be exploited to make more accurate predictions? Third, was there any way to predict the turning point of the real estate bubble with technical analysis, and if so, what would be the signs that the bubble was about to burst? Our main results are that the CCIM model does not adequately describe the real estate market in Las Vegas, that there are some seasonal patterns that can be exploited to make more accurate predictions, and that although it is impossible to predict the turning point of the real estate bubble with technical analysis, there are some signs that the bubble was about to burst."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate local-field effects in magneto-dielectric media consisting of a homogeneous dielectric matrix with ferromagnetic inclusions. In the presence of a magnetic field, the inclusion magnetization is oriented along the field direction. If the inclusions are small compared to the wavelength, the medium can be treated as a homogeneous magneto-dielectric medium. We show that in such a medium, a radiative instability can occur, which is analogous to the well-known surface plasmon instability in metal nanostructures. We find that the instability is excited over a narrow frequency range, and it leads to a strong enhancement of the local-field intensity. We show that such an enhancement is accompanied by a significant reduction of the non-radiative dielectric loss, which results in a negative refractive index and negative absorption for the medium. Our findings suggest that magneto-dielectric nanostructures may be promising for developing negative index materials for subwavelength optical tunneling and nanophotonic circuitry."}
{"text":"\nWe present results of a search for colour reconnection in events with two or more jets at LEP-2, using the DELPHI detector. We use the distribution of jet pairs with significant invariant mass, which is sensitive to the strength of the underlying colour field, in events with no charged lepton, to place upper limits on the reconnection rate. The limits are consistent with the expectations from the colour-flavor-locked-in model, in which the only significant reconnection process is between quarkonia and pseudosymmetric particles. The model does not have to be adjusted to fit the data, despite the large variation in the jet masses, the large number of jets produced, and the significant number of events with two jets of the same flavor. We also present a search for events with three or more jets, and find no evidence for significant colour reconnection. We discuss the implications for the quarkonia-pseudosymmetric-dibaryon mechanism of colour reconnection, and for the mechanism of strong colour fields, and present a description of the event selection and the results in the form of tables and figures."}
{"text":"\n\nEvolutionary Neural Gas (ENG): A Model of Self Organizing Network from Input Categorization.\n\nWe present a new model of a self organizing network which is capable of learning an optimal categorization of its inputs. The proposed model, called Evolutionary Neural Gas (ENG), is an extension of the original Neural Gas model, which is capable of learning a general, continuously adjusted structure of clusters. The ENG model is based on the recently proposed Evolutionary Artificial Neural Networks (EANN), which are a generalization of multilayer feedforward ANNs to evolutionary systems. In the ENG, the structure of the network is not predefined but is formed during the learning process. The learning algorithm is based on the survival of the fittest principle, where the structures of the networks are evolved to perform the optimal categorization of the input data. We tested the ENG model on several benchmark datasets, including the standard Iris and Wine Quality datasets. The results show the superiority of the ENG model in the task of input categorization, in comparison to the original Neural Gas model and several other competitive models."}
{"text":"\nWe consider the high energy evolution equation including running coupling corrections. Performing a regularization procedure, we obtain a kinetic evolution equation for the coupling constant. The new evolution kernel contains a discrete derivative which is related to the higher-order corrections to the evolution kernel. Performing an expansion in the coupling constant we are able to separate the kernel into an infinite sum of kernels, each containing a discrete derivative. Performing an approximation procedure we are able to calculate the higher-order corrections to the evolution kernel. We consider the simplest case of a scalar theory with a Lagrangian without any additional terms and find the leading behavior of the evolution kernel and the higher-order corrections. We find that the higher-order corrections have a small impact on the evolution kernel and in general do not change the shape of the evolution kernel. We discuss the implications of our result for the case of a theory with a non-trivial Lagrangian and for the case of a theory with higher-order corrections which are not related to the evolution kernel. We find that in both cases the evolution kernel is changed in a non-trivial way."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a millimeter-wave imaging survey of the disk around the young star HD 163296, a member of the Leo constellation. Our data set comprises 16 image slices, each of which was imaged at 6.0 GHz and 7.0 GHz with a 7-mm-diameter telescope at the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory on Mauna Kea. We show that these data can be combined to obtain a resolved map of the disk's inner region, with a spatial resolution of 30 AU at a wavelength of 6.0 GHz. The map reveals the disk's spoke-wheel structure, including the spokes and the gaps between them. We determine the position and brightness of the disk's inner rim, which marks the transition between the spoke-wheel structure and the smoothly rotating inner disk. We measure the radial velocity of the disk's outer rim, which has a displacement of 4.4 \u00b1 0.1 milliarcseconds across the six visible spokes. This displacement is consistent with the expected velocity of the outer rim, as determined from the observed orbital elements of the spoke-driver stars. We conclude that the kinematics of the disk's outer rim is not influenced by the spoke-wheel structure."}

We present here the results of a spectropolarimetric observations of the Ca II 8498 A and 8542 A lines in the non-magnetic photosphere of the quiet Sun, made with the 1.5-m reflector telescope at the Sonnblick Observatory. We aim at characterizing the statistical properties of the linear polarization signal in these lines, with particular attention to the decorrelation timescales, and the relative importance of the Hanle and Zeeman effects. Our data are consistent with a model in which the photospheric grains are thermally and optically homogeneous, and the Hanle effect is dominant. We find that the decorrelation timescale of the polarimetric signal is $\\sim5$ minutes. The magnetic field is found to be neither parallel nor perpendicular to the line-of-sight, but at an angle of about 45 degrees, in agreement with previous observations. Our results are consistent with a Hanle- dominated polarization process, where the dipole moment of the grains is parallel to the magnetic field. We discuss the implications of our results for the structure of the photospheric grains, and for the theory of the Hanle effect."}

The method is tested on the LHC pp collisions at \\sqrt{s}=8 TeV, using a sample of events with b-jet and missing ets. We find 2 events in the signal region, compared to an expectation of 1.3+-0.7 events, corresponding to a significance of 2.1 standard deviations above the background. The observed cross section times the branching fraction is 2.5+-0.8 times the standard model prediction for a Higgs boson with a mass of 100 GeV\/c^2, assuming that the Higgs boson is produced in association with a Z-boson and the Z-boson decays to neutrinos.

{"text":"\n\nWe consider statistical properties of step-edge fluctuations in electric fields applied to metal surfaces. We show that a non-Gaussian process, similar to the random telegraph signal, can be used to describe the temporal evolution of the step-edge intensity. Our results suggest that the non-Gaussian process is driven by the local evolution of the surface structure, which results in a self-organized critical behavior of the step-edge fluctuations. The theoretical framework developed in this work allows a description of the effect of the applied field on the dynamic properties of the surface roughness in terms of the drift velocity of the atomic diffusion process and the length of the diffusion path. We show that the non-Gaussian feature of the step-edge fluctuation is related to the competition between the different diffusive paths in the applied field. Our model is consistent with the assumption that the critical behavior of the step-edge fluctuations is self-organized by the internal dynamics of the diffusion process, and it does not require any additional mechanisms, such as external noise or temperature variations."}
{"text":"\nWe propose a new method to probe dark energy by correlating local galaxy density and local galaxy morphology measures extracted from the WMAP and NVSS surveys, respectively. Our method is based on the use of steerable wavelets, which enable us to optimally extract the relevant information from the two surveys. We show that our procedure is sensitive to the dark energy density in a manner that is independent of the specific choice of galaxy density and morphology measures. We find that the cross-correlation function of our optimally extracted density and morphology measures peaks at a dark energy density of omega_0 = -1.01 +\/- 0.06 (h = 150 Mpc), in good agreement with the value extracted from the cosmic microwave background anisotropy. Our confidence level is better than 5sigma. We show that our procedure is sensitive to local variations of the dark energy density in a manner that is consistent with a Taylor-scale expansion of the Universe. We also show that our procedure is largely insensitive to the specific choice of galaxy density and morphology measures, as long as they are extracted with the use of steerable wavelets. We discuss the implications of our findings for future research."}

In a system with many planets, the method can also be used to estimate the masses of the planets. We present an analysis of the transit timing of the exoplanet system Kepler-36. We find that the masses of the two largest planets can be estimated to within a factor of 2, provided that the orbits are known to within 2%. We present a simple method to derive the orbits, which relies on the measurement of only two transits for a system containing three or more planets. For the Kepler-36 system, we show that this method is sufficiently precise to derive the masses of the two largest planets. We show that transit timing can be used to detect multi-planetary systems, and to estimate the masses of the planets therein."}
{"text":"\nA Finite Element framework for computation of protein normal modes and mechanical response.\n\nWe present a Finite Element framework for computation of protein normal modes and mechanical response. The method is based on a novel combination of three elements: (i) A streamlined implementation of the FEM, (ii) A new method for the computation of the underlying atomistic system stiffness matrix, and (iii) An efficient procedure for the identification of the lowest eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the stiffness matrix. We demonstrate the performance of the method on a number of benchmark systems, and show that the method is both robust and accurate. The method has a number of attractive features, including (i) the possibility to deal with large systems, (ii) the use of a minimal number of parameters, (iii) a straightforward interpretation of the results, (iv) a simple implementation, (v) the possibility of using any kind of boundary conditions, and (vi) a natural way to deal with heterogeneity."}
{"text":"\nWe present two-dimensional computer simulations of lattices of Fermi particles with a repulsive contact interaction and a range of temperatures T. We show that the spacing between the particles is directly proportional to the inverse square root of T, independent of the details of the interaction. We then consider a spatially periodic lattice and show that this result is equivalent to the spacing between the particles being inversely proportional to the spatial period of the lattice. We show that this conclusion can be guaranteed by a simple inequality, which we call the spatial resolution theorem. The condition that the particles be distinguishable at the lattice spacing implies that the spatial resolution theorem is guaranteed for lattices of distinguishable particles, independent of the details of the interaction. We consider the case of a repulsive interaction between adjacent particles and show that this condition is satisfied if the potential is at least as large as the thermal energy kBT, so that the particles are distinguishable at the lattice spacing for all temperatures. We then show that the spatial resolution theorem implies that the particles are tightly packed at low temperatures, and that the density of particles is inversely proportional to the temperature. We show that this conclusion can be guaranteed by an inequality, which we call the background independence theorem. We then consider the case of a lattice with a large but finite number of particles, and show that the background independence theorem implies that the number of particles is inversely proportional to the temperature."}

We present the results of a narrow band imaging survey for galaxies in the first year of the Universe. Our survey uses narrow band filters, in the range of $8 - 10 \\AA, and a 3'x3' field of view to search for galaxies in the first hundred million years of the Universe. We find three galaxies in our survey that are candidate galaxies from this era. We determine the redshift of these galaxies to be between $z=8.6 - 10.4$. These galaxies are found in a region of the sky that is richest in the intergalactic hydrogen gas that was the target of the Hubble Deep Field survey. Our galaxies are much fainter than the galaxies found by Hubble, which are at redshifts of $z \\sim 1.5$. This implies that galaxies were still forming in relatively chemically pristine sites at these high redshifts. We discuss the implications of these galaxies on the epoch of reionization and the future of the Universe."}

{"text":"\n\nBehavioural response to strong aversive stimuli: A neurodynamical model\nAversion is an essential phenomenon that helps organisms to avoid harmful events. The avoidance of aversive events is typically quick and does not require conscious processing. A recent model of avoidance behaviour, the Return On Investment (ROI) model, suggests that decisions to avoid can be based on predictions of the total aversive value of an expected event, including the magnitude and duration of the event. We propose a neurodynamical model based on spiking neurons that is consistent with the ROI model. We show that a network of spiking neurons with Hebbian synapses can learn to avoid aversive stimuli by modifying the synaptic strength of assemblies of neurons that represent different aspects of aversive events. The strength of these synapses is based on the relative spike times of the two sets of neurons. We show that this model can learn to avoid aversive stimuli with different structures, as well as to postpone avoidance when the aversive stimulus is strong. Our results suggest that a distributed network of neurons with synapses that are modified based on spike times can learn to avoid aversive stimuli with different structures."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present an analysis of the stellar content of galaxies in the high redshift Universe, based on a sample of galaxies selected from the Ultra Deep Survey. We find that the stellar populations of galaxies in the redshift range z < 1 have typical metallicities [Fe\/H] > +0.5, whereas galaxies at higher redshift (z >> 1) have metallicities that are a factor of ~2 lower. This difference is interpreted as the effect of a 'galactic wind' that has been removing metals from galaxies in the high redshift Universe. We derive an empirical relation between the stellar metallicity and the galaxies' stellar mass, which we use to infer the metallicities of galaxies at very high redshift (z >> 5), where no useful photometric metallicities can be obtained. We find that these galaxies also show the tell-tale sign of a strong metal-poor population, suggesting that galaxies in the early Universe were much more efficient at removing metals than galaxies in the local Universe. We discuss the implications of our findings for the theory of galaxy formation and evolution."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a catalogue of 75 high redshift damped Lyman-alpha galaxies (DLAs) observed with integral field spectroscopy on the Hubble Space Telescope. These galaxies were selected from an image-based catalogue of over 250 DLA candidates found in an Hubble Ultra-Deep Field survey for bright galaxies with strong ultraviolet ionization continuum sources. Our integral field spectroscopy confirmed that all of our galaxies are at high redshift (z < 1), and revealed the redshifts and optical line-of-sight velocities for each galaxy. We find that the mean redshift of our sample is 0.86 (0.78 - 0.92), and the mean line-of-sight velocity is -69 km\/s (68 - -74 km\/s). Using the updated distance measurements from the Hubble Deep Field Survey, we find that the DLA galaxies lie at mean distances of 80 - 200 Mpc. Our high redshift DLAs are found to be relatively rich in neutral hydrogen gas (10 - 25 per cent of the critical density for reionization), and are possibly the galaxies responsible for the reionization of the Universe. We discuss our galaxies in the context of other high redshift DLAs, and in terms of galaxy formation and evolution."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present an analysis of the evolution of the sky brightness distribution as a function of galaxy redshift, based on the SDSS image data. We find that the distribution is very well described by a two-parameter power law with a scale factor that increases with redshift and a power law index that decreases with redshift. The result implies that the fraction of the sky occupied by galaxies increases with redshift, while the mean surface brightness decreases. We show that this evolution can be understood within the framework of a simple model in which the galaxies are assumed to be distributed according to a Gaussian random field with a variance that increases with redshift. In this model the power law index of the sky brightness distribution is related to the variance of the random field. The main advantage of the model is that it provides a simple physical interpretation of the shape of the sky brightness distribution as a function of redshift. In particular, it explains why the distribution becomes shallower with increasing redshift. The model also predicts that the standard deviation of the distribution should increase with redshift, in agreement with previous results based on the analysis of the 2 Micron All Sky Survey data."}
{"text":"\nWe present a new model of the boundary conditions of the heliosphere based on a statistical equilibrium model of the ionosphere with an expanded boundary to encompass the whole heliosphere. We use this model to investigate the impact of the varying boundary conditions that arise from different theories of the solar wind, the magnetosphere, and the ionosphere. We find that the models in which the ionosphere is driven by a constant electric field, regardless of whether that field is imposed from the inside or the outside of the heliosphere, produce the best fit to the observations. The models in which the ionosphere is driven by a varying electric field, on the other hand, produce a much worse fit, regardless of whether the field is imposed from the inside or the outside. This suggests that a model in which the ionosphere is driven by a constant electric field is preferred to a model in which the ionosphere is driven by a varying electric field. We also find that the ionospheric model with the lowest variability of the ionospheric parameters produces the best fit to the observations. This suggests that a model in which the ionosphere is driven by a constant electric field is preferred to a model in which the ionosphere is driven by a varying electric field.

We show that the observed distribution in burst durations, ifcorrectly correlated with the distribution in the progenitor's lifetime, is consistent with there being no lower limit to the lifetime of a progenitor. We also show that a model in which the progenitor is a binary system, in which the orbital decay of the secondary is due to the transfer of energy from the primary, is consistent with the observed distribution in burst durations. This model is consistent with a burst duration distribution that has a cutoff, which we estimate to be between 2 and 4 ks, as well as a tail that extends to burst durations as long as 25 ks.

{"text":"\nWe study the electronic behavior and localization in stretched dry DNA. We consider the DNA as a quantum wire with a diameter of the order of the de Broglie wavelength of the electrons. We develop a multiscale model, which combines a Schr\u00f6dinger-like description for the electronic wave propagation along the DNA and a Markovian description for the local spatial fluctuations of the electronic density. The model is based on the assumption that the electronic wave travels along the DNA without significant spatial spreading, that is, it does not significantly overlap with its own evanescent field. The nonlocality of quantum transport is incorporated in our model by a nonlocal drove, which is responsible for the electronic transport along the DNA. We obtain a good agreement between our model prediction and available experimental data. In particular, our model explains why the conductance along the DNA shows a strong temperature dependence, but its local spatial fluctuations are weakly temperature dependent."}
{"text":"\nWe study the production of J\/psi mesons in an equilibrating partonic system with the help of a particle-to-hole conversion model. The basic assumption of the model is that the partonic system can be represented by a one-particle picture and that the massless quarkonia are produced by a  radial-node conversion mechanism. The model has several parameters that can be adjusted to fit the data. The most important one is the ratio of the momentum transfer to the kinetic energy, which is related to the phase transition between the hadronization and the equilibration stages. The other parameters include the magnitude of the P-factor and the annihilation cross section of the quarkonia. By fitting the model to the data of J\/psi meson production in  ultraperipheral collisions of  heavy ions we find that the parameter values are consistent with the model prediction that the equilibrating partonic system is mainly composed of a single (on-shell) parton and that the annihilation of quarkonia is a  very fast process."}
{"text":"\n\nIntroduction:\nIn this work we consider the Hamiltonian formalism in Friedmann cosmology and its quantization. We start with a brief review of the Hamiltonian formalism in general, and then we continue with the Hamiltonian formalism in Friedmann cosmology. We derive the Hamiltonian equations in this context and we solve them analytically. The solutions of the homogeneous and isotropic model are the same as the solutions of the Newtonian theory. The non-homogeneous and anisotropic case is more complicated. In this case the solution has two degrees of freedom, which we call \"cosmological constant\" and \"effective density\". We show that the possible values of these two degrees of freedom are restricted by the condition that the total energy is constant. In addition, we show that the solutions of the non-homogeneous and anisotropic case are singular. Finally, we discuss the quantization of the Hamiltonian system. We show that the quantization is equivalent to the quantization of the energy. We also show that the energy is quantized in a discrete set of values. The correspondence between the values of the energy and the values of the cosmological constant and the effective density is also discussed."}
{"text":"\nWe consider the problem of information transmission via suprathreshold stochastic resonance (SSR) in a network of coupled oscillators. The oscillators are characterized by a symmetrically distributed resonance threshold and the coupling strength is such that the symmetric limit of the network is an Ising model. We show that, in spite of the non-uniform distribution of the threshold levels, the optimal choice of the signal and noise distributions results in a symmetric resonance, and that this symmetric resonance achieves the same information transmission performance as a Lorentzian resonance in a uniformly thresholded Ising model. We also show that the choice of the noise distribution has a crucial effect on the information transmission performance, and that the optimal noise distribution is not the same as the optimal signal distribution. Finally, we show that the threshold distribution can be chosen in order to either improve or deteriorate the information transmission performance, compared to the case with a uniformly distributed threshold."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present three different methods to assess the dependence of galaxy properties on their alignment within dark matter halos.

In contrast, we find that the distribution of galaxies in the Local Void is in disagreement with the numerical simulations, possibly hinting at a preference for an anti-aligned galaxy distribution. We also find that the distribution of galaxies in the Local Sheet is in agreement with the alignment along the sheet predicted by numerical simulations, but in disagreement with a preference for an anti-aligned galaxy distribution. We discuss our results in the context of recent numerical simulations, and compare the dependence of the results on the choice of the distance and galaxy redshift cut-offs used to select the galaxy sample."}
{"text":"\n\nA very massive runaway star from Cygnus OB2\n\nWe present observations of a very massive runaway star from Cygnus OB2. The star was observed in 2015 with the Gaia space telescope and was found to have a proper motion of about 1.7 arcseconds per year, which is unusually high for a star in the local molecular cloud. Follow-up observations with the Hubble space telescope have shown that the star is moving away from the molecular cloud at a velocity of about 20 km\/s. We estimate that the star must have had a mass of about 20 M\u2299 when it was born, and it has now lost about 5 M\u2299 due to its runaway motion. This is the most massive runaway star observed so far. The high velocity of the star means that it has a large peculiar motion with respect to the local standard of rest. We show that this peculiar motion is likely to be due to the influence of the global molecular cloud. The massive runaway star could have originated in the Cygnus OB2 association, but it is now moving out of the association and will soon be unaffiliated. \n\nThe motivation for the research was to study massive runaway stars in order to better understand the process of massive star formation. The key ideas and methodology used were to observe the proper motion of a large sample of massive stars in the Cygnus OB2 association, and to determine the kinematic properties of those stars. The results obtained were that one of the stars in the sample had a very high proper motion, indicating that it was a runaway star. The problem that this work attempts to solve is the question of how massive stars are formed and how they evolve. The practical application of this work is that it helps us to understand the origin and evolution of massive stars, which are the most massive objects in the universe and have a profound influence on the evolution of the universe. The theoretical application of this work is that it provides new data that can be used to test theories of massive star formation and evolution."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present an analysis of the spatial distribution of the 43 GHz and 86 GHz SiO maser lines in the oxygen-rich evolved star R Leo. Our data confirm the presence of a maser spot, which we associate with a spatial accumulation of SiO, likely in a region of high density. We show that this spot is stable on timescales of years, as it must be to explain previous observations, but that its location is not fixed with respect to the stellar position, as has been suggested. Instead, it precesses around the star with a timescale that is roughly two orders of magnitude longer than the orbital period. We derive a simple model in which this precession is caused by the gravitational influence of a massive companion, and we use this model to constrain the masses of the two stars to be 1.95 $M_{\\odot}$ and 1.1 $M_{\\odot}$. This is consistent with the known masses of the main star and its companion, but we have no evidence that this is the correct model: other explanations, such as a migrating spot or a bipolar configuration, are also consistent with the data. We have also measured for the first time the 43 GHz maser line in the companion, but detected no significant emission at 86 GHz."}
{"text":"\nWe study the excitations of a classical gas of hard disks moving in a box. We find a simple relationship between the structure of the collisions and the energy spectrum of the gas. Two different regimes are identified: a \"hard\" regime, where the energy is conserved in the collisions, and a \"fuzzy\" regime, where the disks can exchange energy. The transition between the two regimes is sharp, and is controlled by a single parameter, the ratio between the kinetic energy and the thermal energy. We show that this transition is generic, in the sense that it occurs for any set of hard disks with a given repulsive interaction, regardless of the details of the collision dynamics. Within the fuzzy regime, the energy spectrum is characterized by a cutoff wavelength, which depends on the energy per disk, and on the density of the gas. We evaluate the static and the dynamic properties of the gas, in both regimes. In particular, we find that the static structure factor is very well described by a simple functional form in the whole range of density, while the dynamic structure factor shows a strong singularity at the transition density, and then remains nearly constant for large densities. Our results are consistent with a model where the dynamics is described by hard disks collisions, with a repulsion that increases with the distance, and where the energy is conserved in the collisions. The dynamics of this model is exact, and can be exactly solved. We discuss the relevance of our results for disordered systems with long-range interactions, and for the problem of ordered structures formation."}

This extra quark generation is related to the multi Froggatt-Nielsen fields. We show that the standard model dynamics is in fact the low energy dynamics of this unified model, and that the multi Froggatt-Nielsen fields can be introduced as a solution to the problem of dynamically generating the weak and strong symmetries in a unified model.

{"text":"\n\nWe consider a piston that is subject to adiabatic forces and performs oscillatory motions in a periodically changing environment. We study the problem of finding the piston's displacement as a function of time and the pressure in the reservoir as a function of the piston's position, both in the case of a stationary piston and in the case of a moving piston. The problem is formulated as a system of two ordinary differential equations, one for each variable. For the stationary piston the system is analyzed using the Laplace transform method, and rigorous results are obtained for the limiting cases of small and large amplitude of the piston's oscillations. These results are consistent with the thermodynamics of ideal gases and can be used to analyze real gases in the case of small amplitudes. For the moving piston we obtain an integral representation for the solution, which is exact for arbitrary amplitude. The method of obtaining this result is rather involved and consists of two parts. First, an integral representation for the solution of the stationary piston problem is obtained; this representation is exact for arbitrary amplitude and is used to find the solution of the moving piston problem. In the second part the original system is simplified by using the Wronskian technique and an approximation is obtained which is valid for small piston velocities."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a detailed kinetic study of the ring opening of cycloalkanes by CBS-QB3 calculations. The motivation for the work was the significant discrepancy between the experimentally observed reaction pathways and the paths predicted by QST2, the most widely used method for describing non-bonded interactions. Our key ideas and methodology were to carefully examine the effects of four factors that have been proposed to affect the ring opening process: (1) the ring strain, (2) the aliphatic carbon chain length, (3) the number of carbon atoms in the largest ring, and (4) the position of the ring-opening event. Our results obtained from CBS-QB3 calculations show that these four factors do not have a major effect on the ring-opening process. We also discuss the reasons why QST2 may have failed to describe the reaction pathway.

{"text":"\n\nWe study the transient behavior of surface plasmon polaritons scattered at a subwavelength groove. We show that the transmission coefficient of a surface plasmon wave scattered at a groove depends on the excitation frequency, the groove width, and the angle of incidence, and it exhibits several interesting features such as a peak or a dip at the resonance frequency. We explain these phenomena by analytically solving the scattering problem for a groove with a rectangular cross-section. Our analytical results are in good agreement with the numerical results obtained by solving the three-dimensional Maxwell equations. We also numerically investigate the scattering from a V-shaped groove, which can be realized by etching a shallow V-shaped trench in a thin gold film.

{"text":"\n\nWe investigate the possibility of detecting gravitational waves from a chaotic system consisting of a point mass M moving in a planar orbit around a rotating disk. We show that the presence of a quadrupole mode in the gravitational field of the system is guaranteed by the principles of general relativity, provided that the orbit of the point mass is sufficiently close to the equatorial plane of the disk. We evaluate the frequency spectrum of the quadrupole mode and show that it is possible to detect it by laser interferometry. We discuss the problem of extracting the signal from the noise background, due to the chaotic nature of the system, and evaluate the effect of measurement errors on the detectability of the signal. Our analysis shows that it is possible to detect the quadrupole mode from a chaotic system with a relatively small number of detectors, provided that the noise level is sufficiently low.

{"text":"\n\nWe present observations of the Seyfert galaxy NGC 3783 obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) to study the kinematics of the broad line region (BLR). We find that the kinematics of the BLR in NGC 3783 is characterized by a large random component, in strong contrast to the ordered motion seen in the inner 30 percent of the BLR in the nearby Seyfert galaxy NGC 4151. We show that this random motion is consistent with the superposition of small-scale velocity fluctuations, and that a large-scale dynamic structure is absent. Our results suggest that the accretion in NGC 3783 may be governed by a distribution of molecular clouds along the line of sight, in strong contrast to the single-cloud accretion model assumed in most current theories of Seyfert galaxies. We discuss several possible explanations for the origin of the random kinematics in NGC 3783 and present high-resolution observations of the ionization structure in the BLR. These data show that the ionized gas in the BLR is not rotating and is not trapped by a strong dynamic field, supporting the idea that the accretion in NGC 3783 is not driven by a single cloud but by the superposition of many small clouds."}

As a result, a regular and very general energy density functional is obtained, which can be viewed as a generalization of the Skyrme functional to the case of spherical nuclei. The parameters of this functional are related to the well-known Skyrme parameters. The corresponding Hamiltonian is given in the form of a sum of contributions from Skyrme interactions and a tensor interaction, which is a generalization of the Gauss-Bonnet interaction to the spherical case. The properties of this functional are investigated by means of the nudged-chain method. The resulting properties of spherical nuclei are consistent with the properties of the Skyrme functional and, in addition, some new properties appear, which are related to the properties of the tensor interaction."}

We find 9 quasars with mid-IR luminosities of $L_{\\rm Spitzer} \\sim 10^{36}$ $\\rm erg s^{-1}$, which corresponds to $L_{\\rm bol} \\sim 10^{42}$ $\\rm erg s^{-1}$ in the rest frame. We find that the bolometric luminosity distribution of these quasars is well described by a power law with a decay index of $-1.35 \\pm 0.06$. This is consistent with a simple model in which the quasars are powered by accretion onto a black hole, with the energy distribution given by the accretion disc temperature, and is in strong tension with the simple ram pressure model. We discuss this in the framework of the existing simple models for quasars, and suggest that this tension may be resolved by a model in which the accretion disc is not isothermal, but rather has a structure that is hydrodynamically stable. We show that such a model is consistent with the available data, and that it predicts a strong correlation between the accretion disc mass and the accretion rate, in tension with the correlation found in the simple isothermal model. We suggest that this correlation may be used to discriminate between the two models."}
{"text":"\n\nQuantifying social group evolution\n\nWe are motivated by the question of how the structure of social groups changes over time. We consider a setting with two types of social groups: cliques and stars. A clique is a group of people who are all friends with each other, while a star is a group of one person and his or her N friends, where N > 2. We assume that groups are relatively stable and that the number of groups is small. Given a set of group memberships over time, our goal is to detect the changes in group structure that have occurred. We focus on the following two questions: (1) What is the rate of change of the number of groups and the number of people per group? (2) What is the rate of change of the number of cliques and the number of stars? We present a technique for quantifying the rates of change in the number of groups and the number of people per group. We show that the number of cliques decreases with a rate that is proportional to the number of cliques that exist at the previous time step. We also show that the number of stars increases with a rate that is proportional to the number of stars that exist at the previous time step. These results provide a simple way to quantify the evolution of social group structure."}
{"text":"\n\nWe propose and analyze a scheme to entangle independent photons which does not require light to propagate between the entangled photons. This is in contrast to previous entanglement generation schemes which require some form of light propagation (including nonlinear interactions, emission from a spontaneous parametric down-convention, or transmission through a diffuser or similar scramble element). Our scheme relies on a precise time measurement of the arrival of the photons at a detector. We show that this can be achieved by a combination of a narrow-band filter and a picosecond voltage pulse applied to a fast photodiode. In order to entangle two photons which are not in causal contact, we propose to use two different narrow-band filters with slightly overlapping spectra. The time windows of the two detectors are then synchronized by a control signal, which also serves to trigger the emission of the photons. We analyze the scheme and particularize it to various experimental realizations."}
{"text":"\n\nLocal de Broglie-Bohm Trajectories from Entangled Wavefunctions\n\nWe present a technique for extracting local de Broglie-Bohm trajectories for a single electron in a singlet state, from the wavefunction alone. Our approach is to consider the effects of a magnetic field on the wavefunction, and to examine the evolution of the associated likelihood distribution. We show that in a given region of space, the probability of finding the electron at a particular location depends only on the value of the wavefunction at that location, and not on the way the electron arrived there. This leads to a local interpretation of the de Broglie-Bohm trajectories, in terms of a Gradually Amplified Disturbance in the wavefunction, with a new and simple expression for the associated probability distribution. The method is exact, and has no practical limits to the spatial resolution, unlike other techniques based on the determination of an individual's wavefunction. The approach is illustrated with a numerical example."}
{"text":"\n\nGround-based Microlensing Surveys\n\nWe present the results of a comprehensive statistical study of all the ground-based microlensing observations carried out to date. These surveys have been conducted with a variety of instruments, targeting several different populations of galaxies, and with observation times ranging from several weeks to more than a year. We find that, despite these differences, the surveys are consistent with each other and with our predictions, based on a simple model of the microlensing process. We show that the typical magnifications observed are consistent with a single population of lenses, located at a median distance of $\\sim 12.5 kpc$. The distribution of lens masses is consistent with a power law with a turnover (conventionally defined as a change in slope) at $M_{\\rm lens} \\sim 10^{11} M_{\\odot}$. We show that the number density of lenses per unit volume is $\\sim 2.4 \\times 10^{-4} M_{\\odot}$. This is consistent with the assumption that lenses are located within the volume-filling median density, $\\sim 10^{-4} M_{\\odot}$. The magnification distribution has a long tail, and we show that this is consistent with a small number of very high magnification events, as expected from a single population of lenses. The mean magnification is $\\sim 2.1$, consistent with a lens mass of $M_{\\rm lens} \\sim 10^{11} M_{\\odot}$. We conclude that the ground-based microlensing surveys, taken together, have provided a useful constraint on the number density of massive lensing galaxies."}
{"text":"\n\nThe luminous infrared composite Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 7679 through the [O III] 5007 emission line\nWe present deep ([O III] 5007 luminosity: 8.2 kpc^2) imaging of the luminous infrared Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 7679 in the [O III] 5007 luminosity range (0.7-1.3 kpc^2) in order to search for the circumgalactic medium (CGM). We find that the ionization structure in the CGM is extremely complex. There are at least three ionization structures in the CGM: one is a smoothly ionized region around the galaxy, another is a patchy ionized region, and the third is a region with a number of ionized knots. We also present a simple model to explain the ionization structure in the CGM. Our model can reproduce the [O III] luminosity distribution in the CGM. According to our model, the ionized regions in the CGM are due to the infall of the low ionization gas from the outer region, and the patchy ionized region is due to the infall of the medium ionized gas from the inner region. Our model also predicts that the ionized regions in the CGM will be close to the galactic plane, which is consistent with our observations."}
{"text":"\n\nWe study the co-evolution of intra-day stock price movements and their collective behavior in an emerging market, using a high-frequency intra-day data set of the National Stock Exchange (NSE) of India. We find that the price evolution is well described by a model where the microstructure noise is filtered by a long memory process. The empirical estimation of the dynamic conditional correlations shows that the market is integrated in the short run but becomes fractionally integrated in the long run. Our results suggest that market is gradually becoming more efficient in the intra-day time frame, but the long run behavior is similar to a random walk. We also find that the time variation in the conditional correlations is best described by a stochastic process. The persistence in the intra-day correlations is also found to be very low. A significant correlation between the intra-day price movement and the volume traded is observed. Our results suggest that the volume traded is a significant driver of the intra-day price movement. We find that the effects of several market sentiment indicators, such as BSE\/NSE index level, traded value and trading volume on the next day price movement are negative. These findings are consistent with the view that market is in an efficiency-seeking equilibrium.\n\nWe would like to thankTwo REUs, Benjamin Brown and Laura Schaefer, for excellent research assistance.

{"text":"\n\nWe present a morphological study of galaxies in the A901\/902 supercluster from the COMBO-17 survey. A total of 570 galaxies with photometric redshifts in the range 0.155 < z_phot < 1.046 are visually classified by three independent classifiers to M_V=-18. These morphological classifications are compared to local galaxy density, distance from the nearest cluster centre, local surface brightness and photometric classification. At high local galaxy densities, log(Sigma_10 \/ Mpc^2) > 1.5, a classical morphology-density relation is found. A correlation is also found between morphology and local surface brightness, with the log(Sigma_10 \/ arcsec^2) > 1.5 relation previously found in the local group. A correlation is found between morphology and distance from the nearest cluster, with a clear tendency for galaxies to be more irregular close to a cluster. A similar correlation is found for photometric classification, with a tendency for galaxies to be more irregular or late-type galaxies close to a cluster. We also find a morphological difference between galaxies in the A901\/902 supercluster and in the local group: in the local group, late-type galaxies are more common in high-density environments, while in the A901\/902 supercluster the trend is reversed, with irregular galaxies being more common in high-density environments. We discuss these results in the context of recent theoretical models."}
{"text":"\n\nWe give a survey of the recent progress in the theory of Frobenius splitting and geometry of $G$-Schubert varieties. The basic motivation for the research is to understand the geometry of the Grassmannian and the Grassmannian's relation to other important varieties. The starting point is the description of the Grassmannian as the solution set of a polynomial equation in the cosets of a subgroup of $G = \\operatorname{SL}(V)$ acting on a finite dimensional vector space $V$. One key idea is the use of the Grassmannian as a geometric model for the study of more general geometrically defined classes of varieties. A second key idea is the use of the geometry of the Grassmannian to produce linear algebraic methods for the study of other geometrically defined classes of varieties. A third key idea is the use of the geometry of the Grassmannian to produce geometrically defined classes of varieties which are not obviously linear algebraically defined. We discuss the results obtained, the problems which remain open, and the future directions of this research."}
{"text":"\nWe study the effectiveness of boundary treatments for the Einstein equations. In particular, we consider the effects of placing an impenetrable boundary, a boundary with a cosine profile, and a penetrable boundary on the solutions to the Einstein equations for a Schwarzschild black hole and a Kerr black hole, respectively. We find that, in contrast to the traditional view, the choice of the outer boundary treatment does not have any significant effect on the shape of the inner horizon, but it does affect the shape of the outer horizon. For the Schwarzschild black hole, we show that a boundary with a cosine profile is effective in producing a spherical outer horizon, whereas an impenetrable boundary is not. For the Kerr black hole, we show that a boundary with a cosine profile is again effective in producing a spherical outer horizon, but a penetrable boundary is effective only if the boundary is very close to the black hole. We also study the energy evolution of the black holes and find that the energy evolution is affected by the outer boundary treatment. For the Schwarzschild black hole, the energy evolution is the same for all the outer boundary treatments considered. For the Kerr black hole, however, the energy evolution depends on the outer boundary treatment. In particular, we show that the energy of the Kerr black hole monotonically decreases in time if the outer boundary is penetrable, but it does not decrease monotonically if the outer boundary is either impenetrable or with a cosine profile. We also show that the energy of the Kerr black hole is strictly decreasing if the outer boundary is with a cosine profile but not strictly decreasing if the outer boundary is impenetrable or penetrable."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present 22 new close binary systems observed with the SDSS-I (Data Release Five). These systems consist of 11 detached binaries, 5 semidetached binaries, and 6 white dwarfs with a close companion.

In addition, we present our new catalog of 2,000 magnetic white dwarfs observed with the SDSS-I, and we determine the fraction of magnetic white dwarfs in close binary systems. We show that the fraction of magnetic white dwarfs in close binary systems is significantly higher than the fraction of magnetic white dwarfs in the general population of white dwarfs. We discuss this result in the framework of the evolution of close binary systems. We also present a comparison of the observed properties of magnetic white dwarfs in close binary systems with the properties of magnetic white dwarfs in the general population of white dwarfs. We show that magnetic white dwarfs in close binary systems tend to have lower magnetic field strengths, lower masses, and higher temperatures than magnetic white dwarfs in the general population. We discuss these results in the framework of the evolution of magnetic white dwarfs in close binary systems and the properties of the progenitor stars of these systems."}
{"text":"\n\nSpectral analysis of Swift long GRBs with known redshift\n\nWe present spectral analysis of all Swift long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) with known redshift in order to study the evolution of their spectral and energetics properties as a function of redshift. We find a clear segregation of the samples in two distinct groups according to their redshift, with the high-redshift bursts (z > 1) presenting harder and more energetic spectra than the low-redshift bursts (z < 1). We show this difference cannot be explained by a simple evolution of the burst parameters (energy fluence, peak energy and isotropic-equivalent radiated energy) as a function of redshift, suggesting an additional, poorly understood, evolution of the spectral properties. We find a good agreement of our results with a model in which the high-redshift bursts are produced in an extra-galactic medium, with the low-redshift bursts produced in a galactic medium. This model is in good agreement with the observed distribution of burst redshift, with the known extragalactic burst population, and with the galactic observations of the burst birth-sites. We discuss our results in the framework of the current theories of GRB production and evolution."}
{"text":"\nWe present a statistical study of the relationship between molecular gas tracers and Kennicutt-Schmidt laws in galaxies. Our goal is to better understand the physical mechanisms that drive galaxy evolution. We have developed a new method to extract the molecular gas content in galaxies from the observed H\u03b1 and H\u03b2 luminosities using the Kennicutt-Schmidt laws. Our method uses an expanded version of the Galaxy Kindert\u00e2\u20ac\u0093Fr \u00c3\u0083pgen relation that includes the galaxy's systemic angular momentum, relative central surface brightness, and anamorphic ratio. We find that the molecular gas content of galaxies is well described by a simple linear relation in terms of these global galaxy properties. We also find that the scatter in the molecular gas content around the relation is consistent with the predictions of the Ambulance-Governano-Giazzi model for the distribution of molecular gas in galaxies. The excellent agreement between the predictions of the model and the observations suggests that the Ambulance-Governano-Giazzi model is a good representation of the physical processes that regulate the distribution of molecular gas in galaxies. We discuss our results in the framework of the competitive accretion theory of galaxy formation."}
{"text":"\n\nWe study heavy-light semileptonic decays in the framework of staggered chiral perturbation theory (SCPT). We evaluate the non-relativistic heavy-light semileptonic cross sections and the corresponding (ismanifold) singularities in the complex plane. We compare the results with the corresponding ones obtained in the framework of the (standard) Chiral Perturbation Theory (CHPT) and the (static) Chiral Relativistic Perturbation Theory (CRPT). We show that the main difference between the CPT and the CRPT results is that the latter contains singularities that are generated by the (dynamic) Chiral Symmetry Breaking (CSB) and the (static) Chiral Conservation (CC), whereas the former does not. We explain this difference by the fact that the CPT does not take into account the dynamics of the strong interactions, while the CRPT does. We show that the non-relativistic heavy-light semileptonic cross sections in the framework of the SCPT are universal functions of the total weak matrix elements $\\langle \\ell^{+}_{1} \\ell^{-}_{2} \\rangle$, $\\langle \\ell^{+}_{1} \\ell^{+}_{2} \\rangle$, and $\\langle \\ell^{-}_{1} \\ell^{+}_{2} \\rangle$, that is, they are not sensitive to the particularities of the weak singlet quarkonia. We show that the singularities in the complex plane are generated by the same combinations of the total weak matrix elements, and are also universal. We show that the (relaxation) width of the singularities is related to the strength of the dynamics of the CSB and the corresponding weak glueballs. We discuss the problem of the determination of the relative contributions of the various quarkonia to the heavy-light semileptonic cross section, in the framework of the SCPT."}
{"text":"\nWe propose a hierarchy of representations for open system dynamics based on a density tensor. This hierarchy enables one to efficiently retrieve the noise spectrum, which is a key quantity in many fields, such as physics, chemistry, and biology. In this representation, the dynamics is cast in a form that enables the use of the tensor rank as a diagnostic tool to identify dynamical features, such as symmetry, and to expose the dynamics of interest. Within this framework, we study the properties of the density tensor for simple models ofGlass and Exceptionally Small Cells(GEC) dynamics, and we retrieve the noise spectrum. We find that the tensor has a simple structure in the presence of a small number of exceptions, and that the rank is reduced as the exceptions are removed. We analyze the physical meaning of the rank reduction and show that it is related to the way the noise is generated. This framework can be used to study the dynamics of more complicated models, such as those with many degrees of freedom and many exceptions."}
{"text":"\n\nWe study the development of the r-mode instability and the spin evolution of a young and active neutron star through the model-free auto-correlation function analysis of the low-frequency (below 1 Hz) broadband observations from the Advanced LIGO detectors. Our primary motivation is to understand the role of the r-mode instability in the spin evolution of the young neutron star. Our analysis shows that the r-mode instability is strongly dependent on the spin frequency and the torque-to- inertia ratio. In our model-free analysis, we show that the r-mode instability first develops in a nonlinear fashion and then becomes self-sustained. We explain this development in terms of the interplay between the r-mode instability and the spin evolution of the star. Once the r-mode instability becomes self-sustained, its amplitude continues to increase, causing the spin frequency to increase further, until the star starts to show regular periodicity. At that stage, the torque-to-inertia ratio is too large to be supported by the r-mode instability, and the star enters a full gravity-wave orbit, with a frequency equal to the orbital frequency. We also show that, even if the r-mode instability is strong, the star will not lose much angular momentum if the spin frequency is already close to the gravity-wave frequency. Our results suggest that the r-mode instability has little effect on the spin evolution of a young neutron star if the spin frequency is close to the gravity-wave frequency. We also discuss the effects of the intrinsic nonlinearity of the r-mode instability on the measurement of the gravity waves by advanced LIGO detectors."}
{"text":"\n\nWe introduce and analyze a new auction protocol, which we call quantum auctions, that is both efficient and resistant to cheats. Our protocol is inspired by the fact that quantum communication can be efficiently utilized to achieve tasks that are impossible with classical communication. In particular, we consider the problem of designing an auction protocol that (i) enables efficient auction updating (i.e., allows the auction to be updated in a minimal number of communication steps), (ii) guarantees that the auction will reach a truthful outcome (i.e., an outcome that reflects the true valuations of the bidders) and (iii) is resistant to cheats. We show that a natural generalization of the quantum doubling protocol to the setting of auctions can achieve (i) and (ii) but not (iii). We then modify this protocol to achieve (iii) by using a particular type of encryption that enables the auction to be updated efficiently. We analyze the security of our protocol and show that it is resilient to cheating bidders as well as to a cheating auctioneer who wishes to corrupt the auction's outcome."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present the SDSS Quasar Catalog IV, Fifth Data Release (Q4). The catalog contains photometric redshifts for 112,\u00e9tartimely-interval quasars observed with the SDSS through 2007 February, with fainter quasars observed through 2009 January. Q4 includes all quasars in the SDSS Data Release 7 (DR7) and in the SDSS Legacy Survey, with the exception of a small number of quasars with very low significance (false-alarm) detections. Q4 also includes quasars from the SDSS's supernova survey, SN Ia, and from the SDSS's extended redshift survey, eBOSS. The quasars in these datasets were observed in the same areas of the sky as the SDSS's main galaxy redshift survey, and have the same two-dimensional (2D) coverage as Q3, with the same Galactic latitude (|b| > 2.5\u00b0) and in most of the same survey areas as Q3. Thus, the sky coverage of quasars in Q4 is similar to that in Q3, but with a significantly larger number of quasars. The quasars in Q4 have been divided into three subsets, based on the optical brightness and redshift distribution of the quasars. Q4R is a randomly subset of the quasars in Q4; Q4S is a subset of quasars selected to have similar optical brightness, redshift distribution, and sky coverage to those in Q3; Q4T is a subset of quasars selected to have similar optical brightness and sky coverage to those in Q3, but with a different (and larger) redshift distribution than Q3. This report describes the selection criteria for the quasars in Q4, and contains tables giving the properties of the quasars in the subsets, Q4R, Q4S, and Q4T."}
{"text":"\n\nWide Field Surveys and Astronomical Discovery Space\nWe present a new algorithm for astronomical surveys that combines a wide field of view with a high resolution, both in the spatial and the spectral domains. Such a combination is very efficient for astronomical discoveries, as it allows a large area of the sky to be surveyed at high spectral resolution, making it possible to find very faint objects that would otherwise be drowned in the noise. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method on a real survey of the Galactic Globular Cluster M13, in which we find a previously undiscovered dwarf galaxy that had been hiding in the noise. We show that the new galaxy has a very high abundance of rare elements, suggesting that it is a pristine member of the Galactic halo. The high resolution also reveals that the galaxy is actually composed of two sub-populations of stars, with different radii, metallicities and ages. We discuss the implications of this discovery for the dynamics of the Galactic halo, and in particular for the rough orbits hypothesis. We also show that our method is very efficient in terms of data acquisition, as it requires only a single exposure to achieve the desired sensitivity. We discuss the possibility of applying our method to other types of astronomical surveys, such as extrasolar planet searches."}

We derive the helium abundance, the effective temperature, and the surface gravity of all the main sequence stars in our sample. We find that the helium abundances are in agreement with the predictions of the Chemical Evolution Model. We also derive the slope of the atmosphere's temperature-gravity relation for the main sequence stars in our sample, and we confirm previous results showing that this relation has a positive slope. In addition, we find that our sample of main sequence stars has a larger scatter in the effective temperature than found in previous studies. We finally determine the surface gravity of the white dwarfs in our sample."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present here the analysis of the position-velocity diagrams for the Maser emission coming from a Keplerian ring. Our analysis shows that such diagrams are sensitive to the three-dimensional structure of the background stars and the masing region. We have developed a model which allows us to study the structure of the rings from the analysis of the diagrams, in the same way as has been done for the colliding-wind binary stars. The model consists in considering that the masers are located on an evacuated circular ring, which is being distorted by the gravitational field of the central star. We have compared the model predictions with the data for the circle overlaid on the HSQSO field, and found a good agreement between the two. We have also compared the results of the model with the data for the POSS Ring. Our analysis shows that the data can be described within the framework of the model, if the ring is not distorted, but is rather slightly displaced towards the North-West. We discuss this result in the framework of a possible three-dimensional structure for the POSS Ring, involving a collision between two rings."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a possible explanation for the presence of strong silicate absorption in the Lyman-alpha line of the damped Lyman-alpha absorber at z=0.52. We show that a combination of a non-LTE model for the structure and evolution of the planetary atmosphere, and a chemical model for the evolution of the chemical composition of the atmosphere, can naturally explain the observed silicate absorption, in addition to the previously discovered CO absorption. In particular, our model predicts the silicate absorption to be redshift dependent, in qualitative agreement with observations. We show that the main condensable species in the atmosphere is not CO but C2H2, which explains the observation of only one strong band in the silicate absorption, in addition to the strong band at 9.7 micrometers. The relative abundance of C2H2 with respect to CO is controlled by the atomic hydrogen-to-carbon ratio, which in turn depends on the metallicity of the planet. We discuss the implications of our model for the chemical composition of exoplanet atmospheres."}
{"text":"\nWe present photometry of the globular cluster NGC 5466, obtained as part of our program to search for blue stragglers and red giants in globular clusters. The photometry is based on images obtained through the \u00bd-m f\/3.6 broadband filter of the ISAAC instrument, installed at the VLT UT2 telescope, during the VLT Commissioning Program. The cluster contains a large number of red giants and a well-defined core. The red giant population has a mean photometric magnitude of M1, and the color-magnitude distribution is well described by a two-component red giant population with a constant fraction of M-dwarfs, in good agreement with the theory of Taylor and 1996. The blue straggler population contains a large number of very blue stars, possibly indicating recent or ongoing mass transfer. The mean photometric magnitude of the blue stragglers is M3, and their color distribution is well described by a power law with a temperature of 5000 K. The observed correlation between the blue straggler population and the red giant population is consistent with a scenario where the blue stragglers are formed by the merger of massive red giants. We have detected more than 250 blue stragglers in the cluster, and more than 650 red giants, making NGC 5466 one of the richest globular clusters in terms of these objects."}
{"text":"\n\nWe investigate the effect of imposing symmetry on the structure of vortices in a hexagonal honeycomb lattice and a kagome-lattice-based pinning array. We show that the presence of a six-fold symmetry in the honeycombs or a three-fold symmetry in the kagomes introduces a rotation-symmetric state with a single vortex core. We term this state the vortex molecular crystal state. For both lattices, this state is a strictly-ordered state with a constant number of vortices, and it is one of the few examples of a quasi-molecular crystal state in a vortex system. We also show that the imposition of a four-fold symmetry in the honeycombs or a two-fold symmetry in the kagomes introduces a symmetry-broken state with a vortex core at the center of each symmetry-imposing unit cell, and we term this state the vortex plastic crystal state. The analysis of these states is facilitated by a detailed mapping of the two- vortex system onto a honeycombed or Kagome-lattice-based pinning array, which enables an application of the exactly-soluble combinatorial theory of an expanding symmetric pattern. The application of this theory allows for the determination of the number of vortex rings in the outermost regions of the systems, in terms of the basis states of the vortex system."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a semi-analytic model of the evolution of terrestrial and habitable planets in multiple-star systems. We consider a wide range of system architectures, from simple binary to complex multi-major-body systems. We find that the gravitational interactions between the stars and the planets have a significant effect on the orbital dynamics of the planets, and in particular on the migration of planets to wider orbits. We find that these effects are so large that they can result in the ejection of terrestrial planets from the system, or their migration to orbits where they are unlikely to be habitable. We also consider the effects of the stellar and planetary masses, as well as the initial conditions. We find that the system evolutionary history has a significant effect on the outcome. In particular, we show that the planetary system is more likely to be stable if the planets are formed in a wide orbit, and subsequently migrate to their Habitable Zone (HZ). We also show that the system is more likely to be habitable if the planets are formed in a compact orbit and remain in that orbit throughout the system's evolution. We discuss the possibility that the long-term habitability of the planets in a given system can be improved by the controlled addition of new masses to the system, in order to drive the planets to wider orbits. We also discuss the effects of a system's evolution on the likelihood of the occurrence of habitual planets. We show that a system is less likely to contain habitable planets if the planets are formed in a wide orbit and subsequently migrate to their HZ, than if they are formed and remain in a compact orbit throughout the system's evolution."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider the problem of universal source coding for monotonic and fast decaying monotonic distributions. Let X be a random variable with a monotonic distribution, i.e., a distribution that is right-skewed, left-skewed, or symmetric. Let Y be the complementary distribution of X, i.e., the distribution that results from flipping the signs of X. We show that for any monotonic distribution X there exists an encoding of X that is universal for all distributions in the sense that any distribution can be expressed as a linear combination of X and Y with non-negative coefficients. Our encoding is of the form X'' + iY'' with i > 0. We also consider the special case of symmetric distributions, for which our encoding has the form X + iY. Our proof is based on an explicit representation of the distribution X as a sum of reflecting Markov chains. We show that the same approach can be used to obtain an explicit representation of the distribution Y. We deduce that any encoding of X can be obtained by including a suitable representation of Y. Our approach is based on the connection between universal source coding and superstability. In particular, we show that a superstable source coding scheme can be obtained by combining a suitable source coding scheme for X with a suitable source coding scheme for the distribution Y = 1\/X."}
{"text":"\n\nWe study Difermion condensates in vacuum in 2-4D four-fermion interaction models. We consider an effective two- Fermion model in a four-dimensional space-time in the presence of a non-Abelian symplectic group, which provides a break of the Lorentz invariance. In a four-dimensional space-time, this model has a one-dimensional fermion condensate with a non-Abelian structure. We also consider the evolution of this condensate in a space-time with a three-dimensional axial symmetry. The symplectic group is related to the three-dimensional geometry in the following way: the condensate is either symmetric or antisymmetric under the three-dimensional exchange of the fermions. In a space-time with a four-dimensional rotational symmetry, the fermions are related to the four-dimensional Lorentz invariance. We show that this relation is broken when the condensate becomes symmetric under the three-dimensional exchange of the fermions. This happens in a space-time with a three-dimensional axial symmetry. We also discuss the possibility of the creation of a new quark color by the interaction of the fermions with a D-brane."}

{"text":"\n\nWe present a high-resolution CO(1-0) line image of the extremely metal-poor galaxy I Zw 18, which is potentially the least metal-rich galaxy found so far. We find that the CO(1-0) line flux is significantly lower than predictions from the galaxy's dust and gas masses, suggesting a low level of CO in the I Zw 18's gas. We show that this is likely due to a combination of high radiative cooling and low gas pressure. I Zw 18 is a very good tracer of the minimum metallicity that a galaxy can reach, therefore the low CO content provides important constraints on models of chemical evolution. We find that the most successful model for the chemical evolution of I Zw 18 includes a very efficient radiative cooling at high metallicities, and a low gas pressure at low metallicities. In addition, the strong radial variation in the CO(1-0) line fluxes suggests that I Zw 18 has a relatively low CO(1-0) line luminosity of about 1 L Sun, which corresponds to a very low star formation rate of only about 0.5 per cent of the stellar massyr-1. This suggests that the gas in I Zw 18 has a very low efficiency of conversion of chemical energy to mechanical energy, compared to other galaxies. This could be due to a low gas pressure, or to a very high abundance of heavy elements in the gas."}
{"text":"\nWe present a model for the UV-upturn of elliptical galaxies, based on a semi-quantitative understanding of the gas distribution and gas kinematics in these galaxies. We consider a steady state situation, in which the gas distribution is given by a exponential profile, with the exponential index depending on the galaxy peculiar velocity and the observed gas surface or volume density. In our model, the gas kinematics is described by a two-zone model, with a cold gas component and a hot gas component, each with its own distribution and kinematic parameters. We find that a relatively simple set of parameters is capable of describing the observed distribution of UV-upturn in elliptical galaxies. Our model predicts that the radial distribution of the UV-upturn follows an exponential profile, with the exponential index depending on the fraction of hot gas in the galaxy, the total gas surface or volume density and the peculiar velocity of the galaxy. The excellent agreement between our model predictions and the observed radial distribution of UV-upturn in elliptical galaxies (e.g. 1996ApJ...499..560M, ApJ...storage, ApJ...prop...31...19, ApJ... Sigma 014, 1999) suggests that our model is correct."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate electron-electron interaction effects on the phonon-mediated spin relaxation in quantum dots by means of analytical and numerical techniques. We consider a spherical quantum dot with a spherically symmetric potential and no internal electric field. We find that the spin-phonon interaction in this system is extremely long-range in character. We show that this is due to a very large value of the acoustic impedance Z, which is directly related to the ratio of the angular momentum to the inverse temperature. Therefore, the relaxation is very fast and the dynamic behavior of the system is completely different from that of the elementary particles, such as electrons and phonons. We show that the dynamic behavior of the system can be well described by a single parameter Y, which is related to the damping ratio of the dynamic evolution. We find that Y is always greater than one, which means that the system always relaxes to a state with less disorder. The results obtained are consistent with the fact that electron-electron interaction reduces the entanglement of the system. We also derive a simple expression for the spin relaxation time in this system."}
{"text":"\n\nThe low-mass X-ray binary system J1128+5925 contains a magnetic white dwarf with a relatively long spin period (41.17 \u00b1 0.09 min), a high magnetic field strength (B_WD = 11.48 kG), and a large radius (R_WD = 1.15 R_Sun). We observed the system in quiescence in 2010 and 2011 with the Canadian Astrophysical Observatory's optical\/NIR\/UV\/X-ray Imaging Spectrometer (CaOSIS) on the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, obtaining high-resolution spectra of the white dwarf. These data reveal a strong, rapidly varying X-ray source in the direction of the white dwarf's spin pole. We determine that this X-ray source is a physical anomaly in the photosphere of the accretion disc, and not a distant background source. We show that the white dwarf's spin period is five times shorter than the accretion disc's spin period, and that it is the only white dwarf in a low-mass X-ray binary known to have such a short spin period. This system, therefore, provides a unique opportunity to study the interaction between a magnetic white dwarf and an accretion disc with a relatively long spin period. We conclude that the accretion disc's long spin period is the dominant feature of the disc, and that the white dwarf's spin period is only a secondary feature. Therefore, we expect that the white dwarf's spin period will be stable on timescales of many thousands of years. This system may thus be a candidate for annual modulation."}
{"text":"\n\nWe have performed an atomistic study of structural relaxation around substitutional Cr3+ in MgAl2O4. The electronic structure of Cr3+ in the Mg-rich regions was calculated by density-functional theory, and the resulting orbitals were used to calculate the formation energies of Cr3+ in the various possible sites in MgAl2O4. The results of this calculation were used as input to a subsequent molecular dynamics simulation of structural relaxation, in which the atomic positions of the substitutional Cr3+ were allowed to relax in response to the electrostatic and steric interactions with their surroundings. The final atomic positions were used to calculate the binding energy of Cr3+, which was then compared to the formation energy to determine the degree of structural relaxation that had occurred. We found that the Cr3+ ions were able to achieve a high degree of structural relaxation, with the average binding energy being only slightly higher than the formation energy. This indicates that the Cr3+ ions are well-packed and have a stable structure within the MgAl2O4 matrix."}
{"text":"\n\nA Hierarchical Approach for Dependability Analysis of a Commercial Cache-Based RAID Storage Architecture\n\nWe propose a general approach for dependability analysis of a complex system such as a commercial cache-based redundant array of independent disks (RAID) storage architecture. The approach is based on modeling the system at different abstraction levels, and capturing dependability-related characteristics at each level. The approach is hierarchical, in the sense that the overall dependability of the system is obtained by combining the dependability characteristics of the different abstraction levels. We apply the proposed approach to dependability analysis of a commercial RAID system, and evaluate its effectiveness in terms of system dependability prediction and design space exploration. The evaluation results are compared with those obtained using the conventional dependability analysis approach based on fault trees. The proposed approach is shown to achieve significantly better dependability prediction and design space exploration, due to its ability to consider dependability aspects at different abstraction levels."}
{"text":"\nThe development and accumulation of knowledge is a hallmark of science. In this work we aim at investigating the patterns of knowledge diffusion and the role of the largest universities in this process. We rely on bibliometric data and the complex network theory to analyze the interlinkages of the 100 largest European universities, as ranked by the Times Higher Education ranking, in the science system. We find that knowledge diffusion exhibits a power-law degree distribution, with a clear scaling cutoff, which we argue is related to the fundamental role of the universities in the knowledge production process. We also show that the knowledge diffusion is largely driven by the core of large universities, whereas the periphery, despite its relatively high connectivity, does not play a significant role in this process. We further investigate the correlation between the knowledge diffusion and the ranking position of the universities, and find a strong correlation, which can be well described by a simple linear model. Our results suggest that the large universities are powerful knowledge hubs, which are able to retain the knowledge they produce, but, at the same time, are able to effectively diffuse it to the rest of the system."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a model for the origin of asymmetries in bilateral supernova remnants, based on the idea that the interaction between the supernova (SN) blast wave and the surrounding medium is determined by the structure of the medium.

As a result, the SN remnant is asymmetric even if the initial explosion was symmetric. We discuss how such density structure can arise in galactic haloes and explain why this model cannot explain the observed Galactic SN asymmetries.

{"text":"\nWe investigate a nonstationary pattern in unsynchronizable complex networks, which are characterized by nonidentical interarrival times of random walks on the network. We show that in such networks a nonstationary pattern can arise in the dynamic evolution of the network, while the network's local properties are stationary. We use an elementary random walk model on a general class of unsynchronizable complex networks to describe the evolution of the network's global pattern. Our results show that the nonstationarity of the global pattern can be explained by a superposition of a fast (almost periodic) and a slow (almost stationary) component. We show that the slow component is related to the underlying network structure, while the fast component is not. Our results suggest that nonstationarity of a complex network's global pattern does not necessarily imply the presence of a complex nonstationary process in the dynamics on the network, and a simple random walk model can often explain the nonstationary pattern."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present the discovery of 33 new white dwarf systems within 25 pc of the Sun, as part of the white dwarf search of the SDSS, using data from the SDSS DR7 and DR8. The new systems are found in the course of a re-examination of the SDSS data in the light of the definitive white dwarf determination of the progenitor stars of the Gliese Dz system. We present new optical photometry for all of the systems, as well as proper motion and radial velocity data for a large subset of the systems. We determine the white dwarf masses and find that the majority of the white dwarfs in our sample have masses in the range 0.6 to 1.0 M(circle dot), with a total range of 1.3 M(circle dot) in the most massive system. We find that there is a good correlation between the white dwarf mass and the metallicity of the system, with the more massive systems containing larger amounts of heavy elements. We also find a correlation between the white dwarf mass and the orbital period, with the most massive systems having the shortest orbital periods. The white dwarfs in these systems have relatively high temperatures, and we present a model in which the white dwarf cools by a few hundred degrees over the course of several billion years. We discuss the implications of our findings for galactic chemical evolution, as well as the evolution of massive white dwarf systems."}
{"text":"\nWe have developed a new method for investigating the properties of atomic nuclei, based on the analysis of the distribution of statistical Shannon entropies associated with the emission of radiation by nuclear excited states. We show that, in addition to the well-known properties related to the standard model of atomic nuclei, our method reveals new properties, which are related to the concepts of fractal and recurrence, that we have introduced in this field for the first time. We find that the entropies distribution has a fractal structure, and that this fractal structure is related to the occurrence of recurrent patterns in the distribution of the amplitudes of the emitted radiation. Our method is based on the use of non-linear measures of statistical entropies, such as the difference between the entropies associated with the emission of radiation and the entropies associated with the excitation of the corresponding quantum states. Our results show that the new properties found are related to the violation of the commutativity and the associativity of the operations of multiplication and addition, in the set of the quantum numbers which describe the atomic nuclei."}
{"text":"\nAbstract: Dielectronic recombination of Fe XV to form Fe XIV has been studied in the laboratory and theoretically. The Fe XV ion has a large radius and is known to be highly excited in the first few ionization states. The large ion size and large orbital angular momentum make it possible for the electron to be released along the entire rotational path, with a significant degree of probability. The relatively large molecular weight and very large electronic spin make it possible to observe a significant magnetic-field-induced splitting in the electronic states. We have measured the magnetic-field-induced splitting in the lowest electronic state, and found it to be much larger than expected on the basis of the molecular weight alone. The results are consistent with an inner-shell ionization process, with the inner-shell electron being released along the entire rotational path. We have also observed a large number of excited electronic states, and have developed a theory for the excited states in which a large number of molecular orbitals are populated. The theory also accounts for the large magnetic-field-induced splitting in the lowest electronic state."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present new extragalactic radio source data from the WMAP mission that is a major improvement over previous data sets both in sensitivity and in angular resolution. These data are used to probe the distribution of matter on scales of 10-30 Mpc. We show that the previously reported Cold Spot is in fact a statistical fluke, and that the distribution of matter is in fact extremely well described by a model in which matter is smoothly and homogeneously distributed in aLambdaCDM model, with no need for a large-scale structure such as a Cold Spot. We show that the power spectrum is in excellent agreement with a LambdaCDM model with a flat power spectrum, and that this model explains both the large scale structure and the small scale structure in a completely consistent manner. We find that there is no evidence for a small scale power law contribution, in conflict with previous claims that the small scale power spectrum had power law components. We show that a simple model in which small scale structure is generated by small scale power law sources, with the amplitude of the power law decline proportional to the volume occupied by matter, can quantitatively reproduce the observed power spectrum, and can also account for the difference in power spectrum between low- and high-resolution surveys. We estimate the small scale power law source strength to be 1.4 +\/- 1.0 per cu Mpc, in excellent agreement with the observations."}
{"text":"\n\nSmooth and Starburst Tidal Tails in the GEMS and GOODS Fields\nWe present photometric detections of smooth and starburst tidal tails in the Galaxy's outer disk in the regions of the GEMS and GOODS fields. The observations were made with two identical multi-band imaging polarimeters, T-ReCS1 and T-ReCS2, mounted on the 1.5 m and 2.0 m telescopes at the Observatorio Astron\u00f3mico de C\u00f3rdoba (OAC), Spain, as part of the T-ReCS survey. We find that the stellar population in the smooth tidal tails is younger than the disk stars but has not been rejuvenated by the accretion shock heating. In contrast, the starburst tidal tails show strong dust extinction and the stellar population is older than in the disk, which is confirmed by the position in the color\u2013magnitude diagram and by the stellar evolutionary tracks. The total contribution of the tidal tail stars to the global galaxy population is small, with a mean effective number density of 2.7 \u00d7 10-5 Mpc-3 in the outer disk, and does not show clear variations with radius. We estimate that the tidal tail in the GEMS field is about 55 kpc long, while in the GOODS field it is at least 95 kpc. Our data also reveal the presence of a small-scale (3\u20134 kpc) structure in the smooth tidal tail in the GEMS field, which we provisionally attribute to the interaction with the nearby dwarf spheroidal galaxy Sagittarius. The largest projected extent of the starburst tidal tail in the GOODS field is slightly larger than the one previously reported in the Tadpole Galaxy. We discuss the implications of our findings for galactic dynamics, the evolution of the outer disk, and the generation of stellar streams."}

{"text":"\nWe investigate the statistical and dynamical properties of a system composed of two coupled quantum dots, in the crossover between the Gaussian Orthogonal and Unitary ensembles. The problem is motivated by the study of quantum information processing with solid state devices, and by the observation of quantum statistical effects in nuclear and molecular physics. Our method is based on the use of the renormalization group technique to evaluate the superconducting $T_c$ and the fluctuation magnetization of the system, in the framework of the Stochastic Potts Model. The renormalization group approach provides a rigorous way to evaluate the critical temperature and the fluctuation magnetization in a system with many degrees of freedom, beyond the exact counting of the elementary excitations. Our results show a strong enhancement of the superconducting $T_c$ as compared to the equilibrium $T_c$, and a strong increase of the fluctuation magnetization as compared to the equilibrium magnetization. We discuss the physical origin of these effects, in terms of the interplay between the static and the dynamic correlation functions. Our results suggest that systems in the crossover between the Gaussian Orthogonal and Unitary ensembles may have interesting applications in quantum information processing."}
{"text":"\nWe introduce the twisted coproduct of a Poincar\u00e9 group. We show that this is a generalization of the affine Lie algebras to the setting of relative impoverished Poincar\u00e9 groups.

We also describe the twisted coproduct of the Poincar\u00e9 group in terms of the invariant asked for by Hilbert's 16th problem, namely the number of non-zero derivatives of a solution to a homogeneous polynomial system of differential equations. This allows to give a description of the twisted coproduct of the Poincar\u00e9 group in terms of bi-invariant functions on the space of differential forms on a smooth projective variety. As an application we show that the twisted coproduct of the Poincar\u00e9 group acts on the space of global sections of certain sheaves in a way which is reminiscent of the way the ordinary Poincar\u00e9 group acts on the space of sections of certain vector bundles."}

{"text":"\n\nWe propose a model of the early universe based on string theory. In our model the formation of the early universe is described by the formation of various 2-D membranes, in a process which is analogous to the formation of the 1-D string theory universe. Our model has several new features, which are absent in the usual version of string theory cosmology. First, our model has a non-trivial topology, which describes the universe as a three-dimensional space-time with non-trivial topology. Second, the model describes the early universe as a set of 2-D membranes, which collide and fuse with each other. The resulting space-time has a very complicated structure, with many \"branes\" (membranes) which are \"stacked\" on top of each other. Third, the model describes the early universe as a dynamic process, in which the branes evolve and change their properties. In particular, the model describes the early universe as a process of \"stringy inflation\", in which the size of the universe increases dramatically, due to the dynamics of the string theory. Finally, our model has some physical consequences, which are not present in the usual string theory cosmology. In particular, our model predicts the existence of \"antimatter branes\", which are invisible to ordinary matter, but which can be detected by a \" Dirac detector\"."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a statistical study of the isophotal structure of galaxies in the SDSS, based on their two-dimensional (2D) images. We find that the isophotes of galaxies in the SDSS show significant non-axisymmetry, which cannot be described by a simple Gaussian function. The isophotes of galaxies in groups are more axisymmetric than those of field galaxies, but still show significant non-axisymmetry. The isophotes of galaxies in groups also appear to be more aligned with the group's optical axis, but the alignment is not perfect and is significantly worse for groups containing an active galactic nucleus (AGN). We further split the galaxy groups according to the presence or absence of an AGN and find that the isophotes of galaxies in groups with an AGN are more aligned with the group's optical axis than those in groups without an AGN. These results suggest that the distribution of galaxies in a group, and the fact that the group contains an AGN, may both be important factors in the determination of the isophotal structure of galaxies in groups."}
{"text":"\nWe present a physical model that accounts for the observed properties of early-type galaxies in a manner that is consistent with the predictions of the cold dark matter theory on large scales, but does not require ad-hoc fine-tuning. In our model, the galaxies are treated as overdense regions in an otherwise rarefied Universe, and are assumed to have formed through the collapse of perturbations that are either (i) small-scale fluctuations in a smooth distribution, (ii) droplets formed through the gravitational collapse of larger density peaks, or (iii) a combination of these two. We show that this model naturally explains why galaxies are found in groups, why they have the sizes they do, why they have the colours they do, and why they are evolving the way they do. In particular, the model predicts that galaxies should exhibit a strong correlation between their mass and their colour, with massive galaxies being mostly blue and small galaxies being mostly red. We show that this prediction is consistent with observations, provided that the galaxy colours are corrected for the age of the Universe. We also show that the model predicts that the large-scale structure of the galaxies should be formed through the gravitational collapse of large density peaks, rather than through the accretion of smaller galaxies. We discuss the implications of our model for the theories of galaxy formation and evolution, and for the interpretation of observations of galaxies and large-scale structure."}

We find that the ground state of this general model has a non-trivial structure which is very different from the well known disordered ground state of the Kagome lattice. We analyze the low-lying excitations of this ground state and find a number of bound states which have very different properties from the usual spins on the Kagome lattice. We also study the disordered limit of our general model and find that the resulting ground state has a very simple structure which is similar to the known disordered ground state of the Kagome lattice.

{"text":"\nWe present a statistical analysis of the hardness of the spectrum of low-power blazars in the 9 years of EGRET data. We find that the hardest portions of the blazar spectra are the most variable on timescales from weeks to years, consistent with thermal stratification of the accretion flow. The most energetic photons tend to come from the hardest spectrum portions. We find that the spectral index, defined as the ratio of the count rate in the hardest M15 and hardest M20 energy bands, is well described by a power law with an index of -1.91 +- 0.09 and a significance level of 4sigma. This index is nearly constant (at the 1sigma level) for all but the very highest power law galaxies, and does not harden with flux. We find that the count rate in the M15 and M20 energy bands is described by a single power law with an index of -2.35 +- 0.1 and a significance level of 3sigma. We find that the difference between the count rates in the two energy bands is described by a power law with an index of -1.06 +- 0.08 and a significance level of 4sigma. We discuss these results in the context of models of the blazar accretion flow, and find that they are consistent with a simple model in which the accretion flow is optically thick, and the observed hardness is due only to radiative cooling and not to other effects such as electron thermal conduction or the presence of a harder seed spectrum."}
{"text":"\nWe present a new method for recovering galaxy star formation and metallicity histories from spectral data using the Visual EXpression System for Physics and Astronomy (VESPA). We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method by applying it to a set of high-resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) spectra of galaxies in the distant Universe, obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The method is based on the recognition that the strengths of the metal absorption lines are proportional to the metallicity of the galaxy, while the star formation rate is proportional to the total H\u03b1 luminosity. We have implemented these relations in VESPA, using the principal component analysis (PCA) method to extract the corresponding parameters. We find that the method is reliable and robust, and we demonstrate that the recovered parameters are consistent with those derived from the photometric analysis of the same galaxies, thus providing a robust spectral diagnosis of galaxy properties. The method is suitable for low SNR spectra as well as high SNR spectra, and can thus be applied to a variety of astronomical data sets, including, for example, the high-redshift Universe, where the SNR is often low."}
{"text":"\n\nWe report the results of a search for gravitational-wave bursts in LIGO data from the fourth science run.

Our search method combines a general-purpose burst detection algorithm based on the ransom note transform with a scanning algorithm that uses the output of the burst detection algorithm to identify new burst events in an efficient manner. We find no evidence of gravitational-wave bursts in the data set, and set upper limits on the burst flux integrated over the search frequency band 0.1\u20131 Hz. For bursts with duration between 0.5 and 2 s, we set an upper limit of 2.3 events per year per detector, which corresponds to a total fluence of 2.6 erg cm\u22122. This limit is independent of the number of detectors and of the actual event duration. For bursts with duration between 1 and 10 s, we set an upper limit of 1.3 events per year per detector, which corresponds to a total fluence of 1.6 erg cm\u22122. These limits are robust with respect to the choice of the burst detection algorithm. Our results are consistent with the absence of bursts, and do not rule out the possibility of a small number of transient events in the data set."}
{"text":"\nWe present a detailed study of the structure and evolution of the cosmic large-scale structure, using a combination of sophisticated numerical simulations and semi-analytic models. We find that the large-scale structure grows efficiently, in a self-similar manner, with a power law exponent of 1.7 \u00b1 0.1, and is consistent with the predictions of the standard theory of structure formation. However, we find that the small-scale structure, responsible for the bulk of the mass, has a different power law exponent, 2.4 \u00b1 0.2, and is more efficiently coupled to the large-scale structure than the standard theory predicts. Our results suggest that the small-scale structure forms efficiently, in a self-similar manner, with the large-scale structure. We also present a detailed study of the evolution of ionization in the early Universe.

{"text":"\n\nWe present multiwavelength observations of the jet-disturbed molecular gas near the Seyfert 2 nucleus in M51. We combine far-infrared data from the Herschel Space Telescope with submillimeter data from the SCUBA-2 camera on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope to reveal the distribution of molecular gas, in order to better understand the relationship between the nuclear starburst and the infalling molecular clouds. We find that the bulk of the molecular gas is not contained within the galactic plane, but is instead distributed in a large, off-plane region. The gas in this region is not gravitationally bound to the galaxy and is potentially available to be accreted by the M51 nucleus. We further find that this gas is heated by a non-nuclear source, most likely an oblique jet arising from the nuclear starburst. The gas is cooled as it flows towards the plane, forming a wake behind the jet. We explain this cooling in terms of a simple model in which the gas is cooled by the expanding bubble of the heated gas, similar to the way in which the density and temperature of a gas is reduced when it is inflated inside a balloon. This model provides a natural explanation for the cooling of the gas and the lack of strong far-infrared emission from the gas in the plane."}

We also present new information on the inner structure of the discs in the CVs V Boo, HQ Hydrae, and V1343 Cyg, based on the analysis of the emission-line data. Finally, we present the results of a targeted search for water maser lines in the atmosphere of three CVs. This is the first search for water in the atmosphere of CVs using the VLBI technique."}
{"text":"\n\nWe have developed a new method for investigating the three-dimensional distribution of solar-like stars in the Milky Way and applied this method to the recent Hipparchus and Gaia data. We show that the Sun is displaced by about 2.5 kpc from the plane in which the majority of stars in the Galactic disk lie, and that this displacement increases with distance from the Sun. We estimate that the Sun is about 50pc above the plane and that this 'ecliptic plane' is inclined by about 60\u00b0 to the Galactic plane. We find that the distribution of solar-like stars in the three-dimensional volume defined by the Galactic plane and the ecliptic plane is consistent with a flat distribution on the ecliptic plane, with a gentle outward trend in density away from the Sun. The properties of this 3D stellar distribution are consistent with it being due to a combination of the orbital motions of stars in the Galactic disk and the propagation of the two-dimensional stellar density distribution in the Galactic plane, which is known to be highly non-uniform. We show that this 3D stellar distribution can be explained in terms of the properties of the local Galactic neighborhood, without requiring a hypothesis of large-scale structure in the Galactic disk."}
{"text":"\n\nWe investigate correlation amplitude and entanglement entropy in random spin chains. We show a clear signature of entanglement evolution in the correlation amplitude as a function of the thermal length, L_{th}, in a random chain. The correlation amplitude decays algebraically with a characteristic length, L_{cor}, which is shown to be equal to the minimal number of basis exchanges needed to change the state of the chain, in agreement with the intuition that the correlation amplitude is related to the \"connectedness\" of the quantum state. We find that the correlation amplitude evolves much more quickly with the thermal length than the entanglement entropy. For chains with more than one entanglement-bond per chain, we find a non-monotonic behavior of the entanglement entropy as a function of the thermal length, with a minimum in between the bond-ences. Our results are consistent with a simple model of a random spin chain, where the entanglement is generated by the addition of a small number of \"special\" basis exchanges in a set of basis exchanges which are chosen randomly according to a Boltzmann distribution. We also discuss a variant of the spin glass model, where the randomness is added to the Hamiltonian instead of the basis exchanges. In this case the correlation amplitude is shown to evolve much more slowly with the thermal length, in qualitative agreement with the results for the basis exchange model."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a new planet detection method, SIM PlanetQuest, which combines speckle imaging and lucky imaging to achieve dramatically improved sensitivity to planetary transits. This method relies on recent technological advances in the control of the images in a Charged-Coupled Device (CCD) camera, which allows one to obtain multiple images of a star in a single observation period. We show that by combining multiple images, one can achieve the necessary signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to detect planetary transits around solar-type main sequence stars, brown dwarfs, and even giant stars. We show that by combining these transit detections with Lucky Imaging, we can determine the three-dimensional orbits of these planets and thus determine whether they are habitable or not. We show that this method can detect habitable planets around stars that are ten times farther away than those detected by the Kepler mission, as well as habitable planets in other solar systems. This method thus provides the most promising near-term technique to detect, find the mass of, and determine the orbits of nearby habitable planets."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present infrared observations of the rich cluster galaxy MS 1054-03 (AB 2545=02.5 and 02.9), in the hope of better understanding its star formation and evolution. We find a total of eighteen galaxy members in the field, including MS 1054-03 itself, in which we detect a bright point source possibly related to the young cluster population. Our main result is a strong correlation between the stellar mass surface density and the stellar mass of the galaxies in the cluster, indicating that a major fraction of the star formation in the cluster has already taken place and that the remaining galaxies are relatively quiescent. A simple model in which the stellar mass of an infalling galaxy is given by the stellar mass surface density of the cluster times the galaxy's volume times the galaxy's evolutionary timespan, provides a good fit to the data and suggests that the cluster has evolved through a major starburst some time in the past. We discuss the relevance of our findings for galaxy evolution in rich clusters, and in particular for the prediction of semi-analytic models that galaxies stop forming stars in clusters.\n\nWe also present a multiwavelength study of the cluster galaxies in the field, in an attempt to shed light on the nature of the central galaxy and the mechanism(s) responsible for its excitation. The central galaxy shows continuum emission and a point source in the same location, but no obvious optical counterpart, suggesting that the continuum emission may be due to hot dust rather than a AGN. The possible nature of the point source is discussed. We find that the cluster galaxies are typically galaxies in transition, with many showing clear signs of recent star formation, but with their colors also indicative of ongoing galaxy evolution."}
{"text":"\n\nSensor Networks with Random Links: Topology Design for Distributed Consensus\n\nWe consider the problem of achieving distributed consensus in a wireless sensor network with randomly formed links. We show that the underlying topology of the network has a strong impact on the ability of the network to reach consensus, and in particular, that a lack of connectivity can lead to a consensus failure. To address this problem, we propose a topology design strategy that aims to maximize the number of connected components of the network, while also minimizing the number of links between different components. Our strategy is based on the idea of jointly designing the position and orientation of the sensors, so as to control the formation of links between them. We show that our proposed topology design can significantly improve the performance of the network in terms of its ability to reach consensus, and we demonstrate the effectiveness of our design strategy using both simulations and theoretical analysis."}
{"text":"\n\nWe monitored the blazar PKS0537-441 simultaneously in optical and near-infrared (NIR) light during 2005 April-December, in order to study the accretion and ejection processes in the jet. The optical data were obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope, and the NIR data with the Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) on board the Swift satellite. We find that the accretion and ejection processes occur at different levels in the jet, which explains the simultaneous presence of these processes in the light curve. The observations also reveal a large number of low-frequency ( quasi-monochromatic) episodes in the NIR light curve, some of which are associated with the accretion and ejection processes, and some are not. The accretion and ejection processes produce rapid NIR transients with energy crashes, but the energy crashes are not always accompanied by a drop in the total NIR flux, since the accretion and ejection processes occur at different levels in the jet. We also find that the accretion process is faster than the ejection process, and that the ejection process is very efficient, producing a large number of low-mass ejections. Our results suggest that the accretion and ejection processes are well described by a model in which the accretion and ejection processes occur at different levels in the jet, and the accretion process is faster and more efficient than the ejection process."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present observations of the magnetic Cataclysmic Variable (CV) HS 0922+1333 in 2002 September. We combine photometric observations with radio observations from the VLBA to obtain a complete data set of the orbital period. We find a period of 95.0 \u00b1 0.3 min, which is shorter than the orbital period found from observations in 1997 by investigators from Chile. We find a semi-major axis of 1.37 \u00b1 0.02 R\u2299, which is consistent with the 1997 observations. We determine the radius of the secondary star to be 0.6 R\u2299, also consistent with the 1997 observations. The orbital decay found in our observations is consistent with a potential function with two fitted parameters: the ratio of the primary-secondary masses and the ratio of the primary-secondary radii. We find a mass ratio of 1.62 \u00b1 0.07 and a radius ratio of 1.51 \u00b1 0.08. We find a total system mass of 1.6 M\u2299, which is smaller than the system mass found in the 1997 observations. We discuss our results in the context of the orbital decay observed in the non-magnetic CVs and in other magnetic CVs. We show that the decay rates are consistent with a single power law decay (with an index of \u22120.7 \u00b1 0.2) for the orbital period. We find that this power law decay is consistent with the hypothesis that the magnetic field is able to extract energy from the orbital motion only when it is misaligned with the orbital angular momentum, and it can do so only when the secondary star is at a certain range of distances from the primary star."}
{"text":"\n\nIn 1912, a nova in the star cluster Pleiades occurred. The nova was in the photographic field of the young and brilliant astronomer from Denmark, Poul Andersen. Because the nova was in the same star cluster as the recently discovered binary star Pleione, Andersen suggested that the nova was simply a disappearance of a third body in the same system. However, the spectra of the nova showed it to be a classical nova, which was subsequently named Nova Geminorum 1912. Andersen's hypothesis of a disappearance in the Pleione system was soon forgotten. In this paper, we briefly review the history of Nova Geminorum 1912 and the idea of gravitational lensing. We analyze the observations of the nova in the light of the available data and also in the light of the modern understanding of the nova phenomenon. We show that the nova was indeed in the Pleione system and that the observations support the idea that it was a case of gravitational lensing. Thus, a century ago, an astronomer was on the right track to discover one of the most spectacular phenomena in astronomy: gravitational lensing."}

{"text":"\nWe present a new algorithm for computing the magnetic field in a protoplanetary disk based on the magnetohydrodynamic equations. Our method does not require the introduction of any empirical model, such as the magnetic field amplification factor. We obtain a good agreement with the observations of the magnetic field in the solar nebula, as well as in the disks around other stars. The new algorithm is based on an adequate spatial sampling and the proper treatment of the divergence of the magnetic field, taking into account the azimuthal and radial variations of the field in the disk. In addition, we propose a new parameterization of the magnetic field in the disk, which allows a simple evaluation of the field in the plane of the disk. Our results show that the magnetic field is generated mainly in the upper part of the disk, with a minimum value in the midplane, in agreement with the observations. We also show that the field in the plane is mainly toroidal, with a contribution of about one order of magnitude higher than the poloidal component, in agreement with the predictions of the Parker instability theory. Finally, we discuss the problem of the formation of the magnetic field in the disk, and we analyze the physical properties of the magnetic grains that might be responsible for the generation of the field."}
{"text":"\nWe have carried out a timing observation of the radio pulsar PSR J1930+1852 in the context of a wider search for pulsars in low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs). The observations were made with the Whipple Observatory 10-m telescope and the Interferometer Pharos Array (IPA) and covered a period of nearly three years. We find no evidence of a photometric or timing correlation between the radio pulsar and the X-ray transient in the same system, PSR J1930+1852. We determine a 2-sigma upper limit of 4.6 hours on the orbital period of the system, which excludes the low-hard X-ray transient as being in a wide-binodal orbit with many long-period (>> 3 hours) flares. The observed properties of PSR J1930+1852 are consistent with a model in which the radio and X-ray sources are in a narrow-binodal orbit with many short-period (<< 3 hours) flares. We discuss this in the context of known LMXBs and the limited statistics available. We find that a simple model in which the accretion disc is treated as a uniform density sphere of the given radius is consistent with the observed data, and we estimate the accretion disc radii for PSR J1930+1852 and five other LMXBs with well-determined radii. The resulting probability distribution function (PDF) for disc radii is consistent with a power law with a high-mass cut-off of 3 solar masses, but we are unable to distinguish between a steep power law ( P Mrad \u221d r-3) and a shallower power law ( P Mrad \u221d r-2) for the mass distribution. The high-mass cut-off in the accretion disc radius PDF excludes a pure Roster matrix model for the mass distribution, but is consistent with a stepped distribution in which the low-mass (<< 3 solar masses) accretion disc is described by a Roster matrix and the high-mass (>> 3 solar masses) accretion disc is described by a random matrix. We discuss the implications of our results for the theory of LMXBs."}
{"text":"\nWe present photometric data on the distribution of the molecular absorption in front of the quasar B0218+357. The main motivation for this research was the surprising result of an earlier study of this quasar, where a strong absorption feature was found in the quasar's spectrum. The aim of the present work is to examine the distribution of this molecular absorption feature in front of the quasar. We found that the feature is very broad, and it has a FWHM of about 8 arc minutes. We conclude that the absorbing gas is distributed in a layer, which has a thickness of about 4 kpc. This is roughly the distance at which the feature is observed. We also conclude that this layer has a non-uniform distribution, since the strength of the feature is higher at the quasar's left side than at the right side. We discuss several possible explanations for this non- uniformity. The most likely explanation is that the feature is caused by a ring-like distribution of molecular gas, possibly surrounding the quasar. Another possible explanation is that the gas distribution is asymmetric, but this explanation requires a more detailed analysis of the data."}
{"text":"\nWe present a new method to determine the relative contribution of the three major sources of cosmic rays (CRs): the sun, the galaxy, and extragalactic objects. The method is based on the detection of cosmogenic neutrinos, which are produced in the neutrino-nucleon collisions that occur as CRs traverse the interstellar medium. We show that, in contrast to the large uncertainty in the current determination of the extragalactic CRs based on the measurement of the helium-3 (3He) abundance in meteorites, the neutrino method provides a direct and precise measurement of the extragalactic component. We evaluate the prospects of detecting the neutrinos with a detector in the ice cap over the Antarctica, and determine the necessary exposure to obtain a precise measurement of the extragalactic CRs. The main scientific motivation of the neutrino method is to provide a precise determination of the transition between the galactic and extragalactic CRs, which is important for the understanding of the formation of the CRs, the interstellar medium, and the chemical evolution of the Galaxy."}
{"text":"\nWe present here an interdisciplinary study in which the tools of celestial mechanics are used to examine some of the issues raised by the DAMA\/NIM-wide-area-survey\/ asap experiments. We show that an appropriately simple model can describe the motion of both the DAMA\/NIM and asap detectors. This model is based on the relative motion of the Earth and a point-mass \"Planet X\" in a guess-range spherical potential well, the deepest part of which is located at the orbit of the Kuiper belt. In this model the amplitudes of the DAMA\/NIM and asap signals are determined by the Earth's velocity as it moves in and out of the well, while the phase of the signal depends on the exact location of the Earth within the well. We show that the combination of a suitable choice of the well's location and the Earth's entry and exit velocities can explain both the observed DAMA\/NIM and asap data, without the need to introduce any other relativistic effects. Within this model the simplest explanation for the observed data is that the well is centered at the orbit of the Kuiper belt, and that the Earth's entry and exit velocities from the well are the same, in which case the Earth's orbit is a closed, unchanging, ellipse. We show that the data can also be explained if the well is slightly offset from the Kuiper belt, in which case the Earth's orbit slowly converges to a closed, unchanging, ellipse. We also show that the data can be explained if the well is centered very far from the Sun, in which case the Earth's orbit slowly diverges from a closed, unchanging, ellipse. We discuss several ways in which the \"Planet X\" model can be tested, and we point out that the motion of the Earth can be used to determine the location of the well, provided that the well's potential is known."}
{"text":"\nWe show that the low energy behavior of certain non-Abelian string theories allows to generate an extra massless fermionic quarklike particle which is able to explain the abundance of matter in the universe. The main tool is a generalization of the so-calledTigeromasetti to the non-Abelian case. We pay special attention to the way the various matter contents in the universe can be implemented by the same theory in different ways, which explains why the matter abundance can take different values in different models. The idea is related to the so-called twin concept in string theory, but the non-Abelian nature of the theory under consideration gives a more flexible structure. We also show that the same theory is able to generate gravity in a manner which is consistent with the latest data, but in this case the resulting theory is not able to explain the matter abundance. The idea can be understood as a generalization of the so-called prediction from string phenomenology, recently proposed by gravity phenomenologists."}
{"text":"\nWe present observations of the radio galaxy S255N in which we search for an explanation of the excess X-ray emission recently discovered in this source. We show that the radio source is a double-lobed structure containing a bright compact source at the center, possibly a supermassive black hole (SMBH), and a more extended source in the east-west direction. We find that the extended source is unable to explain the observed X-ray excess, and we therefore suggest that the SMBH is more massive than expected from the radio emission, perhaps as massive as or even more massive than the one in M87. We estimate the mass of the SMBH in S255N to be  \u223c 1012\u20131014 M\u2299, assuming a distance of  \u223c 55 kpc. This would make the SMBH in S255N (1) one of the most massive SMBHs known, and (2) more massive than required to power the X-ray emission in the double-lobed structure, suggesting that the SMBH in S255N is also likely to power the accretion disk seen in the optically violent events (OVEs) observed in the outskirts of the galaxy. We suggest that S255N contains a massive SMBH, perhaps at the center of a large accretion disk, and that this SMBH is responsible for the OVEs, making S255N a unique laboratory for studying the accretion disk around a SMBH."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present electron nanocrystallographic results on the dynamics of size-selected gold nanoparticles. We investigate the effects of laser irradiation on a gold nanoparticle covered with a thin silver shell, using a femtosecond laser with a wavelength-selected pulse duration in the extreme ultraviolet regime. We find that the nanoparticle undergoes a fast displacement, with a rise time on the order of picoseconds, and subsequent oscillations around its equilibrium position, with a frequency on the order of 100 GHz. We determine the single-particle dynamics by analyzing the electron diffraction patterns in the transient state, from which we deduce the displacement of the particle as a function of time. The underlying physical mechanism for the transient dynamics is a competition between the energy deposited by the laser pulse and the elastic energy of the particle-shell system. Our results provide new insight into the dynamics of nanoscale materials that are relevant to optical heating and thermo-mechanical nanomechanics."}
{"text":"\n\nSBF: multi-wavelength data and models\nThe long-wavelength solar background radiation (SBF) has been extensively studied over the past four decades, but many questions remain open, in particular with respect to the contribution from the interplanetary medium and the radiation from the photosphere. We have carried out a comparative study of the full-resolution (1-km) solar radiation fields, at six different wavelengths, from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and the Solar Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), with special emphasis on the so-calledme breweries in the solar photosphere, in order to determine their relative contribution to the SBF. We find that the well-known infrared and ultraviolet bright points can be responsible for the bulk of the total intensity in the long-wavelength part of the radiation field, depending on the observing wavelength. We also found a strong correlation between the total intensity and the temperature for these bright points, indicating that the thermal emission is the main contribution to the long-wavelength SBF in the photosphere. By comparing the full-resolution data with the results from a photospheric model, we are able to attribute the relative contribution from the photosphere to the total SBF to several types of bright points, with the temperature-2018: an intense magnetic field and the small-scale random fields being the main candidates. In addition, we have found that the shape and the intensity distribution of these bright points in the ultraviolet and the infrared are well described by a simple mathematical expression."}
{"text":"\n\nUnstable and Stable Galaxy Models\n\nWe present a numerical study of the evolution of galaxies in a toy Universe, with a model that combines an unstable galaxy model with a stable galaxy model. The unstable galaxy model is based on the simplification that the orbital speed of stars and gas around the galactic center is equal to the escape speed. The stable galaxy model is based on the assumption that the orbital speed of stars and gas is smaller than the escape speed. We find that in the unstable model the spiral galaxies evolve toward an equilibrium state in which the inner part of the bulge is very dense and the outer part is very dilute. In the stable model the spiral galaxies also evolve toward an equilibrium state, but in this case the density distribution is more uniform. We find that the two unstable galaxies in our toy Universe evolve in a different way, despite initial conditions that are very similar. The stable galaxies in our toy Universe evolve in a similar way. We also find that the evolution of the unstable galaxies is sensitive to the initial conditions, while the evolution of the stable galaxies is not sensitive to the initial conditions."}
{"text":"\nWe develop a phenomenological theory of spin excitations in cuprate superconductors based on the formation of a non-commensurate magnetic layer with a strongly anisotropic Heisenberg spin-glass order. The theory explains the experimental observations of the anisotropic spin-glass order in La- and Y-based cuprates, and describes the competition between this order and the spin-flavor-locked (SFL) spin excitations. We show that the anisotropic spin-glass order is induced by an anisotropic interaction between the spin-1\/2 and spin-3\/2 carriers, and that this interaction is strong for the Y-based cuprates and weak for the La-based cuprates. The theory predicts a strong temperature dependence of the spin-glass order and the SFL spin excitations. We analyze the different phases of the SFL spin excitations and find that the low-temperature state can be described by the so-called BCM (Bose-Einstein condensation of magnetic excitations) model. We also found a good agreement between the theory and the experimental observations of the incommensurate magnetic structure and the SFL spin excitations in the high-temperature state."}
{"text":"\nWe investigated the effect of the dielectric environment on the electronic and optical properties of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) using the first-principles-based random phase approximation (RPA). The screening effect of the dielectric medium on the electronic states of SWCNTs was found to be significant. We observed a redshift of the exciton transition energy as the dielectric permittivity was increased, in qualitative agreement with the results of previous empirical and theoretical studies. The origin of this effect was traced to the screening of the Coulomb interaction between the electron and hole. The relative strength of this interaction was found to be the determining factor of the exciton transition energy, in agreement with the intuitive expectation that the stronger the Coulomb interaction, the larger the transition energy. We also found that the exciton transition energy was inversely proportional to the SWCNT length, as expected from the gradual screening of the molecular orbitals as the SWCNT size is increased. Our results provide a useful guide to the design of SWCNT-based optical nanodevices, such as light-emitting diodes and solar cells, where the exciton transition energy is a key parameter."}

We then consider the case in which this number is also an increasing function of time. We show that in this case the problem can be reduced to the Hamiltonicity problem. We finally consider the special case in which the number of times a edge has been used so far is an increasing function of time and also has a linear lower bound. We show that in this case the problem can be reduced to the Hamiltonicity problem with additional constraints on the edges."}
{"text":"\nWe have developed a new method for the determination of low-energy parameters of neutron\u2013proton (n\u2013p) scattering on the basis of modern experimental data from partial-wave analyses. The main idea of the method is to use the information on the n\u2013p scattering in the partial-wave regime to determine the width of the dominant partial wave, the so-called partial-wave width (PWW). We show that, in the framework of the Einstein\u2013Bohr theory, the PWW is related to the width of the p-wave resonance in the scattering amplitude. Therefore, the PWW can be determined from the analysis of the experimental data on the p-wave intensity in the partial-wave regime. We demonstrate that this method does not require the assumption of a small parameter, which describes the p-wave contribution to the total cross section in the partial-wave regime. Hence, our method can be used to determine the PWW in the case of a large p-wave contribution to the total cross section. We show that our method is equivalent to the common method based on the analysis of the structure functions in the partial-wave regime. We also discuss the limitations of the method and the cases in which our method can give a reliable result, while the method based on the structure functions can fail."}

We investigate the motion of the system for different initial conditions and in the presence of different types of trapping potentials. We also study the different ways in which an atom and ion can be combined to form a molecule. Our main results are: (i) We show that the system will always collide with the trapping potential in a way such that the total kinetic energy of the system remains constant. (ii) We show that the system can be made to perform a complete rotation about an axis perpendicular to the plane of the orbit even in the presence of a harmonic potential.

We use the fusion rules for the fundamental and the adjoint representation, and we show that the fusion rules are the same for the fundamental and the adjoint representation. This implies that the number of BPS operators in the fundamental and the adjoint representation is the same, which contradicts the result in the fundamental representation, and suggests that the fusion rules in the adjoint representation is wrong.\n\nWe consider the Poincar\u00e9 symmetry of the BPS operators. We show that the BPS operators can be classified by the Poincar\u00e9 symmetry. We find that the seven BPS operators in the fundamental representation which are not the BPS operators in the adjoint representation, and the three BPS operators in the adjoint representation which are not the BPS operators in the fundamental representation, form a continuous family under the action of the parity transformation. This suggests that these BPS operators are related to the half-BPS operators. We also find that the BPS operators in the fundamental and the adjoint representation have the same Poincar\u00e9 symmetry.\n\nWe study the three point function of the BPS operators.

{"text":"\nWe review recent results on thermal Casimir force between dielectrics and related problems. We first present an exact formula for the thermal Casimir force between two dielectric slabs in the limit of strong dielectric contrast, which is valid for any combination of dielectric materials. This exact formula has been obtained by using the fact that the Clausius-Mossotti relations can be derived from the equilibrium statistical mechanics in the presence of a magnetic field along the polar direction. We next show that this formula can be understood by using the concept of bound and unbound photons. We also discuss the extension of this formula to the case of a generalized dielectric, which is relevant for studying the thermal Casimir force between a dielectric and a conductor. We then present a formula for the thermal Casimir force between a dielectric and a conductor in the limit of large dielectric contrast, which can be understood by using the concept of bound and unbound photons as well.

{"text":"\nWe investigate the redshift and geometrical aspect of photons. We show that the redshift of a photon is given by the angle that the photon's propagation vector forms with the galaxies peculiar velocity. Hence, a photon is redshifted when its propagation is at an angle with the peculiar velocity. We also show that the photons' energy is related to the surface area that the photon's propagation vector sweeps out in the Hubble volume. We derive an expression for the energy of a photon in terms of the surface area that the propagation vector sweeps out. Our results suggest that the energy of a photon is directly proportional to the surface area that it sweeps out. We show that the surface area that a photon sweeps out is related to the square of its wavelength. Our results suggest that the energy of a photon is inversely proportional to its wavelength squared. We discuss the implications of our results for the energy conservation and for the explanation of the observed redshift of photons."}
{"text":"\n\nCool Stars in Hot Places\n\nWe present a study of the low-mass stars and brown dwarfs in hot, gas-rich galaxies. We derive fundamental parameters for a large sample of low-mass stars and brown dwarfs in the infrared sky surveys IRAS and 2MASS, in the regions of four galaxies: the Milky Way, the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, and the Andromeda Galaxy. We find that the low-mass stars in these galaxies follow the fundamental parameters of the thin disc population in the Milky Way, and are distinct from the thick disc and the halo. We therefore suggest that the low-mass stars in these galaxies are members of the thin disc, and have been stripped from their native galaxies by tidal interactions, possibly during the formation of the Magellanic Clouds. We find that the low-mass stars and brown dwarfs in the four galaxies have the same velocity distribution, and are thus likely to be members of the same population. We find that this population has a mean metallicity of [Fe\/H] \u2248 +0.2, which is intermediate between the metallicities of the thin disc and the thick disc in the Milky Way. We show that the observed metallicity distribution is consistent with a single population with a constant metallicity, and discuss possible physical mechanisms for producing this distribution. We find that this population has a low radius distribution: the median radius is only 1.5 R\u2299, with a mode at 1.1 R\u2299, which is significantly smaller than the radii of the thin disc and the halo in the Milky Way. We discuss the implications of these results for the formation history of these objects, and for the structure and evolution of the galaxies in which they are found."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a detailed analysis of the physical requirements for particle number in galactic bar-halo friction simulations. We show that the standard procedure of assigning a single number density to each galaxy, which is then used throughout the simulation, leads to an inaccurate representation of the galactic distribution. To remedy this, we propose a model in which the number density is allowed to vary smoothly within each galaxy. We show that this model is stable against the formation of large-scale structure, provided that the total number of particles is sufficiently large. We derive a simple expression for the critical number density that must be achieved in order to prevent the growth of large-scale structure. We then use this expression to analyze the results of a series of numerical experiments in which we vary the total particle number in a simple model of bar-halo interaction. We find that the resulting halo mass and shape are very sensitive to the particle number, and that the minimum particle number required to produce a satisfactory result increases sharply as the bar-halo interaction strength is increased. We also find that the addition of a small number of particles to an already gravitationally stable configuration can have a dramatic effect on the shape of the resulting halo. We discuss the practical implications of these results for the design of numerical experiments, and we suggest that the findings may have important implications for the interpretation of observational data."}

{"text":"\nWe introduce a new axiom, the axiom of temporal choice, which together with the axioms of time and symmetry, provides a rigorous foundation for the geometry of time. The axiom of temporal choice enables one to define a temporal square root of a time-like interval. We show that this temporal square root satisfies the axioms of a metric space, and hence we have a metric space which is a model of the axioms of time, symmetry and temporal choice. This new metric space has a natural structure of \" timelines \" along which \" events \" occur. We show that these timelines are equivalent to the psychological and neuro-biological concept of \" time \". We also show that any \" time \" interval, as perceived by a conscious being, can be uniquely expressed as a \" sum \" of a \" finite \" number of \" infinitesimal \" time intervals, and that this structure is consistent with the psychological and neuro-biological concept of \" time \". We show that the structure of our metric space enables one to define a time-like \" boundary condition \" for an \" event \", which is the analog of the momentum-like boundary condition for a quantum particle. This boundary condition, together with the metric structure of time, gives rise to a \" quantum \" version of time-like intervals. We show that the temporal square root of a time-like interval plays the same role in the geometry of time as the square root of a momentum-like interval plays in the geometry of space. Finally, we show that the temporal square root of a time-like interval is related to the psychological and neuro-biological concept of a \" moment \", and that it is the basic \" quantum \" of time."}

We also discuss the effect of an optional power law decay index n \u223c 1.3  \ud83e\udca0 1.4, which was reported in some recent observations, on our model. We show that this power law index can be accounted for if the density distribution has a double-power-law profile, with a power law index n \u223c 2.3  \ud83e\udca0 1.4 in the inner part of the isothermal region and a shallower index n \u223c 1.1  \ud83e\udca0 1.2 in the outer part."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate the excitation spectrum gap and spin-wave stiffness of chains of Ising spins in an XXZ Heisenberg antiferromagnetic material. We use the renormalization-group approach developed by Mostafa anduri for the calculation of the excitation spectrum of Ising spins on a square lattice. Our main results can be summarized as follows. (i) For an antiferromagnetic material with a narrow gap, the stiffness of a spin-wave mode is very large and the corresponding attenuation length is very small. This result is consistent with the strong increase of the stiffness observed in recent experiments on chains of antiferromagnetic spins. (ii) For an antiferromagnetic material with a large gap, the stiffness of a spin-wave mode is small and the corresponding attenuation length is large. This result is consistent with the small increase of the stiffness observed in recent experiments on chains of antiferromagnetic spins. (iii) We show that the stiffness of a spin-wave mode can have a maximum as a function of the frequency and that this maximum is close to the onset of a gap in the excitation spectrum. This result may be relevant for the interpretation of recent experiments on chains of antiferromagnetic spins."}
{"text":"\nWe consider the problem of finding a local minimum of a multivariate function F on a compact convex set K with nonempty interior, under the assumption that F is continuously differentiable on K and has one or more critical points in its interior. The behavior of the corresponding optimization algorithm is analyzed by means of the concept of conjugacy. In particular, we show that an appropriate choice of the step size in the algorithm can make it converge to the (nearest) degenerate saddle point in the interior of K, provided that F is not too badly deforming. The algorithm is simple, but the analysis of its behavior is non-trivial due to the non-smoothness of the optimization problem. We show that the algorithm can be guaranteed to converge to a critical point under certain assumptions, and that the assumptions are satisfied in a number of important practical cases. We also show that the algorithm can be improved by using the subspace geometry of the linear algebra problem corresponding to the optimization problem. The improved algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a critical point under slightly stronger assumptions than the original algorithm."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a statistical analysis of the detection of extra-solar planets in globular clusters. We derive the probability distribution for the number of planets around a random star in a globular cluster. This distribution can be used to derive the detectability of a given planet in a given globular cluster. We find that massive planets are on average easier to detect than small planets. This is because massive planets cause a larger radial velocity variation of the host star, and are more likely to be in a tight orbit that causes a large transit signal. We also find that planets in tight orbits are on average easier to detect than planets in wide orbits. This is because the close-in planets cause a larger transit signal and are more likely to be detected by the radial velocity method. We also consider the relative detectability of planets in globular clusters and in the field. We find that planets in globular clusters are on average easier to detect than planets in the field. We discuss this finding in the context of the formation of extra-solar planets, and the implications for the detectability of extra-solar planets in general."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider the possibility of the Majorana masses of neutrinos in CFTs with MSSM-like spectra being induced by the presence of a special class of non-perturbative instabilities, which we call \"instanton induced\". We show that this is possible provided that the relevant CFT has certain special properties, which are not universal and are only shared by a small number of CFTs. As an application, we consider the case of SO(10) with the simplest MSSM-like spectrum, and show that in this case the Majorana masses of the weakly coupled neutrinos can be induced by the unique combination of a single $N=1$ axial-vector current and a single $Z_2$ weak-singlet mode. We show that the Majorana mass of the active neutrino is related to the $Z_2$ weak-singlet mass, and that the three passive neutrinos are related to the $N=1$ axial-vector current. We evaluate the mass of the $Z_2$ weak-singlet in terms of the $N=1$ axial-vector mass and the Standard Model Higgs mass, and show that the Majorana masses of the neutrinos can be large, but are not necessarily so."}
{"text":"\n\nWe have developed a new method for computing the effective action in quantum field theory in the presence of a static point-like defect. The effective action can be viewed as the renormalization of the action function due to the presence of an additional non-abelian symplectic group in the theory. The main idea is to use the representations of the non-abelian symplectic group to control the renormalization. The method is very general and can be applied to any quantum field theory with a non-abelian symplectic group. We apply the method to the problem of a static defect in the presence of a non-abelian gauge group. The defect can be viewed as a solution to the spontaneous breaking of the symmetry group. We show that the effective action has a minimum as a function of the defect mass, and that the minimum can be understood in terms of the renormalization of the field theory. The renormalization function can be obtained explicitly, and the minimum can be found analytically. The method can be used to compute the effective action for any defect in the presence of a non-abelian symplectic group. The method can also be used to study the renormalization of the action function due to the presence of a non-abelian symplectic group."}
{"text":"\n\nWe investigate the capabilities of Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) to measure the fundamental parameters of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) resident in galaxies in the Local Volume, and determine the relative sensitivities of different LISA scientific instruments to these SMBHs. We consider the limitations due to the complex relativistic effects, and the universal modifications introduced by the finite speed of light. We evaluate the contribution of higher harmonics to the frequency reach of LISA, and show that they can significantly increase the accessible mass range for LISA. We find that the main limiting factors are the lack of sensitivity to low frequencies, and the possible artifacts introduced by non-linear effects. We propose a simple method to correct for the latter, and we show that after applying this correction, the non-linear artifacts are limited by the linear noise, and thus, become negligible. We conclude that LISA can potentially measure the mass, the spin, and the spherical harmonic coefficients of SMBHs with a reach several orders of magnitude larger than the one accessible to Earth-based observations, provided that LISA is sensitive to frequencies higher than a few Hz."}
{"text":"\n\nWe comment on the paper by Guseinov on the evaluation of the derivative of the non-relativistic interaction energy with the Coulomb interaction potential. The error in the proof of Theorem 1 is analyzed. A general formula for the derivative of the interaction energy is obtained. An estimate of the numerical value of the derivative of the interaction energy is obtained in terms of the Riemann zeta function. The explicit form of the derivative of the interaction energy is obtained in the case of the center of mass frame and the inertial frame. An application of the obtained results to the problem of minimizing the interaction energy between two particles is proposed. The formula for the derivative of the interaction energy between two particles, obtained in this work, has a simple geometric interpretation. The work done by one of the particles in the process of moving from the initial position to the final position can be represented in the interaction potential energy surface as a sum of two components: the work done by the external force and the work done by the interaction potential. An analytical formula for the work done by the interaction potential is obtained."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present multiwavelength observations of the shock wave launched by the 2014 Juno mission as it intersected the outskirts of the Tycho supernova remnant. The observations were made with the Subaru HDS instrument as part of the Workshop on Multiwavelength Studies of Supernova Remnants in collaboration with the SUBARU\/HiCIAO Subaru Chandra partnership. We find that the shocked gas is dominated by the hydrogen Balmer line, with a strength that varies with the square of the optical depth. This is consistent with an ionization structure in which the hydrogenic ions are nearly optically thick, while the metalic ions are optically thin. We show that a simple model in which the shock energy is deposited into the ionization structure according to the ionization balance in the pre-shock medium can quantitatively reproduce the observed spectral and temporal variations of the Balmer line. Our model also predicts a decrease of the shock strength with the square of the optical depth, in agreement with the observation. We discuss a physical mechanism that could produce this particular ionization structure in a supernova remnant."}

{"text":"\n\nWe present a systematic study of the properties of protostellar clusters in intermediate-mass (IM) star forming regions. We use the N-body code Gadget-2 to simulate the evolution of these clusters, from the collapse of the parent molecular cloud to the final disruption of the cluster by the emerging stars. We consider a wide range of initial conditions, such as different initial cluster sizes and masses, and study the effects of a variety of physical processes, such as mass segregation, gravitational instability and radiation. We find that the clusters reach a state of mass equilibrium within a few hundred thousand years, and that the dynamical evolution is very similar to that of low-mass clusters. However, due to the higher mass of the parent cloud and the longer lifetime of the clusters, IM clusters are much more massive at equilibrium than low-mass clusters. We show that this is consistent with the observed correlation between cluster mass and parent cloud mass in star forming regions. We also find that the fraction of the gas mass in the form of very small (d$\\sim$1 pc) clouds is higher for IM clusters than for low-mass clusters, which may explain the apparent excess of very small clouds in IM star forming regions."}
{"text":"\n\nWe show that the transitive powers of Young-Jucys-Murphy elements are central in several ways. First, we prove that any such element is contained in the join of the symmetric and transitive powers of any two elements, symmetric and transitive powers being two well-defined notions of powers of elements of a finite Boolean algebra which have been introduced in the literature in different contexts. As a consequence we deduce that any Young-Jucys-Murphy element is contained in the join of any three symmetric powers of elements, that is, in the symmetric power of the join of any three elements. In view of the fact that the symmetric powers form a complete subalgebra of the algebra of all powers, this means that any Young-Jucys-Murphy element is contained in the symmetric power of the join of any finite subset of the Boolean algebra. Second, we prove that any such element is contained in the intersection of the symmetric powers of any two elements. This in view of the fact that the symmetric powers form a subalgebra which is closed under finite intersections, means that any Young-Jucys-Murphy element is contained in the symmetric power of the intersection of any two finite subsets of the Boolean algebra. As a by-product of the transitive powers being central, we deduce several results about finite Boolean algebras which have not been stated in the literature."}
{"text":"\nWe study the spin dynamics of the $qqq$ wave function on the light front in the high-momentum limit of QCD. The $qqq$ state is found to have an almost purely torsional structure with a very small orbital component, and thus it is highly symmetric under the exchange of two quarks. The $qqq$ state is more tightly coupled to the meson than the $qq$ state, which implies that the $qqq$ state is more sensitive to the non-perturbative dynamics. We show that the $qqq$ state is highly unstable against the formation of a meson with the isospin I=1 and, therefore, it is not a bound state in the usual sense. In order to properly describe the dynamics of the $qqq$ state, we introduce the concept of a $qqq$ force, which is related to the $q$ and $q^2$ forces in a way similar to the way in which the $j$ and $j^2$ forces are related to the $q$ and $q^2$ forces. We find that the $qqq$ state is most stable when the $qqq$ force is smallest. This happens when the $qqq$ state is most tightly coupled to the meson and, therefore, when the orbital component is smallest."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present an analysis of the dependence of the estimated luminosities of the optically violent transient (OVT) sources ULX on spectral models. We derive a formal expression for the luminosity of a blackbody with an input power spectrum given by a parametrized form. The main contribution to the radiative energy budget is the reprocessing of energy from the optical to the infrared, due to the high extinction suffered by the transient optical emission. We show that the assumption of a fixed radius of the emitting region, which is a typical assumption in the analysis of transient phenomena, may introduce a significant bias in the derived luminosity, especially for sources with low optical luminosity and a power law spectral shape. We discuss this effect and propose a simple correction which may be applied to the usual formulation to derive the luminosity. The analysis is applied to a sample of 22 ULX sources with available spectral models, for which we also derived the parameters of the reprocessing kernel. The derived luminosities are found to be in agreement with previous estimates based on the observed optical luminosity, within the error bars."}
{"text":"\n\nWe study the consequences of a nonzero chemical potential for the structure and dynamics of the proton and lepton numbers in QCD in one dimension. We find that the nonzero chemical potential does not change the structure of the theory but leads to a slow evolution of the proton and lepton numbers which can be described by a single parameter. The evolution of this parameter is shown to be related to the evolution of the Heaven's algorithm for the recursive definition of the axiomatically defined weak flavor group $\\mathcal{W}$, and thus the theory is completely described by the dynamics of the single parameter. We show that this parameter can be related to the Jacobian of the non-Abelian Gauguin transform $\\dot\\mu^\\mu$ defined on the octet and quarkonia states, and thus is a measure of the dynamic symmetry of the theory. We discuss the difference of this approach from the conventional description of the nonzero chemical potential in QCD where the change in the proton and lepton numbers is related to the Killing generator of the unitary group $\\mathcal{U}$, and thus is a measure of the conserved Noetherian symmetry of the theory."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present photometric and spectroscopic data for massive stars in the LMC, obtained with VLT\/FLAMES. We use the latest version of the Starburst Model to study the evolution of their winds, in the framework of the Feedback in Turbulent Molecular Clouds (FBTM) project. We find that the mass-loss rate of massive stars depends on both the stellar mass and the metallicity of the stellar atmosphere. We derive a scaling law for the mass-loss rate as a function of stellar mass and metallicity. This scaling law is consistent with a non-equilibrium thermodynamics description of the wind, in terms of the aerodynamic drag coefficient. We show that the evolution of massive stars is in general unstable with respect to the triggering of intense mass-loss episodes. We derive a criterion for the onset of such events, which depends on the comparison of the internal temperature with the wind temperature. We show that massive stars tend to evolve in a rather unstable manner, with frequent changes in the mass-loss rate, possibly leading to major structuration in the surrounding medium. Our results are consistent with a triggering of mass-loss events by the instabilities of the convective core, due to the combination of the rotation and the magnetic field, and by the interaction with the surrounding medium."}
{"text":"\nWe present a comprehensive study of nucleon form factors in $ep$ and $\\nu p$ elastic scattering at high energy. Our aim is to search for structure beyond the Standard Model (SM) in the near-threshold region. We find that the $\\ep$-scattering cross section shows a clear structure at an energy slightly above the threshold, and the $\\nu p$-scattering cross section shows a structure in a large energy region slightly above the threshold. We show that these structures can be well described by a unified model in which the nucleon is bound to a new (heavy) neutral scalar particle (SP) with a mass around 1.5 GeV\/c^2. This SP has only one SP-nucleon bound state with a width slightly smaller than the $\\ep$-scattering threshold, and the SP-nucleon system has an excited state with a width slightly larger than the $\\nu p$-scattering threshold.

{"text":"\n\nWe present VIMOS-VLT spectroscopy of the giant Ly-alpha nebulae associated with three z~2.5 radio galaxies. We find that the gas in these nebulae is molecular and that two of the nebulae are associated with galaxies that contain a high fraction of cold hydrogen gas, while the third nebula is associated with a galaxy that contains a relatively low fraction of cold gas. This is consistent with the idea that the molecular gas in these nebulae was originally part of the intergalactic medium and has been attracted by the galaxies, possibly in association with the accretion of gas from the intergalactic medium that has occurred throughout galaxy formation and evolution. We estimate that the fraction of the total gas in these nebulae that is in the form of molecular hydrogen is between 6 and 13%. We also find that the far-ultraviolet continuum luminosity of the galaxies associated with the nebulae is a rough correlate of the mass of cold gas in the galaxies, consistent with the idea that the far-ultraviolet continuum emission is produced by the ionization of cold gas by bright stars. The fact that the luminosities of the nebulae are much larger than the ionization luminosity of the gas in the galaxies suggests that the gas in the nebulae is not simply a continuation of the gas in the galaxies, but has been accreted from the intergalactic medium. We estimate that the mass of gas in the three nebulae is 4.1 kpc$^2$, which is roughly one-third of the total gas in the three galaxies. The gas in the nebulae is moving at a velocity of $\\sim$70 km s$^{-1}$, and the total kinetic energy of the gas in the nebulae is $\\sim$9.6 kJ. We discuss the implications of our findings for models of giant molecular clouds and the formation of stars and galaxies."}
{"text":"\n\nWe study the illusion of control in minority and Parrondo games. We show that the illusion of control can be maintained in a minority game by means of a suitable randomization of the game's starting point. We also show that the illusion of control can be maintained in a Parrondo game if the randomization is performed on the moves rather than on the starting point. The main difference between the minority and Parrondo cases is that, while the minority game has a single Nash equilibria, the Parrondo game can have several, and the randomization must be designed in such a way that the illusion of control is maintained for all of them. We analyze the randomizations of the minority and Parrondo games by means of a suitable generalization of the concept of vertigo to random games, and we derive simple sufficient conditions for the randomization of the minority and Parrondo games that guarantee the maintenance of the illusion of control. We finally study the connection between the randomization of the minority and Parrondo games and the classical concepts ofrandomized retrospectively deterministic and stochastic games."}
{"text":"\n\nWe have developed a method of investigating the energy spectrum of the sources of gamma rays using an extensive air shower experiment. We utilized the nuclear trigger technique with a stack of multi-wire proportional counters to measure the longitudinal distribution of the electron shower simultaneously with the measurement of the lateral distribution by multi-channel detectors. From the energy distribution of the electrons at the shower core, we obtained the energy spectrum of the electron source. We found that the energy spectrum is well described by a power law with a cut-off at the lowest energies. We also obtained the energy spectrum of the hadron source from the lateral distribution of the hadrons. The energy spectrum is well described by a exponential distribution with a peak at the highest energies. We compared the energy spectrum of the hadron source with the results from the hadronization model of the relativistic heavy ion collisions and found that they are consistent within the experimental error. We also compared the energy spectrum of the electron source with the results from the relativistic ionization model and found that they are consistent within the experimental error. From the comparison of the energy spectrum of the electron and hadron sources, we conclude that the primary gamma rays are probably produced by the hadron source while the secondary gamma rays are produced by the electron source."}

The fluctuation-dissipation relation is also satisfied in the thermodynamic limit for the random initial condition. We also discuss the relation between our results and the recent results of R.

{"text":"\nWe present an analysis of the high latitude interstellar medium (ISM) based on a previously published census of the interstellar neutral hydrogen (H) structure in the local volume. We show that the high latitude ISM is both more complex and more massive than previously recognized. We present a model of the high latitude ISM that accounts for the observed distribution of H, the structure of the high frequency continuum (HFC) emission from the ISM, and the distribution of local molecular clouds. The model indicates that the high latitude ISM is composed of a large number of small clouds, with only a few having sizes larger than 10 pc. The HFC emission indicates that these clouds have high densities and temperatures. We estimate that the high latitude ISM has a total mass of 2.3 kpc$^{-2}$ and that the clouds account for 2.0 kpc$^{-2}$ of this mass. We discuss the physical properties of the clouds in the high latitude ISM and show that the temperatures are consistent with the idea that the clouds are small and not much colder than the background ISM. We estimate the total H content of the high latitude ISM to be 1.7 kpc$^{-2}$. We also discuss the global structure of the high latitude ISM and find that the high latitude ISM has a much more complex structure than previously recognized. The high latitude ISM is composed of at least 19 different cloud complexes with sizes larger than 1 pc, with the largest cloud complex (the Cygnus-A molecular cloud) having a size of 4 pc. The clouds are not distributed smoothly but are clumped together with large gaps between them. We discuss this structure in the context of a model in which the clouds are treated as isothermal and homogenous, with a simple prescription for the H distribution. We find that this model is consistent with the observations and provides a simple description of the high latitude ISM structure."}
{"text":"\nWe present a method to probe the electron density distribution in the solar corona using the off-limb observation of the solar photosphere. We utilize the fact that the sensitivity of the shape of the solar off-limb line profiles to the variation of the electron density distribution is different in the direction parallel and perpendicular to the solar limbs. Our method is based on the assumption that the off-limb line profile is insensitive to the variation of the electron density in the direction parallel to the solar limbs, while it is sensitive to the variation of the electron density in the direction perpendicular to the solar limbs. The assumption is valid if the electron density distribution is isotropic along the line of sight and if the effect of the temperature distribution along the line of sight is negligible. We show that the off-limb line profile can be used to probe the electron density distribution in the direction perpendicular to the solar limbs if the angle between the electron density gradient and the line of sight is known. We show that the off-limb line profile can be used to constrain the structure of the electron density distribution in the corona if the distribution is stratified along the line of sight. We discuss the implications of our results for the measurement of the solar electron density distribution with off-limb observations."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present photometric detections of 21 of the 22 SW Sextantis stars with well-determined orbital periods between 3-4 hours. The large majority of these CVs show the characteristic short-period evolutionary properties of the SW Sextantis stars: small-sized spots, high photometric precision, and a temperature-vibration relationship. The exception is HD 3 genetics, which has a relatively large spot and a temperature-ionization relationship. The properties of these CVs are consistent with a dominant population of SW Sextantis stars in the 3-4 hour orbital period regime. We estimate the orbital period distribution of the SW Sextantis stars in this range to be Gaussian with a width of 0.13 hours. We also present evidence that the group may be Complete Mitochondrial DNA (cmDNA) heterogenerous, based on the size-frequency distribution of the spots. If this is the case, the group may have formed through the accretion of satellites around the most massive member. \n\nWe find that the SW Sextantis stars with well-determined orbital periods between 3-4 hours have the same general properties as those with orbital periods between 5-6 hours, except that the latter are generally larger in size and have a higher surface gravity. We conclude that the SW Sextantis stars with orbital periods between 3-4 hours are the dominant population in that range."}

We also consider different conceptions of time, including the role of science, and the importance of the direction of time. In particular, we focus on the idea that time is a dimension, and on the idea that the dimension of time is relative to the observer. We then pose the question whether the beginning and end of time can be conceived as events in the history of the universe, and explore possible answers to this question. In particular, we focus on the role of the observer in the conception of time. We conclude that, although the beginning and end of time can be conceived as events in the history of the universe, they cannot be defined unambiguously, and that the question whether time has a beginning and an end is well-posed only if time is conceived as an absolute, independent of the observer."}
{"text":"\n\nIntroduction\n\nLight scattering methods are commonly used to analyze blood cells. A widely used light scattering parameter is the volume-equivalent diameter, which is obtained by measurement of the scattered light at low angles (Forward Scatter) with respect to the incident beam. This parameter is, however, not well suited for the analysis of fragile blood cells, such as elderly red blood cells (RBCs), which may be sensitive to mechanical stress. In this study, we present a new parameter, which we call the opacity, obtained by measurement of the scattered light at high angles (Side Scatter). The new parameter is more sensitive to the internal structure of the RBC, than the conventional Forward Scatter parameter.\n\nMethods and Results\n\nWe have performed experiments with a commercial flow cytometer, equipped with a high-speed digital signal processor, for simultaneous measurement of Forward and Side Scatter. RBCs from 3 healthy donors and 3 patients with microangiopathy were studied. The analysis was made on single RBCs, and the average values and standard deviations of the Forward and Side Scatter parameters were determined. In addition, the ratio of the Side Scatter to the Forward Scatter was calculated. A low ratio indicates an increased internal reflectivity, and is therefore indicative of a fragile RBC. The results show that the new Side Scatter parameter is capable of differentiating between healthy and fragile RBCs.\n\nConclusions\n\nWe have presented a new parameter, the Side Scatter, for characterization of RBCs. The new parameter is more sensitive to the internal structure of the RBC than the conventional Forward Scatter parameter, and can therefore be used for analysis of fragile RBCs."}
{"text":"\nWe propose a general lattice cosmology with a refining loop to investigate anisotropic cosmological models which are derived from an effective potential function with a cut-off function or a power-law tail. The main aim of this work is to study the behaviour of the standard model of cosmology on an anisotropic space-time in order to find a model which has a slow-roll or a Cosmological Constant (CC) type solution. Our model contains a extra parameter which is related to the anisotropy and we study the different values of this parameter to see if we can find a slow-roll solution or a CC solution. We find that if the anisotropy parameter is greater than a critical value, the model always has a slow-roll solution, and if the anisotropy parameter is smaller than the critical value the model has a CC solution for some values of the parameter and a slow-roll solution for the other values. If the anisotropy parameter equals the critical value, the model has a critical solution. In all cases the slow-roll or CC solution is a good approximation of the solution of the full model when the anisotropy parameter is close to the critical value. Moreover we show that if the anisotropy parameter is greater than the critical value the model has a Hopf bifurcation when the slow-roll solution is a good approximation of the solution of the full model.\nThe results of this work have some physical implications and they suggest some directions for future research."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate depletion effects in smectic phases of hard rod--hard sphere mixtures. The hard rods are represented by theYouthful model with anisotropic hard spheres in a simple cubic arrangement and the smectic phase is obtained by the addition of a quenching agent that acts to form a soft layer between the hard rod layers. We use a single parameter to describe the smectic texture, namely, the ratio of the soft to hard material in the mixture. We find that the smectic texture is very sensitive to this single parameter and that the texture undergoes a continuous evolution as the quenching agent is increased. The texture evolution has several interesting features. For a particular range of quenching agent concentration, the smectic texture is very compact, with hard rod layers almost completely isolated from each other by the soft material. We find that such a compact texture is only possible if the soft material is significantly more effective at quenching the hard rods than the solvent. At high concentrations of quenching agent, the texture becomes extremely loose and approaches a  smectic  phase of pure solvent with hard rods randomly distributed throughout. We find that such a loose texture is only possible if the quenching agent is significantly less effective at quenching the hard rods than the solvent. In both the compact and loose textures, the hard rods form a quasi-regular arrangement, with the long axis of each hard rod nearly parallel to the smectic layers. In addition, we find that the hard rods form an unusual core--shell structure, with the hard cores completely surrounded by a soft shell. The structure is stable with respect to changes in the solvent content. We also investigate the temperature dependence of the hard rod orientation in the smectic phase."}
{"text":"\n\nWe discuss the challenges for Minimal Supergravity Model (MSSM) Higgs searches at hadron colliders. We focus on the signature channel in which a Higgs particle with an MSSM mass can give rise to large rates of light quarkonia and Z\/W\/H+ pairs, which can be searched for using dedicated detectors. We show that the best case for MSSM (in which the MSSM mass is small and a large portal is achieved) is complementary to the direct search for a Standard Model Higgs at hadron colliders, in the sense that it can potentially probe a large part of the MSSM parameter space that is not accessible to the direct search. We also discuss the challenges for an MSSM Higgs search in the general case in which the MSSM mass is not small. We show that in this case the MSSM Higgs can produce large rates of Z\/W\/H+ pairs, but at the same time it is hard to distinguish these from the QCD background, and therefore dedicated detectors are needed to achieve a high level of sensitivity. We discuss the expected performance of various dedicated detector concepts, and we draw a general conclusion that the best prospects for a large sensitivity are achieved by combining many detectors of different types. We also discuss the challenge of explaining the large rates of Z\/W\/H+ pairs that are expected in the MSSM Higgs search, assuming that no MSSM Higgs is found. We conclude that the best explanation is that the MSSM Higgs is slightly hidden (for example, it is not a fundamental particle but a bound state of two or more Standard Model particles), and that the MSSM theory is actually a hidden local theory in which the MSSM Higgs is a pseudoscalar quarkonia that is slightly hidden by an inflaton, which is the only new heavy degree of freedom."}
{"text":"\nWe show that if a strong electromagnetic field is impressed on a plasma, a dense plasma lump can form with electric field penetrating its core and enjoying strong internal stability, thus behaves as a perturbative black hole. The surface of this plasma pudding is electrically conducting, therefore, it reflects the light just like a normal black hole with a conducting surface. We show that such a plasma pudding can be formed in a laboratory with a strong laser field, or in a space with a strong electric field created by two parallel conducting plates. We show that such a plasma pudding can be used to test the strong-field limit of the predictions of general relativity, and its behavior can be explained by a simple Amends-typhoon model without involving any black hole physics. We show that the same Amends-typhoon model can also explain the dynamics of a natural plasma pudding formed in a plasma fountain, and can make accurate prediction on the number of puddles in the fountain. We show that a dynamic magnetic field can also form a plasma pudding, and that such a pudding can be used to probe the magnetic field in the core of the pudding. We show that a plasma pudding can also be formed by a stationary electric field in a vacuum chamber, and that the pudding can be made to move by varying the strength of the electric field. We show that a combination of a static magnetic field and a static electric field can also form a plasma pudding, and that the pudding can be made to move by varying the strengths of the electric fields. We show that a plasma pudding can be used to trap a particle, and that a plasma pudding can also be used to reduce the energy of a particle."}
{"text":"\n\nWe propose a nonequilibrium-potential approach to the study of stochastic resonance in reaction-diffusion systems. Stochastic resonance is an interesting phenomenon, which is related to the ability of a dynamical system to amplify weak, random signals. We consider the problem of stochastic resonance in a simple reaction-diffusion model with a nonlinear potential. The analysis is performed by a combination of exact, semi-analytical methods and numerical simulations. We find that the dynamics of the model is characterized by two types of stochastic resonance: a conventional type, which is related to the Hopfield resonance, and an unusual, `` diffusion-controlled '' type, which is associated with a transition to a random Walk-like behavior. We also find a new type of behavior: a resonance-like enhancement of the response to a deterministic input, which is due to the presence of a strong, quadratic potential term in the dynamical equation. Our analysis shows that the different types of resonance are related to the symmetry of the potential function and to the way the resonance is excited. The results are explained in terms of a general theory of stochastic resonance, which is based on the concept of the nonequilibrium potential."}
{"text":"\n\nDistortion of Gravitational-Wave Packets Due to their Self-Gravity\n\nWe consider the distortion of a weakly nonlinear Gravitational-Wave (GW) packet as it propagates in a spherically symmetric self-gravitating object. We show that this distortion is related to the kinematic properties of the packet and the spherically symmetric self-gravity solution. By performing a Taylor expansion of the self-gravity solution, we can express the distortion in terms of the packet's center-of-mass velocity and the first and second derivatives of the self-gravity solution with respect to the amplitude. We show that the contribution to the distortion from higher-order terms in this Taylor expansion can be bounded by a constant, which depends on the packet's kinematic properties. This bound is independent of the radius of the self-gravitating object. In particular, it does not tend to infinity as the radius tends to zero. This bound can be used to predict the distortion of a weakly nonlinear GW packet as it propagates in a spherically symmetric self-gravitating object, regardless of whether the solution is known analytically. We also investigate the effects of eccentricity and nonsphericity on the distortion of GW packets. In particular, we show that the distortion is sensitive to the instantaneous aspect ratio of a nonspherical self-gravitating object, but it is not sensitive to the mean aspect ratio. We also show that the distortion due to the self-gravity of a spherically symmetric object is always less than the distortion due to the self-gravity of a nonspherical object with the same volume."}
{"text":"\nWe present a photometric study of the old main sequence turnoff (OMST) in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). We derive the cluster-galaxy luminosity ratio in different regions of the SMC. The field studied has a wide range in metallicities, with the highest metallicities in the direction of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). We find that the lowest metallicities are around log(Z\/Z\u2299) \u2248 1.5 and the highest metallicities are around log(Z\/Z\u2299) \u2248 1.8. The lowest metallicities are found in a region close to the LMC, and there is a trend for the metallicities to increase toward the center of the SMC. We find that the relative abundance of elements in the gas is well described by the relation [Fe\/H] \u2248 +0.6[Z\/Z\u2299]0.5, which is consistent with the solar abundance. We derive the cluster-galaxy luminosity ratio in the different regions of the SMC, and we find that the luminosity ratio is inversely proportional to the metallicity within the interval [Fe\/H] = +0.4 to +0.8. We discuss the implications of our results for the star formation history in the SMC. We compare our results with recent literature results."}

{"text":"\n\nWe investigate the effects of the noises' statistics and spectrum on noise-induced phase transitions in continuous-time systems. We consider a general model of an anti-phase correlated noise which can describe both additive and multiplicative noise processes. The analysis is based on the calculation of the real part of the noise correlation function, which is shown to have a simple expression in terms of the noise amplitudes and the correlation functions of the driving signals. We use this expression to study the effect of noise on the stability of an overdamped harmonic oscillator and the onset of deterministic chaos in a publish-favorite queue model. We find that the noise-induced phase transitions can be either enhanced or suppressed by the noises' spectrum and statistics. In particular, we show that the noise-induced transitions are more stable with respect to changes in the noise statistics in the case of a broadband noise. We also found that the chaotic behavior is more robust with respect to changes in the noise statistics in the case of a noise with a symmetric spectrum."}

{"text":"\nWe present an analysis of the properties of a sample of 22 intermediate-mass open clusters that retain some remains of their original gas-rich condition, as diagnosed by the presence of He-rich Wolf-Rayet stars. We found that the clusters in our sample are, on average, more distant, more metal-poor, and have lower gas fractions than a sample of 22 gas-rich clusters from the same region. We also found that the gas fractions of the clusters in our sample are inversely correlated with the total mass of the cluster, whereas no correlation was found between the gas fraction and the total number of cluster members. We conclude that the remains of gas-rich open clusters are the fossils of a large-scale evolutionary process that was first proposed by 1996ApJ...511..77S, in which the gas-rich clusters are expected to have evolved towards massive, gas-poor clusters. Our results suggest that this process is more efficient in removing gas from the clusters than the simple infall onto the clusters of the ambient matter, and that the mass of the infalling matter is only of the same order of magnitude as the mass of the gas that the clusters are able to retain. We discuss our results in the framework of the existing models for the evolution of gas-rich clusters."}
{"text":"\nWe propose a linear reformulation of the Kuramoto model of self-synchronizing oscillators. Our approach is based on a linear reading of the original nonlinear equations. We show that the linear system has the same qualitative behavior as the original nonlinear system, but the oscillators are driven by a linear potential instead of a square-wave potential. The analysis of the new system is much simpler and it has a simple and explicit form in the thermodynamic limit. In addition, the new system is equivalent to a single large oscillator, whose dynamics is exactly the same as the dynamics of the original Kuramoto model in the thermodynamic limit. We analyze the conditions that guarantee the transition from the linear regime to the nonlinear regime and vice versa. We show that this transition is a Hopf bifurcation, which is guaranteed by the coincidence of the frequency of the driving signal with the natural frequency of the oscillators. We analyze the influence of the initial conditions on the qualitative behavior of the system and we show that the transition from the linear regime to the nonlinear regime is sensitive to the initial conditions, in a way that depends on the symmetry of the initial conditions. In particular, we show that if the initial conditions are symmetric, the transition is guaranteed, while if the initial conditions are asymmetric, the transition can be prevented by an external force. This allows us to study the effects of symmetry breaking on the dynamics of the system."}
{"text":"\nWe present a detailed theoretical study of the electronic properties of carbon nanotubes calculated from density functional theory and the empirical pi-bond model. The motivation for this work is to provide a systematic evaluation of the electronic properties of carbon nanotubes that can be compared with the results of previous studies, which used a variety of different computational methods. Our results for the electronic structure, the density of states, and the electronic transport properties of carbon nanotubes are consistent with the results of previous studies, and provide additional insight into the electronic and structural properties of carbon nanotubes. In particular, we show that the charge transfer from the \u03c0-bond to the breathing mode is small, which explains the experimentally observed stability of the electronic structure of carbon nanotubes. We also show that the conductance of carbon nanotubes is very sensitive to the symmetry of the nanotube, and that the conductance is very large for nanotubes with a small number of walls. Our results suggest that the electronic transport properties of carbon nanotubes can be controlled by the geometry of the nanotube, and that it may be possible to design carbon nanotubes with desired electronic transport properties."}
{"text":"\n\nDeaconstructing Functions on Quadratic Surfaces into Multipoles\n\nWe consider the problem of decomposing a function on a quadratic surface in a projective space into a superposition of multipoles, that is, linear combinations of Dirac $\\delta$-functionals. We show that this is possible in the case of quadrics that are symmetric with respect to the projective plane. We describe the minimal basis of Dirac $\\delta$-functionals on the symmetric quadrics. Our approach is via the geometric structure of the symmetric quadrics in the projective space, which enables us to give a description of the resulting multipoles in terms of the geometry of the projective space. In particular, we show that the multipoles can be extracted from the restriction of the function to certain lines in the projective space. Our approach does not rely on the classification of quadratic surfaces, but rather uses a geometric description of the symmetric part of the quadric. As such, it provides a geometrically intuitive approach to decomposing functions on quadrics into multipoles."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a catalog of 3,67 \u00d7 10^3 extragalactic optical sources in a half-square degree survey of the North Ecliptic Pole region with Subaru\/SuprimeCam.

We have verified that our algorithm for detecting galaxy groups is not biased by the distribution of bright stars. This catalog is useful for studying large-scale structure, galaxy formation, and the relationship between the two.\n\nWe present an algorithm to detect galaxy groups in an optical image. We first use a Difference of Gaussians filter to detect galaxies, then use a nearest-neighbor algorithm to group the galaxies according to their spatial distribution, and finally fit a two-dimensional (2D) Kingman statistical graphical model to the galaxy positions to determine the number density of the groups. The number density of groups in our catalog is 3.01 \u00b1 0.01 groups per square degree, consistent with the number density of groups in the 2D universe, as obtained from large-scale structure surveys. This algorithm has several advantages: it is simple and efficient, it does not require an estimate of the background galaxy number density, and it is independent of the galaxy morphology or the survey method. Therefore, this algorithm can be applied to any galaxy catalog to extract groups."}
{"text":"\n\nThe kinematics and dynamics of the globular clusters and the planetary nebulae of NGC 5128\n\nWe present a kinematic and dynamic study of the globular clusters and the planetary nebulae of the face-on barred spiral galaxy NGC 5128. The stellar populations of the globular clusters have been derived using high-resolution spectroscopy obtained with the DEIMOS multi-object spectrograph on Keck Observatory. We have measured the orbital speeds of the globular clusters and found that they follow two different radial distributions. The inner clusters have average speeds of 75 km\/s and range from 52 to 86 km\/s. The outer clusters have average speeds of 55 km\/s and range from 44 to 69 km\/s. The difference in the speeds of the two populations is statistically significant (p < 0.001, Student's t-test) and implies that the two populations are not genetically related. We have also measured the orbital speeds of the planetary nebulae and found that they are higher than the globular clusters, ranging from 85 to 99 km\/s. The average orbital speed of the planetary nebulae is 87 km\/s. We conclude that the globular clusters and the planetary nebulae of NGC 5128 have dynamical origins different from each other. The globular clusters were probably born in the same manner as those in the Milky Way, while the planetary nebulae were probably born by the gravitational interactions of the globular clusters with the bar."}

These planets have minimum masses of 18.56, 14.66, 13.25, 11.88, and 9.83 MJup. These five planets were detected using a combination ofEVE\/Visible andIRTF data. We find that the detectability of these planets is helped by the fact that the host stars are slightly evolved intermediate-period K stars. We present an analysis of the detectability of such planets using a combination of archive and new data fromIRTF. We find that the sensitivity is dependent on both the host star's mass and its evolutionary state. We conclude that while planets of this size can be detected around solar-mass stars, the sensitivity is much better for slightly evolved intermediate-period stars. We discuss this detection technique in the context of theknown population of close-in giant planets, and in terms of planet formation theory."}
{"text":"\nWe have carried out a statistical study of the occurrence of giant pulses in the radio emission from the Crab pulsar. Our data are based on a complete monitoring campaign, with observations spanning three months for an accumulated on-source exposure time of \u223c105 days. We find that giant pulses occur with a recurrence rate of  \u223c0.36 Hz, that their duration and peak flux are correlated with the pulse phase, and that these correlations are consistent with a model in which giant pulses are produced by a stochastic process. We have derived the probability distribution for the peak flux and for the rise and decay times of the giant pulses, and used this to estimate the relative probability of occurrence of different categories of giant pulse. We find that the most likely category is that in which pulses rise and decay smoothly, but that there is a substantial probability that giant pulses will have a sawtooth shape, with rapid initial rise and decay. We also find that giant pulses may be absent for up to \u223c7 cycles in the radio emission, which corresponds to \u223c25 ms in the orbital period of the Crab pulsar. The observed statistics for the occurrence of giant pulses are consistent with a model in which the process that generates giant pulses is stochastic, with a probability distribution that is a function of the instantaneous phase of the radio emission."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a method to constrain the age and metallicity of stellar populations using colour pairs, that is, pairs of stars with nearly identical colours but different orbital properties. Colour pairs occur because the lines of sight to two stars of similar spectral type pass through different numbers of intermediate galaxies, resulting in differences in the colours of the stars as seen from Earth. We show that the differences in colour are proportional to the difference in the stellar population's age, with an accuracy of about 1 Gyr. We derive a simple analytic expression for the relation between colour and age, which can be used to constrain the ages of stellar populations in galaxies without the need for spectroscopic observations. We show that colour pairs can also be used to constrain the metallicity of stellar populations, with an accuracy of about 0.3 dex. We derive a simple analytic expression for the relation between colour and metallicity, which can be used to constrain the metallicities of stellar populations in galaxies without the need for spectroscopic observations. We show that colour pairs are not affected by dust in the intervening galaxies, and are therefore an effective way to study the evolution of stellar populations in galaxies in which dust obscuration is a problem, such as in elliptical galaxies."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a three-dimensional (3D) model of the dynamics of Jupiter and Saturn in the gaseous proto-planetary disk. We find that the orbit of Saturn is excited in a region between 4 and 8 AU, where the giant planet has its secular oscillations. Our model shows that the excitation is due to the resonance between the mean-motion of Saturn and the local gravitational instability caused by the holes in the disk. We estimate the growth rate of the disturbance at the edge of the hole and find that it is capable of explaining the secular oscillations of Saturn in the 3:2 resonance as well as the migration of the planetary system. We also estimate the precession frequency of Saturn's orbit and find that it is excited in the 7:2 resonance with the local gravity waves, which might explain the observation made by Cassini mission that Saturn's orbit is slightly inclined to the plane of the disk. We also show that the inner hole in the disk, together with the nodal constraints on the orbits of the giant planets, is able to produce the special configuration of the giant planets, with Saturn and Jupiter on the same side of the Sun. Our model suggests that giant planets can be formed in the disk even in the absence of a giant planet Population II, provided that there is a large-scale gravitational instability in the disk."}
{"text":"\nWe consider a kinetic theory for describing the thermodynamic and structural properties of binary granular mixtures at low density.

We observe that the kinetic theory predicts several interesting features of the thermodynamic and structural properties of the mixture, which are not captured by a simple mean-field theory. In particular, we find that the mixture is highly non-equilibrium, and that this non-equilibrium structure has a strong effect on the thermodynamic properties of the mixture. We also find that the mixture exhibits a strong dependence on the initial conditions, and that it can exhibit self-similar structures. We discuss the implications of our results for the understanding of the thermodynamic and structural properties of granular mixtures, and for the design of mixture processes."}
{"text":"\nWe present a detailed study of the population of double neutron stars in galactic globular clusters. We find a strong correlation between the properties of the pairs, in particular their orbital period and the orbital eccentricity, and the orbital period of the cluster's potential perturber, the galactic bar. We show that this correlation is consistent with a scenario in which the double stars form through the three-body interaction between two single stars and a passing giant molecular cloud, which may also be responsible for the cluster's dynamical instability. We argue that this scenario explains a number of previously observed properties of the double star population which were not well understood. We also present new high-resolution spectroscopy and photometry of several of the closest double stars, which enables a detailed comparison with model predictions. The agreement between the data and the predictions is excellent, and this provides strong evidence that our model is correct. Finally, we present new observations of a subpopulation of double stars which are very wide, and show that these objects are a mixture of wide double stars and close single stars. We explain this in terms of a resonance phenomenon in which the stars are forced into a particular alignment by the cluster's potential field. We predict that this population will exhibit a strong preference for certain orbital elements, and that this will provide a powerful tool for breaking the degeneracy between different formation mechanisms."}
{"text":"\nWe present a numerical study of the impact of feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the formation of disk galaxies in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. We find that the ionized gas in the outer parts of the disks is able to sustain an AGN feedback that is able to regulate the gas supply to the inner parts of the disk and thus affect the formation and evolution of the galaxies. We observe that the feedback from a single AGN is able to prevent the accretion of gas and thus the growth of a single galaxy, while it has no effect on the evolution of the large scale structure in the form of a galaxy cluster. We also find that the feedback from a number of AGN that are distributed on the same scale as the galaxies is able to affect the evolution of the large scale structure. Our results suggest that the feedback from the AGN is able to form a large scale structure in the form of chains of disk galaxies, and thus it has an impact on the evolution of the structure on the largest scales that can be described by a single simulation."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a multi-transition molecular line study of four candidate massive young stellar objects associated with methanol masers in the Orion Nebula Cluster. These objects were previously identified using optical and near-infrared photometry. We observed them in the J=1-0 and J=0-0 transitions of HCO^+(1->0) and in the J=1-0 and J=2-1 transitions of HCO^+(0->1) with the SCUBA camera on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope. We find that the HCO^+(1->0) line luminosity is higher than the HCO^+(0->1) line luminosity for all sources, consistent with the idea that the former is optically thick while the latter is optically thin. We estimate the HCO^+(1->0) line luminosity to be L_0 = 3.1 \\pm 1.3 \\times 10^36 erg s^-1, while the HCO^+(0->1) line luminosity is L_1 = 2.4 \\pm 1.4 \\times 10^36 erg s^-1. The HCO^+(0->1) line flux is strongly correlated with the HCO^+(1->0) line flux. A 1-dimensional analysis of the HCO^+(1->0) and HCO^+(0->1) line luminosities as a function of distance from the masers indicates that the sources are likely to bewithin 70 pc of the masers. A 2-dimensional analysis of the HCO^+(0->1) line flux as a function of ( projected) velocity indicates that the sources are likely to be at high velocity, consistent with a large-scale expansion. We discuss these results in the context of previous observations of the HCO^+(1->0) and HCO^+(0->1) lines toward low-mass young stellar objects in the same region."}

Our results show that a few countries, mostly rich countries, play very important roles in the world trade web. We find that the most important countries are not the ones with the largest gross domestic product (GDP) but the ones with the largest trade volume. We also find that the most important countries are not the ones that are located at the most central positions in the world trade web but the ones with the largest betweenness Centrality.

{"text":"\n\nWe present a theoretical study of the hydrogen 2p--2s transition as a probe of the epochs of recombination and reionization in the universe. We show that this transition is sensitive to the underlying quantum state of the hydrogen atom and therefore to the fraction of ionized hydrogen in the intergalactic medium. Our analysis demonstrates that the observed strength of the 2p--2s transition depends sensitively on the relative strengths of the 2p and 2s transitions in the previous epoch, suggesting that the strength of the 2p--2s transition can be used to trace the relative strength of the ionized and neutral intergalactic media. In particular, we show that the 2p--2s transition strength is small when the ionized fraction is small and that a substantial increase in the strength of the 2p--2s transition is expected as the ionized fraction increases. We show that a reasonable agreement between theory and observation can be obtained if the strength of the 2p transition is enhanced by a factor of approximately three over the strength in the neutral intergalactic medium. We discuss the implications of our results for the inference of the epochs of recombination and reionization from observations of the hydrogen 2p--2s transition."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a search for optically thick dust cores in the Vela Molecular Ridge Cloud D by combining near-infrared and far-infrared images obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope. We find seven core candidates, four of which are associated with the oxygen rich shocked molecular hydrogen sources in the region. One of these cores, in the source VMR D1, contains an optically thick core with a mass of about 15 M . The core is nearly axisymmetric and has a well-defined boundary. It is embedded in a much larger and more extended core of optically thin gas. We discuss this core in the context of models for the formation of massive cores and the termination of star formation in molecular clouds.\n\nWe present a new method for finding optically thick dust cores in molecular clouds. We search for the counterparts of the dust cores in the near-infrared and far-infrared. We find that the far-infrared images are best suited for this purpose because they are insensitive to small temperature variations in the gas. In the Vela Molecular Ridge Cloud D we find a strong correlation between the location of the shocked molecular hydrogen sources and the position of the optically thick cores. We present a model in which the massive cores are formed through the accretion of small cores along the streamline of the supersonic turbulence. The model predicts that massive cores will be found in association with the sources, as we observe in VMR D1. We discuss the implication of this model for the termination of star formation in molecular clouds."}
{"text":"\nWe propose a mechanism for the evolution of a neutral $K$ or $B$ meson from an incoherent to a coherent state. The evolution is motivated by the possibility of CP violation in the quark meson-antimeson system and is possible provided the quark-antiquark pair is not in a fully correlated state. The dynamics is described by a generalized Bloch-Weisskopf formulation which allows the evolution to be followed analytically. The resulting evolution is one where the states of the meson-antimeson system are a continuum of their statistical mixtures, with the state moving from a highly incoherent state at early times to a highly coherent state at late times. We also propose a possible physical mechanism for the transition from an incoherent to a coherent state which involves the destruction of the incoherent state and the subsequent creation of a coherent state. We find that the evolution is such that the final state of the meson-antimeson system is not in a fully coherent state, but is rather in a state where the coherency is suppressed by a finite random phase factor. We show that this state can be described by a formalism which we call an \"arrow of time\"."}
{"text":"\n\nWe investigate the statistical properties of the filling factors in competitive repulsive RSA from binary mixtures. We show that the standard deviation of the filling factors can be expressed as a function of the average number of occupied voxels, the total number of voxels, and the number of pixels in the image. Our results indicate that the fluctuations of the filling factors increase with the average number of occupied voxels and the total number of voxels, and decrease with the number of pixels in the image. The behavior of the standard deviation is consistent with the fact that small filling factors tend to occur in small areas while large filling factors tend to occur in large areas. Our analysis also shows that the empirical distribution of the filling factors has a heavy tail, which implies that the standard deviation increases with the average filling factor. Finally, we present a simple model that describes the statistical properties of the filling factors in competitive repulsive RSA from binary mixtures."}
{"text":"\n\nInfrared High-Resolution Spectroscopy of Post-AGB Circumstellar Disks. I. HR 4049 - The Winnowing Flow Observed?\n\nWe present high-resolution spectroscopy of the HR 4049 disk, obtained with the infrared spectrum analyzer ISAAC at the VLT. We have resolved the disk spectrum into ten separate components. Three of these components, all of them at about the same redshift, are likely to be the signatures of the winnowing flow. The total ionized gas is a blue-shifted reflection of the disk spectrum, which implies that the gas temperature is lower in the inner region of the disk. The ionized gas is probably the gas evaporated from the inner disk, and it is probably flowing outward along with the rest of the disk material. We find that the ionized gas has a much higher gas mass fraction than the disk. This might imply that the gas is much more efficiently ionized in the inner region than in the outer region. We discuss this finding in the framework of a simple model in which the gas ionization is proportional to the gas density. We also derive the gas density distribution in the disk, and discuss the mass distribution in the disk. We find that the disk mass is rather well described by the inverse-binomial distribution, with a power of -1.5. This is consistent with the disk being governed by the turbulent mixing. We also find that the disk mass is well described by a power law, with a power of -2.3. This is consistent with the disk being governed by the gravity instability."}
{"text":"\nWe have performed systematic measurements of the thermal and thermomechanical response of single crystals of the Ni50Mn34In16 magnetic shape memory alloy in a magnetic field applied along the easy axis of magnetization, at temperatures near and below the martensitic transition temperature, in the mixed-phase region. We found that the thermal and thermomechanical properties of the martensite phase, such as the specific heat and the elastic constants, are enhanced by magnetic field applied along the easy axis of magnetization. The change in the specific heat is found to be due to the adiabatic magnetization. We also found that the thermal expansion coefficient along the easy axis of magnetization is reduced due to the formation of the martensite phase, and the reduction increases with the increase of the magnetic field. We explain the enhancement of the thermomechanical properties of the martensite phase by the increase of the internal magnetic field in the martensite phase by the adiabatic magnetization."}
{"text":"\n\nSN 2003du: 480 days in the Life of a Normal Type Ia Supernova\n\nWe present a detailed study of SN 2003du, a normal Type Ia supernova (SN) during the first 480 days after explosion. This is the most complete study of the evolution of a normal Type Ia SN to date, based on spectroscopy and photometry of the supernova (SN) itself as well as images of the pre-explosion star obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope. We find that the accretion phase lasted for a relatively long time, at least 180 and possibly as long as 250 days. The observed phenomenology is consistent with a smoothly increasing accretion rate that suddenly drops to zero at some point in the last 10-20 days before explosion. We also observe a slow rise in the temperature of the hydrogen-rich envelope after the accretion phase, which may imply a constant accretion rate during this period. We find that the mass of the hydrogen-rich envelope is 4.2 solar masses, which implies that a substantial fraction of the star's initial envelope was accreted during the life of the donor star. The observed phenomenology is consistent with a donation model in which the accretion rate is simply proportional to the mass of the donor star. We discuss several observations that shed light on the properties of the supernova mechanism and the properties of the progenitor star."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a detailed study of the mass outflow and infall history of a sample of massive star forming regions (MSFRs) selected to have low-mass companions and to be free of any strong ongoing mass accretion or outflow. We determine the accretion and outflow history of each region by modeling the gas kinematics in the flow as a function of radius and evolutionary time. We find that infalling gas comprises a significant fraction (up to 70%) of the gas mass in these regions, with a typical accretion timescale of  \u223c 50 Myr. This is several times longer than the main star's lifetime, indicating that accretion must have been episodic. We further show that the accretion rate has a strong correlation with the stellar mass of the main star, but is only weakly correlated with the accretion history of the companion. We discuss several possible physical mechanisms that could drive such episodic accretion, including the gravitational influence of the companion, stellar pulsation, and hydrodynamic interactions. Our results suggest that massive accretion events may be more common than previously thought, and that they can have a significant impact on the properties of these young stars and their planets."}
{"text":"\nWe introduce a formalism that allows one to evaluate the probability of resonance saturation in large-Nc QCD. Our approach is based on the combination of the Riemann-Zielstra algorithm for resonance decomposition and the method of quickest detection of a secular evolution. The main ingredient of our formalism is a criterion that relates the evolution of the sucked-in mass with the energy deposition. In our picture, a resonance is saturated when the energy flux per unit mass, which is related to the rate of change of the sucked-in mass, exceeds a critical value. This formalism is exact and does not rely on any fitting parameters. We show that this criterion is consistent with the behavior observed in heavy ion collisions, in particular the structure of the matter created in the collisions, the data on strange hadron pairs, and the theory of heavy quarkonia. The predictions of our theory can be tested by analyzing the data on the hadron content of the jets produced in heavy ion collisions, which is currently being collected by the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and is expected to be collected by the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in the future."}
{"text":"\nWe present a first-principles study of the effects of structural instabilities on the magnetic properties of perovskite biferroics. We consider four different types of structural instability which can be captured by the Stillinger-Gr\u00fcneisen, Taylor, Cosmolly and Anti-phase domains models. We find that in all the cases the magnetic properties are significantly affected by the structural distortion, but the nature of this effect is very different in the various systems. In some cases the structural distortion has a large impact on the magnetic properties and can be used to achieve unique effects like a giant Barkhausen effect or a very large and fast switching of the magnetic susceptibility. In other cases the structural effect is small and has a small impact on the magnetic properties. We also find that the nature of the magnetic ordering is affected by the structural instability. In particular we find a strong effect on the kind of magnetic ordering which is stabilized over a wide range of temperatures. We also find a strong effect on the internal magnetic fields which are induced by the magnetic ordering. Our results suggest that in all the cases the structural instability and the magnetic instability are tightly coupled and that the structural instability can be used to achieve unique magnetic properties."}
{"text":"\nWe study numerically the dynamics of a Keplerian disc orbiting a near-extreme Kerr black hole (BH) in the presence of a large Newtonian reservoir (LNRF). We show that such a disc can undergo a velocity hump instability, leading to oscillations of the disc's inner edge. We derive a simple analytical expression for the frequency and the amplitude of these oscillations as a function of the disc's initial conditions and the LNRF's parameters. We show that these oscillations can be excited by a small perturbation applied to the disc's outer edge and that they decay if the perturbation is applied to the inner edge. The decay length is derived analytically and it increases with the amplitude of the perturbation. We discuss the physical mechanisms that may give rise to such a perturbation and we suggest that the disc's response to such a perturbation may explain the high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) observed in the inner accretion disc of the low-mass X-ray binary GRS 1915+105."}
{"text":"\nTwo-way coupling of FENE dumbbells with a turbulent shear flow\n\nWe consider a system consisting of a viscous incompressible flow in a channel and a distribution of small FENE dumbbells (which interact via a pairwise interaction potential) resting on the channel bottom. The motion of the dumbbells is two-way coupled with the flow in a turbulence-like fashion. We investigate the statistical properties of the system as well as the motion of single dumbbells. We show that this two-way coupling can have a significant effect on the behavior of the system as a whole, as well as on the motion of individual dumbbells. In particular, the system can display a range of different dynamical behaviors, from a steady state to unidirectional motion and even chaos. We also analyze the role of the following parameters: the spatial distribution of the dumbbells, the interaction strength, the Reynolds number, and the dimensionality of the problem. Our results could have implications for the dynamics of particles in a turbulent flow and in general for the understanding of the role of pairwise interactions in the context of turbulence."}
{"text":"\nWe propose a model with a Z' symmetry group and two families of light-like fermions, one of which is related to the usual Z and the other to the Z' operator.

The model is an extension of the hidden local symmetry model and contains two generations of hidden local symmetry fermions. In addition to the usual suspects, the quarks and the charged leptons, we include two families of hidden local symmetry fermions with the same masses as the up and down quarks and the electron and the muon, respectively. The gauge bosons are related to the Z and Z' operators in the same way the Z and Z' bosons are related in the hidden local symmetry model. We show that the model is invariant under a general coordinate transformation which relates the hidden local symmetry fermions to the quarks and charged leptons. The model generates a Z' symmetry group which may be related to the hidden symmetry behind the strong interaction. The quarks and charged leptons are related to the hidden local symmetry fermions by a general coordinate transformation which can be implemented by the transformation which relates the Z and Z' bosons in the hidden local symmetry model.

{"text":"\n\nWe consider a random graph coloring model in which the probability of any edge being present is independently and uniformly distributed on the set {0, 1\/2, 1} and examine the equilibrium probability of having a given number of edges colored in color 1. We show that this probability is the same as for a uniformly random graph, thus extending a result of basil. We also consider the problem of approximating the probability of this equilibrium in a random graph by a random walk on the graph. We show that this approximation does not work in general, but it does for a large class of graphs. We analyze this random graph coloring model in several ways. In particular, we consider the distribution of the number of edges of a given color, the distribution of the number of connected components of a given color, and the distribution of the number of non-zero degree vertices of a given color. We show that the last two of these distributions are related to the distribution of the number of connected components of a given size. We also show that the distribution of the number of edges of a given color can be approximated by a random walk on the graph. We then consider the random graph coloring model on a large class of graphs that includes the Barab\u00e1si-Albert and power law random graphs. We show that on these graphs the distribution of the number of edges of a given color converges to a limiting distribution that is independent of the number of colors.

{"text":"\n\nParametric Learning and Monte Carlo Optimization\n\nThe problem of learning the parameters of a model from data is considered. The model is assumed to be a black box that maps input variables to output variables according to some unknown functional relationship. The standard approach to this problem is to use an optimization algorithm to search the parameter space for a configuration that minimizes a loss function that measures the discrepancy between the model's predictions and the data. The algorithm is typically guided by a derivative-based optimization method that makes use of the differential properties of the loss function. This approach is limited to cases where the optimization algorithm can be expressed in a differentiable form and where the loss function can be evaluated at all points in the parameter space. These restrictions may not apply in practice. As a result, a number of approaches have been proposed that are based on heuristic search rather than optimization. These approaches suffer from the lack of a formalism for guiding the search process. In this work, a new method is proposed for learning the parameters of a model that combines the advantages of optimization-based and heuristic approaches. The proposed method makes use of a parametric learning strategy that is formalized using a Bayes-like decision theory. The proposed method is demonstrated on the problem of learning the parameters of a mixture distribution model and a nonlinear regression model. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method can achieve significantly better performance than heuristic search techniques, while maintaining the benefits of a formal optimization-like framework."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a study of the structure and properties of differentially rotating main-sequence stars in the 1-2 M_sun range. Our sample consists of eight stars that exhibit rotation-temperature relations with differential rotation factors ranging from below 1 to about 10. We determine the fundamental stellar properties via photometry from the Two Micron All Sky Survey, and we use high-resolution spectroscopy from the Hobby-Eberly Telescope to measure the projected rotational velocity. We find that the rotation-temperature relation is well described by a two-parameter relation in which the rotational velocity is proportional to the square of the effective temperature, with a proportionality constant that depends on the stellar mass. We determine the proportionality constant for each star in our sample by fitting the rotation-temperature relation to the evolutionary tracks in the 2013 version of the effective temperature-mass (Te-M) diagram. We find that the proportionality constant increases with increasing stellar mass. In the 1-2 M_sun range, the proportionality constant ranges from about 1.1 to 1.3. This result is consistent with theoretical models in which the internal structure of differentially rotating stars is described by a simple onion-like structure. We also find that the projected rotational velocity is well described by a power law in which the power law index decreases with increasing stellar mass. In the 1-2 M_sun range, the index of the rotational velocity power law ranges from about 1.1 to 0.9. The index is slightly higher for stars with rotation factors above 4, suggesting that the distribution of mass in these stars is not perfectly spherically symmetric. Our results imply that differentially rotating main-sequence stars are not rotating solid bodies, but rather are composed of a fluid core and a surrounding envelope, with a substantial fraction of the mass in the envelope."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a systematic study of the turbulent mixing in the surface layers of accreting neutron stars. Our motivation is the basic question of how efficiently the accretion energy is deposited into the star's internal structure, as this is the fundamental process that drives the evolution of the star. We focus on the case of low-mass X-ray binaries, where the accretion is typically much less efficient than in the more massive X-ray binaries. We consider the simple case of a stratified accretion flow, with a constant bulk viscosity and an exponentially decreasing temperature with the distance from the star. We find that the resulting mixing is consistent with the assumption of a rigid bulk, with the only degree of freedom being the temperature. We vary this parameter and study the influence of the temperature structure on the mixing. We find that the most efficient way to mix the accretion energy into the star's interior is with a temperature structure that has a minimum value in the outer parts of the star, in the region where the accretion is taking place. We discuss our results in the framework of recent observations of low-mass X-ray binaries."}

{"text":"\nWe present a multiwavelength study of the exceptionally extended flaring activity in the X-ray afterglow of GRB 050730, a gamma-ray burst with one of the longest known afterglows. We find that the afterglow emission is composed of several components with different properties. The longest-lasting component is a bright, steady source, which we identify as the interaction of the GRB 050730's afterglow with the local medium. This component accounts for about one-half of the total X-ray emission, and its temperature is several times lower than the temperature of the burst's afterglow. The interaction component has a much larger extent than the burst afterglow, and is responsible for the exceptional flaring activity observed during the first 5 ks. A 1-ks transient and a 5-ks transient are also present in the afterglow, and they have similar temperatures as the burst afterglow, but with different properties. We also present a detailed temporal analysis of the burst afterglow and the interaction component, and find that the interaction component's flaring activity is in phase with the same-frequency noise in the burst afterglow. We interpret this as the interaction of the burst afterglow with the local medium, which causes the exceptional flaring activity in the interaction component."}

This cluster contains several massive stars with a few embedded protostars. The cluster is surrounded by a possibly warm envelope. Our data suggest that this cluster is in a very early phase of its evolution. We discuss the origin of the massive stars and of the embedded protostars. The youngest stellar objects are probably associated with the youngest massive stars. The most massive star in the cluster is very active and may have a mass of $25 M_{\\odot}$. We have detected an extended arcade of brilliant knots in the cluster. This arcade may be the remains of the violent formation of the massive stars. The massive stars are very young, with an age of $3-5 \\cdot 10^{4}$ years. The lifetime of massive stars is very long, of the order of $10^{5}$ years. Therefore, the massive stars in this cluster have not yet reached their main-sequence evolution. We find a cluster mass of $1.2 \\cdot 10^{4} M_{\\odot}$. The cluster contains a large amount of gas, about $1.4 \\cdot 10^{4} M_{\\odot}$. We discuss the possibility that the embedded protostars are formed in an accretion process of gas from the massive stars. The gas kinematics is probably influenced by the massive stars. Our results are consistent with massive stars and embedded protostars being formed together."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present photometric observations of the SW sex-type nova-like outburst of the black hole Lyncis. The observations were carried out with the 1-m telescope at Waking Girl Observatory between January 31 and February 8, 2002, covering a time baseline of 8 days. We find a decline in the photometric amplitude of about 0.6 mag in quiescence and a much faster decline of about 2 mag in outburst. This result is consistent with a radiative transfer model in which the accretion disk is viewed through a hot inner boundary layer. Our data are consistent with a model in which the accretion disk is geometrically thick, with a scale height of about 2-4 rg, where rg is the radius of the gravity source. We estimate the mass of the accretion disk to be Mdisk = (1.5-3) x 10^25 kg, and the mass of the companion star to be Mstar = 1.7 x 10^25 kg. The mass ratio is therefore about 1:1, in agreement with previous estimates. We conclude that the accretion process is inefficient, with an accretion efficiency of less than 1 percent. Our data do not support the presence of a hot spot on the accretion disk, but we cannot rule out a highly eccentric orbit with many radiative artifacts. We discuss our data in the framework of various theoretical models."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider the problem of jointly designing the antenna arrangement and the transmission strategy for the downlink of a multi-antenna system (MAS) in order to maximize the throughput. We propose a general framework that is suitable for both the independent and joint design of the antenna arrangement and the transmission strategy. For the case of independent design, we consider the maximum-throughput problem for both the conventional (e.g., spatial multiplexing) and the generalized (e.g., space-time coding) MAS, and develop a general technique to solve it. This technique is based on a joint design of the antenna arrangement and the transmission strategy. Within this framework, we derive a closed-form expression for the maximum throughput for the case of the conventional MAS, and show that, by employing a carefully designed antenna arrangement, one can achieve a throughput that is close to the channel capacity, regardless of the number of transmit antennas. In the case of the generalized MAS, we obtain an expression for the maximum throughput in the presence of a constraint on the number of antennas. Our results show that, by employing a carefully designed antenna arrangement, the throughput can be improved significantly, even if the number of antennas is relatively small."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider a system of stochastic heat equations with multiplicative noise. The solution of the system is a random process, whose probability distribution is calculated. This distribution has a strong dependency on the initial conditions, in a way very similar to the one displayed by the solutions of the Cauchy problem for a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations. For a large class of initial conditions, this distribution has a heavy tail, with a finite number of local maxima. The probability that the solution stays in a small neighborhood of a given value decreases quickly as this value is approached from either side. In particular, the probability that the solution hits a given value from above or below is very small. For a particular choice of the initial conditions, the distribution of the solution is a mixture of two distributions, one with a large number of local maxima, and the other with a large number of local minima. The probabilities that the solution passes from one type of solution to the other are very small."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present the second part of a two-part study of the gas content of 29 bright early-type stars in the solar neighbourhood, selected from the ESO Proper Motion Survey (ESO-POP).

In this part we present a systematic search for intermediate and high velocity clouds using absorption lines of the CO molecule. We find that four of our stars (including the Sun) are clearly associated with such clouds. In the case of two of these clouds, the association is very strong, and the clouds are probably part of the Local Bubble. We find that the CO lines are rather weak and uncertain, and we were unable to identify clouds around several of the stars with strong molecular hydrogen lines. We discuss our non-detections in the light of various models, and suggest that (i) a substantial fraction of early-type stars may be associated with high-velocity clouds, (ii) these clouds may be relatively small, and (iii) high-resolution molecular line surveys are probably the best way to search for such clouds."}
{"text":"\nWe report a systematic investigation of the strength and specificity of the interaction between graphene and the four major DNA nucleobases, performed using a combination of density functional theory calculations and experiments.

The largest change in the C\u2013H\u22ef\u03c0 interaction energy upon base adsorption is found to be the main reason for the decrease in the strength of the interaction in the order G>A>T>C. Our results suggest that the strength of the interaction between graphene and nucleobases is not sufficient to form a stable hybrid in which the base would be covalently bound to the graphene sheet. We also show that the selective interaction between graphene and adenine is caused by the large change in the C\u2013H\u22ef\u03c0 interaction energy, in addition to the van der Waals interaction, and is not due to a unique molecular property of adenine."}
{"text":"\nWe present a panoramic imaging survey of the stellar halos in the galaxies of Andromeda (M31) and Triangulum (M33), a pair of giant spiral galaxies in the Local Group. We find that the stellar halos of both galaxies aredominated by the repeated accretion of dwarf galaxies, whose orbits are controlled by the gravity of the giant galaxies. In the case of M33, we have discovered a chain of 16 accretion events, a number that increases to 37 if the satellites in the widest orbits are included. These satellites show a well-defined correlation between their orbital speeds and distances, indicating that the accretion events are governed by the viscous evolution of the satellite clouds. We have identified the galaxies that were involved in the accretion events and determined their orbits. We have also estimated the mass of the accreted satellites and compared it with the theoretical predictions of the galactic encounter problem. Our analysis reveals that the observed accretion events are consistent with the repeated accretion of satellites with masses between 10^8 and 10^9 M_(\u2299), and that the encounter problem can successfully explain the origin of the observed structure in the stellar halos of M33. In the case of M31, we have discovered four main accretion events, and the interpretation of these events requires an additional mechanism to explain the exceptional concentration of mass in the western half of the galaxy. We discuss several possibilities, including the possible contribution of supermassive black holes to the dynamical evolution of the stellar halos."}

{"text":"\n\nWe present a method to identify dark matter (DM) burners in the galactic center, based on the analysis of the DM distribution in galaxies in the Local Volume. We select galaxies within 80 Mpc that have DM masses within 20% of the Milky Way's, and with face-on orbits. We find a correlation between the total DM content and the distribution of DM in the inner 10 kpc, with a power law index of -0.8. We show that this correlation is consistent with a model in which the inner 10 kpc is occupied by a spherical halo with a peak DM density of $2.3 \\times 10^{-3}$ GeV$^{-2}$. The mean distance to the center of this spherical halo is 6.4 kpc, which corresponds to the inner boundary of the Galactic bar. We conclude that the dominant process of DM burning in the Galactic center is the accretion of DM-laden gas clouds from the inner halo, and that the main accretion shock is located at the inner boundary of the bar. We estimate that $0.5 \\times 10^{12}$ DM kg-1 is accreted by the Galactic center per Myr, which is equivalent to a mass flow rate of 1.6%. This mass flow rate is an order of magnitude higher than the loss rate due to DM-hole formation in the Galactic disc, and implies that the Galactic DM fraction has been reduced by $\\sim 5 \\%$ since the accretion process started.

We consider a basic model consisting of a burst with a hard spectrum, a cut-off power-law and a exponential cutoff at the high energy end, in a uniform and homogenous interstellar medium. We solve the diffusion equation for the neutrinos in a spherical shell, that describes the burst, in the presence of a sink at the center. We determine the critical density of the medium, above which the burst is unstable, and the critical distance from the burst, below which the burst is unstable. The study is made for different values of the burst spectrum parameters and the density of the interstellar medium. We find that for realistic values of these parameters the burst is unstable at a large volume around the burst. The critical distance depends weakly on the density of the medium. We discuss the relevance of our results for different scenarios, such as the burst from a supernova (SN) or a giant flare on a magnetar. For SNe our results show that the neutrinos can travel a large distance before they are completely thermalized, provided that the burst is hard enough. For magnetars our results show that even if the burst is not hard, a large number of neutrinos will be thermalized in the inner few stellar radii."}
{"text":"\nWe have developed a model for the diffuse emission from the interstellar medium in the Milky Way and adjacent galaxies, based on a synthesis of published observations of HFFAR, the GLAST Lunar Libya survey, and the GLAST Chandra Deep Group Survey. We describe a method to derive a fit to the observed emission as a function of radius, and show that the model can accurately reproduce the observed properties of the diffuse X-ray emission in the Milky Way and in the Local Group galaxies. The main result is a model that describes the diffuse X-ray emission in the Milky Way and the Local Group galaxies, and that can be used to extract the physical parameters of the interstellar medium in these galaxies. We find that the diffuse X-ray emission in the Milky Way and in the Local Group galaxies is well described by a single power law with acutoff at 1 kpc. The value of the power law index is found to be -0.75+\/-0.01 for the Milky Way and -0.81+\/-0.02 for the Local Group galaxies, and the corresponding gas densities are 1.7+\/-0.2 kpc and 1.1+\/-0.2 kpc, respectively. We discuss the accuracy of the model and the associated errors, and we extract the main physical parameters of the interstellar medium in the Milky Way and the Local Group galaxies."}
{"text":"\n\nPrompt Emission of High Energy Photons from Gamma Ray Bursts\n\nGamma ray bursts (GRBs) are the most energetic form of electromagnetic radiation observed in the universe, producing energies that are thought to be capable of producing effects in the atmosphere of even the most distant galaxies. The physical mechanisms responsible for GRB emissions are not completely understood, and the prompts, or immediate emission of high energy photons, that accompany some GRBs are particularly poorly understood. We have developed a new method for analyzing the prompt emission from GRBs. Our method utilizes a combination of the inherent time structure in the data and the distribution of energy deposited in the detectors to identify and separate the prompt emission from the bulk of the GRB emission. Our new method has two key advantages: it is sensitive to a wider range of energy deposits and it is more robust to noise. We present here the first complete analysis of the prompt emission from the complete sample of long duration GRBs observed by the Burst Alert Telescope (BAT), and show that our new method is more effective at extracting the prompt emission than previous methods. We find that the BAT data are consistent with a simple model in which the prompt emission is due to a single pulse that fully isotropically radiated in the first few nanoseconds, followed by a slowly evolving, partially isotropic, emission that continues for the remainder of the burst. We show that this simple model is consistent with a range of burst durations, energies, and spectral shapes. This new method will be useful for extracting prompt emission from other GRB datasets."}

We evaluate the impact of the resummation of the Higgs and Z bosons, and of new resonances, on the production cross section, and we formulate the related open questions. We also review the status of the searches for the baryonic and leptonic resonances which are expected to be relevant for the determination of the Higgs mass, and formulate the open questions. We then focus on the two main experimental challenges which have been identified: the development of a powerful and reliable trigger, and the construction of a fully integrated detector. We formulate the related open questions, and we review the status of the ongoing R&D activities. We finally formulate the key scientific questions which remain open, and which should be addressed in the future."}
{"text":"\n\nWe have developed a new method to predict the future evolution of solar activity in near-term (up to one century) and long-term (up to several centuries) time frames. The method is based on the identification of repetitive patterns in the dynamics of solar activity. We have found that the solar activity evolution is dominated by three different types of patterns: (i) a short-term pattern of 70\u201390 years, which corresponds to the solar cycle; (ii) a long-term pattern of 350\u2013400 years, which corresponds to the Gleissberg cycle; and (iii) a very long-term pattern with a duration of several thousand years, which we attribute to the positive feedback between the solar activity and the Earth's climate. The method allows a determination of the relative importance of these patterns for the evolution of solar activity in the past and, consequently, a prediction of the evolution in the future. We have found that the relative weights of the three patterns change with the solar activity level: the short-term pattern is the most important at low activity levels, the long-term pattern is the most important at intermediate activity levels, and the very long-term pattern is the most important at high activity levels. The long-term and the very long-term patterns have a significant cross-correlation, which can be used to predict the evolution of solar activity in the future. We have compared our predictions with the observations for the last 400 years, and the results show a good agreement, with a prediction accuracy level of 80%. Our method allows a prediction of solar activity in the future with a lead time of up to one century."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a class of fast recursive filters for simulating nonlinear dynamic systems. The filters are based on a combination of standard finite difference techniques for solving ordinary differential equations and recent results on the structure of approximate solutions of dynamic systems. The main idea is to replace the linear combination of basis functions used in the conventional finite difference method with a nonlinear combination of basis functions obtained by approximating the solution of the governing differential equations with a small number of basis functions. We show that the proposed filters are equivalent to the conventional method in the sense that they produce the same solutions of the original system. We present a simple example to illustrate the ideas. The example is a nonlinear mass-spring system with a damping term that is proportionate to the velocity of the mass. We show that this system can be approximated with a small number of basis functions and that the proposed filter is significantly faster than the conventional method."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a catalog of cluster member stars selected from a non-simultaneous, non- integrations of high-resolution, near-infrared images obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope's Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2. The catalog contains 42 open clusters, most of which are members of the Milky Way's thin disk. Our selection method, based on color-magnitude diagrams, has proven effective in rejecting field stars and foreground objects. We discuss the clusters' properties, including their temperatures, metallicities, distances, and age, as derived from an analysis of their color-magnitude diagrams and the cluster membership probabilities. We have verified our selection method by comparing the clusters' member stars with those from a previous catalog based on a simultaneous, two-color imaging survey. We find that our selection method agrees with the previous one, with an overlap of 89% of clusters and 94% of stars. We have compared our clusters to those in the literature and find that they are, in general, metal-poor, younger, and lie at larger distances than the clusters in the solar neighborhood. The probability distribution of the clusters' member stars is consistent with a single-zone cluster model with a double-pendulum formation in the outer regions, which is nearly unique to the thin-disk stellar population. Our catalog will be useful in the study of the dynamical and chemical evolution of the thin disk."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present the detection and characterization of 27 new exoplanet candidates from the MACHO survey, including the inner and outer planet systems in the famous 47 UMa and 1 UMa systems. The candidates are selected from images of more than 2000 G and K stars in a half square degree survey, taken with the WASP-3 camera on the 1.5 m telescope at the Waseda University campus. We use a combination of different transit search methods, including a new algorithm that does not require a priori information on the planetary orbital elements, to improve the efficiency of the search. In addition to the detection of the new exoplanet candidates, we also determine upper limits on the incidence of transits for the vast majority of stars in our sample. This upper limit on the occurrence of transits, when combined with the absolute magnitude of the star, can be used to estimate the maximum possible radius of the transiting body in the habitable zone. We discuss the properties of the new exoplanet candidates in the context of known exoplanet systems, and explain how the method we have developed can be extended to determine the properties of tens of thousands of exoplanets in the coming years."}
{"text":"\n\nWe investigate the effects of an external magnetic field and anisotropic interactions on the genuine multipartite entanglement of multi-qubit Heisenberg XY chains. We consider a large number N of qubits arranged in a ring, and assume that the underlying Hamiltonian includes only X and Y interactions. The system is modeled via the methods of spectral theory of graphs. We find that the multipartite entanglement is completely described by the spectral properties of a certain graph that we call the entanglement graph. For a given N, this graph has certain special properties, which we analyze in detail. In particular, we show the existence of a threshold N \u2208 \u2115 such that, if N > 2\u22c5N \u2217 , the entanglement graph becomes connected, and the system is capable of producing pure multipartite entanglement. Below this threshold, the entanglement graph is a disconnected graph, and the system can only produce a mixed state with a small but non-zero entanglement. We also find that anisotropic interactions can affect the structure of the entanglement graph, and can lead to a multipartite entanglement that is not achievable in the absence of anisotropy. Our results provide a useful qualitative description of the effects of anisotropic interactions on the multipartite entanglement of multi-qubit XY chains."}
{"text":"\nWe present a language-based approach for improving the robustness of network application protocol implementations. The approach is motivated by the observation that current network stacks are tightly coupled with the operating system and are not sufficiently adaptable to transient software failures. We show how a language-based approach can provide a clean separation between the application protocol and the network services it uses. This separation enables the application protocol to continue operating despite transient failures in the underlying network stack.\n\nOur approach is to create a domain-specific language for network applications that is sufficiently expressive to describe the application's network services. We define a type system that captures the essential properties of network protocols, and show how to use this type system to detect typing violations that can cause network protocols to be mis-configured. We also define a form of algebraic invariance that captures essential properties of correctly configured network protocols. We show how this algebraic invariance can be used to detect network protocols that are no longer behaving correctly, and how it can be used to selectively disable subsets of a network protocol's functionality in order to improve resilience.\n\nWe have implemented a language-based network stack, and used this implementation to evaluate our approach. Our evaluation shows that our language-based approach is effective at improving the resilience of network application protocols, while maintaining compatibility with existing protocol standards."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a systematic study of star formation around active galactic nuclei (AGN) in nearby galaxies, based on an analysis of the optical images obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope. Our main aim is to investigate the relation between the activity of the central AGN and the star formation rate (SFR) in the surrounding regions. We find that the SFRs in the regions close to AGN (within 50 arcsec) are, on average, higher than in the rest of the galaxy. We show this by using the color-magnitude diagrams of the galaxies, in which the SFR is traced by the absolute magnitude of the main star-forming region. This result is in agreement with previous work based on the analysis of the H\u03b1 images, and it indicates that the AGN activity is somehow promoting star formation in the nearby regions. We also show that the SFR is higher in regions with low metallicity, confirming the results of previous studies based on H\u03b1 images. We discuss several physical mechanisms that may be responsible for the triggering of star formation by the AGN activity, and we suggest that the low metallicity in the regions close to the AGN is due to the photoevaporation of the gas by the AGN's radiation."}
{"text":"\n\nWe generalize the classical theory of ellipses over algebraic extensions. Standard geometric considerations show that any conic section can be written as a sum of a circle and a parabole, in the case of non-degenerate conic sections. In this paper, we show that the construction of a circle from a sum of two conics, one being a circle and the other a parabole, is not in general possible over algebraic extensions. We show that this is due to the lack of an algebraic generalization of the polar angle, which is the angle between a radius vector and the positive x-axis. We show that this generalization is possible for the equatorial circle, i.e., the circle with radius one which is centered at the origin. In the same spirit, we show that the problem of finding a general algebraic extension over which any circle can be constructed from a sum of two conic sections is equivalent to the problem of finding an algebraic extension over which the polar angle can be generalized. We also mention an application of these results to the theory of asymptotes of conic sections."}
{"text":"\nWe present a study of the blue straggler (BS) population in the globular cluster NGC 1904, based on high-resolution spectroscopy and photometry of more than 500 BS candidates in the cluster. Our analysis reveals a tight correlation between the photometric and spectroscopic properties of the BSs, with the stragglers displaying a strong preference for mid- to late-type stars. We show that this preference can be understood in terms of a simple model in which the BSs are formed by the fusion of two stars of different types, with the more massive star being polluted by the lighter one. We determine the mean mass of the BSs, and find that it lies between 1.0 and 1.6 times the mass of the Sun, with a significant fraction ( possibly up to 50%) of the BSs being less massive than the Sun. The distribution of the BSs is highly non-uniform, with a strong preference for the cluster's core region. Our analysis of the BSs' orbital properties reveals a large number of close encounters between stragglers and other cluster members, suggesting that dynamical friction is probably responsible for the removal of the lighter objects from the BS population. We conclude that the observed properties of the BS population are consistent with the hypothesis that the BSs are formed by the fusion of two stars of different types, and that dynamical friction is probably responsible for the removal of the lighter objects from the population."}
{"text":"\n\nAbstract\n\nWe consider the problem of distributing a large file among several hosts in order to maximize the throughput of the distribution process. We assume that the file is split into pieces of equal size, and that the pieces are distributed among the hosts. Each host can send its pieces to any other host, and the throughput of the link between any two hosts is proportional to the number of pieces sent on that link. We study the problem of deciding which pieces to send on which links, in order to maximize the global throughput. We show that this problem is equivalent to deciding which fragments of the file to transmit, where a fragment is a contiguous piece of the file of size at most equal to the link capacity. We present an algorithm to solve this problem, and we show that this algorithm is able to achieve a performance close to the theoretical maximum, even when the number of fragments is very large. We also study the problem of distributing the largest fragment, which is the most difficult to distribute because it can be only partially sent on most links. We show that this problem can be solved in polynomial time, and that the solution is very close to the solution of the original problem."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a new reconstruction of the intrinsic triaxial shape of the Virgo Cluster, based on high-resolution imaging data of its galaxies. We find that the cluster galaxies are well described by a model in which the dark matter is almost perfectly described by a triaxial ellipsoid with a long axis of 8h$^{-1}$Mpc and two short axes of 3.5h$^{-1}$Mpc, inclined at $45^{\\circ}$ to each other. We find that the two short axes are almost perfectly aligned with the two largest principal components of the galaxy distribution, suggesting that the shape is a natural equilibrium configuration. The projected radius of the cluster is 6.5h$^{-1}$Mpc, which is consistent with the radius of a face-on oblate spheroid with the same total mass and triaxial shape. We show that a model in which the mass is equally distributed in all directions, with a concentration parameter $c$ of $1$, is consistent with the observed distribution of galaxies, provided that $c$ is small and the power law index $n$ of the density distribution is close to -1. We discuss a physical mechanism that may naturally produce such a distribution of matter, and find that the physical scale of the process is of the order of the cluster scale."}
{"text":"\nDynamic fracture of icosahedral model quasicrystals: A molecular dynamics study.\n\nWe investigate the dynamic fracture of icosahedral quasicrystals using a molecular dynamics technique that is specifically designed to address the anisotropic nature of quasicrystals. Our approach is based on the calculation of the configurational energy using a table of interatomic distances that is derived from the optimized icosahedral potential. The energy is evaluated in an efficient manner using a multipole expansion, and the crack propagation is governed by the energy barrier, which is evaluated in each time step. We find that the dynamic fracture of quasicrystals is strongly influenced by the anisotropic nature of the potential, which results in a higher energy barrier for the <111> direction than for the <100> direction. We also show that the anisotropic energy barriers result in a preferred crack propagation direction, which is aligned with the <111> direction in the case of the icosahedral quasicrystals. Our results are consistent with the recent experimental observations of preferred crack propagation in quasicrystals."}
{"text":"\nWe describe a new very massive modular liquid argon imaging chamber which will be used to search for low energy off-axis neutrinos from the CNGS beam. The main motivation for the research is to improve the sensitivity to low energy neutrinos from the CNGS beam over the current state-of-the-art detectors which will lead to a precise measurement of the neutrino-nucleon cross section at low energy. The key idea is to use a large volume of liquid argon as the detection medium, to use 3D array of flash lamps as the illumination system and to use a 3D array of photo-detectors to register the tracks of nuclear particles. We describe the main design features of the detector and the results of a series of measurements which were carried out to test the design and to achieve better understanding of the physical processes which occur in the detector. The main result of the project is the design of the detector which is optimized for the proposed measurement and which will be used for the future neutrino experiments. We also discuss several other scientific projects which will be carried out with the detector and which are important for the physics program of the LDE neutrino group."}
{"text":"\nWe develop a unified projection formalism for the Al-Pd-Mn quasicrystal, which includes theHealthcare industry relevant literature review, theoretical background and methodology, results and discussion. We consider the system from the thermodynamic and kinetic point of view, in particular the growth and the static structures. The quasicrystal is projected in the first Brillouin zone, in the special case of the octahedral point group. The thermal behavior is discussed within the Ising model formalism. We determine the simple non- aestivum regeneration mechanisms and the corresponding driving forces. The effects of the Ising-like spins on the electronic structure are investigated by the use of the projected BCS wave functions. The correlation functions of the mobile spins are obtained by the use of the moment-function technique. We find that the existence of the Ising-like spins in the octahedral hole is a necessary condition for the quasiperiodic order. Our results are consistent with the existence of an extended defect called the Al-Pd-Mn skyrmion."}
{"text":"\nWe present a detailed study of the blue compact galaxies (BCGs), a population of dwarf spheroidal galaxies characterized by a dominant blue color, a high surface brightness, and a low star formation rate. We use high-resolution spectroscopy and imaging to study the stellar content and the dynamics of a sample of 34 galaxies in this population. We find that the BCGs contain a significant blue straggler population, with an estimated dynamical age of about 7 Gyr, but no evidence for young stellar populations. The majority of the BCGs (82%) contain an old stellar population (age > 12 Gyr), similar to the globular clusters, but a large fraction of these (52%) also contain a blue straggler population. This suggests that these BCGs have gone through a recent period of dynamical friction, possibly due to a gravitational encounter with another galaxy. We also find that the blue straggler population has a much lower metallicity than the old stellar population, with an estimated metallicity of [Fe\/H] \u2248 +0.2, consistent with the hypothesis that these objects are the result of a dynamical mixing of metal-poor and metal-rich populations. The relatively high metallicities of the BCGs (on average [Fe\/H] \u2248 +0.6), compared to the globular clusters (on average [Fe\/H] \u2248 +2.3), suggest that these galaxies have accreted metal-rich populations. Our results suggest that the blue compact galaxies are the result of a recent (dynamically speaking) accretion event of a metal-rich stellar population on a metal-poor stellar population, possibly in a globular cluster."}
{"text":"\nWe study the magnetic properties of the natural magnetic mineral volborthite using a combination of bulk and single-crystal magnetic susceptibility, heat capacity, and magnetic field-induced optical measurements. The data show that volborthite is a Heisenberg antiferromagnet with anisotropic exchange on the Kagome lattice. We found that the three magnetic components in volborthite, which are related to the three different types of cations, have very different magnetic properties, with the magnetism of the octahedral coordinated Fe2+ cations being the most prominent. In addition, we observed a significant positive thermodynamic contribution to the magnetic entropy, which may be related to the nearly degenerate magnetic state with a very high magnetic order parameter, close to that of the corresponding completely ordered magnet. We also found evidence for a large number of magnetic domain walls in volborthite, possibly related to the anisotropic exchange, and a significant increase in the magnetic entropy upon applying a magnetic field along the easy direction, which is consistent with the presence of a large number of magnetic domain walls. Our results reveal that volborthite is a unique magnetic mineral with interesting and complex magnetic properties."}
{"text":"\n\nWe investigate a system composed of a one-dimensional quantum dot embedded in a reservoir and weakly coupled to it, which is in a state with many particle-hole excitations. We show that the system can be well described by a Deformed Wigner crystal, a generalization of a Wigner crystal to a system with an infinite number of degrees of freedom. The stability of the Deformed Wigner crystal is ensured by a strict conservation of the symmetry of the elementary excitations. We show that such a conservation is guaranteed by the interatomic Hamiltonian in a certain range of values of the parameters of the system. Within this range, the Deformed Wigner crystal is stable against a deformation, i.e. a change of the elementary excitations. We analyze the mechanism of the formation of the Deformed Wigner crystal and find that it is based on the competition between an extended Kondo and singlet phases. The transition to the Deformed Wigner crystal is associated with a sharp drop in the thermal conductance, and therefore, it can be detected by a thermal Aharonov-Bohm signature. Our results suggest that in a large class of systems the elementary excitations are necessarily symmetric, which has important consequences for the physics of finite systems."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present an analysis of the potential of the Gravity Probe B (GPB) experiment to constrain torsion theories of gravity. We show that if the torsion component of the gravitational field is significantly larger than the quantum gravity (QG) predictions, GPB will be able to detect it. We analyze the possible phenomenology, considering the most relevant theories, such as General Relativity (GR) with a cosmological constant, a flavor of QG in which the spacetime is a two-dimensional (2D) Lorentzian manifold, and another flavor of QG in which the spacetime is a 3D Lorentzian manifold. We derive a simple formula which describes the constraints that GPB can place on the torsion component of the gravity field, and use it to evaluate the constraints for the three theories mentioned. We show that the GPB constraints on the 2D theory are much stronger than the ones on the 3D theory, while both are weakly constrained by GR with a cosmological constant. Finally, we comment on the phenomenology which may arise in the future from a more precise measurement of the Newtonian gravitational constant, G, and the radius of the Earth's orbit, RE, from the same laboratory, as proposed by the Marble Web Experiment."}
{"text":"\n\nWe have developed a model of the evolution of the Universe and the origin of galaxies. Our model is based on the idea that the evolution of the Universe is a process of successive generations of structures, in each of which the structures of the previous generation are shattered and the pieces are reassembled into more complex structures. The first generation of structures consists of small fluctuations in the density of the Universe that grow in size and become the seeds for the formation of galaxies. The second generation of structures are the galaxies that form from the seeds, and the third generation are the clusters of galaxies that form from the galaxies. We have shown that the evolution of the Universe is a process of exponential growth, and that the growth rate is related to the average density of the Universe. We have also shown that the structure of the Universe is self-organized, and that the process of evolution is driven by the energy released by the formation of structures. We have estimated the growth rate of the Universe and the average density of the Universe, and we have shown that they are consistent with the observed evolution of the Universe. We have also shown that the growth rate of the Universe is related to the average density of the Universe, and that the growth rate is higher when the average density is higher. We have shown that the evolution of the Universe is a process of successive generations of structures, and that the structures of each generation are more complex than the structures of the previous generation. We have also shown that the process of evolution is driven by the energy released by the formation of structures, and that the energy is used to form the next generation of structures."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present UBVRI photometry of stellar structures in the disk of the barred galaxy NGC 3367, in an effort to determine the relative amounts of young stars, old stars, and dust in these structures. We find that the color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of these structures follow well-defined relationships in color and magnitude, which we are able to use to identify young stars, old stars, and dust. We find that the brightest stars in these structures are generally young, while the dust is generally found in the red sequence. We determine the extinction toward the disk of NGC 3367 to be E(B - V) = 0.72 +- 0.05. We find that the young stars follow a color-magnitude relation similar to the main sequence in the solar neighborhood, while the old stars follow a relation that is redder and brighter than the solar main sequence. We present a qualitative model in which a ring of old stars is embedded within a ring of young stars, with dust (and gas) in between the two rings. The model is in qualitative agreement with our observations, suggesting that such a structure may be a natural consequence of bar formation and evolution."}
{"text":"\n\nWe investigate the role of chaos and symmetry in string cosmology. We show that a slight break down of thesymmetry of the stringy dynamics can have a major impact on the evolution of the universe. In particular we consider the case of a spontaneously broken Symplectic group, which corresponds to a non-trivial Cosmological constant, and show that in this case the evolution is generically chaotic. We find that the level of chaos can be related to the string scale, and thus is very large in the early universe. We also find that the structure of the string dynamics has a strong influence on the shape of the probability distribution function, and thus on the structure of the matter power spectrum. In particular we find that a random choice of the stringy dynamics typically produces a scale invariant power spectrum, while a more structured dynamics produces a power law one. We also discuss the role of chaos and symmetry in the stringy description of the early universe, and the relation between the string dynamics and the effective dynamics of the early universe."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present observations of the globular cluster G1 in the galaxy ESOvarious radio emission from the globular cluster G1 in the galaxy ESO2736-67. The radio emission is relatively compact, with an extension of about 1.4 kpc along the direction of the globular cluster's velocity. The radio power law has a dispersion of 1.5 Hz\u2022kpc-1 and a cut-off frequency of 1.5 GHz, with a peak flux of 1.5 mJy. The low frequency radio emission has a well-defined boundary, which is not aligned with the optical boundary of the cluster. The observed radio structure has a double-peak morphology. The inner peak is displaced by about 3.4 kpc from the cluster centre, and the outer peak is located at the cluster's periphery. The observed double-peak structure could be a signature of a central engine, such as an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH), with a rotational period longer than the cluster's orbital period. We estimate the mass of the IMBH to be 2.2x10^8 M\u2299, with a 4-5 kpc size, and a concentration of about 10-13. This makes the G1 cluster a candidate host for an IMBH. Our results suggest that the radio emission from G1 may be due to an accretion disc around an IMBH. The low-frequency radio emission could be due to the low-frequencyhis would be a strong indication that G1 is a globular cluster with a massive central object, most likely an IMBH."}
{"text":"\nWe construct a class of Landau-Lifshitz sigma-models which in a suitable limit are equivalent to a type of fermionic soup, a model which has recently attracted much attention in connection with the AdS\/CFT correspondence. We show that this class of models has a natural generalization which is not merely a quantization of some bulk model but rather a composite model with a discrete mass spectrum and a Landau-Lifshitz dynamics. This model can be thought of as an effective description of a large number of fermionic quasiparticles with a range of masses distributed around some target mass value. We show that this effective description can be extracted from a large class of bulk sigma-models with a non-renormalizable Lorentzian dynamics, by means of a limit procedure which is analogous to the one which extracts the AdS\/CFT sigma-model from the bulk theory. We discuss some of the aspects of the structure and dynamics of these models which are most evident from the formalism we develop, and we suggest a number of ways in which the results can be interpreted physically."}

We find that the order parameter has a continuous dependence on the field, in spite of the fact that the hard-rods can only form defects, not perfect crystals. The critical field depends on the thermal energy and the interaction strength between the hard-rods, but it does not depend on the initial configuration. For a range of temperatures, the order parameter increases continuously with the field, until it reaches a maximum, and then decreases again. We also find a transition to a different type of ordered structure, in which the hard-rods form a layered structure, with a clear first-order transition line. For this new structure, the order parameter has a non-monotonic dependence on the field. We also study the influence of a local field, which can be thought of as a defects or impurities in the fluid. We find that such a field can have a significant effect on the order parameter, even if it is small, and can lead to a complete breakdown of the order. Our results suggest a general mechanism for the destruction of order in fluids, which is based on the competition between different types of defects."}
{"text":"\nWe study the large-scale structure of spacetimes in Horava-Witten theory on a compact complex hyperbolic threefold. We find a large amount of structure, including a class of globally symmetric spacetimes which can be understood as the 'maximally symmetric' kind of black hole solution in this theory, in the sense that they are as symmetric as possible taking into account the fact that the fundamental group of the underlying space is not compact. We show that this class of solutions includes the AdS black hole as the unique (up to an overall constant) solution with a given mass, charge and angular momentum, and which is defined on the whole space. We give a general method to construct other kinds of black hole solutions with less symmetry, and show that the minimal symmetry has a simple group theoretical interpretation. Finally, we give a physical interpretation to the large-scale structure of the theory in terms of the relative importance of gravity and the geometry of the underlying space."}

{"text":"\n\nThe magnetic structure of the rare-earth intermetallic compound Sm2IrIn8 was investigated by means of magnetic susceptibility, magnetometry, and neutron diffraction measurements. We found a long-range magnetic order with a = 8.45 \u00c5 and c = 5.71 \u00c5, which is consistent with the observed magnetic correlations in the ordered phase. To reveal the detailed magnetic structure, we performed a three-dimensional (3D) magnetic vector analysis. The analysis showed a 3D network of magnetic vectors, which were found to originate from a 2D network of magnetic clusters in the basal plane. The magnetic clusters are composed of a few magnetic ions, which are evenly distributed in the cluster. The intercluster magnetic vectors form a 3D network and link the clusters to each other. The long-range magnetic order is related to the antiferromagnetic correlations between the clusters. The 3D magnetic vector analysis also revealed the presence of a non-zero spin-orbit interaction (SOI) along the c axis, which is related to the Dzyaloshinksy-Moriya interaction."}

{"text":"\n\n Exploring Infrared Properties of Giant Low Surface Brightness Galaxies\n\nWe present a study of the infrared properties of a sample of nine giant low surface brightness galaxies (LSBGs) selected from the 2 Micron All Sky Survey. We find that the infrared color of these galaxies is well described by a power law with a spectral index of 1.6 \u00b1 0.1. The best fit to the data is a modified blackbody with a temperature of 9.6 \u00b1 0.7 kelvin. This temperature is consistent with the galaxies being heated by the accretion shock from a supermassive black hole at their nuclei. We conclude that the low surface brightness galaxies are likely to be a population of passive galaxies in which the accretion shock is the dominant source of energy. We present a model in which the observed correlation between surface brightness and stellar mass is explained by the galaxies evolving along different tracks in a universal density diagram. We find that the low surface brightness galaxies have a higher gas fraction than the high surface brightness galaxies, supporting the idea that the low surface brightness galaxies are gas-rich. We also find that the low surface brightness galaxies are likely to have accretion shocks at both their nuclei and their satellites. We discuss several implications of our findings, including the fact that the low surface brightness galaxies are likely to contain a large population of low mass galaxies and that they are likely to contain a large amount of gas that could be available for accretion by supermassive black holes."}
{"text":"\n\nWe develop a staggered heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory (SCPT) within the framework of the effective two-meson theory. The staggered CPT (SCT) is applicable to the case of strong external fields. In this theory the chiral symmetry is not protected by a condensation mechanism as is the case for the conventional CPT. The basic idea of the SCT is to take into account the two different contributions to the evolution of the quark fields, corresponding to the quark and antiquark charged currents, in a staggered way. The SCT contains two additional parameters, which can be fixed from the beginning or be allowed to vary, and the evolution of the quark fields is given in terms of the two integral equations for the quark and antiquark charged currents. The SCT has a good physical basis, is consistent with the CPT, and in a certain range of the parameters it gives an improvement of the description of the strong interaction compared to the CPT. We also compare the SCT with the standard CPT in the limit of small meson masses and small external field strengths, and show that the SCT gives a slightly better description of the strong interaction in this limit."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present an analysis of the evolution of the magnetic field geometry in F and G stars, based on high-resolution observations of the magnetic field distribution on their photospheres. Our analysis reveals that the magnetic field in these stars is evolving in a way that is consistent with the disappearance of the magnetic dipole component and the growth of the toroidal component, which then continues to increase in strength and uniformity as the star ascending the Upper Main Sequence. We show that the toroidal field can become strong and uniform, and can even match the strength of the poloidal field, as it is in the solar twin star. The distribution of the magnetic field geometry in these stars is consistent with a model in which the toroidal field is generated by a competition between the toroidal and poloidal field components. We show that the ratio of the toroidal to poloidal field strengths is proportional to the poloidal field strength, with the proportionality constant equal to the ratio of the toroidal to poloidal field amplitudes. We explain this proportionality by a model in which the poloidal field is \"squeezed\" out of the surface layers by the toroidal field. We show that the model predictions for the distribution of the magnetic field geometry are consistent with observations in a wide range of F and G stars."}

We have now imaged this dust disk with unprecedented resolution, and have discovered that it is much more complicated than astronomers had previously realised. In particular, we find that the disk has at least one ring-like feature, in addition to the central disk. We also find that the dust is not distributed evenly in the disk, but is instead clumped together in several places. Our results are consistent with the disk having been perturbed by the passage of a planet or planets, and provide a dramatic demonstration of the power of Hubble to study the disks of dust and gas surrounding stars."}

The thermal expansion coefficient was determined with a relative uncertainty as low as 1.5 ppb\/K using a silicon carbide mastersky. We show that SiC-100 has a higher thermal expansion coefficient than ZERODUR but a much higher thermal conductivity. The high thermal conductivity causes a strong temperature dependence of the measured thermal expansion coefficient. We derived a temperature dependent correction curve for the thermal expansion coefficient which can be used to reduce the measurement uncertainty to 0.5 ppb\/K.

{"text":"\n\nWe present observations of Fe K alpha lines in a sample of 22 magnetic cataclysmic variables (MCVs) observed with the optical\/NIR telescope TANTAN.

We find that a model in which the magnetic field is aligned with the orbital angular momentum but with a large amplitude, i.e. a Larmor precession model, consistently describes the observations. We show that this model predicts a blue wing in the scattered Fe K alpha lines, which is in agreement with observations in a few cases. In addition, the model predicts that the strength of the blue wing depends on the viewing angle, which is in agreement with the observations. We discuss several methods to estimate the strength of the magnetic field from the observations of scattered Fe K alpha lines. We show that the precession model predicts a dependence of the strength of the magnetic field on the viewing angle which is in good agreement with the observations.

{"text":"\n\nWe present a study of the distribution of crystalline silicates and dust processing in the protoplanetary disks of the Taurus young cluster. The data set used for this study comprises 54 asteroids and meteorites, including the well-studied Vesta andpinkering, and 22 protoplanetary disks observed with the Hubble Space Telescope. We find that the mass-abundance distribution of crystalline silicates in the disks is best described by a power law with a linear correlation to the gas-abundance scaling. The maximum abundance of silicates is 5\u201310% of the gas-phase molecular hydrogen, which is consistent with the global dust-to-gas ratio measured in the disks. We also find that the mean size of dust grains is a strong function of the distance to the star, suggesting that the processing of dust grains is influenced by the gas-drag forces and the relative velocity of the grains to the gas. In particular, we find that the size of the largest dust grains is inversely proportional to the distance to the star. This trend is consistent with the expected inverse relation between the relative velocity of the grains and the distance to the star, and suggests that the large grains are processed at the inner parts of the disk, and that they are then transported to the outer parts of the disk by radial diffusion. We discuss the implications of our results for the formation and evolution of the disks, and for the eventual chemical composition of the protoplanets."}
{"text":"\nWe present the first comprehensive study of superhumps in normal and spotted gaited horses. We find that superhumps can be simulated by a reduced-order model in which the stride-to-cadence ratio is allowed to vary non-monotonically. This finding has important practical implications for the design of instruments for measuring horse gaits and for the analysis of inappropriate gaits, such as superhumps, which are associated with mechanical or neurological problems. We find that superhumps can be triggered by either a constant or a varying vertical excitation, provided that the variation frequency is at least 3 times the natural frequency of the vertical oscillation of the body. However, a linear stability analysis shows that the threshold for the appearance of superhumps is affected by the form of the non-monotonic stride-to-cadence relation, with a relatively higher threshold for a polynomial relation than for a linear relation. We also found that a forward-backward motion with a constant frequency can trigger superhumps in gaited horses, provided that the amplitude of the forward-backward motion is large enough."}

This model is used to investigate the effects of non-gravitational forces on the large scale structure of the Universe. We find that the density field is well described by a Gaussian kernel with a scale of the order of the transition scale a \u2248 0.4, in agreement with the scale expected from the theory of gravitational instability. The power law index of the density field is found to be in good agreement with the index expected from gravitational instability, and in disagreement with the index expected from the shock wave theory. The contribution of non-gravitational forces to the large scale structure is found to be small and its signature is mostly washed out by the gravitational forces. We conclude that non-gravitational forces do not significantly affect the large scale structure of the Universe."}

Our observations include high-precision photometry from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, and medium-precision photometry from the Fine Guidance Sensor onboard the Hubble Space Telescope. Together these data are used to derive the orbital elements and physical characteristics of the Centaur. We find that Ceto and Phorcys have a relatively circular orbit with many, narrow, eccentric, and closely-spaced orbits superimposed on this baseline. The semimajor axis of the orbit is 133.8 +0.9\/-0.9 km, with the period given by the spheroidal orbit being 70.685 +0.016\/-0.016 years. The orbital elements are in reasonable agreement with those derived from astrometric observations, with a small but non-zero inclination to the plane of the sky. The true orbit is probably closer to circular than the spheroidal orbit, indicating that this system is very slowly evolving. We estimate the masses of Ceto and Phorcys to be 3.00 +0.09\/-0.09 and 2.98 +0.09\/-0.09 kg, respectively.

Our result is in contrast with the case of small-world and random networks, where the weight function method typically predicts convergence to a local optimum. In the case of scale-free networks, we show that a small percentage of the nodes (the hubs) have a large number of connections, while the other nodes have only a few connections. In this way, we show that the local optimum is distant in the space of the tie-strengths for most of the nodes, and that the opinion dynamic will therefore converge to a consensus in a finite number of steps.

{"text":"\n\nWe present observations of the silicate features in a sample of luminous QSOs, made with the ISIS spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope. We find that the silicate features are extremely broad in the high-luminosity QSOs, and this broad structure is due to the scattering of the silicate feature in a large number of small grains. We estimate the grain covering factor (FCF) and find that it varies from one to two orders of magnitude depending on the luminosity of the QSO. We also find a correlation between the silicate luminosity and the FCF, which can be described by a power law. This indicates that the increase of the silicate luminosity with QSO luminosity is due to the increase of the grain number density and not to the increase of the individual grain size. We discuss this in the framework of the silicate model and we conclude that the increase of the FCF with QSO luminosity is compatible with a constant grain size distribution, provided that the grains are sufficiently small. We also conclude that the grain size distribution must be very broad (with a FWHM larger than 1 mag) to account for the observed broad silicate features. We discuss the practical consequences of our findings in the framework of the silicate model and we suggest that the silicate feature is probably the best tracer of the dust content in galaxies.

We find that the main difference between the model and the observations is that the model predicts more galaxies at large redshifts and fewer at small redshifts than are observed. We discuss possible physical reasons for this difference, and we show that relaxing the assumption of perfect galaxy formation in the model can produce a distribution of galaxies more in agreement with observations.

{"text":"\n\nWe propose the use of triangular elements in the solution of the boundary element method (BEM) for elastodynamics in anisotropic and inhomogeneous media. The motivation for this work is the frequent occurrence of anisotropy and inhomogeneity in the realistic geological media, and the interest in the efficient solution of the full-waveform BEM in such media. The use of triangular elements allows the full-waveform BEM to be cast as a matrix-vector product, significantly reducing the computation time. The main idea is to consider the continuity of the trace of the displacement as the basis for the triangular elements. The main advantage of this approach is that the triangular elements can be constructed independently of the properties of the medium, and hence can be used in any anisotropic and inhomogeneous media. The use of triangular elements also allows an exact formulation of the BEM in any dimension, N, with any space-use matrix, S, and any integration rule, G. We show that the use of such triangular elements results in the expression of the BEM solution in a compact and exact form, involving only the N-dimensional pseudospectral representation of the solution, the N\u00d7N trace matrix of the space-use matrix, and the N\u00d7N inverse of the integration rule. The use of triangular elements also allows the BEM to be solved in a nearly exact fashion, without the introduction of any additional small parameters. We demonstrate the use of triangular elements by considering the solution of the two-dimensional BEM for elastodynamics in anisotropic and inhomogeneous media, with the space-use matrix and the integration rule expressed in the context of the 2\u00d72 triangular elements. The results of numerical examples show that the proposed method is stable and accurate, and is significantly more efficient than the conventional method based on the use of rectangular elements."}
{"text":"\n\nWe investigate the effect of the solar corona on the attenuation of small-amplitude prominence oscillations. We use a two-dimensional magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) model that includes a small-scale dynamo and the effect of the solar wind (SW) to study the evolution of a small-amplitude ( resonant) prominence oscillation. We find that, for a given solar wind velocity, there is a critical value of the longitudinal magnetic field ( MagL ) above which the resonance is excited. We show that this critical value of MagL depends inversely on the vertical magnetic field ( MagZ ), suggesting that small-amplitude prominence oscillations are more easily excited in regions of large vertical magnetic field. We further investigate the effect of the solar corona on the evolution of the resonant prominence oscillation. To this end, we develop a simple model in which the density of the corona is treated as a linear function of the longitudinal magnetic field. We show that including the effect of the corona results in a good agreement between the model predictions and the observations, suggesting that the effect of the corona is important for the understanding of the dynamics of small-amplitude prominence oscillations."}

We also study the problem of finding a one-way permutation that depends on a small amount of secret data and on a publicly computable function that is itself not one-way. This problem is motivated by the study of distortion functions, which are functions that map strings to strings in such a way that two different strings that are close to each other in the initial domain are also close to each other in the image domain.

We show that this method is more precise than the classic method that uses the semi-major axis as a measure of the orbital elements. We also derive a relation between the surface gravity and the age of the planet. We applied the method to the well-studied extrasolar planets HD 209458 b and HD 205739 b. We found that the surface gravity of HD 209458 b is about 2.6 dex and that this value is consistent with a mass-radius relation for planets with a metallicity of Z=0.5. We also found that the surface gravity of HD 205739 b is about 1.2 dex. We discuss these results in the framework of recent observations of the atmospheres of transiting extrasolar planets."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a catalog of 1,722 star cluster candidates in M33, based on an analysis of two sets of images obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope. The first set of images was obtained with the Wide Field and Planetary Camera (WFPC) in 1998, and the second with the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) in 2004. The catalog contains 898 new cluster candidates, which more than doubles the number of known star clusters in M33. We describe a statistical method for identifying star clusters in color-magnitude diagrams. The method makes use of the fact that clusters are composed of stars that are approximately the same age, and therefore have similar colors and magnitudes. We apply this method to the two sets of HST images, and combine the results to produce our catalog of star cluster candidates. The new catalog shows a preference for clusters with intermediate ages, between 3 and 10 billion years. We also present a new algorithm for estimating the star formation rate in M33, based on the star cluster candidates and an updated estimate of the stellar mass of the galaxy. The estimated star formation rate is 11 \u00b1 3 per cent per year, with a total current mass of 1.5 \u00b1 0.5 x 1011  M\u2299. This represents a major increase over previous estimates, and suggests that M33 is still a site of active star formation."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a catalog of 1,692 optically-selected galaxy clusters selected from the SDSS DR4 Galaxy Clusters sample. We use this catalog to study the global properties of these clusters. We find that the clusters have a linear size of 2.5 Mpc, a surface brightness of 21.0 mag\/arcmin2, and an overdensity of 2.5 relative to the mean density of the surrounding medium. We find that the clusters are well described by a power law distribution in both size and brightness. We use the catalog to search for voids within the Survey area. We find that the voids have a minimum size of 8 Mpc and a minimum overdensity of -0.7 relative to the mean density of the Survey area. We find that the clusters and voids are well described by a \"cluster mountain pass\" distribution. We also present a catalog of $^*$-ray sources found within the clusters. We find that the $^*$-ray surface brightness of the clusters is 1.5 mag\/arcmin2, which is not different from the mean $^*$-ray surface brightness of the Survey area. We find that the $^*$-ray counts in the clusters are described by a power law distribution with a break at $^*$-ray energies of $1.2 \\, \\mathrm{keV}$."}
{"text":"\n\nWe propose and experimentally realize a novel method to produce Gaussian valence bond states, which are a generalization of the concept of Gaussian bosons to the case of massive particles. Our method is based on the idea of dressing a certain class of multipartite entangled states, called Paragraph 2 states, in a laser field. We show that such dressed states are well-approximated by Gaussian functions, and thus are suitable to be used as qubits in quantum information processing. In particular, we investigate a simple scheme for quantum teleportation and gate operations, and show that it is possible to perform these operations by using only Gaussian valence bond states, without the need for any other intermediate qubit registers. We also propose a method to distribute entanglement between different such qubit registers, which is particularly useful in the context of large-scale quantum computers. Our experimental realization of the proposed schemes is based on the use of ultra-cold atomic gases, and we report on the successful implementation of the schemes using our experimental apparatus."}
{"text":"\nWe consider the problem of estimating the unconditional distribution of post-model-selection estimators (PMEs), that is, estimators that are obtained by first selecting a model and then computing corresponding estimators. We show that if the selected model is misspecified then the conditional distribution of the PMEs is not necessarily close to the unconditional distribution of the corresponding estimators that would be obtained if the model was correctly specified. As a result, the usual theory that guarantees the convergence of the conditional distribution of PMEs to the unconditional distribution of estimators does not apply in general. We investigate the conditions that guarantee that the conditional distribution of PMEs is close to the unconditional distribution of estimators. Our conditions involve the strongest assumption that the method of moments is applicable to the underlying model. We also propose a simple modification of the usual theory that is applicable in more general settings and that produces a convergence result for the conditional distribution of PMEs. As an application, we consider the problem of estimating the unconditional distribution of model parameters."}
{"text":"\n\nWe have carried out a statistical study of the X-ray emission in a sample of Type 1 active galactic nuclei (AGN) in which the accretion-disc luminosity has been estimated from optical and N-ray observations. We have used the mean X-ray count-rate as a function of the accretion-disc luminosity to infer the dominate power law behaviour of the X-ray emission. The inferred power law indices are found to be distributed in a wide range, and in addition, the shape of the X-ray count-rate - accretion-disc luminosity relation is very poorly described by a single power law. These results suggest that the power law index of the X-ray emission is not uniquely related to the accretion-disc luminosity, but rather, the relation is likely to be complex and dependent on the detailed structure of the accretion disc and the innermost region of the jet. We have found a significant correlation between the X-ray power law index and the accretion-disc structure as revealed by high-resolution imaging of the accretion disc. Our results suggest that the jet power law index is a useful diagnostic for the dominant contribution to the accretion-flow luminosity: either the disc or the jet."}
{"text":"\nFlavour-Dependent Type II Leptogenesis\n\nWe study the flavour-dependent formation of heavy nuclei far from stability, so-called type II leptogenesis, in the framework of the interacting- pebble bed model. We find that the favourable branching ratio of the ${}^{10}$ ${}^{56}$ ${}^{90}$ ${}^{144}$ channels is small and decreases with increasing mass number. In contrast, the ${}^{56}$ ${}^{90}$ ${}^{144}$ ${}^{198}$ ${}^{252}$ channels have a strongly flavour-dependent branching ratio and the ${}^{90}$ ${}^{144}$ ${}^{198}$ ${}^{252}$ channels even have a branching ratio that increases with the mass number. We show that this striking difference is due to the strong $(n-1)$- and $(n-2)$-level interactions in the ${}^{56}$ and ${}^{90}$ nuclei that strongly suppress the formation of the ${}^{10}$ and ${}^{144}$ nuclei and to the large $(n-1)$- and $(n-2)$-level interactions in the ${}^{144}$ and ${}^{198}$ nuclei that strongly enhance the formation of the ${}^{56}$ and ${}^{90}$ nuclei.

{"text":"\n\nWe present the results of a study of the assembly history of the stellar mass in galaxies, based on a detailed analysis of the VIMOS VLT Deep Survey redshift survey. We show that the stellar mass of galaxies has increased monotonically from very small values in the young Universe to the present day, with a break at around z=1-2, due to the transition from the formation of the first galaxies to the rapid build-up of the Galactic star-formation. We also show that the assembly history is well described by a simple model in which the stellar mass of a galaxy is proportional to the integral of the star-formation rate density over the last 12 billion years. Based on this model we predict that the current stellar mass function should be well described by a power law with a slope of -1.5. This prediction is in agreement with recent observations of the local galaxy population, and suggests that the mass function has been very well described by a single power law throughout the whole history of galaxy formation. Our analysis reveals a clear signature of a major epoch of galaxy formation at z \\sim 1-2, which is in agreement with the rapid build-up of the Galactic star-formation, and suggests that this event may have been common to many galaxies in the local group. Our results also suggest that the processes of galaxy formation were slow and steady, and that there were no other major epochs of galaxy formation in the last 12 billion years. We discuss our results in the context of the theory of galaxy formation, and in particular in the context of the cold dark matter model, in which the main epoch of galaxy formation is assumed to have occurred very early in the history of the Universe."}
{"text":"\nWe have developed a new method to measure the energy-dependent linear polarization of soft gamma-rays using the Compton scattering in a large, thick, rigid, parallel-plate avalanche counter (PPAC) made of lead-glass (PoGOLite). The motivation for this work is to improve the statistics of polarization measurement in the energy region around the polarization peak of the Compton scattered photon in PoGOLite, to study the depolarization effects in this energy region. The key idea is to use a large-area, thick, rigid, PoGOLite detector, which is robust against the thermal effect, and to increase the number of detector elements to improve the statistics. The improvement in the statistics is important to be able to study the polarization properties of the Compton scattered photon in a PoGOLite detector. The methodology we used is to prepare a large-area, thick, rigid, PoGOLite detector, and to use a multi-channel Anger camera to obtain the spatially-resolved, energy- and polarization-dependent detection probabilities. We obtained the energy- and polarization-dependent detection probabilities for a thick, rigid, PoGOLite detector with 462 detector elements. From the measured detection probabilities, we obtained the energy- and polarization-dependent mean-square-error and the energy- and polarization-dependent depolarization factors. We obtained the results for the energy region around the polarization peak of the Compton scattered photon in PoGOLite. From the results, we studied the energy- and polarization-dependent depolarization effects."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present observations of the broadband spectral evolution of the Crab Nebula (Cebalragureeb) during the prompt and afterglow phases of the bright burst GRB 061121. Our observations constrain the energy deposition in the inner nebula to be  \u223c 4 kJ assuming a typical expansion velocity of 1,000 km s-1. We find that the ionization and evacuation of the gas by the burst is similar to that expected from a small, local supernova explosion, suggesting that the dominant ionizing radiation in the inner nebula is not the burst but rather the recently discovered soft gamma-ray source SGR 1900+14. We estimate the energy of this source to be  \u223c 5 kJ, which is not only comparable to but possibly larger than the energy deposited by the burst. This indicates that SGR 1900+14 is either a very close supernova (within  \u223c 5 kpc) or an intense radio source with a very high energy density ( \u223c 1014\u20131015 W m-3), perhaps powered by a combination of a black hole, massive stars, and active galactic nucleus. Our results imply that further study of the ionization and evacuation of gas in young and old nebulae by energetic bursts and a better understanding of the relative contributions of burst and non-burst ionizing sources are important to the study of galactic and intergalactic medium."}
{"text":"\n\nWe investigate the statistical properties of the stationary solutions of the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations with a random forcing, in the limit of a large Reynolds number. We show that the solutions exhibit two types of statistical turbulence: one is associated with large-scale motion, similar to that expected in the inertial range of a fully developed flow, and the other is associated with small-scale motion, similar to that expected in the boundary layer. Our results suggest that the inertial range turbulence can be described by the same statistical laws as the small scales, with the only difference being the strength of the correlation, which is large in the inertial range and small in the boundary layer. This similarity is shown to hold for both the mean velocity and the higher-order moments of the velocity. We also show that the probability distribution of the instantaneous velocity has the same form in both ranges, with the only difference being the scale of the velocity, which is large in the inertial range and small in the boundary layer."}
{"text":"\nWe present analytical expressions for the contributions to the degradation in the spatial resolution of images formed by grazing-incidence X-ray telescopes from the scattering of X-rays in the telescope optics. We evaluate these contributions for a range of telescope designs and operating conditions, and compare with previous approximate and numerical results. The accuracy of the presented expressions is confirmed by comparison with detailed numerical solutions for several example cases. We show that for a typical grazing-incidence telescope the effect of X-ray scattering in the optics is more important than the effect of X-ray absorption by the optics, contrary to the widely-held belief that the degradation is mainly due to absorption. We also derive analytical expressions for the spatial distribution of the X-ray flux incident on the imaging array, in the case of a grazing-incidence telescope using a wedge-and-strip X-ray mirror. We show that this can be used to optimize the design of the imaging array, in terms of the aspect ratio and pixel pitch, for a given telescope design and operating conditions."}

{"text":"\n\nWe present a high-resolution study of a star-forming region in the Cepheus A H II region, which contains a rich open cluster of stars (ACF 25) and a number of nearby molecular clouds. We have imaged with milliarcsecond resolution, by means of Very Long Baseline Interferometry, the radio source W3(R1), which is the cluster's most massive member. The objectives of our study are to investigate the distribution of ionized gas in the region, to determine the mass of the cluster, and to search for infalling gas. We find that the ionized gas in the cluster is fairly homogeneously distributed, with a projected surface density of log(\u03a3\u22c5 pc2) \u2248 7.5. The total mass of the cluster is M = 4.4 kM\u2299, and contains 4% of the gas in the entire Cepheus A region. We find no evidence of an infalling ionized gas stream towards the cluster. We have also derived the cluster's three-dimensional volume, which is V = 16 kpc3. We discuss our results in the context of recent observations of star-forming regions, and in particular of massive clusters."}
{"text":"\n\nIntramolecular long-range correlations in polymer melts: The segmental size distribution and its moments\n\nThe presence of intrachain long-range correlations in polymer melts has been addressed by several authors in the last years. We have developed a new approach which enables us to study in detail the structure of the long-range correlated segmental size distribution. We found that the polymer melt can be in a glassy state, with a broad size distribution, or in a state with long-range correlations, with a much narrower size distribution. We have also found that the width of the size distribution is very sensitive to the thermal history, and that it can be reduced by cooling the melt very fast, and by subsequent slow cooling. Furthermore, we have found that the shape of the size distribution can be very well described by a power law, with a strong temperature dependence of the exponent. We have also found that the moments of the distribution, as well as the correlations between different parts of the size distribution, are very well described by a model which includes the corrections due to the finite size of the system and due to the decoration of the chains on the reference lattice."}

{"text":"\n\nWe systematically search for 7-colourings of the grid in which no two adjacent squares have the same colour. We show that every such 7-colouring can be obtained from a 3-colouring of the grid by adding two rows and two columns, each of which has all seven colours. We show further that the number of such 7-colourings is equal to the number of ways to 3-colour the grid such that no two adjacent squares have the same colour and no two rows or columns have the same colour. Thus, the number of 7-colourings of the grid is at most 7!2^3. We show that this number is at most 7!2^3 by exhibiting a 7-colouring of the grid with this property and by proving that no 7-colouring of the grid with this property can have a repeated colour. We also show that there are at most 5!2^3 3-colourings of the grid with the property that no two adjacent squares have the same colour and no two rows or columns have the same colour.

{"text":"\nWe propose a new type of elastic shell which consists of a constant thickness core and a variable thickness peripheral portion. This shell is designated as a thin elastic shell with variable thickness (TESWT). TESWT can be thought of as a kind of sandwich shell which has an additional layer in the outermost portion of the shell. This outermost layer has a thickness which varies along the boundary of the shell as well as in the direction normal to the boundary. In this paper, we show that the TESWT shell is a generalization of the Reissner-Mindlin shell. We obtain a closed-form solution for a circular TESWT shell which has a power-law variation of the outermost layer. This closed-form solution is a generalization of the known closed-form solutions for the Reissner-Mindlin shell and the recently proposed thin elastic shell with constant thickness (TESCT) shell. The obtained closed-form solution is used to investigate the effect of the variable thickness of the outermost layer on the flexural response of the TESWT shell. It is shown that the TESWT shell has a more stable response to axisymmetric boundary loads than the TESCT shell. We also derive an analytical expression for the thickness of the TESWT shell in terms of the geometry and the mechanical properties of the shell."}
{"text":"\nWe present a comprehensive analysis of the four greatest X-ray flares ever observed from the magnetar CXOU J164710.2-455216 in Westerlund 1. These extraordinary flares were discovered in a one-week monitoring campaign in April 2018. The observed energy distribution in the flares is well described by an exponentially cut-off power law with a cutoff energy of 2.2 kJ. This energy distribution is consistent with the temperature distribution in the flaring magnetosphere, suggesting that the flares were produced by magnetic reconnection in the magnetosphere. We show that the energy released in the flares is much larger than the spin-down power of the magnetar, indicating that the magnetic energy in the magnetosphere is deposited by the magnetic field of the companion star. We find that the occurrence of such flares is a rare event in magnetars with a well-developed magnetosphere, and that the probability of occurrence decreases with increasing magnetic field and volume of the magnetosphere. Our results suggest that magnetic reconnection is an important process in the magnetosphere of magnetars, and can lead to the occurrence of flares with an energy content of up to 6% of the stellar mass of our Sun."}
{"text":"\nWe present an analysis of the redshifts of galaxies in clusters of galaxies (COGs) associated with three nearby active galactic nuclei (AGN). We find that the galaxies in these COGs have redshifts that are systematically higher than the galaxies in a control sample of clusters with no associated AGN. The average redshift of the galaxies in the COGs associated with an AGN is higher by 1.1%. After correcting for the mean redshift of the clusters, the difference in the redshifts between the two samples is still statistically significant at the 3\u03c3 level. We also present the results of a statistical analysis of the distribution of the galaxies in the COGs. We find that the distribution of galaxies in the COGs associated with an AGN is not statistically different from the distribution of galaxies in the control sample. These results suggest that there may be an intrinsic component to the redshifts of the galaxies in the COGs associated with an AGN that may be due to the relative motion of the galaxies in the cluster and the recession of the cluster from us. We discuss our results in the context of the other work in this area."}
{"text":"\nWe present new observations of the light curves of all nine dwarf Plutonian planets discovered to date, together with additional observations of large Kuiper Belt objects (KBOs) 2012 HZ102 and 2015 DP107, and the previously unobserved far-off KBO 2014 XQ17. We have combined these observations with previous data for a total of 21 Plutonian planets and 22 KBOs, including 16 large KBOs with diameters greater than 1000 km, over the period 2011-2018. We find that all nine dwarf Plutonian planets are rotationally symmetric, apart from Pluto which has a large heart-shaped region of surface albedo. The shapes of the light curves of the Plutonian planets are consistent with a single- layered ice shell, with a likely additional rocky core in at least the largest members. We find no evidence of a large, high-albedo region on the surface of any of the Plutonian planets. The 'edge-on' albedo of the distant KBOs is, on average, about 15 percent higher than their 'face-on' albedo. This is consistent with a model in which the albedo is higher on the trailing hemisphere, where the accretion rate is higher. We find that the photometric phase function of large KBOs can be well described by a power law with a single power law index for all objects, except for one object (2014 XQ17) which has a shallower phase function than all the others. The absolute magnitude of the Plutonian planets is found to be consistent with a single- layered ice shell with a likely additional rocky core in at least the largest members. The absolute magnitude of the large KBOs is consistent with a high-albedo surface, an ice shell with a low-albedo interior, and a likely rocky core in at least the largest members."}
{"text":"\n\nU Geminorum: a test case for orbital parameters determination\n\nA fundamental step in the study of a star's evolution is the determination of its orbital elements. These parameters are usually obtained from theoretical models based on the observed properties of the star, assuming that it follows a circular orbit. In this work we present a test case for the determination of orbital parameters of a chemically peculiar star, U Geminorum. We use high-resolution spectroscopy, photometry, and astrometry to derive the orbital elements of the star. The method is based on the analysis of the behaviour of the atmospheric structure, as revealed by the different absorption and emission lines in the stellar spectrum, in relation to the motion of the star around its orbit. We found that U Geminorum has a slightly eccentric orbit, with many close encounters with the inner boundary of the main connotation. The obtained orbital elements are in agreement with those derived from a previous study based on Hipparchus' method."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a spectral analysis of the Chandra observations of comets in the COBE\/FIR Colebrook-Ricalton galaxies survey. The data set consists of 27, Fran\u00e7ois and 26, Hyakutake, and has a total on-source exposure time of about 2000 ks. We find that the comet light curves can be well described by a power law with a cut-off exponential, A \u221d t^(n) exp(-t\/T), where t is the observed time, A is the magnitude, n is the power law index, and T is the exponential cut-on time. The index n is in the range from 1 to 3, and T is typically in the range from 5 ks to 10 ks. The goodness of fit is typically better than 0.9. We derive the tailward extent, W, from the best fit parameters for each comet, and find that it is typically several thousand kilometers. We also derive the total radiated kinetic energy, E, and find that it is typically in the range from 10^36 to 10^37 J. For the brightest comets, we estimate the comet's gas production rate, Q, from the observed luminosity, L, using the relation L \u221d \u03c0 r^2 dQ\/v, where r is the radius, d is the distance, and v is the heliocentric velocity. We find that Q is in the range from 3 \u00d7 10^19 to 1 \u00d7 10^20 cm3 s^(\u22121), and that it is anti-correlated with the comet's gas to dust ratio, with the highest values (and the most dusty comets) having the lowest gas production rates. We also find that Q is correlated with the comet's orbital eccentricity, with the highest values having the most eccentric orbits. We discuss these results in the context of the current theories of comet luminosity, and find that our observations are consistent with a model in which the energy radiated by the comet is controlled by the rate at which gas is produced, provided that the comet has a relatively long tail."}
{"text":"\nWe study the problem of realizing a cosmological constant in a conformally coupled phantom cosmology. We show that the easiest way to achieve this is to follow a route that starts with aphantom cosmology with a positive cosmological constant and an attraction-only gravity, and then consider the cosmological constant to be due to a repulsion from an exactly balanced pairwise force. The route is motivated by the fact that in the regime of strong gravity the dominant contribution to the conformal coupling is the Einstein- Gauss term, which is proportional to the gravitational flux, and that this term can be made to be strictly positive by using a phantom cosmology with a positive cosmological constant and an attraction-only gravity. We show that this is the only way to ensure that the conformal coupling will not flip the sign of the cosmological constant. As a byproduct we also show that the effective Einstein-Infeld gravity in this regime has a Weyl-like self-coupling that can be made arbitrarily small by an appropriate choice of the parameters. We comment on the fact that the standard Einstein- Gauss term is proportional to the flux, not the gradient of the flux, which may have some consequences for the problem of identifying the gravity theory with a suitable cosmology."}
{"text":"\n\nSupernovae (SNe) can have a profound impact on their host galaxies, but their effects on planets and planetary systems are difficult to ascertain, in part because the exact three-dimensional (3D) structure of the SN ejecta is not known. Here we present a numerical model of the interaction of SN ejecta with nearby protoplanetary disks. We find that the SN shock wave can reach the disk surface in as little as 6 kpc, and can deposit a large amount of gas and dust, potentially creating an accretion burst. We show that the strength of this accretion burst depends sensitively on the disk's tilt angle, with much stronger bursts occurring if the disk is inclined with respect to the SN ejecta. We also find that the SN ejecta can create long-lasting turbulence in the disk, with the strength of this turbulence depending sensitively on the disk's properties. Our results suggest that SNe can have a significant impact on the evolution of nearby protoplanetary disks, and could potentially be responsible for triggering accretion events and subsequent planet formation."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present high-precision radial velocities for a sample of 25 Type Ia supernovae (SNe) discovered in the past decade, with an emphasis on local SNe. We show that their peculiar velocities (V peculiar) have a significant systematic offset from the systemic velocity of their host galaxies, with most SNe exhibiting V peculiar > 1000 km s^-1. We explain this offset by a combination of projection effects and a correlation between V peculiar and the orbital velocity of the SN progenitor system about the galactic center. We show that a simple model in which SNe are born in eccentric orbits and are accelerated by gravitational interactions with their host galaxies can quantitatively reproduce the observed correlation, thus providing a possible explanation for the origin of V peculiar. We estimate that the peculiar motions of SNe will have a negative impact on the ability of future galaxy redshift surveys to measure the scale factor and the matter density of the Universe, and we quantify this effect for the case of the Hubble Space Telescope's proposed Ultra Deep Field survey."}
{"text":"\n\nWe study a temperature-driven transition from the Wigner Crystal to the Bond-Charge-Density Wave in the quasi-one-dimensional quarter-filled band. We use the nonequilibrium Green's function technique within the framework of the effective two-dimensional Ising model with a random bond-angle distribution. Our approach is exact and takes into account the finite size of the system. The parameters of the random bond-angle distribution are such that the system is in the thermodynamic equilibrium at zero temperature, and the nonequilibrium ground state has a Wigner crystal structure. We determine the temperature dependence of the real-space structure, the spectral function, and the linear-response function. We find that the transition to the Bond-Charge-Density Wave is continuous and occurs at a finite temperature, T^{*}, which depends on the parameters of the random bond-angle distribution. Our result for T^{*} is consistent with the theory of the random-bond Ising model with a finite number of bonds."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a statistical analysis of the optical luminosity function of Type-1 active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the VVDS survey. The faint end of the luminosity function (LF) is well described by a power law with a exponential cut-off. The power law index and the cut-off magnitude are found to be dependent on the object's redshift, with the index increasing and the cut-off magnitude decreasing with redshift. We interpret this evolution as a signature of the progressive fading of the AGN's accretion power with redshift. We find that this fading is in good agreement with the simple model in which the accretion power is given by the radioactive decay of the accretion disc's mass. Based on this model, we derive the scale length of the accretion disc and find that it increases with redshift in agreement with observations. We also analyse the median and the scatter of the observed LF and find that they are in good agreement with the model prediction. The observations are consistent with a simple model in which the fading of the accretion power is due to the radioactive decay of the accretion disc's mass."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a systematic study of the correlation of diffuse optical light with cluster properties in 52 clusters of galaxies selected from the redshift range 0.1 < z_cluster < 1.3. We find a strong correlation between the total diffuse light in a cluster and the stellar mass of the cluster galaxies, with a scatter of \u223c0.4 dex. This correlation is seen in clusters of galaxies in which the dominant galaxy population is formed by galaxies with intermediate stellar mass (log(M\u22c5star\/Mpc2) \u223c1.5), but is not significant in clusters with dominant galaxies of high or low stellar mass. We find that the correlation between the total diffuse light and stellar mass is largely driven by the correlation of the inter-galactic hydrogen light with stellar mass. The scatter in the correlation is consistent with the scatter in the measurement of the cluster galaxies' stellar mass, and it is not reduced when the clusters are divided into groups with similar stellar mass. We show that the scatter in the correlation is significantly higher when clusters contain anisotropic gas distributions, clusters with higher mean surface brightness, and clusters in which the galaxies are more ordered. We show that the correlation between the total diffuse light and stellar mass is consistent with a simple model in which the diffuse light arises from a scaling law with the stellar mass of galaxies and a correlation length that is proportional to the cluster scale. We show that the correlation length for diffuse light in clusters is longer than the correlation length for the large-scale structure in clusters, and that this correlation length varies in a way that is consistent with the variations in the correlation length for the large-scale structure. We conclude that the diffuse light in clusters is a signature of the large-scale structure in clusters."}
{"text":"\nWe study stochastic fluctuations in metabolic pathways. We consider a generic class of metabolic pathways which we term template-based pathways. These pathways are represented by a template which is a directed graph with real-valued edge weights. The template is instantiated with concrete chemical reactions to produce a concrete pathway. We show that the theory of random walks on directed graphs can be used to study stochastic fluctuations in such pathways. We consider two types of random walks. A simple random walk on the template of a pathway follows each edge of the template with a probability equal to the weight of the edge. A random walk on the pathway itself is defined by replacing each edge of the template by a random walk on the corresponding chemical reaction network. We show that the latter type of random walk has a detailed balance condition. We use a mean-field approach to analyze the simple random walk. We find that the simple random walk has two modes of residence on the template, one of which corresponds to a random walk on the pathway. We use the detailed balance condition to analyze the random walk on the pathway. We show that this walk has a simple expression in terms of the edge weights of the template and the Markov transition matrix of the reaction network. We use this expression to derive a simple condition which guarantees that the random walk on the pathway visits each edge of the template exactly once."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present the results of a new search for transits by giant planets in the solar-like star NGC 6791. We have previously reported two transit events in this star, which were attributed to a giant planet with an orbit very similar to that of our own Jupiter. Here we present two more transit events observed in 2019 and 2021, as well as additional transit data for the previously reported events. The new transit events are very similar to the previously reported events, indicating that the giant planet has an orbit with a radius of 1.5\u20132.0 astronomical units, an orbital period 11\u201312 years, and a mass at least 1.5 times that of Jupiter. The combined data set is consistent with a giant planet in a circular orbit, but the transient nature of the transit events and the relatively small number of observations (nine transit events observed in four different years) make a precise determination of the orbital elements impossible. The continued observation of this star is needed to properly characterize the giant planet and its orbit."}
{"text":"\n\nVery Massive Stars in High-Redshift Galaxies\n\nWe present observations of extremely massive star formation in galaxies at high redshift, providing a powerful probe of the star formation history in the Universe. We have found a population of galaxies at intermediate redshift (z < 1) that are forming stars at an extraordinary rate. These galaxies contain massive stars with very high stellar mass growth rates, suggesting that they have formed most of their stellar mass in a very short period of time. These massive stars have not been seen before at such high redshift, and they provide a critical link between our current theories of massive star formation and the very early Universe. We have determined the redshift and stellar mass of these galaxies, and found that they are typically in the range of 10\u201330 billion years old and are forming stars at a rate of 50\u2013500 solar masses per year. This is much higher than the current rate of star formation in the Universe, which is estimated to be in the range of 3\u201310 solar masses per year. We have also found that these galaxies are much more massive than the galaxies that are forming stars at a lower rate. The massive stars in these galaxies are providing a powerful probe of the history of star formation in the Universe, and they provide a critical link between our current theories of massive star formation and the very early Universe."}
{"text":"\n\nExploiting Social Annotation for Automatic Resource Discovery\n\nWe present a new framework for improving the quality of automatic resource discovery processes by exploiting social annotation. The framework is evaluated on a benchmark of existing methods using a gold standard test set. The experimental results show that the proposed framework achieves a substantial improvement in terms of F-score and average precision.\n\nWe motivate the research by observing that although the amount of information available on the Web is constantly increasing, it is becoming harder to find the relevant information resources that are truly worth the time spent to consult them. We propose that social annotation, i.e., the practice of attaching metadata to resources to describe and semantically characterize them, can be effectively exploited to this end. We then present the key ideas and the methodology that we have followed to develop the framework. In particular, we present the algorithms that we have designed and implemented for the automatic detection of relevant metadata and the evaluation of the framework. We conclude the paper by discussing the results we have obtained and by outlining some possible future research directions."}
{"text":"\n\nPersonalizing Image Search Results on Flickr\n\nWe present an algorithm to personalize image search results on Flickr. We identify four factors that affect users' interaction with search results: visual features of images, textual features of captions and tags, the user's search history, and the social context of the user and the image. We then present a series of experiments to evaluate the impact of these factors on users' engagement with search results. Our experiments use a combination of controlled crowdsourced experiments on Amazon Mechanical Turk and analysis of user data from the Flickr search engine. We find that (1) there is no single dominant factor that improves engagement with search results; (2) personalized search results that take into account multiple factors can be significantly better than the non-personalized results; and (3) there exist \"best\" combinations of factors for different types of queries. We discuss the practical and theoretical implications of our work, and future research directions."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a new algorithm for computing two-player Nash equilibria in finite games. Our algorithm is guaranteed to find a solution (if one exists) in a finite number of steps, and therefore provides a clear and strict guarantee for the existence of a Nash equilibrium. We also present an accompanying proof technique for our algorithm which enables us to design a general purpose algorithm, as well as specific algorithms for particular classes of games. We demonstrate the practicality of our algorithm by computing the Nash equilibria for several example games.\n\nIn the course of our work, we have developed several new ideas which we believe will be of independent interest. One of our main results is a general purpose algorithm for finding a directed acyclic graph which represents the minimum degree prioritization of a graph. We show how this algorithm can be used to compute the Nash equilibria for a wide range of games. Another of our main results is a technique for using the theory of graph decomposition to design a specific algorithm for a particular class of games.\n\nIn addition, we show how the concept of relative equilibrium can be used to design an algorithm for computing the Nash equilibria of a particular class of games, and how our algorithm can be modified to produce a new general purpose algorithm for computing the Nash equilibria of any game. Finally, we show how the concept of a spanning tree can be used to design a general purpose algorithm for computing the Nash equilibria of a particular class of games.\n\nThe practical importance of computing Nash equilibria is illustrated by our ability to use our algorithm to extract the essential elements of a solution to the n-person game of lemons."}
{"text":"\nWe study the equation of state in relativistic magnetohydrodynamics with a variable versus a constant adiabatic index. The variable index formulation is derived by employing the conservation of energy, and the constant index case is derived by employing the conservation of helicity. We solve the resulting equations numerically, and compare the behavior of the solutions for the two cases. The principal difference is that the solution in the variable index case is more constrained, in the sense that the density and temperature are not allowed to simultaneously increase or decrease along a streamline. In the constant index case, this constraint is relaxed. Our results show that the difference between the two cases is significant only in a limited range of physical parameters, and that outside this range the two equations of state are equivalent. The main practical application of our results is that they provide a simple test for the adiabatic index, by checking whether the solution to the variable index equation is inadmissible."}
{"text":"\nThe motivation for this work is to understand the physical and electrical mechanisms that govern the electron emission from carbon nanotube thin film field emitting diode (Thin Film FED) in order to improve the efficiency and long-term stability of the device. The key idea is to use multiphysics modeling to investigate the dynamic behavior of the electron emission process. The methodology is based on the combination of hydrodynamic and ballistic models. The results obtained from the simulation show that the hydrodynamic model can explain the observed current-voltage characteristics of the Thin Film FED, and the ballistic model can be used to predict the emission current density as a function of the electric field strength. The practical application of this work is to design and optimize the structure of the Thin Film FED in order to achieve high emission current density and long-term stability.

{"text":"\n\nDemographics of Transition Objects\n\nWe present a formal definition of the concept of a transition object, one which is motivated by a practical need for a sharper understanding of this key concept in object-oriented programming. Our definition encompasses the common usage of the term, but also formalizes a set of properties that are desired for a good transition object. A key observation is that a transition object should represent a transformation that has an inverse. We present an algebraic characterization of this property, in terms of a bijection between the set of values produced by the transformation and the set of argument values that can be provided to the inverse. This characterization allows us to define a procedure for checking whether an object is a transition object.\n\nWe have applied our definition to the study of the demographics of transition objects. We show that the set of transition objects is stratified, with each layer of the strata having a distinct and well-defined set of properties. We give a classification of the layers, and show how they relate to each other. We also present a formal theory of the partial orderings that can be defined on the set of transition objects, and relate these to the theory of frames.\n\nOur work has several practical implications. A chief one is that it provides a clear and unambiguous characterization of the properties that an object must have in order to be a transition object. This characterization can be used to construct a set of tests that can be applied to objects to determine if they are transition objects. This could be used, for example, to develop a tool for automatically identifying transition objects in a system. Our work also gives a clear and well-defined basis for further research in this area, and provides a foundation for a more rigorous theory of object-oriented systems."}

{"text":"\n\nWe study dislocation dynamics in a Peierls-Nabarro relief model. The model consists of a continuum of dislocations that are able to annihilate each other and a small Peierls-Nabarro region, which is considered as a boundary condition. We use the domain decomposition method to solve the resulting nonlinear boundary value problem. We find that for a small dislocation density the system has a uniaxial ground state with a unique direction of the dislocation pile-up. In a thermodynamic approximation the dislocation pile-up direction does not depend on the initial conditions. We analyze the effect of a external strain on the system and find a counter-intuitive behavior of the dislocation pile-up: for a tensile strain the dislocations pile-up in the direction opposite to the strain direction and for a compressive strain the dislocations pile-up in the strain direction. The explanation of this effect is a combination of a twisting and bending of the dislocation pile-up region. In the case of a tensile strain this has the effect of a negative Peierls-Nabarro stress and in the case of a compressive strain it has the effect of a positive Peierls-Nabarro stress.

{"text":"\n\nWe have carried out a detailed study of the energy distribution of the cosmic rays produced in supernova remnants. Our analysis includes both the absolute intensity and the relative intensity as a function of energy. The energy distribution of the cosmic rays in supernova remnants is found to be described by a power law with a cut-off at the MeV energies. This cut-off energy is found to be in the range 0.6-1.5 MeV, with a mean value of 1.1 MeV. This is consistent with the production of cosmic rays by thermal runaway in the shock wave and with the subsequent decay of the radioisotopes produced in this process. The results are consistent with the assumption that the relative intensity of the cosmic rays produced in a supernova remnant is inversely proportional to the supernova remnant's age. Our findings are consistent with a single, universal curve describing the energy distribution of the cosmic rays produced in all supernova remnants, regardless of the type of the supernova or the nature of the interstellar medium through which the rays have propagated. The energy distribution of the cosmic rays in the supernova remnant SN 1987A is found to be described by a power law with a cut-off at the MeV energies, in agreement with our model. The present observations do not allow us to determine the absolute intensity of the cosmic rays in the supernova remnant SN 1987A, but we estimate that it is in the range 0.08-0.25 erg cm-2 s-1. The present observations also do not allow us to place an upper limit on the energy distribution of the cosmic rays in the supernova remnant SN 1987A."}
{"text":"\nWe present the results of a unique optical spectroscopy survey of a well-studied sample of 42 extremely high energy (EHE) peaked BL Lacertae objects. Our sample consists of sources with extremely high optical variability, a large number of which have known X-ray binaries. We have obtained spectroscopy, with a resolution of $\\sim 1\\%$, of these sources in three different bands ($\\sim 4300$, $\\sim 5500$, and $\\sim 6300$ nm) with the aim of investigating the nature of the absorbing material in these sources, and the distribution of the absorbing material in the inner accretion disk. We find that in the cases where the absorbing material has a well-defined edge, a 1-dimensional (1D) model can well describe the data, thus allowing us to derive the optical depth of the absorbing material. In all cases the optical depth of the absorbing material is $\\sim 2-3$. We find that in the majority of our objects the absorbing material is located in a relatively narrow layer, at a few gravitational radii from the central engine. In one case, however, we find that the absorbing material is much more extended, and a 2-dimensional (2D) model is needed to describe the data. Our results are consistent with a model where the absorbing material is the result of a wind-driven accretion flow, and indicate that the inner accretion disk is only slightly truncated by the presence of the absorbing material. We discuss our results in the framework of a simple model, which allows us to explain the main features of our data."}
{"text":"\nWe consider spheroidal and torsional modes of quasistatic shear oscillations in the solid globe models of nuclear physics and pulsar astrophysics. The problem is reduced to the study of the frequency-dependent shear modulus, C, in a spheroidal shell of uniform thickness. We show than nonzero values of C can be obtained only if the thickness of the shell is equal to a quarter of the wavelength of the corresponding spheroidal mode. This condition can be satisfied only for a limited set of frequencies corresponding to the so-called edge modes. We also found a simple expression for the frequency-dependent shear modulus in terms of the Laplace transform of the solution to the three-dimensional Love wave equation in a spheroidal shell. The resulting expression for C is very similar to the one obtained by transfer matrices method for the propagation of flexural waves in a thin-walled tube. Our result for the shear modulus also implies that the frequency-dependent bulk modulus in a solid sphere is equal to the shear modulus in a thin-walled tube with the same wall thickness and density."}
{"text":"\nWe present observations of the transient ultra-compact X-ray binary 1A 1246-588, consisting of a black hole with a mass of approximately 10 solar masses and a companion star with a mass of approximately 1 solar mass. The black hole is one of the few with a spin period shorter than the orbital period, and as a result, the system exhibits extreme quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in its accretion dynamics. We observed the source with a dedicated observational campaign with the XMM-Newton Observatory, which was triggered by a January 2012 notification from the Monitor of Allsky X-ray Image (MAXI) on board the International Space Station, and find that the source is in a bright and stable outburst. We observe a 1258 Hz high-amplitude kilohertz QPO with a variability amplitude of $\\sim 10^{-3}$. The observed frequency is stable on timescales of hours, but we also find a longer-term frequency evolution, with a decrease in frequency of $\\sim 2 \\times 10^{-9}$ per day. We estimate the black hole spin frequency to be $\\sim 800 Hz$. Our observations are consistent with a simple model in which the spin frequency of the black hole is a constant, and the observed QPO frequency is related to the orbital period through a constant ratio."}
{"text":"\n\nWe investigate theoretically and numerically a new type of surface gap soliton that is driven to propagate along a nonlinearity interface. We show that such solitons can be stabilized by a periodic spatial modulation of the nonlinearity, which plays the role of a ghost trap. We derive a simple stability condition in terms of the symmetries of the nonlinearity and we use this condition to design a one-dimensional (1D) ghost trap with a periodic strength of nonlinearity. We show that this 1D ghost trap can be extended to two dimensions (2D) to stabilize a wide class of solitons, including vortices and extreme solitons. The theory is confirmed by numerically finding stable solutions for a large class of initial conditions. We show that these solitons can be used to transmit information and we propose an algorithm to perform this information transmission. We also show that, in the case of a quasi-1D ghost trap, the information transmission is very robust with respect to a small deformation of the ghost trap, in a similar way to the transmission of information by optical fibers."}
{"text":"\nWe present here results of a pilot study of the statistical properties of blazars in data from the WMAP and Swift satellite missions, with a view to understanding the nature of the blazar population as a whole. We find that the number density of blazars in the universe is consistent with a random distribution, with a magnitude-limited sample volume variance of 1.6$. This is in agreement with the results of the Two Micron All Sky Survey, but in disagreement with the result of the F-GAMMA survey, which found the blazar number density to be 2.5 times higher in galaxies with metallicities similar to the Milky Way than in galaxies with lower metallicities. We also find that the blazars in our sample follow a power law distribution in flux, with a power law index of -1.92 +-0.06, in agreement with the result of the F-GAMMA survey. The probability distribution of flux variations is well described by a lognormal distribution with a standard deviation equal to the square root of the mean flux density, suggesting that flux variability is driven by a single power law distribution of flux. We find no evidence for a correlation between flux and radio power, either within a given blazar or between blazars. We discuss these results in the context of models of blazar formation and evolution, and of the relationship between blazars and their host galaxies."}
{"text":"\n\nWe show that the entropies of certain empirical processes satisfy power inequalities which are independent of the probability measure. In particular, the inequality is satisfied by the entropies of finite Markov chains with strictly positive entry probabilities and by the entropies of random walks on simple graphs. We show further that the entropies of Markov chains with positive entry probabilities satisfy a strict inequality if the chains are constrained to have a small number of states. As a by-product, we show that the number of non-zero terms in the entropy expansion of a Markov chain with positive entry probabilities is at most equal to the number of states. We phrase our results in the language of information theory as follows. Let $\\Phi$ be a finitary empirical process with entropy $h$. We show that there exists an $x$ such that for every $t$, $h(x) \\geqslant h(t) + x^2\\ln(x)$, where $x$ is the Fisher information.

{"text":"\n\nWe present a study of galaxy evolution and the environment using the largest galaxy catalogue containing galaxies at intermediate redshift (z < 1). We have selected galaxies in a half-square degree survey with three independent colour selection criteria, and have derived the galaxy's photometric redshift from the observed colour. The selection criteria are designed to select galaxies in a given colour range and to avoid galaxies which are blended with a bright neighbour. The photometric redshifts have been validated with a large sample of spectroscopically-selected galaxies. We present the catalogue of 4dF redshift selected galaxies, and a statistical analysis of the data. We find that at these redshifts galaxy morphology is tightly coupled to star formation history, and that galaxies are still evolving, although at a slower pace. We also find that the environment in which galaxies evolve has a significant influence on the morphology and star formation history of galaxies. In particular, we find that the importance of the environment depends on the galaxy's current morphological type and on its star formation history. The detailed analysis of the results is presented in a series of papers."}
{"text":"\nWe introduce a general framework for the study of semi-simple submanifolds of flag manifolds. Flag manifolds are semi-simple by definition, so the question of simplicity is settled. However, they are also specified by a partition into subspaces, which can be nontrivial. We show that a generic semi-simple submanold of a flag manifold is a partially-flagged submanifold, i.e., it is a submanifold of the flag manifold on which the restriction of the flagging remains a flagging. We consider several classes of semi-simple submanifolds which have natural motivations from the theory of discrete semi-simple submanifolds of Lie groups. In particular, we show that any such submanifold is a partially-flagged submanold. We show that a submanifold of a flag manifold is a partially-flagged submanifold if and only if it is an inclusion of a subspace of the flag manifold. This answers a question of Greene, and provides a necessary and sufficient condition for a submanold to be a partially-flagged submanold."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a diagnostic study of a sample of infrared luminous galaxies (ILGs) selected from the Spitzer Survey of Stellar Structure in Galaxies at z~2, using the Spitzer Mid-Infrared Spectrograph (SMIRS) to measure the gas mass and the stellar mass. We find that the gas mass of these ILGs is, on average, only 1.4 times the stellar mass, and that the distribution of gas masses is well described by a power law with a linear regression fit of the form log(gas mass\/stellar mass) = 1.29 + 0.52(stellar mass)^{-0.37}, where the stellar mass is expressed in units of $10^{10} \\ M_{\\odot}$. This is consistent with a simple model in which the gas mass is a constant fraction (1.4) of the stellar mass, regardless of the galaxy's absolute magnitude, density, or star formation rate (SFR). The model also predicts that the minimum gas mass is equal to the stellar mass, and that the gas mass increases superlinearly with the stellar mass. We discuss the implications of our results for models of galaxy formation and evolution."}

We estimate the companion masses from radial velocity measurements. We show that the probability distribution of the companion masses is strongly skewed to higher masses. The mean mass is close to the minimum mass for a gas giant, but a large fraction of the population has a mass above this threshold. These companions are not gravitationally bound, and are likely to have formed through the fragmentation of a larger planet.

{"text":"\n\nWe present a numerical investigation of satellite galaxies, their merging and their relation to the dark and stellar halos of their hosts. We find that satellite galaxies are not immortal, but survive on average only 1.4 Gyr, with a survival probability of 0.6. Satellite galaxies are more likely to merge with their hosts than to be tidally disrupted by them. We show that the location of the satellite within the host's potential field and the mass of the satellite are the main factors governing the probability of a satellite to merge with its host. We find that most satellite galaxies are still accreting at the time of their disruption by the host and that only a small fraction of them is disrupted because they have stopped accreting. The accretion rate of a satellite is not a decisive factor for its survival. We also discuss the relation of satellite galaxies to the stellar and dark halos of their hosts and find that only satellite galaxies in very specific locations are able to provide significant amounts of stellar mass to the host's stellar halo."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present photometric and spectroscopic data for a large sample of F and G dwarf stars in the solar neighbourhood, with the aim of investigating the relation between the properties of these stars and their evolutionary status. Our sample consists of 92 F and G dwarfs with known orbital elements and absolute photometric magnitudes, which we combine with broadband photometry and high-resolution spectroscopy from the UVES and FIES spectrographs on the ESO VLT. We find that the kinematic properties of these stars are consistent with two different prescriptions: (i) a spherically symmetric potential field with a radial distribution of masses according to the thin disc approximation, and (ii) a potential field created by the migration of massive bodies from the parent molecular cloud. In both cases, the velocity field is well described by a single set of parameters, which we determine from the analysis of the data. The derived parameters are consistent with the predictions of both the thin disc and the migration models, although the latter is able to provide a slightly better description of the data. We discuss the evolutionary status of our sample stars in the light of our results, and we draw conclusions on the mechanisms that regulate the dynamical evolution of the Galactic disc."}
{"text":"\n\nCosmic M'enage \\`a Trois: The Origin of Satellite Galaxies On Extreme Orbits\n\nWe present a cosmological model that naturally accounts for the origin and distribution in space of the satellite galaxies that surround a main galaxy. Our model is based on the dynamics of three different populations of dark matter halos, each of which is capable of hosting a satellite galaxy. The main galactic halo is a large and massive object, with a high concentration of matter in the centre. The halo is surrounded by a much shallower layer of dark matter, called the \\\"halo outskirts.\\\" Outside this layer is a third layer, called the \\\"cosmological feedback\\\" and it is this layer that is responsible for the origin of satellite galaxies. In our model, the most massive halos are able to form satellite galaxies by the accretion of gas and galaxies from the cosmological feedback layer. We find that the satellites are most easily formed by the accretion of gas, while the accretion of galaxies requires a much more massive halo. The natural explanation for the lack of satellites in a galaxy like the Milky Way, is that the main halo is not massive enough to accrete galaxies from the cosmological feedback layer. We discuss several ways in which our model can be tested, and highlight the fact that galaxies which are extremely far from any main galaxy, could be a probe of the structure of the cosmological feedback layer."}
{"text":"\nWe study the structure of the baryon antidecuplet in the framework of the standard model effective field theory. The motivation for this work is to understand the nature of the various non-standard baryon-number violating processes that have been observed in recent years, such as the \u00a0deuteron electric dipole transition, and the axial-vector transition recently observed by the BaBar collaboration. Our focus is on the structure of the baryon antidecuplet in the framework of the standard model effective field theory, and the conditions under which various non-standard baryon number violating transitions can occur. We find that the standard model alone can account for most of the non-standard baryon number violating transitions that have been observed, with the exception of the \u00a0deuteron electric dipole transition, and the recent axial-vector transition observed by the BaBar collaboration.

{"text":"\n\nHS1857+5144: A hot and young pre-cataclysmic variable\n\nWe present photometric and spectroscopic observations of the pre-cataclysmic variable (PCV) HS1857+5144 obtained during a recent outburst. The system is a member of the galactic globular cluster M3, and is one of the most massive and rapidly rotating PCVs known. We find that the accretion phase lasts several thousand seconds, which is much longer than typical for PCVs. We observe a large number of small-amplitude eclipses during the accretion phase, which we attribute to the fact that the accretion disc is far from being axisymmetric. We estimate the pre- outburst orbital period to be \u223c70 min, and the spin period, which is slightly longer, to be \u223c73 min. The observed spin-up time is much longer than the orbital period, indicating that the system is in a strongly three-frequency Resonance. The total mass and the orbital and spin periods are consistent with a single massive accretion disc, as opposed to a system with two accretion discs in orbit around a common barycenter, which was previously suggested to explain some peculiarities of this system. We discuss the possible physical origin of the non-axisymmetric structure of the accretion disc, and suggest that the long spin-up time is due to the large moment of inertia of the disc, in combination with the relatively weak accretion torque."}
{"text":"\n\nWe propose a framework for joint unicast and multicast QoS routing using soft constraint logic programming. Our framework is based on a generic mechanism that can handle both unicast and multicast routing with the same formalism. In this framework, a router is abstracted as a label-switching device that receives packets with labeled edges and outputs packets with labeled edges. The input and output labeled edges are related by a set of edge-rewrite rules. A rule specifies the conditions for matching an input edge and the resulting output edge. Our framework handles both quality-driven routing and hop-by-hop routing. In quality-driven routing, the rules are selected to achieve a given QoS requirement, while in hop-by-hop routing, the rules are selected to minimize the number of hops or to achieve some other optimization criteria. We present an implementation of our framework using the DISTO principle, which combines decision-theoretic and heuristic methods to obtain near-optimal solutions to resource-constrained problems. The implementation is evaluated using simulation, and the results are compared with those of other protocols."}
{"text":"\nWe present a careful derivation of the Lorentz transformations for the case of a point particle. To this end, we make use of the formalism of geometric algebra. We show that, if the relative velocity is small compared to the speed of light, the ordinary Doppler effect can be obtained as a special case of the general theory. This general theory is applicable to any frame of reference and any velocity, even if the relative velocity tends to infinity. We show that the transformation parameters can be obtained by solving a set of consistent and independent constraints. This set of constraints is a direct consequence of the properties of the non-Euclidean geometry of 4-dimensional spacetime. Therefore our derivation is not based on any assumption about the structure of spacetime, except that it is a 4-dimensional non-Euclidean geometry. We also show that this set of constraints has a simple geometric structure, which is related to the properties of the Lorentzian 4-space. Finally, we discuss the physical significance of the obtained results and the problem they attempt to solve."}
{"text":"\n\nWe investigate the mapping of time-dependent densities onto potentials in quantum mechanics. We show that in the case of a single variable, this mapping can be achieved by a generalization of the celebrated Wigner-Weyl transform. Our approach is based on the use of a generalized Laplace transform, which enables us to map a time-dependent probability distribution onto a time-independent one, in a way which is consistent with the conservation of probability. We show that the use of this mapping does not alter the statistical interpretation of quantum mechanics, and that it preserves the principle of innocent actions. We also show that this mapping can be used to define a new class of quantum states, which includes the Wigner function as a special case. We call these new states generalized Wigner functions. We investigate the properties of generalized Wigner functions, and show that they can be used to model quantum systems which evolve in time in a way which is not described by the traditional approach. We also show that these functions can be related to the Wigner function in a way which preserves the properties of the original function."}
{"text":"\nWe have developed a new method for investigating the internal structure of the nucleon, based on the analysis of the probability distribution of the nucleon's wave function in a large number of spherical shells, concentric with the nucleon center of mass. The method is based on the computation of the overlap between the nucleon wave function and the basis functions of a shells of size R. The resulting quantities, which we call the Core-Shell Amplitudes (CSAs), have a very simple structure, which we analyze in this paper. We find that the CSA can be obtained from a simple chiral model, in which the only degree of freedom is the nucleon longitudinal motion. This model can be viewed as an extension of the quark-meson model, in which the quark antiquark structure is replaced by a antiquark-meson structure. We analyze the structure of the CSA in terms of a set of parameters, which can be directly related to the properties of the chiral model. In this way, we can interpret the structure of the CSA as the consequence of the interplay between the different chiral structures which are present in the nucleon."}

{"text":"\nWe present a unified shear-thinning treatment of both film thickness and traction in EHD. The motivation for the research is that, first, the dewetting transition temperature Td depends on the shear rate, and second, the thickness and traction must be related in a general EHD model. Our key idea is to use the Ma-Leonard model as the basis for the analysis, and to generalize it by using a different expression for the shear-thinning coefficient in each of the two areas of the film where different boundary conditions are applied. We analyze the resulting model analytically and obtain a simple expression for the film thickness. Our methodology is in the form of a series of assumptions and simplifications, which are stated at the beginning of the paper and which we believe to be physically reasonable. Our results are in good quantitative agreement with previous work. The problem we attempt to solve is how to include the shear-thinning effect in a general EHD model. The practical application of our work is in the design of droplet-based microfluidic devices, where the contact angle and the thickness of the film are important parameters that are affected by the shear-thinning behavior of the fluid. Our findings have theoretical implications for a deeper understanding of the EHD problem, in which the effect of shear-thinning is not yet well-understood."}
{"text":"\n\nWe investigate the effect of electric field (EHD) on the traction properties of liquid lubricants in the superlow traction regime and mixed lubrication regime. We use the flexible multinational bearing experiment to obtain the traction curves of several lubricants in the superlow traction and mixed lubrication regimes. The traction curves exhibit a strong non-monotonic dependence on the EHD strength, which can be explained by the change of the molecular mechanic properties of the lubricants under EHD. We find that the ability of a lubricant to form a film on the surface of the counterpart is the key to the change of the traction properties in the mixed lubrication regime, while the increase of the friction under a higher EHD strength is due to the increasing non-Newtonian behavior of the lubricant in the superlow traction regime. Our work can help understand the change of the traction properties of liquid lubricants under EHD and provide guidance to design EHD-lubricated tribo-systems with superlow traction and\/or mixed lubrication regimes."}
{"text":"\nWe present a phenomenological model for massive neutrinos. The model is based on the idea that the massive neutrinos are weakly coupled to the other Standard Model (SM) particles. We show that the model is able to describe all the neutrino masses, the charged lepton number, and the Yukawa matrix in the SM without any additional parameters. We also show that the model can be used to generate the correct Lorentz structure of the massive neutrinos, provided that the massive neutrinos are generated at a very small scale, much smaller than the Compton wavelength of the SM particles. The Yukawa matrix of the neutrinos is generated dynamically in the model. We show that the massive neutrinos are at least as light as the lightest neutral lepton, and that the model can generate a hierarchy of masses for the neutrinos with a single additional mass parameter. We show that the same mass parameter can be used to generate the correct pattern of the Yukawa matrix for the neutrinos and to make the charged lepton number conservation a good one. The model predicts that the massive neutrinos are able to generate a small but non-zero cosmological constant. We discuss possible experimental tests of the model."}
{"text":"\nWe develop a lowest-order constrained variational method to determine the equation of state (EOS) of atomic systems beyond s-wave, which describes the ground state of the system in terms of a finite set of single-particle basis functions. The method is applied to the case of large scattering length, where the exact EOS is known. The proposed method is rigorous, straightforward, and systematic, and has the advantage that the constraint functional is directly related to the sought-after EOS. We evaluate the exact Muffin-tin basis-function contribution to the constraint functional, and thereby determine the singularity structure of the constraint surface, which reflects the structure of the basis functions. The proposed method can be applied to other physical systems in which the EOS is not known. We show that the lowest-order constrained variational method has the same structure as the recently proposed lowest-order adjoint variational method, but in the latter method the constraint functional is not related to the sought-after EOS."}
{"text":"\nWe present tests of Bayesian model selection techniques for gravitational wave data. Our focus is on the problem of model selection for data containing gravitational waves from multiple sources. We evaluate the ability of the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) and Bayes factor (BF) to distinguish between different models of this data. We find that the BIC is inconsistent and the BF is only marginally consistent with the hypothesis that the correct model is the model that minimizes the BIC or BF. These results suggest that model selection based on the BIC or BF is unlikely to be successful in practice. We also evaluate the performance of model selection using cross-validation. We find that cross-validation is more reliable, although it may still be problematic in practice. Our results suggest that the model selection problem for data containing gravitational waves from multiple sources is non-trivial and that it may be difficult to develop a practical algorithm for model selection in this context."}
{"text":"\nWe propose a new particle transport model in fully developed turbulence with mass loading feedback. Our model is a generalization of the two-dimensional (2-D) Boltzmann-Unger-Cahn (BUC) cascade model for particle transport to the three-dimensional (3-D) case. In the BUC model, the total number of particles is constant, and the mean square displacement is related to the velocity increments by a single parameterization. In our 3-D model, we allow for finite and constant mass source and sink regions. The model is evaluated using direct numerical simulations (DNS) of fully developed turbulence with constant mass sources and sinks in the streamwise direction. The model is shown to capture the large-scale structure of the particle distribution well. We find that the transport coefficients are related to the velocity increments through a power law in the usual 2-D BUC cascade model, with an additional non-trivial correction that is almost constant for the streamwise velocity and increases for the spanwise and wall-normal velocity increments. The model is also extended to take into account the non-local particle transport. Our model is shown to be consistent with the recent measurement of the particle spectrum in a fully developed turbulent boundary layer."}
{"text":"\nWe present a simple model of evolutionary and network dynamics that unify two lines of research that have developed largely independently: evolutionary game theory and network theory. Our model is an extension of the replicator equation to the case of a structured population living on a network. We consider a dynamic game of cooperation on a network, and show how the dynamics of this game can be derived from the replicator equation by making a specific identification between the strategy space and the network structure. We find that the resulting model has several interesting and non-trivial effects that are unique to network dynamics and that are not present in the original replicator equation. In particular, we show that the dynamic evolution of cooperation is related to the efficient equilibrium of the underlying game, in a way that depends on the network structure. We also find that the set of cooperative strategies can be compactly represented by a small subset of the strategy space, which is independent of the network structure. We discuss several examples and applications of our model, and investigate the conditions for a society to converge to a cooperative equilibrium. Our results suggest that the dynamics of cooperation on a network can be effectively captured by a simple model that unifies evolutionary and network dynamics."}
{"text":"\nWe present the second part of the LuckyCam Survey for very low mass binaries. In this work we present 13 new M4.5-M6.0 binarians. We have also updated the mass function for the first part of the survey. The new mass function can be found in the supplemental material of the first part of the survey. With the current sample we can derive the mass function for M4.0-M5.0 objects. The sample contains bins with 13 objects and the most massive star in the system is between 1.01 and 1.36 solar masses. The most massive system in the sample has a systemic mass of 2.01 solar masses, a period of 87.1 minutes, and a semi-major axis of 9.8 solar radii. The median relative solar radii of the systems is 1.12, while the median orbital period is 78.9 minutes. The mass function for M4.0-M5.0 is well described by a power law with a cut-off mass of M\u22c5host = 1.89 \u00b1 0.08 solar masses, which corresponds to an age of 12.6 Gyr. We find a correlation between the orbital elements and the host star mass. The correlation between the semi-major axis and the host star mass can be described by a power law with a cut-off semi-major axis of a\u22c5host = 7.45 \u00b1 0.75 solar radii, which corresponds to an age of 12.2 Gyr. The correlation between the orbital period and the host star mass can be described by a power law with a cut-off orbital period of P\u22c5host = 61.03 \u00b1 12.68 minutes, which corresponds to an age of 11.6 Gyr. This correlation can be used to derive an age estimate for a given very low mass binary system. We found a median orbital period of 78.9 minutes. Systems with longer orbital periods are likely to be older than the ones with shorter orbital periods. We estimated the age of the sample to be 11.6 \u00b1 1.4 Gyr. The derived mass function for M4.0-M5.0 can be used to derive the age of a given very low mass binary. The best fit age is 12.6 Gyr."}
{"text":"\n\nWe introduce a new measure of de Sitter entropy, which can be understood as the probability that a random point in a de Sitter space will remain in a small neighborhood for an arbitrarily long time. This entropy obeys the Area Law, has a non-zero value for any positive cosmological constant, and is positive for any spatially compact region. In addition, it can be shown that the entropy is minimized on de Sitter space. We show that our measure of entropy can be related to the spectrum of the spatial curvature. We use our measure of entropy to study the recent eternal inflationary scenario proposed by Casimirs. In particular, we show that our measure of entropy can be related to the energy density of a scalar field in a certain range of its negative values.

We show that this positive correlation is violated by the recent Casimir's proposal. We discuss the possible implications of our work for the understanding of the dynamics of the early universe."}
{"text":"\nWe present a detailed study of the 100 kpc-scale damped Lyman alpha (DLA) absorption in the direction of a nearby bright QSO (SH100). We aim to use the QSO as a probe to study the properties of galaxies in the early universe. Our main result is that the DLA absorption towards SH100 is formed by two distinct haloes, one at a distance of ~60 kpc and the other at ~40 kpc, which means that the absorbing gas in the system is not distributed in a single halo but rather in two separate structures. The first halo contains gas at a mean redshift of 1.5, while the second halo contains gas at a mean redshift of 1.3. This result suggests that at the time when the QSO was forming (z ~ 3), the IGM was not well mixed on large scales but rather was structured into distinct haloes, some of which were at an intermediate redshift (z ~ 1.5), while others were at a higher redshift (z ~ 1.3). Our results suggest that at this redshift, the IGM was still turbulent and not well mixed. The problem this work attempts to solve is the following: we aim to use the QSO as a probe to study the properties of galaxies in the early universe. The key idea is to measure the properties of the IGM in the direction of the QSO, by observing the DLA absorption. The DLA absorption towards SH100 is a well-known feature, but its origin has been controversial. We aim to resolve the controversy by presenting a detailed study of the DLA absorption. The practical application of our results is that they can be used to study the properties of galaxies in the early universe. Our results suggest that at the time when the QSO was forming (z ~ 3), the IGM was not well mixed on large scales but rather was structured into distinct haloes, some of which were at an intermediate redshift (z ~ 1.5), while others were at a higher redshift (z ~ 1.3)."}
{"text":"\n\nWe reexamine the \"missing satellites problem,\" a fundamental puzzle in reliable computer science, in the light of modern theory. The problem is that although we can use votes from a set of reliable processes to determine whether or not a given process is reliable, we cannot use such votes to identify which process is reliable if there is more than one reliable process. We show that this puzzle can be restated as a property of certain probabilistic voters. In particular, we show that if the voters are any of the usual notion of randomness, or any of the various notions of \"session-key randomness,\" or any of a number of other voters that have been proposed as solutions to this puzzle, then the puzzle is still insoluble. We then show that if the voters are any of a number of probabilistic voters that have not previously been considered, then the puzzle can be solved. We also show that any solution to the puzzle must use voters that do not satisfy the standard requirements for using randomness in a computer program.\n\nThe motivation for our work is that we wish to better understand the boundaries of the notion of reliable computer program. We show that a standard assumption, that a reliable program must not use randomness in a way that is undecidable, is false. We also show that a standard notion of randomness, that of a computer program that outputs a sequence of bits that is statistically close to being uniformly distributed, is not the only useful notion of randomness.\n\nOur work has practical implications for cryptography. In particular, we show that a number of recently proposed cryptographic primitives, including a simple solution to the \" missing satellites problem,\" are not as practical as they might first appear."}
{"text":"\n\nWe introduce a general method to construct low-density graph codes that achieve the optimal rate-distortion performance for a given channel, for a large family of channel models. Our method is based on the use of binning, i.e., on the construction of a smallest bin size that allows to achieve the optimal rate-distortion performance. We first show that for a large class of channels, the optimal bin size is of the order of the optimal block length, and this optimal bin size can be achieved by the use of low-density graph codes. Then, we show that the optimal low-density graph code for this bin size is the sole graph code that is both a valid binning code and an optimal channel code. As an application, we consider the problem of reconstructing a sequence of independent identically distributed binary variables, whose entropy is $\\frac{1}{2}$. We show that any low-density graph code that achieves the optimal rate-distortion performance for this problem is the sole graph code that is also a valid binning code."}
{"text":"\n\nThe S-parameter in Holographic Technicolor Models\nWe present a general method of constructing effective field theories of holography which are invariant under the S-parameter (i.e., the state of the bulk theory with respect to a particular foliation of spacetime). We show that such theories can be constructed by a simple modification of the holographic bulk theory in terms of a finite dimensional representation of the bulk theory's symmetry group. We focus on the case of N=1 gauge theories with a hyperk\u00e4hler bulk theory, and show that the S-parameter is related to the geometric structure of the bulk theory in a way which is analogous to the relationship between the bulk theory and the geometry of spacetime in the case of a \"Positive\" bulk theory. In particular, we show that the bulk theory determines a \"sheaf theory\" on the geometry of spacetime, and that the S-parameter acts as a \"sheaf morphism\" which takes this sheaf theory to a \"singular\" geometric object. We also show that the S-parameter is related to the \"itational\" structure of the bulk theory, in the sense that it maps itational objects in the bulk theory to itational objects in the effective theory. This general approach can be applied to any bulk theory which has a finite dimensional representation of its symmetry group, and is therefore applicable to any N=1 gauge theory with a hyperk\u00e4hler bulk theory, as well as to N=1 gauge theories with a chiral bulk theory, and to any other bulk theory which has a suitable finite dimensional representation of its symmetry group."}

{"text":"\nWe consider squark and gaugino hadroproduction and decays in non-minimal flavour violating supersymmetry. We show that non-standard weak singlet quark and lepton representations can be generated by this theory, and that they are compatible with the standard weak gauge structure. We analyse the hadroproduction of quarks and antiquarks in terms of the standard unitary weak W and Z gauge interactions, and the more general quark-antiquark correlations in terms of the non-standard interactions. The most interesting non-standard weak singlet representations are those which are not related to the standard weak gauge structure. We find that the non-standard representations which are related to the standard weak gauge structure can be obtained from the standard representations by a local gauge transformation which is induced by a change in the mass of the weak singlet quark. The non-standard representations which are not related to the standard weak gauge structure can be obtained by a local gauge transformation which is induced by a change in the quark flavour. We also consider the hadroproduction of squarks and gauginos in a pure gluino model. We show that the hadroproduction of squarks and gauginos in non-minimal flavour violating supersymmetry is different from that in minimal flavour violating supersymmetry. We find that the gaugino can be produced in a pure gluino model with a small probability. We also show that the squark can be produced in a pure gluino model with a large probability, and that its decay products can be in a non-standard flavour representation."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a catalogue of low-resolution near-infrared photometry for 78 of the nearest stars to the Sun, drawn from a database of 5 million pixel images taken with the Hubble Space Telescope's Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer. These data are used to derive the radii, temperatures, and ages of these stars. We find that the confirmed members of the Pleiades, or Seven Sisters, are between 200 and 400 million years old, but that there are many more members in this cluster than are currently listed. A new list of candidate members is presented, including many stars that are more than twice the age of the Sun. We show that many field stars with high proper motion that were previously considered to be members of the Pleiades are instead more distant stars. The ages of the suspected member stars are consistent with a Pleiades age of about 250 million years, with a margin of error of about 50%. This is in agreement with the results of an independent analysis of high-resolution spectroscopy of cluster members. The derived cluster properties are consistent with a simple model in which the cluster has grown by consecutive mergers of Horowitz-Ramsbottom (HR) clouds, the most recent of which was about 250 million years ago.

We find that the mid-infrared colors are consistent with the stars being singly or doubly mantled by dust clouds."}
{"text":"\nWe have performed a systematic study of the evolution of charge ordering and magnetic phase diagram in  half-doped manganites with a low Curie temperature by varying the manganese concentration. Our results show that a substantial charge ordering instability region exists in these manganites, and the ordering is always anti-phase to the magnetic ordering. We have discovered a novel charge ordering state in a low magnetic field, in which the charge disproportion is very weak and the charge transfer is nearly local, in a mechanism we call charge ordering by spin-dependent localization (CSBL). Our results reveal that CSBL is the leading charge ordering mechanism in these manganites, and the weak charge disproportion in this state results from the competition between charge ordering and spin ordering. We also found that the non-magnetic charge ordering state can be stabilized by a large magnetic field, and the resulting charge disproportion is enhanced by the spin-orbital coupling in the magnetic state. Our results provide a novel platform for the study of charge ordering and spin-orbital coupling in metallic manganites."}

The 802.11e MAC has been designed to support Quality of Service (QoS) by means of the Traffic Class (TC) and Access Category (AC) differentiation. This work focuses on the three ACs that are intended for best-effort traffic, i.e., the AC_BK, AC_BE, and AC_VI. The fairness of the 802.11e mechanism has been questioned since the standard was published, particularly with regard to the wireless median access method, which is the most widely used. Our contribution is to shed light on the fairness of the 802.11e wireless medium access and to design a simple modification that improves fairness. To this end, we follow a methodology that includes the measurement of several system parameters and the analysis of their correlation with the fairness notion. Our results show that the 802.11e medium access is not fair in general, and we identify the factors that affect fairness. We then propose a simple modification to the 802.11e medium access procedure that improves fairness, and we analyze its performance."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider the problem of determining the number of edges in a random graph with a given degree sequence. Such a graph is obtained by independently and uniformly selecting the endpoints of each edge, with each edge connecting a pair of distinct endpoints with degree at most one. We show that for every degree sequence, this random graph has a probability of 1 of having an edge number at most twice the number of edges in a complete graph with that degree sequence. We show this by determining a limiting distribution for the number of edges in a growing network with an arbitrary degree sequence and an in-degree limit of one. In particular, the limit has the same distribution as the number of edges in a random graph with the same degree sequence. We show that this limit has a trivial proof using only basic combinatorics if and only if the degree sequence contains at most one element. We also consider the problem of selecting a subgraph of a given size from a growing network, and show that the probability of selecting a subgraph with a given degree sequence approaches 1 as the number of edges grows."}
{"text":"\n\nAbstract for: Shock and Release Temperatures in Molybdenum\n\nWe have developed a new technique to measure the shock and release temperatures in metallic materials at ultra-high strain rates. Our approach is based on measuring the thermal emissions from a heated probe during the shock event. In this paper, we report the results of our experiments for molybdenum. We have tested the measurements across a wide range of initial temperatures, strain rates, and piston\/probe masses. We observe that the shock temperature decreases with increasing initial temperature, increasing strain rate, or increasing probe mass. The release temperature increases with initial temperature, decreases with strain rate, and is not affected by the probe mass. Our measurements are in good agreement with previous works in the literature where either the shock or the release temperature were measured. We show that our technique can be used to measure both temperatures during a single shock event. We discuss the implications of our results for the different mechanisms that are responsible for the energy dissipations at the shock and release fronts and we show that the different behavior of the two temperatures can be explained by a model which takes into account the different effective volumes of the shocked and released material."}
{"text":"\nWe study the order of the two-dimensional (2D) polymer escape transition as a function of the system size and the solvent quality using Monte Carlo simulations. We find a strong dependence of the transition order on the system size and the solvent quality. In particular, we observe a critical system size for the transition, above which the order is absolutely first order, and below which the order is second order. We also find a strong dependence of the order on the solvent quality, where the order is generally first order in a good solvent and second order in a bad solvent. In addition, we study the polymer conformation and the statistical properties of the system as a function of the transition order. We find that the polymers adopt a more compact conformation and the system becomes more ordered in a first-order transition, while the polymers adopt a more extended conformation and the system becomes less ordered in a second-order transition. Our results suggest that the 2D polymer escape transition is generally first order, but can be second order in a small system or in a bad solvent."}
{"text":"\n\nWe investigate the effects of mergers on the scaling relations between black holes, galaxies, and other gravitationally bound systems, taking into account both the relaxation of the Holtzman-Herzog metric and the modifications of the scale-length and scale-mass relationships caused by the dynamic evolution of the system. We find that the relevant length scales change non-monotonically, with the longest length scale increasing for minor mergers and decreasing for major mergers, provided that the total mass of the system is large enough to make the dynamic evolution applicable. We also find that the scaling relations for the total mass are modified in a way that depends on the total number of black holes in the system, with the minimum total mass increasing for minor mergers and decreasing for major mergers. The change is more substantial for systems with many black holes. Our results suggest that the traditional mass-based definition of a black hole does not remain valid after a merger, and that alternative definitions, such as the one based on the individual mass of a black hole or on the total gravitational binding energy, may be preferable."}

The result is exact for any choice of W(z) and has a simple physical interpretation in terms of an oscillating motion of the point-particle in the potential field. We show that the solution is well-defined for a large class of W(z), but that it may fail to exist for some choices of W(z). We also show that the solution is unique in a certain class of W(z), but that it may be non-unique for some choices of W(z). We finally consider the solution to the Klein-Gordon-Hartree equation below the singularity at the origin. We show that this solution is in general non-unique, but that it can be made unique by requiring that the solution is analytic in a neighbourhood of the origin."}
{"text":"\nWe present orbital-free density functional theory (OFDFT) methods that combine exact kinetic energies with local pseudopotential orbitals to accurately and efficiently describe the electronic structure of transition metal complexes.

This parameterization is then used to calculate the kinetic energy for any complex that can be described by a small number of local pseudoatoms. The methods are applied to the calculation of excited states and other properties of several benchmark complexes, and the results are compared to those obtained with the corresponding exact ab initio methods. We also describe a strategy for including correlated orbitals in OFDFT calculations, by means of a mapping of theOGMDfunctional into a series of basis functions that can be evaluated rapidly. This approach is tested on the benchmark systems Morokite and Florescence, and the results are in good agreement with those obtained from full ab initio calculations."}
{"text":"\n\nWe study various aspects of the dynamics of quantum systems after a quench in extended systems. We consider a class ofonic-Remote-Canada-eld- supplemented with additional drive fields-which can be used to investigate the role of spatial symmetry in the dynamics of the system after a quench. We show that the dynamics after a slow or fast quench has different regimes, depending on the symmetry of the initial state. In particular, we show that in one-dimensional systems a fast quench can drive the system to a new state, while in higher-dimensional systems it cannot. In one-dimensional systems, the new state is a superposition of all symmetry states, while in higher-dimensional systems it is the unique ground state of the corresponding thermodynamic system. We also consider the case of a fast quench in a one-dimensional model which has a continuously tunable symmetry. In this case we show that the dynamics after a quench is given by a sequence of governed by the quenching rate, the initial state, and the symmetry of the model. We also derive a simple formula which describes the evolution after a slow quench in a one-dimensional model with a discrete symmetry. In the last part of the paper we consider a class of systems which are being investigated in quantum optics, namely systems with one-dimensional scalar fields and a drive which is a combination of a scalar field and a vector field. We show that in such systems the dynamics after a slow or fast quench has different regimes, depending on the symmetry of the initial state."}
{"text":"\n\nThe Power of Choice in Network Growth\n\nWe consider the problem of finding a path between two nodes in a directed graph which is weighted by the choice of the nodes that are included in the path.

We show that the number of paths between two nodes is exponential in the number of edges incident to the source node. We consider the effect of allowing choice in the nodes included in the path on the problem of finding a minimum weight path between two nodes. We show that the number of minimum weight paths between two nodes is also exponential in the number of edges incident to the source node. We then consider the problem of finding a minimum weight path between two nodes which includes a given set of nodes. We show that this problem can be solved in polynomial time.

{"text":"\nEvolution favors protein mutational robustness in sufficiently large populations.\n\nEvolutionary theory predicts that proteins which are more tolerant to mutations will tend to evolve faster. We show that this prediction can be violated in small populations, where evolution is primarily neutral, if the mutations do not sufficiently increase the robustness of the protein. We find that in such cases the neutral evolution is slower than under the standard assumption of an infinitesimal mutational effect. We demonstrate this effect using an algorithm we developed to efficiently calculate the number of fitness-reducing mutations in a protein. We apply the algorithm to a large number of proteins from theRepresentatives of all three kingdoms of life, and find that the number of robust proteins is significantly smaller than the number of proteins that are robust under the standard assumption. Our results suggest that the size of the population may have a strong influence on the evolutionary dynamics of proteins, potentially affecting the rates of evolution and the outcome of the evolution."}
{"text":"\nWe have performed an systematic study of the effects of the Y\/Ba ratio on the superconducting properties of YBa_2Cu_3O_6+x by altering the Y\/Ba ratio in the melt growth process. We found that the critical current density (J_c) plateaus at around 60K for all the samples. The behavior of the in-plane resistivity (r_0) as a function of temperature also plateaus at around 60K. These results strongly suggest that the 60K plateau is a signature of the melting temperature of YBa_2Cu_3O_6+x. To further support this argument, we have compared the temperature dependence of J_c and r_0 for melt grown samples and the sintered samples. For the sintered samples, the J_c and r_0 increase steadily with decreasing temperature, which is consistent with the behavior expected for a normal conductor. However, for the melt grown samples, the J_c and r_0 increase at low temperature and then plateaus at around 60K, and then decrease with further decrease of temperature. The J_c-r_0 characteristics of the melt grown samples are consistent with the s-wave scattering model in which the s-wave scattering cross section increases at low temperature and then plateaus at around 60K and then decreases with further decrease of temperature. These results suggest that the low temperature properties of the melt grown samples are quite different from that of the sintered samples. We have also found that the melt grown samples have a much higher concentration of the CuO_2 phase than the sintered samples. These results suggest that the CuO_2 phase is not thermodynamically stable in the melt grown samples and the 60K plateau is a signature of the thermodynamic equilibrium between the YBa_2Cu_3O_6+x and CuO_2 phases."}

We show that in general there is anisotropic dispersion with a non-zero second-order coefficient, and that the density of states has a step-like profile with a gap around the resonance frequency. We analyze the effects of a large number of layers and of a small thickness of the individual layers on the transmission coefficient, and discuss the problem of selecting the optimal thickness of the individual layers in order to obtain a high transmission coefficient.

The remaining 29% of the progenitors are associated with unrenowned phenomena, possibly including tidal interactions, cosmic ray storms and\/or more exotic mechanisms such as the spindown of rotating axion halos.

{"text":"\n\nWe develop a scheme to calculate the excitation energy of an electron in a solid from its ground state, using the most recent version of the ab initio Effective Core Potentials (ECP) method. The method is based on the formalism of the projected Augmented wavefunction (PAW) and makes use of the Projected Range Superoperator (PRS) approach. The key idea is to generate a basis of optimized complex wavefunctions spanning the gap between the valence and conduction bands, and to express the excited state wavefunction as a linear combination of these basis functions. In this way the correlation effects in the band structure of the material are automatically included. The method is demonstrated for the calculation of the so-called *-band in materials with a large band gap, like ionic oxides. The results show that our method gives a very good description of the *-band, in good agreement with earlier calculations based on the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) approach. The method also has the advantage that it is fully scalable, in the sense that the inclusion of a larger basis of basis functions, i.e. a basis that contains more information, will improve the results. The PRS method can also be used to calculate the excitations of a more general multi-band system, and we discuss how the method can be generalized to deal with this case."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present photometric and spectroscopic observations of a sample of 21 intermediate-mass (2-8 M\u2299) AGB stars that are candidates for experiencing third dredge-up and hot-bottom burning (HBB) in their cores. Our aim is to estimate the relative abundances of the major chemical elements in these stars, as well as their nuclear evolution properties, from the observed abundances of iron and the r-process elements. We find that the iron abundances of our sample stars are well described by a linear relation in the same domain as those of the low-mass AGB stars. The r-process abundances are also well described by a linear relation, but the slope is different from the one for low-mass AGB stars. We also find that the r-process abundances are correlated with the iron abundances in a way that suggests the core helium abundance is lower in stars that experience more efficient r-process production. Our results therefore indicate that efficient HBB and third dredge-up are important for r-process production in intermediate-mass AGB stars. The large amount of r-process material in these stars may have important implications for the galactic chemical evolution and the origin of the r-process elements in the Galaxy."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate the possibility that the oscillations observed by the Kepler Mission are induced by the presence of giant planets in tight orbits around their host stars. We show that giant planets can excite large amplitudes in their host stars, provided that the stellar companions are not too massive and that they are in relatively tight orbits. We discuss the observational properties of these oscillations and their potential detectability with the Kepler data. We show that in massive binaries with separations smaller than about 0.5 the contribution to the power spectrum from orbital modulations can be stronger than the contribution from the ubiquitous solar-like oscillations, making the detection of a hidden giant companion possible. We also show that even in binaries with larger separations, the orbital modulation may produce detectable harmonic components in the power spectrum, provided that the giant companion is massive enough. We conclude that the detection of giant companions in tight orbits around solar-like stars is a viable prospect for the Kepler Mission, and that a detection would be an important milestone in extrasolar planet research."}

Scientists have been able to estimate the Yarkovsky effect for most NEAs. However, the thermal inertia of the surface of a large NEA can be very high, especially for those with a thick regolith layer, which makes the calculation of the Yarkovsky effect more uncertain. \n\nWe use a simple model to investigate the effects of thermal inertia on the Yarkovsky effect. We consider the case of an NEA with a regolith layer several meters thick. We find that the standard method used to estimate the Yarkovsky effect yields a larger value for an object with high thermal inertia than for one with low thermal inertia. We show that this is due to the standard method failing to take into account the cooling rate of the interior of the object. We correct this deficiency and show that the corrected Yarkovsky effect for an object with high thermal inertia is in fact smaller than for an object with low thermal inertia. We also investigate the effect of surface thermal inertia on the spin-up rate of an NEA, due to the Yarkovsky effect, and find that this is very small.\n\nWe conclude that the Yarkovsky effect is not likely to have a large effect on the orbits of large, high-thermal-inertia NEAs."}

{"text":"\nWe present a systematic study of the global disk oscillation modes in cataclysmic variables and other Newtonian accretors, such as young stellar objects and planetary systems, including our own. We show that these objects possess several low-frequency global modes that can be excited by a steady drive, provided that the drive frequency is close to the mode frequency. We analyze the conditions for the excitation of the modes and the associated instabilities. We derive a simple formula for the mode frequencies and show that these frequencies are not widely distributed, but rather they tend to cluster around a few values. We find that these clusters are related to the orbital frequencies of the system, and in particular to the ratio of the orbital frequencies of the two stars in a cataclysmic variable. We show that a mode that is excited by a drive with a frequency equal to the orbital frequency of the system will be very stable, because it will not be coupled to any of the other degrees of freedom of the system. We discuss the physical implications of our findings."}
{"text":"\n\nBlind Identification of Distributed Antenna Systems with Multiple Carrier Frequency Offsets\n\nWe consider the problem of blind identification of distributed antenna systems (DAS) in the presence of multiple carrier frequency offsets. A DAS is a network of spatially separated antenna nodes connected to a common source via a distribution network. The objective is to identify the number of nodes and the lengths of the cables connecting them to the source. We propose a general framework for blind identification of such systems based on measuring the inter-channel correlation at each node. We show that the proposed framework is applicable to a large class of DAS topologies and is resilient to the presence of additional branches that may be introduced to the system for the purpose of spoofing. We present an algorithm to compute the correlation in the presence of multiple carrier frequency offsets, and demonstrate that the proposed framework is able to uniquely identify the system configuration from a single correlation measurement under a wide range of parameter settings."}
{"text":"\nSecond-order perturbations of cosmological fluids: Relativistic effects\nof pressure, multi-component, curvature, and rotation\n\nWe consider second-order perturbations of cosmological fluids described by the perfect fluid\ncosmological model in a curved background spacetime. The model is exactly solved in a general\nmanner for a wide class of relevant physical situations. This includes fluids with an arbitrary number\nof components, fluids with pressure, and fluids in a general curved background spacetime with\nnon-zero Riemannian curvature, i.e. in a universe with a general curvature profile and with a\nnon-zero cosmological constant, as well as fluids in a rotating background. For the first time, a\n systematic analysis of the effect of the relevant physical parameters on the structure of the\nsecond-order spectrum is performed. We show that in a curved spacetime with a non-zero\ncosmological constant, second-order corrections can produce a new relativistic correction term\nthat depends on the Riemannian curvature of the background spacetime. We also show that fluids in\n rotating backgrounds exhibit a significant difference in the structure of their second-order spectrum\n when compared to their static counterparts. In particular, we find that the second-order\nperturbations of rotating fluids can become sexually symmetric, even if the underlying\nhydodynamics is symmetric under mirror reflection. The origin of this effect is a general\nrelativistic correction that arises when the velocity of the fluid becomes comparable to the speed\nof light. We analyze the effect of this correction on the structure of the second-order spectrum\n of fluids with an arbitrary number of components. In particular, we show that this correction\n can produce a significant slow-down of the evolution of the second-order perturbations.

{"text":"\nWe study the potential of Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) for highly turbulent solutions of the L fluid model (LANS-alpha) which was recently shown to possess intrinsic large-scale motions. The analysis is based on a recent derivation of the LES equations for the LANS-alpha model which takes into account the non-conservative terms in the original conservation laws. We show that the LES equations for LANS-alpha inherit the key properties of the LES equations for the classical Navier-Stokes equations. In particular, we show that (i) the new LES equations are unconditionally stable for all parameters in the range of validity of LANS-alpha, (ii) the energy transfer to the mean flow is controlled by a single parameter which is proportional to the square of the flow velocity, (iii) this energy transfer is very efficient in spite of the fact that the largest scales are not allowed to grow very fast, and (iv) the new LES equations are very similar to the LES equations for the Navier-Stokes equations.

{"text":"\nWe propose that massive Population III stars with weak magnetic fields can form through the magnetorotational collapse of a rotating cloud. We show that such a collapse can occur provided that the magnetic field is sufficiently diluted, the angular momentum is high enough, and the resistivity is low. The simplest case we consider is a uniform magnetic field along the rotation axis. In this case, the instability is triggered when the ratio of the resistivity to the angular momentum per unit mass, \u03c1\/L\u22c5kg\u20131, decreases below a critical value of \u03c1\/L\u22c5kg\u20131\u22483.3\u00d71020\u03a9m. We show that this condition can be satisfied if the magnetic field is sufficiently weak (B\u22725G) and the angular momentum is high (L\u2273107kg\u22c5m2), as can be the case in a collapsing rotating cloud. The critical resistivity for the instability to be triggered increases with the magnetic field and reaches \u03c1\u22485\u00d71020\u03a9m when B\u22485G. We also consider the more general case of a radially varying magnetic field, which is likely to be present in a collapsing cloud that formed through the accretion of rotating magnetized infalling material. We show that for a collapsing cloud to be stable against the magnetorotational instability, the radial profile of the resistivity has to satisfy \u03c1\u22655\u00d71020\u03a9m, with \u03c1 being the resistivity at the cloud's inner radius. We discuss the effect of the ionization fraction on the critical resistivity and find that a cloud can be stable against the magnetorotational instability even if the ionization fraction \u0393 is relatively high, provided that \u03c1\u2265\u0393\u22c5\u03c10, where \u03c10 is the resistivity of an uncharged gas and \u0393\u22c5\u03c10\u22481020\u03a9m.

{"text":"\n\nWe consider the problem of increasing network vulnerability to cascading failures. We first review several cascading failure phenomena that have been observed in practice, and for which an analytical understanding has been developed. We then present a general model of a network in which the vulnerability to failure is allowed to dynamically increase as a consequence of local failures. We show that the simplest such model, in which the vulnerability is increased according to a fixed rule, can explain several phenomena that have been observed in real-world networks, including the threshold of the fraction of nodes that needs to fail for the network to stop functioning. We also derive a simple formula for the average number of nodes that need to fail for the network to be rendered inoperable, which has practical applications in estimating the reliability of a network. We then consider the more general case of a network in which the vulnerability is increased dynamically, and we derive a condition that must be satisfied by the dynamics in order for the network to become more vulnerable to failure. We finally consider the problem of estimating the parameters of the dynamic rule by using measurements of the fraction of nodes that fail in response to an injected failure, and we show that this problem can be solved in a least-squares sense."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a detailed study of the line and continuum variability of two bright quasars, QB1 and QB2, at intermediate redshift (z ~ 1.1), selected from a sample of over 2000 quasars with available high-resolution echelle spectra. We find that both quasars exhibit extremely large (by an order of magnitude) continuum variability on timescales of weeks, which we attribute to the intrinsic variability of the accretion disc around the black hole. The observed continuum variability can be described using a simple model in which the accretion disc is treated as a uniform disk with an assumed turbulent velocity field, the solution of which gives a simple, power law continuum variability as a function of time. We show that this simple model can be used to reliably predict the continuum variability as a function of time for quasars with unknown continuum variability. In addition, we show that this model can be used to determine the size of the accretion disc, the duration of a typical accretion event, and the accretion rate of the quasar. We also find that both quasars exhibit non-negligible line variability, with the line-center optical depth varying by  \u223c 1.5%. We show this line variability is consistent with a model in which the line-forming region is treated as a cylindrical shell with an assumed velocity field, the solution of which gives a line variability that is in agreement with our observations. We conclude that this model can be used to describe the line variability of quasars with an unknown line variability, given knowledge of the continuum variability."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate the effect of a spin-zero particle-photon interaction on the polarization of light in external magnetic fields. We show that the spin-zero particle can be treated as a single photon with an effective mass, and the optical response can be obtained by using the effective photon theory. The exact solution of the effective photon theory is derived for the special case of a single-particle problem. The solution shows that the light polarization in the external magnetic field is altered by the spin-zero particle-photon interaction, and the change in the light polarization is dependent on the ratio of the effective photon momentum to the light momentum. The general solution of the effective photon theory for a multi-particle problem is obtained by using the formalism of the single-particle solution. The formalism of the general solution can be used to calculate the optical response of a spin-zero particle to an external magnetic field, and it can also be used to calculate the collective optical response of a collection of spin-zero particles to an external magnetic field. The results obtained in this paper can be used to study the light polarization in systems where the light is interacting with spin-zero particles in an external magnetic field, and the results can also be used to design optical devices that use the spin-zero particle-photon interaction to control the light polarization."}

These objects are relatively nearby (42-67 pc), young (7-10 Myr), and have a well-studied nearby molecular cloud. We present time series of photometric data for the low-mass stars GM1513 and GM1658 and the brown dwarf 2MASS J2126, and a single-aperture image of the brown dwarf 2MASS J Mottled photometric variations are caused by optically thick spots on the star's or brown dwarf's photosphere, with a size of roughly 50% of the radius for GM1513 and GM1658 and 30% of the radius for 2MASS J2126. The stars show a large range of accretion rates, from 10-4 to 10-0.4, and a large range of accretion variability, with accretion amplitude of roughly 1-6%. We estimate the accretion rate for 2MASS J2126 to be 10-0.4, close to the uncertain boundary between the accretion-driven and the drizzle-driven brown dwarf evolution. We find that accretion in these low-mass stars and brown dwarfs is likely driven by the same mechanism that drives accretion in young solar-type stars. We present a model in which accretion is driven by an instability in the boundary layer of the photosphere. We discuss this model in the context of other recent observations, and find that this model is consistent with a wide range of observations, including observations of young solar-type stars, older low-mass stars, and brown dwarfs."}

{"text":"\nWe study the spin-flip phenomenon in supermassive black hole (SMBH) binary mergers. We find that the frequency of the emitted gravitational waves (GWs) depends sensitively on the total orbital angular momentum (OAM) of the system, in addition to the relative spin of the SMBHs. More specifically, for a given SMBH- SMBH pair, as the total OAM increases, the frequency of the first GW peak increases, and then decreases, and then increases again, etc. We show that this kind of frequency variation is a generic feature of SMBH binary mergers, and is not due to the particular choice of the system's rest frame. By analyzing the spin-flip induced GWs, we are able to extract the individual spins of the SMBHs with high confidence, provided that the total OAM is large enough. As the total OAM decreases, the information about the individual SMBH spins becomes ambiguous. We analyze the low frequency GWs (small OAM) from the SMBH- SMBH mergers, and find that the inferred SMBH spin could be arbitrary, depending on the choice of the system's rest frame. Therefore, it is necessary to constrain the individual SMBH spin by combining the information from the low frequency GWs and the higher frequency GWs with large OAM. We show that the spin-flip phenomenon can be used to test the no-hair theorem in the limit of strong coupling."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a simple algorithm to generate integer solutions to the Fibonacci sequence that require only a bounded number of steps, on average. This is achieved by using the idea of insertion sorts. Our algorithm is based on a generalization of the binary search algorithm to fibonacci numbers. The analysis of the algorithm is based on a simple model which relates the number of steps to the number of bits of the largest number that is inserted. The model also predicts the number of steps required to generate a number which is twice the number of bits in the largest number. Our algorithm is efficient in the sense that the number of steps required is closely related to the number of bits in the largest number generated, and hence is sub-polynomial. We show that our algorithm is also robust by presenting an empirical analysis. The analysis shows that the number of steps required to generate a given number is almost the same for all starting values, and the number of steps required to double the number of bits in the largest number is also almost the same."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate the critical behavior of unitary random matrix ensembles in the thermodynamic limit. We show that the eigenvalues of these ensembles are Poisson distributed with the magnitude of the expected value equal to the thermodynamic equilibrium value of the root-mean-square (RMS) conductivity.

In the case of a model system with anharmonic interactions we show that the dynamic critical behavior is described by an anti-catastrophic type of criticality. In the case of a system with harmonic interactions we show that the critical behavior is described by a noisy catastrophe type of criticality. We also show that the evolution to a state with a large number of local maxima in the steady-state RMS conductivity is a slow process that can be described by a random walk.

{"text":"\n\nWe show that information-based asset pricing models can be derived from a general principle of combining risk and Knightian uncertainty in a sophisticated way. Our approach is based on a strict synthesis of the traditional capital asset pricing model and the probabilistic methodology of Von Mises.

In this case, we show that the resulting model can be used to price any kind of asset, including stocks, bonds, options, futures, etc. We also show that the same principle can be used to derive an information-based asset pricing model from the moment structure of the distribution of future cash flows, and that the resulting model can be arbitrage-free only if the distribution of future cash flows is not completely specified. In this case, the model can be used to price assets which are managed in a particular way, and may lead to the pricing of assets that have no future cash flows (such as currencies or commodities)."}
{"text":"\nWe consider the problem of characterizing the limiting behavior of a sequence of independent trials with successes and failures, when the probability of success converges to a limit value as the number of trials grows indefinitely large. We show that, under suitable assumptions, the limiting behavior is always described by a compound probability distribution, in which the probability of failure is given by a limiting distribution and the probability of success is given by a shifted and scaled version of the limiting distribution. This generalizes previous results in the literature which considered the special case of a random walk with probabilities of success and failure which are equal and constant. We also show that the limiting distribution has the Kolmogorov property if the original probability of success has this property. That is, the limiting distribution is equal to the limiting distribution of the sum of independent trials with the limiting distribution and with probability one-half."}
{"text":"\nWe consider a model with a spontaneously broken dilaton symmetry, which has been proposed as a possible solution to the Fifth Force problem.

We show that this model does not solve the Fifth Force problem, but rather generates a new and different problem which we call the \" dilaton problem\". The \" dilaton problem\" is that the addition of a kinetic term to the lagrangian which is invariant under a global U(1) symmetry transformation can result in a theory with non-zero vacuum expectation values for the U(1) gauge field and the matter field, even though the theory is symmetric under the U(1) group.

{"text":"\nWe consider a steady-state turbulent dynamo problem in a fluid with a low magnetic Prandtl number. The fluctuation dynamo mechanism is analysed by means of a Taylor-shell correlation technique. The three dimensionality of the problem is defeated by assuming that the velocity fluctuations are spatially uniform, and the effects of temporal variations are dismissed by averaging over one mean velocity cycle. The low magnetic Prandtl number is responsible for a fast secular increase of the magnetic field, which in the limit of a large number of Taylor shells describes an asymptotic dynamo. We show that this limit can be reached by a superposition of a small number of single shells, which constitute the building blocks of the dynamo. This reveals a direct link between the momentary fields of the single shells and the final asymptotic state. The influence of the mean velocity field is limited to the superposition of the single shells, and thus the correlation technique provides a rigorous way to separate the fluctuation and the mean field contributions to the dynamo. The single-shell analysis reveals a complex interplay between the different components of the velocity fluctuation, which are responsible for the induced magnetic field. In particular, we show that the fast increase of the magnetic field is due to a kinetic effect related to the circulation around the single shells. We discuss a possible generalisation of the correlation technique to more realistic three-dimensional problems."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate how the structure of interactions affects the dynamics of strategic behaviour in agent systems. We consider a simple model of autonomous agents interacting in a ring network, where the local rules of behaviour are inspired on the model of voter dynamics in political systems. We find that the system's dynamics is strongly affected by the agents' relative size, in a way that is consistent with the emergence of a \"power law\" distribution of the agents' effective strength. We show that the underlying mechanism is a feedback process whereby the agents' actions are correlated with their local success in the network. We find that the system becomes more robust to failures if the agents are allowed to differ in size, and we observe that the critical agent size for such a robust dynamics is a power law function of the network's size. Our results suggest that the dynamics of large-scale systems can be very sensitive to small details of their underlying interaction structure, and that power-law size distributions can be a robust outcome of simple feedback mechanisms in such systems."}

{"text":"\n\nA study of structural properties on profiles HMMs\n\nA profiler, which measures the execution time of a program, is one of the most effective tools for a software developer to optimize the performance of a program. One of the widely used profilers is the Profile-Guided Optimization (PGO), which is based on the use of execution time information collected from the instrumented program to guide the optimization process. The execution time information is usually collected as a stream of events and represented as a profile tree. The profile tree is a hierarchical structure, where each node is a function or an internal node that represents a function called by other functions. The function execution times are summarized as the leaf nodes of the profile tree. The execution times are usually collected as the program is executed multiple times, which results in a sequence of profile trees. The execution time of a function may vary between different runs of the program, due to the different initial values of the program, or due to the program execution stopping in the middle of a function. In order to obtain the execution time of a function in a single run of the program, the execution time at the leaf nodes of the profile tree is accumulated from the multiple runs of the program. This process is referred to as profile merging. The quality of the merged profile is highly dependent on the structure of the profile trees, specifically on the execution time distribution on the function calls in the profile trees. In this paper, we present a study of structural properties on profiles HMMs, which are used to model the structure of the profile trees. The proposed HMMs capture the conditional independence between functions in the profile trees. The HMMs are used to effectively merge multiple profiles and to guide the optimization process."}
{"text":"\nWe introduce a general framework for studying the self-consistency of hadron physics, which is based on the rigorous derivation of a set of consistency conditions from the governing equations of hadron dynamics. We apply this framework to the study of the hadronization of a hard probes, in the framework of the Hoefler-Waba-MacPherson (HWM) model, and show that the consistency conditions imply the exclusion of several physical quantities, which are nonetheless included in the standard hadronization model. In particular, we show that the HWM model is self-inconsistent in the case of large values of the hadronization parameter, $q$, which is equivalent to the statement that the standard hadronization model is inconsistent in this case. We show that the consistency conditions can be satisfied by Introducing a cutoff scale, $\\Delta$, in the HWM model, which results in a renormalization group transformation of the underlying effective action. The new effective action is given by a generalized HWM model, which we call the Hoefler-Waba-MacPherson-Cutoff (HWMC) model.

{"text":"\n\nWe have developed a new technique to measure the adhesion force between two similar materials, especially those with high resistivity, based on nano-triboelectrification. In our measurements, an AFM tip is first brought into contact with a specimen surface and then retracted. During this process, the AFM tip is charged by the frictional electrification, and then the charged AFM tip is brought into contact with a conductive electrode, resulting in a rapid increase in the current. We obtained a good correlation between the magnitude of this current and the adhesion force between the AFM tip and the specimen surface. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of various parameters, such as the cantilever spring constant and the tip shape, on the measurement. We also developed a new method to measure the work of adhesion between the AFM tip and the specimen surface, based on the integration of the AFM tip's displacement and the resulting electrostatic force. Finally, we discuss the application of this technique to the measurement of the adhesion force between a charged polymer and a neutral polymer."}
{"text":"\n\nWe give a detailed account of the structure of the character rings of the classical groups over fields which are neither algebraic nor topological in origin. The approach is via the study of certain ( raided ) functors which form a two - level structure on the category of finite - dimensional representations of the classical groups. We show that the source and the target of these functors are the hopf algebras and that they are related by the well - known equivalence of categories between the representations of the classical groups and the self - adjoint representations of the symmetric groups. The main tool is the use of the celebrated representation - theoretic fact that the character ring of a representation of a finite group G is isomorphic to the quotient ring of the algebra of G - invariant linear forms on the algebra of all linear forms on the underlying vector space. We show that, in the presence of an algebra isomorphism between the character rings of two representations, the original representations can be recovered from the character rings up to equivalence.

We find a very significant correlation ( Metallicities of dwarf galaxies in the Local Volume. We conclude that the Galactic winds have had a strong effect on the evolution of the metallicity of the DSGs in the Local Volume, and that this provides strong support for models in which the Galactic winds are an important regulator of the chemical evolution of the Galactic disc. We discuss our results in the context of the current theories of the formation and evolution of DSGs, and we highlight the need for a better understanding of the detailed physics of the Galactic winds in order to be able to produce more precise predictions for the effects of these winds on the chemical evolution of the Galactic disc."}
{"text":"\nEnhanced Half-Metallicity in Edge-Oxidized Zigzag Graphene Nanoribbons\n\nWe report a simple wet-chemical route to produce half-metallic zigzag graphene nanoribbons (ZGNRs) with different degrees of edge oxidation. The method involves the selective oxidation of disulfide groups on the ZGNRs' edges by chemical reduction in DMF\/MeOH solutions with potassium persulfate. The electronic and magnetic properties of the resulting ZGNRs are investigated using a combination of spectroscopy (EDX, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, UV\/Vis), thermodynamic (formation of the charge transfer complex with TCNQ), and transport (STM, CDW, and Hall effect) measurements. We show that the degree of edge oxidation can be tuned by varying the experimental conditions. When the degree of oxidation is sufficient to remove all the sulfur atoms from the ZGNRs' edges, the nanoribbons become fully metallic and display a behavior similar to that of a metal nanowire. By contrast, when the degree of oxidation is lower, the nanoribbons remain partially conducting, with their behavior ranging from that of a semiconductor to that of a semimetal, depending on the number of unoxidized disulfide groups on the nanoribbons' edges. Our results suggest that the electronic and magnetic properties of ZGNRs can be tuned over a very wide range by controlling the degree of edge oxidation, making them promising candidates for many applications, from electronics to spintronics."}
{"text":"\nWe comment on the statistical analysis in \"A new experimental limit for the stability of the electron\" by H.V. Klapdor-Kleingrothaus, I.V. Krivosheina and I.V. Titkova. We point out that the criterion of the stability of the electron proposed in this work is not equivalent to the usual definition of the electron stability. The authors introduce the additional condition that the energy of the electron should be minimal not only with respect to the entire potential energy surface, but also with respect to the space of the functions which are regular in the regions of the atomic nuclei and the electrons. As a result the usual definition of the electron stability is not satisfied and the obtained limit for the stability of the electron is larger than the corresponding limit obtained by using the usual definition. The work of the authors is an example of the application of the false logic in the statistical analysis. The obtained limit for the stability of the electron does not correspond to the physically possible values of the electron stability and has no physical meaning."}

{"text":"\n\nWe present here observations of dust and radio sources in quasars at redshifts up to 6.5. These quasars are extremely bright at millimeter and radio wavelengths, showing fluxes of $1-10^{41}$ Jy at $50-1000$ GHz. They are discovered by searching for point sources in observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background by the COBE\/FIRAS instrument, and subsequently confirmed as quasars by optical observations. We present here a statistical study of the millimeter and radio properties of these quasars, and discuss the implications of these results for the nature of the quasars, the intergalactic medium, and the properties of the Universe at very early times. In particular, we show that the observed correlation between the optical and radio luminosities of these quasars cannot be explained by anisotropic diffusion, and that it is inconsistent with a simple model in which the quasars are powered by a constant accretion rate onto a black hole. We suggest that this correlation may be explained by a model in which the quasars undergo \"bursts\" of accretion, and show that such a model is consistent with the observed correlation between the optical and radio luminosities if the accretion rate during the bursts is $\\sim 10^{41}$ M$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, with a duty cycle of order unity.

{"text":"\n\nWe report the observation of vortex formation by the merging and interference of multiple trapped Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) in a hybrid trap consisting of a ring trap and a cup-shaped trap. Two BECs, one in each trap, were prepared at different temperatures and then slowly merged. The interfering BECs were observed to form a vortex structure. The symmetry of the vortex structure was found to depend on the initial symmetry of the BECs. For example, the vortex formed from two BECs with a dumbbell-like structure was found to have a spoke-like structure, while the vortex formed from two BECs with a vortex-like structure was found to have a structure with two vortices superimposed on each other. We also found that the superposition of two BECs with a vortex-like structure can form a single vortex with a defect in the core. In addition, we observed the sudden change of the vortex structure when the two BECs with different structures were merged. The mechanism of the formation of the vortex by the merging and interference of multiple trapped BECs and the dependence of the vortex structure on the initial symmetry of the BECs are discussed."}
{"text":"\nWe study bound state calculations of the three-dimensional Yakubovsky equations with the inclusion of three-body forces. Performing a numerical solution we obtain the bound state structures and energies for a range of model potentials. We compare our results with other calculations, where the three-body forces are either neglected or included in a different way. We find that the effects of including three-body forces are rather small for reasonable values of the parameters in the model potentials. For some potentials, however, the inclusion of three-body forces results in larger bound state structures than in the case where they are neglected. This is particularly pronounced for a model potential which has a large quadrupole moment and for a model potential which is intended to describe a large molecular system. We also find that the inclusion of three-body forces has a small effect on the energy of the bound states. There are, however, two exceptions: for a model potential with a large dipole moment and for a model potential which describes a large molecular system, the inclusion of three-body forces results in a significant increase in the energy of the bound state. In the latter case this is due to the fact that the inclusion of three-body forces results in a significant increase in the rotational energy. We also discuss the difference between the results obtained with a parameter set which is intended to describe a large molecular system and a parameter set which is intended to describe a small molecular system."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a least-squares fit to the structural parameters of 35 globular clusters in M31, and a corresponding set of cluster selection criteria that result in a total of 21 \"fundamental\" clusters. The parameters are given in a set of equiprobably binned log-normal probability distributions, the parameters of which are obtained by a least-squares fit to the observed clusters. We find that the resulting fit has a high degree of precision, with a root-mean-square error of 0.071 mag in absolute magnitude, 0.aur in radius, and 5.4 kpc in distance. We have tested a variety of distance measures, and find that the choice of distance measure has only a minor effect on the shape of the fundamental plane. The selection criteria are such that the resulting fundamental plane has a nearly unbiased sample of clusters on it, and thus is well suited for further analysis and testing of globular cluster formation models. The clusters on the fundamental plane follow the predicted trend for increasing radii and absolute magnitudes (or optical depths) with cluster age, supporting the hypothesis of a universal relationship between these parameters. The clusters are well described by a log-normal distribution with a correlation coefficient of 0.81. We discuss a possible physical interpretation of the correlation, in terms of the distribution of mass within the clusters. We also find that the slope of the fundamental plane is different for clusters in M31 and in the Milky Way, which we attribute to the difference in the environments of the clusters in the two galaxies. We find no evidence for the presence of an accretion-driven conspiracy in M31, but do observe a small positive correlation between x-ray surface brightness and radius, which we attribute to the inflating nature of the clusters. The clusters on the fundamental plane show a wide range of orbital distributions, and the relationship between orbital distribution and cluster properties is discussed."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a new technique, hybrid differential stereoscopy, which combines phase retrieval and stereo image processing to extract spectral information from a single shot of diffraction patterns. The method is based on the hybrid input-output representation of diffraction, which combines the magnitude and the phase of the field in a single image. The sensitivity of the method is investigated by numerically solving the inverse scattering problem for a random-phase object in a two-dimensional binary mask, where the sensitivity is defined as the ratio of the spectral variance to the mean intensity variance in the recorded diffraction patterns. We show that the sensitivity depends sensitively on the distance between the mask and the object, and on the orientation of the mask with respect to the object. In particular, the sensitivity exhibits a strong peak whenever a one-dimensional spectrum is obtained, and a less strong peak whenever a two-dimensional spectrum is obtained. The theory is validated by numerical simulation and is applied to the problem of spectral imaging of a single shot of diffraction patterns."}

The geometric properties of such a flow are similar to those of a Fano flow. In particular,  we show that a certain class of nonsymmetric Fano flows is equivalent to a class of nonholonomic Ricci flows on certain kinds of symplectic manifolds.

We show that the nonholonomic Ricci flow is a solitonic flow, that is, it has a constant speed in a certain class of symplectic manifolds.

{"text":"\nWe consider the geometry of certain complex structures in D3-branes, which are non-trivial generalizations of Calabi-Yau or Anti-de Sitter 3-branes. These structures can be thought of as arising from creating an edge or a handle on a D3-brane. We show that, although the bulk geometry is not changed by these manipulations, the field theory on the boundary of the brane is dramatically altered. In particular, we show that these geometries are related to certain Limit Deformations of D3-branes which are known to have enormous practical importance in string theory. We show that the bulk geometry of these Limit Deformations is related to the bulk geometry of the original D3-branes in a natural way, and that the field theory on the boundary is related to the geometry of the original D3-brane in a rather more complicated fashion. In the case that the D3-brane is a Calabi-Yau brane, we show that the related Limit Deformation is a giant graviton with a (possibly complex) radius which is directly related to the (real) volume of the original Calabi-Yau brane. We also consider the case of an Anti-de Sitter brane, and show that the related Limit Deformation is a giant graviton with a real radius which is directly related to the (real) volume of the original Anti-de Sitter brane.

{"text":"\n\nWe present an analysis of the absorption lines in a sample of 19 gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) with the highest frequency of detected absorption lines, in order to place constraints on the nature of the progenitors. Our previous work, based on the analysis of a larger sample, suggested that the progenitors are likely to be post-asymptotic giant branch (post-AGB) stars. In this work we analyse the sample of 19 bursts with the highest frequency of absorption lines in more detail, in order to further constrain the nature of the progenitors. We find that the progenitors are likely to be post- LBV Wolf-Rayet stars. This is because the properties of the absorption lines are consistent with a low metallicity, low temperature atmosphere (which is characteristic of post-LBV WR stars), and because the relative probability of the different progenitor models producing the observed absorption lines is consistent with a post-LBV WR star. The only model which produces a significantly higher probability than a post-LBV WR star is a hot, massive ONeMg WD, but this model is not favoured by the observations. We also present an analysis of the optical afterglow emission from a sample of 26 bursts with detected absorption lines, in order to place further constraints on the nature of the progenitors. The afterglow emission is consistent with the burst having occurred within the wind of a post- LBV WR star, and this is the model which best explains the observations."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a study of star formation in low radio luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGN) from the SDSS. We find a strong correlation between radio and far-infrared luminosity, but no such correlation with optical or ultraviolet luminosity. We also find a correlation between radio and far-infrared luminosity and the star formation rate (SFR), but no such correlation for the optical\/ultraviolet SFR. These results suggest that the star formation in these galaxies is fueled by the AGN. We find a significant correlation between radio\/far-infrared and optical\/ultraviolet SFR for galaxies with known redshift, but no correlation for galaxies with unknown redshift. We find that the galaxies with known redshift tend to be at higher redshift. This could be because the correlation between radio\/far-infrared and optical\/ultraviolet SFR is a purely cosmic phenomenon, and the higher redshift galaxies are simply closer to this correlation. We present a simple model in which star formation in these galaxies is fueled by the AGN, and find that this model can explain the correlation between radio\/far-infrared and optical\/ultraviolet SFR for galaxies with known redshift. We discuss several other possible physical mechanisms that could explain the correlation between radio\/far-infrared and optical\/ultraviolet SFR for galaxies with unknown redshift."}

The survey covers an area of 3.4 steradians with 3, 70-arcmin diameter fields, selected to be free of dust and highly extinction, and to contain a high-redshift galaxy cluster in the background for purposes of distance calibration. The cluster is a member of the Great Attractor, at a distance of 200 Mpc, providing a highly reliable indicator of the distance to our galaxy. The cluster is also well-studied, providing an anchor for the distance measurement. The galaxies in the survey are extracted from the SDSS DR7, and the Cepheid variables are identified with the TYC catalogue. We find three candidate Cepheid variables in the first year of data. We discuss the quality of the candidates, and show that one of them is a known variable, and that the other two are likely to be variables, but that further observations are required to confirm this. We also show that there are a number of known variables in the survey area that were not extracted from SDSS DR7, providing a useful archive of variables for future studies."}
{"text":"\n\nWe study the formal properties of dimensional reduction schemes for generic covariance breaking actions.

(2) We prove a generalization of the\ufffd|-lemma to arbitrary dimensions, which implies that any scheme for dimensional reduction of generic covariance breaking must satisfy certain universal properties, which in particular imply the modularity of (1).

{"text":"\n\nWe present observations of X-ray emission from the planet pulsar B1257+12, obtained with the Chandra X-ray Observatory. We find that the planet, which is a giant gas giant in a close-in orbit around the pulsar, is not independently detectable as a point source in the X-ray data. We discuss this result in the context of our earlier observations of the planet's thermal emission in the infrared, and in the context of theoretical models for the planet's atmosphere. We find that in the most optimistic case the planet's atmosphere would produce an X-ray flux only 1% of the detected X-ray flux from the star. In the case of a radiative atmosphere with a temperature of 1000 K, the planet's atmosphere would produce an X-ray flux 10% of the detected X-ray flux from the star. We discuss this in the context of a model in which the planet's atmosphere is clouds of diamonds. In that model, the highest density of diamonds would be at the inner edge of the planet's atmosphere, and the temperature would be too low to produce an X-ray flux large enough to be detected. We find that in this case the average density of the atmosphere would have to be 2.2 kg m-3 in order to explain the observed mass of the planet, and the thickness of the atmosphere would have to be 3.5 kpc. We discuss this in the context of the implications for detecting atmospheres around giant gas giants around low mass stars, and for the possibility of detecting X-ray emission from giant gas giants around more massive stars. We also discuss this in the context of the implications for the definition of the term \"planet.\""}

{"text":"\nWe continue our study of the relativistic muon decay and the type of neutrino emitted. The new parameterization for the decay branching ratio and the mean proper lifetime is derived. As an application, we show that our parameterization reduces to the conventional parameterization in the limit where the neutrino's velocity is much smaller than the speed of light. In the framework of our parameterization, the predictions of different theories on the type of neutrino emitted in the muon decay are compared. Our parameterization predicts that the neutrino emitted in the muon decay is a nearly flavor- symmetric, small-scale distorted state with a flavor-oscillating lifetime of (4.7-4.9) ns. This prediction is consistent with the idea that the neutrino emitted in the muon decay is a highly non-relativistic flavor-symmetric state with a flavor-oscillating lifetime.

The observations were performed in parallel with the millimeter continuum emission observations presented in Paper II of this series, and cover the same molecular cores. We find nine ammonia masers in six of the cores observed, and a non-detections of ammonia in the other cores. The maser detections are in line with the masers reported by Baba et al. (1995), and are generally located at the positions of the thermal ammonia masers reported by multiple authors. We find that the ammonia masers in some cores (e.g. 30 GHz-DC and DC3) are wider than the thermal ammonia line, which could indicate the presence of an avoided crossing between the maser and the thermal molecular line. The maser non-detections in the other cores (e.g. VLA-1, HE85, and 57North) could be due to (i) absence of ammonia, (ii) insufficient sensitivity, or (iii) maser properties not suitable for detection with the Odin observations. We also report non-detections of methanol masers in the same cores, despite the fact that the sensitivity is similar to, or better than, that of previous observations with the same receiver and horn.

We have also derived the mean surface brightness of the ETGs in the host galaxies, and found that it is 2.5 mag fainter than the global galaxy surface brightness. This result implies that the accretion energy is distributed isotropically within the ETG, except for the central region where the accretion energy is dumped by the AGN.

{"text":"\n\nWe have performed a systematic angle-resolved photoemission study of the three-dimensional (3D) superconductor YBa_2Cu_3O_(7-delta). The 3D structure has long been believed to be a possible realization of the strongly correlated colloid model, in which the different orbitals of the 3d1-wavefunctions are spatially separated and the superconducting order is attributed to the formation of a lattice of Cooper pairs along the a- and b-axes with a gap along the c-axis. Our results show, however, that in the superconducting state the 3d1-wavefunctions are strongly hybridized and that the structure is better described by a model in which the superconducting order is mediated by a singly-degenerate orbital that is common to all the units of the 3D structure. We have also found that the system undergoes a structural phase transition at a temperature of about 30 K, which may be related to the mechanism of superconductivity.

We found that the distribution of CG dinucleotides along the genome follows a universal spectrum, characterized by a parameter a, which may be close to a value of 1.

The variability of the growth rate of cells is a relevant topic because it affects many different processes, such as the synchronization of cell populations and the detection of small subpopulations of cells with different features. We applied our new method to the study of the growth variability of a large panel of cell clones derived from the same tumour, to assess whether the growth variability of these clones could be related to their genetic instability. We show that the growth variability is related to the genetic instability of the clones, as measured by the frequency of micronucleated cells and the number of chromosomal aberrations, and that it can be used as a simple and rapid predictor of the genetic instability of a given clone."}
{"text":"\n\nXMMU J174716.1-281048: a \"quasi-persistent\" very faint X-ray transient?\n\nWe present observations of a previously unknown transient source, discovered in April 2008 in the XMM-Newton][1] Guest Observer Program. The source, XMMU J174716.1-281048, is a bright hard transient in the soft state, with a transient intraday flux range of order of magnitude in the hard band, and a rise time of several tens of minutes. We find that the observed phenomenology is consistent with a \"quasi-persistent\" transient with a \"comfortably\" stable accretion phase, possibly modulated by episodic or highly structured accretion, with a correspondingly low duty cycle. The observed phenomenology does not allow a clear determination of the accretion phase geometry, but we suggest that a relatively long accretion channel with manyClassicalDarkFlares[2] and a high accretion efficiency (indicated by the observed rapid rise times) is a likely explanation for the observed phenomenology. The relatively long lifetime of the transient (in excess of 1 kyr) may be explained by a very low accretion rate and a correspondingly low duty cycle, with a correspondingly low mass accretion rate, or by a large dilution factor due to a large accretion column. Alternatively, the source may be a member of the new class of HighMassX-rayBinaries[3] with accretion columns that are not optically thick, and with a correspondingly high accretion efficiency. We find that the observed properties of XMMU J174716.1-281048 are consistent with those expected from a member of the class of HighMassX-rayBinaries with an optically thin accretion column and with a low duty cycle, and that the transient has a relatively long lifetime. We discuss the implications of this finding for the role of accretion in the evolution of HighMassX-rayBinaries."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a study of the colour selection of distant galaxies in the UKIDSS Ultra-Deep Survey. We find that the colour selection is peaked at GAL99 centre and it is slightly blue away from the centre. This is different from the colour selection in the SDSS survey where the colour selection is more red in the centres of the fields. The difference in the colour selection is probably due to the different survey geometry. The centre of GAL99 is filled with many bright galaxies and the outskirts are dominated by faint galaxies. The colour selection is obtained from the 2-colour distribution of galaxies with respect to their local galaxy number density. The colour selection is independent of the absolute magnitude and redshift. The 2-colour distribution of galaxies in GAL99 is very different from that in the SDSS, with the main difference being that the SDSS colour selection is more red in the centres of the fields, while in GAL99 the colour selection is blue in the centres. We have compared the GAL99 colour selection with the SDSS colour selection using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, and found that the two colour selections are statistically different. This suggests that the colour selection in GAL99 is not the same as the SDSS colour selection. We have also compared the GAL99 colour selection with the SDSS colour selection using the same Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, and found that the two colour selections are statistically different. This suggests that the colour selection in GAL99 is not the same as the SDSS colour selection."}
{"text":"\nWe present here results of a systematic study of the B-band attenuation of the light from all galaxies in the Millennium Galaxy Catalogue with photometric redshifts in the range 0.155 < z_phot < 1.0. For each galaxy we have derived a bolshoi model fit to the observed B-band attenuation, expressed in terms of the dust and stellar mass density distributions. We have found that the stellar mass density does not correlate with the B-band attenuation for disc galaxies, but it does so for bulge galaxies, with a correlation coefficient of R = 0.48 (4.7sigma). The dust mass density, on the other hand, correlates with the B-band attenuation for both disc and bulge galaxies, with correlation coefficients of R = 0.81 (3.7sigma) and R = 0.69 (3.7sigma) respectively. We have used the correlation between the dust mass density and the B-band attenuation to derive the dust mass density of the catalogue galaxies, and we find that it is 5.1 kMpc-3 (1.6sigma) for disc galaxies and 7.9 kMpc-3 (1.7sigma) for bulge galaxies. We discuss the implications of our findings for the future analysis of galaxy catalogues in the framework of galaxy scaling relations."}
{"text":"\nWe consider a force-free magnetosphere of an aligned rotator in the split-monopole approximation. We obtain two classes of analytical solutions in the presence of a pure differential rotation, and determine the boundary conditions at the magnetopause for these solutions. The first class of solutions is valid in the absence of a tilt of the rotational axis, and the second class is valid in the presence of a non-zero tilt angle. The solutions have different structures, and the boundary conditions are different for the two classes. We discuss the differences between the two sets of solutions, and the factors which determine the structure of the solutions. We also determine the electromagnetic energy flux from the magnetosphere into the internal field, and the energy flow due to the differential rotation. We show that a non-zero tilt angle results in an energy flux from the magnetosphere into the internal field, and the energy flow is in general not parallel to the differential rotation. We also discuss the implications of the energy flow for the structure of the magnetosphere, and the relative importance of the energy flux and the energy flow for the total energy transport in the system."}
{"text":"\nWe present a study of the physical properties and evolution of high redshift galactic winds, based on a systematic analysis of the galaxy-wind absorption features in a sample of 26 galaxies at redshifts higher than 6. We derive a set of relationships between the absorption features and the physical properties of the galaxies, which can be used to infer the physical parameters of winds in galaxies at any redshift. Our main results are as follows. (1) The strength of the absorption feature is proportional to the mass of the wind, but is inversely proportional to the density of the wind and the optical depth of the gas through which the wind is passing. (2) The absorption feature is blueshifted with respect to the systemic velocity of the galaxy, and the amount of blueshift is inversely proportional to the density of the wind. (3) The absorption feature is broadened as the wind is increasingly collisional, and the degree of broadening is inversely proportional to the dynamic pressure of the wind. (4) The absorption features show a positive correlation with the star formation rate and a negative correlation with the gas fraction in the galaxy. (5) The absorption features tend to be more prominent in galaxies that are more distant from the center of the galaxy, in galaxies with low metallicity, and in galaxies with high gas fractions. Our results suggest that winds in galaxies at high redshift are, on average, less massive, less dense, longer, and more collisional than winds in galaxies at low redshift.\n\nWe have presented a set of relationships between the physical properties of high redshift galactic winds and the absorption features of those winds.

{"text":"\nA simultaneous center-of-mass correction of nucleon density and momentum\n  distributions in nuclei\n\nWe have performed a three-dimensional (3D) microscopic analysis of the structure of nuclei, using the 3D version of the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) theory. We have found a new structure parameter, the center-of-mass (COM) density distribution, which is different from the usual nuclear density distribution. We have also found a new momentum distribution, which we call the COM momentum distribution, as a function of the distance from the center of mass. Our results show that these two distributions are related to the deformation of the 3D structure of nuclei, and in particular to the anisotropic distribution of nucleons in the presence of the restoring force due to the momentum conservation. We have derived a simple formula for the correction to the density distribution, and to the momentum distribution as a function of the distance from the center of mass, in terms of the two new structure parameters. The predicted corrections agree with the results of our 3D microscopic analysis, and with the results of a 2D microscopic analysis based on the structure optimization method. Our results also suggest a simple formula for the COM density distribution in terms of the two-particle correlation functions."}
{"text":"\nWe study (2+1)-Einstein spacetimes of finite type, that is, spacetimes in which the Riemannian metric is a function of the two-dimensional Riemannian manifold (2+1)-spacetime and a finite parameter. We show that such (2+1)-Einstein spacetime necessarily has a certain symmetry, and we use this symmetry to reduce the study of such (2+1)-Einstein spacetimes to the study of a certain class of (2+1)-symmetric Riemannian manifolds, which we term symmetric (2+1)-Riemannian manifolds. We show that this class has a natural description as the (2+1)-dimensional quotient of a (3+1)-dimensional Lorentzian manifold, and we show that it is closed under the standard operations of Riemannian manifold theory, that is, the operations of restriction to a submanifold, direct and inverse images under a mapping, and tensor and wedge products. We use this closure to show that any (2+1)-Einstein spacetime of finite type is isometric to a symmetric (2+1)-Riemannian manifold, up to a positive constant factor which can be chosen to make the (2+1)-Einstein spacetime unitarily symmetric. We show further that any symmetric (2+1)-Riemannian manifold can be obtained in this way from a (3+1)-Lorentzian manifold, up to a positive constant factor which can be chosen to make the symmetric (2+1)-Riemannian manifold unitarily symmetric. We show further that the group of invertible (2+1)-Riemannian metrics on a symmetric (2+1)-Riemannian manifold has a natural description as a subgroup of the group of invertible (3+1)-Riemannian metrics on the (3+1)-Lorentzian manifold from which the symmetric (2+1)-Riemannian manifold is obtained. We show further that the group of symmetric (2+1)-Riemannian manifolds is closed under the quotient operation, that is, the operation of taking the quotient of a symmetric (2+1)-Riemannian manifold by a subgroup, and we use this fact to obtain a description of quotient symmetric (2+1)-Riemannian manifolds in terms of symmetric (2+1)-Riemannian manifolds."}
{"text":"\nWe propose and investigate theoretically the concept of photonic molecules made of matched and mismatched microcavities. Such structures can be used to design new functionalities in microlasers and optoelectronic components, which are based on the collective dynamics of cavity photons. Our main results are as follows. First, we show that in a system composed of two matched microcavities, one can achieve laser action, while the emission spectrum is sensitive to the drive frequency. This is different from the conventional lasing, where the emission spectrum is very stable against frequency changes. Second, we find that in a system composed of two mismatched microcavities, one can achieve laser action, while the emission spectrum is independent of the drive frequency. This is different from the conventional lasing, where the emission spectrum is very sensitive to frequency changes. Third, we show that in a system composed of three microcavities, one can achieve laser action, while the emission spectrum is sensitive to the drive frequency and can be easily controlled by an external cavity. Finally, we investigate theoretically the optical properties of a system composed of two microcavities, which are coupled through a fiber. We show that such a system is capable of producing laser light, while the emission spectrum is sensitive to the drive frequency and can be easily controlled by an external cavity."}
{"text":"\nWe present the first study of the static potential created by a gluon-quark-antiquark combination in lattice QCD. The potential is evaluated exactly at leading order in the perturbative expansion, and it is shown that the gluon contribution is always negative, in qualitative agreement with the predictions of the quark-antiquark theory. The quark-antiquark potential is also evaluated exactly and shown to have the correct sign, in qualitative agreement with the prediction of the quark-quark theory. We find that the antiquark contribution to the static potential is always positive, except for the case with a color-flavor-locked (CFL) antiquark, which can be either positive or negative. The largest absolute value of the antiquark contribution is found to be slightly larger than the absolute value of the quark contribution. This is consistent with the quark-antiquark theory, while the quark-quark theory would predict that the absolute value of the quark contribution is always larger. We also find a strong quark-antiquark symmetry in the static potential, in agreement with the quark-antiquark theory. In addition, we evaluate the static potential with the antiquarks instantaneously generated at the lattice site, in the approximation where the antiquarks are not allowed to move away from the lattice site. We find that the antiquark contribution can be either positive or negative, depending on the flavor of the antiquark. The absolute value of the antiquark contribution is found to be always smaller than the absolute value of the quark contribution, consistent with the quark-quark theory. We also find a strong quark-antiquark symmetry in the static potential, in agreement with the quark-antiquark theory. Our results suggest that the quark-antiquark theory may be a good description of the quark-antiquark structure in the lattice QCD."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate the structure of accretion disks in Schwarzschild and Kerr geometries, by developing two sets of fitting formulae for the solutions of the governing equations. The first set is based on the assumption that the inner disk is illuminated by a uniform radiation flux, while the second set includes a non-uniform flux distribution, which can be used to model the effects of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) on the accretion disk. In the first set of formulae, the outer disk is described by the solution of the stationary Navier-Stokes equation, in the absence of a gravity field, and the inner disk is described by the solution of the stationary Einstein equations, in the presence of a Schwarzschild-like gravity field. In the second set of formulae, the outer disk is described by the solution of the stationary Navier-Stokes equation, in the absence of a gravity field, and the inner disk is described by the solution of the stationary Einstein equations, in the presence of a Kerr-like gravity field. The fitting formulae are given in a parameter-free form and can be used to derive the evolution of the structure of the disk, as a function of the radial coordinate, for both steady and unsteady flows. Finally, we discuss the physical implications of our results."}
{"text":"\n\nCharacterization of Instrumental Phase Stability\nThe motivation for this work is the need for high-throughput techniques for measuring the instrumental phase stability of fiber-based components. The goal is to develop an approach that does not require the use of a reference during the measurement. The proposed approach combines the advantages of two different techniques: the transmission-based technique of dual-wave mixing and the reflection-based technique of spectral interferometry. The key idea is to use the spectral interferometry technique to measure the phase contribution of a single-mode fiber and the dual-wave mixing technique to simultaneously measure the phase contribution of a multi-mode fiber. The combination of these two measurements allows us to isolate the instrumental phase contribution. The proposed approach was tested on a simple fiber-based Mach-Zehnder interferometer. The results obtained show that the instrumental phase stability can be characterized with a high degree of confidence using only the proposed approach, without the need for a reference."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a comparative study of the silicon monoxide (SiO) and water (H2O) maser lines in the protoplanetary nebula OH 231.8+4. We have observed with millimeter\/submillimeter resolution, using the SCUBA camera on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope, a region of the OH 231.8+4 protoplanetary nebula that contains an arc-shaped ionization region. The ionization region contains a small fraction of the total ionized gas in the nebula and is optically thick to both H2O and SiO maser lines. We find that the H2O maser line is brighter in the ionization region than in the non-ionized gas. The SiO maser line is optically thick in the ionization region, and we do not detect a contribution from the ionized gas. These results suggest that the ionized gas has a lower density of silicon monoxide than the non-ionized gas. This is consistent with the chemical model in which the ionized gas consists primarily of hydrogen, helium, and carbon, and the non-ionized gas contains a significant fraction of silicon monoxide."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider the computational complexity of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for large-scale statistical learning problems. In particular, we focus on the setting of sparse graphical models, where the number of parameters to be estimated is much larger than the sample size. We show that a standard MCMC estimator for the parameters of a sparse graphical model is competitive with regard to the minimal expected sampling cost under the assumption that the observations are independent and identically distributed. In other words, we show that, despite the large number of parameters, the sampling complexity is almost the same as for a problem with one parameter. The key ingredient is a connection between the error of the estimator and the conditioning of the Markov chain. As an application, we consider the problem of estimating the parameters of a mixture of distributions, which is known to be non-linear in the parameters. We show that this problem can be simplified by regarding the parameters of the mixture as a single parameter, which can be estimated by a single MCMC step. As a by-product, this result implies that the smallest expected sampling cost for the problem is proportional to the number of parameters, independent of the sample size."}
{"text":"\n\nDust far-infrared emission contains information about the temperature, composition, and size distribution of grains. We present a statistical analysis of far-infrared photometry of eight Pluto-bound comets and 26icy bodies in the Kuiper belt, obtained with the Herschel space telescope. We find that the far-infrared colors are well described by a power law with a linear relationship between the dust temperature and the effective particle size. We use this relation to derive the dust temperature and the size distribution for each object. We find that the dust temperature increases with heliocentric distance for Kuiper belt objects, in agreement with recent theoretical models. The derived size distributions are described by a power law with a linear relationship between the power law index and the heliocentric distance. This suggests that the size distribution does not change significantly with heliocentric distance. We discuss our results in the framework of current models for the formation and evolution of Kuiper belt objects."}
{"text":"\n\nUnravelling the morphologies of Luminous Compact Galaxies using the HST\/ACS GOODS survey\n\nWe present a statistical analysis of the morphologies and photometric properties of a sample of 25 Luminous Compact Galaxies (LCGs) selected from the HST\/ACS GOODS survey. We use the+\/ - aperture photometry and the two-band colour information from the survey to determine the photometric parameters of our sample, and to probe the nature of the observed morphologies. We find that the LCGs in our sample are log(M\/Mpc2) 10.5 +\/- 1.4, which is consistent with the notion that LCGs are the most compact galactic objects in the Universe. We show that a simple model in which the observed photometric properties are related to the underlying stellar mass, via a power-law scale length, can quantitatively reproduce the observed morphology distribution, without the need to invoke specific physical mechanisms such as the bars and slingshot from the centre. We also show that the observed distribution of colour excesses can be reproduced by a simple model in which the colour excess is related to the local surface or volume density, and is not related to the overall shape of the galaxy. We discuss our results in the context of the current theory of LCG formation, and identify the regions of agreement and disagreement between the predictions of theory and the results of our analysis."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a catalog of 1251 Spitzer line luminosities of specially selected supernova (SN) remnants in the Local Volume. These data are combined with 42 selected SN remnants in a separate catalog with published Spitzer line luminosities, for a total of 1393 SN remnants. We use principal component analysis (PCA) to explore the linearly dependent structure in the Spitzer line luminosity data. We find a clear correlation of the SN remnant Luminosity (L_Spitzer) with the 3.5 kpc ish radius, R_(3.5), but not with the 6 kpc ish radius, R_(6). The Spitzer line luminosity is not correlated with the age of the remnant, except possibly for the oldest remnants ( >> 5 kyr). The size and the age of a SN remnant are correlated, in that larger remnants are generally older. The Spitzer line luminosity is linearly dependent on the metallicity (Z_Fe) of the SN remnant, but not on the distance to the SN remnant. This is consistent with the known correlation of the Spitzer line luminosity with the age of the remnant, since the metallicity of the remnant is roughly constant with age. We discuss these results in the context of models for SN remnant evolution."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a systematic investigation of the cooling of metals and molecules in simulations of structure formation. We find that the cooling rate has a strong influence on the resulting structures, and that the cooling rate is very sensitive to the number and placement of the initial seeds.

We find that the distribution of cooling rates is well described by a power law, and we show that this power law is consistent with a simple model in which the cooling rate is proportional to the volume of the smallest connected component of the system. We present a simple explanation for the different cooling rates observed for metals and molecules, and we show that the distribution of cooling rates can be used to distinguish between different mechanisms of structure formation."}
{"text":"\n\nWe describe results of a program to calibrate the GLAST Burst Monitor (GBM) detectors. The GBM detectors comprise a ring of 24 parallel-connected Cadmium-Zinc-Telluride (CZT) detectors surrounding the GLAST gamma-ray detectors.

The GBM detectors are used to identify cosmic-ray bursts and to measure the total rate of cosmic rays in the energy range above 100 keV. We describe methods to reduce the time to detect a burst from several seconds to a few milliseconds, to improve the ability to detect bursts that occur close to the time that a gamma-ray burst triggers the GLAST detectors. We also describe methods to improve the spatial resolution of the GBM detectors, by combining the signals from the individual CZT detectors in a way that reduces both the noise and the spatial sensitivity to single-pixel failures. We present measured spatial and temporal responses of the GBM detectors, and we discuss how the responses depend on the selected combination of signals from the individual CZT detectors."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present new visible and near-infrared photometry of the Uranian irregular satellites Sycorax, Prospero, Stephano, Setebos and Trinculo, obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope. We show that the satellites exhibit considerable colour diversity, particularly in the range 0.8\u20131.5 \u03bcm. Prospero and Stephano are relatively red, while Sycorax, Setebos and Trinculo are much bluer. The colours are stable with time, within the 1% level, except for Stephano, whose colour has changed by ~75% since 1999. We discuss the origin of the colour diversity in terms of different degrees of spacecraft contamination and photodegradation of the polymers and other materials composing the surfaces of the satellites. We estimate the size of the satellites by comparison with the radii of dust particles in the environment, and find that all of the irregulars are larger than 5 km in diameter, except for Setebos.

{"text":"\n\nWe present an analysis of the selection effects that may have influenced the redshift distributions of Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) observed with the Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) on board the Swift satellite. We show that selection effects cannot explain the correlation between the redshift distribution of BAT-observed bursts and that of the Hosta service, which relies on detections by the optical telescopes of the Robonet collaboration. We find that this correlation can be explained by the presence of an underlying power law distribution with a power law index of 1.92 \u00b1 0.01 (hosta) and 1.94 \u00b1 0.01 (BAT), the latter showing a significant linear correlation with the hosta index (r = 0.81, p < 0.001). We conclude that the origin of this correlation is the presence of a burst population with a redshift distribution that follows a power law with a steeper index than the bursts observed by BAT. We show that this burst population has a probability distribution function that is consistent with the observed correlation, and we conclude that this population is responsible for the correlation between the hosta and BAT redshift distributions. We discuss the physical origin of this burst population and find that only a small fraction of the models we consider can reproduce the correlation."}
{"text":"\n\nComptonization and the Spectra of Accretion-Powered X-ray Pulsars\n\nWe present a study of the impact of Comptonization on the observed spectra of accretion-powered X-ray pulsars. Using a newly developed grid-based approach, we evaluate the effect of temperature, density, and turbulence on the spectra of these objects in a manner that is both statistically robust and computationally efficient.

{"text":"\n\nWe present the absolute calibration of the Spitzer multiband imaging photometer for the 70 micron band, as well as an analysis of the instrument's performance. We determine the absolute calibration by measuring the 70 micron emission from a Type II radio source with well-known absolute flux densities at eight different Spitzer observing altitudes. We find that the absolute calibration is accurate to better than 2% in flux density and 5sigma in position, meeting the requirements of the Spitzer Science Center's Guide to Proposal Writing for Observations with Spitzer. We assess the instrument's performance by comparing the results of a large set of observations of Mars, made in June 2003 during Spitzer's Cooled Mid-Infrared Thermal Imaging Spectrometer (COMIS) cryogenic instrument testing, with the results of the same observations made with the Multiband Imaging Photometer for Spitzer (MIP) at room temperature in August 2003. We find that the COMIS and MIP data sets are consistent with each other, and that the MIP data set is in good agreement with the previous room-temperature MIP Mars data set, with a global average radiance of 67.3 Jy\/Be with a standard deviation of 0.7 Jy\/Be. We also find that the relative radiance of the dust halo around Mars, as measured by MIP, is consistent with the radiance of the halo observed with the Mars Express orbiter's Visual and Infrared Thermal Imaging Spectrometer (VIRTIS), with a correlation coefficient of 0.93. We discuss these results in the context of the current theories of the formation and evolution of the Martian surface and atmosphere, and of the planet's climate history."}
{"text":"\nBoolean network model predicts cell cycle sequence of fission yeast.\nWe have developed a Boolean network model to describe the cell cycle of fission yeast. Our model accounts for the sequential appearance of the cell-cycle-regulatory proteins Cdt1, Geminin, Cdk1, and cyclin B as well as for the cell-cycle-regulatory events upon entrance into and exit from meiosis. In addition, our model can describe the influence of the protein Cdt2 on the cell cycle, as well as the effects of various environmental stresses such as starvation and DNA damage. We used a machine-learning approach to determine the optimal number of states in the Boolean network as well as the optimal connections between the states. Our model has a small number of parameters and can describe well the behavior of the cell cycle in wild-type cells as well as in cells in which key cell-cycle-regulatory genes are overexpressed or deleted. Furthermore, our model can describe well the cell-cycle-regulatory events that arise in meiosis. Our results suggest that the cell cycle of fission yeast is controlled by a small number of proteins that are connected in a complex Boolean network."}
{"text":"\n\nWe have performed first-principles-based molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of non-reacting oxygen adsorbed on a bare Al(111) surface, in order to investigate the effect of non-adiabatic effects on the dissociation of oxygen molecules. We find that the fraction of dissociated oxygen molecules increases with increasing the temperature, and that the average number of AlO, AlO, and O atoms per cell is around 3, 2, and 2, respectively, at the temperature of 100 K. The MD results show that the non-adiabatic effects can induce an effective magnetic field in the Al layer, which increases with the temperature. The maximum value of the effective magnetic field is around 1 T at the temperature of 600 K. We also found that the oxygen molecules are sensitive to the non-adiabatic effects in a temperature range between 100 and 600 K, and the oxygen molecule can be completely dissociated in this temperature range. The non-adiabatic effects can also significantly increase the reaction rate constant of the dissociation reaction of oxygen molecules. Our findings suggest that the non-adiabatic effects can be used to design a new route for the dissociation of small molecules at metal surfaces."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present photometric data from the MOST satellite, which was used to measure the differential rotation of Kappa1 Ceti in the period from 2008 July to 2009 January. We find that the rotation period of the star's visible disk is 4.34 \u00b1 0.01 min longer than that of the star's chromosphere, which we measure for the first time. We show this result is consistent with the disk and star having different masses, with the star having a mass 1.6 \u00b1 0.2 M\u2299 and the disk having a mass 0.55 \u00b1 0.05 M\u2299. We estimate the length of the star's rotation period to be 51.2 \u00b1 1.0 min. Therefore, if the star and disk are not being tidally locked, the disk must be rotating counter to the star's spin, at a ratio of 3:2. This is the first time such a precise measurement has been made of the differential rotation of a giant exoplanet. Differential rotation can have a significant effect on the evolution of a giant exoplanet, and so this measurement is important for understanding the interior structure and evolution of exoplanets."}
{"text":"\nWe study the production of vector mesons at hadron colliders within the framework of the effective Lagrangian approach. We consider the leading pion pion scattering contribution as well as the secondary vector meson production and the inclusive direct production. In all cases the contribution of a top-quark initiated process is calculated and compared to the Standard Model prediction. We find a significant deviation from the Standard Model which can be described by an additional vector meson coupling to the top-quark. In our scenario the new vector meson coupling is generated through the spontaneous symmetry breaking of a larger group which includes the top-quark and the new vector meson. This scenario is in agreement with the general prediction that new physics can be expected at high energies or large momenta. The parameters of the new vector meson coupling can be constrained by the available data. We discuss the possibility that the new vector meson coupling is related to the non-renormalizable dynamics of the strong interaction."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present an analysis of the Tully-Fisher relation for 77 nearby galaxies using the latest Hipparchus catalogue of galaxy photometry. We find that the scatter in the Tully-Fisher relation is significantly larger than previously found, and that the relation has a distinctive 'bulge' at high optical depths. We show this is most likely due to an incorrectly assumed value for the galaxy surface brightness, and that when the relation is corrected for surface brightness effects it reverts to the form found in previous studies. We derive an expression for the rotational width in terms of the galaxy stellar mass, radius, and surface brightness. The new expression is consistent with the earlier result, but in addition is able to explain the observations without requiring a break in the relation at high optical depths. We find that for galaxies with stellar mass M \u22c5  \u3009  10 9 M \u2299, the contribution to the rotational width from the outer regions of the disk is comparable to that from the inner regions, in agreement with theoretical predictions. However, this is not the case for galaxies with M \u22c5  \u3009  10 8 M \u2299. We discuss this in terms of the different methods of measuring the orbital speeds in the inner and outer regions of the disk."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider the properties of closed strings at vanishing temperature in AdS_2. We show that the low-energy effective action for a closed string in AdS_2 is non-critical M-theory, with the radius of the AdS_2 boundary playing the role of the string length. The high-energy effective action is described by a dimensional reduction of the effective Nambu-Goldstone action for a string in a flat space-time. The latter has a cosmological constant and a massless scalar field as basic ingredients. We calculate the effective actions for a closed string in AdS_2 with a non-trivial radius and show that the high-energy effective action has the same form as the non-critical M-theory effective action. This has the advantage that our result can be used to make non-trivial predictions for the high-energy behavior of M-theory. We also study the possible boundary conditions for a closed string in AdS_2 and find that the only boundary conditions which can be implemented are those which leave the AdS_2 bulk invariant."}
{"text":"\n\nWe motivate and establish the basis for a new approach to the problem of the origin of the inertial mass of fundamental particles. The key idea is to consider the possible roles of spontaneous symmetry breaking in the formation of the gravitational sector of the universe, and of the inertial mass of elementary particles. We show that this approach can provide a solution to the long-standing problem of the origin of the vast inequality in the masses of elementary particles, and of the relative weakness of gravity with respect to the other fundamental forces. We focus on a particular mechanism of symmetry breaking which is based on the use of a cosmological constant, and which can be applied to both the formation of the structure of the universe, and to the mass generation process. The main tool for the analysis of the proposed mechanism is the Lagrangian formalism of the standard model of elementary particle physics. Within this approach we show that the mass generation process can be described by a generalized Taylor expansion of the Lagrangian, in which the cosmological constant appears as a Lagrange multiplier which provides a correction to the mass generation potential. We evaluate this correction, and show that it is capable of generating the desired inequality in the masses of elementary particles."}
{"text":"\nWe study the supergravity solutions in a class of four-dimensional geometries which includes anti-de Sitter spaces as well as some spaces with a cylindrical or spherical boundary. In the presence of a cosmological constant, these spaces are known to be invariant under a gauge transformation which changes the signed distance function to a multiple of the absolute value of the distance function. We show that this transformation does not leave the bulk theory invariant, and this allows us to define a class of bulk theories which are invariant under this transformation. We show that this class of bulk theories includes the IIB supergravity in arbitrary dimension as well as the ten-dimensional supergravity with a (1,1) symplectic form and a cosmological constant. In this sense, the class of geometries we consider includes the most symmetric spaces in which the IIB supergravity can be realized. We also consider the recently proposed droplet description for IIB supergravity in arbitrary dimension, and we show that it can be realized in our class of geometries as well."}
{"text":"\nWe present photometric observations of the burst GRB 060614, an event which is unique in several respects. GRB 060614 was a relatively nearby burst (z < 1), and had a well behaved afterglow, with a clearly defined peak at the burst's endpoint. We find that the burst's optical afterglow had a fluence of 3.3 kJ\/m^2, and was therefore much more energetic than the afterglow of the average burst (1 kJ\/m^2). We model the time- dependence of the afterglow using a power law, and find that the index is slightly different for the two sides of the burst. The total duration of the burst (in order to observe the afterglow) was also much longer than the average burst, at 19.3 ks. We find that the afterglow of GRB 060614 is well described by a simple power law, with an index of -0.91. The burst's afterglow also shows a clearly defined peak at the burst's endpoint, which we interpret as the burst's engine shutting down. We compare GRB 060614 to several other bursts with well- studied afterglows, and find that the burst's optical afterglow was unusual in several respects. The origin of these differences is not understood, but our observations imply that the central engine of GRB 060614 was operating differently than in other bursts. We discuss several possible explanations for our observations, and conclude that further observations of similar bursts will be necessary to distinguish between these models."}
{"text":"\n\nWe investigate a class of entanglement measures which are defined on multipartite states and are invariant under local operations and classical communication (LOCC). We show that, while a general technique to construct such measures exists, there are nontrivial constraints on the set of measures that can be constructed in this way. In particular, we show that such a measure is necessarily a convex combination of the distinct entanglement measures of the bipartite states that can be obtained by squashing the multipartite state in question in a particular way. This immediately implies that such entanglement measures are not symmetric on any class of states that contains states with negative entanglement. We show further that, while there exist examples of measures that satisfy the above constraints and are not symmetric, it is not possible to construct a measure that satisfies the constraints and is symmetric on a class of states that contains states with negative entanglement. Finally, we show that if such a symmetric measure could be constructed, it would have to be the zero measure."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a study of the habitat segregation between Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs) and Lyman alpha emitters (LAEs) around a bright QSO at z~5. We find that the LAEs in the QSO's galaxy cluster are preferentially found in the same plane as the LBGs, but with a radial offset of ~4-7 kpc. The LBGs and LAEs are found in different stellar mass and star formation rate (SFR) sub-populations, with the LAEs being associated with galaxies that are on average less massive and have lower SFRs. We show that the observed segregation can be explained if the LBGs and LAEs are associated with different galaxy formation mechanisms, with the LBGs forming in galaxy-scale haloes and the LAEs forming in a gas-rich layer that is between the galaxies and the intergalactic medium. Our results suggest that the evolution of the large-scale structure in which galaxies form can directly affect the morphology of the galaxies that are produced, with discrete haloes giving rise to elliptical galaxies and a continuous intergalactic medium giving rise to smooth, spherical galaxies."}
{"text":"\n\nStudying Reionization with Ly-alpha Emitters\n\nWe present a study of the ionization structure of the Galactic globular clusters 47Tuc and Muscida. We use the cluster stars as a fossil record of the ionization history of the intergalactic medium. We find that the ionization structure is well described by a double-peak profile with a power law electron temperature distribution. We determine the ionization age of the clusters to be 1.28 Gyr and 1.70 Gyr for 47Tuc and Muscida, respectively. We discuss several possibilities for the origin of the double-peak structure and find that a model in which the ionization is produced by a cosmic ray driven wind from a supernova explosion is the most consistent with the available data. This model predicts that the ionization structure should be independent of the metallicity of the cluster, and this prediction is supported by our data. We find that a magnetic field of 3 kG in the cluster has the potential to accelerate the ionization structure by a factor of two. We discuss how observations of the ionization structure in globular clusters can be used to study the properties of the intergalactic medium and the formation history of the clusters."}
{"text":"\nWe present here results of a hydrodynamical study of the jet in the symbiotic star MWC 560 III. Our goal is to investigate the origin and the evolution of the jet in order to determine its relation with the orbital period. We show that the jet can be described by a simple model in which the accretion is assumed to be of anisotropic form. This model predicts a jet with several power-law regions. We find that the first regime of the jet, corresponding to the inner accretion disc, can be described by a power law with a power of -1.7. The second regime corresponds to a transition zone, where the power law index changes abruptly to -1.4. The third regime corresponds to the outer accretion disc and can be described by a power law with a power of -1.0. The fourth regime corresponds to the wind region, which is not self-luminous, and can be approximated by a sphere with a constant velocity. We show that the jet's mass-flow rate is proportional to the orbital period, and we explain this result by a simple model of the accretion process. We show that our results are consistent with the assumption that the jet is a result of the synchronization of the inner and the outer disc. We discuss the relation between our results and the assumption of a unidirectional jet. We also point out that a simple model of the jet is able to describe the observed correlation between the jet's mass-flow rate and the orbital period."}
{"text":"\nWe consider a stochastic particle system with degenerate death rates, a setting that appears in many models of population dynamics, such as the competition for resources or the fight against pests. Such systems are typically described by a system of differential equations with Piecewise constant coefficients. We derive a simple asymptotic formula for the statistical moments of the distribution of the number of particles, in terms of the moments of the underlying family of probability distributions and the entropy. In particular, we show that the resulting moments are equal to the solutions of a system of differential equations with Piecewise smooth coefficients, in which the rates are smoothed out in a neighbourhood of the origin. As an application, we consider the statistical problem of identifying the underlying family of probability distributions, in the case where the particle system is observed at a finite number of time-points. We show that this problem can be reduced to the problem of determining the coefficients of a Piecewise smooth differential equation."}

In this article, we consider the particular case of a weakly asymmetric double-pulse test configuration, which allows us to test the strong equivalence principle (SEP) to second post-Newtonian order (PN2). In our previous work, which considered a symmetric double-pulse test configuration, we found that thePN2 equations of motion exhibited a form of constraint relaxation, in which the structure of the constraint surface was different in the two post-Newtonian frames moving at different speeds. This finding was inconsistent with the strong equivalence principle, and we were able to show that this inconsistency could be resolved by introducing a small non-singular structure on the constraint surface.

{"text":"\n\nWe show the minimal probability of ruin of a portfolio of finite-lived assets is regular for any finite probability measure. We accomplish this by establishing a one-to-one correspondence between stopping rules for a game of stopping and control and the behavior of the minimal probability of ruin. Stopping rules for which the minimal probability of ruin is regular correspond to stopping strategies that guarantee the ruin of the player who stops last. We show the minimal probability of ruin is finite for any stopping rule if the underlying probability measure is regular in the stopped state. We show the minimal probability of ruin is infinite if the stopping rule is the first to stop strategy for a game of stopping and control in which the underlying probability measure is not regular in the stopped state. We give an example of a stopping rule for which the minimal probability of ruin is infinite. As an application, we show the minimal probability of ruin of a portfolio of assets is regular if the underlying probability measure is regular in the stopped state.

{"text":"\n\nWe present observations of the peculiar Type Ib supernova (SN) 2006jc, made with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and the Keck Observatory. We find that the mass of the supernova (SN) is at the low end of the accepted range for Type Ib SNe and that the accretion phase lasted for approximately 2.4 times longer than the average for this class of SNe. We find that the gas density in the inner few tens of stellar radii is consistent with a nearly constant density, which is slightly higher than the average density of the outer shell. This result suggests that the inner portion of the accretion shell is less affected by the turbulence and mixing induced by the accretion process than the outer shell. The high gas density in the inner shell could also account for the late-time radioactivity, which is stronger than that expected from a SN with a mass similar to that of 2006jc. We discuss the possible mechanisms that could have produced the observed inner shell density structure and the late-time radioactivity. We also present a possible model in which a thick accretion disk forms in the inner shell and the radioactivity is due to the decay of the accreted material in this disk."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a survey of debris trails from short-period comets, with particular emphasis on the fresh trails of recently discovered comets. We have derived the dynamics of these debris trails from a combination of observations and numerical modeling. We find that the debris trails are stochastically evolved on a wide range of timescales, from hours to years. We have identified four different types of debris trails, with different dynamical and morphological characteristics: (1) fresh trails, (2) contractor trails, (3) retrograde trails, and (4)longevity trails. We present an explanation for the different types of debris trails based on the concept of the spatial and temporal distribution of the debris. We have found that the debris in the inner part of the cometary orbit is mostly distributed in a single plane, in agreement with the predictions of the dynamics of the pristine cloud. The debris in the outer part of the cometary orbit is, instead, distributed in a volume, producing the so-called contractor trails. We have also found that a fraction of the debris is distributed in a retrograde motion with respect to the comet, producing the retrograde trails. Finally, we have found that the debris of some comets is distributed in such a way that it produces very long-lived trails, named longevity trails. We discuss the origin of the different types of debris trails in terms of the dynamics of the cloud and the relaxation of the orbits of the debris. We find that the model of the dynamics of the pristine cloud, based on the statistical properties of the phase space, is able to explain most of the features of the debris trails."}
{"text":"\nWe present precise timing observations of the X-ray pulsar 1E 1207.4-5209 made with data from the Rossi-Gtunnel retrospectroscope and the INTEGRAL observatory. We find a period of 89.12 +0.09 ms, which is consistent with the previously reported 89.25 ms. From the observation of a total of 101 orbits, we determine the gravitational redshift to be \u03b3 = 1.060 +0.009, and constrain the system binary inclination to be i < 55 deg. We determine the total system kinetic energy to be Ek = 1.4 \u00d7 1033 J, and the individual component masses to be m1 = 1.48 \u00d7 \u00a0M\u2299 and m2 = 1.25 \u00d7 \u00a0M\u2299. We find that the system has a relatively large orbital decay rate of \u03b3 = 1.75^( +0.09) \u00d7 10-13 s^( \u22121), which may imply the presence of a fourth body in the system with a mass m4 < 3.5 \u00d7 1031 J. Alternatively, we discuss a partial resolution of the system, which would imply m4 > 4.4 \u00d7 1031 J. We discuss various possibilities for the origin of the X-ray emission and find that a newly born magnetic white dwarf is consistent with our observations. The low magnetic field and large wind mass-loss rate expected for such a object are consistent with the observations of the strong 1-10 keV X-ray emission and the relatively high orbital decay rate. We discuss the implication of a weakly magnetized X-ray pulsar at birth for the evolutionary history of such objects."}

{"text":"\n\nWe propose and analyze a new method of measuring the wave function of a particle in a quantum system that includes a tunnel barrier. Our scheme is based on the idea of using the nonlinearity of the wave function in the space outside the barrier to assist the particle in tunneling through the barrier. In particular, we show that if the wave function is symmetric with respect to the position of the particle, then the probability of the particle's penetration through the barrier can be increased significantly by using a small asymmetry in the barrier itself. The scheme is relevant to a variety of quantum systems, including those with single and double barriers as well as systems with multiple particles. We analyze the proposed scheme in the framework of the practical problem of measuring the wave function of a particle in a quantum system that includes a tunnel barrier. The problem is formulated as a barrier penetration problem with a nonlinear wave function in the space outside the barrier. We show that in this case the proposed scheme can significantly increase the probability of the particle's penetration through the barrier.

{"text":"\nWe consider a meandering jet flow with constant mean velocity U that is subject to a random field of steady stresses. The random field is intended to represent the turbulence fluctuations in the flow. We investigate the behavior of small turbulent eddies in the flow and show that a statistical ensemble of these eddies is governed by a simple differential equation that is similar to the equation for the large-scale motion of the mean flow. We solve this differential equation and show that the solution exhibits a dynamically trapped stationary state that is characterized by a high concentration of small eddies near the centers of the meanders. The stationary state is stable against changes in the strength of the random stresses, provided that the ratio of the strength of the mean flow to the strength of the random field is greater than a critical value. We also derive a simple expression for the growth rate of the solution in the random field. Our results suggest that a dynamically trapped stationary state may be a generic feature of turbulent flows in meandering channels and that it is related to the phenomenon of chaotic advection."}
{"text":"\n\nWe study the effect of temporal and spatial coherence on the creation of entanglement in an optical cavity.

Our results are consistent with the entanglement being created by a successive intersection of coherent sets of elementary excitations of the cavity. We also show that if the cavity is very misaligned, the entanglement is created efficiently, but the spatial coherence of the resulting entangled state is dramatically decreased.

{"text":"\n\nThe Infrared Cloud Monitor for the MAGNUM Robotic Telescope at Haleakala\n\nWe describe a new instrument, the Infrared Cloud Monitor (ICM), an automated cloud cover monitor operating in the near-infrared. The ICM is designed to operate with the MAGNUM Robotic Telescope (MRT) at Haleakal\u0101, Hawaii. The ICM measures the amount of cloud cover between the telescope and the sky by detecting the glow from the earth's atmosphere. We describe the motivation for the ICM, the instrument's design, implementation, and operation, and the analysis of the data from the first year of operation. We find that the ICM is capable of monitoring the cloud cover at a high temporal resolution, at a level of sensitivity suitable for triggering the measurement of the optical depth of the atmosphere when cloud-free conditions are present. The ICM is an indispensable tool for the optimal operation of the MRT because it enables weather forecasts for the telescope. We also find that the ICM can be used to study the cloud properties by analyzing the non-common mode components of the ICM data."}
{"text":"\n\nWe have developed a new method to study the connection between star-forming galaxies, active galactic nuclei (AGN) host galaxies and early-type galaxies in the SDSS. Our method uses the prescription that galaxies of a given morphology tend to form stars at the same rate per unit volume. We have found a strong correlation between the star formation rate and the morphology of galaxies in the SDSS, supporting our prescription. We have also found a correlation between the star formation rate and the distance to the nearest galaxy of the same morphology. We interpret these two correlations as signatures of the star formation efficiency, which decreases with galaxy morphology and with intergalactic distance. We have found a strong correlation between the star formation rate and the gas surface or volume density, supporting the idea that the gas density is a good predictor of the star formation rate. We have developed a model that explains the correlation between the star formation rate and the gas density. In our model the star formation rate is proportional to the gas density to the power of 3\/2. We have used our model to derive the star formation efficiency as a function of gas density, and we have found that the efficiency increases with gas density, but it does not reach 100% even at the highest densities. Our results suggest that a lack of gas is not the only mechanism that quenches star formation in galaxies, and that other mechanisms, such as feedback from AGN, may also play an important role."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate the possible connections between cosmological symmetry breaking, pseudo-scale invariance, dark energy and the Standard Model. We find that the standard cosmological model with a cosmological constant can be obtained by assuming that the potential energy function for the pseudo-scale invariant Dirac fermion has a term proportional to the cosmological constant. We show that this result can be obtained by considering only the leading order in the expansion of the Universe. This approximation is equivalent to the assumption that the density fluctuations are small compared to the average density. We show that this assumption is consistent with the observations. We discuss the possibility that the cosmological constant may be related to the top-quark mass. We show that the cosmological model with a cosmological constant can be obtained as a special case of a more general model with a functional gravity term proportional to the cosmological constant. We discuss the possibility that this gravity term may be related to the Yukawa term for the top-quark mass."}

This generalizes an earlier result of Stijn van Dongen. Furthermore, we show that the variance of the number of visits to a given point is inversely proportional to the (random) area of the region containing that point. This answers a question of Osmo Vaserstein. In addition, we show that the number of different values that the random walk can take on during its first steps is equal to the number of connected components of the metric space. This answers a question of Michel Zinn-Justin. We also show that the random walk performs on average as many steps as there are connected components in the metric space.

{"text":"\n\nFundamentalist physics: why Dark Energy is bad for Astronomy\n\nWe have recently proposed a new explanation for the origin of the accelerating expansion of the Universe, which does not require the introduction of Dark Energy. Our explanation is based on the principles of the hydrodynamics of perfect fluids, which we have applied to the analysis of large-scale structure formation in the Universe. We show that this explanation is more parsimonious than the explanation based on the introduction of a new dynamical variable, which is an invention of fundamental physics, and which has no physical meaning. We also show that the conventional explanation results in a violation of the strong equivalence principle, which is the basis of the theory of general relativity. Our explanation avoids this violation, and it results in a model in which the evolution of the Universe is governed by the principle of minimum action, as in the theory of general relativity. We show that our explanation has a simple physical meaning, and that it can be derived from a minimal modification of the conventional theory. We show that our explanation is compatible with the standard cosmological model, and that it leads to a minimal modification of the standard cosmological model. Our explanation is consistent with the observed accelerating expansion of the Universe, and it does not require the introduction of Dark Energy."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a catalog of X-ray source counts in the COSMOS field, a square degree survey area in the Leo-Corvus border region observed with the Chandra X-ray Observatory.

We describe the data products used to generate the catalog and discuss the associated data quality. We analyze the X-ray point source counts in the context of cluster membership and group membership, and we find that they are in good agreement with previous analyses of X-ray source counts in the region. We also discuss the reliability of the source counts as a function of count statistics and find that for most of the region, a few hundred counts is sufficient to reliably derive the X-ray source count density. We provide a comparison of our X-ray source counts with recent optical and radio source counts in the region and find that the X-ray source count density is generally consistent with the density derived from the other two bands, with the exception of a few regions where the X-ray source count density is higher than the density derived from the other two bands. We discuss this finding in the context of possible cluster member selection effects and find that the most likely explanation is that the X-ray sources are preferentially selected in dense regions, while the optical and radio sources are preferentially selected in relatively empty regions. We conclude by discussing future work based on the COSMOS X-ray source counts, including the analysis of the X-ray properties of the sources and a comparison with X-ray source counts from other regions."}

Our approach is based on the generation of different signatures for each individual, where each signature is formed by a set of attributes that are extracted from a set of reference images. The proposed protocol is based on three main steps. The first one is the registration of the users, where a set of images of each user is obtained and stored. The second step is the definition of the attributes that will be used for the generation of the signatures. In this step, the set of images of each user is analyzed, in order to extract the most relevant features that can be used for the generation of the signatures. The third step is the generation of the signatures and the training of the classifier. The obtained signatures are used to train a classifier that is capable of distinguishing between the signatures of the different users. The obtained signatures can be considered as a kind of footprint of the user, which can be used for the identification process. The proposed protocol has been tested with a database of images of different individuals, and the obtained results show that our protocol is capable of identifying the users with a high degree of reliability, even when the images used for the identification are not the ones that were used for the generation of the signatures."}
{"text":"\nWe extract the ${\\bar q}q$ condensate for light quarks beyond the chiral limit in models of QCD. The motivation for this research is to understand the mechanism of the extraction of the ${\\bar q}q$ condensate and to study the physical properties of the extracted condensate in the limit of small quark masses. The key ideas and methodology are to use the monopole representation to calculate the transition amplitudes of the weak interaction and to use the resulting amplitudes to extract the ${\\bar q}q$ condensate. The results obtained are that the extracted ${\\bar q}q$ condensate has a mass and a condensate density, and that the condensate density has a maximum value and a fast-flavor-changing (FFC) structure. The problem this work attempts to solve is to understand the mechanism of the extraction of the ${\\bar q}q$ condensate and to study the physical properties of the extracted condensate in the limit of small quark masses. This work has practical and theoretical applications in the study of the strong interaction and in the extraction of the ${\\bar q}q$ condensate."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present new observations of the Spitzer IRS spectra of disks around T Tauri stars. Our data include the first spectral scans of six T Tauri disks in the star-forming region Klein Bottle. We focus on the disk structure and chemical properties. We find that the inner disk structure is consistent with the known single-zone structure, except for two objects, where the structure is more complex and may contain multiple zones. We find that the surface density distribution in the outer disk is not uniform and that it decreases towards the outer edge. The chemical composition of the disk surface in the outer region is similar to that found in the inner disk. We find that the lines of [Ne II] at 4754 and 4764 \u00c5 are formed in the inner disk, while the lines of [Fe I] at 6basic sets of clusters, lines at 4597 and 4633 \u00c5 are formed in the outer disk. The lines of H_2 gas-phase, which were previously reported to be absent in the disks around T Tauri stars, were found in our Spitzer data. The lines appear to be formed in the inner disk, except for Klein Bottle E, where they are formed in the outer disk. We discuss our results in the framework of simple models of disk structure and chemistry."}
{"text":"\nWe consider a two-dimensional one-component quantum plasma in a half-space. We find that the correlations in the bulk are well described by a sum rule, in spite of the fact that the system is not well-ordered. In this way, we show that an understanding of the correlation functions in a disordered system can be obtained by a sum rule, in a similar way as it is done in ordered lattices. The method is based on a rigorous mathematical treatment of the inquired correlation functions, by means of the single index quasiparticle formalism. The main difficulties in the derivation of the sum rules are twofold: first, the half-space is an open system, and therefore the correlations are influenced by the potential applied to it; second, in a two-dimensional half-space the singularities of the correlations are very delicate, and care must be taken in the evaluation of the singular contributions to the correlation functions. We show that both these problems can be circumvented, and a sum rule for the correlation functions can be obtained."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a geometric construction of the quasi-equilibrium grid algorithm and use it to derive a simple analytical expression for the reduced potential function. The quasi-equilibrium grid algorithm is an efficient method for obtaining a approximate basis of the relaxed potential function in an iteratively motivated basis pursuit algorithm. We show that our construction can be used to derive a simple expression for the reduced potential function that is accurate close to the boundaries of the atoms and in the limit of a large number of atoms. The resulting algorithm is very simple and is shown to be capable of converging quickly to a good approximation of the reduced potential function. We also show how the geometric construction can be used to derive a simple formula for the best basis of the reduced potential function in the least squares sense. The simplicity of the formula allows one to easily control the bias of the approximation by changing the number of basis functions and the strength of the relaxing Potential."}
{"text":"\nWe have investigated the bandstructure and optical properties of $\\alpha-LiIO_{3}$ crystal. The bandstructure was calculated by using the first-principles method based on the density functional theory (DFT). We found that the $\\alpha-LiIO_{3}$ has a direct bandgap of 3.8 eV at the $J=1-0$ point in the $\\mathrm{ABAC}$ (face centered cubic) structure. The electronic structure analysis showed that the bandgap is originated from the hybridization between the $\\mathrm{O}$ and $\\mathrm{Li}$ atoms. The bandedges are slightly shifted to the $\\mathrm{Li}$ sublattice from the $\\mathrm{O}$ sublattice, which can be explained by the larger atomic number of $\\mathrm{Li}$ and the smaller atomic size compared with $\\mathrm{O}$. In addition, we found two types of dumbbell-like hole states located at the $\\mathrm{Li}$ sublattice. The optical absorption spectrum was also calculated by using the DFT method. The results showed that the absorption edge was red-shifted with respect to the bandedge, and the absorption coefficient was higher in the visible region compared with the UV region. The $\\alpha-LiIO_{3}$ crystal was found to be a promising material for photonic device applications."}
{"text":"\n\nThe survival of the mm-cm size grain population observed in protoplanetary disks\n\nThe mm-cm size population of dust grains is known to be a significant source of pollution for\nthe discs. We have observed this phenomenon in several discs. The pollution seems to be\nmore important for the evolved discs, in particular for the Herbig Be stars. The reason for\nthis is not well understood. The main hypothesis is that the pollution arises from the destruction\nof the larger (cm-m size) dust population. We present here results of numerical simulations\nof dust evolution in discs. We find that the pollution is an outcome of the conservation of the\nangular momentum: the faster the large grains move, the more efficiently they destroy the\nsmaller ones. We observe that the time scale for the complete destruction of the small\npopulation is very short (of the order of 10 thousand years), while the lifetime of the disc\nis several million years. Therefore, in agreement with the observations, we conclude that\nthe mm-cm size population has to be a survivor. We discuss the evolutionary consequences\nof our results."}
{"text":"\n\nWe study generic properties of discrete choices under social influence. We consider a setting where individuals make choices among a finite number of alternatives, where the set of alternatives is divided into two subsets, and where individuals are influenced by the choices of others. We first show that the number of individuals who choose from each subset will be equal if and only if the influence process is symmetric, that is, if and only if the effect of choosing each alternative on the choice probability of each other alternative is the same. We then consider the case where the number of alternatives is a constant, and show that the fraction of individuals who choose from each subset converges to the generic proportion of alternatives in each subset as the number of individuals increases, provided that the influence process is symmetric and that the initial conditions are chosen in a symmetric way. We also show that in a more general setting, the fraction of individuals who choose from each subset converges to the generic proportion of alternatives in each subset, provided that the influence process is symmetric. We show that our results generalize previous results in this area, and that they provide a useful abstraction of several settings where choices are influenced by the choices of others."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a study of the Sulphur abundances in a set of F and G stars in the solar neighbourhood. We have used high-resolution spectroscopy in the 1045 nm region to derive the molecular band strengths in a sample of 20 stars with solar abundances and another sample of 16 stars with sub-solar metallicities. We find that the molecular band strengths are in good agreement with the trends predicted by chemical evolution models, confirming the reliability of these models in the regime of low metallicities. The stars in our sample with sub-solar metallicities show a clear correlation between their molecular band strength and their galactic orbit, with the highest strength being found for stars in the inner Galactic halo and the minimum strength in the outer Galactic disk. We have also derived absolute abundances for a subset of the sample and we find that the molecular data are consistent with the abundances derived from other optical lines. We discuss our results in the framework of chemical evolution models and galactic chemical distribution."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present high-precision lithium abundances for 92 turn-off stars in the globular cluster 47 Tuc. The stars were observed with the UVES and FIES spectrographs on the ESO Very Large Telescope, as part of the Milhook Acid-Base Ratios in Globular Cluster Stars (MABGCS) program. The average lithium abundances are close to the primordial abundance, but there is a clear outlier population of stars with abundances much lower than this, consistent with previous observations of the field. The projected rotation velocity of the cluster is the primary segregation criterion for the lithium abundance. The observed correlation between lithium abundance and rotation velocity implies that the lithium abundance is lowered by tidal mixing, but there are other factors that probably contribute to theallaxing of the observed lithium abundances. We find no evidence of a relation between lithium abundance and either the silicon abundance or the nitrogen abundance, both of which have been proposed as possible segregation criteria. We also present high-precision abundances of magnesium, which is not affected by any known segregation mechanism. The observed correlation between magnesium and lithium abundances implies that the difference between the average magnesium and lithium abundances is largely due to the presence of the low-liability stars. We discuss various models that may explain the observed correlations."}
{"text":"\nWe develop a simple mean-field model for the solar cycle that is based on the hypothesis that the solar magnetic field is influenced by a combination of a secular trend and a series of periodically oscillating terms. We show that the model is able to reproduce the main features of the solar cycle, including the occurrence of sunspots, their latitudes, and the length of the cycle. We use a Monte Carlo technique to investigate the sensitivity of the model to the choice of the model parameters and to the input series of periodically oscillating terms. We show that the model can be used to predict the future development of the solar cycle. In particular, we find that the model is able to predict the occurrence of a solar maximum several years in advance with a probability higher than 0.5. The prediction is based on the knowledge of the current level of solar activity and on the previous evolution of the cycle. We discuss the relevance of our findings for understanding the underlying physical processes that give rise to the solar cycle."}
{"text":"\nWe have developed a new method to test the dark energy hypothesis by monitoring the evolution of cosmological redshift. Our method is independent of the choice of the distance metric and does not require a high confidence in the distance measurements. We show that our method is more sensitive to the evolution of the distance than the conventional method. This is because the conventional method uses the instantaneous distance measurements while our method uses the average distance measurements. Also our method is less vulnerable to systematics in the distance measurements. We show that our method can detect a slow-down of the evolution of the redshift at the 3sigma confidence level if the evolution of the distance is slowed down by a factor of  \u223c 2. We also show that our method can detect a fast-rise of the evolution of the redshift at the 3sigma confidence level if the evolution of the distance is accelerated by a factor of  \u223c 2. We estimate the systematic uncertainty in our method and show that our method is comparable to the conventional method in this respect. We also discuss the prospects of measuring the evolution of the redshift with the Next Generation Failure (ngc)."}
{"text":"\n\nWe study the emerging field of cognitive networks, which aims at capturing computational principles in the design of network structures that are inspired by the brain. We consider a general framework that captures both the static structure and the dynamics of information processing in such networks. Based on this framework, we establish scaling laws that relate the functional complexity of the network to the number of its components and to the dynamics of information processing. Within this framework, we show that both the static structure and the dynamics of information processing have a critical role in determining the functional complexity of the network. We find that the number of connections follows a power law, which is a simple form of the scaling law, and show that this is consistent with a critical role of the number of connections in determining the functional complexity of the network. We also find that the dynamics of information processing follows a log-normal distribution, which is a more complex form of the scaling law, and show that this is consistent with a critical role of the dynamics of information processing in determining the functional complexity of the network. Our results suggest that both the static structure and the dynamics of information processing are important for the functional complexity of the network."}
{"text":"\nWe study the supercurrent and the density of states in diffusive SNS junctions in the presence of nonideal interfaces and spin-flip scattering. We consider a junction with a diffusive insulator between two normal metal regions, and a junction with a diffusive normal metal region between two insulators. The effective resistance of the diffusive region is described by the diffusion equation. In the first case the problem is solved analytically by the use of the so-called transfer matrix method. We obtain the total density of states and the supercurrent as a function of the applied voltage for a diffusive SNS junction in the presence of a normal metal region and a diffusive insulator region. In the second case we solve the problem by a numerical method, and we show that the supercurrent in the diffusive normal metal region depends sensitively on the width of the diffusive region, and on the applied voltage. We find the density of states in the entire junction for a diffusive normal metal region and two diffusive insulator regions. The results show clearly the effects of nonideal interfaces and of finite sample size on the supercurrent and the density of states."}
{"text":"\nWe propose a formulation for the problem of yield design in the presence of a flow in a porous medium. This is an original approach to this problem, based on the definition of an approximate pressure field. It leads to a set of coupled equations which are simpler than the Navier-Stokes equations, but still have all the physical effects related to the flow in the medium. The difficulty of the problem lies in the fact that the pressure field is not anymore a differential equation, as in the case of the Navier-Stokes equations, but an integral equation which involves a double integral. Therefore we have developed an original method based on the introduction of a parameter which allows to transform the integral equation into a differential equation. The resulting formulation is therefore much simpler and can be solved analytically. We have tested our approach on simple test cases, and the results are in good agreement with the solutions obtained with the Navier-Stokes equations, for various values of the flow velocity."}
{"text":"\n\nPower control algorithms for CDMA networks based on large system analysis\n\nIn this work, we present a large system analysis of power control (PC) algorithms for code division multiple access (CDMA) networks, specifically for the uplink, in which the users are assumed to share the same frequency. We consider the basic PC algorithms used in CDMA networks, i.e., the up\/down-step PC and the quality-based PC, and we study their large system performance. We derive closed-form expressions for the PC commands and the system-wide power efficiency, in terms of the key system performance metrics, i.e., the noise rise and the number of users. By analyzing the behavior of these expressions, we identify the conditions under which the two PC algorithms perform similarly and the conditions under which the up\/down-step PC outperforms the quality-based PC. Our analysis also allows us to derive the large system behavior of a PC algorithm that combines the up\/down-step PC and the quality-based PC, which is currently used in practice. Finally, we comment on the practical implications of our results."}
{"text":"\nWe introduce a density functional based on the fundamental measure of a broad class of geometrically frustrated systems, including the fluid of aligned hard hexagons. We show that, after a suitable rescaling, this density functional reduces to the Functional Interactions Picture (FIP) and to the Girifalco-Cappelleri-Mayoral (GCM) density functional in the thermodynamic limit. We analyze the effects of a large scale symmetry and of a break in this symmetry on the resulting density functionals. We show that the latter may have a very different behavior, depending on the specific type of the break. As an example, we consider the case of a break in the translation symmetry along a lattice direction and show that the resulting density functional can be very well described by a two-dimensional (2d) FIP with a certain type of long-range interactions. We analyze the connection between this result and the appearance of a 2d fluid of aligned hard hexagons in certain geometrically frustrated systems."}
{"text":"\n\nPower control and receiver design for energy efficiency in multipath\n  CDMA channels with bandlimited waveforms\n\nThis paper investigates the effect of channel multipath on the design of wireless CDMA receivers with a focus on energy efficiency. We consider a scenario where the base station (BS) employs a low duty-cycle strategy to reduce its power consumption. In particular, the BS turns off its amplifier during periods of low traffic and uses a wake-up signal to activate the amplifier when a new user needs to be served. The design of the wake-up signal as well as the design of the receiver at the mobile station (MS) are addressed. In order to improve the energy efficiency of the receiver at the MS, a low-power strategy is considered where the MS activates its receiver only during the duration of the wake-up signal. This strategy is shown to significantly reduce the energy consumption at the MS while still achieving a high detection probability of the wake-up signal. In order to characterize the energy efficiency of the receiver, the concept of the average number of detected bits per energy unit ( avg_bits\/ E) is introduced. The analysis shows that the energy efficiency of the receiver is proportional to the avg_bits\/ E. Since the channel multipath has a negative impact on the avg_bits\/ E, the analysis also shows that the channel multipath has a negative impact on the energy efficiency of the receiver. We analyze the effects of channel multipath on the avg_bits\/ E and show that the performance of the receiver can be significantly improved by using a rake receiver architecture at the MS. In particular, the use of a rake receiver with a large number of fingers is shown to achieve a high avg_bits\/ E even in channels with a large amount of multipath. The analysis also shows that the performance of the receiver is not affected by the large delay of the wake-up signal."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a lattice QCD study of a five-quark hadronic molecule, i.e. a bound state of five light quarks (up, down, strange, charm, and bottom quarks) with no associated gluon degrees of freedom. We consider the ground state, as well as several excited states, of this system. We find the ground state to be degenerate, with two different possible forms of the hadronic molecule, which we refer to as the light (up, down, strange, charm) and heavy (up, down, strange, charm, bottom) quark-antiquark pairs. The light pair is more tightly bound, with a larger total quark charge, and thus is more susceptible to corrections due to the non-perturbative QCD Glauber model. The heavy pair is slightly unstable with respect to the light pair, and thus will eventually thermalize to the light pair in the limit of large lattice size. We present results for the ground state, as well as the low-lying excited states, of this system, and discuss the implications of our results for the future study of hadronization from a lattice QCD perspective."}
{"text":"\n\nWe introduce a new concept, the bounded pushdown dimension, and show that it has several important properties in common with the Lempel-Ziv (LZ) information density. We show that the bounded pushdown dimension is equivalent to the LZ information density up to a constant factor, and that the bounded pushdown dimension is tightly related to the pushed-down complexity of a string. We show that for any fixed bound B, the bounded pushdown dimension is in the same level as the LZ information density, that is, they are both polynomially bounded on the average number of letters per string. We show that for any fixed bound B, the bounded pushdown dimension is in the same level as the maximum LZ information density, that is, they are both exponential in B. We show that the bounded pushdown dimension is in the same level as the LZ information density, that is, they are both equal to the log of the alphabet size.

{"text":"\n\nAbstract\n\nWe present a detailed study of the mass loss from cool giants in general, and from red giants in particular, due to their stellar winds. We focus on the important role of the chemical and physical properties of these winds, which are generally believed to be isothermal, homogenous, and fully ionized. We show that if the winds are not treated as being perfectly Knudsen, the mass-loss rate is significantly underestimated. We derive an expression for the mass-loss rate that includes a correction term proportional to the wind's Knudsen number. We find that this term can increase the mass-loss rate by one order of magnitude for winds with a large scale height and a small Knudsen number. The parameter space in which this effect is significant is relevant to cool giants, and in particular to red giants, because their winds are often highly non-equilibrium, with large-scale structures and long electron orbits. Our results have important implications for our current understanding of the evolution of giant stars and their surrounding planets."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present an analysis of polar broad absorption line quasars (BALQs) that utilizes both the intensity and the velocity structure of the quasar absorption lines. The data set consists of 26 BALQs with high signal-to-noise ratio (S\/N) spectra, acquired with the Hubble Space Telescope. We find that the quasar absorption lines in all cases display a positive velocity gradient, i.e., the lines are blue-shifted in the direction of the systemic velocity. The line-center velocities are systematically higher than the systemic velocities, except in the case of a peculiar broad absorption line source (BALS) with many narrowly spaced absorption lines. We discuss this finding in the framework of simple models in which the quasars are treated either as single-temperature objects or as multi-temperature objects with a distribution of temperatures. We find that in all cases the model predictions are consistent with the data, except in the case of the peculiar BALS, for which the model over-predicts the systemic velocity by a large margin. Our results suggest that the nature of the absorbing material in polar BALQs is different from that in classical non-polar sources: the absorbing material in polar sources is either (1) a large number of small clouds, each having a small velocity offset with respect to the systemic velocity, or (2) a small number of large clouds, each having a large velocity offset. We discuss this difference in the framework of the classical picture of a large rotating disk with a radiative core and an accretion disk, and suggest that this picture is not consistent with the observed velocity structure of the quasar absorption lines in polar BALQs."}
{"text":"\nWe present observations of the subdwarf B stars HS 0039+4302 and HS 0444+0458 in a high-resolution mode of the High-resolution Echelle Spectrometer (HIRES) on KeckII. We resolve the inner regions of both stars, obtaining precise radial velocities and thereby precisely determining the orbital elements. We find that both systems contain one more giant planet than had been previously inferred. In the case of HS 0039+4302, the giant planet has a mass 1.4 times that of Jupiter and is the most massive giant planet found in a subdiver B star. This giant planet is close to the 2:3 mean-motion resonance with the host star. The large mass of this giant planet suggests that it has been stabilizer by the orbital resonances. We find that the giant planet in HS 0444+0458 has a mass 0.8 times that of Jupiter. We determine that both subdwarf B stars are members of the Lynx sector, but they are not members of the same group. We determine the orbital elements of all the giant planets in the two systems to high precision, and find that the orbits are consistent with being coplanar. These data therefore resolve several outstanding issues regarding the properties of giant planets in subdwarf B stars."}
{"text":"\nWe developed a new technique based on multilevel analysis of single-molecule fluorescence data that enables us to quantitatively study the dynamic properties of DNA-protein complexes in living cells. Our approach is based on the idea of relating the different conformational states of a DNA-protein complex to the strength of the complex's fluorescence signal. We used this approach to study the conformational dynamics of a DNA-binding protein, the NF-kappaB p65 subunit, in living HEK-293 cells. Our results show that the p65 protein switches between two distinct conformational states, a compact state and an extended state. Furthermore, we found that the protein dynamically switches between these two states. We also show that the compact state is more stable than the extended state, and that the transition rates between the two states are several orders of magnitude slower than the diffusive behavior of the protein in the extended state. Our results suggest that the NF-kappaB p65 protein performs multistep conformational changes in living cells. Our new approach for studying conformational dynamics of DNA-protein complexes in living cells could be generally applied to other proteins and biological processes."}
{"text":"\nWe present a study of the evolution of the radio spectral and temporal structure of a large impulsive solar flare, which was observed on 2017 February 14. The radio emission in this flare is dominated by a number of small-scale impulsive transients, which exhibit extremely fast evolution in both spectral and temporal domains. Our analysis reveals that the transient sources maintain their identity in the radio sky over the course of the flare, with their locations shifting only by a few tens of kilometers. We find that the spectral and temporal evolutions of these transient sources can be described by a simple model in which a small-scale impulsive phase is followed by a large-scale slowly-decaying phase. The initial impulsive phase of each transient has a duration of about one minute, during which the radio flux density increases rapidly from a few Jy to about 100 Jy, and then decreases with a time constant of about 30 seconds. The large-scale phase exhibits a steady decay of the radio flux density with a time constant of about 1800 seconds. We estimate the size of the emitting region to be about 10 \u2212 100 km across. Our results suggest that small-scale impulsive processes can produce large-scale slowly-decaying radio emissions in solar flares, and the combination of these two types of processes can explain the diversity of radio spectral and temporal structures observed in solar flares."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present high spatial resolution (19.5 ''') imaging observations in the near-infrared (NIR) and X-ray of the peculiar galaxy G70.7+1.2. We find that the nuclear region of G70.7+1.2 is populated by a number of sources, including an unresolved supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the galaxy's center. The NIR and X-ray images are not well-correlated, indicating that the nuclear region is probably strongly coupled to the circumnuclear region. We find that the non-SMBH sources in the nuclear region are too bright to be explained by accretion onto a SMBH. A simple model in which a SMBH is surrounded by a ball of hot gas can quantitatively explain the observed NIR and X-ray emission from the central region. However, the SMBH mass required is much larger than the galaxy's total stellar mass, suggesting that this SMBH has accreted gas from its surroundings. We discuss two possible physical mechanisms for this: a wind driven by the SMBH and the tidally stripping of gas from a SMBH's accretion disc. Our results suggest that SMBHs can have a profound impact on the evolution of their host galaxies."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a method of constructing the fundamental plane of Sunyaev-Zel'dovich clusters using the pairwise correlation function of the thermaletto-via contribution. The method is based on the analogy between the inverse power-law correlation function of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect and the pairwise correlation function of the gaussian contribution to the cluster temperature. We show that the correlation function of the thermaletto-via contribution can be expressed as a function of the correlation function of the total cluster temperature, the variance of the total temperature and the ratio of the power law indices of the correlation functions. We show that this expression can be used to constrain the fundamental plane of Sunyaev-Zel'dovich clusters. We apply this method to a sample of clusters selected from the catalogue of the 2 Micron All Sky Survey and find that the constrained fundamental plane is consistent with the assumption of a single power law index for the correlation function of the total temperature and the correlation function of the thermaletto-via contribution. We discuss our results in the framework of the standard model of cluster formation."}
{"text":"\nWe present here the results of a systematic and quantitative analysis of the spectral index distribution of EGRET blazars. A total of 252 EGRET blazars are considered, all of them with measured redshifts and taken from the second version of the EGRET blazar database. We find that the distribution of their spectral indices is significantly different from a Gaussian distribution. The most significant departure is found in the high-frequency part of the distribution, where the majority of the blazars present indices smaller than -1. We discuss this non-Gaussianity in the framework of a simple model in which the production of the UV and X-ray emission in blazars is related to the accretion disc instability. Within this framework, we show that the non-Gaussianity can be naturally explained by the large-scale distribution of the accretion disc matter, if the disc is subject to violent kinematic instabilities. We also show that the distribution of the accretion disc matter has to be very close to a Gaussian one, in order to reproduce the observed distribution of the spectral indices. The quality of the fit is better if we allow the index to be dependent on the redshift, in a way consistent with the change in the properties of the accretion disc with redshift. We discuss the prospects of using this distribution to test the disc instability model and to select blazars with extreme accretion disc instabilities for further study with GLAST."}
{"text":"\nAdding Environmental Gas Physics to the Semi-Analytic Method for Galaxy Formation: Gravitational Heating\n\nWe extend the semi-analytic method for galaxy formation to include the effects of gas heating and cooling in a simple manner. We show that the method is very sensitive to the feedback of gas heating on the galaxy formation process. In particular, the inclusion of gas physics can produce galaxies that are more compact, with higher central mass, than those produced by the standard semi-analytic method. We analyze the physical origin of this effect and find that the main contribution comes from the cooling of gas in the outer parts of the galaxy, due to the increase of the surface area with the expansion of the galaxy. We quantify this cooling effect and find that it is in agreement with the results of other recent studies. We also analyze the effects of gas heating in the inner part of the galaxy, and find that they are less important than the cooling effect in the outer regions. We also discuss the effects of other physical processes, such as gas dynamical friction, and find that while they are important in shaping thegalaxy structure, they do not modify the main conclusion that we obtain by including gas cooling in the semi-analytic method."}
{"text":"\nWe present a simple method to extract the ages of solar-type stars in the solar neighbourhood, based on the correlation between stellar age and metallicicity. This relation is derived from a sample of Main Sequence stars in the solar neighbourhood with ages between 1 and 8 Gyr, as inferred from the stellar metallicity and the apparent gas-richness of their disks. Our method is based on the empirical correlation between stellar age and metallicicity, and on the measurement of the metallicicity of the disk of each star. We show that our method is independent of the distance to the star, disk debris, the skill of the analyst, and the precise measurement of the stellar metallicicity. Our method is precise enough to distinguish between solar twins, which are very similar to the Sun, and solar analogs, which are somewhat different from the Sun. We find that the nearest solar twins are between 1.5 and 2.2 kpc away from the Sun. We also find a correlation between the orbital period of the disk and its metallicicity, which we use to infer the disk age. We find that most of the disks in the solar neighbourhood are between 1 and 3 Gyr, but that the disk age distribution is not uniform, and that there are several populations of disks with different ages. We find that around 70% of the disks are relatively metal-poor, and young, between 1 and 2 Gyr. We also find a significant number of old, relatively metal-rich disks, with ages between 2 and 3 Gyr. We discuss these results in the framework of planet formation theory, and suggest that the different populations of disks correspond to different stages of the planet formation process."}

Our method is based on measuring the frequency and duration of gravitational waves (GWs) generated during the plunge and subsequent oscillations of a neutron star (NS) into a black hole (BH). We show that these gravitational waves can be used to constrain the parameter space of general metric theories of gravity (GMGTs), including theories that feature a non-minimally coupled scalar field, a generalization of the Einstein-Maxwell-Chern theory, or an extra, possibly nonlinear, metric degree of freedom. We consider various GMGTs and evaluate the effectiveness of our method by comparing the predictions of these theories to the latest observations of the GW source GW150914. We show that our method is sensitive to the basic structure of GMGTs, and can distinguish between theories that feature a minimally coupled scalar field and theories that do not. We also show that our method can place significant constraints on the initial condition of the NS-BH pair, including the mass of the NS and the three other parameters that define its initial orbit, and can rule out some GMGTs with relatively mild non-minimality."}
{"text":"\n\nWe investigate the dynamics of a suddenly connected Bose-Josephson junction, which consists of two superconducting reservoirs separated by a normal conducting tunnel barrier. For a range of barrier thicknesses, the system can be operated in a mode where a supercurrent flows through the barrier, and the total current through the junction is almost constant. This operational mode is in stark contrast to the behavior observed for a suddenly formed thermal junction, where the total current shows a large peak. We show that this difference is due to the fact that, in the case of a supercurrent, the total energy of the system is almost constant. In particular, we find that the supercurrent through the barrier is driven by a trapped vortex, which is formed as a result of the sudden connection. The dynamics of this vortex is influenced by the barrier thickness: for a thick barrier the vortex is quickly annihilated, while it is able to survive for a large number of cycles for a thin barrier. Our results are consistent with a model where the energy of the system is mainly governed by the kinetic energy of the trapped vortex."}
{"text":"\nWe present a comprehensive study of the non-axisymmetric structures in solar chromospheric flares, based on the observations of the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and the Solar Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO). We identify and characterize several types of such structures, including the kink-like, bipolar, and corkscrew, and discuss their possible physical origins. We find that the non-axisymmetric structures can be further classified into two groups based on their aspect ratios, where the aspect ratio is defined as the ratio of the length to the width of a structure. We show that small- aspect ratio (portrait) structures are likely to be related to the solar flux rope instability, while large- aspect ratio (landscape) structures are more likely to be related to the plasma concatenation instability. We also show that the occurrence rate of the non-axisymmetric structures is not uniform along the flare ribbons, but preferentially localized near the tips of the ribbons. We discuss this observation in the framework of a simple model in which the non-axisymmetric structures are treated as kink-like perturbations that evolve in a straight ribbon. We explain why the ribbon tips are the preferred locations for the occurrence of such structures. Our results suggest that the non-axisymmetric structures play an important role in the evolution of solar chromospheric flares and may be responsible for the kinetic energy injection into the Sun's corona."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present results of extensive molecular dynamics (MD) computer simulations of a simple model of a polymer chain. The model consists of a linear chain of monomers connected by ideal bonds and able to rotate about each bond. To avoid the ''curling up'' of the chain, a Boltzmann-like distribution of the monomer tilt is assumed. We investigate the spatial scale of the low-energy excitation of the system, which is related to the correlation function of the tilt angle. Our results show that the correlation length varies in a non-monotonic way as a function of the monomer flexibility, with a minimum in a certain range of flexibility. We also found the presence of a ''ophobic'' region in the phase diagram, where the correlation length is large and growing, in contrast to the usual ''philic'' region where it is small and decreasing. The size of the correlation length as well as its variation are in a good agreement with the available experimental data for real polymers. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved."}
{"text":"\nWe present a new method for derivation of cluster metallicity based on the colors of main-sequence stars in the horizontal branch (HB) of old stellar populations. This method does not require knowledge of cluster membership, an a priori adopted main-sequence turn-off point, or the cluster's distance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method by applying it to the globular cluster M75 in the Galactic globular cluster system. The new method is based on the observation that the colors of main-sequence stars in the HB of old stellar populations are sensitive to the cluster metallicity. The main-sequence stars in M75 are found to have colors corresponding to metallicities between 0.004 and 0.02, with a weighted mean metallicity of 0.01. This is in agreement with other independent determinations of the cluster metallicity. We derive a new quantitative measure of the effect of metallicity on the colors of main-sequence stars in the HB. We show that this effect can be explained in terms of the properties of two distinct stellar populations which co-exist in the HB and which have different metallicities. The properties of these stellar populations can be derived from the observed colors of main-sequence stars in the HB. The location of the HB in the UV depends on the cluster metallicity and can be used for derivation of this parameter. We show that the colors of main-sequence stars in M75 in the range U-V = 0.3-1.4 are well described by a mixture of two stellar populations with different metallicities, in agreement with the hypothesis of the existence of two stellar populations in the HB. We derive a quantitative measure of the location of the HB in the UV and show that this measure is in agreement with other independent determinations of the cluster metallicity."}
{"text":"\n\nA Three-Stage Search for Supermassive Black Hole Binaries in LISA Data.\n\nWe present a three-stage search for supermassive black hole binaries in data from the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), a space-based gravitational-wave detector under development by the European Space Agency (ESA). In the first stage, we search for gravity waves (GWs) from asymmetric supermassive black hole binaries with compact objects (neutron stars or white dwarfs) using the simplest possible search method: a search for extreme events in the frequency domain. We find no evidence for such binaries in a data set corresponding to three years of LISA operation. In the second stage, we search for less asymmetric supermassive black hole binaries using a targeted search method. We find no evidence for such binaries in a data set corresponding to six years of LISA operation. In the third stage, we search for more symmetric supermassive black hole binaries using a full-sky search method. We find no evidence for such binaries in a data set corresponding to nine years of LISA operation. We conclude that supermassive black hole binaries are either (1) not present in the LISA frequency band, (2) present in the LISA frequency band but have black hole masses less than $10^6 M_{\\odot}$, or (3) present in the LISA frequency band but have black hole-compact object mass ratios greater than 5:1."}
{"text":"\nWe present a stochastic algorithm to model transcription factor binding events to DNA using a random walker\/jumper representation on a 1D\/2D lattice with different affinity sites. The algorithm is based on a stochastic solution of the master equation that describes the dynamics of the corresponding random walker\/jumper system. We analyze the solution of the master equation in the limit of large number of sites and large number of bound walkers\/jumpers. In this regime the solution is shown to converge to a limiting distribution that depends only on the number of sites and the walkers\/jumpers, and not on their individual positions. The limiting distribution is shown to be consistent with the well-known model of random monomer binding to a lattice with equal affinity sites. We also analyze the solution of the master equation in the case of non-equal affinity sites and show that the limiting distribution in this case is consistent with a model of non-uniform random monomer binding to a lattice. The results of this work have important practical applications in modeling the evolution of gene expression and the development of cellular phenotypes. In addition, the theoretical results obtained in this work have implications for the theory of random walks on lattices with non-equal affinity sites, and in general for the theory of statistical mechanics systems with non-equal occupancy of the sites."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present the discovery of two exoplanets orbiting the nearby A star Ross 154. These are the first exoplanets discovered in the intermediate-mass subgiant (IMS) regime. We detected the two companions using the same data acquired by the Kepler Mission during its secondary mission, K2. The detection method is based on TTV (transit timing variation). We show that both IMS and TTV are powerful methods for detecting exoplanets, and are complementary to each other. This is the first time that TTV has been used to detect exoplanets in the IMS regime. Our data cover nearly six years of observations, and the TTV signal we detected is due to the motion of the IMS star around the galactic center. The exoplanets are in a wide orbit, and thus will not be available for follow-up characterization for several thousand years. However, our detection method and the high-precision photometry of the Kepler Mission provide an opportunity to study the evolution of the system, and in particular theIMS star, as it moves towards the red giant branch. We find that the IMS star has a mass of 1.09M\u2299, a radius of 1.34R\u2299, and a temperature of 4emplons, all within the error bars. We estimate the age to be around 7 Gyr. We determine the mass of the exoplanets to be 2.3 and 2.8M\u2299, and their radii to be 1.6 and 1.9R\u2299, respectively. We estimate the orbital periods to be around 8,000 and 6,000 days. We discuss the implications of these discoveries for exoplanet detection, the evolution of stars, and the prevalence of IMS stars in the Galaxy."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present here results of a multiwavelength study of the galaxy cluster RX J1117.4+0743 at z=0.485, in an effort to determine the role of cluster accretion in the formation of massive clusters. We find that this cluster, which is thought to be in the process of accreting a large group of galaxies, has many of the same properties as clusters that are thought to have formed through the accretion of many small groups. These properties include a large fraction of cool, blue galaxies, and a temperature-declining gas profile. We present a detailed study of the cluster's galaxies in the optical and X-ray, and show that the cool, blue galaxies are likely to be a relatively large group that has already been accreted, and that the hot gas in the cluster has not yet been strongly affected by this group's infall. We discuss the importance of this study in the context of the evolution of massive clusters, and suggest that the simplest models of cluster formation that are based on the accretion of small groups may need to be modified."}
{"text":"\nWe present a detailed study of the interaction of a GRB with a generic circumburst medium, focusing on the case of wind-driven formations. We find that in all cases the energy injection by the GRB is negligible compared to the energy already contained in the medium. This is confirmed by detailed dynamic calculations for simple ( iso-density ) and more realistic ( varying density ) wind-driven flows. We discuss in detail the various physical mechanisms that can give rise to a range of phenomena that have been observed, and we conclude that in most cases a simple ballistic description is sufficient to explain the observations. We do, however, point out a range of phenomena that require a more detailed description, and which therefore may be signatures of an interesting physics that is specific to these media. We also point out that although the energy injection by the GRB is not large, this may not be true for small perturbations on large length scales, and we discuss a range of phenomena that may be due to this sensitivity. We also point out that the interaction of a powerful GRB with a weakly ionized medium may have interesting effects, and we discuss a range of phenomena that may arise in such a case."}
{"text":"\nWe are motivated by a desire to understand the effects of diversity on outcomes important to firms. Our interest is both theoretical and empirical. The theoretical motivation is based on the idea that diversity may affect firm performance through increasing the diversity of ideas exchanged in the firm. We expect this to be the case if the diversity is structured, or if it increases the variety of skills and knowledge in the firm. The empirical motivation is based on the observation that firms with higher degrees of diversity, especially racial and gender diversity, tend to have higher levels of performance. We review the theoretical and empirical literature to develop a model of the relationship between diversity, the flow of ideas within the firm, and performance. The model is tested using a sample of firms from the Fortune 500. We find that the model provides a good fit to the data, and that the model can explain the effect of diversity on performance. Our findings suggest that diversity is good for performance, but only if it is structured and leads to the exchange of diverse ideas."}
{"text":"\nWe study the conservation laws in the framework of the principle of the least action. The least action principle allows to obtain the conservation laws as the solutions of the corresponding symmetry gradated equations. The Gradation method is based on the following idea. Let us consider a continuous symmetry in the action functional. The symmetry is transitive if the mapping which assigns to each configuration of the system the corresponding symmetry transformation is a linear isomorphism of the space of the configurations. The transitive symmetries give rise to conservation laws. If the action functional has a symmetry, then this symmetry is transitive. In this case the principle of the least action generates the corresponding conservation law. The conservation laws can be obtained also as the solutions of the symmetry gradated equations for the action functional. This method was used earlier to generate the conservation laws for a point particle and a relativistic point particle. In this paper we show that the generation of the conservation laws in the framework of the least action principle can be used to generate the conservation laws for a charged point particle in the electric field and in the magnetic field, for a point particle with internal symmetry in the presence of an external field, for a relativistic point particle in the presence of an external field and for a point particle in the potential field. The generation of the conservation laws in the framework of the least action principle can be also used for the construction of the principle of the least action itself. We give such an example for a point particle in the magnetic field and for a relativistic point particle in the presence of an external field."}
{"text":"\n\nWe introduce the concept of Physical Layer Network Coding (PLNC), a novel approach to networking that combines the Coding Theory and Information Theory with the design of network protocols. We show the fundamental limits of a communication network employing such coding and their connection to the Shannon limit. In particular, we show that such a network can in principle increase the throughput of a point-to-point link, for a given noise level, by employing physical layer coding at the expense of increased latency. We also derive a practical approximation to such coding that achieves the largest possible throughput increase within a certain delay bound. We implement this approximation in a practical way by using a combination of a decision-making algorithm at the physical layer and a stochastic codeword generator, which together form a Physical Layer Network Encoder. We show that such an encoder can achieve throughput gains that are very close to the fundamental limit, and we evaluate its performance in terms of the Shannon limit. Finally, we discuss the applications of PLNC and the need for a formalization of the definition of this new field."}
{"text":"\nWe present new estimates of the location of the Arctic East Siberian margin during the Pleistocene based on the analysis of the distribution ofammaduricrusts. The nearest Pleistocene Arctic coastline to the south of the East Siberian margin is located at approximately 55\u201360\u00b0N, where the termination of the long-term productive Bennettensonnoopetis (BSN) ice stream occurred. In the course of thelastglacialcycle, the BSN ice stream retreated first to the north, and then to the south, but did not exceed the paleolatitudeof 55\u201360\u00b0N. New data on the distribution of ammonglomerate and till in the southeastern part of theBSNice stream reveal the presence of a large thrust system, which might have served as a nucleation site for the growth of the ice stream. The results obtained cast doubt on the hypothesis that the Arctic East Siberian margin during the Pleistocene was located at higher latitudes (65\u201370\u00b0N), which had been suggested on the basis of the analysis of sediment cores from the Laptev Sea. We propose that the development of the Arctic East Siberian margin wascontrolled by the geometry of theshelfbreak, and the latitudinal migration of the Arctic coastline was mainly related to the development of theParcticice stream."}
{"text":"\nWe present here the first three-dimensional description of $B_c^-\\to X(3872)\\pi^-(K^-)$ decays in the covariant light-front approach. We consider the dynamics of $B_c^-\\to X(3872)\\pi^-(K^-)$ decays within the framework of the Energy-Momentum-Transport (EMT) approach. The key idea is to combine the evolution of the transverse momentum with the evolution of the longitudinal momentum. We solve the resulting coupled equations in the longitudinal and transverse momenta and present the complete description of the dynamics in the frame of the covariant light-front approach. We find that the three-dimensional structure of the solution is very well described by the pure eigenvector solution of the uncoupled equations. The only difference between the two descriptions is a phase factor which is related to the violation of the energy-conservation principle in the decay process. We discuss the structure of the solution in the limit of large $Q^2$ and large $\\epsilon$ and present a criterion for the phase factor to become large. We also evaluate the differential cross section in the limit $Q^2$ large and show that the two-dimensional structure of the solution is recovered in this limit."}
{"text":"\n\nWe have developed a new method to study the dynamical evolution of massive star clusters in the presence of stellar-mass black holes (BHs). Our method is based on a set of improved secular evolution simulations, which include a realistic distribution of stellar-mass BHs in the galactic field, an improved treatment of the stellar dynamics, and an updated set of initial conditions that include the effects of the feedback from the evicted massive stars. We find that the dynamical evolution of massive star clusters is significantly affected by the presence of stellar-mass BHs, and that the clusters are able to withstand only a small perturbation by these compact objects. Our results suggest that massive star clusters can become stable reservoirs for massive stars in the galactic field, unless disturbed by a massive perturbation, such as a galactic collision. We discuss our results in the context of the recent observations of the stellar-mass BH  M87* and the implications for the dynamical evolution of massive star clusters."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider the problem of constructing or characterizing (symmetric informationally stable) time-frequency based communication (STBC) codes from a representation of extended Clifford algebras. The motivation for the research is that a rich theory of time-frequency based communication (TFC) codes has been developed in the context of time-frequency analysis and synthesis, but relatively little is known about the connection between TFC codes and algebraic structures. In this work, we consider the problem of constructing or characterizing STBC codes from a representation of extended Clifford algebras. The main results show that the orthogonal and symplectic Clifford algebras over $\\mathbb C$ and the symmetric informationally stable orthogonal and symplectic Clifford algebras over $\\mathbb R$ correspond to the set of all STBC codes. As a by-product, we give a description of the symmetric informationally stable time-frequency based communication codes in terms of the modulation theory of quaternions."}
{"text":"\nWe study the deuteron threshold electrodisintegration at backward angles by using the Bonn-London kinetic energy distribution. The Bonn-London formulae are derived from the single-ended Bonetti- Analytical solution for the energy distribution of the resulting fragments of the deuteron in the threshold electrodisintegration process. We obtained the analytical expressions for theBonetti- Analytical solution in the laboratory system and in the rest system of the deuteron. The backward-angle effect in the threshold electrodisintegration of the deuteron was investigated by using these formulae. We obtained the energy distributions of the resulting fragments in the laboratory system and in the rest system of the deuteron. The energy distributions of the resulting fragments in the rest system of the deuteron were obtained in the form of the functions of the backward angles and the total kinetic energy of the deuteron. The obtained functions have the form of the exponential functions and the higher-order power functions. The threshold backward-angle effect in the electrodisintegration of the deuteron was investigated by using these functions. We obtained the practical usable formula for the threshold backward-angle effect in the electrodisintegration of the deuteron. The obtained results can be explained by the mechanism of the backward-angle effect in the threshold electrodisintegration of the deuteron."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a detailed study of the prospects for the detection and measurement of Supersymmetry (SUSY) in the focus point region of mSUGRA models with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. We evaluate the signature of the Higgs sector in this context and compare the theoretical predictions with the expected experimental signatures. We find that the main channel for the discovery of SUSY, namely the production of a pair of SUSY particles of opposite charge with a significant mass gap, has a cross section that is too small to be detected with the LHC, unless the mass of the produced SUSY particles is several TeV. However, there are several other production mechanisms that could lead to a discovery, mainly the production of a SUSY particle together with other particles with a significant contribution to the final state, such as  quarks, jets, or missing energy. We also evaluate the ability of the LHC to measure the parameters of the SUSY sector in this scenario, and find that it could provide valuable information on the SUSY particle masses and mixings, if a SUSY signal is found."}
{"text":"\nWe study the cohomology of certain types of groups. Let $G$ be a finite group, $A\\subset G$, and $H\\subset \\mathrm{Aut}(G)$ be such that $A$ is central in $G$, $H$ acts non-trivially on $A$, and $H$ is bijective on $A$.

As an application, we show that if $G$ is a locally compact group and $A$ is a conjugated central subgroup of $G$, then the class of maps $G\\to \\mathrm{Aut}(G)$ which are induced by the elements of $H$ is a cohomology class in $\\mathrm{H}^\\mathrm{ab} (G)$ if and only if $G$ is an injective tensor product."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present observations of the long-duration gamma-ray burst (GRB) 060912A, the first burst with a duration in the range similar to the very short bursts (VSBs) but with a fluence and energy deposition in the range of the \"conventional\" bursts. We show that the observed phenomenology is consistent with the emission from a spherical burst, and in addition we find that the rise time of the prompt emission is relatively long. These two properties together imply that the energy release in VSBs is distributed over a large volume, while the energy in the \"conventional\" bursts is more concentrated. This in turn implies that the VSBs are a different population than the \"conventional\" bursts, with a different physical origin. We discuss the nature of the VSBs in terms of the effects of burst energy distribution on the radiative output. We show that a simple model in which the radiative output is proportional to the burst energy density along the burst trajectory can quantitatively reproduce the observed phenomenology of the VSBs and also explain why no VSBs have been observed to date with the very high energy deposition observed in some \"conventional\" bursts. We also discuss what this distinction implies for the nature of the populations. We show that the observed burst rates for the two populations imply that the VSBs have a much higher duty cycle than the \"conventional\" bursts, a hypothesis that has been suggested on the basis of other observations but never tested. We also show that this hypothesis is consistent with the observed timing distributions, which implies that the two populations have very different origins in time. We discuss the implications of this distinction for the search for a common origin for these two populations, as well as for the physical models that have been proposed to explain the observed phenomenology of both."}
{"text":"\nWe present an experimental test of non-local realism, based on the idea that if a quantum system is prepared in a state in which the values of certain properties are non-commuting, then a measurement of one of these properties will have an impact on the value of the other property, even when this second property is measured at a distance from the first one. To this end, we prepare an entangled state of two spatially separated qutrits, and perform a joint measurement of their respective amplitudes in a particular basis. We show that the outcome of this measurement has an immediate impact on the value of the quantum state of the other qutrit, in spite of the fact that there is no communication between the two qutrits, nor between the two measurement apparatuses. Our result implies that, even when a quantum system is prepared in a state in which non-local commutativity is guaranteed by the laws of quantum mechanics, this state nevertheless has a well-defined value for the non-commuting properties, and that this value is not affected by a distant measurement of one of these properties. We also analyze a possible experimental realization of this scenario, using current technology, and find that such a realization is within the reach of current experimental capabilities."}
{"text":"\n\nDynamic condensation of water at crack tips in fused silica glass\n\nWe have carried out a systematic study of the dynamic behaviour of crack tips in fused silica glass, in order to determine the effects of the material and geometric properties of the cracks on the conditions for the formation of a meniscus. We have measured the time dependence of the position of the crack tips and of the surface tension in the capillary, as well as the static contact angle between the liquid and the solid, for a large number of crack tips, with a width of the meniscus of typically 10 \u2212 2 \u2212 10 \u2212 3 \u03bcm. We have found that the crack tip stays in a state of dynamic equilibrium, with a contact angle close to the static one, provided that the surface tension in the capillary is sufficiently high. We have derived a simple expression for the minimum value of the surface tension needed for the dynamic equilibrium, which we call the dynamic contact angle. For a given static contact angle, this dynamic contact angle depends in a simple way on the parameters of the crack and of the surface tension. We have found that for the static contact angles which we have measured, the dynamic contact angles are always higher than the static contact angles, in agreement with the fact that the surface tension in the capillary is always higher than the surface tension of the flat interface. The difference between the dynamic and the static contact angle increases with the width of the crack, and for very wide cracks it may reach a value of several degrees. We have also studied the dynamic behaviour of a Crack Tip Studded (CTS) crystal, which is used in laser technology for the detection of light signals from the crack tips. Our results show that the tips of the crack in this case do not stay in a state of dynamic equilibrium, but continue to move, and that this movement is due to the nonlinear correction to the surface tension from the gratings at the tip of the crack."}

{"text":"\n\nWe present a multi-agent approach to the self-organization of networks. Our focus is on small-world and scale-free network models based on random walks and simple local rules. We show how a large number of agents, each following these rules, can generate small-world and scale-free structures. The rules are local in the sense that they only consider the agents' immediate neighbors. We find that such agents can self-organize into efficient information-processing networks, which have short path lengths and high connectivity. The multi-agent approach enables us to study the effects of the underlying graph structure, the number of agents, and the way they move and interact. We find that the most efficient networks are obtained when the agents are allowed to move only along the edges of a lattice, a pattern that is similar to the structure of the original lattice. We also find that the scale-free degree distribution can be obtained by allowing the agents to move along the edges of a random graph, a pattern that is similar to the structure of the small-world graph. These results suggest that the multi-agent approach can be used to generate network structures that are commonly used to model information processing and communication."}
{"text":"\nWe present a simple model for the formation of Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) profiles that accounts for the effect of both the variations in the density distribution and the line-of-sight (LOS) integration. We show that this model predicts several new scaling relations for the SZ profile that are not consistent with the simple SZ model that is often used in practice. The main result of our work is a detailed analysis of the effects that various modelling choices have on the shape of the SZ profile. We show that a proper modelling of the SZ effect requires a good knowledge of the distribution of the electron temperature and density, and that this distribution can be very well described by a model in which the gas is treated as a homogeneous sphere with a constant density and temperature, provided that the sphere is big enough. We also show that in this simple model the SZ effect depends only on the total gas mass, and not on the physical size of the sphere. We derive both lower and upper limits for the relative difference between the observed SZ profile and the prediction of our simple model, and we show that these limits can be used to test the assumption of a spherical distribution. We also discuss the effects of observational biases, such as the beaming and the LOS selection effect. We show that both effects can lead to a significant overestimate of the SZ amplitude."}
{"text":"\nWe present here results of a detailed statistical analysis of the angular correlations of galaxies in the COSMOS field, based on the correlation functions of galaxies extracted from the cross-correlation of the galaxy redshift survey with the CMB temperature anisotropy. We show that the correlation functions display significant structure on angular scales of several degrees, which we attribute to the influence of large-scale structures in the form of sheets and filaments, revealed as boundaries between large voids. In addition, we find that the correlation functions display power law tails, which we show is consistent with the hypothesis that small-scale structure correlations on angular scales of order 1\u00b0 are responsible for the long tail of the correlation functions. Our results suggest that large voids are surrounded by large-scale structures in the form of sheets and filaments, and that small voids are embedded in a sea of small-scale structure, which is responsible for the long tail of the correlation functions."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a set of one-dimensional hydrodynamical models of wind driven shocks for a variety of plausible mass-transfer rates, $R_{\\mathrm{in}}$, for the recurrent nova RS Ophiuchi. Our results are consistent with the observations in several ways. First, we find that a $R_{\\mathrm{in}}\\sim 3\\times 10^{-4}M_{\\odot}$ produces a fast shock, in agreement with the observations, whereas a $R_{\\mathrm{in}}\\sim 10^{-4}M_{\\odot}$ produces a slow shock, again consistent with the observations. We also show that a fast shock at $R_{\\mathrm{in}}\\sim 3\\times 10^{-4}M_{\\odot}$ develops when the mass transfer is efficiently radiative, whereas a slow shock at $R_{\\mathrm{in}}\\sim 10^{-4}M_{\\odot}$ develops when the mass transfer is efficiently convective. We show that the inferred $R_{\\mathrm{in}}$ depends sensitively on whether the outer boundary of the accretion shock is treated as a perfect conductor or a perfect insulator. We discuss how this conclusion might be tested observationally. We also discuss the consequences of our results for the Virial theorem, and we show that the Euler-Cauchy equation is not strictly valid in this problem, because the thickness of the interface between the wind and the shocked matter is not small on the length scale of the problem."}
{"text":"\n\nWe can gain deep insights into the inner workings of complex genetic regulatory networks by studying their dynamic properties. A central question is how the network topology impacts the dynamic behavior. We show that a large class of genetic regulatory networks has a surprisingly simple and universal dynamic behavior, regardless of the network's specific topology. This behavior is characterized by a small number of independent dynamic modes, each of which can be obtained by assigning a different set of genes to be active. We show that this behavior can be captured by a simple model in which the genes are independent, and thus can be inferred without knowledge of the network topology. We present an algorithm to infer the dynamic modes from gene expression data, and show that it accurately reconstructs the modes of a synthetic genetic network with known topology. We also show that the inferred dynamic modes can be used to identify the connections between genes in a regulatory network, even when the topology is unknown. Our results suggest that the dynamics of a gene regulatory network are often simple and that this simplicity can be exploited to gain insights into how the network is wired."}
{"text":"\n\nWe study random interlacings of geometrically simple polyhedra, including an infinite family with voids of any shape, and a probability measure on their symmetric subcomplexes. We show that the random interlacings have the same kissing number as the regular one, but the number of non-void regions is generally smaller. We show how to count the number of voids of a given dimension, and we use this to prove that for large n, the probability that a randomly chosen vertex of a convex hull of an n-gon is void approaches 1\/2. We show that a random subset of the convex hull of an n-gon has a small probability of containing all the voids, and hence is an approximately random sample of the convex hull. We study percolation on random interlacings. When the interlacings are allowed to have voids, percolation is always continuous, and the connectivity probability has a sharp threshold. When the interlacings do not have voids, the connectivity probability approaches 1 as the density goes to infinity, but the percolation is not continuous."}
{"text":"\nWe consider a general framework for the semi-classical description of black hole evaporation, beyond the formalism of orthodox general relativity. We show that such a framework can be constructed by introducing an appropriate regularization procedure, which makes it possible to deal with the singularity at the horizon in a physically meaningful way. The resulting regularized evolution equations are shown to have a simple and physically meaningful structure, which is consistent with the physical requirements of the problem. The main new ingredient in our framework is a non-trivial constraint on the spacetime structure, which enters the regularization process as a non-zero external field. After constructing the evolution equations we show that they have solutions which are regularized Cauchy surfaces, and we analyze the physical implications of this fact. Our results suggest that the standard semi-classical description of black hole evaporation, which is based on the equations of motion alone, is in fact an approximation to a more general and meaningful framework which also includes the spacetime structure."}
{"text":"\n\nWe study random walk-based diffusion processes on small-world networks with distance-dependent random links. We find that the scaling properties of the stationary distribution of such processes are in general different from those of the classical random-walk processes on small-world networks with constant links. In particular, we show that the variance of the stationary distribution of a random walk process on a small-world network with distance-dependent random links increases as O(log(n)), where n is the total number of vertices, in contrast to the case of constant links, for which the variance is known to scale as O(n). We also show that the stationary distribution of a random walk process on a small-world network with distance-dependent random links is approximately given by a random walk on a nearest-neighbor graph, in which the random links are formed between pairs of vertices whose distance is at most a constant threshold. We discuss several possible practical and theoretical implications of our results."}
{"text":"\n\nWe give a simple mechanical proof of the second law of thermodynamics based on volume entropy. We show that the evolution of a mechanical system under the action of an external field can be viewed as an evolution of the volume entropy of a material particle. This approach allows one to give a simple proof of the second law without using the thermodynamic formalism. The proof is based only on the definition of entropy and the laws of motion. We show further that the volume entropy can be used to describe the statistical ensemble of a mechanical system in the thermodynamic limit. The statistical ensemble has the property that its total volume is constant. This has important consequences for the statistical theory of mechanics. We show that the mechanical work done by an external field on a mechanical system can be viewed as a contribution to the total change of the volume entropy of the system. This approach can be used to generalize the statistical theory of mechanics to an arbitrary number of degrees of freedom and to continuously deformable mechanical systems."}
{"text":"\nWe present a semi-quantitative interpretation of recent results from two experiments which probe non-standard decoherence effects in large-scale neutrino detectors. The first is a search for the elastic neutron-neutrino-nucleon scattering in the sun, which was reported by the Borexino experiment to be at most 0.17% of the Standard Model prediction, but could be as large as 4.4% in a model with an additional singlet quark-flavor quark-flavor-locked (QFL) neutrinos. We show that this could be probed more sensitively by a dedicated solar neutrino experiment with a small-scale detector in the near future, if the non-standard neutrinos are QFL and the detector has sufficient energy resolution to separate theStandard Model and QFL neutrinos. The second is a search for a non-standard decoherence effect in the large-scale KamLAND experiment, in which the assumption of a Markovian uncertainty model is shown to be violated by a surprise component in the $pp\\to e^+ e^-$ asymmetry. We discuss a possible physical origin of this non-standard effect, involving a mechanism which could also lead to a large suppression of the standard elastic $pp$ scattering in the sun."}
{"text":"\nWe present a modelling study of the polarimetric variability of hot star winds resulting from clumping of the surrounding molecular cloud. We solve numerically the radiative transfer equation in a clumpy medium, taking into account both the clumping and the non-linearity of the polarimetric response. We show that the observed variability of the polarimetric signature of hot star winds can be explained by our clumping model, provided that the clumps are sufficiently large compared to the optical depth of the medium. We find that for a given clumpy medium the variability of the polarimetric signature increases with the clump size, and it decreases with the optical depth. We also discuss the physical origin of the polarimetric variability of hot star winds in terms of the different spatial distribution of the clumps and the cloud temperature gradient. Our results suggest that the analysis of the polarimetric variability of hot star winds can provide important information on the structure and physical properties of the surrounding medium."}

{"text":"\nWe present a method to correct for the non-linear bias in the estimation of higher-order angular correlations from galaxy redshift surveys, such as the SDSS. We show that the non-linearity depends on both the galaxy color and the galaxy redshift, and that it becomes significant only for galaxies at intermediate redshifts (z < 1) and with intermediate colors (galaxy colors intermediate between the blue galaxies and the red galaxies). We then quantify the non-linear bias for several galaxy redshift surveys, including the SDSS, and we correct the correlation estimates for the non-linear bias. We find that after the correction the power spectrum is consistent with the linear bias corrected power spectrum, and the non-linear bias does not alter the conclusion that the angular correlation function is consistent with the BAO scale, at the 5% level. This correction is important for galaxy surveys at intermediate redshifts, for which the non-linear bias can be larger than the expected linear bias."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a study of star clusters in the merging galaxy NGC 3256, using high-resolution spectroscopy from the Gemini Observatory. We have obtained integrated spectra for three star clusters in the outer part of the galaxy, and have performed a detailed analysis of the stellar content and kinematics of these clusters. All three clusters show strong evidence for the presence of a substantial number of stellar knots in addition to the main cluster population. The knots show a range of projected radial velocities, but the clusters as a whole are dynamically stable, with mean radial velocities between -6 and +4 km s^-1. The metallicities of the clusters are relatively low, in the range [Fe\/H] \u2248 +0.3 to +0.8. We estimate the ages of the clusters to be in the range log(t\/yr) \u2248 9.5 to 10.3, with the most distant cluster (and the one with the highest metallicicity) being the youngest. The clusters show no evidence for an age gradient, in contrast to the Galactic globular clusters. The ages are consistent with the clusters having formed at the same time as the main body of the galaxy, during the epoch of theelliptical galaxy formation. We discuss various physical mechanisms that may have led to the formation of the star clusters in NGC 3256, and the relationship between the properties of the clusters and those of the merging galaxies."}
{"text":"\nWe have investigated the resistivity and magnetoresistance of single crystals of the heavy-fermion Kondo-hole system Ce$_{1-x}$La$_{x}$Os$_4$Sb$_{12}$ with $x$ ranging from 0 to 1, by means of a four-point probe and magnetotransport measurements. We found a non-monotonic temperature dependence of the resistivity, which exhibits a minimum at a temperature T$_{K}$ characteristic for the Kondo effect. The resistivity and the magnetoresistance also show a strong anisotropy, which is assigned to the presence of a non-magnetic d-wave ordered state, and a magnetic s-wave ordered state, below and above T$_{K}$, respectively. The s-wave to d-wave transition temperature, T$_{c}$, is temperature dependent and increases with decreasing $x$, while the critical field for the transition, H$_{c}$, decreases with decreasing $x$. Our results suggest that the competition between the Kondo effect and the magnetic ordering is strong in this system, and that the Kondo-hole effect may be responsible for the non-monotional behaviour of the resistivity."}
{"text":"\n\nWe report on a Corbino experimental set-up which we have developed for Cooper pair mass spectroscopy and for the determination of the mobility in normal phase. The set-up is based on the use of a single layer of Corbino cups on a microstrip line. The modulation frequency of the radio frequency field in the Corbino cups is kept at 6.8 GHz, and the carrier frequency at 1.37 GHz. A 100% duty cycle is used. The experimental set-up is fed with a generator for the radio frequency field, a generator for the magnetic field, a circuit for the measurement of the current, and a computer for the control of the parameters and for the treatment of the data. The operation of the set-up is similar to that of a Mass Spectrometer. We use the Ronchi-Ferry method for the determination of the mobility, and the Huffman method for the determination of the ion mass. We obtained the mobility of a polymer and we obtained the mass of several ions. We also obtained the mass and the mobility of a biopolymer in different stages of degradation."}
{"text":"\nWe present a concept for a $2\\times250$ GeV CLIC $\\gamma\\gamma$ collider based on its Drive Beam Fel-Xml-er (DBFX) and a scheme to improve its capability by a factor of two. The motivation is to provide a high statistics physics platform at an affordable cost for a wide range of physics experiments, while utilizing the full capabilities of the CLIC linear accelerator and the DBFX. The key idea is to use a tailored laser pulse to drive a relativistic electron beam in the DBFX, which is then converted to high energy photons in a nonlinear optical conversion process. We analyze the expected performance of the DBFX in this context and identify a range of design options. We show that a realistic option would provide a photon beam with an energy distribution centered around 250 GeV, with a total energy content of 2 GeV and a width of 2-3 ns. The main challenge is to achieve sufficient laser intensity to drive the electron beam at the required energy. We propose a scheme that combines several commercially available laser technologies to achieve this, and assess the required performance and the expected scalability of the concept."}
{"text":"\nWe consider the dynamics of the early universe and the initial conditions for inflation in a model with radiation and a Chaplygin gas. We use the slow-rolling approximation to solve the relevant equations of motion and find that the dynamics is governed by a single parameter that controls the strength of the potential that tends to accelerate the expansion. We show that this parameter can take on a range of values consistent with the observation that the universe is accelerating. We find that this parameter is related to the energy scale of the potential and that it must be larger than the Hubble scale in order to produce a slow-rolling solution. This scale is much larger than the scale on which the universe is observed to be accelerating. This means that some mechanism is required to bring the slow-rolling solution close to the Hubble scale. We show that such a mechanism can be provided by a term that is a finite multiple of the potential. We also show that this term must be small compared to the potential in order to produce a solution that is close to de Sitter space. We discuss the implications of this work for the question of the initial conditions for inflation."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a semi-analytic model for the evolution of the dark matter (DM) haloes in clusters, filaments, sheets and voids in a DM universe with a variable DM density profile. The evolution of the DM haloes is governed by the conservation of the total gravitational potential energy and the proper conservation of the DM mass. The main contribution to the evolution of the DM haloes comes from the relative movement of the DM particles, due to the anisotropic growth of the DM density, and the violent perturbations caused by the motion of the visible matter (VM) particles. We show that the anisotropic growth of the DM density profile induces anisotropic expansion of the DM haloes and the violation of the proper DM conservation in clusters, filaments and sheets, which results in the evolution of the DM haloes with different properties in these structures. We also find that the evolution of the DM haloes in voids is different from that in clusters, filaments and sheets due to the lack of the anisotropic growth of the DM density profile and the violent perturbations. In addition, we show that the evolution of the DM haloes with different initial properties in clusters, filaments, sheets and voids results in the DM haloes with different properties in these structures. We discuss our results in the context of the evolution of the structure of the Universe and the hierarchy of the DM haloes."}
{"text":"\nWe present a systematic study of the interplay between electron-phonon coupling and strain in perovskite manganites. We show that the temperature dependence of the resistivity in these materials can be explained in terms of a model in which the weak electron-phonon coupling isparameterized by the ratio of the Boltzmann to absolute temperatures, T\/\u221akB, where kB is the Boltzmann constant. The model also provides a quantitative description of the curious behavior of the resistivity as a function of the magnetic field, which is due to the strong strain dependence of the electronic band structure. Within this model, the temperature dependence of the resistivity is shown to have a minimum at a critical temperature, T*, which depends on the ratio of the Curie temperature to the absolute temperature, TC\/\u221akB. Our results explain the general behavior of the resistivity as a function of temperature, magnetic field, and strain in terms of a small number of parameters that can be extracted from a single measurement, without any fitting parameters."}

{"text":"\nWe present a comparison of galaxy fitting codes on a sample of strong lensing galaxies selected from the SISSA galaxies catalogue. We test the accuracy of the galaxy shape recovery from the strong lensing galaxy images, obtained using different parametric fitting algorithms, and we compare the results with those obtained using a non-parametric method, i.e. the method of moments. We find that the best-performing parametric method is the galaxy fitting code called GALFIT, developed by 1996 ApJ Nobel Prize winner Robert Wilson. We find that the fitting codes are accurate at recovering the galaxies' true shapes in most cases. We find that a small fraction (7%) of the strong lensing galaxies have very low fittings accuracy, due to the presence of extended features (like rings or tails) in the images, which are not present in the true galaxy shapes. The fraction of galaxies with very low fittings accuracy is not correlated with the strength of lensing, neither with the galaxies' redshift. The fraction of galaxies with very low fittings accuracy is slightly higher for galaxies which are very blue, i.e. with a high ratio between the galaxy's blue and total light, and it is slightly higher for galaxies in groups than for galaxies in clusters. We find that the accuracy of the parametric fitting methods is comparable to that of the non-parametric method, when the galaxies are relatively isolated, but the parametric methods are less accurate when the galaxies are in groups, especially in groups with very strong lensing. We discuss the origin of this difference and we suggest a possible way to improve the performance of the parametric methods in fitting galaxies in groups. We also suggest that the galaxy fitting accuracy can be used to test the galaxies selection criteria."}
{"text":"\nWe present the results of a numerical study of the dependence of molecular line intensities in galaxies on the properties of the clouds in which the molecules are formed. We use a simple chemical model to compute the relative abundance of different molecular species in the clouds, and we employ a one-dimensional hydrodynamical code to solve the hydrodynamics of cloud formation and evolution. We vary physical parameters to explore the parameter space, and we compute the molecular line intensities as a function of the mass of the clouds. We find that the molecular line intensity of a given molecular species is proportional to the cloud mass, but the proportionality constant depends on the species and on the physical parameters. We derive general conversion factors for specific galaxy types that can be used to convert molecular line intensities into cloud masses. Our results suggest that the mass of a molecular cloud can be estimated with reasonable accuracy by measuring the molecular line intensity of a few bright galaxies in a galaxy cluster, provided that the galaxies are of a type for which we have derived a conversion factor."}
{"text":"\nWe present an analysis of the correlation functions of the matter density, temperature, and equation of state radial distributions in dark matter halos in a LCDM cosmology. We show that these correlation functions can be related to the universal substructure distributions in the halos. In particular, we show that the correlation functions of the matter density, temperature, and equation of state radial distributions in halos are well described by a sum of multiple terms, each of which depends only on the scale of the halo. The n-th term in the sum is a functional form of the n-th universal substructure distribution. Our result provides a new approach to extract the universal substructure distributions in LCDM halos. We also show that the extraction of the exact form of the functional relation between the correlation functions and the universal substructure distributions can be non-trivial. In particular, we show that the universal substructure distributions can be related to the correlation functions by a non-trivial power law relation in a certain range of the scale of the halo. This range can be considered as a \"fossil group\" of the halos, where the evolution of the correlation functions and the universal substructure distributions is very slow. We show that this fossil group can be found by fitting the correlation functions with a power law relation. Our results suggest that the theory of halos with anisotropic accretion can successfully describe the correlation functions of the matter density, temperature, and equation of state radial distributions in halos, and provide a new way to extract the universal substructure distributions in LCDM halos."}
{"text":"\nWe present a new algorithm for computing the confidence ball surface of a cosmological model that is applicable to general Gaussian prior marginal distributions and not restricted to circular voids. The algorithm is based on a combination of the min-max and mode-maximization methods. We show that the choice of the prior marginals has a significant impact on the shape of the confidence ball surface. For example, the choice of a Gaussian prior with a large variance produces a very different shape than the choice of a Gaussian prior with a small variance. We analyze the physical implications of different choices of prior marginals on the shape of the confidence ball surface. Our analysis shows that the confidence ball surface is very sensitive to the choice of prior marginals and small changes in the prior marginals can produce large changes in the shape of the confidence ball surface. For example, a change in the variance of the Gaussian prior that corresponds to an order of magnitude change in the standard deviation produces a change in the volume of the confidence ball surface that is proportional to the cube of the variance. We show that the confidence ball surface can be described by a few parameters that correspond to physical quantities and we provide a method for computing the parameters."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a formalism for confusion and the WHIM in upcoming Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect surveys. We show that the number of galaxies in the survey region is proportional to the comoving volume and the redshift, and inversely proportional to the comoving distance. Thus the comoving number density of galaxies in a survey depends on the volume, but has no preference for a small volume, that is, it is not the fractal density of a conspiracy. For a fixed volume, the comoving number density is inversely proportional to the comoving distance, which implies that the local galaxy density does not change with the comoving distance, that is, it is a flat density field. However, the probability distribution of the galaxy number density field is not flat, but has a fat-tail. This is the so-called WHIM. We show that this non-flat distribution of the galaxy number density field naturally arises from the superposition of a large number of small, flat, and independent volume elements. We show that the probability distribution of the number density field has the power law form, and its index is proportional to the total number of galaxies in the survey region. This implies that the size of the survey region has to be large to get a significant sample of the tail, which means that a small survey cannot see the WHIM. We also derive a simple formula for the number density distribution of galaxies in the survey region. From this formula, one can find the distribution of the local galaxy number density in the survey region, and can also evaluate the significance of the sample size."}
{"text":"\nWe present a WENO-based (WENO) numerical scheme for the solution of the Euler equations in general relativity. It is a generalization of the WENO scheme recently introduced by Designing.\", \"for the solution of the Euler equations in Newtonian mechanics. Our scheme is second-order accurate in the weak-field limit and is shown to be unconditionally stable. This is demonstrated by the fact that the scheme is able to evolve small density fluctuations in an expanding universe without suffering from the gravitational singularity which is expected to occur in this case. Our scheme is capable of dealing with a wide range of physics, from hydrodynamics to highly nonlinear phenomena such as the formation of black holes and the evolution of spacetimes with a scalar field or a vector field added to the gravitational field. To illustrate this, we consider a model problem which describes the evolution of a spherically symmetric black hole in a cosmological background. We find that our scheme is able to evolve the black hole without any significant numerical artifacts, even when the black hole is highly non-linear and, in particular, when it is rotating at the threshold speed for the formation of a ring-shaped horizon."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider the possibility of detecting relativistic effects in the electromagnetic and gravitational radiation from a core-collapse supernova (CCSN) with an extreme mass ratio (M redd \/M led > 2). We show that such a supernova will have a strongly red-shifted peak in the gravitational wave (GW) spectrum, due to the relativistic velocity of the core with respect to the envelope. We find that for reasonable choices of the CCSN parameters, the peak frequency can be as large as  \u223c 100 Hz. For small mass-ratio CCSNs this is well below the natural frequency of the core ( \u223c 5 \u2013 10 Hz), but a resonance could be excited in a large mass-ratio CCSN. We also find that the frequency-dependent strain in the GW signal increases with the mass-ratio, possibly exceeding the detectability threshold for a super- Cameroni signal in a large mass-ratio CCSN. The detectability threshold for the GW burst from a large mass-ratio CCSN in advanced LIGO interferometers depends on the orientation of the GW signal with respect to the interferometer axes. We show that a large mass-ratio CCSN will produce a burst with a high-frequency content that is mostly directed either along the interferometer axes or at a large angle to them. Therefore, a large mass-ratio CCSN will be more likely to be detected than a small mass-ratio CCSN, if the burst's amplitude is equal in both cases. We also find that the spin-down evolution of a rapidly rotating core will produce a large number of rapid gravitational waves in the early core-collapse phase, possibly making the burst more likely to be detected."}
{"text":"\n\nWe introduce and study a class of domain systems, which we call statistical behavior domain systems. We give a motivation for their study by formulating several problems in statistics and probability theory in which the considered domain systems are employed. We show that the behavior of the domain systems is closely related to the statistical behavior of the observed quantities. This approach allows us to introduce and study a general setting of domain systems which are endowed with a statistical behavior and to consider statistical problems as problems of domain systems. In this way, we obtain a generalization of the classical theory of dynamical systems in the spirit of G. D. Birkhoff. The approach also allows us to study stochastic processes by means of the theory of domain systems. As an example, we consider a stochastic process which describes the statistical behavior of the trajectory of a domain system. The study of statistical behavior domain systems is an important and active field of research in the theory of dynamical systems and is related to many problems in statistics, probability theory, and mathematical physics."}
{"text":"\n\nWe have synthesized undoped TiO2 with a unique microstructure that enables magnetic hysteresis to be observed. The sample is a granular mixture of TiO2 particles (with a diameter of 50 nm) and a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) template, which is removed in the final stage of synthesis by calcining at 650 \u00b0C. The microstructure consists of nano-holes, with a diameter of 4 nm, arranged in a disordered lattice within the particles. The walls of the nano-holes are essentially amorphous, but the overall structure is related to that of the anatase phase, and therefore the magnetic properties are expected to be influenced by the anatase-to-rutile phase transition. We observed magnetic hysteresis at room temperature by measuring the magnetization as a function of the external magnetic field after applying a DC current to induce magnetization. The hysteresis loop is characterized by a small remanence and a large coercivity, which is consistent with the occurrence of magnetic domains. Our observations suggest that disordered nano-holes in anatase TiO2 particles are a possible route to induce magnetic properties in this important non-magnetic oxide."}
{"text":"\n\nWe compare two different methods to include a non-equilibrium contribution to the thermodynamic forces in particle simulations of polymeric systems: the Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD) thermostat and the Langevin thermostat. In both methods, an external field is used to introduce a non-equilibrium contribution to the total force acting on each particle. We show that these two methods can be cast into a similar formal framework, which allows for a direct comparison of the effects of the two methods on the dynamics of the system. The comparison is made for simple model systems, namely a linear polymer in a good solvent and a star-shaped polymer in a bad solvent. We find that in general the two methods do not give the same results for these model systems. The difference in the results can be explained by a different behavior of the two methods in the slow-down of the dynamics close to a singular configuration. In particular, we show that the method of Markov chains overcomes this problem, which makes it very suitable for the study of slow dynamics in out-of-equilibrium systems."}

{"text":"\nWe propose a new approach to diffraction in atom-wave optics that does not require the introduction of a relative phase shift between the wave and the atom. Our approach is based on the consideration of the effective interaction Hamiltonian between the wave and the atom. This effective interaction Hamiltonian includes not only the standard Raman-Nath interaction but also the internal atomic field. We show that the internal atomic field can have a significant impact on the effective interaction Hamiltonian, in particular in the case of high atomic losses. As a result, the effective interaction Hamiltonian can have a non-zero effective Rabi frequency even in the absence of a relative phase shift between the wave and the atom. We analyze the impact of the internal atomic field on the effective interaction Hamiltonian in different parameter regimes and discuss the conditions for which the effective interaction Hamiltonian can have a non-zero effective Rabi frequency. Our results may be relevant for various atom-wave optics experiments where the internal atomic field is not negligible, in particular in the case of high atomic losses."}

{"text":"\nWe develop integral formulas for the solution of the asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) in one and two dimensions. The motivation for this work is twofold. First, the integral formulas simplify considerably the evaluation of the stationary distribution of the ASEP and of the coefficients of the associated Markov chain. Second, the integral formulas enable us to determine the variance of the stationary distribution, which is a basic quantity in the theory of the ASEP. The integral formulas are obtained by means of a change of variables and by using a system of integral equations. The solution of these integral equations forms the bulk of the paper. The solution of the integral equations in one dimension is fairly simple. However, the solution in two dimensions is much more involved and is facilitated by using the technique of \" admirable intractability \" . The practical application of our results is twofold. The first application is in the theory of random walk in random environments. The second application is in the theory of the large deviation of random walks in random environments. The theoretical application of our results is in the theory of integral equations."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a linkage between accretion disks and blazars. We show that the accretion disks around supermassive black holes can heat the surrounding gas to a temperature capable of sustaining nuclear fusion, and thereby creating a blazar. We show that accretion disks around stellar-mass black holes can produce a jet, but not a blazar. We discuss a simple model in which a fraction of the matter in the accretion disk is heated to a temperature capable of sustaining nuclear fusion, and the rest is accreted onto the black hole. We show that in this model the accretion disk has a sharp inner boundary, and the gas pressure outside this boundary is very small. We show that in this model the accretion disk has a strong faraday Rmongodb, and can therefore be detected at radio wavelengths. We discuss a more elaborate model, in which the gas is heated by compression in the accretion disk, and by friction from the accretion disk. We show that in this model the accretion disk has a steep spectrum, and therefore produces a blazar. We show that in this model the accretion disk has a strong magnetosphere, and therefore can produce a relativistic wind. We discuss the motivation for this work, and we discuss the implications of this work for future research."}
{"text":"\nWe present photometric and spectroscopic observations of stars in the globular cluster Omega Centauri, aimed at testing the hypothesis that the cluster contains a significant population of non-solar, helium-rich stars. We find no evidence to support this hypothesis. If a significant fraction of the cluster's stars were born with helium-rich atmospheres, then the cluster would contain a population of blue horizontal branch stars. We have identified eight such stars in Omega Centauri, and find that they are extremely rare, indicating that the cluster does not contain a significant population of helium-rich stars. We also present the cluster's first catalog of pre-main sequence stars, and use these data to place an upper limit on the fraction of the cluster's stars that are born with helium-rich atmospheres. We find that this upper limit is 1.5%, which is several times higher than the fraction of non-solar stars that are known to be helium-rich. We conclude that it is unlikely that Omega Centauri contains a significant population of helium-rich stars."}
{"text":"\n\nWe revisit the diagnostics of the he-like X-ray emission line plasma in the solar wind, based on the assumption that the main mechanism of the line formation is the ionization and recombination of hydrogen. The diagnostics is based on the analysis of the shape of the he-like line, that we model as a sum of three components: a broad base line, a thermal component, and a non-thermal component. The non-thermal component is treated as a sum of frequency harmonics, which allows us to use the fast Fourier transform technique to extract the non-thermal spectrum. We derive simple analytical expressions for the he-like line shape and the non-thermal spectrum, which can be used to extract some physical parameters of the plasma, such as the temperature and density. In particular, we show that the standard assumptions of a gaussian profile for the line shape and a Lorentzian profile for the non-thermal spectrum are not necessary and that, on the contrary, a spectral shape similar to a Lorentzian with a parameter close to 2 can be derived from a line shape with a broad base line and a non-thermal spectrum with few harmonics. The parameters of this spectral shape can be related to the plasma temperature and density through a simple and robust formula. This method allows to diagnose the he-like X-ray line in a wider parameter range than the methods based on the assumption of gaussian and Lorentzian profiles. We show that this method is very sensitive to the plasma parameters and that it can be used to extract the temperature and density of the plasma even from single observations, provided that the observation is long enough to get enough statistics. As an application, we re-analyze a set of he-like X-ray observations made by STEREO\/XRT, and we show that our method allows to extract reliably the plasma temperature and density in a wide range of parameters, much wider than the range accessible with the methods based on the assumption of gaussian and Lorentzian profiles."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present new techniques to study the inner accretion flow around a rotating black hole using eclipse light curves. Our approach is based on an assumption that the accretion flow is fully radiative and its emission is governed by the temperature distribution in the inner accretion flow. We derive a simple formula for the relative brightness during the eclipse as a function of the viewing angle, the mass of the black hole, and the radius of the inner accretion flow. We show that this formula can be used to derive the accretion flow parameters in the limit of slender accretion flows. Our technique is based on a simple assumption that the accretion flow is approximately spherically symmetric and it suffices to derive the formula for the brightness on the orbit of the companion star. In this case, the parameters of the inner accretion flow can be derived from the shape of the eclipse light curve without knowledge of the absolute magnitude of the black hole. Our formula can be used to analyze light curves from recent observations of the Galactic black hole by the GRAVITY consortium and to constrain the inner accretion flow structure around a rotating black hole.\n\nWe also study the atmospheric effects of the companion star. We derive a formula for the apparent size of the companion star as a function of the viewing angle, the mass of the black hole, and the apparent size of the companion star at the beginning of the eclipse. We show that this formula can be used to derive the apparent size of the companion star without knowledge of its absolute magnitude. We analyze the systematic effects due to seeing and the blurring of the atmosphere. We demonstrate that our formula can be used to constrain the apparent size of the companion star even in the presence of significant atmospheric effects if the absolute magnitude of the black hole is known."}
{"text":"\nWe consider a problem of high-speed cylindrical collapse of two perfect fluids, each characterized by a different equation of state (EOS), and different initial conditions. We find analytically a threshold speed Vc above which the system becomes inviable, and the cylinders implode. Our analysis is based on the study of the shock wave structure, and the energy balance. We find the existence of a threshold density ratio \u03c11\/\u03c12, such that if \u03c11\/\u03c12 > Vc then the system is stable, and the implosion does not occur. In this case the structure of the shocked region is axisymmetric, and the streamline structure is unchanging in time. If \u03c11\/\u03c12 < Vc then the system is unstable, and the implosion occurs. In this case the structure of the shocked region is spherically symmetric, and the streamline structure changes in time. We obtain the evolution of the density and temperature profiles, and the streamline structure in the shocked region. We find that the shape of the imploding cylinders is not uniquely defined, and it depends on the initial conditions. For a given set of initial conditions, the cylinders implode in a few convergent finite time intervals, during which the density and temperature profiles are approximately linear functions of the distance from the center. In between these intervals the density and temperature profiles are highly non-linear, and their form depends on the initial conditions."}
{"text":"\n\nHedging our bets: the expected contribution of species to future phylogenetic diversity\n\n  Islands carry a disproportionately high number of unique species, but they are also more susceptible to extinction. Hence, the unique species found on islands are frequently used as examples of 'endangered' species. However, few studies have investigated the contribution of islands to the generation of future phylogenetic diversity, a measure of the number of unique evolutionary lineages. We show that islands are not only more important than expected in terms of their current phylogenetic diversity, but also in terms of their expected contribution to future phylogenetic diversity. We find that the current global diversity (the number of species) is 3.4 times higher on islands than on continents. This is mainly due to a greater number of monotypic families, indicating that islands are more important than expected in terms of the diversity they currently harbour. We also show that islands are more important than expected in terms of their expected contribution to future phylogenetic diversity. We estimate that islands will contribute 5.4 times more unique lineages to the global phylogenetic diversity than continents by the year 2100. The differences between the current and expected contributions are even higher for regional diversity, highlighting the importance of islands in generating future diversity, especially at a local scale. We attribute the higher diversity on islands to the tendency of species to evolve faster on islands, and to the higher speciation rates on islands. Our results suggest that species currently living on islands will play a crucial role in generating future phylogenetic diversity. Therefore, protecting the species found on islands is not only important in its own right, but will also have a disproportionately large effect on the future diversity of life on Earth."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a study of the 658 GHz water vapor masers in the Arp 220 jet with the Submillimeter Array (SMA). We have observed eight sources in the 12 \u00b4 12 \u00b4 12 degree 3 sky field, four of which are new discoveries. The most compact and brightest source, SSA 22, has a maser knot almost at the peak of the cold dark matter profile, which suggests that the gas density is extremely high. The other sources are distributed along the jet, with their masers located on the side of the dark matter peak, in a region of lower gas density. The high brightness of the SSA 22 maser, and the fact that it is so close to the center of the object, suggests that the maser pumping region is small, perhaps only a few tens of pc. We discuss this in the framework of a simple model in which the maser pumping region is at the center of a jet with a view angle a. We find that for a range of plausible values of a, the population in the maser pumping region is small, and thus the maser power is high. For very small values of a the population can be large and the maser power is low. We discuss the implications of this model for the understanding of the maser pumping mechanism."}
{"text":"\n\nMinimum Expected Distortion in Gaussian Layered Broadcast Coding with Successive Refinement\n\nWe consider the problem of Gaussian layered broadcast coding with successive\nrefinement (BLBCSR), which is the problem of communicating over a broadcast\nchannel with a finite number of identical receivers, while minimizing the expected\ndistortion per receiver. We show that, in contrast to the case with a Gaussian\nlayered channel, for which there exists a universal layering scheme that achieves\nthe minimum possible distortion, in the case of BLBCSR the minimum expected\ndistortion can only be achieved by using a scheme in which the number of layers\nis not greater than the number of receivers. We show that the number of layers\nis a strict inequality, rather than an equality, by deriving a new, tractable\nupper bound on the minimum expected distortion. The bound is achieved by\nusing a successive-refinement technique, in which one sends the first few\nlayers at the highest rate possible, and then gradually increases the number of\nlayers while decreasing the rate on each layer."}
{"text":"\n\nWe propose a unified description of the excited states of hadrons, based on the string theory description of the quark field. The quark fields are treated as a fermionic bag with a representation $\\Gamma^A_\\alpha$. We show that this description explains the hadron spectrum in a simple and transparent way, and the low energy behavior of the hadron Excited States Amplitude (ESA) can be obtained by a simple formula which is reminiscent of the QCD sum rule. The approach is general and can be applied to any hadron system, but we focus on the simplest case of an $s$-hadron with no excited quark. The general solution for the excited state amplitudes is derived, and the simplest non-vanishing contribution to the amplitudes is identified. This contribution is related to the operator $\\Gamma^\\ast_\\alpha \\Gamma^A_\\alpha$ which is the non-trivial symmetry generator of the quark fermionic algebra. The low energy limit of the excited state amplitudes is derived, and it is shown that the leading term in the expansion is proportional to the operator $\\Gamma^\\ast_\\alpha \\Gamma^A_\\alpha$. We also derive the general formula for the excited state amplitudes of an $s$-hadron with excited quarks. The approach is exact and no extra parameters are introduced. We also propose a description of the excited states of $d$-hadrons by using the $s$-hadron approach and the single index quark fields."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present scaling relations between X-ray and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) signals in galaxy clusters, based on a sample of clusters with known redshift, clustercentric distance, gas mass, and SZ flux. We show that the X-ray gas temperature and the SZ scale length are correlated, with the temperature scaling as the square of the scale length. The X-ray gas density and the SZ flux are also correlated, with the density scaling as the inverse square of the flux. We explain these scaling relations by a simple model in which the X-ray gas and the SZ gas are identical, with the X-ray gas at a higher temperature and lower density than the SZ gas. We show that the SZ scale length depends only on the total gas mass and the redshift, and is independent of the gas temperature and density. We use our scaling relations to predict the SZ scale length of a cluster with a given gas mass, and show that this prediction is in good agreement with the observed SZ scale length. We also show that the gas temperature and density are predicted by our scaling relations to have a wide range of values, depending on the cluster's properties."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate the production of charged weak gauge bosons (W, Z) and their neutral Higgs cousins (H) at the LHC. We focus on the case where the weak gauge bosons are produced in association with a Higgs boson. We show that, in the framework of a Standard Model (SM) inspired model with two generations of quarks and one of charged leptons, the flavor violating couplings of the Higgs boson to the weak gauge bosons can have a substantial effect on the production rates of the gauge bosons as well as on the production rate of a second Higgs boson. We evaluate the sensitivity of the LHC to the presence of such flavor violating couplings and find that it can already constrain some of the more extreme predictions made in the context of certain popular Grand Unified Theories. \n\nWe also investigate the production of a very light Higgs boson (mass comparable to the weak gauge bosons) and show that the associated production of weak gauge bosons can have a significant impact on the direct production cross section as well as on the production rate of a second Higgs boson. \n\nFinally, we consider the potential impact of the production of a heavy Higgs boson (mass comparable to the top quark) on the search for a Higgs sector with more than one Higgs boson.

{"text":"\nWe present high-resolution (D\/R > 1) spectroscopy and multiwavelength imaging of the shocked SiO microjet in the ionization structure of HH212. The observations were made with PdBI aboard the Herschel Space Telescope. We determine the three-dimensional velocity structure of the jet, which is travelling at ~45 km s-1, and show that the SiO maser line is formed in a shock at the ionization front. We also find that the jet is not collimated, despite the strong conservation of line-of-sight velocity, implying that it is not a classical synchrotron jet. Rather, the jet seems to be a bulk flow, possibly a fountain, with a large-scale structure and a low power-law velocity distribution with a slope of -1.3. The lack of collimation could be related to the fragmentation and rotation of the jet. We discuss these results in the context of a model in which the ionization structure is a gradually accelerating wind, which is eventually shocked by a strong ultraviolet source in the upper corona. Such a model could account for the lack of collimation, if the wind is somehow able to avoid the effects of the centrifugal force and maintain a bulk flow structure. We suggest that a fountain model, in which the gas is pulled away from the equatorial plane, could be a viable explanation."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a model for the mass loss from Luminous Blue Variables (LBVs) and the quasi-periodic modulations of Radio Supernovae (RSNe). The model is based on the assumption that the mass loss from LBVs and the accretion onto RSNs is driven by the same dynamical mechanism. The model also accounts for the evolution of the system's internal structure, in particular, the core-envelope system. We show that the mass-loss rate from LBVs is proportional to the shocked gas density, and the proportionality constant is given by the square of the frequency of the quasi-periodic modulation of RSNs. We evaluate the time-scales of the mass loss and the evolution of the core-envelope system. We show that the mass-loss rate is high at the early stage of evolution, but it is very low at the late stage of evolution. Therefore, the mass-loss rate is rather well controlled, and it is not likely that the massive gas ejection from LBVs causes the quasi-periodic modulations of RSNs. We discuss several possible physical mechanisms of the quasi-periodic modulations, and we show that a simple model of a single-frequency model can explain a wide range of observed properties of the quasi-periodic modulations."}
{"text":"\nWe present results of a systematic analysis of the distribution of ionized gas in the winds of WR stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Our goal is to use this data set to constrain theories of massive star formation by examining the relative contribution of different physical models to the observed wind geometries. We find that the observed correlation between stellar mass and wind ionization fraction is consistent with a simple model in which ionization is determined by a combination of the stellar magnetic field and metallicity. We show that this correlation can be explained without requiring an exotic progenitor model, unless the stellar initial mass function (IMF) is highly negatively skewed. We find that a simple model in which massive stars are formed by the accretion of gas from a surrounding cloud, in the absence of any invoked magnetic fields or turbulent mixing, is able to produce a reasonable match to the observed distribution of ionized wind fractions. This model requires a highly negative IMF and produces a small population of massive stars with very large accretion rates. More generally, we show that the observed correlation between ionization fraction and stellar mass is consistent with a wide variety of progenitor models, provided that these models invoke a sufficient degree of mixing or blending in the gas infalling onto the star. We discuss our results in the context of massive star formation theory and recent observations of star formation in the Orion Nebula Cluster."}
{"text":"\n\nThe electronic structure of barium titanate has been investigated using density-functional theory. We have used the effective core potential (ECP) method, based on the density-functional theory (DFT), to calculate the ground state properties of barium titanate, in which the electronic correlation is described by the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) approach. The ground state properties of barium titanate have been calculated on a single-copy basis using the ECP-GGA-SC approach. The electronic correlation effects have been taken into account by means of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) and SOC. We have found that the atomic structures of barium titanate are stable at the DFT level, in agreement with the experimental observations. We have also investigated the effects of the Coulomb interaction on the electronic structure of barium titanate. We found that the inclusion of the Coulomb interaction in the framework of DFT results in the growth of the electronic gap in agreement with the experimental observations."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present hard X-ray observations of the nuclei of NGC 2992 and NGC 3081, two galaxies in which powerful supernovae (SNe) have recently occurred. The aim of the observations is to study the X-ray properties of these galaxies in order to constrain the physical conditions in the envelopes of the SNe and in the surrounding medium. We find that the X-ray luminosity of NGC 2992 is 5 \u00d7 1036 erg s\u22121 in the 1 keV to 2 keV energy band, and that it decreases by a factor of three when the energy is increased to 5 keV.

The X-ray source is well described by a power law with a photon index of \u0393 = 2.0 \u00b1 0.3.

{"text":"\n\nThe Aqueous and Crystalline Forms of L-Alanine Zwitterion\n\nWe have determined the crystalline structure of the zwitterionic form of L-alanine, in a ternary mixture of water, methanol and acetonitrile, by single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. The crystal structure is stabilized by a hydrogen bond between the carbonyl oxygen of the zwitterionic form and the amine nitrogen of another molecule. In the crystal, the zwitterionic form is present in a ratio of approximately 3:1 to the non-zwitterionic form. The structure of the zwitterionic form in the crystal is very similar to that in the solution, except that it is further stabilized by a hydrogen bond. We have also determined the structure of the aqueous form in the presence of 2-propanol or ethylene glycol by analysis of the powder X-ray diffraction pattern. In the crystal, the zwitterionic form is present in a ratio of approximately 4:1 to the non-zwitterionic form. The crystal structure is stabilized by a hydrogen bond between the carbonyl oxygen of the zwitterionic form and the oxygen or the sulfur of another molecule.

{"text":"\n\nWe present a microscopic Monte Carlo approach to surface chemistry suitable for application to cold interstellar cloud cores. The method is based on a random walk algorithm and accounts for both gas-grain and grain-grain chemistry. We consider a simplified chemical system consisting of only a few elements and focus on the competition between the various chemical processes as the most important quantity to describe. The model is compared to previous models based on a statistical equilibrium approach and the different methods are compared in a simplified one-dimensional scenario. We find that the relative importance of the different chemical processes is correctly reproduced by our microscopic approach, provided that the initial conditions are chosen such that a chemical equilibrium is indeed obtained. The main difference between the statistical and the microscopic approach is that the latter takes into account the actual reaction probabilities, whereas the former uses only equilibrium constants. The good agreement between theory and observation for the simple chemical system considered suggests that a microscopic approach is indeed appropriate to describe surface chemistry in cold cloud cores, provided that the chemistry is not too complex."}
{"text":"\n\nChemical Properties of Star Forming Dwarf Galaxies\n\nWe present a chemical analysis of a sample of 45 nearby star forming dwarf galaxies selected from the list of galaxies in the Caltech-Tololo Southern Observatory (CTSO) survey, and compare the results with chemical properties of the Milky Way and the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds. The dwarf galaxies show a large variety in the chemical properties, with metallicities between 12 and 17 solar masses, and a correlation between metallicity and the gas content of the galaxies. The abundance ratios of alpha-elements and iron are in general agreement with the standard r-process and s-process models, but several of the galaxies show abundance ratios which require more than one r-process element, possibly representing a recent r-process event in the galaxy. The gas kinematics in the galaxies show that the chemical properties are probably not inherited from the galaxy formation process, but are mainly due to in-situ chemical evolution. Our results suggest that chemical evolution is not a slow and continuous process, but can be highly non-linear and dependent on the history of the galaxy. The observed chemical properties can in most cases be explained by relatively simple chemical evolution models including several r-process events. The estimated cluster metallicities are in good agreement with the observed chemical properties, suggesting that the chemical evolution of these galaxies has been mainly influenced by the environment."}
{"text":"\nWe introduce a simple dynamical model of a discrete web, in which the nodes represent resources and the edges represent the citations between them. This model is based on the assumption that the probability of a resource being cited is dependent only on the number of its previous citations, and not on the identity of the citing resources. We show that such a web can be supported by a small number of principles, and that its evolution is very similar to that of a continuous web. We analyse the conditions under which the discrete web can be considered to be scale-free and small-world, and we show that it is possible to take the dynamical system far from equilibrium. In particular, we find that a small number of resources can support a large number of citations, which leads to a heavy tail on the distribution of the number of citations received by the resources. We also show that the addition of a small number of extra principles can produce a rich set of behaviour, including self-sustained criticality. We discuss the implications of this work for the understanding of the dynamics of the World Wide Web."}
{"text":"\n\nWe investigate the possibility of a non-Abelian spin-string interaction in QCD strings. We show that such an interaction would be consistent with the string equation of motion, and with the non-Abelian statistics of quarks. We analyze the simplest case of a pure gauge string, in which the only dynamic degrees of freedom are the three spins of the quarks. For a pure spin-1\/2 string the quark charged currents can be related to the non-Abelian twists of the string, in the same way as the magnetic flux is related to the twist of a magnetic field line. We also find that the string tension can be related to the non-Abelian braiding statistics of the quarks. In a pure spin-1\/2 string the quarks can be related to the different ways the string can be braided. We show that this relation is more complicated in a mixed spin-1\/2-spin-1 string, in which the quarks can be related to the different ways the string can be braided, in the same way as the charged currents can be related to the twists of a pure spin-1\/2 string. We discuss the possible dynamics of a mixed spin-1\/2-spin-1 string."}
{"text":"\nWe consider the influence of various kinds of disordered structures on the formation of gyration-like excitations in solid solutions. Our analysis is based on the assumption that the interaction between different kinds of disordered structures is similar to the one between different molecules of the same kind. Two different approaches to the problem are considered: an exact approach, based on the use of the fs(R)Green function, and an approximate approach, based on the use of the molecular field theory. In both approaches the interaction between disordered structures is described by the same functional. In the case of the exact approach this functional is a kernel of the form Meixner-Sattached function, in the case of the approximate approach it is a sum of the Meixner-Sattached functions. As an example we consider the interaction between different kinds of rotations, both in the case of a single type of molecule and in the case of different types of molecules. In both cases we obtain a good description of the interaction in the case when the type of rotation is the same (the molecular case) and a bad description (the disordered case). In the molecular case the functional has a simple form, which is similar to the one obtained in the disordered case. In the disordered case the functional has a more complicated form and the structure of the disordered ground state is different from the one in the molecular case."}

{"text":"\nWe continue our investigation of the white dwarf luminosity function by examining the effects of measurement errors and biases. We find that errors in the observed spectral type of white dwarfs can produce a substantial bias in the measured luminosity function. This is particularly true for the faint end of the luminosity function where the flux is more sensitive to the white dwarf effective temperature. We consider two different methods of reducing the effect of the spectral type errors. In the first method we use a correction factor based on the difference between the observed spectral type and the true spectral type as determined from the absolute magnitude. In the second method we use the ratio of the fluxes in two different bands to remove the effect of the spectral type. We show that both methods give a better determination of the true luminosity function. We also consider the effect of other measurement biases, such as extinction, air mass, and seeing. We show that these can produce an artificial peak in the luminosity function at a white dwarf magnitude of -0.4. We recommend that future photometric observations of white dwarfs be made with a narrow band filter centered on the hydrogen-alpha wavelength to minimize the effect of measurement biases."}
{"text":"\nWe study spherically symmetric spacetimes in f(R) gravity theories. We find that a generic feature of these theories is the existence of a class of exact solutions which we call `` onboarding solutions''. Onboarding solutions can be obtained by adding a cosmological constant to a particular type of solution in the stress-energy tensor, known as the pure radiation solution. We show that this addition does not alter the staticity or sphericity of the solution. We then study the dependence of the onboarding solutions on the choice of the function f and the parameters in f. We find that for `` reasonable '' choices of f, the onboarding solutions have very special properties. In particular we show that (i) the acceleration of the analogous matter solutions is equal to the cosmological constant, (ii) the total energy of the system is always positive and (iii) the solutions are either static or Expanding. We also derive a general formula for the acceleration of the onboarding solutions which applies to all reasonable choices of f."}
{"text":"\nWe consider the global structure and the physical interpretation of the Fonarev solution for a scalar field with exponential potential. The motivation for the research is to understand the structure of the solution and the conditions under which it is valid.

The results obtained are that the Fonarev solution is a particular solution of the field equations with a certain potential function and that it is valid for a specific class of potentials. The problem this work attempts to solve is to find a physical interpretation for the Fonarev solution and to determine the conditions under which it is valid. The practical applications of this work are in the field of quantum mechanics, where the Fonarev solution is used to model a system with a potential that is singular in the space around the equilibrium position.

We found that the intensities of the satellite peaks in the EL spectra increased as x increased, and the main peak in the EL spectra blue-shifted as P decreased. For the transport measurements, we used an Au electrode as a top contact, and observed the capacitance-voltage (C-V) and current-voltage (I-V) characteristics. We found that the capacitance decreased as x increased, and the conductance increased as P decreased. The ideality factors of the C-V characteristics were greater than one, and the I-V characteristics showed non- ohmic behavior. We also found that the current density was higher when x was greater and P was smaller. These results were explained by considering the structural and optical properties of the SLs."}

The source was observed for 12 ks at a median energy of 17 keV, and a total exposure of ~16 ks was obtained in the subsequent observations in the Large Area Mode at a median energy of 2 keV. We find a 1-\u03c3 count difference of 7.8 kcps between the two observations, which corresponds to a 1-\u03c3 absorbed flux difference of 4.3% (for an assumed distance of 4.5 kpc). We discuss the nature of the transient, and find that the observations are consistent with a single burst. We determine a fluence of 6.6 kJ\/m2 in the energy range 2-16 keV, and a fluence in the 2-8 keV band of 4.9 kJ\/m2. This implies a fluence uncertainty of 15% (for an assumed distance of 4.5 kpc), and a fluence in the 2-8 keV band with an uncertainty of 12%. The source is located in a moderately dust-obscured region of the Galaxy. We find no evidence for a persistent source, and we set an upper limit on the fluence in the 2-8 keV band of J11321-5311 of 1.5 kJ\/m2 (for an assumed distance of 4.5 kpc) if the transient is caused by a repetitive process with a duration of 5 ks."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a systematic study of the spin-wave spectrum in a single crystal of underdoped YBa2Cu3O6.35 by means of broadband dielectric spectroscopy over a wide temperature range. Our results show a clear signature of the presence of a pseudogap in the underdoped cuprate, with a substantial drop in the dielectric constant and the spin-wave spectral weight in the pseudogap temperature region. Most interestingly, we find a strong evidence for the existence of a new kind of spin-wave excitations in the underdoped cuprate, which we call 'Cooper-spin waves'. These excitations are distinct from the standard spin-waves and the excitation energy is much higher than the typical spin-wave energy. Our observations suggest that the Cooper-spin waves may be related to the instability of the spin-wave excitations in the underdoped cuprate, and may be a signature of the presence of a strong repulsive interaction between the spin-waves and the charge carriers in the pseudogap phase. \n\nOur results may have important implications for the understanding of the nature of the pseudogap phase and the mechanism of superconductivity in the underdoped cuprates."}

We assume that the dielectric cylinder is located in a uniform external electric field, the lines of force of which are parallel to the symmetry axis of the cylinder. We find the optimal stabilisation angle of the dielectric cylinder, i.e. the angle between the dielectric axis and the direction of the external electric field, at which the disestablishment of the dielectric field inside the cylinder is completely stabilised. The optimal stabilisation angle does not depend on the ratio of the dielectric constants of the cylinder and the external medium. Our analytical expression for the optimal stabilisation angle is valid for an infinite variety of dielectric cylinders and homogeneous external media. We discuss our results in the framework of the microscopic Maxwell-Chern-Weiss theory."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a study of the bipolar nebula IRAS 19312+1950, which is the product of the latest stellar evolution of the ONeMg WD 50ql. This object has been the subject of much attention because of its very low temperature, its large mass-loss rate, and its potential to provide clues about the accretion history of magnetic white dwarfs. We present new near-infrared polarimetric images, which we have combined with previous data to produce a more complete map of the emission-line region. These data show a strong indication of circumstellar polarization, which we attribute to theollapse of the magnetic white dwarf. The white dwarf's magnetic field is able to extract rotational energy from the gas, producing a torque that brakes the accretion. This leads to a less violent accretion history and, consequently, to a lower mass-loss rate than would be expected from an unrestrained accretion flow. We show that this braking torque has decreased since the last outburst, probably because the white dwarf's magnetic field has become more distant from the accretion flow. We discuss this mechanism in the framework of the magnetic braking model."}
{"text":"\nWe have performed a systematic angle-resolved photoemission study of the two-dimensional electron system of the heavy-fermion superconductor CeCoIn_5 to investigate the relation between superconductivity and the pseudogap state. In particular, we have addressed the question of whether the biordered superconducting state that recently has been proposed for this material can coexist with a strong pseudogap state. Our results show that a biordered superconducting state cannot exist in the same crystal as a strong pseudogap state. Instead, a weakly-ordered superconducting state exists in this material, which has a much stronger tendency to form a non-superconducting state with a strong pseudogap. This tendency is so strong that a non-superconducting state with a strong pseudogap is formed from a weakly-ordered superconducting state by application of a relatively small magnetic field, and this non-superconducting state is stable against increasing the magnetic field back to zero. We also found that a non-superconducting state with a weak pseudogap can be induced from a non-superconducting state with a strong pseudogap by applying a relatively small magnetic field, and this non-superconducting state is stable against decreasing the magnetic field back to zero. Our results suggest that the biordered superconducting state in CeCoIn_5 is stabilized by an instability of the strong pseudogap state against the formation of a weakly-ordered superconducting state."}
{"text":"\n\nWe show that the Pioneer anomaly and the accelerating universe can be considered as effects of the Minkowski space conformal symmetry. The relativistic corrections to the predicted Galileo acceleration can be obtained from the 4-acceleration and the scalar curvature, in the presence of a small constant acceleration applied to the spaceship. The corrected acceleration shows a linear rise with the distance, reaching the cosmological constant value at large distances. The model is consistent with the observed Pioneer anomaly and with the standard cosmological model, within the precision of the experimental data. We also derive a simple formula for the correction to the acceleration, in terms of the proper time and the distance. The conformal symmetry of the Minkowski space also affects the gravitational field. If the source of the field is moving in a curved space, the field is also curved, in a different way for each of the two possible signs of the scalar curvature. We show that this effect may have interesting applications in quantum gravity."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a three-dimensional (3D) study of the circumbinari ring of the GG Tau system, a wide binary containing a magnetic white dwarf and a low-mass star. We combine images from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) with a new method for extracting the 3D structure of rings from single images. We show that the GG Tau ring is stratified, with the inner surface significantly more opaque than the outer one. The 3D structure has a pronounced depression at the inner edge, which is possibly due to the inner boundary layer seen on the surface. We discuss different mechanisms that might have formed such a structured ring, including the 3D structure of the initial dust cloud, the conservation of angular momentum, and the influence of the white dwarf's magnetic field. We also find a high correlation between the optical and the infrared luminosity of the ring, which implies that the dust is homogeneously distributed in the volume and that the observed ring structure is due to the different properties (absorption and emission) of the dust particles. Our findings suggest that the dust is either distributed in different sized grains or that it has been processed differently in different parts of the ring. We discuss the implications of our results for the structure and evolution of circumbinari rings."}
{"text":"\nWe study the statistical properties of droplets in the 2d +-J spin glass by means of numerical simulations. We find a good agreement with the mean-field theory for the droplet size distribution, in spite of the fact that the number of droplets is very large. For the droplet spin correlation function we find a significant difference from the mean-field theory, which can be understood from the fact that the correlation length is very large compared to the droplet size. We also find that the droplets are not universality, in the sense that their properties are significantly affected by the particular history of the spin glass. For example, the droplets are much more disordered in the case the spin glass is obtained by slow cooling from the isotropic phase, compared to the case the spin glass is obtained by fast cooling from the anisotropic phase. We also found a strong dependence on the initial conditions for the droplets. Our results are consistent with the picture that the droplets are arrested in a non-equilibrium state."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present simultaneous observations of the broad line radio galaxy 3C 382 with the Chandra X-ray Observatory and the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer. We find that the accretion phase of the blazar is much longer than previously estimated on the basis of optical observations, lasting at least 2.2 kyr. The observed phenomenology is consistent with a smoothly increasing flux triggered at random intervals with a distribution of phases in the binary system. We estimate the accretion rate to be  \u223c 10^( \u2212 2) M_(\u2299) yr^( \u2212 1) and the mass of the black hole to be  \u223c 6.6 kM_(\u2299). We conclude that the accretion phase of blazars is not constant, but rather it is modulated, possibly by the orbital period. We discuss several possibilities for the observed phenomenology, including a model in which the accretion rate is regulated by the orbital period, with many short orbital periods, but accretion episodes of constant duration. The accretion phase may thus be understood as a superposition of many shorter periods, with each period being individually stable."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present the results of three years of photometric monitoring of the Mira variables with the HST\/WFPC2, with a particular focus on the evolution of the accretion phases. We find that accretion episodes of different stars do not have the same duration and that the times when these episodes occur are not exactly periodic, although their length and their occurrence show some degree of periodicity. These results are consistent with a model in which the accretion episodes are triggered by the tidal interaction of the secondary star with the primary, and in which the actual occurrence of accretion episodes is randomly perturbed around a period. We find that the accretion phases can be further divided in two different subphases, which have different durations for each star. We have determined a robust period for the six brighter Mira variables in our sample, and find that the length of the accretion episode is in rough proportion with the period, with a correlation coefficient of 0.91. Our data also reveal that the accretion phases of different stars are not simultaneous, and that they are not exactly symmetric about the mean orbital period. We find that the distribution of the length of the accretion episodes is bimodal, with the bulk of the episodes being of intermediate duration, and that the long and short episodes occur with significantly different probabilities. The Mira variables appear to be in a transition between two different regimes, which have different properties. Our observations are consistent with a model in which the accretion episode is a random process, with the length of the episodes following an exponential distribution, and with the mean length being in proportion with the period. We discuss the implication of our results for the different models proposed to explain the observed accretion episodes."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a comparison of the quark and gluon fragmentation processes at sqrt{s}=10 GeV, using the recently published fixed-target data sets from the CDF and D0 experiments. The data sets include hundreds of millions of hadron collisions, and the analysis uses the distribution of particle production in the final state, in a framework that is free from any extra assumptions about the dynamics of the fragmentation process. We find that the quark and gluon fragmentation distributions are strikingly similar, in a way that is consistent with a picture where the underlying fragmentation dynamics is largely unchanged by the strong-color dynamics. This conclusion is supported by a detailed comparison of the predictions of a number of different models, using the same framework for the analysis. We also compare the distribution of particles produced in the fragmentation process to the predictions of a simple model based on the jet production cross section, and find a reasonable agreement. The analysis technique developed here can be used to study the particle production in other hadron collisions, and we discuss a number of interesting applications."}
{"text":"\nWe present a multiwavelength study of the jet-like outflow toward the high-mass (Proto)stellar Object 18566+0408. Our observations include Herschel\/PACS, as part of the Hi-GAL program, near-infrared imaging from VISIR and VLT\/MUSE, and radio data from the VLBA. The jet exhibits a steady glow at PACS wavelengths, but with a significant contribution to the flux from a compact, high-emission core. The core is resolved at VISIR and MUSE wavelengths, revealing a symmetric, hourglass-like structure, possibly similar to the molecular outflows previously observed in low-mass star-forming regions. We find that the jet's mass-flow rate is only 0.01 M yr-1, about two orders of magnitude smaller than the stellar mass loss rate of the central object. The core's emission peaks at a few arcseconds away from the optical\/NIR source, at the position of the radio source, suggesting that the jet is probably a slow-moving, hourglass-shaped one, not a bullet-shaped one. Our results therefore suggest that the high-mass object is probably not the source of the jet. The most plausible hypothesis is that a hidden low-mass object, possibly a disk, is the source of the jet."}
{"text":"\n\nRandom Access Broadcast: Stability and Throughput Analysis\n\nWe consider a single-server random access broadcast channel with error-free feedback. The server sends independent identical copies of a fixed size message to the receivers, who feed back requests for additional copies of the message until they have received the number of copies they want. The server can send these additional copies interleaved with the initial copies, or in a separate batch after the initial copies have been sent. We show that the throughput of this random access broadcast channel is throughput of this random access broadcast channel is upper-bounded by a threshold that is a function of the total number of receivers and the size of the message, and does not depend on the way the additional copies are sent. We show that this threshold is tight for a large class of such channels. We also consider the stability of this random access broadcast channel, and show that the servers stable set is equal to the set of all receivers that have requested zero copies of the message. We show that this random access broadcast channel is stable if the size of the message is larger than a threshold that is a function of the total number of receivers. We consider a natural generalization of this random access broadcast channel to the case where the receivers can request different numbers of copies of the message, and show that the threshold for this generalization is a function of the maximum number of copies requested by any of the receivers."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present observations of the supernova (SN) 1987A shock wave as it passes through the old supernova remnant 3C 58. We find a large, well-defined peak in the shocked gas at the same distance from the SN 1987A as the peak in the sound wave, but six times farther away than the peak in the temperature distribution. This shock-wave peak contains 0.4 kpc^2 of the total 1.4 kpc^2 of gas that is shocked by the passage of the supernova blast wave. We interpret this shock structure as a bubble, with the gas inside the bubble being excited by the shock wave and the gas outside the bubble being depressed by the shock wave. We show that such a bubble configuration is consistent with the observed density and temperature distribution. We estimate that the mass of the gas inside the bubble is M_{gas} \u223c 2 \u00d7 10^{33} M\u2299, which is \u223c 1% of the total SN 1987A mass. The mass of gas in the bubble is much less than the total mass of gas in the remnant, which is M_{gas} \u223c 7 \u00d7 10^{33} M\u2299. We conclude that most of the gas in the 3C 58 remnant was lost before the SN 1987A shock wave reached the remnant."}
{"text":"\n\nEnhanced activity of massive black holes by stellar capture assisted by a self-gravitating accretion disc\n\nWe investigate the conditions for the formation of a self-gravitating accretion disc around a massive black hole, and the impact of such a disc on the accretion and feedback processes. We find that a self-gravitating accretion disc is only dynamically stable if the black hole spin is close to the threshold for the formation of a magnetic accretion disc. We show that such a massive black hole with a self-gravitating accretion disc is able to grow much faster by capturing stars than a massive black hole without a disc. The captured stars are accreted at a rate that is proportional to the star's orbital frequency, and the feedback from the accretion disc is able to increase the rate of star capture. We show that this feedback process is stable if the accretion disc is massive enough, and the star capture rate is sufficiently large. We also find that the accretion disc is able to disrupt the capture of stars if the accretion disc is not massive enough. This happens if the star capture rate is too large, or if the accretion disc is able to accrete matter at a rate that is larger than the rate at which stars are captured. We discuss the implications of our results for the possible formation and evolution of massive black holes, and for the interpretation of observational data."}
{"text":"\nWe discuss the implications of \"peak oil\" for atmospheric CO2 and climate, focusing on the question of when global oil production will peak, and the potential impacts of a peak on CO2 emissions. We consider three different assumptions about the potential for the development of alternative energy sources, and three different assumptions about the likely maximum rate at which oil production can be reduced. We find that under most assumptions, a peak in oil production will lead to an increase in atmospheric CO2, at least in the short term, because there is no ready substitute for oil in the global energy supply. The one exception is if oil production peaks and the maximum rate of decline is very large, and there is a ready substitute that can be implemented quickly enough to offset the decline in oil production. We also find that the peak in oil production occurs earlier, as a percentage of the total time since the Industrial Revolution, under the assumption that there is no ready substitute for oil, compared to the assumption that there is a ready substitute. The percentage of the total time since the Industrial Revolution when global oil production peaks ranges from about 40% to about 60% under the different assumptions we consider. The practical implications of these results are that the world may have less time to develop alternatives to oil than previously thought."}
{"text":"\nWe have developed a new algorithm for finding the precise nonlinear evolution of the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) scale in a universe that has been approximated by a Friedmann-Roberson-Walker cosmology with both a variable equation of state (EOF) parameter $w(a)$ and a variable cosmological constant $\\Lambda(a)$, where $a$ is the scale factor. Our new algorithm is based on the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) technique and the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm. This new algorithm provides a more efficient and more precise way of finding the BAO scale evolution in the presence of both a variable EOF and a variable cosmological constant. In particular, our algorithm can find the BAO scale evolution at any redshift with a computational cost that is $\\mathcal{O}(\\log n)$, where $n$ is the number of input data points. Our new algorithm has been validated by comparing its results with those obtained using the conventional method based on the least squares technique.

{"text":"\n\nExploring Continuous Tensegrities\n\nWe introduce a new class of continuous tensegrities, or continuous tensional structures, which are a combination of tensegrity structures and deformable continua. We show that a continuous tensegrity can be modeled as a spanning tree that contracts and extends along its branches. This contraction and extension behave like a series of statically-loaded springs and are controlled by a set of non-positive boolean variables. By using the theory of linear differential equations, we are able to analyze the behavior of this class of continuous tensegrities. We prove the existence of a unique solution to this class of differential equations and we characterise the shape of this solution through the use of a reducing equation. We explore several examples of continuous tensegrities and we discuss the conditions that guarantee the stability of a solution. Finally, we show how to discretize a continuous tensegrity in order to obtain a new class of discrete tensegrities."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a formalism for the deterministic characterization of stochastic genetic circuits. We define a stochastic protocol using only Markovian logic and elementary stochastic operations. This protocol characterizes the probabilistic behavior of genetic circuits in terms of logic-based description. The protocol is based on the identification of a suitable class of Genetic Grammars that is able to express any stochastic genetic circuit. The class is defined by extending the Genetic Algorithm in a way that allows to combine Markovian logic with stochastic operations. The characterization is achieved by means of an interpreter that takes as input a Genetic Grammar and outputs the corresponding stochastic protocol. We show how to use the interpreter to perform a formal verification of the dynamics of a genetic circuit against a specification in the form of a stochastic protocol. As an example, we apply our framework to the characterization of a stochastic genetic circuit that is involved in the evolution of modularity in bacterial gene expression."}
{"text":"\n\nWe study the structure and evolution of large blog graphs. We find that the vast majority of blogs in a large blog graph are almost completely isolated from one another, each with very few connections to the rest of the graph. We also find that the number of connected components is very large, with a few very large components and many small ones. We show that this is in sharp contrast to the small-world behavior that is exhibited by many other large graphs, such as the collaboration graphs of scientists and the call graphs of phone networks. We find that the large number of small components is due to the fact that most blogs in the graph have very few incoming links, and are thus isolated from most of the rest of the graph. The few large components are made up of blogs that have many incoming links, and thus are connected to many other blogs. We also show that the small components are highly connected internally, and are thus small-world graphs in their own right. We discuss the implications of this finding for the evolution of large blog graphs, and for the dynamical processes that take place on them."}

{"text":"\n\nCompact Starburst in the Central Regions of Seyfert Galaxies\n\nWe present a comprehensive study of the central starburst regions in Seyfert galaxies. We combine ultraviolet through infrared photometry and spectroscopy of the ionized gas in the centers of a sample of 68 galaxies selected from the largest available optically-selected sample of Seyfert galaxies, and for which high-resolution images are available. We find that a significant fraction of Seyfert galaxies contain a compact starburst component in their nuclei. The ionized gas in these starburst regions is detected in 31 galaxies in our sample, which represents about 45% of the total. The ionized gas in the central regions is always at a higher temperature than the surrounding galaxy, and is more often excited by aWolf-Rayet star than by an AGN. In the starburst region, the ionized gas distribution is relatively free of large-scale structure. The gas kinematics and ionization structure indicate that the ionized gas in the central regions is likely to have been accreted recently. We also determine the physical properties of the stellar populations in the central regions of our sample. We find that the stars in the central regions have higher metallicities and are younger than the stars in the outer parts of the galaxies. In addition, the color and magnitude distribution of the stars in the central regions are consistent with the presence of a black hole in the center of the galaxy. We discuss the origin and evolution of the compact starburst phenomenon in Seyfert galaxies. We find that a massive and dynamically important starburst is not inconsistent with the presence of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) in the same galaxy, and that the starburst phenomenon may provide a natural explanation for the observed correlation between the mass of the black hole and the properties of the host galaxy."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present the results of a large-scale analysis of the topology of the hot intergalactic medium (HIG) in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) based on the temperature-sensitive dust emission at 850 \u03bcm.

The spatial distribution of the surface density of the dust emission is found to exhibit a power law decay with the distance to the galactic center. We show this power law decay to be consistent with aCosmological model in which the Hot Intergalactic Medium (HIM) is treated as a cosmological fluid with a exponential increase in temperature with radius. We discuss this model in the context of a collisionless wind model which has been invoked to explain the origin of the hot gas in galaxies.

{"text":"\nWe present QED calculations of the 2p1\/2-2s and 2p3\/2-2s transition energies and the ground-state hyperfine splitting in lithiumlike scandium. The QED approach used here is based on the exact solution of the Bethe-Weizsacker equation for a many-body system with a single-particle basis. The contributions to the hyperfine splitting from the single-particle basis and from the many-body basis are evaluated separately. The 2p1\/2-2s transition energy is found to be larger than the 2p3\/2-2s transition energy by about 3.7 MeV. This difference is due to the large relativistic contraction of the 2s orbital, which leads to a large overlap between the 2s and 2p1\/2 orbitals. The 2p3\/2-2s transition energy is smaller than the 2p1\/2-2s transition energy because the 3\/2-state has a larger kinetic energy than the 1\/2-state. The ground-state hyperfine splitting is also evaluated and found to be in agreement with previous QED calculations and with the result of a recent relativistic molecular dynamics calculation."}

We find that the local galaxies in our sample are in general less massive, less gas-rich, and contain fewer stars than the distant galaxies. We show that this difference is correlated with the galaxies' star formation rates, with the local galaxies having on average lower star formation rates than the distant galaxies. We also find that the strength of the metal lines in the local galaxies is on average higher than in the distant galaxies, suggesting that the local galaxies are more efficient at creating metals. Our results suggest that the local galaxies in our sample have evolved to become more efficient at converting gas to stars and metals.

We also present several topology generation rules inspired by natural systems such as the Internet and the brain, which can be used to generate large-scale NoC interconnect topologies. We present simulation results to show the impact of the scale-free nature of our proposed model on the fault tolerance of the system."}
{"text":"\nThe generator coordinate method in time-dependent density-functional theory: memory made simple\n\nWe present a simple method to evaluate the exact eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the spatial Laplace operator in a time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT) calculation. The method, which we dub the generator coordinate method, is based on a formal similarity transformation of the time-dependent Kohn-Rostoker Green function (TDKGF) which yields a matrix representation of the Laplace operator in the basis of the coherent states of the TDKGF. The use of the generator coordinate method allows one to solve the eigenvalue and eigenvector problems in TDDFT calculations exactly, without the need for the introduction of any additional memory variables. We show that the method can be applied to both time-independent and time-dependent systems, and we present a thorough analysis of its application to a class of time-dependent systems for which the solution of the eigenvalue and eigenvector problems is particularly difficult."}
{"text":"\nWe present a unified theory of light interactions with matter that successfully predicts the behavior of two-photon interactions with broadband down-converted light, squeezed light, and entangled photons. Our theory combines the well-known macroscopic equations of electromagnetic theory with a microscopic many-body theory of light-matter interactions that is based on the concept of virtual photons. The virtual photons are associated with the excited states of the atoms and molecules in the nonlinear optical media. We show that the theory can be used to explain a number of interesting phenomena, such as the spatial and temporal focusing of light, the effects of light upon different types of atoms and molecules, and the dynamics of photon pairs produced by parametric fluorescence in a nonlinear optical medium. The theory can be used to design new types of optical filters and to optimize the efficiency of parametric processes. It can also be used to predict new effects that are due to the correlated nature of light in the presence of macroscopic fields."}
{"text":"\n\nCryptoplanet update\nThis work presents an update to our previous work on cryptoplanets. In this work, we present a detailed analysis of the astrometric data for the Kepler-107 system. We find that the system contains two planets, one with a mass close to that of the Earth. This is the second system found by the Kepler Mission that contains a rocky planet in the habitable zone. We also present a new method to constrain the thickness of the atmosphere of Kepler planets. The method is based on a combination of atmospheric modeling and an analysis of the diffraction patterns produced by the atmospheres of transiting planets. With this method we constrain the atmospheric thickness of the two large gas giants in the Kepler-107 system. We find that the atmosphere of the larger planet is optically thick, while the atmosphere of the smaller planet is likely to be thinner. We also present an update to our method to determine the true size of giant planets using a combination of photometric and spectroscopic observations. We apply this method to the gas giants in the Kepler-107 system."}
{"text":"\nWe consider the problem of constructing a symmetric, second-order, hyperbolic-parabolic system which is axially symmetric about the coordinate axis and which has a cosmological constant to generate a formulation of general relativity theory which is free from the time-space ambiguity inherent in the original theory. The result is a system of coupled equations consisting of a hyperbolic equation for the metric and a second-order parabolic equation for the scalar curvature. In this system, the space component of the curvature is time-space symmetric, while the time component has a negative sign. We show that this formulation has all the properties of general relativity except that it does not admit a symmetric, second-order, hyperbolic-parabolic formulation. We then show that by a change of variables this system can be brought into the symmetric, second-order, hyperbolic-parabolic form originally desired. This system has the desired space-time symmetry and the properties of general relativity, and therefore should be a more acceptable formulation of the theory."}
{"text":"\n\nWe have proposed and demonstrated a novel logic circuit configuration that utilizes a spin wave bus, which is capable of transferring and storing information simultaneously, to enable a high-speed logic circuit with a simple configuration.

The logic circuit is connected between the buses and performs logic operations using the spin information transferred through the buses. Since the spin information can be transferred and stored simultaneously, the proposed logic circuit can perform logic operations without using any clock, which enables high-speed operation. In addition, the proposed logic circuit can be configured with a simple connection of the buses and the logic circuit, which enables the circuit to be designed easily.

{"text":"\n\nHypervelocity stars (HVSs) are huge helium-rich evolved stars with substantial mass loss, large radii, and very high velocities, some of which are suspected to have been ejected from the centers of galactic nuclei. We present a theoretical investigation of the dynamical interactions between a single HVS and the interstellar medium in the neighborhood of a supermassive black hole (SMBH), such as the one at the center of our Galaxy. We find that the strong gravitational field of the SMBH has a profound effect on the motion of the HVS, potentially resulting in its accretion onto the SMBH. This conclusion is based on a systematic analysis of the motion of the HVS in the presence of a variety of different spatial distributions of matter in the interstellar medium. Our analysis shows that in order for the HVS to be accreted onto the SMBH, the SMBH must be a supercritical SMBH, i.e., a SMBH with a mass above the minimum mass for which a stable accretion disk can be supported. In addition, we show that a particular distribution of the interstellar medium, a so-called accretion funnel, can be a mechanism to extract the HVS from its orbit and to feed it onto the SMBH. Such accretion funnels can be formed in the process of gas and dust gravitational infall onto the SMBH, which then forms a rotating accretion disk around the SMBH. We discuss the relevance of our results for the low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) and for the galactic nuclei in general."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present observations of the transient source 4U 0115+63 from the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) and the INTEGRAL Observatory. We use the RXTE observations to construct a pulse profile, and we extract the cyclotron line from the INTEGRAL observation. The source is found to be a compact object with a power law spectrum and a radius of curvature of 1.6 kpc. The transient nature of the source is confirmed by the pulse profile, which shows a exponential decay in the power law index during the observed period. The cyclotron line is well described by a three-component model. The high energy component can be described by an adiabatic expansion model, while the low energy component is best described by a model with two temperature intervals. The broad line component is best described by a model with a large number of emitting regions at different temperatures and with different line-of-sight velocities. The high energy emitting region is probably accreting matter at a very high rate, and has a large number of electrons in the inner edge of the accretion disc. We estimate that the mass of the accreting object is 3-10 times the mass of the Sun. The low energy emitting region has a mass of order of one solar mass. We suggest that the broad line component may be due to a large number of low mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) in a wide orbit around the object, and that the high energy component may be due to the motion of the LMXBs as they orbit the massive object."}
{"text":"\n\nWe give a general method of constructing quantum field theories which have extra dimensions and a finite number of independent degrees of freedom, yet are dynamically generated and renormalizable. Such theories can be viewed as the Limit of a large number of quasi-dimensional degrees of freedom as the number of dimensions goes to infinity. As an example, we construct a model with four independent degrees of freedom which dynamically generates a four-dimensional Lorentzian manifold with a non-trivial, smooth structure, and is invariant under a four-dimensional rotation group. We show that such a theory can be constructed from a class of Fuzzy Extra Dimensions (FED) models which are derived from the symmetric and antisymmetric parts of a matrix-vector-valued FED potential. The symmetric part of the potential gives rise to a dynamically generated Lorentzian manifold, while the antisymmetric part provides the non-trivial structure. We show that the resulting theory is invariant under a four-dimensional rotation group, and thus the symmetry group of the theory is larger than the one for a dynamically generated Lorentzian theory with a trivial structure. The method is general and can be applied to an arbitrary number of independent degrees of freedom. We discuss the implications of our results for the construction of theories with a finite number of quasi-dimensional degrees of freedom, and for the notion of extra dimensions in general."}

{"text":"\n\nWe present 2MASS photometry of 66 bright active galactic nuclei (BALQSOs) with known redshifts in the range 1 < z < 3.5. The sample is selected from the 2MASS QSO survey with the purpose of investigating the evolution of the accretion history of these galaxies. We find that the intrinsic optical luminosity functions (OLFs) of the 66 BALQSOs are well described by a power law with a power of -1.92 \u00b1 0.05 and a scale of 2.36 \u00b1 0.08 Mpc, which is independent of redshift and the peak luminosity. The mean intrinsic brightness is 6.05 \u00b1 0.13 mag, and the intrinsic magnitude distribution is well described by a power law with a power of -1.28 \u00b1 0.05 and a scale of 1.61 \u00b1 0.07 mag. We conclude that the intrinsic OLFs of active galaxies are well described by a single power law, and that the intrinsic magnitude distribution of quasars is well described by two power laws.

{"text":"\n\nWe consider the question of controlling mechanical systems on Lie groups, focusing on the case of ideal hydrodynamics. We show that the traditional control methods of ideal hydrodynamics on the basis of the maximum principles can be naturally formulated on the space of symmetry groups. We propose a generalization of the standard control methods to the case of multi-parametric systems, when the system is represented in the symmetrical space by a linear combination of the elements of the symmetry group. Within this approach, the control problem is reduced to the optimization of a certain functional, which has the properties of a quadratic form. The optimization problem is shown to be equivalent to the solution of a certain partial differential equation. We analyze the properties of this equation and solve it analytically in the case of 2-parametric systems. We also discuss the question of the existence of a solution for the control problem and propose an algorithm for its numerical solution in the case of multi-parametric systems."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present the results of a multiwavelength ($u$, $v$, $b$, $y$) CCD photometry and membership segregation of the open cluster NGC2682 (M67). The photometry was performed with the Franciscomorales Telescope (FT) at thehora Yin noodle soup (YNS), and with the Yale-New Haven Hospital (YNH) reflector at Hippo's La Sierra Observatory (HSO), both in Spain. We use these data sets to search for member stars in the solar neighborhood. The aim of this work is to present a reliable and objective method to determine the membership in an open cluster, based on the difference of the photometric parameters between cluster members and field stars. We apply this method to the cluster NGC2682 (M67), because it contains a well-known member, namely HR8883 (the cluster's brightest star), and because it has been the subject of much previous photometric study. We show that this method is effective at selecting the cluster members, in agreement with the visual inspection. We also compare the results with those of previous studies, and we conclude that there are significant photometric differences between field stars and cluster members, even when the membership is determined visually. Our method is suitable for identifying members of open clusters with relatively small number of observations, as long as a well-known member star is present."}
{"text":"\n\nWe study the wetting transition on a one-dimensional disordered solid, which is parameterized by the fill fraction \u03d5 of the disordered sites. The wetting transition is associated with a crossover from a disordered to a highly ordered state as \u03d5 is increased. We find that the critical behavior of the wetting transition is very different for \u03d5 \u2265 \u03d5c (the crossover temperature) and \u03d5 < \u03d5c. In particular, the variance of the wetting transition temperature T (i.e. the standard deviation of T around its mean value) is found to be very large when \u03d5 < \u03d5c, and becomes almost zero as \u03d5 \u2265 \u03d5c. We also find that the variance of the wetting transition temperature has a power-law dependence on the variance of the underlying disordered lattice, and thus the variance of the wetting transition temperature can be controlled by varying the lattice variance. Our results suggest that the wetting transition on disordered solids is intrinsically different from the one on ordered solids, and thus the wetting transition on disordered solids can be controlled by varying the underlying lattice variance."}

We then present a simple model of biodiversity development that is based on species-area relationships and the competitive exclusion principle. Our model generates transient periodicity in biodiversity, which depends on the number and relative fitness of the resident species. We then show, based on a formalism for generating biodiversity, that a combination of rare, large-body and short-lived species and a combination of common, small-body and long-lived species can produce transient periodicity in biodiversity. We finally discuss the implications of transient periodicity for the problem of lacking periodicity in the fossil record and for the role of ecological factors in generating biodiversity."}
{"text":"\n\nEntangled games are hard to approximate.\nWe show that if the win probability of a game is strictly between 0 and 1 (as is the case for all entanglement games), then the game is hard to approximate. We consider three settings: games with a bounded number of rounds, games with an unbounded number of rounds, and the setting of correlated games (where one can play a correlated sequence of entanglement games). We show that not only are entanglement games hard to approximate in the sense that an approximate algorithm's win probability converges on the true win probability of the game at a sub-linear rate, but that this is the best possible rate (up to a constant).\n\nWe show that an approximate algorithm's number of queries to the entanglement game converges on the number of queries in the minimal basis for the number of rounds setting, and that the gap is (up to a constant) the number of queries in the minimal basis for the unbounded number of rounds setting. In other words, the number of queries is within a constant factor of the minimal basis number of queries, which is tight. We show that an approximate algorithm's number of queries to the entanglement game converges on the number of queries in the minimal basis for the correlated setting, and that the gap is (up to a constant) the number of queries in the minimal basis for the uncorrelated setting. In other words, the number of queries is within a constant factor of the minimal basis number of queries, which is tight.\n\nFinally, we consider the setting of convex entanglement games, and show that the worst case approximation algorithm's win probability converges on the true win probability at a sub-linear rate.

{"text":"\n\nWe present observations of transient radio emission from the pulsar PSRJ1713. We found that the pulsar's radio emission is irregular, with occasional brightenings that last a few hours to a few days, and a subsequent fading. The brightenings are clearly non-thermal in origin, with a fluence measured inpeta-Joules. They are associated with the appearance of radio belts, with a fluence 10,000 times that of the average radio emission, and a width of approximately 4 times the corresponding radii of the A1 and A2 belts. The transient brightenings are thought to be due to the injection of energy in the form of relativistic electrons into the pulsar's magnetic field by a companion star. The high fluence of the radio belts and the large numbers of discrete structures in them suggest that the energy is deposited in the pulsar's magnetosphere by Alfv\u00e9n waves, possibly triggered by interactions between the pulsar's magnetic field and the interstellar medium. We found that the radio emission is produced by a complex network of rather sharp resonance features, distributed over at least four shells, and with amplitudes increasing with distance from the pulsar. We propose that the resonance features are due to the coherent excitation of waves at the boundary between the hot plasma interior and the cold vacuum exterior of the magnetosphere, a boundary that is likely to be geometrically complicated by the presence of the stronger-than-average magnetic field and the large number of discrete features in the belts. The waves excited at this boundary are capable of exciting plasma oscillations at large distances from the boundary, in the cold vacuum exterior of the magnetosphere. Our findings suggest that the transient radio brightenings are associated with processes that are potentially common to many pulsars, and that they may be clues to the physical processes taking place in magnetospheres around many pulsars."}
{"text":"\nWe present the first three-dimensional measurement of the halo velocity anisotropy of the dark matter distribution in a large galaxy cluster, using data from the Dragonfly Telephoto Array. We find the anisotropy to be positive, consistent with the anisotropy being due to the thermally driven out-of-plane motion of the cluster galaxies. This measurement sets a new limit on the difference between the dark matter and baryonic contributions to the total cluster velocity anisotropy, at 2.5 standard deviations from the mean, or 2.7 times the theoretical prediction. We find that the main contribution to the anisotropy is from galaxies in the cluster core, which has a higher dark matter fraction than the rest of the cluster. We show this by fitting a cosine function to the anisotropy profile, with the best-fit parameters in good agreement with predictions from a simple model in which the anisotropy is due to thermally driven out-of-plane motion, with an additional contribution from the preference of dark matter to follow the galaxies in the core. Our measurement sets a limit on the degree to which dark matter and baryons can differ in their velocity anisotropy, and provides a benchmark for theoretical models that aim to explain the origin of the anisotropy in the velocity distribution of galaxies in clusters."}

{"text":"\nWe present a detailed study of the magnetic fields of 21 classical T Tauri stars, 14 of which are members of the TW Hydrae Association. Our observations are made with the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) at 1.3 GHz and resolve the stars' magnetospheres to an average spatial resolution of 30 Milliarcseconds. We find that the magnetic fields are directed radially inwards, are less than 10 MG, and have an average field strength of 6.2 MG. The field distribution is very non-uniform, with super-granulation (with sizes between 10 and 20 Mm) being the dominant feature. The fields show large-scale longitudinal and latitudinal structure, probably due to magneto-convection, and in several cases strong magnetic spots are present. We discuss our results in the framework of a simple model of magneto-convection in rotating stars, and present a physical interpretation of our observations. We find that the magnetic field generation is probably due to a combination of internal convection and a slow rotation rate, and that magneto-convection is an efficient mechanism for driving mass-loss from these stars."}

In this work, we investigate the failure mechanisms and surface roughness statistics of fractured Fontainebleau sandstone. We first present results of an experimental program conducted to investigate the effects of different loading modes and rates on the failure mechanisms. We then focus on the characterization of the surface of the failed samples. We analyze the spatial distribution of the roughness, in relation with the crack network. We show that the roughness is mainly concentrated in the proximity of the main cracks, and especially at the crack tips. We also quantify the spatial distribution of the roughness power law parameter and demonstrate that it follows a log-normal distribution, with a clear peak at the value typical of the failure roughness. Finally, we analyze the anisotropy of the roughness and show that it is mainly due to the anisotropy of the crack network, with the longest cracks having the highest roughness. This study contributes to better understanding the role of surface roughness on the behavior of fractured rocks, and particularly on the problem of loose rock slippage."}

The document is entitled \"Reflections on the Influence of Gymnastics on the Development of the Body and the Will.\" The student's name is \u00c9mile Cividale. The issue is the advisability of including in the School's curriculum a course in gymnastics.\n\nCamille Jordan is the guardian of the tradition of the \"old school,\" which holds that mathematics is a \"matter of intelligence\" and that gymnastics is a \"matter of will.\" In a draft of a letter to Cividale, Jordan writes: \"I see in it [i.e., in gymnastics] a waste of time, and even a danger for the health of our students.\" His preferred course of action is to \"condemn the practice of gymnastics in our school.\"\n\nIn contrast, Leopold Kronecker is a strong advocate of gymnastics. In his eyes, it is essential to the well-being of the students. In a draft of a letter to Cividale, Kronecker writes: \"I support the initiative of those who wish to teach gymnastics to our students, and I will do all in my power to see that this initiative bears fruit.\"\n\nThe debate goes on for several weeks. The two mathematicians exchange a stream of letters, each one answering the other's arguments. Their personalities clash. The issue becomes one of who is to prevail, Jordan or Kronecker. The outcome is that Kronecker prevails. Mathematics is not to be separated from gymnastics. The teaching of gymnastics is to be given a place in the School's curriculum."}
{"text":"\nWe present a pointing survey toward the central regions of starless cores in order to probe inward motions using the HCN J = 1-0 hyperfine transition. We use a simple model in which the distribution of HCN is treated as a isothermal, homogenous, and stationary gas in order to derive an expression for the observed distribution of HCN J = 1-0 intensity as a function of radius. We show that this expression can be used to infer the radial distribution of the column density, N(r), and the radial motion, v(r), provided that N(r) and v(r) are known at the inner and outer edges of the core. We present observations toward 46 starless cores in the Taurus-Auriga region. We find that the column density generally increases toward the core centers, consistent with gravitational collapse, except in 6 cases in which the column density is constant. We infer the radial distribution of v(r) in the same 46 cores and find that v(r) is constant in 20 cores, decreases in 8 cores, and increases in 6 cores. We conclude that a large fraction (70%) of the cores show no evidence of inward motions, consistent with the simple assumption of isothermal, homogenous, and stationary gas distribution. We discuss possible physical mechanisms that may produce the non-monotonic distributions of v(r) and N(r) found in some cores."}
{"text":"\nWe present an analysis of high-precision photometric and spectroscopic observations of the transiting extrasolar planet system TrES-2. We find that the system contains two giant planets with radii R \u22c5 m, and m. We also determine the density of both planets to be \u03c1 \u22c5 kg m\u22123. These parameters are consistent with a pure hydrogen atmosphere for both planets, which implies a significant improvement in the atmospheric model compared to previous estimates. We find that the giant planet with the longer orbital period also has a higher density, suggesting that it is composed of a higher fraction of rocky material. We show that both giant planets have significant atmospheric temperature differences between the lit and unlit sides, which implies a large heat capacity. This could be indicative of a significant magnetic field, although this would be in conflict with the low magnetic field strength measured for the host star. Alternatively, this could be due to the giants' large heat capacity, which may be a result of their high density and thus a significant fraction of rocky material. We discuss this system in the context of known transiting giant planets, and the implications for the measurement of the atmospheric and radiative properties of these systems."}

Our key idea is to use a simplified model that captures the essential features of the problem, in order to obtain general results that can be applied to real fluids. Our methodology is to perform a large number of numerical simulations, in which we vary the values of the dimensionless numbers in the model, and study the effect of these variations on the efficiency of the transport process. We obtained results showing that the efficiency of the transport process is very sensitive to the values of the dimensionless numbers in the model, and that the transport process can be significantly enhanced by tuning the values of these numbers. Our work suggests that dimensionless numbers may play a key role in determining the efficiency of MRI-induced turbulent transport in real fluids, and that it may be possible to significantly increase the efficiency of this process by tuning the values of the relevant dimensionless numbers in the fluid."}

CAST will use a new technique,precision optical axion cloaking, to measure the axion-photon coupling. The CAST optical design requires a large-area (50 cm x 50 cm) silicon pn-CCD detector to detect the small number of photons (8 per second) scattered by the cloaking reflector. The detector must have a very low dark current (1 particle per hour per pixel) to achieve the required statistical precision. We have designed and built a breadboard model of a pn-CCD that has a dark current of 0.6 particles per hour per pixel. In this paper, we present the results of a background study of the CAST pn-CCD detector. We find that the two main sources of background noise are (1) thermal noise from the readout electronics, and (2) dark current from the pn-CCD. We estimate the detectability threshold for CAST using (1) a detailed model of the thermal noise, and (2) measurements of the dark current in our breadboard model. We then present a detailed design for the CAST pn-CCD detector, including the opto-mechanical design and the electronics design."}
{"text":"\n\nWe propose a method to optimize the design of a galaxy survey to measure the dark energy density and test modified gravity models. We consider a linear combination of the density field and the scale factor as a proxy for the dark energy density and test the reliability of this metric to measure the dark energy density as a function of redshift with different galaxy survey strategies. We find that the galaxy number density evolution is a reliable proxy if the galaxies are sufficiently distant, and that the density field evolution is a reliable proxy if the galaxies are sufficiently close. In both cases the reliability of the proxy decreases with the redshift. We then optimize the design of the survey to measure the evolution of this proxy as a function of redshift, while maximizing the reliability of the measurement and minimizing the survey cost. The optimized design is characterized by a varying density of galaxies as a function of redshift. We find that in order to have a reliable measurement of the dark energy density evolution the number density of galaxies needs to be larger at high redshift than the number density of galaxies in the local universe. We also find that in order to reliably test a modified gravity model the number density of galaxies needs to be smaller at high redshift than the number density of galaxies in the local universe. We then study the tradeoff between the survey cost and the reliability of the measurement, and find that the survey cost can be reduced by a factor of two without significantly compromising the reliability of the measurement by relaxing some of the assumptions made in the optimization. We finally discuss the practical implications of our method."}
{"text":"\nWe present a lattice dynamic study of the transmission of phonons across epitaxial interfaces. We consider a semi-infinite quantum well with a periodically modified barrier, which gives rise to two-dimensional (2D) quantum wells separated by a finite distance. We find that the phonon spectrum in the cross-section of the structure exhibits strong inter-well and intra-well coupling, and that the distribution of acoustic phonon states is extremely sensitive to the thickness and the lattice constant of the wells. By modifying the interface symmetry, we also find a strong influence of the symmetry and the confinement on the phonon spectrum. Our results show that the phonon band structure in such a cross-sectional geometry can be described by a single set of phonon eigenvalues, which is a linear combination of the phonon eigenvalues in the individual wells. We discuss the relevance of our findings for recent experiments on optoelectronic devices based on 2D quantum wells with periodically modified barriers."}
{"text":"\n\nHow a \"Hit\" is Born: The Emergence of Popularity from the Dynamics of Collective Choice\n\nWe study the emergence of popularity in a cultural market where consumers choose from a large number of items. We develop a model in which items are selected from a slate of options that is too large to allow for an efficient choice process. We find that the dynamics of choice have a crucial impact on the emergence of popularity. In particular, we show that the frequency with which an item is chosen can be sharply increased by creating an item that is chosen in between two other items that are already popular. To explore the mechanism behind this effect we introduce the concept of \"Russian Doll Learning,\" which captures the idea that consumers learn about the popularity of an item based on their own preferences as well as the preferences of other consumers. We show that Russian Doll Learning can dramatically increase the chances for an item to become popular, and that the effect is particularly strong when the number of items is large. Our findings help to explain why some items become extremely popular even though they do not possess any unique features that would make them stand out from other items."}
{"text":"\n\nWe introduce a class of 2D mechanical systems which have a natural generalization of the privileged signature of particles in Euclidean space, to signatures which are only determined up to an overall non-signed rotation. We show that this class of systems contains examples which are symmetric under a generalization of the proper Lorentz transformation to the 2D plane, and derive an action principle for this class of systems. The resulting system is symmetric under the full Lorentz group, but in general not under the proper Lorentz group. We analyze this system and find a close connection with the Poincare group. We show that for this class of systems the configuration space has a structure of a Poincare-space, and that this structure is related to the signatures of the particles. As an application, we show that the structure of the Poincare space of this class of systems can be used to construct an exotic type of mechanical system, with two different types of particles with different masses and moments of inertia."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present an analysis of the X-ray spectra of 37 Seyfert 1 galaxies in an attempt to identify the origin of the soft excess. We find that the absorption by a non-Thermoelectric effect (TE) Compton thin atmosphere is able to produce the soft excess in the same way as the more massive atmosphere recently found in our Galaxy. The Compton thin atmosphere is consistent with the assumption that the gas is optically thick in the UV band and the X-ray emission is produced by an extended hot layer below the Compton thin atmosphere. The X-ray absorption by the Compton thin atmosphere has the same shape as the one found by 1996R visit: the soft excess is due to the difference between the power law continuum and the absorbed power law continuum. We show that the effect of the absorption by a Compton thin atmosphere on the soft excess is very sensitive to the shape of the power law continuum. The observed soft excesses in the Seyfert 1 galaxies could be explained if the power law continuum is produced by a one-temperature atmosphere with a temperature around 6 kK. This result is consistent with the assumption that the gas is optically thick in the UV band. We also show that the ratio of the Compton thin absorption to the power law continuum is independent on the hard X-ray excesses. Our results suggest that the majority of the Seyfert 1 galaxies (at least those with soft excesses larger than 1.5 kK) have a Compton thin atmosphere. The present result strongly supports a absorption origin for the soft excess in Seyfert 1 galaxies."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a catalog of 667 hard-spectrum XMM-Newton sources observed with the XMM-SSC, of which 88 are previously uncataloged. We determine the luminosities, distances, and blueshifts of these sources based on their optical\/NIR observations, and use these values to derive the absolute ultraviolet (UV) and X-ray fluxes and the spectral indices of the sources. We find that the X-ray luminosities of the sources in our sample are, on average, 1.5 kml$^{-1}$, with a range from $3 \\times 10^{36}$ erg s$^{-1}$ to $8 \\times 10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$. We find that a significant fraction (70%) of our hard-spectrum XMM-Newton sources exhibit count rates that are modulated with the orbital period of the XMM-Newton spacecraft, in agreement with the prediction of Smith & 1996 that such modulation would be present for sources that are gravitationally lensed by the accretion disc of the Galactic black hole. The largest X-ray source in our sample is the microquasar SGR 1900+14, which is a potential candidate for being a future target for XMM-Newton observation. The X-ray flux of this source is $1.75 \\times 10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$, which makes it the second brightest X-ray source in our sample. We have derived absolute X-ray fluxes for all of the bright XMM-Newton sources in our sample, except for SGR 1900+14, by combining our XMM-Newton observations with archival data from the Rossi-RXTE satellite. We find that a significant fraction (70%) of our bright XMM-Newton sources exhibit count rates that are modulated with the orbital period of the XMM-Newton spacecraft, in agreement with the prediction of Smith & 1996 that such modulation would be present for sources that are gravitationally lensed by the accretion disc of the Galactic black hole."}
{"text":"\nWe present an ab initio density functional theory (DFT) study of the electronic structure of the perovskite superconductor BaFeO3. The electronic structure is investigated in the framework of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA). The results show that the electronic and magnetic properties of this material are governed by the Fe 3+ moments. We find a strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) with a large orbital moment of the order of magnitude of the total magnetic moment. This large SOC couples the magnetic and electronic degrees of freedom, which are responsible for the unconventional superconducting behavior of this compound. We also found the existence of a very large two-particle singlet pairing amplitude, which is equally important for the superconductivity. We show that this large pairing amplitude can be explained by a strong three-dimensional lattice distortion in the charge density. Our results are consistent with the idea that the pairing amplitude is enhanced by a large spatial extent of the charge transfer from the Fe 3+ to the O 2\u2212 ."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider the Lieb-Oxford bound on the energies of entangled states of massive particles. We show that this bound is tight for all possible entangled states of massive particles and therefore rules out a number of potential extensions of quantum mechanics that would relax this bound. This rules out, in particular, any version of hidden variables theory in which the bound is relaxed, unless the physical parameters of the theory are such that massive particles can be prepared in states that do not correspond to a well-defined position-momentum pair. We show that such states can be achieved in a version of hidden variables theory in which the position and momentum operators do not commute, provided that the bound is replaced by a weaker one that still holds for all states of massive particles. We show further that this still rules out a number of hidden variables theories that are usually considered to be candidates for a theory beyond quantum mechanics. We then consider a generalization of the Lieb-Oxford bound to a class of noncommutative probability spaces that includes as a special case the probability spaces of quantum mechanics. We show that this generalization of the bound is equivalent to the original one, in that it rules out any extension of quantum mechanics in which the bound is relaxed."}
{"text":"\nWe consider a second post-Newtonian approximation of the scalar-tensor theory of gravity. The approximation is found by using the straightforward and systematic method of the Einstein-Infeld theory. The resulting theory contains two sets of adjustable parameters. The first set describes the dynamics of the scalar field and the second describes the dynamics of the tensor field. The theory is shown to be equivalent to the Abraham-Lorentz-Freund theory in a certain limit. The exact solution of the theory is found in the form of a power series in the small parameter entering the evolution kernel. The structure of the series is discussed. The first two terms of the series are shown to give a good description of the behavior of the theory in the limit in which the effect of the scalar field is to create a constant gravity field. The form of the evolution kernel in the first two terms is very similar to the evolution kernel of the theory in the limit in which the tensor field has a constant value."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a large scale extinction map of the Galactic Anticenter from 2MASS. This map covers an area of approximately 20 deg^2, which is about 4 times as large as the previous largest Galactic extinction map. The new map, which is based on a catalog of 2MASS point sources, has a total of 96547 points, with a mean spacing of 3.6 arcmin. We have estimated the extinction for each of these points using the IRS2 data, and have found the extinction to range from A_0 = 0.0 to A_0 = 4.4 mag. In comparison, the previous largest map had an extinction range of only A_0 = 2.4 - 3.2 mag. The large scale of this map, in addition to allowing a more precise measurement of the extinction in the Galactic Anticenter region, also allows the study of large scale structures in the Galactic plane which were previously not well sampled. We find that the extinction is well described by a superposition of several smoothly varying functions, which are associated with known features in the Galactic plane, such as the Galactic bar and the high surface brightness regions (the coal clouds). We find that the extinction in the outer Galactic disk (rim) is higher than in the inner Galactic disk (core), in contrast to the trend found in the Galactic center. We discuss this finding in the context of the location of the major sources of dust in the Galactic plane, and in the context of possible paths for the migration of both gas and dust in the Galactic disk."}

{"text":"\n\nWe investigate the effect of planetesimal bombardment on the evolution of post-T Tauri stars (PTTSs) by comparing the metallicities of PTTSs with and without detected planets. We find that the metallicities of stars with detected giant planets are significantly higher than those of stars without detected giant planets, regardless of whether the stars are single or binary. This result suggests that giant planets in the disk-shedding phase heat the inner part of the accretion disk, which then increases the metallicity of the star. We also find a significant correlation between the orbital period of giant planets and the metallicities of PTTSs. Stars with giant planets that have orbital periods longer than 5 days have significantly higher metallicities than stars with giant planets that have shorter orbital periods. We discuss several physical mechanisms that might explain our results, including the effect of the giant planet on the evolution of the accretion disk and the possible production of planetesimals."}
{"text":"\nReconciliation of Zero-Point and Dark Energies in a Friedman Dust Universe with Einstein's Lambda\n\nWe have recently proposed a model in which the cosmological constant, in the role of a zero-point energy, couples to a particle \u00a0source and provides a dark energy component to the universe. This model has the advantage of avoiding the big bang singularity. In this paper we show that the model has a further conceptual advantage: it can be used to reconcile the two puzzles of dark energy and the zero-point energy. We do this by showing that a Friedman dust universe with a cosmological constant can be described by a modified Boltzmann equation in which the total energy is split between a cosmological term proportional to the cosmological constant and a pressure term proportional to the zero-point energy. This model is consistent with a slow-rolling scalar field and the observed accelerating expansion of the universe. Thus, we can avoid the big bang singularity by using a combination of the cosmological constant and the zero-point energy to provide the dark energy component necessary to explain the observed accelerating expansion of the universe."}
{"text":"\nAccurate QCD predictions for heavy-quark jets at the Tevatron and LHC\n\nWe present the first set of predictions, based on a next-to-leading order QCD calculation, for the heavy-quark jet cross section at the Tevatron and LHC. We consider the cross sections for heavy quarkonia (H), charmonia (D), and bottomonia (B) production in association with a jet, and for the direct production of heavy quarks (H, Z, W). We find that the heavy-quark jet cross section is small compared to the standard jet cross section, but has a large component of intermediate-pT jets with H and D production, and a small but non-zero contribution to the high-pT tail with H, D, and B production. We evaluate the production cross section of a heavy-quark jet in the context of QCD, and compare it to the latest theoretical and experimental results. We find good agreement with the available data, and an improvement over the next-to-leading order prediction of Ref. [hep-ph\/0609105]. We also evaluate the heavy-quark jet cross section in the forward region, and find a large forward-boost factor which is in agreement with the data. We predict a small though non-zero heavy-quark jet cross section at the LHC, and evaluate its contribution to the total jet cross section."}
{"text":"\nWe present a measurement of the two-dimensional (2D) shower structure for neutral mesons at the Double Chooz near detector. The measurement is performed with a new detector consisting of two layers of MD3 electromagnetic calorimeters placed at the upstream and downstream positions, and a control barrel detector. The detector is able to measure the longitudinal development of the shower, as well as its position and direction relative to the beam axis. We find that the longitudinal development of the shower is very well described by a simple exponential model. A fit to this model gives a mean length of 8.75 m for the shower development, and a standard deviation of 1.3 m. We also find a correlation between the longitudinal and lateral distribution of the shower particles. This correlation is in good agreement with the expectations from the Constant Fever model. Finally, we observe a significant preference for backward particle showers, and we measure a backward to forward ratio of 1.28 +0.10 \u22120.08."}
{"text":"\nWe present multidimensional (MD) supernova (SN) simulations with approximative neutrino transport in a geometrically convergent numerical scheme. We study the impact of neutrino transport on the hydrodynamics of the core and the resulting shock-wave\/sound-wave feedback. We consider a simple form of neutrino transport, where the transported flux is proportional to the mean density. In this way we are able to study the qualitative effects of neutrino transport on the supernova evolution, and we isolate the physical processes which are most sensitive to the inclusion of neutrinos. We find that the main effects of neutrino transport are a faster and more efficient mixing of the core, and a faster and more precise adjustment of the shock-wave\/sound-wave feedback. We also find that the inclusion of neutrino transport has a significant effect on the efficiency of the advective-acoustic cycle in the supernova core, and that the resulting efficiency depends sensitively on the neutrino energy distribution. We discuss the physical origin of these effects."}
{"text":"\nWe propose a new deformation principle of physics based on the \" principle of least action \". The action is here defined as a functional of the densities of the basic physical quantities in the configuration space. The principle of least action is equivalent to the Euler-Lagrange equation in the usual formulation of classical mechanics, but has also a general meaning, independent of the Lagrangian formalism. We show that this new deformation principle is consistent with the principles of relativity and quantum mechanics, and we propose a further geometrization of the physical laws based on this principle. In particular, we show that the fundamental physical laws can be obtained by a local minimum of the action functional, under the assumptions that the dynamics is described by a flow in the configuration space, and that the action is invariant under proper deformations of the configuration space. As an application, we show that the principle of least action is equivalent to the Hamiltonian principle in the case of a flow with a given symmetry."}
{"text":"\n\nMemory is a complex process that is not fully understood. There are many different types of memory, and the way they are formed and stored can vary greatly. A balanced memory network is a theoretical model that attempts to explain how memory is formed and stored. In this model, memory is formed by the interaction of three main processes: encoding, storage, and retrieval. Encoding is the process of converting information from the environment into a form that can be stored in the memory network. Storage is the process of maintaining the information in the memory network. Retrieval is the process of accessing the information from the memory network and using it to guide behavior. The balanced memory network model attempts to balance the contributions of the three main processes to memory formation and storage. In this model, the encoding process is the most important for memory formation, while the storage process is the most important for memory maintenance. The retrieval process is the most important for memory access. This model has been used to explain how memory is formed and stored in a variety of contexts."}
{"text":"\nWe consider the statistical equilibrium fluctuations of an isolated system in a general state of statistical equilibrium, for a large number N of degrees of freedom. We show that the variance of the fluctuations is given by a simple expression, which contains the dimensions of the system and the temperature. This is a generalization of the equipartition theorem to an isolated system in statistical equilibrium. We also derive a simple expression for the variance of the fluctuations of the system's internal energy, in terms of the equipartition theorem and the system's thermodynamic parameters. This allows us to derive a general expression for the variance of the fluctuations of any physical quantity of interest, in terms of the equipartition theorem and the system's thermodynamic parameters. The results of this work have important practical applications in statistical mechanics, in the analysis of statistical equilibrium systems, and in statistical thermodynamics. The work also has theoretical implications for the definition and measurement of the temperature of a system in statistical equilibrium."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present photometric observations of the Cepheus A massive star cluster, taken as part of the Hubble Space Telescope proposals 14934 and 15082. We have imaged with milliarcsecond resolution, by means of three Near-Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer pointings, a large field of the cluster in the region of the high mass binary systems Cepheus Aa-Ab and Cepheus B. Our main aim was to search for objects in this region that might be potential members of a young (12-13 million year old) open cluster. We present here the detection of a possible photoevaporating rotating disk around the Cepheus Aa-Ab massive binary system. The disk, if it exists, would be oriented close to edge-on to our line of sight and at a projected distance of about 10 arcseconds from the primary star. We derive a mass for the disk of 2-3 Jupiter masses, assuming a density of 1.3-1.4 kg\/m3 and a thickness of 2-4 times the orbital radius. The disk would be the first photoevaporating disk detected in a star cluster and, if confirmed, it would provide further evidence for the importance of massive binary systems in the formation of planets."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider the detection of gravitational waves from a dominant population of massive black holes in galactic nuclei, driven by the galactic tidal forces from encounters between galaxies in the local group. We show that a burst of gravitational waves, with a moment magnitude of $M_{GW} \\sim 10^{-10}$, could be detected by advanced LIGO interferometers if the black holes are close enough to the galaxies' centers. We derive an expression for the characteristic frequency of the gravitational waves, $f_{GW} \\sim M_{black hole}\/R_{galactic center}$, where $M_{black hole}$ is the mass of the black hole and $R_{galactic center}$ is the radius of the host galaxy. The expected gravitational waves from the galactic nuclei would have a frequency of  \u223c 10 Hz, and would be much stronger than the background noise of LIGO interferometers. Thus, we would be able to detect such gravitational waves without advanced LIGO, and to observe the bursts of gravitational waves from the galactic nuclei would be a unique opportunity to study the properties of massive black holes.\n\nWe have proposed a new method to detect and observe the gravitational waves from the galactic nuclei.

{"text":"\n\nWe report on the observation of ground-state magneto-optical resonances in Cesium vapour confined in an extremely thin cell. Our observations are in good agreement with theoretical predictions based on a model of the light-condensed Cesium vapour. We show that the dynamics of the light-condensed Cesium vapour can be very well described by a six-level model, in spite of the fact that our measurements are in the transient regime of the condensation process. Our results suggest that the dynamics of the condensation process is very fast on a optical time scale. We have derived a simple expression for the number ratio of the two lowest resonance levels in terms of the density of Cesium vapour and the length of the vapor cell. Our findings are important for the further development of optical lattices, because they demonstrate that extremely thin cells can be used to confine Cesium vapour, in spite of the fact that Cesium has a high atomic number and is therefore difficult to confine by static electric fields."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present the results of a numerical investigation of the mass distribution of the galaxy cluster Cl 0024+17 from strong gravitational lensing. We have constructed a mass map of the cluster from a combination of measured lensing of the galaxies and the non-linear magnification of a background radio source. The mass map shows a clear signature of a bimodal mass distribution, with the light (blue) and the heavy (red) components separated by a region almost empty of matter. The mass distribution is in excellent agreement with a model in which the cluster is composed of two components: a clumpy structure with a distribution of mass according to the power law M \u221d r^(p), and a smooth structure with the distribution according to the correlation function Mc \u221d (r\/R)^(q), where R is the scale of the correlation function. We show that a simple model in which the two components are dynamically coupled cannot reproduce the observed mass distribution. We discuss several physical explanations of the origin of the bimodal structure."}
{"text":"\nWe study adiabatic pumping through a quantum dot in the Kondo regime. We consider the limit of infinitely long pump and pullback pulses, which allows us to use the exact quantum hydrodynamic equations. Our focus is on the special case of a single-particle state in a magnetic nanocontainer, which is relevant for spintronic applications. We show that a strong pump pulse can drive a single-particle current, even if the pump pulse is applied along the thermodynamic path of the nanocontainer. We find the exact dynamics of the system in the limit of infinitely long pulses and a large pump rate, in terms of a single-particle Green function. We analyze the different contributions to the dynamics and show that the relaxation of the system is slow in the limit of infinitely long pulses. Our results are consistent with the idea that a long-lived \"resonating\" state is formed in the limit of infinitely long pulses. The relaxation of this state can be controlled by a subsequent \"pullback\" pulse, which has a different frequency than the pump pulse. Our theory can be tested by performing actual experiments with infinitely long pulses."}
{"text":"\nWe propose a model for the critical ionization velocity effect in a weakly collisional plasma and examine the possibility of detecting the related continuum emission. Our model consists of a collisionless, unstable, and nonlinear stage, followed by a collisional stage with a simple power-law distribution of ionization equilibrium. We solve numerically the resulting kinetic equation and show that our model is consistent with the general features of the critical ionization velocity effect observed in the local interstellar medium, although a detailed comparison requires a kinetic treatment of the ionization equilibrium. We show that the effect is most efficiently detected in the frequency domain, and we derive a simple expression for the detection threshold in terms of the plasma and spectral parameters. Our results suggest that the critical ionization velocity effect is potentially detectable with existing and upcoming astronomical instruments, provided that the plasma is collisional and not too hot."}

{"text":"\nWe have measured the magnetization and the specific heat of single crystals of TbFe3(BO3)4 as a function of temperature, magnetic field and pressure. Our results are consistent with the existence of a transition temperature below which the magnetic moments of the terbium atoms are coupled antiferromagnetically, and, in addition, with the presence of a substantial non-magnetic fraction of moments below this temperature. The specific heat data are consistent with a model in which the magnetic moments are fully localized, but also show an excess heat capacity at low temperatures which is consistent with the presence of a small number of magnetic domains. The temperature dependence of the magnetization and the specific heat are consistent with the picture of a transition from a fully magnetic to a fully non-magnetic state on increasing temperature, in spite of the fact that the magnetic fraction does not change sharply at the transition temperature. We discuss the results in terms of a model of the magnetic properties, which we have developed from the known crystal field parameters."}
{"text":"\nWe present a possible explanation why the \u03b8+ is seen in some experiments and not in others.

We show that the probability for the \u03b8+ to be excited can be very small, provided that the vacuum state is very close to a symmetry state of the model. As an application, we discuss the case of the \u03b8+ in an axion-less model of the strong force, where it is expected to be very weakly excited.

{"text":"\nWe introduce a family of exactly solvable models of spin chains with interactions only between nearest neighbors. The interactions are taken to be of the form ZZ, with Z a polynomial in the spins of the two neighboring sites. This class of models includes the Suen-Cederbaum-Fock spin chain as a special case. We show that such models are characterized by a very simple dynamics, in which the spins of all the sites evolve in a concerted way. We pay particular attention to the case of a chain with two different types of sites. In this case, the chain is capable of supporting excitations of different types, and we show that the ground state is always a superposition of different types of excitations. This in particular implies that the chain cannot be at the same time in a state in which all the spins are aligned along the same direction and in a state in which all the spins are aligned along different, but mutually parallel directions. We show further that the ground state of the chain can be obtained by a process of long-time evolution from a random initial state."}
{"text":"\nWe present optical BVI imaging and HI synthesis observations of the dwarf irregular galaxy ESO 364-G 029, which reveal a nearly face-on barred system with a well-defined bar and a half-symmetrically placed inner ring structure. We discuss the nature of the bar and ring and their possible interactions. The bar is the dominant feature in the stellar distribution and is responsible for the streaky HI distribution. The observed bar structure is consistent with a Keplerian profile, with a characteristic radius of 5.6 kpc and a mass of 4.4 kpc gas mass. The bar has a high surface brightness, and is therefore likely to be optically thick. We estimate the bar to be more than one thousand million years old. The observed bar is longer than the half-light radius, indicating that it is still accreting gas. The gas in the bar is slightly metal-poor compared to the gas in the outer parts of the disk, a signature of a successive accretion history. We show that the bar is responsible for the excess gas in the center of the galaxy. We estimate the current accretion rate to be at least 10^( \u2212 3). The gas in the ring is metal-poor compared to the gas in the bar, suggesting that the ring is an older feature. The mean metallicity of the gas in the bar is 12 +log(O\/H) = 7.06, while the gas in the ring has a metallicity of 12 +log(O\/H) = 6.55. We discuss several possible formation scenarios for the bar and ring, and conclude that the bar has been formed by a violent interaction between the disk and a gas cloud. The ring may be a fossil feature, or it could have been formed by the interaction of the bar with a second gas cloud. The large vertical scale of the ring (6 kpc) indicates that the dynamics in the center of the galaxy is not two-body dominated, but rather has a more complicated three-body problem. We discuss this in the context of recent results for disk galaxy dynamics."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a study of the X-ray spectrum of the broad-line radio galaxy 3C 445. We find that the iron line at 6.4 keV is significantly blended with a line at 7.2 keV, which we attribute to the decay of radioactive thorium. This is the first detection of a thorium line in the X-ray spectrum of a galaxy. The intensity of the thorium line is at least one order of magnitude higher than that of the iron line. The observed count rate of the thorium line is also one order of magnitude higher than the predicted one based on the measured thorium content in the galaxy. This implies that the thorium is not distributed homogeneously in the inner 4 kpc of the galaxy, and there may be a large amount of thorium in the central region. The observation also suggests that the 6.4 keV iron line may be contaminated by the thorium line in many broad-line radio galaxies. We have estimated the energy distribution of the X-ray radiation from the non-thermal continuum, and find that the contribution from the thermal continuum is only 7% of the total X-ray flux. This suggests that the accretion onto the supermassive black hole in the central region is not very efficient. The fraction of the X-ray flux from the core region of 3C 445 is estimated to be about 30%. The shape of the X-ray spectrum is well described by a power law with a photon index of 1.8. We have compared the X-ray spectra of 3C 445 with those of three other nearby broad-line radio galaxies (3C 231, 3C 334, and 3C 933), and found that they are very different. This suggests that the accretion onto the supermassive black hole is efficient in some broad-line radio galaxies, but not in others."}
{"text":"\n\nWe study a model of collaborative communication systems where the underlying channel is time-varying and the receivers are allowed to make use of a noisy and inexpensive clock synchronization protocol. We show that a lack of symmetry in the channel may drastically degrade the performance of the synchronization protocol, and consequently the performance of the communication system, in terms of achievable throughput and delay. We propose a simple technique which, under certain assumptions, can improve the performance of the communication system by means of a clocked cooperative communication protocol. Our technique is based on the idea of turning the channel into a symmetric-like channel by appropriately designing the communication schedule. We show that under our assumptions, the proposed technique can achieve a performance close to that achievable by a protocol designed for a symmetric channel, in terms of delay and throughput. We complement our theoretical analysis with simulation results."}
{"text":"\nWe have developed a new method for the determination of dislocations in electron diffraction, based on the analysis of the Kikuchi patterns. The method is sensitive to the dislocation density, independent of the dislocation distribution, and does not require an empirical calibration curve. We have applied the method to a single crystal of YBa2Cu3O7, a good conductor, in which the dislocation density has been previously determined by theReachfug technique. Our results agree with the previous determination, but, in addition, we have found that the dislocations are not distributed randomly, but tend to be arranged in a preferred direction, which we attribute to the influence of the magnetic field. We have also determined the dislocation density in a single crystal of SrTiO3, a bad conductor, and in a polycrystalline sample of YBa2Cu3O7. In both cases, the dislocation density was much higher than in the single crystal.

{"text":"\n\nWe present an evaluation of the viability of gyrochronology for dating field stars in terms of the precision that can be achieved, the limitations of the method, and the sources of error. We pay particular attention to the underlying assumptions and the propagation of errors through the various steps of the process. We find that the precision that can be achieved with this method is in the range of 10\u201320%, depending on the accuracy with which the disk orbital elements can be measured. The main limitation is the assumption of a constant orbital decay rate, which can be relaxed only if the disk's inner edge is sufficiently sharp. This is not likely to be the case for low-mass disks such as those around T Tauri stars. In any case, the sources of error are not negligible. In particular, we show that a poorly constrained orbital model can produce a date for a given field star that is in disagreement with the true age by as much as several hundred million years. We also show that, unless the orbital elements of a given disk can be constrained to high accuracy early in the process, the obtained age is likely to be very uncertain. Therefore, this method is not likely to provide reliable absolute ages for field stars, but it may be useful for dating young stellar objects if a sufficient number of independent data sets can be obtained to constrain the orbital model."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a method to convert a genetic network dynamics into a spatial pattern. We consider a generic boolean genetic network and we show that, if the logical depth of the network is larger than two, the spatial pattern exhibits quasi-oscillations of the spatial frequency. We show that this is due to a slow-down of the dynamics at the spatial boundaries, which results in the formation of standing waves. We characterize the threshold spatial frequency for which the dynamics is stable against changes in the initial conditions. If the spatial frequency is lower than this threshold, the dynamics is stable against changes in the initial conditions, and we show that the associated spatial pattern is robust to changes in the underlying boolean network. As an application, we consider the evolution of the segmental identity in the context of a small genetic network and we show that the dynamics can be stable against changes in the initial conditions, provided that the spatial frequency is lower than a threshold. We discuss the relation between the dynamics of the underlying genetic network and the resulting spatial pattern."}
{"text":"\nWe present photometric detections of 31 members of the massive stellar cluster Westerlund 1, and a membership probability assessment for a further 21 candidates, using deep imaging of the cluster field obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope. We determine the distance to the cluster, using the luminosities and temperatures of the detected members, to be 1.004 \u00b1 0.009 kpc. We use the distances and the locations of the members in the sky to search for evidence of the presence of a three-body resonance, and find that the data are consistent with the cluster being in a pure stage II $4:1$ resonance. We determine the mass of the cluster to be $M \\sim 2.3 x 10^5 M_{\\odot}$. We find that the kinematic properties of the cluster, its age, and its chemical composition are consistent with it having formed in a single burst of star formation. We conclude that the high concentration of massive stars in such a small volume of space implies that a similar mechanism may have been responsible for the formation of the most massive stars and clusters in other galaxies."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a simple model that relates the formation of stars to the growth of stellar mass in a galaxy. We show that this model can explain the observed correlation between stellar mass and star formation rate, as well as the observed correlation between the star formation rate and the gas mass in a galaxy. Our model is based on the assumption that the gas distribution in a galaxy is governed by the gravity of the stars. In this way, the gas follows the distribution of the stars, and as a result, the gas is denser where there are already many stars. This mechanism naturally explains why stellar mass and star formation are correlated. Our model also predicts that the gas mass in a galaxy is correlated with the star formation rate, and that the gas mass is higher where the star formation rate is higher. We show that this prediction is consistent with observations. Our model also explains why the mass of a star is correlated with its age. Our model predicts that the growth rate of stellar mass is proportional to the star formation rate, which is consistent with observations. In addition, our model predicts that the distribution of stellar mass in a galaxy is flat, which is also consistent with observations. We discuss the implications of our model for the evolution of galaxies."}
{"text":"\nWe present an analysis of the influence of orbital behaviour and chaos on the shape of dark matter halos. We consider the simplest possible model of a halo, the virialized spherically symmetric halo, and examine how its shape responds to different assumptions about the underlying dynamics. We find that for halos with a standard dark matter profile the effect of orbital behaviour is very small, while the shape is very sensitive to the injection of large-scale structure. We also find that the shape of the halo is very sensitive to the assumption of a steady state or a time varying dynamics. By comparing the shape of halos in the presence of a potential field that follows an arbitrary time dependence and that is either steady or time dependent we find that the cross section of halos can be modified in a way that is consistent with observations of halos in galaxies. Our analysis also suggests that a correct treatment of the dynamics of dark matter halos may require a detailed consideration of the underlying spatial and temporal dependence of the potential field, an aspect that is often neglected in the literature."}
{"text":"\nWe have developed a new method for computing the free energy of the alpha helix-coil phase transition in polypeptides, based on the use of the ab initio theory of statistical thermodynamics. The method is applied to a series of model peptides with different amino acid sequences. In all cases the computed free energy has the same functional form, independent of the amino acid sequence, with two distinct minima corresponding to the helical and the coil conformations. The separation between the two minima is much larger for the L-form peptides than for the D-form peptides, which is consistent with the general observation that the helical conformation is more stable in the L-form than in the D-form peptides. The parameters of the free energy are related to the helix-coil transition temperature through a simple formula, which is consistent with the experimental observation that the transition temperature is proportional to the inverse of the helical stability. The possible structural explanations for the origin of the two minima are discussed, in terms of the difference between the L-form and D-form peptides."}

In particular, this has practical applications in financial modeling, where it can be used to price certain types of options and derivatives. The motivation for this research comes from the need to have a better understanding of the behavior of financial assets, and in particular, the need to be able to detect and respond to market risk in a more efficient manner.

{"text":"\n\nWe present spatially resolved kinematics and stellar population properties of the brightest cluster and group galaxies (BCGs), based on a sample of 24 galaxies in 19 groups and clusters selected from the SDSS, and three galaxies in the Leo Group from VLA\/CVF data. We find that the kinematics and stellar populations of the BCGs are well described by two parameters: the cluster\/groupcentric distance and the galaxycentric distance within the group\/cluster. The kinematics and stellar population properties of a given galaxy vary smoothly and continuously with these two distances, and change abruptly at the boundary of the group\/cluster. We find no evidence of kinematic or stellar population differentiation within a group\/cluster, except possibly in the Leo Group, although the sample is small. We find a correlation between the kinematic properties and stellar population properties, indicating that both are driven by the same physical mechanism. We show that the observed correlation can be explained by a simple model in which the galaxies are described by a set of parameters that vary smoothly and continuously with the cluster\/groupcentric and galaxycentric distances. We use the model to predict the kinematic and stellar population properties of a galaxy in a face-on group\/cluster, and find that the predicted properties agree well with observations, supporting the model. We discuss the implications of our results for the role of the group\/cluster environment in shaping the kinematic and stellar population properties of galaxies, and for the use of the group\/cluster environment as a probe of galactic structure and evolution."}

{"text":"\n\nWe present here results of a numerical study of the origin of the galaxy mass-metallicity relation in a cosmological hydrodynamical framework. We find that the mass-metallicity relation is naturally explained by an outwards-driven chemically-homogeneous metal-poor accretion flow, where the accretion rate is proportional to the galaxy mass. We show that this relation can be formed in two different ways: (i) by an accretion flow that is uniform in mass but variable in metallicity, or (ii) by an accretion flow that is variable in mass and uniform in metallicity. In both cases the relation is stable against small fluctuations in the accretion flow, provided that the relative metallicity stays small. We discuss the cosmological implications of our results. In particular, we show that if the metallicity of the accretion flow is variable, the relation must have been formed in a very small volume, while if the metallicity is uniform, the relation can be formed in a large volume, provided that the mass of the accretion flow is variable. We also discuss the implications of our results for the origin of the chemical homogeneity of galaxies. We find that a chemically-homogeneous accretion flow, if it is metal-poor, can only be the result of a past massive accretion event, and that such an event must have been rare in the history of the galaxy. We finally comment on the hypothesis that the mass-metallicity relation is due to the evaporation of a massive molecular cloud, and we show that this hypothesis is inconsistent with the present-day distribution of metals in the galactic halo."}
{"text":"\nWe present photometric observations of the brown-dwarf eclipsing binary 2MASS J05352184-0546085, which show a surprising reversal of temperatures in the primary and secondary components. The system consists of a +62\u00b0C brown dwarf with a mass of 73 MJup, and a \u221234\u00b0C brown dwarf with a mass of 50 MJup. We observe the system in photometric twilight, when the brighter object is occulted by the cooler object. The system has been observed with the 2MASS survey, the Magellan Telescopes, and the Very Large Array. We find that the masses of the two brown dwarfs are too close to be explained by a single mass model in which the masses are equal. This suggests that the system must have formed through the fragmentation of a single object, with the two fragments having very different temperatures. This is the first system in which a significant change in temperature between components has been detected, and the first demonstration that brown-dwarf binaries can be formed by the fragmentation of a single object."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present observations of a fast halo coronal mass ejection (CME) observed on 2011 May 22 using the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) and the Swedish 1.5 GHz Ring Array (RANET). We find that the radio emission associated with the CME is generated by two distinct regions: a linear structure that is likely the result of arcading magnetic fields and a large-scale, low-frequency structure that is likely due to the CME's interaction with the ring current. We show that the radio emission can be explained by the impulsive turbulentplugin instability. The relative importance of different instability mechanisms depends on the frequency and the dynamic range of the source. We find that in this event the dominant mechanism is theplugin instability with a growth rate of  $\\sim$ 20%\/Re$. We also find that the low-frequency component is likely to be excited by a different mechanism than the high-frequency one, with the growth rate of  $\\sim$ 4%\/Re$^{2}$.

{"text":"\n\nWe have recently investigated the variation of the Amati relation with the cosmological redshift, and found that the probability distribution of the amplitudes of the galaxy redshifts is not in accordance with the prediction of the Amati relation. We have interpreted this result as a possible selection effect due to the fact that we consider only galaxies with known redshifts in our sample, and thus the relation might not hold for galaxies without measured redshifts. We have also pointed out that an evolution effect might have contributed to the discrepancy between the prediction of the Amati relation and the observations. The evolution effect could have acted during the period of the Universe when the galaxies in our sample have been formed, and the evolution speed of the relation might have been higher than the evolution speed of the galaxies. We have discussed that the evolution effect can be tested by a detailed study of the variation of the Amati relation with the galaxy age and with the surface or volume density of the ambient medium. Here we briefly comment on the problem."}
{"text":"\n\nWe extend the method of sums over geometries to the setting of planar redistributions and show how the resulting series can be used to derive exact or very simple formulas for various geometric properties of planar redistributions.

We also show that every convex body in the plane can be covered by a minimal number of translates of a symmetric convex body and that the minimal number is the same as the one returning the convex body to its symmetric position. As by-products, we show that every polygonal chain can be covered by a minimal number of translates of a convex polygon and that every convex body can be covered by a minimal number of translates of a symmetric convex body.

The huge direct CP violation in this channel could be a serious problem for the SM. We show that the direct CP violation in this channel could be reduced to a very small number, about $10^{-8}$, by a simple trick, i.e. to consider the direct CP violation only in the massless case. Since the massless case is very close to the massive case in this channel, the direct CP violation in this channel is small in the massive case as well. Therefore the large direct CP violation in the SM is not a serious problem.\n\nWe also show that the direct CP asymmetry in this channel is not sensitive to the intermediate $\\rho^0(\\omega)$ and $\\omega$, where $\\omega$ is the first harmonic resonance."}
{"text":"\nWe present the first three-dimensional measurement of the transverse polarization of quasireal photoproduction of the Lambda and Lambda-bar hyperons. The measurement was made with the BaBar detector at the PEP-II asymmetric-energy e+e- accelerator at SLAC. We find the transverse polarization fraction to be larger than previously measured with the PEP-II Removeable Pole (RPP) detector at the same accelerator. The large rate of unpolarized photoproduction at small transverse momenta, and the large fraction of longitudinal polarization at large transverse momenta are in agreement with the predictions of theLarry- Missile- Banana (LMB) model. A possible explanation for the discrepancy between the current result and the previous result from the RPP detector is that the longitudinal polarization of the emissive radiation in the LMB model is smaller than observed.\n\nWe also present a model for the transverse polarization of the photoproduction of the Lambda and Lambda-bar hyperons based on the assumption that the polarization is governed by the same mechanisms that govern the polarization of the light emitted by a linear accelerator. This model successfully predicts the polarization dependence on the transverse momenta and the longitudinal polarization fractions observed in both the RPP and the BaBar measurements."}
{"text":"\nWe present photospheric observations of the magnetic polarity of two photospheric lines in the single spectrum of the quiet Sun. The observations were made with the Solar Ultraviolet Measurements of Emitted Radiation spectrometer on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory. The motivation for our research was the inference of the polarity of magnetic features in the photosphere from the observation of opposite polarity in the Corona, as has been reported by previous observations with the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory. Our key idea was to use the high spatial resolution of the Solar Ultraviolet Measurements of Emitted Radiation spectrometer to obtain information on the magnetic polarity of small-scale features in the photosphere. Our methodology was to compare the peak intensity of the photospheric lines in the spectrum of a small area of the photosphere with the integrated intensity of the photospheric lines in the spectrum of a large area of the photosphere. The results of our research are that we were able to infer the magnetic polarity of two photospheric lines in the single spectrum of the quiet Sun, and that the inferred magnetic polarity was in agreement with the polarity of large-scale features in the photosphere, as has been reported by other observations. We have been able to resolve a problem that has been discussed in the context of solar physics: the problem of determining the magnetic polarity of small-scale features in the photosphere. The practical application of our findings is that we can use the knowledge of the magnetic polarity of small-scale features in the photosphere to obtain further information on the structure and evolution of the solar corona. The theoretical application of our findings is that we can use the knowledge of the magnetic polarity of small-scale features in the photosphere to obtain further information on the magnetic structure of the solar interior."}
{"text":"\n\nWe report a scanning magnetoresistance microscopy technique that is capable of detecting local magnetic properties with submicron spatial resolution on atom chips. The technique is based on a combination of a scanning tunneling microscope and a ferromagnetic tip that is insulated from the sample. By scanning the tip over the sample surface, we are able to map the local magnetic properties with a spatial resolution of a few nanometers over a large area. The technique can be used to detect the presence of magnetic islands on atom chips, to characterize their magnetic properties, and to study the local stray field and its effect on the atom chip surface. We demonstrate the ability of the technique to image the local magnetic properties of a variety of atom chips, including those made from magnetic and non-magnetic materials, and to map the local stray field on a magnetic atom chip. The technique provides new insights into the local magnetic properties of atom chips and is an important step towards the development of magnetic atom chips for high-density data storage and quantum information processing."}
{"text":"\n\nWe propose a simple parameterization of the turbulent diffusion term in a microphysical cloud model in order to improve the model performance. The new parameterization includes a length scale that is optimized to give the best fit to the observations of the chemical composition of cloud water in diffuse clouds. The optimization is done by a comparison with the results of a more sophisticated cloud model that includes a full turbulence module. Our parameterization is simple enough to be included in a general circulation model. We evaluate the effects of the new parameterization on the global distribution of cloud cover, the chemical composition of cloud water, and the transport of chemical species in the atmosphere. The main finding is that the parameterization gives a better fit to the observations than the conventional parameterization, especially in the lowermost kilometers of the atmosphere, where the cloud base is located. This is important because this region is the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. The effects of the new parameterization on the transport of chemical species are small but consistent. The new parameterization gives slightly different values for the concentrations of chemical species in the atmosphere than the conventional parameterization, especially in the lowermost kilometers. This difference is within the uncertainties of the global chemical transport models."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate the cosmological Casimir effect with maximum Planckian momentum and an accelerating universe. The motivating idea is to determine a general relativistic expression for the Casimir energy density in a cosmological model with a variable equation of state (EOS) parameter $w(a)$, where $a$ is the scale factor. The EOS parameter $w(a)$ is related to the stress-energy tensor $T_{\\mu\\nu}$ by the relation $w(a)=Tr({\\dot \\gamma}^\\mu\\dot\\gamma^\\nu\\over \\dot a^2})$, where $\\dot\\gamma^\\mu$ is the four-velocity of a moving relativistic mass-energy $\\gamma^\\mu$. We employ the Stress-Energy-Momentum (SEM) framework for the analysis. Within the SEM framework, the cosmological Casimir effect with maximum Planckian momentum is related to the stress-energy tensor $T_{\\mu\\nu}$ by the relation $\\dot {\\dot T}^\\mu\\dot T^\\nu\\dot a^2=-\\dot T^\\mu\\dot T^\\nu\\dot a^2\\dot a^\\mu\\dot a^\\nu\\dot a^3$.

{"text":"\nWe consider the problem of the existence of a non-standard neutrino mixing angle in type-II seesaw and leptogenesis. We show that a deviation from the tri-bimaximal neutrino mixing would in general increase the number of leptons in the Universe, but could in principle be consistent with the current observations. The possibility of a non-standard neutrino mixing in type-II seesaw and leptogenesis is motivated by the recent progress in the theory of neutrino oscillations as well as by the fact that the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics does not have a unique solution to the problem of the leptonic asymmetry in the Universe. We show that the existence of a non-standard neutrino mixing angle in type-II seesaw and leptogenesis would in general lead to a violation of the assumption of the tri-bimaximal neutrino mixing, and as a consequence to a violation of the conservation of the leptonic charge. We show that a violation of the conservation of the leptonic charge can be avoided if the non-standard neutrino mixing angle is small, which in turn requires the smallness of the corresponding Yukawa couplings. We also discuss the possibility of a detection of a non-standard neutrino mixing angle in type-II seesaw and leptogenesis."}
{"text":"\nWe introduce a geometrical method, based on the symplectic structure of the equations of motion, for computing and analyzing the local dynamics in Hamiltonian systems. The method is based on the computation of the so-called Generalized Alignment Index (GALI), which provides a measure of the similarities between the directions of the local dynamics at different points in the phase space. By properly interpreting the GALI, we are able to extract the qualitative features of the local dynamics, including the existence of different types of invariant manifolds (e.g., symmetry, quasi-symmetry, and anti-symmetry manifolds) as well as the local stability of the various tori. We show that the GALI is closely related to the so-called Topological Alignment Index (TAI), recently introduced in the field of image analysis to extract the topological structure of geometrically transformed images. As an application, we present an analysis of the local dynamics in a simple model of glass transition, and show how the method can be used to compute the various local relaxation times."}

We suppose that the dirt on the floor is distributed according to a given probability measure and that the cleaner has two strategies available: a standard strategy, which is a fixed procedure that always cleans the floor in the same way, and a random strategy, which chooses a random path over the floor and thus has the potential to be more efficient in principle. We investigate the behavior of the random strategy as the dirt on the floor becomes more concentrated, that is, as the potential function becomes more non-null. We show that the random strategy converges to the standard strategy as the potential function goes to infinity. This convergence is guaranteed by a uniqueness theorem due to Dobrushin. We derive an approximation theorem that relates the random strategy to a finite number of non-overlapping regions of the floor, and thus to the kind of random walk that is known as a random walk on a lattice."}
{"text":"\n\nWe have examined the expressive power of recursive queries in database and logic programming systems. We have considered the languages of the following systems: the relational database management systems (DBMS) MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle RDBMS, the object-oriented DBMSs posed\/lapl\/ORBIS, and the logic programming systems (LPS) answer set programming (ASP), Datalog, and logic programming with Bags (LPB). We have classified the queries of each language into three classes: (1) the regular queries, (2) the recursive queries, and (3) the combination queries, i.e., the queries that mix regular and recursive features. We have analyzed the expressive power of the languages in terms of the classes of queries they support. The analysis has been done using the well-knownDirectNiclDrive algorithm. The results show that the expressive power of the languages in terms of the classes of queries they support are as follows: (1) the class of regular queries is equivalent for all the considered systems; (2) the class of recursive queries is not equivalent for any two of the considered systems; and (3) the class of combination queries is not equivalent for any two of the considered systems."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a wavelet analysis method on the sphere for exploring large scale structures in astrophysical data. Our method is based on the 2-scale spherical harmonics analysis, which enables us to investigate the power spectrum of the data in a given frequency range, as well as the multi-scale dependencies of the power spectrum. We show that our method is applicable to data from galaxy redshift surveys, and that it can be used to distinguish between different models of large scale structure formation.\n\nWe present a formalism which enables us to decompose the power spectrum on the sphere in a wavelet basis. We show that this decomposition is equivalent to the 2-scale spherical harmonics analysis. We derive the orthonormal basis of the wavelets and the associated spherical harmonics, and we show that the resulting wavelets are rotationally invariant, unlike the usual wavelets on the plane. The main new ingredient in our method is the use of a 2-scale scheme on the sphere.\n\nWe apply our method to two examples. In the first example we study the large scale power spectrum of the two-point function of galaxies in the Redshift Search of the Early Universe (REsure) survey, and in the second example we study the power spectrum of the one-point function of the same survey. We show that our method is able to distinguish between different models of large scale structure formation, in particular between the commonly used Gaussian random field and the recently proposed scale-free model.\n\nOur method is not limited to these examples, but can in principle be applied to any astrophysical data on the sphere. The method is also applicable to any data on the sphere which can be cast in a one-point or two-point function. We expect that our method will be particularly useful in exploring large scale structure in future galaxy redshift surveys, such as the planned two-point function survey of the Dark Energy Survey."}
{"text":"\n\nMass Loss and Evolution of Stars and Star Clusters: a Personal\n  Historical Perspective\n\nWe present a personal historical perspective on the research topics of mass loss and evolutionary theory of stars and star clusters. We review our own contributions to these topics, and place them in the context of the overall evolution of these research areas. We then discuss outstanding problems and questions, and describe future prospects for theoretical and observational advances. We focus on the three fundamental issues of mass loss and evolution: the relative importance of mass loss and evolutionary theory for the determination of the properties and evolution of stars and star clusters; the use of observations, especially of high-resolution spectroscopy, to constrain theoretical models of mass loss and evolution; and the confrontation and eventual reconciliation of different theoretical models of mass loss and evolution. We also discuss in some detail the problem of low-mass star formation and the evolution of planetary systems, and we highlight the key role that the study of mass loss and evolution must play in the investigation of the galactic habitable zone and the frequency and characteristics of life in the Universe."}
{"text":"\nWe introduce a new chaotic attractor in a basic multi-strain epidemiological model with temporary cross-immunity. The model consists of a system of three differential equations describing the evolution of the three different strains. Temporary cross-immunity causes the infection to switch between different strains. Our analysis shows that the new attractor is stable against changes in the initial conditions and remains stable in the limit of large populations. By using the newly obtained attractor we are able to give a detailed qualitative description of the dynamics of the system in the case without vaccination. We find that in this case the epidemiological model can exhibit three different types of behaviour: (i) an outbreak of one of the strains, (ii) a constant presence of all three strains at their carrying capacity, and (iii) a fast alternating sequence of outbreaks of the three strains. The first case occurs if the basic reproduction number of one of the strains is larger than the sum of the basic reproduction numbers of the other two strains. The second case occurs if the basic reproduction numbers of all three strains are equal. The third case is a generalization of the first case and occurs if the basic reproduction number of each strain is larger than the sum of the basic reproduction numbers of the other two strains. In all three cases the total population size is constant."}

{"text":"\n\nConfining ensemble of dyons\n\nWe investigate the statistical ensemble of dyons in a confined system with a constant cross-section area. We show that the statistical ensemble of dyons is related to the vectorial excursions of the driven particle. We derive a simple expression for the statistical ensemble in the limit of small Knudsen number. The result is consistent with the available experimental data. We also derive a simple expression for the auto-correlation function of the orientation angle of the statistical ensemble. The practical application of our result is in the field of condensed matter physics, in particular in the statistical mechanics of spin glasses. The statistical ensemble of dyons in a confined system is related to the so-called CENs (centered enlisted noises). In solid state physics, CENs are related to the spin glasses, in particular to the problem of random pairing. Our work gives a simple and general derivation of the statistical ensemble of dyons and a rigorous basis for the connection between the statistical ensemble of dyons and the spin glasses."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a cosmological hydrodynamical model for the formation of the disk galaxy M33, based on the assumption that the accretion of baryonic matter and the metal content are coupled in the process of galaxy evolution. We find that a strong metallicity gradient is naturally built up during the evolution of the disk, with the metal abundance in the core increasing by a factor of about three from the birth to the present time. This is consistent with the observed metallicity distribution in M33, provided that the stars in the core were formed early in the history of the galaxy, while those in the outer parts were formed later. We also show that the large-scale distribution of the molecular hydrogen in M33 is due to a strong evolution of the chemical composition, in particular to the removal of the gas in the core. We discuss the relevance of our results for the understanding of chemical evolution in disk galaxies, and in particular for the controversy about the nature of the molecular hydrogen in M33."}
{"text":"\n\nThe motivation for this work is to determine the ionization fraction of Barnard 68, a nearby oxygen-rich supergiant, to better constrain the ionization structure in its inner wind, and to determine if the fraction is consistent with ionization by the central star. We find that the ionization fraction is about 1%. The high ionization fraction of Barnard 68 is inconsistent with the assumption that the ionization is due to the central star, unless the star is much more luminous than previously thought. We discuss two possible solutions to this inconsistency: (1) the ionization fraction has been overestimated due to the foreground-background confusion, or (2) the inner wind has been photoionized by a hotter, more luminous object in the background. We show that a background ionizer can explain the high ionization fraction, while preserving the assumption that the ionization is due to a single object. We conclude that further observations are required to distinguish between these two solutions."}
{"text":"\n\nWe discuss the mass gap and the solution of the quark confinement problem in QCD. We review the general properties of the quark confinement problem and the standard approach to its solution. We then present a modification of the standard approach which enables one to study the dynamics of quark confinement in a systematic way. In particular, we show that the structure of the mass gap, in the limit of small quark masses, is determined by the structure of the confining potential. We then discuss the relationship between the mass gap and the solution of the quark confinement problem. We show that the solution of the quark confinement problem can be obtained as a limit of a certain integral as the quark mass tends to zero. We also show that the mass gap is related to the continuity of the induced quark momentum. We then discuss the physical implications of our results. In particular, we show that our results are consistent with the idea that the mass gap is related to the energy scale of the quark confinement process. We also show that our results suggest a possible explanation for the large mass gap observed in experiments."}
{"text":"\nMICS Asia Phase II - Sensitivity to the aerosol module.\n\nAerosol optical depth (AOD) is an important parameter in understanding aerosol processes and climate. In this work, the MICS Asia ( Measuring Instrument for Concentration and Size distributions in Asia ) instruments were deployed in Thailand, and sensitivity to the aerosol model used in the retrieval was investigated. We used two sets of ground-based observations: the measurements from the MICS-Asia instruments, and the results from a sun photometer of the same model, but with a different set of parameterizations. We found that the MICS-Asia retrieval was sensitive to the aerosol model used, particularly for the cases with very high aerosol optical depth (AOD). We further compared the results with the results from a regional aerosol model, and found that both the measurements and the model results were consistent with the assumption that the AOD in the MICS-Asia region was mainly determined by the aerosol processes in the upper troposphere. The results also showed that the AOD in the MICS-Asia region was slightly higher than the values obtained from the regional model, particularly for the high AOD cases. We attribute this to the model uncertainty in the aerosol processes in the upper troposphere. We further found that the MICS-Asia results were consistent with the regional model results in the relative contribution of the aerosol sources to the AOD in the MICS-Asia region. The results further suggested that the aerosol source apportionment was mainly determined by the aerosol processes in the upper troposphere."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present an analysis of the energy budgets of two recently discovered gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) with long duration: GRB 050410 and GRB 050412. These bursts are special because their total energy emissions are, respectively, 2.5 and 1.4 times the amount of energy that would be deposited by the energy fluence measured from their peak luminosity. We show that this discrepancy can be explained by a simple model in which the energy is deposited in a layer of uniform thickness surrounding the burst. This model can be used to estimate the total energy of the burst. We find that the total energy of GRB 050410 is about 6 \u00d7 1035 J and GRB 050412 is about 7 \u00d7 1035 J. These values are about one order of magnitude larger than the total energy of the next largest burst, GRB 00092. In addition, we show that a substantial fraction of the energy in these bursts was deposited in the first second of their lifetimes. This finding has important implications for the understanding of the energy budgets of GRBs."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a method for simultaneously deriving the temperature, mass, and age of evolved stars from high-resolution spectra. We show that the main evolutionary sequence (MS) turn-off point can be used to determine the stellar mass, the subgiant branch inflection point to estimate the stellar age, and the median radius of the star to derive its temperature. We apply our method to a sample of 22 field stars and the open cluster IC 4651, and we find that our estimates of stellar mass are in good agreement with those obtained from other independent methods. Our estimates of age and temperature are also consistent with expectations from other independent methods, except for the two stars in our sample that have already evolved to the red giant branch. We discuss the effect of non-LTE effects on the evolution of stellar spectral type, and we show that these effects are important for field stars but less so for cluster members. Our results suggest that high-resolution spectroscopy can provide valuable complementary information to that obtained from photometry, particularly for clusters."}
{"text":"\nWe propose a new interpretation of the PVLAS data based on the idea that the bulk viscosity and the bulk temperature are not well-defined quantities in general and that their definitions must be related to the state of the system as a whole. To this end, we define a new set of quantities which we call the \"flow variables\" and which can be related to the bulk viscosity and the bulk temperature in a well-defined way. The flow variables are shown to be related to the difference between the systemic variables and the microcanonical variables in a system with internal degrees of freedom, such as a granular material or a fluid with turbulent motions. In this sense, the flow variables have a more direct physical interpretation than the bulk viscosity and the bulk temperature. With this new set of variables, we are able to give a physical interpretation to the PVLAS data, and to reconcile the PVLAS data with the data from the LENS experiment. We also discuss the relationship between the flow variables and the Lagrangian and Eulerian descriptions of the flow, and we suggest that the flow variables can be useful to constrain the dynamics of a fluid or granular material, for example in the limit when the gravity is very weak or when the kinetic energy is dominant over the potential energy."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present here the first rigid-target analysis of the cosmic ray (CR) energy spectra in the knee region performed with the GAMMA experiment. The motivation for this analysis is twofold. First, we aim to investigate the energy spectra of primary and secondary cosmic rays in the energy region around the knee with high statistics and low background. The primary goal of GAMMA is to study the properties of hadronic showers in the energy region around the knee with excellent statistics and low background. The achieved statistics and background levels are such that a rigid-target analysis of the CR energy spectra in the knee region is now feasible. Second, we aim to test the predictions of different hadronic shower models in this energy region. We find that the experimental data are in reasonable agreement with the predictions of the Brain- biking shower model, especially if the hadrons are assumed to have a transverse momentum distribution that is broader than the one considered in the model. The differences between model predictions and the experimental data are larger if a narrower transverse momentum distribution is assumed."}
{"text":"\n\nThe Infrared Extinction Law at Extreme Depth in a Dark Cloud Core\n\nWe present an analysis of extinction towards the young stellar object $2MASS J2126$, which is embedded in a molecular cloud core at an estimated depth of $3-10pc$. We derive an extinction law in the $8-14 \\mu m$ wavelength range that is nearly independent of the optical depth, $\\tau$. We find that the extinction law in this range is well described by a power law with a single power of $-1.7 \\pm 0.2$, which implies that the extinction is due to a single opaque layer with a constant thickness. The obtained power law exponent is consistent with a slab with a thickness of order $1pc$. We show that the presence of such a layer can explain the unusually low extinction towards the object on the basis of a simplified radiative transfer model. The obtained extinction law is consistent with a cold, rather optically thick, slab that is situated at the edge of the cloud core, possibly a molecular boundary layer. Our results suggest that a significant fraction of the extinction in molecular clouds might be due to such thin, but optically thick, layers."}
{"text":"\n\nWe discuss effective actions for a class of coupled Einstein equations which includes the basic Einstein equations as a special case, and which includes theories with a cosmological constant, with a bulk viscosity, or with both. The effective actions are constructed using a renormalization group approach. We show that bulk viscosity introduces a second order derivative term in the effective action, which in general has an intrinsic value different from zero. This can be understood from the fact that the bulk viscosity term in the Einstein equations is a constraint, so that the effective action has to be obtained by an appropriate constrained optimization procedure. For the case with a cosmological constant the effective action can be obtained in a simpler way, but in this case as well there is a second order derivative term with an intrinsic value different from zero. The structure of the resulting effective actions is quite different for the case with bulk viscosity and for the case with a cosmological constant. We also discuss the bulk viscosity coupling constant in the effective action, and give an expression for its derivative with respect to the bulk viscosity parameter."}
{"text":"\nWe propose a new high-order accurate scheme for general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and magnetodynamics, based on the Eulerian approach and the conservation of the total derivative. We employ the high-order Euler method, which is robust and efficient, to advance the solution in time, and the restrictions to the total derivative conservation to control the evolution in space. The method is written in the framework of the chopped conservation laws approach, which allows an easy and straightforward implementation. This paper presents the method and several numerical tests to assess its performance. The good agreement with analytical solutions and previous numerical results, in different physical situations, demonstrates the reliability and the high order of accuracy of the method in a wide parameter range. The method is applicable to different systems, provided that the equations are invariant under the spatial variations of the fields. Hence, it can be straightforwardly extended to solve MHD and magnetodynamics problems in different spacetimes, like the Minkowski or the spherically symmetric spacetime, and in presence of a cosmological constant or other non-homogeneities."}
{"text":"\n\nWe investigate the problem of Coulomb drag in graphene, a problem which has been fundamentally important in the study of mesoscopic systems and which has also been proposed as a possible mechanism for energy conversion in nanostructured materials. We develop a theoretical model which is capable of describing the full range of experimental observations, from the drag force on a moving charge to the characteristics of the resulting induced current. We show that the drag force is proportional to the square of the charge velocity and that this proportionality is exact only for  301 \u00c5 < x < 400 \u00c5, where x is the distance between the charge and the nearest flaw in the graphene sheet. Our theory predicts a drag force which decreases rapidly as the charge approaches a flaw, in qualitative agreement with experiments. We also analyze the steady-state current induced in the graphene sheet by a moving charge, and find that it exhibits a peak at the flaw nearest to the charge. Our analysis provides a physical understanding of the experimental observations of  convict drag and offers a route for improving the performance of nanocircuitry and nanoelectromechanical systems which operate by moving charges through graphene."}
{"text":"\nWe consider a model of spherical nanoparticles (NPs) with a core-shell structure. The core is an ultradisperse silicon particle with a radius of the order of the Bohr radius. The shell is a Si\/SiGe quantum well with a thickness of several atomic layers, and the chemical composition is varied in a graded fashion. We find a good agreement of our results with the available experimental data. We also analyze the statistical properties of the NPs, such as the number distribution and the association equilibrium, in the framework of the model. The analysis of the size distribution is based on the ergodic assumption that the observed size distribution is in equilibrium. The assumption is valid if the NPs are capable of reaching a state of equilibrium, i.e., a state in which the number of NPs of each size is independent of the history of the system. We show that this condition is satisfied if the interaction between the NPs is only a weak size-dependent repulsion. We analyze the effects of the system parameters on the equilibration time and on the final size distribution. Our model may be useful to describe the equilibration of other systems of colloidal NPs, as long as the system parameters satisfy a set of generic conditions."}
{"text":"\nMultiple pattern matching: A Markov chain approach. We consider the problem of multiple pattern matching, i.e., given two or more patterns, find the positions at which they match to each other. We propose a general technique that combines dynamic programming with Markov chains to obtain an efficient solution to this problem. Our technique is based on the observation that the problem can be reformulated as a sequence alignment problem, which can then be recast as a Markov chain alignment problem. We show that this recast problem can be solved efficiently by a dynamic programming algorithm, based on the observation that the Markov chains of the two patterns to be matched have a certain structure that can be exploited by the dynamic programming algorithm. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm through a series of experiments, and show that it scales sublinearly in the number of patterns and that it is competitive with other multiple pattern matching algorithms in terms of execution time."}
{"text":"\nWe present here results of a systematic search for the optical counterpart of two bright transient sources discovered in the past year in archival data from the Chandra X-ray Observatory, one of which, the Supergiant Fast X-ray Transient (SFXT), is the brightest X-ray transient source ever found. We have conducted a visually intensive examination of the area surrounding the X-ray sources for the optical counterpart, using ~5,000 \u00d7 2,500 pixel images obtained with the Subaru and Keck II telescopes. We find no evidence of an optical counterpart. However, we do find a weakly variable optical source in the same Chandra tile, which we have observed with Keck II, that shows the same multi-color behaviour as the X-ray transient (see Figure). We present here a possible explanation for this surprising multi-color variability, in terms of a simple geometric model. Our results suggest that the phenomenon of supergiant X-ray transients may be a common behaviour for massive outbursts from very young stars, and not necessarily the signature of a unique class of objects."}
{"text":"\n\nCharacterization of P2P IPTV Traffic: Scaling Analysis\n\nWe present a characterization of P2P IPTV traffic, through an analysis of the traffic from a large-scale deployment of a popular P2P IPTV system, deploying a novel and efficient measurement infrastructure. We find that P2P IPTV traffic has similar characteristics to other P2P traffic, but with particular scaling properties. As the number of users increases, the number of content chunks requested increases, but the size of the requested chunks decreases. This chunk size decrease is accompanied by an increase in the number of chunks transmitted, which has an important impact on the scalability of the system. We analyze the chunk size selection process, and show that it is driven by a competition between two opposite tendencies: the desire to obtain a large chunk size, to minimize the overhead of each transmitted chunk, and the desire to obtain a small chunk size, to minimize the download time. The selection process is further complicated by the fact that the chunk size influences the number of chunks transmitted. We formalize this observation as a simple and general formula, which is validated by simulation. This formula can be used to analyze the evolution of the chunk size with the number of users, and also to compare different P2P IPTV systems."}

We find that both systems are well-behaved and stable on time scales of at least several decades. The masses of the companions are 37M\u2299 and 34M\u2299 for HD 37366 and HD 54662, respectively. Both systems are sufficiently well-behaved that they may be useful targets for long baseline optical interferometry. We derive orbital elements for both systems, and find that the orbits are not perfectly periodic. We discuss the physical properties of the stars and their companions, and the evolution of the systems. We find that both systems are likely to have evolved from the main sequence in a Helium-rich envelope, and thus both are likely to be magnetically-quiet Helium-burning stars. We discuss the prospects for detection of sub-stellar companions using both interferometry and high-resolution spectroscopy."}

We then generalize these results to the case of the higher homotopy group, and deduce that any Riemann surface has a unique conjugacy class in the higher homotopy group. This in turn allows us to regard the components of the moduli space of Riemann surfaces as absolute Galois representations. We then deduce a criterion for a representation to be realized as a component of the moduli space of Riemann surfaces, generalizing the Belyi-Galkavistch theorem to higher dimension.\n\nFinally, we consider the boundary components of the moduli space of smooth projective 3-folds, and show that any boundary component is isomorphic to a subspace of the relative symplectic group. As an application, we deduce a criterion for a representation to be realized as a boundary component of the moduli space of smooth projective 3-folds."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present XMM-Newton X-ray observations of the Wolf-Rayet binary system WR 147. These are the most sensitive X-ray observations of a WR binary to date, allowing a detailed study of the system in the energy range 0.3\u201310 keV. We find that the X-ray emission is described by a power law with a photon index of 1.7 \u00b1 0.1 and a Countdown peak energy of 4.2 keV. This power law represents the sum of two components, a high-energy power law (photon index 2.6 \u00b1 0.2) and a cut-off power law (photon index \u22120.6 \u00b1 0.1). The low-energy power law component dominates at energies below 2 keV, while the high-energy component is dominant above 2 keV. We model the observed X-ray emission from WR 147 with a two-temperature model, in which the low-energy power law component is thought to arise from the inner WR layer and the high-energy component from the accretion disc. We show that the observed X-ray flux is consistent with this model if the accretion disc is composed of hydrogen-poor material and the WR layer has a temperature of about 6 kK. We discuss the implications of our results for the chemical composition of the accretion disc and the structure of the inner WR layer."}
{"text":"\nA \"diamond-ring\" star: the unusual morphologic structure of a young (multiple?) object\n\nWe present observations of a young (ionic and gas) object, which we dub \"diamond-ring star,\" due to its unusual and very bright chromatic structure. We found it using the Wise star catalogue, which contains an all-sky survey at V=8. The unique thing about this object is that, unlike every other young stellar object, it does not show a point-like source, but a disk-like structure with many colours, and a structure that very much resembles the \" diamond-ring\" that some amateurs were lucky to observe during the total solar eclipse of August 21, 2017. The colours in our object are due to the fact that the light from the central star is First Order interference, while the light from the outskirts is Rayleigh scattering. We also found a companion object, which we initially dismissed as a background star, but it is also a young object, though much less bright and much more distant. It has a point-like structure, which could be a single star or a binary, and it is also surrounded by a disk-like structure with many colours, which could be an evolved version of the \"diamond-ring\" structure. We discuss the nature of these objects, and the possibility that the bright object may be a young multiple object, possibly a triplet. We also discuss the possibility that the bright object is a disk around a very young (and thus very large) giant planet, which would explain its unusual nature."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a detailed study of line emission in a sample of the brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) selected from the NOAO Fundamental Plane and Sloan Digital Sky Surveys. We use a principal component analysis to separate the different line components and decompose their contribution to the total line flux. We find that the BCGs are dominated by a strong metal line atrest wavelength, which we attribute to the ionization of the intergalactic medium by the hot intracluster gas. We show that this metal line component varies in a manner consistent with the variations in the gas temperature, and that it is an excellent tracer of the gas distribution. The temperature-ionization relationship inferred from the metal line is consistent with the prediction of the simple version of the Epstein-Jackson-Mueller model, but the high ionization states inferred for some clusters require a more sophisticated treatment. We also present a catalog of the ionizing sources in the clusters, and find that the sources are distributed in a manner consistent with a central cluster ionizing source and an outer ring of satellite sources. We discuss our results in the context of recent theoretical work on the Epstein-Jackson-Mueller model, and find that our data are consistent with a model in which the central ionizing source has a temperature several times higher than the satellite sources."}
{"text":"\nWe present an analysis of observations of the celestial pole offset (CPO) in the free core nutation frequency band, which is a fundamental and important tool in the study of the Earth's nutation. The observations are carried out as part of the International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF) experiment. The CPO is a small but non-zero offset between the Celestial Intermediate Reference Frame (CIRF) and the Celestial Reference Frame (CRF). The CPO observations are based on very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations of radio sources, which are chosen to be approximately symmetrically placed around the celestial pole. The observed CPO is determined from the time series of the VLBI observations as the relative displacement of the source pair along the baseline as the Earth rotates. We show that the CPO observations in the free core nutation frequency band are well-approximated by a sum of a cosine function and a square of a sine function of the time. The amplitude of the cosine function is found to be in good agreement with the theoretical value obtained from numerical integration of the equations of motion of the Earth, and the frequency of the sine function is found to be in good agreement with the theoretical frequency of the pendular motion of the Earth's core. The observation results suggest that the CPO observations in the free core nutation frequency band are sensitive to the nutation of the Earth's core."}
{"text":"\nWe present the results of a far-infrared dust continuum survey of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), aimed at assessing the relative masses of its giant molecular clouds (GMCs) by means of the dust-to-gas ratio. Our analysis benefits from the unique combination of high angular resolution and sensitivity provided by single-dish telescopes operating at millimeter wavelengths. We found that the dust-to-gas ratios of the SMC's main GMCs are, on average, 5-10% of the values found in the Milky Way's Galactic globular clusters. This result challenges the traditional assumption that these clouds are dominated by molecular hydrogen and suggests that a significant fraction of the gas in these clouds is in the form of dust. We discuss this result in the context of recent theoretical work that suggests a strong correlation between the mass of a molecular cloud and the rate at which it forms stars. Our findings suggest that the physical conditions that regulate the conversion of gas to dust may have a strong influence on the star formation rate in molecular clouds, potentially explaining the wide range of star formation rates observed in galactic and extragalactic molecular clouds."}
{"text":"\nWe consider the nearest-neighbor spacing distributions of the beta-Hermite ensemble of random matrices. The ensemble has been recently shown to have heavy tails in the distribution of the largest eigenvalue, with excess comparable to that of the irrational numbers. We show that the distribution of the nearest-neighbor spacing of the eigenvalues is also heavy-tailed. In particular, we show that it satisfies the conditions of a extreme value distribution with an infinite variance. The probability distribution of the first derivative of the nearest-neighbor spacing is also derived. The random matrices that make up the beta-Hermite ensemble have a wide range of applications in computer science, such as in numerical linear algebra, in the analysis of the spectrum of random unitary matrices, and in the study of the distribution of the singular values of random matrices. The results obtained in this paper are also applicable to the analysis of the nearest-neighbor spacing distribution of the spectrum of random unitary matrices."}
{"text":"\n\nAbstract\n\nWe present impedance spectroscopy measurements on epitaxial multiferroic thin films of (Bi0.5Na0.5)TiO3 and Pb(ZrxTi1-x)O3 (x = 0.44 and 0.55) grown on SrTiO3 and PbTiO3 substrates. We show that the capacitance of the films depends linearly on the applied frequency, in disagreement with the predictions of the standard theory of impedance spectroscopy for capacitance. We show that this effect is explained by a finite, frequency-dependent, equivalent serial resistance. We explain this behavior by a model in which the electric field in the capacitance is not uniform, but instead concentrated in a region close to the electrodes. We also show that the relaxation time of the system is in agreement with this model. Finally, we show that the capacitance increases with the number of layers in the film, in disagreement with the prediction of the standard theory, and that this effect is also explained by our model. We also discuss the influence of the substrate on the impedance spectroscopy."}
{"text":"\nWe previously demonstrated that normal mouse Schwann cells (SC) and the SC-like cells derived from the MDX mouse, a model for Duchenne's muscular dystrophy (DMD), have the ability to adhere to DP116, a protein of the extracellular matrix, through the dystroglycan (DG) receptor. In this study, we examined the effect of the processing of beta-dystroglycan on the DG-mediated adhesion to DP116. The alpha- and beta-dystroglycans (alpha- and beta-DG) are transmembrane proteins with several glycosylations necessary for their functions. We have shown that the alpha-DG is necessary for the adhesion of SC to DP116, while the beta-DG is dispensable in this process. In addition, we have shown that the beta-DG expressed by SC from MDX mice is improperly processed, lacks some of the glycans normally present in the beta-UG, and has an altered glycan composition. In this study, we show that this abnormal beta-DG is also present in SC membranes from normal mice. Moreover, we show that the level of beta-DG in SC membranes is increased in mice during the period of synaptic remodeling that occurs after peripheral nerve injury. We also show that this increased level of beta-DG is due to an increased expression of the beta-DG gene, and not due to an increased stability of the beta-DG protein. The results of this study suggest that, although the beta-DG is dispensable for the adhesion of SC to DP116, this protein may play an important role in the synaptic remodeling that occurs after peripheral nerve injury."}
{"text":"\n\nPre-main-sequence stars are a class of stars that are in the process of evolving from a collapsed cloud of gas and dust to a stable source of light and heat. As these stars evolve, they undergo a period of rapid rotation and activity, during which they can display phenomena such as solar flares and coronal mass ejections. The activity of pre-main-sequence stars is driven by the strong magnetic fields that are generated as the stars collapse and heat up.\n\nThe rotation and activity of pre-main-sequence stars is an important topic of study, as it can provide insight into the processes that occur during the evolution of stars. In addition, pre-main-sequence stars can have a significant impact on the evolution of their solar systems, as they can affect the evolution of planets and other celestial objects.\n\nIn this work, we present a theoretical study of the rotation and activity of pre-main-sequence stars. We consider the effects of various physical processes, such as convection and turbulence, on the rotation and activity of these stars. We find that the rotation and activity of pre-main-sequence stars can be highly variable, depending on the physical processes that are occurring within the stars.\n\nWe also consider the impact of the rotation and activity of pre-main-sequence stars on the evolution of their solar systems.

{"text":"\n\nWe present a catalog of 9,451 galaxies observed with the Hubble Space Telescope to measure the radial density profile of the lensing galaxies. The catalog consists of galaxies in five clusters and the field of the Hubble Deep Field, for a total volume of 1.56 h$^{-1}$ Mpc$^3$. We find that the radial density profile is well described by a power law with a power of -1.01 \u00b1 0.05. This is consistent with a constant density profile for the clusters, with the power law index increasing slightly with cluster virial radius. This is also consistent with a steep power law decline in the density profile for the field, with the power law index declining smoothly with radius. We compare the measured radial density profiles to the profiles predicted by lensing theory. We find that theory predicts a radial density profile that is in good agreement with the measured profile in the clusters, but that the field is under-dense by a factor of $\\sim$1.5 compared to the prediction of lensing theory. We discuss this discrepancy, and find that it can be explained by the fact that the actual density profile in the field is a superposition of a constant density profile (the dark matter distribution) and a declining density profile (the contribution of the intergalactic medium). We show that a fit to the measured data with a superposition of a constant density profile and a power law decline yields a good fit to the data, with no significant residuals. We also discuss the implications of this analysis for theories of the large-scale structure of the Universe."}
{"text":"\n\n2D Path Solutions from a Single Layer Excitable CNN Model\n\nThis work presents a new approach for generating two-dimensional (2D) paths that are solutions to a CNN model with an excitatory layer. We consider a very simple CNN architecture, where the only non-trivial layer is the last one, which is an excitatory layer with parameters that are trained to produce a suitable 2D path. We show that the resulting 2D paths are solutions to the CNN model. The main advantage of this approach is that it does not require any prior information about the solution paths, except for the fact that they are 2D. In addition, this approach is not limited to a specific 2D path, as long as the final layer is excitatory, and is applicable to any CNN architecture. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach on two examples: a CNN that is configured to generate 1D paths that are solutions to a single layer feedforward model, and a more complex CNN architecture that is configured to generate 2D paths that are solutions to a multilayer CNN model."}
{"text":"\nAtmospheric Dynamics of Short-period Extra Solar Gas Giant Planets I: Dependence of Night-Side Temperature on Opacity.\n\nWe have developed a new method for estimating the night-side temperature of extra-solar giant planets using the retrieval of atmospheres from limb-warming observations. Our method is based on a statistical relationship between the measured radius and temperature, which can be used to infer the temperature if the radius is known with sufficient accuracy. We apply this method to the extrasolar gas giants HD 209458 b, HD 189733 b, and HD 10180 f, which have equilibrium radii that can be measured with a precision of a few percent with current instruments. We find that the night-side temperatures are in the range from 1100 K to 1700 K, depending on the planet's optical depth. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that the observed giant exoplanets are relatively transparent and not feature a cloud layer. We also find that a model in which the gas giant atmosphere is treated as a uniform gas sphere with an additional term to represent the temperature-dependent radius can quantitatively reproduce our observations, providing a possible physical explanation for our findings. This model does not require a detailed microphysical treatment of the atmosphere, and therefore can be used to study a wide range of atmospheric compositions."}
{"text":"\n\nHadronization in semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering on nuclei.\nWe have studied the hadronization mechanism in the framework of the Standard Model (SM) in semi-inclusive deep-inelastic collisions between nuclei and relativistic heavy nuclei at high energies. The evolution of the hadron gas produced in these collisions is governed by the ductility of the nuclei, which is related to the nuclei' size, and by the energy distribution of the hadrons produced in the collisions. We have developed a formalism which describes the hadronization process in these collisions in a unified way, in the framework of the SM, and which takes into account the energy evolution of the hadrons as well as the ductility of the nuclei. Our results show that the hadronization process is different in the two cases, i.e. for relativistic heavy nuclei and for nuclei, and that the difference is due to the different mechanisms which have to saturate in the two cases. Our results also show that the hadron gas produced in these collisions is (ifi the collisions are \"hard\") always thermal, independently of the nucleus' size, and that the hadron gas produced in collisions between relativistic heavy nuclei is less likely to be turbulent than the one produced in collisions between nuclei."}
{"text":"\nWe present the results of a joint analysis of the constraints on neutrino mass and interactions from the latest Planck results, in the framework of a general purpose neutrino model that has previously been fitted to a large number of neutrino oscillation observations. We find that the Planck constraints can be accommodated within this model, given that the mass and the mixing angle are correlated in a way that is consistent with the absence of a phase transition in the early universe. The model that best fits the Planck constraints predicts a muon neutrino mass of 2.4 eV (68% confidence interval: 1.3-3.1 eV), in agreement with the current Planck determination of the neutrino mass. We show that the best-fit model contains two non-zero neutrino masses, with a maximum mass ratio of 1.5. We discuss the prospects of detecting such a mixture with current and future neutrino oscillation experiments, and place an upper bound on the probability of such a mixture for a range of neutrino mass values. We find that the best-fit model has a neutrino effective Dirac mass of 0.18 eV (68% confidence interval: 0.13-0.25 eV), consistent with the result from the Planck analysis of the galactic neutrino flux, and an order of magnitude larger than the Dirac mass of the down-type quark. We show that this order of magnitude difference in the Dirac masses is consistent with the idea that the active neutrinos are nearly massless, while the sterile neutrinos are massive, and that this is the simplest way to accommodate the Planck constraints."}
{"text":"\nWe propose a scheme of Feynman-Weinberg quantum gravity with the Extended Standard Model as a theory of everything, in which the fermionic generators are treated as a particular case of the general approach of the symmetric and antisymmetric components of a gravity field. In our scheme the symmetric part of the gravity field is responsible for the geometry of the spacetime, while the antisymmetric part is responsible for the structure of the matter fields. The spacetime is described by a dynamic triangular decomposition in the 3D-dimensional space, while the matter fields are described by a quadratic form in the 3D-dimensional space. We show that our scheme is equivalent to the well-known approach of the Ashtekar-Barlev-Corichi gravity model, in which the antisymmetric part of the gravity field is associated with the Standard Model. We discuss the relation to the other approaches to quantum gravity and the Extended Standard Model, and the question of the quantization of the bulk fields is discussed."}
{"text":"\nWe present here results of a systematic analysis of the data set obtained during the observation of the giant radio galaxy M87 by the radio telescope Pique-Assaut 2 (PA2) in 1997. These data have already been used to search for the presence of a supermassive black hole (SMBH) in the central region of M87. We found that the PA2 data set is also suitable to search for point sources in the very bright and complex central region of M87. We have found a total of nine point sources, eight of which are most likely to be identified with radio galaxies in the background. The ninth source, designated M87*, is very likely to be the SMBH in M87, if it exists. We have derived limits on the flux and energy distributions of M87* which can be explained by a SMBH with a mass in the range 2 \u00d7 109 \u2212 8 \u00d7 109 M\u2299 (68% confidence interval). We find that M87* is unlikely to be a SMBH with a mass > 3 \u00d7 1010 M\u2299. We also discuss a method to constrain the accretion rate of M87*, if it is a SMBH. We show that a recent model of the accretion process around a SMBH by Koelblein et al. allows for an explanation of the available data, if M87* has a mass in the range 2 \u00d7 109 \u2212 8 \u00d7 109 M\u2299."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present new data at 250 and 500 $\\mu$m from the SCUBA camera on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) of the COMA region, and an analysis of data at 1.4 $\\mu$m from the HST\/WFPC2. We show that the 250 and 500 $\\mu$m data are consistent with a large number of galaxies, and a smooth intergalactic medium, but the 1.4 $\\mu$m data are inconsistent with the simple cosmological model we have used to analyze the COMA data. We show that this discrepancy can be resolved by an analysis of the distribution of the galaxies in the region, which we present in the form of a probability distribution function. This indicates that the galaxies are not distributed according to a simple cosmology, but are more densely clustered on small scales, which is consistent with the fact that the 1.4 $\\mu$m data show a large number of galaxies in a small region. The COMA region contains a very high density of galaxies, and we present a statistical analysis of the number of galaxies per unit volume. We show that the distribution of galaxies is consistent with a simple cosmological model, but the distribution of intergalactic hydrogen is not. We present a model in which the intergalactic medium is represented by a series of flat slabs, and show that this model is consistent with the distribution of the galaxies.

{"text":"\n\nWe consider a class of games that arise in the analysis of cooperative transmission in wireless networks. These are coalition games with an odd number of players, in which the coalition formation is accompanied by a division of the transmission load among the coalition members. We show that the curse of boundary nodes, which plagues many selfish packet-forwarding wireless networks, can be cured by allowing the boundary nodes to cooperate in the transmission process. We show that this leads to a more efficient network, in terms of the cost-rate performance metric. We consider both the case where the transmission load is divided equally among the coalition members, and the case where the load is not equally divided, but is instead allocated in proportion to the residual capacity of the coalition members. We also consider the impact of a hybrid strategy, where a given node may cooperate with its neighbors on some links and yet still retain the ability to act selfishly on other links. We show that such a hybrid strategy can lead to a further improvement in the cost-rate performance metric."}

{"text":"\n\nAbstract for: ASTROD I Charging Simulation and Disturbances\n\nWe present a detailed analysis of the linear stability of different toroidal disturbances in tokamak plasmas with various degrees of turbulence. The analysis is based on the stability of a toroidal disturbance with a given wavelength and a given growth rate as a function of the ratio between the magnitude of the toroidal electric field and the magnitude of the toroidal moment of the plasma. Two different methods are used to evaluate the growth rate: (i) the Grad-Shafranov method, and (ii) the method of characteristic finite amplitude toroidal disturbances. The obtained growth rates are compared to the linear growth rate of the same disturbance in a turbulence free plasma and in a fully developed turbulence. The results show that the growth rate is reduced by the presence of turbulence in the plasma, except for a range of electric field magnitudes for which the growth rate is increased by the presence of turbulence. The reason for this exception is that in this range the plasma is less stable to the toroidal disturbance than a turbulence free plasma, and thus the presence of turbulence increases the growth rate. For higher values of the electric field the growth rate is reduced, because the disturbance becomes more stable to the presence of turbulence."}
{"text":"\nWe study the orbital magnetization in spin-chiral ferromagnets. We find that the orbital magnetization has a threshold dependence on the magnitude of the magnetic field and the spiraling direction of the spin-chiral structure below the threshold. This is in strong contrast to the usual orbital magnetization in non-chiral materials, where the dependence on the spiraling direction is very small. We explain this contrast by the different competition between the orbital and the spin degrees of freedom in the two cases. In addition, the orbital magnetization in the chiral case shows a clear signature of the spiral symmetry of the spin-chiral structure, which is absent in the non-chiral case. We also find that the orbital magnetization in the chiral case is proportional to the square of the magneto-mechanical coupling constant, while it is proportional to the magneto-mechanical coupling constant in the non-chiral case. We explain this difference by the different dependence on the frustration of the two cases. Our results suggest that the orbital magnetization in chiral materials can be precisely controlled by an external magnetic field, which may have important applications in spintronic devices."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a new method for identifying stragglers in round-trip data streams based on Newton's identities and invertible Bloom filters. The method is motivated by the observation that when a message is delayed due to a straggler, the resulting sequence of messages forms a linear dependence over the original field. By using this linear dependence to extract the straggler, we are able to identify the straggler in the presence of any field- independent probabilistic adversary that can create (unidirectional) data dependencies. We show that the key idea of our method is to use a \"straggler-oriented\" Newton identity that does not preserve the field-independent structure induced by the straggler. Our technique is robust to stragglers that act as a combination of a field-dependent and field-independent adversary. We also show that our method is more efficient than existing techniques that use only field-independent Newton identities. Finally, we show that our method can be used to identify stragglers in the context of application-level protocols, where the data is opaque."}
{"text":"\nWe propose a generic mechanism for adaptive growth rate regulation based on environmental measurement and internal feedback. We show that a suitable internal feedback loop can be constructed for any element of an environmental input space, enabling growth to be regulated adaptively in any environment. We analyze the performance of such a mechanism by constructing a family of toy models, where the toy models have different parameter values for their internal feedback loop, but where the structure of the feedback loop is otherwise identical for all toy models. We show that the toy models exhibit different growth rates, which can be explained by a simple analysis of the internal feedback loop. Our analysis also shows that the growth rate is generally non-monotonic as a function of the environmental input, even for cases where the growth rate is known to be monotonic as a function of the environmental input. We propose that this non-monotonic behavior is a general feature of adaptive growth rate regulation. We also propose that the observed behavior can be understood from a simple analysis of the internal feedback loop, which can be used to design a desired growth rate regulation."}
{"text":"\nWe have investigated the charge and spin stripe order in La$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$NiO$_{4}$ (x=1\/3,1\/2) by means of temperature dependent DC resistivity and AC magnetic susceptibility measurements. In the constant magnetic field swept temperature experiment, the resistivity showed a clear transition to the non-zero value at the ordering temperature, and the temperature derivative of the resistivity, i.e. the thermal coefficient of resistivity, exhibited a positive sign over a wide temperature range which is consistent with the s-wave antiferromagnetic spin order. By using a spin filter material, the coexistence of the charge and spin order was confirmed by means of a neutron diffraction experiment. From the temperature dependent DC resistivity measurements in a magnetic field, the charge and spin ordering temperatures were found to be different, but both temperatures were around 100 K. We also found that the spin ordering temperature was suppressed to a temperature several tens of K lower than the charge ordering temperature by applying a hydrostatic pressure on the sample. These results indicate the existence of a spin and charge competition for the formation of a stripe structure."}
{"text":"\nWe derive effective interactions in dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) for a class of simple active particles that have a single degree of freedom that can move in a shallow potential well. The derivation is based on the principle of detailed balance and makes use of the formalism of the master equation for the particles' probability distribution. In the case of a harmonic potential, the effective interaction is shown to reduce to a pairwise one, with a range that depends on the depth of the potential well. In particular, this range is shown to be a function of the particle's relaxation time, which itself depends on the depth of the potential well. The effective interaction is also shown to exhibit a certain degree of universality, in that it does not depend on the particular form of the potential well. As an example application, we consider the statistical mechanics of a system of active particles with a range-dependent effective interaction, and show that the system has a non-zero fraction of equilibrium states with an infinite number of particles. This fraction is shown to increase with the particle's relaxation time."}

{"text":"\nWe present constraints on the self-enrichment scenario for light nuclei in galactic globular clusters from nucleosynthesis. We consider the chemical evolution of the cluster as a function of the cluster's age and the primordial abundance of the light nuclei. We find that the enrichment process is very fast at the beginning, but that the cluster is still able to retain the signature of its primordial abundance, despite having a different overall composition. This is because the relative abundances of the light nuclei are very well conserved during the evolution of the cluster. The main sinks of the light nuclei are the formation of heavy nuclei and the ejection of the cluster's gas. We also show that the difference between the cluster's primordial and current abundances has a different origin for each light nucleus, and that this origin is related to the size of the clusters. Our results are consistent with the chemical evolution of the clusters being mainly governed by the relative abundances of the light nuclei, and not by the absolute abundances of these nuclei."}
{"text":"\n\nWe revisit the effect of nearby supernova (SN) remnants on local cosmic rays (CRs) by analyzing a sample of 51 SN remnants within 50 pc of the Sun and 28 SN events that occurred within 1 kpc of the Sun during the last several million years. We show that the local excess of CRs over the background, as measured by the CR index, is significantly correlated with the rate of SN events within 1 kpc, but is not correlated with the number of nearby SN remnants. This suggests that the local CR excess is due to a combination of the interplanetary transport of CRs from old SN events and the recent termination of the CR injection from nearby SN remnants, but is not due to the continued injection of CRs from these SN remnants. We find that the local CR excess is best described by a power law with an index of 1.89 \u00b1 0.01. This is consistent with a simple model in which the local CR excess is due to a combination of the interplanetary transport of CRs from old SN events and the recent termination of the CR injection from nearby SN remnants, and in which the power law index is determined only by the history of SN events within 1 kpc."}
{"text":"\nWe present long-term photometric observations of RR Geminorum II obtained with the 1-m f\/2.15 Schmidt telescope at the Special Astrophysical Observatory of the Russian Academy of Sciences. We find that the photometric behaviour of the star in the V band is well described by a sum of two sinusoidal functions with frequencies of 1.53 and 1.55 cycles per day, with the phase of the 1.53-Hz signal shifted by -0.48 cycles with respect to that of the 1.55-Hz signal. We show that these frequencies are almost identical to the 1.54-Hz Blazhko and 1.52-Hz non-radial gravity-wave signals that have been detected in many low-mass red giants. We therefore conclude that the photometric modulation seen in RR Geminorum II is due to the gravitational influence of one or more giant planets. We find that the relative amplitude of the 1.53-Hz and 1.55-Hz signals is constant, which means that the ratio of the two frequencies is also constant. Hence, the long-term photometric behaviour of RR Geminorum II can be used to probe the interaction between a giant planet and its parent star."}
{"text":"\nWe consider the statistics of the points where Nodal Lines, which are families of lines that intersect a given Reference Curve (RC) in a prescribed manner, intersect the RC.

Further analysis shows that the distribution of the points is the same for all Nodal Lines that intersect the RC in the prescribed manner, and hence, the statistics of the points are independent of the particular Nodal Lines chosen. We also derive a simple expression for the variance of the number of points in terms of the parameters of the Nodal Lines and the RC. Our results can be used to test the hypothesis that the points where a given Nodal Line intersect the RC are uniformly distributed along the RC. As an application, we consider the problem of selecting the optimal Nodal Lines to intersect a RC in a way that minimizes the number of points, while at the same time satisfying certain constraints on the Nodal Lines."}

{"text":"\n\nIntroduction\nThis article presents a new approach to the prevention of dental caries in patients withperiodontitis. The motivation for this research stems from the fact that dental caries is still  a major public health problem, despite the introduction of fluoride toothpaste and the practice of dental scaling. Our aim was to determine the effect of electrosuggestive stimulation of the lingual nerve on the formation of dental plaque and caries. The method used was a controlled clinical trial in which patients with periodontitis were randomly allocated to two groups: one group received electrosuggestive stimulation of the lingual nerve and the other group (control group) received a placebo. The results showed that electrosuggestive stimulation of the lingual nerve significantly reduced the formation of dental plaque and caries, compared to the control group. The mechanism of action of electrosuggestive stimulation is probably related to the increase in saliva production and the reduction of the acid pH in the oral cavity.\n\nConclusion\nElectrosuggestive stimulation of the lingual nerve is an effective method for the prevention of dental caries in patients with periodontitis. The results of this study suggest that electrosuggestive stimulation may be a useful tool in the prevention of dental caries. However, further research is needed to confirm the effectiveness of this method and to investigate the underlying mechanism."}
{"text":"\nWe present photometric and spectroscopic observations of the rich star cluster NGC 1846 in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Our main result is the detection of a double main sequence turn-off in the cluster. The main sequence in stellar clusters is defined by the relationship between the spectral type and the effective temperature of a star. The main sequence turn-off (MSTO) is the point where the most massive stars become too hot to produce hydrogen fusion in their cores and are therefore no longer on the main sequence. These very massive stars then become supergiants. We found a significant overabundance of massive supergiant stars in NGC 1846. The cluster is young, so the massive stars are still in the main sequence. Therefore, the MSTO must have been reached recently, which implies that the massive stars have been burning for a shorter time than the lower mass stars. The observed MSTO, together with the cluster's young age, therefore suggests a two-fold process of star formation in NGC 1846: first the low-mass stars formed, and then the massive stars formed later.

The WL method efficiently explores the low-energy region of the potential energy function by a biased random walk in theMD Lagrangian. We show that the WL algorithm can be applied to proteins by using the Amber force field, and that it efficiently samples the low-energy conformational space, in a manner that is complementary to conventional MD. The WL-MD method is demonstrated on two different proteins: the Neut-']. protein and the Adenylate kinase (AdK) protein. For the first one, the method is used to verify the existence of a previously predicted low-energy structure, and for the second one the method is used to screen the conformational space in order to find low-energy structures that have not been found before. The results show that the WL-MD method is a powerful tool to search for low-energy conformations of macromolecules."}
{"text":"\nWe present a search for gravitational waves from inspiraling binary black holes in the first advanced LIGO observing runs, O1 and O2. We use an improved version of the search method employed by the LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC) in their search for binary black hole mergers in the first two LIGO observing runs, S1 and S2. We find no evidence of gravitational waves from binary black holes in O1 and O2. We place the most stringent upper limit on the binary black hole merger rate to date, at $3.5 \\times 10^{-24} Mpc^{-3}$ gravitational waves emitted per second, at the confidence level of $3 \\sigma$. We find that in O1 and O2 the chance of detecting a gravitational wave from a randomly positioned binary black hole is $3 \\times 10^{-25}$, at the confidence level of $3 \\sigma$. We show that if a binary black hole were to inspirate in the LIGO detector's band, it would produce more than 1000 events in the time period of O1 and O2, which we observe to have had no such events. We conclude that in O1 and O2, black hole binaries do not exist within the LIGO band, with a confidence level of $3 \\sigma$."}
{"text":"\n\nWe give a simple derivation of the zoom-in power law for the three-point function in a background spacetime described by a general relativistic cosmological model with a positive cosmological constant and a symmetric non-standard fatality function. We show that the topology of the spatial slices has a strong influence on the shape of the three-point function, and that in certain situations the three-point function can have power-law behavior even if the two-point function is universal. We show further that the zoom-in power law can be obtained by a simple argument which does not involve the definition of the K-function, provided that the limit in which the three-point function is evaluated is carefully chosen. This argument is based on the consideration of the topology of the spatial slices and on the observation that the three-point function can be obtained by integrating the two-point function with respect to the spatial variables. We also give a simple derivation of the six-point function in a general relativistic cosmological model with a positive cosmological constant and a symmetric non-standard fatality function."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present here the first study of the large-scale structure of the red galaxy (RG) halo population in the SDSS using the halo model. We identified 27,351 galaxies with photometric redshifts in the SDSS DR7 catalog of luminous RGs with Mrk > -18.5, a selected group which has the same properties as the optically-selected halo RGs but with a significantly higher number of galaxies, enabling a more robust analysis of the large-scale structure. We find that the galaxies in this sample follow the halo model very well, with the projected density distribution in very good agreement with the predictions of the model, and the corresponding spherical halo profiles are consistent with those obtained in previous studies of optically-selected RGs. We find no evidence of a core in the projected density distribution, in agreement with previous results for optically-selected RGs, and we obtain a scaling length of $h \\sim 250$ kpc. The number density profile follows the halo model with a core, and we find that the Virial Theorem is satisfied with a Virial ratio of $\\sim 2.1$. We find that the bulk of the population is comprised of galaxies in groups, and that only a small fraction of the population is comprised of galaxies in the large voids; this fraction is consistent with the predictions of the model. We also present a catalog of 9,302 optically-selected RGs with Mrk > -18.5 in the same redshift range as the photometric RGs, and find that the photometric and optically-selected samples have very similar properties, in agreement with the predictions of the halo model. We conclude that the halo model successfully describes the large-scale structure of the SDSS luminous RGs in this redshift range."}
{"text":"\n\nStudies of the temperature and frequency dependent impedance of an electroceramic functional oxide thermistor.\n\nWe report on thermistor characterization studies carried out on bulk nanostructured CeO\u2082-based functional oxide thermistors with different microstructures, which have been produced by pressure- assisted sintering of nanocrystalline powders. The temperature dependent impedance (Z(T)) of these thermistors was measured with an ac impedance spectrometer in the frequency range 1 Hz\u2013100 kHz, and the data were analyzed using an equivalent circuit model. The main contributions to the thermistor impedance were found to be a constant phase element (CPE) representing the grain boundary resistance and capacitance, and a variable phase element (VPE) representing the temperature dependent resistance and capacitance of the bulk. The parameters of the VPE were extracted from the impedance data, and were found to be in good agreement with the temperature dependent resistance and capacitance obtained from the DC measurements. Furthermore, the CPE was also extracted, and the value of the capacitance was found to be consistent with the result from DC measurements. Finally, the frequency dependence of the impedance was studied, and the extracted capacitance and resistance were found to be frequency independent, in good agreement with the DC results. These results show that the ac impedance technique can be successfully used to characterize thermistors, and the extracted parameters can be related to the DC measurements and the microstructure of the samples."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present the first results from a systematic study of the evolution of matter and motion in the Local Volume, based on constrained simulations with the Taaffe simulation code, on a set of ~40 million CPU hours on TeraGrid resources. We consider the evolution of the mass and motion in the Local Volume, focusing on the growth of structure on small scales (comoving scales less than 5 h$^{-1}$ Mpc) and the correlation between matter and motion. We find that the large-scale structure in the Local Volume has many of the same statistical properties as the large-scale structure in the universe at large, such as the power law decline in the correlation function and the increasingly exponential decline with scale. We also find that the correlation between matter and motion is very tight on large scales, but breaks down on small scales, with a correlation length that decreases with radius in a way consistent with the sound-wave approximation. We discuss these results in the context of the current theories of structure formation in the Local Volume, and find that our results are consistent with the idea that large-scale structure forms through a gravitational instability that is largely insensitive to the detailed distribution of matter, and that small-scale structure forms through a process of resonance that depends sensitively on the detailed distribution of matter."}
{"text":"\n\nLifetime Improvement in Wireless Sensor Networks via Collaborative Beamforming and Cooperative Transmission\n\nIn this work, we study cooperative communication in wireless sensor networks. We propose a general framework that comprises two key techniques: collaborative beamforming and cooperative transmission. We derive a game-theoretic framework to capture the essence of the proposed cooperative communication scheme. We obtain a near- optimality of the proposed scheme by showing that the framework achieves a competitive ratio of 1, which means that the proposed scheme is within a constant factor of the optimal scheme, which is independent of the number of nodes. This is an improvement over the usual non-cooperative communication scheme, which becomes computationally expensive as the number of nodes increases. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that derives a game-theoretic framework for collaborative communication in wireless sensor networks. The proposed framework is general and can be used to improve the lifetime of any sensor network application. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework via simulation results."}
{"text":"\nWe propose a new Stochastic Process associated to the Entropy Penalized Method (EPM), which is a tool for the analysis of financial time series that has been recently introduced in the literature. The new process, called the Stochastic Process associated to the EPM (SP-EPM), is derived from the properties of the EPM. The SP-EPM has a dynamic that is analogous to the Dynamic of the Stochastic Process associated to the Kalman Filter (SP-KF), which is the basis of the well-known Kalman-filtering technique. In particular, the SP-EPM has a correlation function that decays exponentially as the time interval between the two variables to be correlated increases. We show that this is a general property of the SP-EPM, by means of an approximation that allows us to derive the SP-EPM in the case of small datasets. As an application, we show that the SP-EPM can be used to analyze financial time series in which the underlying process is not linear, by means of an approximation that allows us to linearize the SP-EPM."}
{"text":"\nWe present a new model for the description of the energy dependencies of high-frequency quasinormal modes (QNMs) in black hole X-ray binaries. The model is based on the consideration of the equal-frequency contours in the portrait of the integrable contact interaction kernel. The model provides an explanation for the observed energy dependences of QNMs in terms of the non-monotonic structure of the integrable kernel and the related concentration of the coherent energy flux in the low-frequency region. The practical use of the model is illustrated by application to the analysis of the energy dependences of the QNMs in the black hole X-ray binaries HS 1700+1458 and 4U 1705-44. \n\nWe find that in both cases the low-frequency QNMs dominate the high-frequency QNMs and the concentrations of the coherent energy flux in the low-frequency region are in good agreement with the model expectations. In addition, the model provides an explanation for the observed ''hole punching'' effect in the energy distribution of QNMs. We also discuss the relevance of the model for the description of the energy dependences of QNMs in electromagneticarkers and X-ray sources in general."}
{"text":"\n\n Lifetime Improvement of Wireless Sensor Networks by Collaborative Beamforming and Cooperative Transmission. Wireless sensor networks have many applications in monitoring, tracking and controlling the systems in various fields. In this paper, we study the lifetime of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) using collaborative beamforming and cooperative transmission techniques. We consider the energy efficiency as a performance metric to improve the lifetime of WSNs. The conventional multi-hop WSNs suffer from the overhearing problem, which causes the energy consumption to increase rapidly. To address this problem, we propose a novel collaborative beamforming scheme that enables the nodes to overhear the least possible number of transmissions. We then further improve the lifetime of the network by allowing the nodes to use the multi-hop cooperative transmission technique. We analyze the proposed schemes via simulation and show that the collaborative beamforming and cooperative transmission techniques can significantly improve the lifetime of WSNs."}

We show that a multiuser detection scheme using two-stage interference cancellation is feasible for the downlink in the proposed cooperative communication protocols. We also propose a practical network coding scheme for the uplink in the proposed cooperative communication protocols. Our proposed protocols are analyzed by computer simulations. The results show that the proposed protocols achieve a spectral efficiency of $4.4bits\/Hz\/node$ and a diversity order of $8.6$ in the downlink and a spectral efficiency of $1.8bits\/Hz\/node$ and a diversity order of $8.0$ in the uplink, which are close to the theoretical limits."}
{"text":"\nWe consider the production of sparticles (i.e. lighter counterparts of the standard model quarks and charged leptons) in the framework of large volume string compactifications. In particular, we consider the sparticle spectra which can be generated by wrapping D-branes at different dimensions around a compactification of the large volume string. We find that a significant number of sparticles can be generated, and their masses can be as small as the tree level masses of the standard model quarks and charged leptons. In addition, we find that the produced sparticles can be grouped into several generations, and that the number of generations can be as large as three. We also discuss the production mechanism of the sparticles, and find that the large volume string has the potential to produce sparticles in a large mass range, and in large numbers. Furthermore, we discuss the LHC signatures for the large volume string compactifications, and find that the LHC can potentially see the signatures for a large volume string which is wrapped around a compactification of large radius."}
{"text":"\n\nEstimation Diversity and Energy Efficiency in Distributed Sensing\n\nThis paper considers the problem of estimating a set of parameters from distributed measurements. The parameters may be constant values, linear or nonlinear functions of the measurements, or the solution of a nonlinear system of equations. The paper focuses on the diversity of the estimation method, which is the degree to which the method provides different estimates from different combinations of the measurements. The diversity of an estimation method is important because it determines the resilience of the method to sensor failures, and because it provides a way of combining sensors with different measurement ranges. The paper considers two classes of estimation methods, specifically, the class of estimation methods that use the measurements directly, and the class of methods that first compute a transformation of the measurements and then use the transformed measurements to estimate the parameters. Within each class, the paper develops an algorithm for finding the method that is most resilient to sensor failures, and then uses the algorithm to find the method that has the highest energy efficiency. The paper analyzes the effect that the structure of the parameter set has on the diversity and energy efficiency of the estimation method. In particular, the paper shows that the diversity and energy efficiency achieve their highest values when the parameters are linear or quadratic functions of the measurements."}
{"text":"\n\nWe investigate the propagation of external regulation and asynchronous dynamics in random Boolean networks. We find that the average activity of a large class of networks displays a critical threshold for the input magnitude required to drive the network into a synchronous state. Below this threshold, the average activity remains constant, while above it, the activity shows slow-downs and synchronization. We show analytically and confirm numerically that the critical threshold is related to the average connectivity and the correlation between the input and the output activities. Our results suggest that the asynchronous dynamics is intrinsically more stable than perfect synchronization, and thus a priori expected to be more robust against changes in the connectivity or the inputs. We also show that a simple extension of the analysis of random Boolean networks can be used to study the interplay between the input and the output dynamics on a large class of regular networks. Our results for random and regular Boolean networks suggest that the external regulation of asynchronous dynamics is more robust and efficient than perfect synchronization, which is important for various practical applications such as gene regulation and signal processing."}

{"text":"\n\nWe investigate the impact of timing jitter on the performance of an impulse radio ultra-wideband (IR-UWB) system in a multipath environment. We show that the timing jitter has a negative impact on the bit error rate (BER) and the packet error rate (PER) when the channel is influenced by strong multipath reflections. In particular, for a given impulse position modulation (IPM) symbol duration, we show that the timing jitter can cause interferences between the multipath components, leading to an increase in the BER and PER. To quantify this effect, we propose a metric called the processing gain penalty due to timing jitter (PGPT). We show that the PGPT can be used to predict the performance of an IR-UWB system in the presence of timing jitter, and we provide a simple expression for the PGPT in the case of a single-tone carrier. We also investigate the impact of timing jitter on the performance of an IR-UWB system in the presence of narrowband interference (NBI). We show that the timing jitter can cause the NBI to move in time, leading to an increase in the BER and PER.

{"text":"\nWe investigate the dynamics of a weakly nonlinear compressible flow in a heterogeneous isotropic plasma. Our study is motivated by the fact that such flows are relevant to many physical systems, including ionised gases, plasmas, stellar winds, and radiative transfer in general. We consider the simplest case of a two-dimensional flow in a uniform plasma with a layer of much higher conductivity at the bottom. Our focus is on the effect of the Conductivity Anisotropy Ratio (CAR) on the velocity distribution and the evolution of small-scale structures. We find that the flow is stable against vertical displacement of the fluid, which may be treated as a small perturbation. We also find that the large-scale structure is influenced by the anisotropy of the conductivity and that the small-scale structures are slightly affected by the CAR, except for a transition region at the top of the highly conductive layer, where they become unstable against vertical displacement and break up. We have investigated this effect by means of Zakharov simulations in a two-dimensional mesh with fine resolution in the vertical direction."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a new and elementary proof of Pappus's theorem, namely that any Pappus system (a system of three circles in general position in the plane such that all three circles are orthogonal to each other) is equivalent to the orthogonal projection of a certain tetrahedron on the plane. Our proof does not use the tools of projective geometry, as do all previous proofs, but proceeds by establishing a one-to-one correspondence between Pappus systems and certain \"off-center\" equilateral triangles. We show that any Pappus system can be obtained from such an \"off-center\" equilateral triangle by a sequence of reflections and rotations, and that this sequence has the same effect on the equilateral triangle as does the orthogonal projection of a tetrahedron onto the plane. Our proof is based on the properties of reflections in circles and on the observation that four reflections in circles, or equivalently, four orthogonal projections of a tetrahedron onto the plane, can be obtained by means of a single isometric reflection in the plane."}
{"text":"\nWe propose and analyze a new method for precision measurements of atomic helium based on direct frequency comb spectroscopy. The method does not require the atoms to be slowed down or the light to be pulsed, and therefore it has the potential for much higher precision than the conventional methods based on optical molasses or frequency-modulated spectroscopy. We evaluate the feasibility of the method by comparing it with the conventional methods, and we analyze the influence of the various parameters on the precision that can be achieved. We show that with current technology it is possible to reach a few parts in 1011 already, and that with technology that is expected to be available in the near future a precision of a few parts in 1012 should be achievable. We also show that by using a cavity to accumulate the atoms it is possible to increase the number of atoms in the measurement by a factor of several thousand, which will bring the precision to the level of the conventional methods."}
{"text":"\nWe present radio continuum observations of galaxies in nine superclusters in the Southern Hemisphere. The radio galaxies show a large range of radio power, but no correlation with optical or IR properties. We find that the radio source galaxies in superclusters have on average higher radio power than galaxies in control samples of clusters and voids, but the difference is only significant at >1 kpc. We show this to be consistent with the superclusters containing more powerful radio galaxies, even at high redshift, and that this is likely due to the galaxies being in mergers. We conclude that the main process in generating radio galaxies in superclusters is the same as in clusters, except that in the case of superclusters the dominant effect is at larger scales and over larger volumes, and hence is less efficient in converting cluster kinetic energy into radio power. We discuss this in terms of the mean free path of the plasma, which is much shorter in clusters than in superclusters. We also find that the host galaxies of the most powerful radio galaxies in the superclusters are themselves optically and IR-quiet, and thus are likely to be dominated by merging phenomena."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate the minimal number of sensors of a sensor network that are needed to achieve a given sensing capacity. Our interest is in the case of linear observation models, where the observation vector has a linear relationship with the underlying phenomenon, and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is fixed. We show that if the sensors are deployed randomly, the minimal number of sensors is equivalent to the guessing number of the random model. We then derive a closed-form expression for the minimal number of sensors in terms of the SNR and the parameters of the observation model. Our derivation is based on a combination of probability theory and linear algebra. We show that the minimal number of sensors is upper-bounded by the rank of the observation model. This bound can be tight if the SNR is sufficiently large. We further show that if the observation model is a strict linear model, i.e., the noise is orthogonal to the signal space, then the minimal number of sensors is equal to the rank of the observation model. Our results provide a theoretical foundation for the design of sensor networks that are used for linear observation models, where the SNR is fixed."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate mesoscopic fluctuations of the supercurrent in diffusive Josephson junctions. We show that such fluctuations are governed by a large number of different branches of the supercurrent, which follow different paths through the diffusive mesh. We find that the standard deviation of the supercurrent is inversely proportional to the diffusion coefficient, in agreement with the prediction of the fluctuating lake model. In a second set of experiments, we investigate the dynamics of the supercurrent, in particular the relaxation time of the supercurrent amplitude and the response to an external field. Our results are consistent with a supercurrent diffusion model and disfavor a hopping or step-like dynamics. The relaxation time is found to be inversely proportional to the supercurrent amplitude, which is consistent with the relaxation being due to thermal activation of the supercurrent and to a finite off-state probability. Our results suggest that in diffusive Josephson junctions the supercurrent is governed by local thermally activated events, on a characteristic time scale that is much longer than the intrinsic Josephson oscillation period."}
{"text":"\nWe present photometric and spectroscopic observations of 38 single stars in the remote Leo II dwarf spheroidal galaxy. We find that their kinematics can be described by a two-component model in which the radial velocity increases monotonically from the core to the outer regions of the galaxy. The velocity dispersion of these outer stars is 11 km s^-1, four times larger than the core value. We show that a simple model in which the stars are affected by a radial viscosity profile can quantitatively reproduce the kinematics of both components. In this model the viscous force increases linearly with the radial distance. The model parameters are consistent with a Newtonian potential well with a depth of 4 km s^-1 and a scale-length of 1.5 kpc. The fact that both components are well described by the same model suggests that they are not dynamically distinct, but rather that the kinematics of the outer component arises directly from the global potential field. We discuss the implications of this result for models of galaxy formation in which the smooth component of the kinematics of satellite galaxies is invoked to cool and collapse the main galaxy, potentially forming a bar."}
{"text":"\n\nWe find that a black-body model can successfully describe the non-Fluke spectrum of a Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) if the burst has a spectral index that is generally greater than -1. This result is consistent with a simple physical model in which the black-body radiation is due to thermal re-radiation from the photosphere, and the cut-off power-law component is due to simple geometric effects. We have derived a simple analytic expression for the cut-off power-law component in terms of the black-body temperature, the burst's spectral index, and a parameter which represents the geometric truncation of the spectrum. We find that this parameter has a value between 1 and 2 for all observed GRBs, and take this to be an indication that the emission region has a generally Gaussian size distribution. This has implications for models in which the burst emission region is tightly coupled to the surrounding accretion disc. We show that a simple black-body model can provide a good description of the observed GRB spectra without the need to invoke either a fluke component or a cut-off power-law component, and discuss the implications of this for the physical models of GRB emission regions."}
{"text":"\nWe introduce the symmetric heavy-light ansatz for a class of symmetric constrained optimization problems with an unknown but symmetric feasible set. The symmetric heavy-light ansatz is based on a proper alteration of the well-known heavy-light ansatz for symmetric cones.

Furthermore, the symmetric heavy-light ansatz always generates a symmetric optimal solution, even if the original optimization problem is not symmetric. The symmetric heavy-light ansatz is proven to be equivalent to a certain kind of Lagrange multiplier for symmetric cones. As a result, the theory of Lagrange multiplier methods for symmetric cones can be applied to derive new symmetry conditions for optimization problems with an unknown but symmetric feasible set.

{"text":"\nWe consider the phase ordering kinetics of the s=1 spinor condensate in a model with a tunable nonlinear coupling to a second degree of freedom. The model is inspired by recent experiments on the dynamics of spin-ice magnets, which have a strong dependence on the direction of the applied field. We find that the nonlinear coupling can have a strong effect on the dynamics of the spinor condensate, in particular on the transition between the antiferromagnetic and the isotropic phases. In particular, we find a novel type of phase ordering kinetics, which we call burst-switching, where the system is able to switch very quickly between the antiferromagnetic and the isotropic phases. The appearance of this effect is related to the presence of a large second order parameter in the system. In the case where the phase transition is driven by an external field, we show that the dynamics is governed by a set of ordinary differential equations, which can be solved analytically. We also discuss the case where the system is driven by a periodically modulated field. In this case the system can be shown to be in a so-called quasi-deterministic state, where the probability distribution is constant in time, and the dynamics is described by a set of differential equations with constant coefficients. The appearance of this quasi-deterministic state is related to the fact that the periodically modulated field induces a periodic variation of the second order parameter in the system."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a statistical analysis of the orientations of satellite galaxies (SG) within their dark matter halos. We find that the distribution of SG orientations is strongly anisotropic, with the preferred orientation being that which is closest to the primary galaxy's disk. This is true both for galaxies in spherical halos and for those in more oblate halos. We find that this preferred orientation is consistent with the orientation of the primary galaxy being due to tidal influence. We present a simple model in which this preference is generated by the bar of the primary galaxy imposing a torque on the SG which has a torque in the opposite direction. The preference is stronger for SGs which are closer to the primary galaxy and for SGs which are less massive. This is consistent with the bar of the primary galaxy having the most influence on SGs which are most likely to be tidally disturbed and on SGs which are the easiest to disturb. We discuss the implications of this preferred orientation for the nature of dark matter halos and for the process of galaxy formation."}
{"text":"\nWe study the phenomenology of GUT-less supersymmetry breaking (SSB) in detail. We consider the simplest case of a pureGravity(M) super Yang-Mills theory with a cosmological constant and a single complex scalar field. The SUSY breaking phase is generated by a pair of weak vector bosons with a small mass, which are eaten by the corresponding fermionic partners. We find that this theory contains two types of SUSY breaking: a small amount of \"normal\" SUSY breaking and a large amount of \"cosmological\" SUSY breaking. By using the 2022 atheory, we evaluate the radiative corrections to the SUSY breaking Hamiltonian and show that the small amount of SUSY breaking can be either positive or negative, while the large amount of SUSY breaking is always positive. We also show that the SUSY breaking mass can be either small or large, without any special relation to the TeV scale. The physical SUSY breaking mass can be smaller than the absolute value of the cosmological SUSY breaking mass. Our results suggest that a pure Gravity(M) theory with a cosmological constant and a single complex scalar field can have a wide variety of SUSY breaking phases, and the physical SUSY breaking mass can be either small or large, without any special relation to the TeV scale."}

{"text":"\nThe classification of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) has been largely\nbased on the homology of their amino acid sequences. Because of the\nsequential and evolutionary nature of amino acid changes, however,\ndifferences in the amino acid sequences of GPCRs may not always reflect\nfunctional or pharmacological differences. We have recently proposed a\nmethod for the classification of GPCRs based on their conformational\nfeatures, which we refer to as the 'Conformation Space Method'. In this\npaper, we show that this method is not only 'robust' in that it\nclassifies GPCRs that have already been functionally characterized, but\nthat it can also be used to identify novel classes of GPCRs based on\ntheir conformation space properties. We demonstrate this by identifying\nand characterizing a new class of GPCRs ( referred to as the\n'Family C' GPCRs) whose members have characteristic three-dimensional\nfeatures that are not apparent from their primary amino acid sequence.\nThese 'Family C' GPCRs include the SREB (endothelial differentiation,\nretraction and migration) receptors, which we show to be receptors for\nthe Scarletasterol family of lysophospholipids. We also show that the\nFES (Fibroblast Endothelial sf-1) receptors, which include the\nendothelin A, B and C receptors, and the CENP (centromere-binding\nprotein) receptors, which include the Reelin receptor, both contain the\ncharacteristic 'Family C' conformation space signature. The 'Family C'\nGPCRs are a new class of GPCRs whose three-dimensional structures\ncombine features of both Class A (the secretin-like receptors) and\nClass B (the glutamate receptors). We show that the 'Family C'\nGPCRs are evolutionarily related to the CCK\/gastrin-like receptors,\nwhich are the founding members of Class A, and that they constitute a\nnew subfamily within the Class A GPCRs. Our results also suggest that\nthe 'Family C' GPCRs may have evolved from a common ancestor with\nthe Class B GPCRs."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present here results of a statistical study of the distribution of active galactic nuclei (AGN) in clusters of galaxies. Our analysis is based on the analysis of the galaxies in clusters from the two largest galaxy redshift surveys, the 2 Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS) and the Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS), in combination with a new high-redshift cluster catalog. We find that the probability distribution of the number of AGN per cluster is well described by a power law, with a slope of 1.5 and a mean of 1.9. This is consistent with a model in which the number of AGN per cluster is drawn from a Poisson distribution with a mean rate of 1.9 AGN per cluster. We also find that the mean and standard deviation of the number of AGN per cluster are larger in clusters at higher redshift, consistent with the expectation that clusters are more efficient at creating and hosting galaxies, including active galaxies, at higher redshift. We find that the distribution of AGN in clusters is well described by a single power law, with a cut-off at redshift 2.5, regardless of the cluster redshift. We show this to be consistent with the hypothesis that the distribution of the number of AGN per cluster is the same for all clusters, and that the shape of this distribution has not changed significantly in the last 10 Gyr."}
{"text":"\n\nSpectral methods for orthogonal rational functions.\n\nWe consider spectral methods for approximating orthogonal rational functions by sums of orthonormal basis functions. Such approximations are of interest for applications in computer graphics, where fast and accurate evaluation of derivatives is a major issue. We show that if the basis functions are expanded in a local orthogonal basis, then the resulting approximation has the same orthogonality property as the original rational function. The proposed method is applicable to anisotropic metrics and provides an alternative to the celebrated non-rational basis spline method of orders 1 and 2. In particular, we show that the approximation by the proposed spectral method has the same stability as the approximation by the basis spline method, which is not the case for the well-known quadric spline method. We implement the proposed method using the fast Fourier transform, which allows to compute the approximation with a few multiplications and additions. Finally, we show that the proposed method can be viewed as a generalization of the basis spline method, where the latter is obtained by setting the basis functions to be the monomials."}
{"text":"\n\nElectrostatic Space Tower (Mast, New Space Elevator)\n\nWe consider a new space elevator design that uses a thin mast (pylon) with a positive electrostatic charge to repel a negatively charged platform. This system is a more efficient version of the original space elevator design, which is a much taller structure that uses a rope or cable system. The new design does not require the construction of a tall structure, and therefore, is much more feasible. In addition, the new design allows for much faster transit times since it is not limited by the speed of the rope\/cable system.\n\nThe purpose of this work is to investigate the optimal design of an electrostatic space tower. The key idea is to use a charged mast to repel a charged platform. This allows the platform to be lifted into space without the need for a tall structure. The platform is then used to support a structure in space, such as a space station or a satellite.\n\nWe begin by analyzing the basic principles of the electrostatic space tower. We then consider the optimal design of the mast and the platform. We consider the effects of the size and shape of the mast and the platform, as well as the charge on each. We also consider the optimal placement of the mast and the platform.\n\nAfter analyzing the optimal design of the electrostatic space tower, we consider the practical implications of the design. We consider the materials that could be used to build the mast and the platform, as well as the power source for the electrostatic charges. We also consider the possible applications of the space tower, such as a space station or a satellite.\n\nFinally, we consider the future research directions for the electrostatic space tower. We consider the effects of different materials and shapes on the performance of the space tower, as well as the optimal placement of the mast and the platform.

{"text":"\nWe present helioseismic results from a monitoring campaign of a solar flare-induced sunquake that occurred on 2005 January 15. We have used Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and Heliworks spectrograms from Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) to determine the properties of the sunquake source in the solar photosphere. Our results show that the source is a cellular structure with a dipolar magnetic field configuration. We have used theHelioseismic Inverse Method (HIM) to derive the seismic moment tensor (MMT) and the stress tensor (ST) of the source. The MMT is found to be dominated by the dipole moment of the source magnetic field. The ST is found to be in a state of triangular shear with a non-zero three-way torque component. This is consistent with a ` smoking gun' diagnosis for this sunquake, as the three-way torque component is the only stress component that can be excited by the moment from a pure dipole source. We find that the largest sunquake sources in terms of their moment magnitude (Mw) are associated with magnetic flux concentrations in the solar photosphere. The most dramatic example is the prominence- associated sunquake source, which is a member of the Solar Flare Seismic Network (SFYN), and was responsible for the largest sunquake event in over 25 years, with an Mw of 3.3 in 2002 February. The interpretation of the sunquike sources in terms of their moment tensor and stress tensor properties provides physical insights into the nature of solar structure and its ability to generate sunquakes."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate the effect of multiplicative noise on the transient and asymptotic behavior of a parametric resonant system.

{"text":"\n\nWe present a detailed study of the metallicity distribution in high latitudes during the last 3 Gyr with the SDSS. We find that the distribution of stars with [Fe\/H] > +0.3 in these regions is well described by a power law with an index of 1.5 \u00b1 0.2 and a metallicity gradient of 0.54 \u00b1 0.09 dex kpc-1, if the Local Group metallicity is adopted as the reference. We show this result is consistent with the strong latitudinal segregation of the metallicity distribution in the solar neighborhood. The high-latitude metallicities are generally lower than the solar neighborhood and the core of the Galactic disc. This result implies that the accretion of gas and stars in high latitudes has proceeded in a non-uniform manner, possibly due to the competition between the different physical mechanisms regulating the Galactic dynamics, such as the supernova feedback and the large-scale gravitational instabilities. We have also investigated the correlation between the high-latitude metallicity distribution and the stellar population properties in terms of age and extinction. The correlation between metallicity and age is found to be significant, confirming that the metallicity distribution is regulated by the star formation history in high latitudes. We also find a significant correlation between metallicity and extinction, suggesting that both these quantities are regulated by the same physical mechanism. The comparison of the metallicity distribution in high latitudes with the local metallicity distribution in the solar neighborhood suggests that the large-scale metallicity distribution in the Galactic disc has been regulated by the competition between the processes of gas infall, radiative cooling and supernova feedback, which have resulted in a rather well-defined metallicity gradient in the range of 2\u20134 kpc from the Sun."}
{"text":"\n\nTransient X-ray Emission from Normal Galactic Nuclei\n\nWe present observations of X-ray transient emission from 17 nuclear hydrogen bombs in galaxies in the Local Volume. These galaxies include members of the Local Group and galaxies beyond the Local Group. The X-ray transient emission occurs at the nucleus and is not accompanied by any optical emission counterpart. The transient X-ray sources have luminosities of a few tens of eringites and have remained active for a few hundred thousand years. We find that the transient X-ray emission is likely due to the accretion of gas from the intergalactic medium onto the supermassive black hole. Our results suggest that accretion onto supermassive black holes is more efficient in nearby galaxies than in distant galaxies. The accretion efficiency is likely to decrease with the size of the galactic halo, which contains the intergalactic medium, and thus with the distance to the galaxy. Our results also suggest that accretion from the intergalactic medium may be a possible energy source for supermassive black holes in galaxies that are not accreting from their disks. We discuss our results in the framework of simple models."}

{"text":"\n\nWe present an optimal occulter design strategy for finding extrasolar planets. Our method is based on the use of a thin circular occulter, placed at the optimal distance from the target star to maximize the contrast between the star and the sky background. Our analysis includes the effect of diffraction around the occulter, and we evaluate the optimal diameter for a given distance. We also take into account the required precision in the radial direction, as well as the effect of proper motion of the star, in order to derive the optimal observing strategy. The method is evaluated using a model of the region around the solar system, and applying different criteria in terms of probability of detection and number of planets to be detected. We also derive a simple formula for the optimal occulter area, which depends only on the stellar radius and the distance to the star. Our analysis indicates that a rather large occulter is required to achieve a high probability of detection, and that a distance in the range of 10-100 pc is optimal to find small extrasolar planets around solar-type stars.\n\nWe also present a design for a thin occulter which can be used for the optimal occulter strategy, and which can be built using current technology. The occulter design consists of a thin foil which is deformed by a set of internal pressure gradients, so that the desired shape is obtained without the need of any internal structure. We analyze the required pressure, and the optimal pressure distribution to obtain a good approximation to a thin occulter, and we evaluate the effect of different foil materials. Our analysis shows that a foil with a thickness in the range of 10-100 microns is sufficient to withstand the required pressure. We also analyze the effect of the occulter color on the detection probability, and we derive a simple relation between the color and the optimal occulter area."}
{"text":"\nWe present scaling relations for the intensity distribution of radio halos in cluster galaxies, based on the analysis of a sample of 52 clusters with galaxies in the range 8 < log(Mpc\/h) < 11. We find that the correlation between the radio halo intensity and the cluster mass is described by a power law with a correlation coefficient of 0.71. The power law index is 1.25 +0.19 and is consistent with the index predicted by the re-acceleration model. We also find that the radio halo intensity distribution is well described by a log-normal distribution with a standard deviation of 1.25, implying that the radio halos in clusters have a scale-free intensity distribution. We discuss these results in the context of the re-acceleration model, which predicts that the power law index is 1.0 and that the distribution is scale-free. We also present a comparison between our results and the predictions of the first-order gradient instability model. We find that the scaling relations we observe are consistent with a model in which the radio halo intensity distribution is determined by the superposition of a small number of discrete, localised sources, and that the correlation between the radio halo intensity and the cluster mass can be described by a simple first-order differential equation."}
{"text":"\nWe present here results of a SuprimeCam observation of the 2004 Perseids meteor shower. We obtain a detection rate of 3.6 \u00b1 0.6 meteors per hour over a 4-hour observation period corresponding to the peak of the shower. We determine the meteoroid distribution and find that it is well described by a power law with an index of 3.1 \u00b1 0.3. This result is consistent with a lognormal distribution and indicates that the Perseids are a typical Shower. We search for periodicity in the meteoroid stream and find a candidate period of 2 hours. This period is stable over the course of the night and does not correspond to any known period in the solar system. If this period is real it could indicate that the Perseids meteor stream is not a simple orbit but rather is the sum of two or more orbits with different periods. We also search for patterns in the sky positions of the meteors and find no significant structure. Finally, we find a strong correlation between the meteor shower and increased numbers of high-amplitude transient events on the solar corona. We discuss possible physical explanations for this correlation."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present here a summary of our results on the study of holes within galaxies. We have used a combination of hydrodynamical and chemical evolution models, together with a semi-analytic model based on the idea of an intergalactic egg, to study the formation of holes within galaxies. Our results show that holes can form by different mechanisms, depending on the nature of the accretion process, and on the chemical composition of the accreted material. We have found that holes can be formed by a process of core collapse, if the accreted material is relatively rich in metals. In this case, the hole is formed by a massive collapse of the gas and stars towards the centre, followed by a period of oscillations in the density distribution. The energy released by this process is large enough to blow away the outer parts of the gas, and the hole will eventually form. We have also found that holes can be formed by a process of gas accretion, if the accreted material is relatively poor in metals. In this case, the hole is formed by a gentle accretion of gas and stars, which eventually leads to a uniform density distribution. The energy released by this process is not enough to blow away the outer parts of the gas, and the hole will not form. Our results suggest that the nature of the accretion process is more important for the formation of holes within galaxies, than the chemical composition of the accreted material."}
{"text":"\nWe present a detailed simulation study of the test mass charging due to solar energetic particles (SEPs) in the Anti-Symmetric Tether Regulation of Outer Disks (ASTROD) I mission. We investigate the charging process on a test mass, which is a conducting sphere, in the presence of a time-dependent background plasma, constituted by a semi-infinite uniform plasma and a spatially dependent background plasma. We solve numerically the nonlinear diffusion equation for the test mass potential, which is a sum of adcpl telegraphic impulse response (TIR) and a low frequency (LF) integral equation. We consider two different shapes for the LF kernel: a punctual kernel and a super-Gaussian kernel, in order to take into account the different spatial structure of the background plasmas. We show that a good agreement between the simulation results and the analytical prediction based on the TIR is obtained when theLF kernel has a punctual form, while it is necessary to use a super-Gaussian kernel to get a good agreement in the case of a spatially dependent background plasma. We also show that theLF potential contribution to the test mass potential can be evaluated analytically in the case of a punctual LF kernel, in good agreement with the simulation results. Finally, we analyze the effect of the spacecraft potential and of the electric field to the test mass charging process."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present an analysis of the transient photoconductivity and thermally stimulated luminescence (TSL) of amorphous silicon based on a model of the recombination and thermalization of photo-excited carriers in the amorphous silicon band-gap. Our formalism provides a rigorous thermodynamic framework for the analysis of the transient photoconductivity and TSL, without the assumption of thermal equilibrium, and can be used to study the transient photoconductivity and TSL under various experimental conditions, such as different excitation regimes and measurement procedures. The resulting equations for the transient photoconductivity and TSL can be solved analytically, in a closed form, for a wide range of parameters. The results obtained are in good agreement with both the available experimental data and previous theoretical treatments of the transient photoconductivity and TSL, which used the quasiequilibrium approximation. In particular, our results reproduce the recently reported discrepancy between the transient photoconductivity and steady-state photoconductivity, in the range of intermediate excited-state lifetimes, for the amorphous silicon model systems. Our analysis also reveals a new effect, the dependence of the transient photoconductivity and TSL on the thermalization time, which has not been reported before."}

{"text":"\n\nThe Clusters Ages Experiment (CASE) is an ongoing program of observations of bright stars in globular clusters to determine their ages by comparison to theoretical isochrones. We present here the results of a program to obtain high-precision U-band photometry of cluster stars with an apparent magnitude of 8.5 or brighter. Our sample consists of 17 stars in nine clusters. For each star we have obtained time series of U-band photometry with exposure times of up to 100 ks. From these data we have derived absolute photometric magnitudes and compared these to isochrones for clusters of known age. We find that the isochrones from the Hyades and Praesepe clusters are consistent with the ages derived from other methods, but the isochrones from the clusters NGC 6 Carib, NGC 6 Faces, NGC 4soap, and NGC 11 Nevi are clearly too old, and the isochrone from NGC 6 villains is too young. We have derived ages for our sample stars by applying the stellar isochrone equation to the best-fit isochrones from Hyades and Praesepe.

The data were obtained with theDutch-Italian detector Array of Germany (DIAG), an imaging spectrometer sensitive in the energy range between150 keV and 10 MeV, mounted on the 2.2-m telescope of the European Space Agency's Infrared Space Observatory(ISO). We find that the counts per second per unit area, in the energy range between 200 keVand 3 MeV, is 5.7 \u00b1 2.3 counts in Berk 87, 1.3 \u00b1 1.1 counts in Cyg OB2 and 2.3 \u00b10.8 counts in Westerlund 2. We conclude that thegamma-ray emission in the clusters is due to the radioactive decay of thorium and uranium. We finda proportionality between the measured gamma-ray flux and the cluster's estimated thorium content, which is inagreement with the predictions of the model of 1996, but in agreement with later models. Thedeviation of the measured gamma-ray flux from the predictions of the 1996 model is explained by aself-absorption effect in the clusters, caused by the high-Z gas in the clusters. We found noevidence for a correlation between the cluster's gamma-ray and radio fluxes. The measuredemission is consistent with the assumption that the gamma rays are produced in the same region as themCluster Radio Telemetry (CRT) emission, but at a larger distance from the centre of the cluster."}

{"text":"\n\nWe have prepared single crystals of MgB2 highly substituted with Li and with Li-C (1-20 mol %) by the in situ reaction of Mg with B and Li in a high-frequency induction furnace. We found that the introduction of Li-C phases in MgB2 did not significantly deteriorate the superconducting properties of the MgB2 phases. In fact, the onset temperatures of the superconducting transition under magnetic field were improved to 39 K in the [Li(B2O3)_{x}Li2O_{y}]+ phase and to 38 K in the MgB2-Li phase in comparison to 37 K in pure MgB2. We have also found that the addition of small amounts of Li (0.1-0.5 mol %) to MgB2 slightly suppressed the superconductivity, but the suppression was not significant in comparison to the effect of MgB2 grains boundaries. These results are consistent with the presence of small MgB2-Li grains (<< superconducting critical size) in the MgB2 matrix.\n\nThe most interesting observation in this work is the strong enhancement of the superconducting transition temperature in a non-superconducting [Li(B2O3)_{x}Li2O_{y}]+ phase by the application of a magnetic field. We found that the Tc increased from 39 K to 46 K by the application of a magnetic field of 4 T. The enhancement of Tc by the magnetic field was much stronger than the one observed in MgB2-Li (from 37 K to 38 K).

The observed distribution of $\\gamma$-ray emission is consistent with a uniform intensity distribution within the torus-like accretion structure, except for a bright spot at the inner boundary. The torus is surrounded by a probable emission-free boundary layer, which is itself surrounded by a scattering layer.

{"text":"\n\nWe propose a model for the large-scale structure of the Universe based on correlated random walks.

We find that the standard power law behavior of the correlation function for large-scale structures holds also for the 21-cm intensity. The power law index for the 21-cm data is slightly larger than the index for the structure of galaxies, which indicates that the correlation lengths in the case of the 21-cm intensity are slightly larger.

{"text":"\n\nInflationary Perturbations: the Cosmological Schwinger Effect\n\nWe consider the problem of inflationary perturbations in the early Universe. We show that an inflationary cosmology with a scalar field that is slowly varying on the largest scales can produce a spectrum of perturbations which is both scale dependent and scale invariant. This occurs when the scalar field has a critical density that is small compared to the Planck density. We show that the resulting perturbations can be described by a Schwinger effect. The slow varying part of the spectrum has the same form as the spectrum that is obtained by a Slowly Varying Matter model, in which the density fluctuations are generated by a scalar field that is slowly varying on the largest scales. We show that the slowly varying part of the spectrum can be generated by a slowly varying scalar field, provided that its critical density is small compared to the Planck density. The resulting spectrum is then scale dependent. We show that the fast varying part of the spectrum is generated by a scalar field that is small on the largest scales. We show that this part of the spectrum can be obtained by a Schwinger effect. The resulting spectrum is then scale invariant. We also show that the slow varying part of the spectrum is related to the slowly varying scalar field, while the fast varying part is related to the quickly varying scalar field.

We derive a simple analytical expression for the mean metal abundance in the virialized gas, which can be used to roughly estimate the metal abundance in galactic and intergalactic gas. In the limit of an infinitesimal minihalo, this expression reduces to the traditional expression for the mean metal abundance in a dilute gas. Within this framework, we discuss the effect of minihlaos on the distribution of metals in the IGM and compare our results with observations. We also derive a simple expression for the abundance of metals in the inner few thousand years of a galactic orbit, and compare this with observations as well."}
{"text":"\n\nBlasting of brittle materials with sharp particles is a simple but effective technique to create a highly etched surface with nanometer-sized features. For example, it is used to etch glass, quartz, and silicon. In this work, we investigate the scaling properties of the resulting surface roughness and explore the effect of the particle size and material properties on the final morphology. We find that the size of the particles has a significant effect on the roughness of the etched surface, and that this effect is more prominent for materials with a higher Young's modulus. We also find that the roughness follows a power-law dependence on the particle size, with a different exponent for each material. Finally, we observe that the roughness is not isotropic, but depends on the direction of the etching. We explain our results with a simple model where the particles indent the surface and the resulting surface roughness is determined by the extent of the indentations and the elastic properties of the material. Our results suggest that, by tuning the size of the particles, one can obtain a desired level of surface roughness for a wide range of materials."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a new finite element model for simulating diffusion in the interphase cell nucleus. Our motivation is to provide a better understanding of the role of intranuclear organization in the regulation of gene expression. We consider a simplified model in which the nucleus is described as a periodic structure of chromatin fiber bundles, which are assumed to be idealized as cylinders. We model the diffusion within the cylinders by a Fick-like equation, and account for the anisotropy of the inter-cylinder space by a relationship that ensures the conservation of flux. We investigate the effect of the porosity and the thickness of the fiber bundles on the effective diffusion coefficients, and study the behavior of the model in the limit of small bundle thickness. We find that the model is capable of describing several features of interphase nuclei, including the observed dependence of the effective diffusion coefficient on the volume fraction of the fiber bundles and the presence of a clear-up regime for the mean intensity of the gene expression signal above a characteristic concentration."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present results of a deep X-ray survey of the inner region of the ering feedback-controlled supernova (SN) 1987A with the XMM-Newton Observatory. We find a small but significant excess (6sigma) of X-ray emission from SN 1987A relative to the level expected from a passive SN. The X-ray excess declines with time in a manner consistent with a radiative levitation model in which the temperature of the detached silicon onion is decreasing. We estimate the mass of the silicon onion to be M_( onion) \\sim 1.3 M_Sun. We find that the temperature of the silicon onion, T_( onion), is decreasing with a decay rate, \\dot{T}_{ onion} \\sim -0.6 keV day^{-1}. We show that this decay rate is consistent with a model in which the temperature of the silicon is set by the heat diffusing from the inner surface of the onion, through the silicon, and out to the outer surface. We also show that this decay rate is consistent with a model in which the silicon is thermally isolated from the inner core of the SN and the outer shell by a layer of several 10's of km of cooler material. We discuss a possible physical explanation for the X-ray excess based on a model in which the silicon shell is \"levitating\" above the SN interior on a buoyant, optically thick, radiative \"plasma pillow\" that is supported by the strong radiative force from the hot interior of the SN."}
{"text":"\nWe study the asymptotic behavior of advection-dominated accretion flows with causal viscosity in a bounded domain. We find that the solutions of the governing equations are well-approximated by a one-dimensional (1D) Lorentzian accretion flow with a singular power law profile in the presence of a global inward flow in the bulk, and that this approximation is valid as long as the characteristic length of the flow is small compared to the size of the domain. We also find that the 1D approximation breaks down when the characteristic length of the flow becomes comparable to the size of the domain. In this case, the flow is well-approximated by a two-dimensional (2D) fluids instability with a constant profile, and the linear growth rate of the flow is controlled by the bulk viscosity. We analyze the effect of a boundary condition at the edge of the domain on the solution of the governing equations. We find that an imposed boundary condition can dramatically affect the growth rate of the solution, in a way that depends on the nature of the flow. We also discuss the connection between our work and the thin-film equation, which describes the evolution of a thin film on a substrate."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present here results of a program to search for radio emission from low-mass protostars using Very-Long-Baseline Interferometry (VLBI). We describe the motivation for the search, the methodology used, and the results obtained. We also discuss the implications of our results for future research. The key idea behind our search is that if a protostar is sufficiently flared, it may be possible to detect it using radio interferometry at milliarcsecond resolution, even if it is embedded in a dense molecular cloud. Our methodology consists of searching a large number of molecular clouds in the Milky Way for point sources that are visible in both the dust continuum and the hydrogen line, and that have radio emission at a wavelength of 1.3 cm. We have identified a total of eight sources in our survey that are likely to be low-mass protostars. The sources are distributed in a manner that is consistent with the expectations from a statistical model in which the occurrence of protostars is Poissonian with a mean density of 0.5 protostars per cubic megaparsec. We discuss the implications of our results for future research."}
{"text":"\nWe present a technique to measure the detection efficiency of Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) and use it to investigate the effect of background cosmic-ray events on their performance. Our method is based on the comparison of two measurements: one performed with the IACTs and the other with a standard tracker, both monitoring the same flux of cosmic rays. The comparison allows us to determine the efficiency of the IACTs as a function of the flux of cosmic rays and of the properties (energetic and spectral distribution) of the cosmic-ray events. We show that the IACTs are able to detect a large fraction of the cosmic rays, although their efficiency depends weakly on the energy and the spectral distribution of the cosmic-ray events. The results obtained with our method are consistent with the hypothesis that the cosmic-ray events are not efficiently rejected by the IACTs and that they contribute to the background noise of the telescopes. Our analysis allows a quantitative evaluation of this effect. We find that the noise contribution due to the detection of cosmic-ray events is small compared to the instrumental noise and the thermal noise and that it does not affect the ability of IACTs to measure the atmospheric Cherenkov background. We also show that the noise contribution from the cosmic-ray events is not affected by the length of the exposure, the size of the detector, or the observing strategy (for example, whether the observation is made in \"synchro\" or \"asynchro\" mode). We finally discuss the implications of our results for the analysis of data from IACTs and for the interpretation of the physical processes responsible for the production of cosmic rays and of atmospheric Cherenkov light."}

{"text":"\n\nWe present new observations of the subpulse modulation properties of pulsars at 92 cm and the frequency dependence of subpulse modulation. We use the fast Fourier transform technique to extract the modulation spectrum from the pulse profiles of 13 pulsars observed at a frequency of 92 cm. The observed modulation is decomposed into amplitude and phase modulation, and the resulting power spectra are compared to the power spectra expected for a range of model modulation depths. The best fit to the data is obtained with a model in which the modulation depth is constant and equal to 0.12. This result is consistent with previous observations at 350 MHz and demonstrates that pulsars can support a large amount of modulation at radio frequencies. We also present observations of the frequency dependence of subpulse modulation. These observations show that the modulation depth is proportional to the frequency. This result is consistent with the theory of frequency-dependent modulation and indicates that the electrical activity in the accretion disk is independent of the orbital period of the disk."}

{"text":"\n\nWe present sub-arcsecond CO(1-0) and CO(2-1) observations of the ultraluminous infrared galaxy IRAS 10190+1322. These data are the most sensitive and spatially-resolved measure of the gas distribution in the galaxy. The data show a clumpy distribution of gas with a total mass of 1.4 kpc^2. The data can be described by a model in which the gas is evenly distributed within the galaxy but has clumped into four distinct regions, two of which are associated with the strong radio sources at the ends of the galaxy and the other two of which are associated with fainter radio sources in the central region of the galaxy. We discuss several models to explain the origin of the gas clumps. We find that a model in which the clumps are collimated along magnetic field lines is as effective at fitting the data as a model in which the gas is distributed isotropically and the clumps are the result of radiative cooling, and that a model in which the gas is distributed along the longest dimension of the galaxy and the clumps are formed by gravitational instability is also consistent with the data. We discuss the implications of our findings for models of ultraluminous infrared galaxy formation and for the kinematics of gas in the galaxies."}

We find the disk to be comprised of dust at a range of heliocentric distances, including a belt at ~1.5 AU, which could be the source of the disk's halo. We present high-resolution spectroscopy and photometry of the star that is consistent with a kinematic age of 2.6 Gyr. The disk does not exhibit any evidence of an embedded planet, despite having a dynamical lifetime of >3 Gyr. We search for transits by the known giant planets, and find that only a transiting planet with a radius >4.5 RJ would be detectable at the 5-sigma level. We discuss these results in the context of the giant planet's origins, and suggest that the system was either born with a large number of giant planets that have since been dynamically ejected, or that the giant planets formed later. We present an upper limit on the number of giant planets in the system of 0.5."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a statistical analysis of the core lifetime in turbulent, magnetically supercritical molecular clouds. We consider the effect of the magnetic field on the turbulence, which is known to enhance the turbulence by the mean field approximation. We employ the gyrokinetic turbulence model, which describes the turbulence as a combination of waves and vortices, to calculate the turbulence energy spectrum and the lifetime of turbulence, which is the inverse of the energy spectrum. We also employ the magnetohyrodynamic (MHD) model to calculate the evolution of the magnetic field, which is the energy source of the turbulence. We find that the lifetime of turbulence is significantly longer in the presence of a magnetic field. We also find that the lifetime of turbulence is inversely proportional to the turbulence energy spectrum. This implies that the turbulence energy is efficiently distributed to the large scales, which is the opposite to the energy spectrum of the turbulence without the magnetic field. We discuss the implications of our results for the dynamics of turbulence and the transport of angular momentum in magnetically supercritical molecular clouds."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present observations of the oxygen distribution in the photosphere of a red giant and in a satellite galaxy, which have been made with the Hubble Space Telescope. The observations reveal oxygen lines in regions of the photosphere that are relatively free of other chromospheric activity, and have a very high contrast compared to other structures in the atmosphere. The line-forming regions appear as small, isolated clouds, and are located at different altitudes in the atmosphere. We estimate the mass of the clouds to be in the range of 10^3-10^5 M_{\\odot}. The clouds have a temperature of about 6000 K, and are probably composed of dust particles. The observations show that massive cloud regions can exist in evolved stars, and suggest that massive gas ejections can occur in stars which have a complex network of regions at different temperatures and densities. The presence of massive cloud regions in the outer atmosphere of an evolved star may be important in determining the mass loss rate, and possibly the evolutionary path, of these stars."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider the spectral fluctuations of random tridiagonal matrices from the beta-Hermite ensemble. We show that such matrices have pure point spectra and that their spectral fluctuations are independent of the details of the underlying Hermite ensemble. As a consequence, the variance of the spectrum of these matrices is the same as the variance of the spectrum of the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble. In particular, if the Hermite ensemble is obtained by putting the same random variables in the diagonal and in the off-diagonal of the matrix, the variance of the spectrum is equal to the variance of the spectrum of the inverse of the matrix. We show that this variance grows like the square of the dimensionality of the underlying space. This implies that the variance grows very fastly as the dimension increases, and that the smallest eigenvalue of such matrices has a variance which is proportional to the square of the dimension. As a by-product of our analysis we show that the inverse of a Hermite matrix has the same distribution as the original matrix."}
{"text":"\nWe present a detailed study of the evolution of interstellar clouds in a streaming hot plasma including heat conduction. Our aim is to investigate the effects of the heat flow on the density structure of the cloud and the subsequent effects on the evolution of the cloud. We solve the hydrodynamic equations for a cloud with a given density structure which is interacting with a streaming hot plasma. The streaming motion is described by a single-phase model with a temperature-dependent viscosity. Convection is included in the model in the form of a passive scalar field. The effect of the heat conduction is incorporated by solving the energy equation in a thermally homogeneous cloud. The evolution of the cloud is investigated for different initial conditions and parameter values. We show that the heat flow can have a significant effect on the cloud evolution. The most remarkable effects are the increase of the local cloud density and the development of density structures which are most likely to be observed inreality."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a study of a strongly lensed Lyman Break Galaxy (LBG) in the ACS Spectroscopic Galaxy Survey towards Abell 1689. We have constructed a model of the light-profile of the galaxy in the form of a sextet of arcs, which allows us to determine the optical parameters of the galaxy. We find that the galaxy is a very luminous LBG, with an absolute magnitude of -15.3 and a visual extinction of 1.4, both of which are among the highest values reported for a LBG. The high extinction is explained by a combination of the lensing and the high metallicity of the foreground galaxy cluster. We find that the contribution of the arc with the highest surface-brightness is the most reliable, and we use this arc to derive the stellar mass and the metallicty of the LBG. We find that the stellar mass of the LBG is 2.4 $\\times 10^{11}$ $M_{\\odot}$, which implies that the LBG is a member of the rare class of gas-rich galaxies. The metallicity of the LBG is $Z=1.2$, which is intermediate between the metallicities of galaxies in rich clusters and field galaxies. We find that the observed distribution of stellar mass and metallicty in the local volume is consistent with the MOND-type model for galaxy formation, in which field galaxies are formed by accretion of gas and galaxies in clusters are formed by gravitational instability."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present new non-linear analyses of the period-luminosity relation for the Large Magellanic Cloud Cepheid variables, based on the Testimator and Schwarz Information Criterion methods. The Testimator analysis gives a significantly improved period-luminosity relation, with a best-fit relation of period versus luminosity that is both linear and stable. This relation can be used to accurately derive the absolute magnitude and, through a comparison with the distances derived from the recent Hubble Space Telescope observations of the LMC Cepheids, the distance to this galaxy. The Testimator analysis shows that the scatter in the period-luminosity relation is mainly due to a few outliers. The SIC method, on the other hand, provides a clear signature of non-linearity in the period-luminosity relation. We find that a power law relation is consistent with the data, if the non-linear terms are not included. If the non-linear terms are included, a linear relation is obtained, in agreement with the result from the Testimator analysis. The best-fit relation in both cases (with and without non-linear terms included) is significantly different from a single power law relation. We discuss the implications of these results for the determination of the distance to the LMC, and for the understanding of the evolution of Cepheid variables."}

{"text":"\n\nWe present a statistical study of the optical morphologies and radii of star clusters in M51, based on the analysis of three deep images obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope's Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS). Our main results can be summarized as follows. (1) We find that the clusters in M51 exhibit a wide range of radii, but they can be subdivided into two groups, based on their radius distribution functions (RDFs). The first group, which comprises the majority (68%) of clusters, has a power law RDF with a cutoff at the cluster's virial radius. The second group, which contains only 32% of the clusters, has a more compact, exponential RDF. (2) The power law RDF is in good agreement with the theoretical predictions of King and 1993, while the exponential RDF is in conflict with these predictions. (3) The optical morphology of each cluster is determined by the underlying physical properties of the cluster, such as its mass, radius, and age. (4) We show that the cluster's radius can be estimated with a high degree of confidence from its optical morphology, and that this estimate is in good agreement with the cluster's virial radius. (5) We present a model in which the different radius distribution functions are explained as the result of different \"birth times,\" which in turn are related to the process of star formation and to the dynamics of the clusters.\n\nWe conclude that the main result of our study is the evidence for two different populations of star clusters in M51, with different properties and different origin, and we discuss the physical mechanisms that may produce these different properties.

{"text":"\n\nWe present a study of the UV star formation rate (SFR) in the local universe, based on a catalogue of over 800 galaxies in the local supercluster with available UV data from GALEX.

We estimate the local star formation history to be well described by a power law decay since the main epoch of star formation in the local volume, approximately 10 billion years ago. Our high-order noise removal algorithm for GALEX data shows that the locally adopted criteria for removing the brightenings due to dust is unnecessary, and that a simple algorithm is sufficient. We also present a new method for separating star clusters from galaxies in optical images, based on the UV-optical colour distribution, and apply this to the Local Volume galaxies.

{"text":"\nWe present a detailed statistical analysis of the relation between the velocity dispersion and optical richness (or age) of the galaxy clusters belonging to the SDSS BCG catalogue, a sample of which contains many of the most massive and luminous galaxy clusters in the local volume.

The power law index and the cutoff scale are found to be in good agreement with the theoretical predictions of an arrested $\\Gamma$-class cluster model. Our result implies that the velocity dispersion of a cluster is largely controlled by its optical richness. We show that this conclusion can be understood in the framework of a simple model in which the mean cluster velocity is proportional to the square root of the optical richness.

{"text":"\n\nWe investigate the entanglement and topological entropy of the toric code on a Euclidean lattice at finite temperature. We find that the entanglement grows like the logarithm of the temperature, with a prefactor that depends on the local number of sites.

On the other hand, the topological entropy grows like the square of the temperature, with a prefactor that again depends on the local number of sites. We show that both the entanglement and topological entropy have a precise rigorous definition in terms of the category of mechanisms, which are symmetry-protected operations on the code that commute with the thermal baths. Our results suggest that in the thermodynamic limit the toric code is in a subtle sense \"more disordered\" than the Gaussian code, even though it is a completely symmetrical code.\n\nWe would like to thank M.

{"text":"\n\nWe present a catalog of 75 Seyfert galaxies observed with the HST ACS in the near-UV, for which we have determined the positions of the nuclear regions with an accuracy of better than 2 arcsec.

In addition, the morphologies of the nuclear regions in the UV are much more diverse, including ringed, cored, and eccentric morphologies, not observed in the infrared. We find that the observed diversity in nuclear morphology cannot be described with a single parametric model such as a Spitzer-H sword, but requires a more complex model with at least 3 parameters. We present such a model and use it to analyze the nuclear morphology of our sample.

{"text":"\n\nAbstract for: Astrophysical Accretion as an Analogue Gravity Phenomena\n\nWe investigate the analogy between the dynamical processes that occur in astrophysical accretion discs and the gravitational dynamics of compact objects in general relativity. We show that such an analogy can be established by considering the relativistic dynamics of an accretion disc with a corrected empirical equation of state. We derive a new equation for the accretion rate, which in the limit of large gravitational radius is shown to be analogous to the Poisson equation for the gravitational field. As an application, we investigate the effects of the change of the equation of state on the stability of a ring-like structure that surrounds the disc and is held in place by its own gravitational attraction. We show that such a structure can be stable against the disruption by the disc's gravitational field, provided that the ratio of the structure's mass to the disc's mass is sufficiently large. We also show that the structure's gravitational field can be used to extract energy from the disc, provided that the structure's mass is sufficiently large. We comment on the analogy between the processes that occur in the disc and in the structure, and draw a parallel between the energy extraction process and the gravitational radiation emission process in general relativity."}
{"text":"\n\nConnectivity measures how strongly nodes in a network interact with each other. In cortical networks, nodes are neurons and their connections are synapses. We can measure the strength of these synapses from spike-triggered averaging of calcium signals in voltage-sensitive dyes. We recently developed a way to measure the strength of synaptic connectivity between pairs of neurons using a random-section technique that does not require any assumptions about the underlying network model. We found that the distribution of synaptic connectivity follows a power law, with a positive correlation between the exponent and the brain's entropy. This measure of synaptic connectivity can be used to probe the underlying topological structure of cortical networks. We found that the correlation between synaptic connectivity and the network's spectral properties holds across different cortical areas and species, and is more consistent than other measures of network connectivity, such as the mean-level connectivity or the small-worldness. We also found that the synaptic connectivity between pairs of neurons can be used to predict the long-range connections that define the underlying topological structure of cortical networks. Our results suggest that the distribution of synaptic connectivity contains topological information about the underlying network, and can be used to predict the connections between different cortical areas."}
{"text":"\nWe present a theory of the intrinsic generation of spin echoes in dipolar solids by strong pi pulses. The theory is based on a rigorous, fully consistent, and exact treatment of the evolution of the spin and the spin-current density in the presence of a strong pulse, in terms of the spin-current density-functional and the commutator of the spin-current density-functional with the spin-current density. We show that the intrinsic spin echoes can be explained by a simple and general mechanism, which does not require the involvement of any transient spin-current density-fluctuations, and that the theory can be exactly solved for a large class of dipolar solids. The exact solutions show that the intrinsic echo is always a broad spectrum, and that the position of the echo maximum depends on the anisotropy of the solid. The good agreement between the theory and the experiments suggests that the intrinsic spin echoes may be useful for characterizing the structural and dynamical properties of the solids."}
{"text":"\nWe study disordered materials whose microstructure can be altered by thermo-mechanical treatments. Our focus is on the mechanism of the transition from one disordered state to another, and the relation between the structure, the thermo-mechanical treatments, and the functional properties of the material. We consider both elastic and plastic mechanisms of changes in the microstructure. We find that in some cases the disordered state with higher strength can be obtained by a thermo-mechanical treatment, while in some cases this treatment leads to a weakening of the material. The ability to tune the thermo-mechanical treatments in order to obtain a desirable disordered state, and the stability of this state against a thermal treatment or an additional mechanical treatment, are also discussed. We show that the disordered state with higher strength is not necessarily the most stable state. We also study the peak effect, which is a strengthening mechanism in disordered materials due to the creation of stress concentrations in the microstructure. We discuss the conditions under which this effect is active, and the relation between the peak effect and the mechanical behavior of disordered materials. We also study the effect of polydispersity on the thermo-mechanical treatments and on the final microstructure and strength of the material. We show that polydispersity can have a positive or a negative effect on the strength of the material, depending on the composition of the microstructure. We also discuss the possibility of using a polydisperse powder mixture in order to obtain a desirable microstructure with improved strength."}
{"text":"\nWe study the Casimir effect in a 6D warped flux compactification model. In our model, the standard 4D spacetime is compactified by a 3D warped surface. The aim of this work is to investigate the Casimir effect in a 6D warped space-time which includes both a 4D flat bulk and a 2D curved surface. The surface gravity can be treated as a vectorial correction to the bulk gravity. In our model, the bulk gravity is always the dominant contribution to the total gravity field. The surface Casimir effect is induced by the difference between the bulk and the surface gravity. We find the surface Casimir stress has a non-monotonic distribution with the bulk height. Our model has two special bulk heights at which the surface Casimir stress reaches its minimum and maximum values. We also find that the bulk Casimir stress has a non-monotonic distribution with the bulk height. The sign of the bulk Casimir stress is opposite to that of the surface Casimir stress. The bulk Casimir stress is related to the bulk entropy. We also obtain the bulk and surface stress-energy kernels. Our model can be used to test the positivity of the stress-energy kernel."}
{"text":"\nWe consider the problem of energy dissipation in a mesoscopic superconductor, in the presence of a dissipative, anisotropic electric field at its surface. We show that, in contrast to the case of a bulk superconductor, such a field does not destroy superconductivity, but instead gives rise to a new type of dissipation, which we call ac dissipation. We determine the frequency-dependent conductivity of the superconductor in the presence of the field, and show that it exhibits a distinct peak at a frequency that depends on the anisotropy of the field and the underlying mechanism of dissipation. We analyze the physical origin of this peak, and show that it is related to the breaking of time-reversal symmetry in the superconducting order parameter. Our results suggest that the concept of ac dissipation can be useful in understanding the effects of various types of anisotropic fields on mesoscopic superconductors, and may have practical implications for the design of nanostructured superconducting materials."}
{"text":"\nWe present a theory of the formation of protogalaxies from the statistical equilibrium of point masses. We show that this theory can naturally explain the virialization of matter, the conversion of the bulk kinetic energy of particles into the rotational energy of the protogalaxy. Our theory provides a solution to the problem of angular momentum loss, resulting in the halt of the expansion of the Universe and the subsequent contraction of matter into clusters of galaxies. We show that this process is regulated by the conservation of total mechanical energy, $\\dot{U}=\\dot{K}+\\dot{V}$, where $\\dot{K}$ is the rate of change of kinetic energy, and $\\dot{V}$ is the rate of change of potential energy. We predict that the dynamic evolution of a protogalaxy is characterized by the development of a single massive object, the protobaryon, around which the other matter is accreted. We show that this is a generic feature of the dynamics of dark matter, and can be used to infer the properties of the underlying theory. We discuss the implications of our theory for the origin of structure in the Universe, and for the theory of galaxy formation."}
{"text":"\nWe consider the gravitational collapse of spherically symmetric plasmas in Einstein-Maxwell spacetimes. We obtain exact solutions for a generic class of spherically symmetric plasmas which includes perfect fluids, and find that these solutions are stable against a gradual transformation of the plasma to a black hole. We also find that the solutions are stable against a sudden (adiabatic) compression of the plasma. However, this stability is achieved by a slow-down of the collapse in a finite range of radii. Therefore, a finite region of the plasma has a volume expansion which is balanced by a surface tension. We show that this region of slow-down can be made arbitrarily small by a proper choice of the fluid parameters, and thus the region of slow-down has a typical size of order 1 Planck length. Therefore, for generic spherically symmetric plasmas the Einstein-Maxwell theory leads to black holes with a surface tension. We discuss possible physical realizations of this surface tension, and show that the surface tension can be related to the tension in a solid shell which is surrounding the black hole."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present observations of quiet Sun regions of the photosphere in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and compare the observations with three-dimensional (3D) numerical simulations of the solar photosphere. We find that the observed EUV contrast is generally higher than the contrast obtained in the simulations, even in the quiet Sun regions, suggesting that some physical processes in the photosphere are not yet properly represented in the 3D numerical simulations. We identify the main source of the discrepancy to be due to the fact that the radiative transfer used in the simulations is too simple and does not account for the effects of non-magnetic photospheric absorbing elements, such as the molecules and the relatively small dust particles, on the formation of the EUV spectral features. We also show that the radiative transfer in the 3D numerical simulations is sensitive to the numerical resolution, especially for quiet Sun regions, and discuss the implications of this finding for the future work on improving the radiative transfer in the numerical simulations."}
{"text":"\nWe study two-loop world-sheet corrections in the AdS_5 x S^5 superstring on a D3-brane. We consider a general N=1 gauge group and find the necessary world-sheet integrals. The use of the stringy constrained fermion coupling constant allows a compact and transparent formulation. The only integration parameter is the superpotential index and we evaluate the world-sheet corrections for the simplest case of a pure gauge theory. We find a series of higher-loop terms which become relevant when the dimension of the compactification is larger than the radius of the D3-brane. In the pure gauge theory the world-sheet correction can be thought of as the leading contribution from the ghost fermion mechanism plus a residual two-loop contribution which is an A-string like object. We discuss the structure of the world-sheet in the presence of a cosmological constant and show that the ghost fermion mechanism is not able to produce a pure gravity theory. The inclusion of the two-loop terms is able to produce a pure gravity theory. We compare our results with the world-sheet description for the A_n-branes and find a very good agreement."}

{"text":"\nWe study complex dynamical systems in which switches can be turned on and off, leading to structural reconfigurations. We focus on two exemplary systems: a cell-cycle model with a complex network of activators and inhibitors, and a toy model of opinion dynamics on a social network. In both systems, the network structure is obtained by means of a clustering algorithm that considers the dynamics of the system. We find that the resulting networks are small-world, and that their structure can be understood in terms of local rules that depend only on the number of connections to a given node. We show that such structural reconfigurations can be achieved by using only a small number of switches that are connected to high degree nodes. We further show that such a switching scheme can be found using an algorithm that is conceptually related to the cluster algorithm. Our results suggest that large-scale reconfigurations of complex dynamical systems can be achieved by means of a relatively small number of switches that are connected to high degree nodes."}
{"text":"\n\nWe investigate cooperation among two transmitters and two receivers in a wireless relay network. We assume that the two transmitters have independent information to send to the two receivers, and that they share a common (wireless) relay channel to communicate. We find that the relays can substantially increase the capacity of the network, in the sense that the rates achievable by the transmitters increase substantially if the relays are allowed to cooperate in the transmission process. We show that this result can be guaranteed by using a generalized family of schedules, which we call semi- schedules, to describe the cooperation protocol. We analyze the performance of the protocol under various assumptions about the models for the wireless channels and the information available at the relays. In particular, we show that in a network where the receivers are assumed to have perfect information about the wireless channels and where the transmitters have correlated information, the capacity gain provided by the relays can be very large. We also consider the effect of allowing the relays to make errors in their transmission process, and show that even in this case, the relays can still increase the capacity of the network."}
{"text":"\n\nAbstract for Evaluating Personal Archiving Strategies for Internet-based Information\n\nWe propose a framework for evaluating personal strategies for archiving information from the Web. The framework is fundamentally motivated by the observation that people differ in how they interact with the Web and that this interaction depends on their personal characteristics as well as the specific use context. Our approach is twofold. On the one hand, we present a comprehensive model of personal archiving strategies, which is based on a thorough review of the literature on information archiving and our own empirical investigations. On the other hand, we develop a methodology for evaluating personal strategies which takes into account the specific use context as well as the personal characteristics of the users. The evaluation is twofold. In a first step, we identify the extent to which personal strategies are effective in terms of achieving the desired level of information quality. In a second step, we examine the extent to which the strategies are efficient in terms of time and effort spent on finding, evaluating, and storing information. \n\nOur findings suggest that the personal characteristics of the users have a strong influence on their strategies and that different use contexts may require different strategies. We show that a wide range of personal strategies can be effective and efficient at the same time. However, the strategies that are effective and efficient for one use context may not be so for another use context. We discuss the implications of our work for theories of information processing and personal information management, as well as for the design of information systems that support personal information management."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider the problem of generating probability and quantile curves for a random variable with a discontinuous cumulative distribution, under the assumption that the underlying probability density function is constant on each interval on which the cumulative distribution is constant. The standard approach to the problem, which consists in drawing the quantile curves by accumulation of area under the probability curves, may not be applicable in this case, as the probability curves may not cross each other. We propose a method for generating the quantile and probability curves without requiring that they cross each other. The method consists in finding the minimum and maximum of the conditional expectation of the random variable, conditioned to the event that the random variable has a value larger than a given threshold. The conditional expectation can be computed analytically, and the problem then reduces to finding the minimum and maximum of two functions of one variable. We illustrate our method by generating the quantile and probability curves for the random variable with a geometric distribution, whose cumulative distribution is piecewise constant."}
{"text":"\n\nThe Long Term Fate of Our Digital Belongings: Toward a Service Model for Personal Archives\n\nThe explosive growth of personal digital archives, in the form of emails, documents, photographs, videos, and music, creates an unprecedented challenge for the individuals who must preserve these files over the long term. We are failing to preserve our digital belongings, with profound consequences for both the present and the future. The primary cause of this failure is that individuals lack the necessary skills and resources to preserve their digital archives. We describe a system that empowers individuals to preserve their digital belongings. This system is based on an infrastructure of network services that individuals can invoke directly, or via user-level tools that automate the process of archive preservation. Our approach is grounded in a service-oriented architecture, in which the services are stitched together to form a flexible and powerful system. We discuss the implementation of a prototype of this system, and describe our ongoing work to evaluate the system and improve its functionality."}

{"text":"\nWe investigate the problem of endowing graphene with a non-trivial band structure by means of a SU(4) bosonization. In particular we show that a peculiar kind of quasi-particle, called a fermitron, can arise in this setting. This new kind of particle is characterized by a non-trivial internal structure, giving rise to a large number of distinct eigenvalues for the kinetic energy. We show that this fact has important consequences for the nature of the non-trivial band structure that may be obtained in this way. In particular we show that the resulting band structure may be described in terms of a set of inter-related Higgs bundles, which are protected by a set of non-trivial symmetries, and which may be related to the so-called Higgs ghosts. We show that this structure may be understood as a kind of quantum Hall effect, in which the \"cyclotron\" is replaced by a \"fermitron\". We also show that a large class of gauge symmetries may be realized in this setting, in a way which is consistent with the theory of Higgs bundles. This suggests that the structure we obtain is a generalization of the ordinary quantum Hall effect to a large class of systems which include graphene."}

{"text":"\n\nFirst proper motions of thin dust filaments at the Galactic Center\nThe structure and dynamics of the Galactic Center are important clues to understanding the evolution of our Galaxy.

The tdfs have ages on the order of 10 Myr and their proper motions are between 2 and 8 km\/s. We find that the younger tdfs (ages $< 1.5$ Gyr) have proper motions that are systematically higher than the older tdfs, with a mean excess of $\\sim 3$ km\/s. We also find that the proper motion distribution of the tdfs is different from that of the Galactic stars, with a higher fraction of tdfs having proper motions in the range $-1$ to $+1$ km\/s. This may indicate that the tdfs have a different origin than the Galactic disk, and it may imply a Galactic breakup event in the past. We discuss our results in the context of models for the formation and evolution of the Galactic Center."}
{"text":"\nWe study the emission of virtual photons from a relativistic quark-gluon plasma (QGP) and investigate the energy distribution and the production rate of these photons. We calculate the QGP photon energy distribution in the case of a perturbative QGP and find that it is wider than the one observed in heavy ion collisions. The difference is due to the larger energy spread of the virtual photon distribution in the perturbative case. The probability distribution function of the virtual photon emission process is also calculated, and a clear signature of a boost in the probability distribution is found close to the unity contribution from the virtual photon pair production. The high temperature of the QGP and the large density make the QGP photon production rate larger than the one from a hot gas by several orders of magnitude. We also study the coherent radiation of the QGP virtual photons and find that it is possible to produce a coherent radiation with the wavelength of the order of the QGP size."}
{"text":"\n\nHD97048: a closer look to the disk\n\nWe present photometric and spectroscopic observations of the disk around the star HD97048. Our data confirm the presence of dust in the disk and give a better determination of its inner and outer boundaries. The disk extends between 14 and 36 au with a midplane density of 2.2 log( rho\/cm3)12. The inner edge is defined by a sharp increase in the gas line-of-sight (LOS) absorption, and the outer edge is set by the strong dust scattering and the termination of the gas absorption. The gas LOS absorption can be described with a broken power law with a strong absorption feature in the inner part of the disk, possibly due to the influence of the star's inner disk. We estimate the mass of the disk to be 1.5 x 10^35 kg, containing 0.15 Earth masses of heavy elements. The disk has a very low gas fraction, with a ratio of gas to dust mass of only 1:10. This very low gas fraction is surprising and has important consequences for disk evolution. We discuss several possible formation scenarios for such a disk. We also point out that the low gas fraction makes this disk a very inefficient sink for the accretion of matter, and therefore it is likely to be a very old disk."}
{"text":"\nIGR J16194-2810: a new symbiotic X-ray binary\nWe present phase-resolved spectroscopy and photometry of the symbiotic X-ray binary IGR J16194-2810 and classify it as a member of the new class of objects consisting of low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) with non-degenerate companions. We find that the optical and NIR photometry displays a highly unusual light curve with many rapid amplitude fluctuations and a distinctive sawtooth pattern in the optical light curve. We show that these features can be explained by the combination of a smoothly increasing luminosity from the X-ray binary and a bright but variable optical counterpart. We determine the orbital elements of the system and find that the binary is very well-studied in the X-ray band but, despite several previous optical observations, this is the first precise measurement of the orbital elements in the optical band. The companion to the LMXB is a main sequence star of type M. We find that the system has many similarities to the well-known and intensely studied system 1A1171-1963 but is also significantly different in several aspects. In particular, the orbit is much longer, the mass of the companion is lower and the system is likely to be younger. The high-resolution spectroscopy shows that the optical counterpart is a very blue object with a peculiar absorption feature at $\\lambda \\sim 1500 \\mu \\mathrm{nm}$, which we attribute to a layer of warm molecular gas. We discuss the properties of the system and its evolutionary status."}
{"text":"\nWe continue our study of the flow instabilities of magnetic flux tubes in a simple model of a flux tube in a uniform flow. In Part I we considered the steady state of a vertical flux tube in a longitudinal flow and showed that it is unstable against a flow-induced perturbation in a direction perpendicular to the flux tube and the flow. Here we consider the limit of a large vertical tube and a small longitudinal flow. We show that this limit is stable against a flow-induced perturbation in a direction perpendicular to the flux tube and the flow. We then consider the limit of a small vertical tube and a large longitudinal flow. We show that this limit is also stable against a flow-induced perturbation in a direction perpendicular to the flux tube and the flow. In both cases the tube deforms in the longitudinal direction but returns to its original shape after the perturbation has died out. We also show that these limits are stable against a vertical perturbation which does not change the total magnetic flux through the tube."}
{"text":"\nWe quantify the effects of discreteness in N-body simulations of the formation of dark matter haloes in a universe that evolves up to the formation of the first galaxy cluster. We consider a standard toy model of the evolution of the universe, with a parameter that allows us to tune the effects of discreteness. We vary this parameter to study the transition from a discrete to a continuous description of the evolution of the universe. We find that, in the limit of a small parameter, the discrete evolution is equivalent to the continuous one, apart from a contribution that we attribute to the particle horizon. We quantify this contribution and find that it is small for the volumes considered in the toy model. Therefore, we conclude that the discrete evolution of the matter distribution is not affected by the particle horizon, provided that the volume is large enough. We also show that the formation of structure is only slightly affected by the discreteness of the evolution, except for the first generations of haloes, where the effects can be significant."}

We also analyze the effects of the choice of the underlying graph on the statistical mechanics of the network evolution. In this context, we study the approaches to obtain the configurations that minimize or maximize the correlation functions. We derive the conditions that guarantee that these special configurations are stable against changes in the network. As a consequence of these results, we obtain a general algorithm to find the critical points of the correlation functions. We finally study the statistical mechanics of scale-free networks and the related problem of the statistical mechanics of community detection."}

We show that the proposed method is computationally competitive with existing methods while maintaining a high level of statistical accuracy. We illustrate the performance of our method on simulated data and also apply it to a real astronomical data set. In particular, we use multimodal nested sampling to analyze the large-scale structure of the early Universe from the galaxy redshift distribution in the Millennium Galaxy Survey. We show that our method is able to recover the correct model parameters as well as higher-level quantities such as the power spectrum of the initial perturbations with only a small number of model evaluations."}
{"text":"\n\nNetwork statistics on early English Syntax: Structural criteria\n\nWe apply network statistics to a corpus of Old English to investigate its syntax in terms of structural criteria. The investigation comprises four steps. First, we compile a distributional analysis of the most frequent items and ranks them by their degree of association. Second, we apply network statistics to the ranked set of items in order to identify the most central items. Third, we compare the most central items in the network with the items ranked as the most frequent in the distributional analysis, in order to isolate items that are central in the network but not frequent in the distributional analysis. These items are marked as exceptional. Fourth, we compile a list of the most frequent items in the network that are not ranked as the most frequent in the distributional analysis. These items are marked as frequent. In addition, we identify the items that are most central in the network and also frequent, and mark these as especially frequent. We then compare the distribution of exceptional, frequent, and especially frequent items in the network with the distribution of items in the same categories based on their occurrence in a manually annotated reference corpus. The comparison shows that the distribution of items in the network is consistent with the manually annotated reference corpus in terms of both the number of items in each category and their relative frequency. There are, however, two notable differences. First, the network has many more especially frequent items than the reference corpus. Second, the network has many fewer frequent items than the reference corpus. We discuss possible reasons for these differences and conclude that they are most likely due to the particular properties of the network. Our results therefore provide evidence that network statistics can be used to investigate structural criteria in syntax."}

{"text":"\nGamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are the most energetic events in the universe, thought to occur when a supermassive black hole is launched from a dying star. The nature of the launches is not well understood, but the sprays of charged particles which are launched along with the black hole can interact with the surrounding medium, producing a diffuse glow known as an afterglow. We present here results of a systematic, multiwavelength study of the distribution of the afterglow in the circumburst medium of 25 nearby (D\/L < 2000) gamma-ray bursts. We find that the average distribution is well described by a spherical volume distribution with the burst source at the center. We determine the scale-length (r0) of the distribution to be 1.6 \u00b1 0.8 kpc, and the metallicity of the circumburst medium to be Z \u2248 1.5 \u00b1 1.3 Z\u2299. We determine the density structure of the circumburst medium by modeling the time-integrated optical\/NIR afterglow as a function of radius. We find that the density has a substantial radial gradient, with an outer scale-length (r1) of 4.6 \u00b1 1.1 kpc. The mean density in the circumburst medium is \u03c10 \u2248 3.6 \u00b1 2.4 kg m\u22123, with an inner fraction (r < r0) of \u03c11 \u2248 6.7 \u00b1 2.7 kg m\u22123.

{"text":"\n\nWe study two different approaches to nonlinear estimation for Gaussian noise data. The first approach is based on the use of the Dyson indices, and the second approach is based on the use of Hilbert-Schmidt separability functions and the theory of probability. The motivation for the research is that the use of indices and functions in this way allows us to estimate the parameters of the nonlinear system with the minimum amount of computation. In addition, these approaches are naturally suited to be implemented on a computer. The key idea in the research is the use of the properties of the different types of indices and functions. The methodology used is to consider different possible ways of using the indices and functions, and to evaluate the performance of each method by using simulation. The results obtained are that both approaches can be used to estimate the parameters of the nonlinear system with a small amount of computation, and that the use of the indices is more suitable for systems with a small number of parameters, while the use of the functions is more suitable for systems with a large number of parameters. The problem that the work attempts to solve is to find a way to estimate the parameters of a nonlinear system with a small amount of computation, and the work provides a solution to this problem. The practical application of the work is that it provides a way to estimate the parameters of a nonlinear system with a small amount of computation.

{"text":"\n\nWe have developed a computational model of synaptic plasticity that is capable of producing the time course of L-LTP observed in our experiments. The model consists of a conductance-based synapse with a postsynaptic NMDA and a presynaptic inhibition. The parameters of the synaptic model were adjusted to produce a slow synaptic potentiation like the one observed in our experiments. We found that the synaptic mechanism was able to produce three different regimes of synaptic potentiation depending on the relative strengths of the NMDA and the presynaptic inhibition. We will discuss the mechanism of L-LTP under these three different regimes. The model of synaptic plasticity was then used to explore the role of synaptic depression in the maintenance of L-LTP. We found that synaptic depression is necessary for the long-term maintenance of L-LTP but it is not sufficient. We show that synaptic depression can be counteracted by a correlated input to the presynaptic neuron. We also found that a sufficiently strong stimulation of the postsynaptic neuron can produce L-LTP in the absence of synaptic depression. We will discuss the physiological and functional implications of our results."}
{"text":"\nWe have performed a three-nucleon measurement in the region of proton number excess, \u03a5(1\/3),  in the framework of the fashionable quark-meson coupling approach, QCD. We have investigated the structure of the three-nucleon system in the region of large pion masses, M\u03c0 > 1 GeV\/c2, in which the \u03a5(1\/3) state is expected to be particularly sensitive to the strong coupling effects. To our surprise, the results do not show any significant deviation from the standard coupled-channel approach, QCD, with the coupling constant, \u03b1s, set to the widely used value of 1\/10, and the mass of the pion, M\u03c0, set to the physical value, GeV\/c2. We have re-examined the theory in order to find any systematic effect which could explain our findings, but in spite of our efforts we have been unable to identify any such effect. We have also re-checked our experimental data in order to establish that no systematical effect due to the experimental set-up could have influenced the results. This leaves the problem of the large pion mass, M\u03c0 > 1 GeV\/c2, three-nucleon structure basically unsolved. We discuss the problem and possible ways to resolve it."}

{"text":"\n\nWe report on a new method for absorption spectroscopy of individual single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) using an ultrafast pulsed laser and a scheme to separate the absorption signal from the background due to optical scattering by randomly oriented CNTs in a solution. A strong and stable absorption signal from a single CNT was obtained for the first time, and the spectral features of the absorption band were clearly observed. Our results demonstrated that the absorbance of a single CNT has a Lorentzian profile with a peak wavelength ofannel, which is a signature of the electronic transition between the van Hove states. The full width half maximum of the absorption band was observed to be in the range of 0.6-2.0 nm, depending on the CNT structure. Our scheme for absorption spectroscopy of individual CNTs paves the way for a better understanding of the electronic structure and the optical properties of SWCNTs, which is important for the development of applications of CNTs such as optical sensors and photodetectors."}
{"text":"\nWe show that if the weak and strong interactions are included in a general framework of locally gauge invariant theories with fermionic flavours, the standard model (SM) is recovered as the unique theory with the correct number of quark and lepton generations, in agreement with the observed quark and lepton masses, and with the correct pattern of flavour changing couplings. The inclusion of the flavour changing couplings, in addition to the generation number, in the definition of the flavour structure of the theory allows to recover the SM as the unique theory consistent with the data, in the same way the SM recovery from the quark and lepton generations alone is not unique. We also show that the inclusion of the flavour changing couplings in the definition of the flavour structure implies the existence of a new very weak interaction which couples all the flavours to the same Yukawa and is related to the hierarchy problem. The new interaction is radiatively broken in the same way the electroweak symmetry is broken, and its Lagrangian has the same structure as the SM one, with a kinetic term and a scattering term related to the Yukawa coupling. We show that this new interaction is able to generate the non-hierarchical structure of the neutrinos and to solve the hierarchy problem in a natural way."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a statistical study of the alignment and signed-intensity anomalies in the WMAP data. We find that the alignment anomaly can be explained by a simple model in which the dipole moment of the CMB anisotropy is oriented along the ecliptic plane. We find that this explanation is in agreement with the observed correlation between the alignment anomaly and the inclination of the orbital plane of the Earth around the Sun, and the correlation between the alignment anomaly and the average position of the Sun on the sky. We find that the signed-intensity anomaly is in good agreement with a model in which the dipole moment of the CMB anisotropy is aligned in the direction of the equatorial plane, but its intensity is modulated by a dipole moment along the ecliptic plane. We also find that the level of the signed-intensity anomaly is in good agreement with a model in which the amplitude of the dipole moment along the equatorial plane is constant, but its intensity is modulated by a sinusoidal function with a period of one year. We find that this explanation is in agreement with the observed correlation between the signed-intensity anomaly and the position of the Sun on the sky."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present the first results from a programme to measure red galaxy clustering in the distant Universe using the AAOmega multi-object spectrograph on the Anglo-Australian Telescope. We have selected a sample of 73 galaxy redshifts in the z~0.7 Universe selected from an ultra-deep galaxy redshift survey using the 6dF instrument on the Anglo-Australian Telescope. We have measured the redshift distribution of the galaxies in the sample, and have found a strong correlation between local galaxy clustering and redshift. This correlation is shown to be consistent with a simple model in which galaxies are perfectly clustered in space and the Universe is spatially flat. In this model the correlation between local galaxy clustering and redshift is given by the density fluctuation spectrum, which has a power law index of 1.7 \u00b1 0.1. The observed correlation between local galaxy clustering and redshift is in good agreement with this simple model. We have also measured the redshift distribution of the correlation functions of the galaxies in the sample. We find that the local correlation function follows the same power law as the density fluctuation spectrum, but that the correlation function is significantly higher at high redshift than at low redshift. This is consistent with a simple model in which the correlation function is dominated by the large scale structure, and the correlation function at high redshift is simply the large scale correlation function at that redshift."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present results of a Suzaku hard X-ray observation of the nuclear region of the radio-loud active galaxy Centaurus A. The aim of the observation was to test the hypothesis that the accretion disk of the supermassive black hole, which is responsible for the nuclear emission, iswarmer than the gas in the surrounding bulge. We find that the accretion disk, if it exists, must be at least 4 kK cooler than the gas in the bulge. We also find that the gas in the bulge is at most 6 kK cooler than the gas in the disk. This result rules out the possibility that the gas in the bulge is heated by accretion, and therefore that the bulge is the accretion disk seen at a very large radius. We discuss this result in the framework of simple models of the nuclear region. In addition, we derive constraints on the abundances of the accreiting material, assuming that the gas in the disk is a combination of gas in the bulge and a flow derived from the intergalactic medium. We find that the accretion gas is most probably close to solar in composition, regardless of the origin of the gas in the disk."}
{"text":"\n\nWe propose a general and flexible framework for distributed algorithms for solving several important problems in wireless networks, such as spectrum allocation, power control, routing and congestion control. Our framework is based on the fusion of two ideas. The first one is to view the wireless networks as a special type of complex networks, where the links are formed by the interference relationship between the nodes, and the second one is to design distributed algorithms using only local information, in the spirit of the locally-Rendezvous-scheme. Our framework is general and flexible enough to be applied to different types of wireless networks, such as mobile ad hoc networks, wireless sensor networks and cellular networks. As an example, we apply our framework to the problem of joint spectrum allocation and power control in cognitive radio networks, and we show that our proposed algorithm achieves near-optimal performance while requiring very limited information exchange among the nodes."}
{"text":"\nWe introduce and study a new index, the clustering coefficient of a graph, which measures the density of triangles in the graph. We show that this index is a robust measure of the clustering of the graph, in the sense that it is insensitive to the details of the graph, provided that it is large enough. We apply this new index to protein-protein interaction networks, and show that it can be used to detect communities and to evaluate the significance of an observed community structure. We find that the clustering coefficients of real protein-protein interaction networks are significantly higher than random graphs with the same degree distribution, and we show this by using both a random graph generator and by generating all possible graphs with a given degree distribution. We show that this result is consistent with a model in which the proteins in a network tend to form communities of size three. We also find that the size of the largest community is a good measure of the complexity of the network."}
{"text":"\nWe consider a statistical ensemble of rotating black holes, for which the density distribution is known from recent numerical simulations. We show that the kinetic energy of this ensemble is non-vanishing, and find the distribution of the kinetic energy. We find that the most compact rotating ensemble has a unique energy distribution, and show that this distribution is in good agreement with the energy distribution found from a statistical ensemble of point-like particles at rest. This establishes the equipartition theorem for the kinetic energy of rotating black holes. We also consider a random ensemble of rotating black holes, and find that the equipartition theorem is not valid in this case. The difference between the two ensembles is the existence of a preferred rotation frequency in the first case, and the fact that the black holes in the second case can have any rotation frequency. We show that the kinetic energy of the random ensemble has a cut-off frequency, and that this is responsible for the breakdown of the equipartition theorem."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider the problem of characterizing the structures of polymer chains in solutions as they flow through narrow capillaries. We employ a combination of experimental measurements and theory to obtain a detailed understanding of the correlation functions that describe the ordered structures that are formed. In particular, we consider the cases of strong and weak entanglement, and for chains with and without attractive end-groups. We find that in all cases the correlations decay much more rapidly than the ballistic correlations that are expected for fully disordered structures. This rapid decay is understood in terms of a simple model in which the polymers form a tangled network in the interior of the capillary, while the correlations along the capillary axis are mostly determined by the interface between the solvent and the capillary wall. We show that this model can quantitatively describe the experimental data, and we discuss the implications of our results for the confinement of other types of soft matter."}
{"text":"\nWe consider the consistency between the renormalization group running of the chiral operator and the counting rule for the case of the chiral pion production operator. Renormalization group running is not unique because it depends on the choice of the intermediate basis. The usual basis of the chiral pion production operator is the one that diagonalizes the kernel of the renormalization group transformation represented by the index translation. The index translation is related to the counting rule in the following way: The index translation acts as the translation of the vacuum by the number of the elementary excitations of the chiral matter. In our case the elementary excitations are represented by the pions. We show that the renormalization group running of the chiral pion production operator is consistent with the counting rule if and only if the renormalization group transformation is related to the index translation by the rule which translates the vacuum by the number of the pions which are not included in the basis of the chiral matter."}

A central task in the analysis of networks is to find communities, or groups of nodes that are highly connected to each other and relatively separate from the rest of the network.

{"text":"\n\nGeometry-induced asymmetric diffusion\n\nWe consider statistical mechanics models of geometries of regular regions (defect-free regions) on a lattice and the diffusive transport of particles on these lattices. We find that the thermal conductivity is asymmetric with respect to the flip of the geometry of the regions. The intriguing phenomenon we observe is that the thermal conductivity of the lattice with the geometry of the regions reversed is lower than the thermal conductivity of the original lattice. We show this to be a general feature of lattices with an even number of regions. We find the transition temperature above which the thermal conductivity becomes symmetric as the square of the thermal conductivity of the lattice with the regions in their original geometry. The flip of the geometry of the regions introduces an additional free parameter in the model, and we study the statistics of this free parameter. We show that the standard deviation of this free parameter has a simple expression in terms of the thermal conductivity. Our results suggest a possible route to engineer the thermal conductivity of a lattice by geometry."}
{"text":"\nWe have performed a detailed theoretical study of the structure and dynamics of quarkonia in quark-gluon plasma. We find that the quarkonia structure is significantly influenced by the dynamic evolution of the quark-gluon plasma. In particular, we show that the width of the quarkonia droplets increases with the increase of the number of constituent quarks. This is in strong contrast to the quarkonia structure in the hadron gas, where the width of the quarkonia droplets is proportional to the square of the number of constituent quarks. We show that this difference is due to the fact that the quark-antiquark pairs are much more tightly coupled in the quark-gluon plasma than in the hadron gas. As a result, the strong binding energy of the quarkonia droplets makes them less likely to break up even when they are subjected to large thermal fluctuations. We also show that the average number of constituent quarks per quarkonia droplet is smaller in the quark-gluon plasma than in the hadron gas. This is due to the fact that the quark-antiquark pairs are more likely to separate from each other in the quark-gluon plasma than in the hadron gas."}
{"text":"\nWe present a study of the evolution of complex behaviors in the finitary process soup, a simple abstract model of evolutionary systems. We show that a large class of behavior-substrate pairs leads to a victorian explosion of behavior, a phenomenon in which new behaviors rapidly overpopulate the space of behaviors, and then slowly die out, with the population of behaviors eventually converging to a stationary distribution. We show that the dynamics of this process is in fact the dynamics of an associated generalized finitary model, a generalization of the finitary process soup to allow for behaviors with non-trivial structure. We then consider the evolution of more complex behaviors, and show that the same dynamics applies, with the additional feature that the limit distribution of behaviors is not stationary, but rather evolving in a manner that depends on the original behavior-substrate pair. We then consider the evolution of still more complex behaviors, and show that this evolution is more complicated, with the additional feature that the evolved behaviors are not always the most fit for the environment, but rather that the most fit behaviors are selected with a probability that depends on their fitness. We finally consider a more general model of behavior evolution that allows for any possible dynamics of behavior change, and show that this model is well-behaved, with the additional feature that the evolved behaviors are not always the most fit for the environment, but rather that the most fit behaviors are selected with a probability that depends on their fitness."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present high-resolution observations of the gas in the outflow from the quasar 8CSailf10, obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope. These observations show a clear signature of a close-in accretion disc: a Keplerian velocity distribution and a correlation between gas and dust. The gas distribution is however different from that expected if the gas was simply flowing away from the accretion disc, as it is more extended and has a higher velocity component in the radial direction. We explain this discrepancy by a model in which the gas is rotating around the disc, constrained by the disc's gravitational potential, and in which the gas flow is accelerating because the gas is being pulled out of the disc. This model can also explain the strong correlation between gas and dust, as the dust is expected to be dynamically coupled to the gas. The derived mass-flow rate is  \u223c 3.5 M\u2299 yr-1, consistent with the value derived from observations of the dust, and the acceleration of the gas is  \u223c 5 \u2212 10 m s-1. We find that this model can also explain the observations of several other quasars, in particular quasars with outflow masses between  \u223c 1 \u2212 10 M\u2299 yr-1, and accelerations of  \u223c 1 \u2212 10 m s-1. We discuss a possible physical explanation for these observations, involving a Keplerian disc with many viscosity bumps, and a large-scale potential well created by the central supermassive black hole."}
{"text":"\nWe present a new method to construct closures for the turbulent subgrid-scale stress tensor based on matrix exponential calculations. The motivation for this work is to provide a basis for an unified framework to derive all the different closures that have been proposed in the literature. This is achieved by introducing the concept of different correlation functions which have a one-to-one correspondence with the different closures. The main idea is to use the matrix exponential to convolve the correlation functions with the wavelet basis and keep the resulting infinite-dimensional vector fixed as a new basis for the stress tensor. This basis is orthonormal in a suitable inner product and thus any linear combination of the basis elements corresponds to a possible closure. We show that for a general correlation function the resulting basis is not orthonormal and thus not suitable as a basis for the stress tensor. However, we show that this problem can be circumvented by using a so-called rebels basis. We demonstrate that all the common closures can be expressed in this framework and provide a simple and unified derivation of all the different closures."}

{"text":"\nWe consider next-to-leading order (NLO) corrections to exclusive processes in $k_T$ factorization and find that they can be computed exactly in the limit of large $\\alpha_s$. The main tool is the so-called Custodial Jacobi transformation, which expresses the NLO correction to a given exclusive process in terms of the NLO correction to an associated inclusive process. In this way, the NLO corrections to exclusive processes can be derived from the exact NLO corrections to inclusive processes, as recently done in the quarkonia framework. Our approach is more general and can be applied to any exclusive process. We evaluate the NLO correction to the exclusive $J\/\\Psi$ process and find that it is small in the limit $\\alpha_s \\gg 1$ and can be neglected as compared to the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) correction, which has a substantial higher-order contribution. The smallness of the NLO correction to $J\/\\Psi$ is confirmed by comparing our results with previous calculations based on the quarkonia framework."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a Gaussian-basis Monte Carlo method for numerical study on ground states of itinerant and strongly correlated electron systems. The method is based on the use of Gaussian random numbers, which enables an exact evaluation of the mean-square violation of the various conservation laws.

The results show that the method is very efficient and accurate.\n\nThe method can be used to study systems for which an exact solution is not known. As an example we consider the three-dimensional (3d) Mott insulator CeCoIn5. The results show that the method is able to give a good description of the ground state, in spite of the strong spin-orbit coupling and the large number of spin-orbital states, which causes a strong symmetry breaking of the ground state.\n\nThe method can also be used to study more complex systems, such as the 3d Ising antiferromagnet NiO. In this case the method is not exact, but it gives a very good approximation of the ground state. The method is also applied to the study of the spectral functions of the states, which are found to be in very good agreement with the results obtained by using the mean-field theory."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a systematic study of the work function in a class of model systems which we term analogues of the Schottky barrier. These systems consist of a semiconductor with a surface adsorbate or a semiconductor with a carefully designed surface layer. In both cases the work function is controlled by a single parameter, the bulk carrier concentration. We show that the work function in these systems is related to the surface states by a simple and general formula which has only two arbitrary parameters. The work function of these systems is determined by the bulk carrier concentration in agreement with the Wannier-Stark theory. We also show that the electronic states in the surface layer are described by a set of basis functions which are related to the molecular orbitals of the adsorbates. We discuss the relation between the basis functions and the molecular orbitals, and we show that the basis functions are unique in the absence of a priori information. We also show that the basis functions have a simple and general form which can be derived from the molecular orbitals."}
{"text":"\nWe propose a new model for the acceleration of particles in the annular gap between a rotating and a stationary conductor, which can be used to explain the basic features of the pulsar $\\gamma$-ray emission, in particular the temperature dependence and the fast rise of the emission. Our model is based on a rigorous solution of the 2-dimensional hydrodynamic equations for the conservation of the mass and the momentum, which are valid in the gap for all conductor temperatures. The model predicts that the temperature dependence of the $\\gamma$-ray flux is related to the transition between the convection and the ballistic regime. We show that the ballistic regime is characterized by a constant flux level, independent of the temperature. Within this regime the temperature may have a strong influence on the energy distribution of the $\\gamma$-ray emission. Our model also explains the fast rise of the $\\gamma$-ray flux, if the particle acceleration is caused by a shock, induced by the plasma instability at the boundary between the rotating and the stationary conductor. We discuss the problem of the energy distribution of the $\\gamma$-ray emission and we show that a simple analytical model, based on the assumption of a Maxwellian energy distribution, is consistent with our basic model."}
{"text":"\n\nAtomic data from the Iron Project. LXIV. Radiative transition rates and collision strengths for Ca II\n\nWe present new empirical formulas for the radiative transition rates and collision strengths of the lowest five levels of the Ca II multiplet in the 1.5-3.4 keV region. The formulas are based on a complete evaluation of the relevant atomic data, including new measurement of the hyperfine structure constants and new calculations of the permanent dipole moment, which were performed as part of the Iron Project. The measurement of the hyperfine structure constants was performed by measuring the polarization of Ca II with a wave plate in front of a Ca K spectrometer. The accuracy of the measurement was evaluated by measuring the same constants in a separate experiment using a fully stabilized beam. The new calculations of the permanent dipole moment were performed with the aid of an atomic structure model based on the most recent shell-model calculations. The resulting dipole moment is in excellent agreement with recent measurements. We have derived new formulas for the radiative transition rates and collision strengths based on a formalism that includes all relevant atomic data. The accuracy of the new formulas is estimated to be about 10%."}
{"text":"\n\nOn Gene Duplication Models for Evolving Regulatory Networks\n\nRegulatory networks control gene expression by regulating the binding of transcription factors to DNA. They are a central organizing principle in biology, and their dynamics are thought to be critical for the evolution of many complex traits. We study regulatory evolution by asking how gene duplications affect the architecture of regulatory networks. We focus on the evolution of gene expression levels, which are often highly heritable and have important fitness consequences. We develop a new model that enables us to study the dynamics of gene expression levels in the presence of gene duplications. We find that gene duplications have complex effects on gene expression levels, and in many cases can drive them to evolve in an optimizing direction. We show that this effect can be understood by considering both the direct effect of duplicating a gene, and the indirect effects of duplicating regulatory connections that influence the expression of the gene. Our model also makes specific predictions about the evolutionary dynamics of gene expression levels, which we test using a combination of computational and experimental methods. Our results suggest that these predictions could be used to distinguish between different gene duplication models."}
{"text":"\nWe study the ground state of positronium in the framework of the relativistic Schr\u00f6dinger theory. The usual procedure to find the ground state of a relativistic system is to solve the Dirac equation for the governing motion, then use the resulting energy levels as initial guesses for the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for the bound state. We show that this procedure is not appropriate for positronium, because the ground state of the Dirac equation is not a valid initial guess for the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. We derive a systematic method to find the ground state of positronium that is based on the construction of a basis for the state space of the bound system. In this basis the ground state is the only state with zero total momentum. This basis is constructed using the so-called symbolic solution of the Dirac equation. The symbolic solution of the Dirac equation is known in the literature, but has not been applied to this problem. We evaluate the ground state energy and find that it is in very good agreement with the result of the static Schr\u00f6dinger theory, which has been verified experimentally."}
{"text":"\nWe present a detailed study of the curious case of NGC 6908, a low-mass star-forming region in the outer parts of the Milky Way. We have conducted a systematic search for young stellar objects in the region, and have found a large number of candidate objects with ages on the order of 10-20 million years. The objects have been detected through the 1.3 mm wavelength of the CO2 emission line, which is strong in the cold outer reaches of the galaxy. We have characterized the kinematics and chemical properties of the region, and have found that it is surprisingly chemically rich, with a wide range of elements detected in the gas. In addition, we have found a large number of molecular clouds in the region, some of which are extremely cold and dense. We have identified a large number of potential sites for future star formation, and have found that the region is likely to be a significant site for star formation in the future. We have also found a number of exotic objects in the region, including a number of potential brown dwarfs. Our results suggest that the region is a unique and potentially important site for future star formation."}
{"text":"\nWe consider the analytic approach to the thermal Casimir force between a metal and a dielectric in the presence of a long-range Coulomb field. The integral representation of the dynamic Green function is constructed by the means of the spherical-wave expansion in the plasma frequency of the metal and the static limit is obtained. We evaluate the thermal Casimir force between the metal and the dielectric in the presence of a long-range Coulomb field and find that this force is proportional to the cube of the inverse of the thermal plasma frequency of the metal and the dielectric. The analytical expressions for the bound and unbound components of the thermal Casimir force are obtained. Our analytical approach allows us to find the conditions of the strong binding of the dielectric to the metal and the loose binding of the dielectric to the metal. We analyze the role of the dielectric in the heat transfer process and find that the dielectric does not change the heat transfer process in the limit of the weak binding to the metal."}
{"text":"\n\nWe show that non-coding DNA, such as introns and regulatory sequences, have properties that enable them to carry information and perform the basic functions of coding DNA, such as expressing adaptation and its universal laws. We found that non-coding DNA has a high information content and low complexity, similar to coding DNA. It can express combinatorial and complex functions, such as the coordination of gene expression and the regulation of development, in a similar way as coding DNA. We found that the combination of the information and low complexity properties of non-coding DNA are sufficient to express adaptation and its universal laws, such as the genetic algorithm and the Darwinian evolution. We suggest that non-coding DNA was the evolutionary precursor of coding DNA and that the evolution of life is an algorithm that is expressed on the non-coding DNA. Our findings suggest a simple explanation to the origin of life and its evolutionary development, based on the ability of non-coding DNA to store and process information. We suggest that the future study of non-coding DNA will lead to a better understanding of life and its evolution."}
{"text":"\n\nWe study the relation between gauge symmetry and the structure of odd manifolds in the context of Kitaev-type spin models. We show that the common belief that the symmetry of such models is tightly related to the existence of a symmetry group acting on the spins of the model is not correct. We show that the underlying group of the gauge symmetry of a model can be an infinite analog of the symmetry group of the spins, in the sense that it acts on the sets of spins by taking the ordinary symmetric group SO(n) to the symmetric group SO(n+1). We show further that this result does not imply the existence of an action of the underlying group on the spins. As an application, we give a description of the set of index theorems on odd manifolds in terms of the properties of the discriminant of a trilinear form on the constituent vector space of a representation. We show that this description provides a natural way of classifying the index theorems on odd manifolds according to the symmetry of the underlying group."}
{"text":"\nWe study the evolution of magnetic turbulence in relativistic collisionless shocks, modeled as electron-positron plasmas with constant but different thermal plasma parameters. We find that in the early evolution of the shock, when the electrons and positrons are still relatively far from each other, the turbulence is driven by the pairwise collisions between the particles. When the particles get closer to each other and the collisional broadenings of the electron and positron distributions become comparable, the turbulence becomes driven by the thermal plasma motions. The most efficient way to drive turbulence is by a correlations mechanism, where a thermal plasma fluctuation in one part of the shock creates a pressure gradient, which in its turn induces a correlated thermal fluctuation in another part of the shock. We also found the evolution of the structure function coefficients to be in agreement with the predictions of the theoretical model by Schreiber & Weiss (2009), who derived an analytical expression for the structure function coefficients in collisionless shocks."}

{"text":"\nWe consider the interaction of a small charge with a thin plasma sheet. The plasma sheet is treated as a transparent shield in the electrostatic sense, so that the electric field is only slightly disturbed by the presence of the plasma sheet. This is different from the situation where the plasma sheet is very dense and reflects the electric field, as in a plasma mirror. The thin plasma sheet is often found in space plasma phenomena, such as the solar wind, the Earth's magnetosphere, and the ionosphere. The simplest case is considered, where the plasma sheet is a plane layer, the thickness of which is much smaller than the characteristic plasma wavelength. We show that the thickness of the plasma sheet has a considerable influence on the interaction of the charge with the plasma sheet. The most interesting case is when the thickness is comparable to the plasma wavelength. Under this condition, the energy absorption by the plasma sheet is maximum, and the transmitted energy is minimum. We also found that the frequency of the incident wave has no influence on the energy absorption by the plasma sheet."}

{"text":"\n\nThe Statistics of Supersonic Isothermal Turbulence\n\nWe present a method for characterizing the statistics of isothermal turbulence in a supersonic flow. Our approach is based on performing multiple polls of the flow velocity distribution at a single point. Each poll consists of measuring the two-dimensional velocity distribution over a small area, and repeating this measurement at different downstream locations. Our method is similar to the traditional technique of performing a single poll of the flow velocity distribution at multiple points. By repeating the same poll many times at a single point, we obtain a large amount of data with a high signal-to-noise ratio, and can therefore accurately determine the velocity distribution even in the presence of highly non-Gaussian fluctuations. We demonstrate the applicability of our method by analyzing both direct numerical simulations and large-eddy simulation data. In the analysis of the numerical simulation data, we consider the case of a mean flow that is either uniform or accelerated in the streamwise direction. We show that our method can be used to accurately characterize the mean and variance of the velocity distribution even in the presence of strong non-Gaussian effects. We also show that our method can be used to determine the optimal turbulence intensity measure in the presence of non-Gaussian fluctuations."}
{"text":"\nWe study the influence of a rigidly-held plane on the dynamics of a shallow granular layer resting on a rigid foundation. The system is excited vertically and the corresponding wave equation is solved analytically. We find a strong difference between the situations where the plane is located at the top or bottom of the layer. In the former case, the system is in a state of quasi-equilibrium, with the acceleration of the granular material being proportional to the vertical displacement given by the wave equation. This is similar to the case of a vertically-oscillated rigid plane on a liquid, where the notion of criticality has been developed. By contrast, when the plane is located at the bottom of the layer, the system is in a state of complete chaos, with the acceleration of the granular material being proportional to the square of the vertical displacement given by the wave equation. Our results suggest that the state of criticality may be achieved by a continuous adjustment of the height of the plane within the granular layer."}
{"text":"\n\nMultiple Routes for Glutamate Receptor Trafficking: Surface Diffusion\nand Membrane Traffic Cooperate to Bring Receptors to Synapses\n\nThe formation of synaptic connections is a powerful mechanism for\ninformation processing and memory formation. At the receiving side of a\nsynapse, the postsynaptic specialization (PSP) contains molecular\nstructures that are highly adapted to the needs of the synapse:\nexcitatory glutamate receptors (GluRs) for fast synaptic transmission\nand principal stages of synaptic plasticity, and depressory GABA receptors\nfor inhibition. Both glutamate and GABA receptors are transmembrane\n proteins, which makes their synaptic insertion a complex process\n requiring several different membrane trafficking steps. At the same time,\nPSPs are very dynamic structures, able to quickly form and dissolve\n synapses throughout postnatal development as well as in response to\nsynaptic activity. Here we show that surface diffusion is a surprisingly\nimportant factor for the localization of both glutamate and GABA\nreceptors in the PSP. We find that the diffusion of receptors from the\n extracellular space to the synaptic membrane is fastest for receptors\n located in the postsynaptic shaft, a feature which could explain why\nsynaptic receptors are preferentially inserted in the synaptic cleft.\nInterestingly, we also find that the diffusion of transmembrane proteins\n in the synaptic membrane is directed toward the synaptic cleft,\n suggesting that a molecular gradient of an unknown nature could exist in\n the synaptic membrane, possibly to provide directionality to the\n diffusion of synaptic receptors. We discuss the impact of these\n findings for our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of synaptic\n plasticity."}
{"text":"\nWe have developed a single-molecule technique to study the dynamics of protein diffusion in the plasma membrane. Using a generic peptide anchor, we can decorate a large number of lipid molecules with a bulky fluorescent probe, allowing us to visualize the diffusion of individual molecules in the plane of the membrane. Our results show that diffusion is restricted to a small number of preferred directions, indicating that the membrane is highly ordered. We observed the diffusion of probes to be on average four times slower along the direction of the helices of the lipid bilayer than perpendicular to it, consistent with diffusion being highly anisotropic. We could also detect diffusion barriers with a height of up to 1.5 times the thickness of the lipid bilayer, which correspond to the spacing between cholesterol-rich domains. Our results suggest that diffusion in the plasma membrane is restricted by the presence of highly ordered structures, such as lipid rafts, and diffusion barriers, such as cholesterol-rich domains."}
{"text":"\n\nDirect imaging of lateral movements of AMPA receptors inside synapses\n\nWe have developed a method to directly observe the lateral movements of synaptic proteins in a living synapse. We used a highly selective antibody against the C-terminal domain of GluA1, an AMPA receptor subunit, to visualize the internalization and diffusion of synaptic AMPA receptors in hippocampal neurons. Our results show that internalized receptors move bidirectionally within synapses, and that this movement is regulated by synaptic activity. We observed that a transient decrease in synaptic transmission to a synapse significantly reduces the number of mobile receptors, whereas a transient increase in synaptic transmission increases the number of mobile receptors. We also observed that a synapse-specific protein, synaptotagmin 9 (Syt9), is involved in the directional movement of AMPA receptors. These results provide a new view of the role of synaptic activity in the distribution of synaptic receptors. We suggest that synaptic activity can determine the local abundance of AMPA receptors in synapses, which may be important for synaptic plasticity."}
{"text":"\nWe consider a model of interacting identical particles in a (2+1)-dimensional gonihedric lattice, that exhibits a rich variety of phases, including a Lifshitz point at (d,m)=(3,2), which is also the uniquetotemicontinuous symmetry (2,3)=(4,6)=(3,2) point in this dimension. We show that the multicriticality is associated with the existence of a scalar singlet quasiparticle with a non-zero weight in the ground state. The weight of this quasiparticle is related to the lifetime of the excitations in the ground state, which is found to be infinite for a large class of initial conditions. We show that this infinite lifetime is a consequence of the fact that the excitations in the ground state are localized at the Lifshitz point. For another class of initial conditions, the lifetime of the excitations is finite. In both cases the dynamics is continuous. For the case of a finite lifetime we determine analytically the elementary excitations of the model, and show that the dynamics is robust with respect to small perturbations. We also show that a small extension of the model can realize a Lifshitz point with a finite non-zero weight, which is related to the (d,m)=(3,2) point in (2+1)-dimesional space-time."}
{"text":"\n\nWe have investigated a quantum system comprising of a single electron and a single photon, which is dynamically coupled to a thermal reservoir and a local optical phonon. The system is modeled by the effective two-dimensional (2D) nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation with a dissipative term that includes both the finite resistivity and the scattering by the optical phonon. We found a clear signature of the enhanced Kondo effect in the steady state of the system, which has a distinct dependence on the strength of the coupling to the phonon. We explain this effect by the enhanced stability of the single-particle basis renormalization, which in turn depends on the phonon-induced symmetry breaking. We also found a strong enhancement of the temperature dependence of the zero-frequency limit, which can be understood by the presence of an additional term in the dissipative kernel, which is related to the electron-phonon coupling. Our results may be useful in the study of various exotic phenomena related to the interplay between different degrees of freedom in a multi-particle system."}
{"text":"\nWe propose and analyze a game-theoretic approach to energy-efficient modulation in CDMA networks with delay constraints. We consider a setting where the base stations of a CDMA network are subject to power constraints, while the mobile terminals are subject to delay constraints. The base stations and the mobile terminals can choose from a finite set of modulation and coding schemes, with the goal of maximizing the network throughput while minimizing the energy consumption and the delay. We model the problem as a non-cooperative game, where the base stations and the mobile terminals are players who compete for the network resources. The game is played in rounds, where each round corresponds to a frame of the CDMA network. We define a utility function that captures the trade-off between the energy consumption, the delay, and the throughput, and use this utility function to model the behavior of the players. We analyze the game-theoretic approach using a simulation-based method, and show that the proposed approach achieves a near-optimal performance."}
{"text":"\n\nWe propose a novel energy-efficient resource allocation strategy for wireless networks with Quality-of-Service (QoS) constraints.

We propose a general framework for joint optimization of resource allocation and network coding that is applicable to a broad range of wireless network architectures and many types of QoS constraints. In our framework, the BS formulates the joint optimization problem as a bilevel program and then solve it using a generalized Benders decomposition algorithm.

{"text":"\n\nWe propose a unified approach to energy-efficient power control (EPC) in large code division multiple access (CDMA) systems. The proposed approach is based on a rigorous analysis of the performance of the direct-sequence (DS)-CDMA uplink, which is shown to be throughput-driven in the large system regime. An algorithm for computing the optimal per-user uplink power control (ULPC) step size is then derived. The proposed algorithm has a number of key advantages. First, it provides a closed-form expression for the optimal ULPC step size. Second, the optimal step size depends only on the long-term average of the total base station transmit power and the long-term average of the noise rise, both of which can be computed in advance. Third, the proposed step size has a smooth average behavior that is shown to minimize the steady-state ULPC overhead. Finally, the proposed algorithm can be implemented using a number of simple techniques, which are shown to provide almost the same performance. The performance of the proposed EPC algorithm is validated through computer simulations."}
{"text":"\n\nA high-precision astrometry on the VLT\/FORS1 at time scales of few days\n\nWe present high-precision photometry and astrometry of 7995 stars observed with the VLT\/FORS1 over a time scale of a few days. The observations were made in service mode with a typical seeing of  \u223c 1.5'' during a period of very good observing conditions, with more than 80% of the time lost due to clouds. The catalogue contains 6 governmental stars, 618 planets, 891 stars brighter than R = 11, and 5408 fainter stars, for a total of 6988 stars. The achieved precision is  \u223c 0.8'' for the stars brighter than 11th magnitude and  \u223c 1.5'' for the fainter stars. We find a non-systematic difference of  \u223c 1'' between the north and south sides of the VLT\/FORS1 field. The use of an image derotator to remove the seeing-induced image motion is discussed. We show that the precision can be significantly improved by taking the background emission from the reference stars into account. We present a simple method to derive a 1-D correction map for the non-linearity of the guiding algorithm, and we evaluate the effect of this non-linearity on our astrometry. We find that this correction has only a small effect on the precision of our astrometry."}

{"text":"\n\nWe consider the spacetime structure in the theory of gravitation of Einstein and Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m (ERN) based on the tetrad formalism. The motivation for this work is to obtain a clear physical interpretation of the ERN spacetime structure which is different from that of the Einstein- Hilbert action. As a result, we find that the ERN spacetime is nothing but the spacetime described by the Riemann-Christoffel tetrad in the sense that the connection defined by the Christoffel symbol is the same as the one defined by the Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m metric. We show that the physical meaning of the Christoffel symbols in the tetrad formulation is related to the torsion of the principal bundle of the spacetime. Further, the Christoffel symbols are related to the electromagnetic field. We find that the torsion of the spacetime principal bundle is proportional to the electromagnetic field. This torsion is related to the torsion of the Dirac operator. Further, we discuss the nature of the mass in the ERN theory.

{"text":"\n\nWe have performed a parameter study of the effect of extragalactic background light (EBL) on the observations of weakly emitting galaxies in the same volume. We have considered the EBL produced by the galaxies in a foreground group, the EBL from the diffuse light of the group and the EBL from the rest of the Universe. We have found that the EBL produces a significant drop in the detectability of the weak galaxies, especially in groups with a large number of galaxies and in groups which are very distant. We have also found that the group EBL has a large impact on the detectability and the colour of the weak galaxies, whereas the EBL from the rest of the Universe has a very small impact. We have interpreted our results in the framework of the 'Cascading' mechanism. Our results show that the galaxies which are close to the edge of the group can be severely affected by the EBL, and therefore the galaxies which are far from the group centre are more easily detectable. This is in agreement with the hypothesis that the galaxies which are the first to be detected are the galaxies which are the farthest from the group. We have also found that the EBL has a larger impact on the blue galaxies and on the galaxies which are already quite faint. The EBL thus produces a significant modification of the colour distribution of the galaxies, and this modification is able to improve the detectability of the galaxies which are close to the detection limit."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present an overview of the HYDE-PARC project, an effort to combine the N-body synthetic galaxy generation code HYDE with the stellar population synthesis code PARC.

We discuss the details of the fitting procedure, and show that our synthetic galaxy catalog is able to reproduce the observed distribution of galaxies in groups and filaments, the observed correlation function, and the observed distribution of galaxies in color space. We have compared our results to those obtained with the widely used synthetic galaxy catalog GMP, and found that the HYDE-PARC catalog produces a significantly better fit to the observations.

{"text":"\nWe investigate the generation of gravito-Alfven waves (GAWs) in solar-type stars. We find that the outward-propagating GAWs can be generated by over-reflection of Alfv\u00e9n waves (AWs) at the inner edge of the boundary layer (BL) when the forcing is directed along the star's rotation axis. We also find that the generation rate is sensitive to the stellar rotation frequency, and that the inner BL can become unstable to the generation of GAWs when the forcing frequency is close to the rotation frequency. We show that the quasistationary structure of the unstable BL is characterized by the presence of a standing GAW, and that the transition to the unstable state is accompanied by a change in the dominant mode of the GAW from a pure Alfv\u00e9nic mode to a damped Alfv\u00e9nic mode with a substantial slow-mode component. The properties of the unstable BL are consistent with the formation of a rotating barrel structure. We find that the standing GAW is stable against the AWs that are generated by the forcing. Therefore, the outer edge of the BL can be considered as a boundary for the GAWs, and the BL itself as a waveguide for the AWs. Within this picture, we derive a simple expression for the coupling coefficient between the forcing and the generated GAWs. We also derive a simple expression for the critical frequency, below which the inner BL becomes unstable to the generation of GAWs. We show that these expressions are consistent with the available numerical and theoretical results."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present the results of a large scale numerical simulation study of the distribution of dark matter in the Milky Way. We have performed a series of N-body\/hydrodynamic simulations with different initial conditions and parameters to study the evolution of the distribution of dark matter and gas in the Milky Way. We show that the distribution of dark matter in the Galactic halo is well described by a model in which the matter is initially uniformly distributed in a sphere and then allowed to evolve according to the laws of Newtonian gravity. The distribution of gas in the Galactic halo, on the other hand, is much more sensitive to the initial conditions and to the physical processes that are included in the simulation. In particular, we find that the inclusion of dynamical friction and of a feedback from the gas distribution to the evolution of the gravitational potential is necessary to obtain a gas distribution that is consistent with observations. We have compared the mass distribution of our simulated galaxies with the observed distribution of dark matter in the Galactic halo, and we find that our models are consistent with the observations only if we include a significant clumping of the dark matter along with a much faster relaxation time of the gravitational potential than what is expected from a simple N-body calculation. This result suggests that a significant part of the dark matter in the Galactic halo has formed in relatively recent times, through the clumping together of large amounts of matter that was initially uniformly distributed."}
{"text":"\nThe KATRIN sensitivity to the neutrino mass and to right-handed currents in beta decay\n  The neutrino mass is a violation of the Standard Model (SM) and can be probed by the measure-ment of the ratio \ue0c1Meb\/\ue0c1Meu, where e and u are the SM generations of elementary fermions. The smallest such ratio is expected to be found in beta decays with a very light neutrino mass and a heavy partner (e.g. a charged lepton). The current best prediction for the neutrino mass is \ue0c1Mnu \u223c 1 eV. A large excess of events in the final state with two energetic electrons in the KATRIN experiment would unambiguously indicate the presence of a non-SM neutrino mass \ue0c1Mnu > 1 eV.\n  A non-SM right-handed neutrino current in the beta decay could be searched for by looking for a significant excess of events with a final state containing two electrons and two jets, where the two electrons are produced from the decay of a charged lepton. The search strategy is to use the fact that the flavor changing processes are strictly forbidden in the SM, therefore any significant departure from the SM expectation would be a clear sign of new physics.\n  We show that the proposed KATRIN experiment is sensitive to a right-handed neutrino current in the beta decay, if the neutrino mass is \ue0c1Mnu > 10 GeV. A small excess of events with two electrons and two jets would already be an indication of a non-SM neutrino mass \ue0c1Mnu > 10 GeV."}
{"text":"\n\nWe introduce a technique for combining two fundamental concepts of formal system theory, namely (termination) proof checking and ( Fixpoint ) model checking. The motivation for this work is the fact that termination can be viewed as an automatically generated ( recursive ) bisimulation class, and the question arises whether the technique of model checking can be used to automatically check the termination of a system. Our main result is that this is not possible in general, but that it is possible to construct a class of logic programs for which termination can be checked efficiently by model checking. We show how this result can be used to extract a class of logic programs for which the question of whether a program has an infinite execution can be answered by model checking. We also consider a more general setting, in which the class of systems for which model checking can answer the question of termination is significantly enlarged. In this setting, we show how to reduce the problem of termination to a problem of model checking."}
{"text":"\nWe present the first statistical study of the large-scale distribution of bimodal active galactic nuclei (AGN) in galaxies. Our sample comprises 25 galaxies with 2+xPop populations selected from the 2Mic catalog, which contains spectroscopic information for \u223c150k galaxies in the local volume. We find a clear over-abundance of bimodal AGN in galaxies with two distinct stellar populations (75% of our sample), compared to galaxies with a single stellar population (25% of our sample). We show this result is statistically robust by comparing to the simulated distribution of bimodal AGN expected from a statistical model of bimodal galaxies with a single stellar population. The bimodal AGN are found to reside in the older, more massive stellar population in the dual-population galaxies, suggesting a correlation between the stellar and AGN mass. We also find that the fraction of the galaxy's stellar mass contained in the older population is predictive of the likelihood of finding a bimodal AGN in the galaxy. We conclude that a large population of old stars is a major requirement for the formation of a bimodal AGN, and that the physical mechanisms responsible for the formation of these dual-black-hole systems are likely to be linked to the properties of the older stellar populations."}
{"text":"\n\nWe introduce a separability criterion for multipartite quantum states based on the Bloch representation of density matrices. The motivation for this work is the fact that, while the separability criterion for bipartite quantum states is well-known and widely used, a similar criterion for multipartite states is not available, despite the fact that such states occur naturally in many physical systems. The key idea is to use the Bloch representation to decompose a density matrix into a direct sum of simpler density matrices, each of which is either completely separable or at most a singlet state. The methodology is to use the Jordan decomposition to reduce the density matrix to a matrix with only diagonal blocks, which can then be further reduced to a direct sum of blocks that are either completely separable or at most a singlet state. The results obtained are that the proposed criterion is satisfied by any multipartite state that is either completely separable or at most a singlet state. The problem the work attempts to solve is to provide a separability criterion for multipartite quantum states that is as simple and straightforward as the criterion for bipartite states. The practical application of the work is that it provides a way to test whether a given multipartite state is separable or not, which could be useful in the study of multipartite quantum systems. The theoretical application of the work is that it provides a way to classify multipartite quantum states according to their level of separability, which could be useful in the study of the properties of quantum systems with more than two participants."}

As for the CRs, we show that the spectral distribution of CRs is consistent with the picture that the supergravity (SG) scale is close to the CR energy scale, provided that the mass of the lightest SUSY particle (LSP) is not heavier than a few TeV. We also show that the pattern of the primary and secondary CRs is consistent with the picture that the world-line of the CRs is affected by a small-scale (60-120GeV) Brantian symmetry, provided that the LSP mass is not heavier than a few TeV.

The effect of the U\/Si ratio on the film composition and microstructure was studied in the 2\u20133 nm thickness range. The films were found to exhibit columnar growth. The column diameter and spacing were dependent on the U\/Si ratio. The films were relatively amorphous with a high density of grain boundaries and twin planes. The electrical properties of the films were found to be highly dependent on the composition and microstructure of the film. The dielectric constant was found to increase with increasing U\/Si ratio. The films were also found to exhibit a negative temperature coefficient of resistance. The use of a nitrogen plasma in the UN deposition process was found to have a beneficial effect on the structural and electrical properties of the films."}
{"text":"\n\nWe develop a simple model of a short DNA molecule that captures many of the key physical features necessary to understand the bending and stretching of DNA as well as the movement of DNA along a filament. The model is based on the idea that the DNA molecule is a worm-like chain, with a bending rigidity that is inversely proportional to the fourth power of its length. We solve analytically the equation for the center of mass of the worm-like chain and show that the solution is very similar to the solution for a flexible rod that is compatible with the observations of DNA in a gel. In particular, we show that the persistence length, which characterizes the stretchiness of the DNA, is inversely proportional to the length of the DNA molecule. We also derive a simple expression for the velocity of the center of mass of the DNA molecule as it moves along a filament, and show that it is inversely proportional to the square of the persistence length. We analyze the experimental data of DNA moving on a nanotube in light of our theory, and show that our theory can quantitatively reproduce the observations. Our results suggest that the flexibility of DNA is well described by a worm-like chain model, at least for short DNA molecules."}
{"text":"\nWe develop a kinetic theory of two-dimensional point vortices from a BBGKY-like hierarchy. The theory is motivated by a desire to understand the role of vortices in active fluids, such as in the atmosphere or in the solar corona, where they can be highly dynamic, evolving in number, size, and shape, sometimes accelerating, sometimes braking, and sometimes even disappearing. We consider a generalization of the Boltzmann-Gibbs-Gamm-Kergusell-Postal (BGGP) hierarchy to include an additional parameter that controls the braking of vortices. This new parameter enters the kinetic energy, the generalized mean velocity, and the distribution function in a way that allows for a continuous variation of the vortex kinetic energy between its minimum (associated with vortex braking) and its maximum (associated with vortex accretion). We solve the resulting kinetic equations and find that, for large values of the braking parameter, the vortices are dynamically stable and can be further divided into weakly interacting small vortices and strongly interacting large vortices. We also find that, when the vortices are very small, the theory reduces to the usual kinetic theory of point vortices, known from the literature. We discuss the physical implications of our findings."}
{"text":"\n\nWe study the equilibrium and stability of magnetohydrostatic solar prominences in near-potential coronal magnetic fields. The equilibrium shape and stability of such a prominence are affected by the non-axisymmetric coronal magnetic field, which is due to the optimization of energy stored in the magnetic field as function of the Lorentz force. We derive a simple expression for the resulting equilibrium height of a prominence as function of the ratio between the prominence width and the inverse of the square of the magnetic field strength in the corona. We show that the height of a magnetohydrostatic prominence in a near-potential magnetic field is proportionally larger for a larger width-to-field strength ratio. In other words, the equilibrium height of a prominence in a near-potential magnetic field increases faster with the width of the prominence than for a uniform field. The derived expression for the equilibrium height can be used to derive a stability criterion for such a prominence in terms of the same width-to-field strength ratio. We show that a prominence is stable if the width-to-field strength ratio is smaller than a critical value, which is depending only on the strength of the magnetic field in the corona. We discuss our results in the framework of a simple model of a solar prominence in a near-potential magnetic field, which we develop further in order to study the stability of a prominence in the presence of a shear flow in the corona."}
{"text":"\n\nWe have developed a new experimental approach, which we dub scanning electromechanical nanoscopy (SEMNS), for local electromechanical probing of cells and biomolecules in a liquid environment. The approach is based on scanning probe microscopy and involves a gentle cell landing scheme that uses liquid as the coupling agent between the cell membrane and the tip of a scanning probe microscope. We demonstrate that this coupling scheme enables intracellular measurement of both passive and active mechanical properties of cell plasma membranes. We also show that, when combined with laser spectroscopy, SEMNS can be used to map the spatial variation of lipid ordering, thus providing new insights into the relationship between membrane structure and mechanical properties. We believe that this new approach will open up a range of new possibilities for characterizing cellular and biomolecular systems at the nanoscale in a liquid environment, with potential applications in biology, chemistry, and materials science."}
{"text":"\n\nWe are motivated by the problem of the search for new organic materials for optical applications. We have developed a new approach to the search for such materials based on the analysis of the optical transitions in the electronic absorption spectra. Our approach is based on the construction of the matrix spectrum and the analysis of its properties. The basic idea is to construct a matrix whose elements are the numbers of transitions in the corresponding electronic absorption bands. We have considered such important properties of the matrix as its symmetry, the distribution of elements, and the correlation functions. We have developed a numerical method for the reduction of the matrix to a diagonal form. This method allows us to identify the important properties of the matrix, which in turn can be used for the selection of the most promising materials for optical applications. We have applied our method to the analysis of the optical transitions in organic materials. We have considered the monomer and polymer materials based on thienylbenzo[1,2-b;4,5-b']dithiophene (BDTT). We have found that the matrixes of the optical transitions in these materials have very simple structures, which in turn can be used for the selection of the most promising materials for optical applications."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate the diversity of MIMO multihop relay channels. We consider the amplify-and-forward relay channel where a source wants to communicate with a destination via a relay. We allow the source to send independent messages to the relay and the destination in each time slot. We also allow the relay to use both its antennas to forward the message to the destination, after having received it on one of its antennas. We study the performance of this channel in terms of the outage probability and the rate region. We compare the diversity order of the channel with that of other channels. We show that the diversity order of the relay channel is strictly increasing in the number of relay antennas and that it equals the diversity order of the direct channel if the relay uses its second antenna only to obtain a better estimate of the source message. We also derive a general expression of the diversity order for the relay channel, which is shown to have a simple closed form in the case of practical interest."}
{"text":"\nA study of uranium-based multilayers: II. Magnetic properties.\n\nWe have previously reported the observation of a giant magnetoresistance effect in a heterostructure consisting of a magnetic multilayer (Co\/U\/Co) inserted between two nonmagnetic ones (Cu\/U\/Cu) in which the U layer is the spacer between the magnetic and the nonmagnetic layers. We have also found the paradoxical behavior of the nonmagnetic U layer in the nonhysteretic regime, which behaves like a ferromagnet in the hysteretic regime. In this paper, we report the investigation of the role of the thickness of the U layer in this system. We have found that the dependence of the magnetoresistance on the thickness of the U layer is very similar to the one on the Co thickness, while the dependence on the Cu thickness is very small. From this result, we have concluded that the nonmagnetic U layer in this system has a very similar behavior to the magnetic Co layer, while the nonmagnetic Cu layer has almost no role in the giant magnetoresistance effect."}
{"text":"\nThe Magnetic Sensitivity of the Ba II D1 and D2 Lines of the Fraunhofer Spectrum\n\nWe have investigated the magnetic sensitivity of the Ba II D1 and D2 lines in the Fraunhofer spectrum of a totally absorbing barium vapor lamp. The ratio of the intensities of the D1 and D2 lines in the Fraunhofer spectrum is found to be proportional to the magnetic field along the line of sight. We have determined the coefficient of proportionality to be 1.213 (2), which agrees with the value given by est Divinity. Our result is in qualitative agreement with the results of a previous investigation, in which the author had found the ratio to be proportional to the magnetic field, but the coefficient of proportionality found by us differs from that given in the earlier investigation. We have also investigated the effect of the total pressure of the barium vapor on the magnetic sensitivity of the Ba II D1 and D2 lines in the Fraunhofer spectrum. The ratio of the intensities of the D1 and D2 lines in the Fraunhofer spectrum is found to be independent of the total pressure of the barium vapor."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider the asymptotic behavior of solutions to the heat equation with a nonlinear boundary condition, as the initial data tends to a Dirichlet boundary condition. We show that, in a natural class of examples, the solutions tend to a solution of the Dirichlet sigma model with a nonlinear boundary condition. The main tool is the version of theNash-Moser theorem for a Dirichlet boundary condition. The analysis also provides a motivation for the study of a class of partial differential equations which includes the heat equation with a nonlinear boundary condition, the Navier-Stokes equation with a nonlinear boundary condition and the Euler equations with a transversally varying boundary condition. It also suggests an approach to the study of the limiting behavior of solutions to these equations as the initial data tends to a Dirichlet boundary condition.\n\nThe results in this paper are based on the work of the author and M.

{"text":"\nParametric nonholonomic frame transforms and exact solutions in gravity\n\nWe consider a class of exact solutions of the Einstein equations of motion in a curved background spacetime, in the form of a parametric nonholonomic frame transform. The main examples of this type of solution are the Landau, Kerr and Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m metrics, which describe a uniform spinning disk, a spinning black hole, and a spherically symmetric object with a big bang type expansion, respectively. In the case of a spinning object the nonholonomicity is related to the geometric structure of the space-time. We show that in the case of a Kerr or Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m metric the nonholonomicity is of a purely dynamical origin, and is related to the Killing generator of the symmetry group of the background space-time. As an application, we consider the simplest case of a scalar particle moving on a Kerr background. We show that the corresponding motion is a completely symmetric and coordinate independent solution, which describes a uniformly accelerated particle with a relativistic velocity increase. We also show that this solution has a simple geometric structure, and discuss a possible physical interpretation."}
{"text":"\nWe present WMAP observations of the foreground polarization of the CMB. We find that the polarized foreground emission is nearly planar, with a temperature of about 10 K, and a magnitude-squared bias of about 2%. The effective beam weighing technique we employ reduces the noise in the measurement by a factor of three compared to the naive approach. We show that the polarization of the foreground emission is inversely correlated with the star formation rate of the galaxy cluster it is coming from. This correlation is not quite as tight as we expected based on earlier studies of the correlation of the total foreground emission with star formation rate, but is still statistically significant at the 5% level. We show that the correlation is best described by a power law with a correlation length of 3 Mpc\/hMpc. We discuss possible physical explanations for the correlation, and conclude that a model in which the correlation is due to thermal chaos breaking up large-scale structure, in a manner similar to the way that eddies in a fluid break up large-scale flow, is the most plausible. We estimate that the uncertainty in the foreground polarization measurement is less than 2%."}

{"text":"\n\nInterstellar ices are complex aggregates of numerous species, and the understanding of their formation and evolution is essential to comprehend the chemical evolution of the interstellar medium. HCOOH is a representative of highly-ionized species that are able to form large ice clumps by freezing out of the gas phase. In this work, we investigate HCOOH in ice analogues, based on a pure HCOOH ice sample that was previously synthesized in the laboratory. We find that the band shapes of HCOOH in ices are different from those in the gas phase. In particular, the feature at 6285 cm\u22121 is significantly narrower in ices than in the gas phase. This finding suggests that HCOOH is highly hydrogen-bonded in the ices, and its concentration is not uniform throughout the ice but instead is associated with regions of high density. In addition, we find that the concentrations of HCOOH in ices are dependent on the type of ice. In particular, HCOOH is more concentrated in amorphous ice than in crystalline ice. These results are consistent with the idea that HCOOH molecules are embedded in the ice matrix, and their concentrations are related to the local ice density."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present phase-resolved transit photometry and transit spectroscopy of the hot Jupiter XO-2b as observed with the Hubble Space Telescope. We determine the orbital elements of the inner binary, finding a period of 87.5 \u00b1 0.3 min and a roughly equal-mass, low-inclination configuration. We measure the radius of XO-2b to be 1.325 RJ (1.013 R\u2299), which is larger than predicted by most prior estimates. We find the metallicity of XO-2b to be [Fe\/H] = +0.10 \u00b1 0.09, which is significantly higher than the typical value for giant planets of [Fe\/H] \u223c +0.01. The photometric phase curve is well described by a model in which the semi-major axis of the orbit is a linear function of phase. We fit the transit data with a model in which the metal-rich atmosphere produces a large pressure-induced recession of the effective stellar gravity from the visible disk, resulting in a very low limb-darkening slope and a nearly linear radial profile. The resulting regression gives a bulk density of \u03c1 = 0.71 \u00b1 0.06 \u03c1\u2299. This is only slightly higher than the value derived from a simple model in which the planet is treated as a uniform density sphere, \u03c1 = 0.66 \u03c1\u2299, but much lower than the value derived from a model in which the atmosphere has the same metallicity as the host star, \u03c1 = 1.31 \u03c1\u2299.

{"text":"\nWe present XMM-Newton observations of the first unidentified TeV gamma-ray source, TeV J2032+4130. We find that the X-ray and gamma-ray emission is due to a single entity. The X-ray spectrum is described by a power law with a photon index of 1.9 and a temperature of 3 kT. The intensity is modulated with a source count rate of $6 \\times 10^{-4}$ s$^{-1}$ and a morphology consistent with a single source. The Compton-thinning ratio is 1.5, indicating that the bulk of the gamma-ray emission is likely to be due to thermal Compton-scattering of the X-ray radiation. A 1-10 keV peak luminosity of $3 \\times 10^{36}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and a duty cycle of $25 \\%$ suggest a highly variable and transient source. The observed properties of the source are consistent with a single Wolf-Rayet star with a strong magnetic field and a non-spherically symmetric distribution of matter. We discuss the properties of the source in the context of known Wolf-Rayet stars and the phenomena that may produce the observed X-ray and gamma-ray emission."}
{"text":"\n\nCritical phenomena in complex networks\n\nWe investigate the onset of critical phenomena in complex networks, as captured by the concept of criticality. We focus on three different concepts of criticality, namely critical activity, criticality and critical network structure, and their relationships. We find that the three concepts are highly correlated, but that each captures a different aspect of the same phenomenon. We use a combination of analytical and numerical methods, supported by a rigorous theoretical framework, to gain a detailed understanding of the critical phenomena in complex networks. In particular, we find that the most critical regions in complex networks are characterized by a strong correlation between the three different concepts of criticality. We also find that the criticality of a complex network is in general higher than that of its individual components, which is a generic property of complex systems that we term as criticality Bonus. Our analytical results are confirmed by numerical simulations, and we also derive a simple algorithm to identify the most critical regions in a complex network. Our findings are relevant for understanding the criticality of large-scale systems, such as financial markets, the climate, or the brain, and have practical applications in finding the most effective way to perturb a complex network to induce a critical response."}
{"text":"\nWe propose a covariant holographic entanglement entropy proposal for a general framework of holography with one space-like dimension and one time-like dimension, which are the prerequisites to achieve the notion of the contingency of quantum theory and the Gibson-Ma particle-like nature of quantum information.

The proposed general framework of holography also provides a solution to the non-well-posed problem of how to create an exact replica of a quantum state by entanglement, without the need to consider a particular basis of the quantum state. We show that the proposed framework of holography is consistent with the general framework of de Broglie-Bohm theory. We also show that it predicts the possibility of faster-than-light communication and the possibility of using entanglement to create an exact replica of a quantum state."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate conservation laws in metric theories with nonlinear perturbations on curved backgrounds. We consider a large class of such theories which includes general relativity, Carterian gravity, Einstein- Maxwell theory and Newtonian theory as special cases. The theories are described by a metric tensor $g$ and a symmetric conservation tensor $T^{\\mu\\nu}$, with $\\mu$ and $\\nu$ being spacetime indices. The metric tensor is allowed to have a nonlinear structure and can be written in a background curved in a Riemannian or Finsler space. The symmetric conservation tensor has a conventional linear structure and is constructed from a tracefree tensorial decomposition of the metric tensor. In this way, we show that the conventional structure of the conservation tensor is invariant under an arbitrary nonlinear perturbation of the metric tensor in a background curved in a Riemannian or Finsler space. As a by-product, we show that the usual tracefree tensorial decomposition of the metric tensor is invariant under an arbitrary nonlinear perturbation in a background curved in a Riemannian or Finsler space. This holds true also for a tracefree tensorial decomposition of a nonlinear conservation tensor in a background curved in a Riemannian or Finsler space. We show further that an arbitrary nonlinear perturbation of the conservation tensor is invariant under a background change from a Riemannian to a Finsler space and vice versa. In our final section we discuss the general meaning of these results for an arbitrary symmetric tensor and an arbitrary metric tensor on a Riemannian or Finsler space."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a new method for inferring the mass function of active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the local universe. We have derived a statistical scheme that allows us to distinguish between the contribution to the mass function of galaxies and that of the central AGN. Our method does not require any assumption about the functional form of the mass function and can be used to test the tightness of the relationship between the two components. We find that the mass function of the local galaxies is well described by a power law with a linear index of \u03b3 = 1.35 \u00b1 0.09, independently of the considered galaxy group or cluster. The contribution of the central AGN to the total mass function is always less tight, with a average index of \u03b3 = 1.42 \u00b1 0.1. The difference between the two components is highly significant (\u2a7e5\u03c3) whenever the mass function of the central AGN is above 10% of the total. We have also derived the first empirical evidence that the tightest possible mass function compatible with the data is a power law with an index of \u03b3 = 1.38 \u00b1 0.1. This finding suggests that the simplest form of the correspondence principle is valid, according to which the mass function of the sum of a large number of galaxies is equal to the sum of the mass functions of the galaxies, with the galaxies being located at the same positions. Our method can be used to test other hypothesis about the mass function of active galaxies."}
{"text":"\n\nWe construct a family of BPS type IIB interfaces that generalize the construction of junction conditions at BPS type IIA interfaces. These are local solutions of the BPS type IIB equation of motion that are in general exactly half-BPS, and thus may be regarded as Janus solutions in the sense of Bergh and STagg. The construction is motivated by the desire to have a simple model of a BPS interface that is always half-BPS, even when the total BPS charge is odd. This is in contrast to the standard BPS type IIA junction conditions, which are not half-BPS when the total BPS charge is odd. The family of BPS type IIB interfaces we construct has as its limiting case the BPS type IIA junction conditions, and in particular is related to the construction of junction conditions via BPS type IIA pity LPs. We consider the simplest case of a family of BPS type IIB interfaces that is symmetric under the exchange of the ghost and anti-ghost variables. This is the case in which the BPS type IIB interfaces have the structure of BPS type IIA interfaces with an extra term that is the square of the ghost field. We show that such BPS type IIB interfaces can be obtained as the limit of a family of supersymmetric Janus solutions of the BPS type IIB equation of motion, and compute their singularities. We show that the singularities have the structure of anti-self-duality.

{"text":"\n\nAbstract for work with title: Exact half-BPS Type IIB interface solutions II: Flux solutions and multi-Janus.\nWe consider the problem of constructing an interface between two half-BPS (Berezinskii-Babuska-Uhlenbecki) type IIB stringy vacua with non-empty interstices. We show that in the limit of large flux the interface can be constructed from a single, arbitrarily thick flux shell, provided the bulk theories share a common Janus function. We term such an interface solution multi-Janus. For the special case of a pure N=1 SUSY algebra we show that the multi-Janus solution is unique. We derive an equation for the bulk superpotential which must be satisfied by any multi-Janus solution, and use it to prove that the solution is stable with respect to small perturbations. This equation provides a check-list for possible multi-Janus solutions. For a class of flux solutions which contain a radial flux we show that the multi-Janus solution can be constructed by placing one of the bulk theories in the interior of the flux shell and the other on its exterior. We discuss a number of examples of multi-Janus solutions, and consider their implications for bulk theory."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider the problem of the origin of high-energy cosmic rays and neutrinos in the framework of thefishbone mechanism. According to this scenario, the high-energy particles are producedby the semi-relativistic jet that is formed during the collapse of a massive star. It is shownthat the relative strength of the high-energy neutrino flux as compared to the flux of high-energycosmic rays is related to the relative content of the exotic hadron-like particles (like omega,sigma, and gluinos) in the final hadron shower. This, in its turn, depends on the initialmagnetic field configuration in the star and the jet. We analyze the three simplest cases ofthe magnetic field configuration in the jet and show that in all these cases the relative content ofthe exotic hadron-like particles in the final shower is small, which explains the relative weaknessof the neutrino flux as compared to the cosmic ray flux observed on Earth. We also discuss thepossible mechanisms of the particle energy distribution in the jet, and show that the only themethat can explain the observed energy distribution of the particles in the jet is the exponentialenergy distribution function with the index of 1.8. This result was obtained by us earlier for thecosmological sources of the high-energy cosmic rays and neutrinos. We also analyze theproportions of the different hadron-like particles in the jet, and show that in all cases themajority of the hadron-like particles in the jet are the light ones, like protons and alphas. Theonly exception is the case with the magnetic field parallel to the jet, when the heavy hadron-like particles (with the mass number A > 2) can be dominant.

{"text":"\nWe present a model of the evolution of a trans-relativistic supernova (TRSN) and its effects on the surrounding medium. Our goal is to understand the nature of the cosmic rays (CRs) produced in such explosions and their contribution to the galactic CRs. We solve the relevant equations for a spherically symmetric TRSN and account for the effects of the explosion on the surrounding medium. Our main result is that a TRSN can produce a burst of CRs with energy comparable to that of the entire galactic CRs, but only during the first $\\sim 10^5$ years after the explosion. After this initial burst, the CRs produced by the TRSN drop rapidly and eventually reach the same level as the background CRs. We also show that the energy distribution of the CRs produced by the TRSN depends sensitively on the details of the explosion, in particular on the chemical composition of the stellar envelope. Our results suggest that a TRSN has the potential to explain a number of observed phenomena, including the phenomenon of Terrestrial Crests, the radiation belts, and possibly also the origin of the galactic CRs."}
{"text":"\n\nWe investigate the structure and evolution of horizon-penetrating accretion disks around rotating black holes in full general relativity, in the presence of a cosmological constant and taking into account the rest-mass density and the bulk viscosity of the disk. We show that these disks can be stable against gravitational collapse, despite their extremely low effective viscosity, if their density distribution is properly designed. We also show that the inclusion of the bulk viscosity in the energy balance is crucial to prevent the onset of dangerous thermo-mechanical instabilities, like the Rayleigh-Taylor and the Birch-Murnaghan instabilities, which could lead to the prompt collapse of the disk. In our analysis, the key physical quantity is the difference between the imaginary parts of the principal geodesic Killing vectors of the black hole and the disk, which we denote as the \"cosmological subsidization\" of the disk. We evaluate this subsidization for a wide range of disk densities and find that it is large enough to prevent the instant collapse of the disk in most realistic cases. However, we also show that, when this subsidization is not large enough to cancel the bulk viscosity, dangerous thermo-mechanical instabilities may occur. We analyze the physical origin of these instabilities and evaluate the critical bulk viscosity and density ratio that stabilized disks must satisfy in order to avoid them. We also derive a simple expression for the evolution of the ratio of the radial extension of the disk to its thickness, which is shown to be in good agreement with numerical solutions in certain ranges of parameters."}
{"text":"\n\nWe have developed a method of measuring the structure function coefficient C' in quasielastic electron scattering from nuclei, which is not sensitive to the interference from the incident electron wave. The method is based on the idea that the mean number of scattered electrons per nucleus, <n>, is related to C' by the relation <n>=1\/[2(C'')^2-1] and that this relation is nearly valid for all nuclei in a certain range of atomic numbers. The range of validity of the relation was found by a study of the statistical variation of the number of scattered electrons per nucleus, <n>, as a function of the atomic number of the target nuclei. The precision of the method was found to be about 1% for nuclei with Z=1-100. We applied the method to the measurement of C' for some nuclei with Z=2-100, and found that the C' values are in good agreement with the theoretical predictions of the single-nucleus exact-response theory, which was also used to evaluate C' from the measured scattering cross sections."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present high-resolution (\u03bb\/D \u223c 100\u20131000) radio images of the superbubble surrounding the supernova (SN) 1987A. These images show the superbubble in great detail, including many features that were not previously visible at lower resolutions. The superbubble is asymmetric, with a large-scale lobe extending east-northeastward for \u223c 70 pc and a second, smaller-scale lobe extending north-northwestward for \u223c 35 pc. A number of small-scale structures are visible within the superbubble, including a prominent north-south-oriented chain of 3\u20134 arcminute-scale knots. We have found three new jets, bringing the total number of jets in the superbubble to nine. The sources of these jets are not the surviving companion star but instead are likely to be either accretion shock regions or the outer surface of the remnant stellar core. Two of the new jets are north-south-oriented and are collimated along magnetic field lines. The third jet is unique in that it is not collimated but instead is a bipolar flow with a complex structure. We have identified three regions of possible X-ray emission within the superbubble, although none of these regions is spatially coincident with the radio sources. The most likely explanation for the X-ray emission is the interaction of the superbubble with the ambient interstellar medium. We have derived a total mass for the superbubble of \u223c 5  \u00d7 10 36 grams, \u223c 1.4 times the mass of the Sun. This is the most accurate mass estimate to date. The mass is comprised of a inner-bubble region with a higher density and a much lower total mass than the outer superbubble region. We discuss several mechanisms that may have driven the evolution of the superbubble and estimate the rate of mass loss from the superbubble. We find that the mass loss is likely to have been dominated by two-body interactions and that the rate of mass loss has decreased considerably over the past 15 years."}
{"text":"\n\nWe investigate exact Floquet states of a driven condensate and their stabilities. Let a system of identically prepared quasiparticles interact with a time-periodic driving. The stability of an exact Floquet state, which is a special eigenstate of the mean dynamic operator, is found to be strictly dependent on the drive strength, but weakly dependent on the initial condition. For a drive with a finite amplitude, a unique Floquet state is selected and remains stable against all small perturbations. For a drive with an amplitude close to zero, the system may be in a meta-stable state with several close Floquet states, and small perturbations can drive the system between these states. We discuss a physical example of such a meta-stable state, the so-called zero-temperature equilibrium state. Our results are derived from a rigorous theoretical analysis of the relaxation process of the condensate after a sudden drive-induced perturbation. The stability properties of exact Floquet states can be used to design optimal protocols for reaching a target state by a controlled drive."}
{"text":"\n\nWe have developed a sensitive method for the measurement of ultra-low potassium contaminations with accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) by using a cryogenic silver ionization source. The motivation for this work is to improve the detection limit in order to measure the natural abundance of potassium in certified reference materials (CRMs) and samples for ultra-low potassium analysis. The key ideas and methodology are as follows. The optimization of the silver source temperature and the irradiation time was performed to maximize the number of silver ions generated. The measurements were carried out in the collision mode with a 1.5-MeV proton beam, and the ion beam was measured with a multi-channel plate detector. The obtained results were compared with those of the non-collision mode, and the optimum measurement conditions were found to be in the collision mode with the silver source temperature of 100 \u00b0C and the irradiation time of 30 min. Under these conditions, the detection limit was improved by a factor of about 3 compared with the non-collision mode. The problem this work attempts to solve is to improve the detection limit in order to measure the natural abundance of potassium in CRMs and samples for ultra-low potassium analysis with AMS. The practical application of this work is that the developed method enables us to measure the natural abundance of potassium in CRMs and samples for ultra-low potassium analysis with a high degree of reliability. The theoretical application of this work is that the developed method will contribute to the further development of the AMS method for the measurement of ultra-low potassium contaminations."}

{"text":"\n\nWe present a simple model of the evolution of the hot intergalactic medium (HIM) based on the idea that the large-scale structure of the universe is mostly made up of dark matter and that the distribution of galaxies is described by the criterion that galaxies must lie at the peaks of the density distribution. The model can naturally explain the phenomenon of galaxy clusters and super clusters as well as the large-scale structure of the hot intergalactic medium. In this model the hot intergalactic medium evolves in a manner similar to the evolution of the cosmic microwave background, with the difference that the fluctuations in the case of the HIM are excited by the local growth of structure and the large scale structure is generated by the gentle smoothing due to the expansion of the universe. We show that the hot intergalactic medium has a power law spectrum with a index of 1.5  1.6 and that the temperature of the hot intergalactic medium is in a good agreement with the one measured by the COBE\/FIRAS instrument."}
{"text":"\nWe present phase-resolved spectroscopy and photometry of the optical counterpart of the TeV \u03b3-ray source HESS J1813-178.

We find that the optical counterpart of HESS J1813-178 is likely to be a member of the cluster of young stars and gas clouds surrounding the massive binary star system HD 269700. We discovered a very low-mass member (M \u223c 0.17 M\u2299) of the 55-M\u2299 cluster, which is likely to be a protoplanetary object. The low-mass member is moving with a velocity of \u223c 60 km s\u207b\u00b9 relative to the cluster, and it will probably be dynamically ejected from the cluster in the future. We also found a 12.8-h duration cycle in the optical photometry of HESS J1813-178, which might be related to the orbital period of a massive binary star system. A 1.3-h duration anomaly was also found in the data, but we have no explanation for it at this time. We discuss a model in which a low-mass member of the 55-M\u2299 cluster is detected with a radio telescope, and the detected radio source is the wind nebula around a massive binary star system. According to this model, the TeV \u03b3-ray source HESS J1813-178, the low-mass member, and the massive binary star system are physically associated with each other."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present the results of an imaging survey for extrasolar planets around 45 close, young stars. The survey was conducted with the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory's 1.5 m telescope at the Fred L. esteem Observatory and with the 10 m Gran Telescopio Canarias on the island of La Palma, using theStraus absorption and emission filters. We obtained precise photometry for each star to distinguish between planets and false alarms due to blending and to determine the planetary radii. We find that the photometric method alone is not sufficient to yield reliable detection of close-in giant planets, due to the large variation in image quality and seeing conditions. We present data for 24 stars in common with the MACHO survey and 9 additional stars. For each star we determine the equivalent depth of the detected planet, which we use to derive the orbital radius and compare to the radii derived from the astrometry. We find that the radii derived from the two methods agree within the precision of the data, indicating that our measurements are not affected by significant blends or clouds. We find no evidence of a trend in planetary radii as a function of spectral type, distance from the star, or host-star mass. We detect a single planetary candidate that has a radius between 1.6 and 2.1 RJ (2\u03c3 confidence interval), corresponding to a true planetary radius of 1.9 RJ. This planet is detected in 9 images taken with the Straus filter at the VLT and 3 images taken with the SDIS at the MMT, indicating that it has a relatively large radius and is probably a giant planet."}
{"text":"\nWe have developed a new method, based on the historical development of the concepts of electrical capacity and resistance, for testing whether the advanced potentials of advocates of electrical therapy are anomalous. Our test consists of determining the equivalent resistance and capacity of a specimen of each type of advanced potential and then subjecting these to the standard capacitor-resistor combination, which is a sensitive detector of anomalous resistivity. We found that the resistivity of the advanced potentials was generally several orders of magnitude higher than the resistivity of the controls, which consisted of specimens of similar materials that had been prepared and tested in the same way. We also found that the resistivity of some specimens was very low, even lower than the resistivity of the controls. These latter specimens were found to be superconducting at low temperatures. We were able to demonstrate a sharp transition temperature, below which the resistivity fell off quickly, and above which it rose steeply. We conclude that the resistivity of advanced potentials is anomalous and that the advocates of electrical therapy are correct in this respect."}

{"text":"\nWe consider the problem of shear-rate dependent transport coefficients for inelastic Maxwell models in simple shear. The constitutive relation is general enough to account for various kinds of inelastic behaviour, such as perfect or imperfect N decreases, and is applicable to both steady-state and transient responses. The analysis is based on a straightforward application of the constitutive relation to the transport coefficients, and is valid for both Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids. The main practical application of this work is in the area of effective medium theory, which is the basis of most calculations of multiphase blends. We consider the simplest case of a Maxwell model with a distribution of relaxations, and obtain simple expressions for the shear-rate dependent viscosity and other transport coefficients in terms of the model parameters and the shear rate. The parameters are related by a simple dispersion equation. The predictions of the model are compared with experimental data for several systems, and good agreement is obtained in several cases."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present here a comprehensive statistical study of the 3-D structure of quiet Sun magnetic fields from space-borne observations. We focus on the horizontal and vertical correlation lengths and the field strength distribution in different layers. The analysis is based on a large set of Heliospheric Imagers observations from the Solar Optical Telescope on board the Hinode spacecraft. We find that the correlation length in the horizontal direction depends on the solar activity, increasing during quiescent and declining during active periods. A similar, but opposite, behaviour is found for the correlation length in the vertical direction. Furthermore, we find that the field strength distribution in the photosphere is well described by a power law with a positive power law index, whereas a negative power law index describes the field strength distribution in the upper photosphere and the chromosphere. We discuss our results in the framework of a simple model in which the quiet Sun magnetic field is described by the sum of a small-scale structure and a large-scale structure. Our results suggest that the large-scale structure may be responsible for the correlation lengths in the horizontal and vertical directions, while the small-scale structure is responsible for the power law field strength distribution."}
{"text":"\nRelaxation dynamics in fluids of platelike colloidal particles. We consider statistical mechanical models of fluids composed of hard platelike particles which interact via a short range repulsion and show a strong tendency to form ordered structures. We find a rich variety of dynamic behavior, which includes the formation of complex, long-lived vortices and a slow relaxation to a state of uniform density, possibly with a very large number of small-scale vortices. We discuss the role of the lateral interactions in these dynamics, and show that a simple consideration of the affinities and exclusions in the system is not sufficient to explain the rich variety of dynamic behavior observed. We also consider a model in which the platelike particles are allowed to rotate, and show that the inclusion of this degree of freedom has a major effect on the relaxation dynamics. Our results suggest that the interplay between the lateral interactions and the rotational degrees of freedom may be important in determining the dynamic behavior of real fluids composed of platelike particles, such as some polymers and colloidal particles."}
{"text":"\nWe present a detailed study of the oscillations of sterile neutrinos in the MiniBooNE detector. We use a recently proposed method that relies on the identification of events with a large number of hadronic jets and we find that the oscillations of the sterile neutrinos can be extracted with a high statistical significance, even in the absence of a fully calibrated detector. We show that the simplest model, in which the sterile neutrinos are produced with a uniform distribution in the neutrino beam, is strongly disfavored by our data, which implies that the distribution of the sterile neutrinos in the beam must be non-uniform. We also show that the currently proposed mechanism for the production of the sterile neutrinos is unable to produce a non-uniform distribution with the characteristics observed in MiniBooNE. We discuss a possible physical mechanism that might explain the observed distribution, and point out that the confirmation or refutation of this mechanism would require a much larger neutrino detector, which would also be able to resolve the small-angle regime where the distribution of the sterile neutrinos is likely to be more informative."}

{"text":"\n\nWe present the results of a systematic, all-sky, photometric survey for objects in the Galactic Center. We targeted stars in the regions of the Galactic Center, the Galactic disk, and the Galactic bulge, using as our basic criterion stars that are brighter than V=18.5 mag. We obtained a good representation of stars in these regions, although there are still some gaps, especially in the direction of the Galactic plane. Our final catalog contains 762, 1931, and 169 stars in the Galactic Center, disk, and bulge, respectively, with measured proper motions and, in most cases, parallactic sky coordinates. We find that the Galactic Center is populated by young, massive stars, with a distinct population of 942 stars with a mean age of about 2 Gyr and a mean mass of about 2 solar masses. A smaller, but still significant, subpopulation of ESLT stars (32 stars with a mean age of about 1.3 Gyr and a mean mass of about 1.3 solar masses) is present as well. There are also 72 stars that do not fit either of these categories, but are probably still members of the Galactic Center, and a further 27 that may be members but require further study. Finally, we discuss the distribution of massive stars in the Galactic Center and the origin of the different populations."}

{"text":"\n\nWe consider effective inverse spectral problems for rational Lax matrices. Such problems were introduced by Donath and Falkirk to study the structure of the solution space of certain partial differential equations. We show that the effective inverse spectral problem is very sensitive to the particular boundary conditions imposed on the rational Lax matrix. In particular, we show that the effective inverse spectral problem is ill-posed for general rational Lax matrices, but is well-posed for certain classes of rational Lax matrices, such as the Somepin- scraps or the voter- scraps. We also show that the effective inverse spectral problem for a rational Lax matrix is equivalent to the solution of a certain Fredholm integral equation of the first kind. We apply our results to prove that certain classes of rational Lax matrices have an effective inverse which is bounded in a neighborhood of the identity matrix.

{"text":"\nWe present a detailed investigation of radiative transfer in SPH simulations of star formation. We have developed a method that allows us to solve the radiative transfer equation in a statistically accurate manner for a large number of particles. Our method is based on the solution of the stationary equilibrium problem. We evaluate the solution at the positions of the particles and project it onto the incident radiation field. The solution of the radiative transfer equation is obtained by solving the associated Helmholtz equation on a regular grid in the background medium. We show that the solution is independent of the grid resolution, provided that the grid is sufficiently fine. Our method is therefore both accurate and efficient. We use our method to study the impact of radiative transfer on the energy balance of a SPH simulation of star formation. We find that radiative cooling of the gas is generally too efficient and that a correct simulation of the energy balance requires a non-grey treatment of the radiative transfer, in which the temperature-dependent emissivity is taken into account. We also find that the standard assumption of a constant emissivity is not valid for gas at high temperatures, and that a significant source of cooling in our model is the efficient re-radiation of the gas in the outer parts of the star-forming region. We discuss our results in the framework of the simple assumption of a grey atmosphere with a constant emissivity, and show that this assumption is likely to be valid only in the inner parts of the star-forming region."}
{"text":"\nWe present a relativistic theory for the angular distribution of the two-photon ionization of hydrogen-like ions in a uniform magnetic field. The theoretical predictions are in good agreement with available experimental data. The main feature of the theory is that it describes the two-photon process as a coherent superposition of virtual single-photon processes, each corresponding to a particular angular momentum. The theory is based on a master-equation approach to the description of the statistical evolution of the coherent superposition. We show that the virtual single-photon processes are equally weighted among all the angular momenta allowed by the conservation of the total angular momentum. The statistical evolution of the coherent superposition is driven by the differential probability of the virtual single-photon processes. We also show that the main contribution to the total angular momentum is given by the s-wave process with the magnetic angular momentum aligned with the ion's angular momentum."}
{"text":"\nWe present a modest proposal for the astronomical community. Our motivation is the increasing burden on professional astronomers to secure funding for their research. We argue that the cost of funding astronomical research is high, while the return on investment is low. We show that the number of professional astronomers has grown dramatically over the past century, despite a comparatively small number of discoveries of fundamental importance. We suggest that, given the current state of affairs, professional astronomical research is an inefficient use of resources, and we propose that these resources be reallocated to increase the number of undergraduate students who receive degrees in astronomy. We demonstrate that a modest investment in this proposal would lead to a substantial increase in the number of amateur astronomers. We argue that, given the vastness of the universe and the limitations of human sensory perception, the amateur astronomer has a better chance of making a discovery of fundamental importance than a professional astronomer does. We conclude that the future of astronomical research lies with the amateur astronomer, and we urge professional astronomers to refocus their efforts on educating undergraduate astronomy students."}
{"text":"\n\nPhotolytically generated aerosols in the mesosphere and thermosphere of Titan\nTitan, the largest satellite of Saturn, is unique among the planets and their satellites in having a substantial atmosphere, which is rare in the solar system. It consists mainly of molecular hydrogen and nitrogen, with a mixture of hydrocarbons. It also has a complex aerosol structure, which is still not completely understood. Our knowledge of the aerosol structure and its evolution is important because the aerosols play a crucial role in the energy balance and therefore the climate of Titan. The photoionization of atmospheric molecules is one of the main sources of aerosols. We present here the result of a statistical study of the photochemistry of the atmosphere of Titan, based on a combination of laboratory experiments and computer simulations.\n\nWe have used a combination of experimental laboratory studies and computer simulation to investigate the photochemistry of the atmosphere of Titan. We have focused on the processes that lead to the formation of aerosols and have used a combination of experimental data and computer simulation to determine the rates of the relevant processes and the resulting aerosol concentrations.\n\nWe have found that the photochemistry of the atmosphere of Titan is complex and that there are a number of different chemical pathways that lead to the formation of aerosols. We have also found that the relative importance of the different pathways depends on a number of factors, including the altitude, the solar flux, and the relative abundance of the different chemical species.\n\nOur results suggest that the photochemistry of the atmosphere of Titan is a complex and dynamic process and that the resulting aerosol structure is likely to be highly variable, depending on a number of factors.

{"text":"\n\nMid-infrared laser light nulling experiment using single-mode conductive waveguides\n\nA nulling experiment was performed to investigate the formation of a single-mode conductive waveguide. The experiment was conducted in the mid-infrared spectral region, where a semiconductor laser was butt-coupled to a single-mode optical fiber. A spatial filter was used to obtain a single-mode light input to the fiber. The fiber was made of a Tellurite-based glass and had a circular core of 3 micrometers in diameter. The fiber was drawn with a velocity of 6 m\/s and had a length of 1.4 km. The temperature of the fiber was maintained at 20 degrees Celsius. A total of 11 thermo-mechanical cycles were applied to the fiber. Each cycle consisted of heating the fiber for 1 hour and then cooling it for 1 hour. The output power of the laser was monitored during each cycle. The laser was operated in continuous wave mode. The results showed that the power at the fiber output decreased after each thermo-mechanical cycle. The power was completely nulled after the 11th cycle. The temporal profile of the output power during the nulling process was analyzed. It was found that the power decreased exponentially with time. The relaxation time of the output power was estimated to be 7 minutes."}
{"text":"\nWe present a resolution to the black hole information paradox which is based on a careful examination of the requirements for a locally pathological spacetime and a rigorous formulation of the laws of quantum gravity. Our resolution draws a clear distinction between the ultraviolet and infrared behaviors of a gravitational field, and shows that it is the former - and not the latter - which is anomalous. We show that this anomaly can be remedied by an appropriate renormalization of the ultraviolet gravitational singularity, and that this renormalization does not affect the high-redshift (i.e. infrared) behavior of the theory. The resulting theory is complete in the sense that it does not predict the violation of any physical laws. However, we also show that it necessarily implies the existence of an ultraviolet-sensitive probe which can be used to \"search\" for gravitational singularities. We argue that this probe - which we dub the \"G\\\"odel Probe\" - can be implemented in a variety of ways in a laboratory setting. We also discuss the relationship between this approach and other resolutions to the information paradox which have been proposed in the context of quantum cosmology."}
{"text":"\nWe present an analysis of the shapes of interstellar extinction curves, based on a statistical study of their morphology. We find that the majority of extinction curves are S-shaped, with the strength of the S-increasing with increasing extinction. We show this to be consistent with a model in which the extinction curve is formed by the sum of a constant through-uve contribution plus a positive power-law contribution that increases with increasing extinction. We find that this model can quantitatively reproduce the shapes of extinction curves, both for stars of known spectral type and for those with unknown spectral type. The power law contribution has a scaling exponent that depends only on the extinction and not on the spectral type of the star. We show that this model can be used to derive the exponent of the power law contribution and the through-UV excess for a given extinction curve, and that these quantities are related in a simple way to the underlying physical properties of the absorbing clouds. We find that the shapes of the extinction curves are consistent with the clouds consisting of a large number of small grains that produce the bulk of the extinction in the UV, and a small number of large grains that produce the bulk of the extinction in the IR. We discuss the implications of this finding for theories of cloud structure and for our understanding of the physics and chemistry of the interstellar medium."}
{"text":"\n\nWe have carried out a systematic search for low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) with active accretion from young (T < 5 kyr) stellar populations. We have identified a total of 13 such systems in a half-square degree survey using two ~7 ks\/s X-ray telescopes, Scorpius and IXOC, with a total exposure time of ~73 ks. We present here the discovery of a new LMXB in the constellation of Ara, designated as Scorpius X-1. This system contains a hard X-ray transient source in a 16.3 kyr old globular cluster. The source has a peculiar, highly non-thermal X-ray spectrum and a relatively long spin-down period of ~44 min. We estimate the accretion rate to be ~0.1 lunar masses per year. The system is likely to contain a relatively massive neutron star with a low-spin-down rate. We estimate the magnetic moment of the neutron star to be mu(BSM) < 3 x 10^33 G cm^3. Our data set of young LMXBs is used to investigate the relation between the spin-down rate and the magnetic moment of the neutron stars in these systems. We find that the spin-down rate of a young LMXB is inversely correlated with the magnetic moment of its neutron star, providing further evidence that the magnetic moment is correlated with the accretion rate. Our results suggest that low-magnetic moment neutron stars are likely to be found in old LMXBs, while high-magnetic moment stars are found in young systems."}
{"text":"\n\nWe study the statistics of light emission in the fractional quantum Hall effect, for the case of a single impurity atom in the quantum well. We show that the light emission is always non-thermal, with a power-law distribution of the photon energy, and that this can be understood from the correlations between the electron and hole pairs in the impurity atom. We derive a simple analytic expression for the light emission rate, which is valid for arbitrary orbital gradings and for arbitrary concentrations of impurity. For a large number of impurities, the emission is quasistatic, with a shot-noise-like variation of the photon number, but with a distribution of the light energy which is not described by a single-level system. We show that the static emission has a simple analytic expression, which is very similar to the one-impurity case. The results are consistent with the idea that the light is emitted by a virtual impurity, which is not a real impurity atom, but rather a transient excited state in the surrounding semiconductor. We discuss possible physical mechanisms for the non-thermal nature of the light emission."}

We further show that thermal noise can be used as the basis for a computing architecture that is secure, and operates at zero-power. We show that a thermal noise source can be used to drive a watchdog circuit that operates at zero-power, and that such a watchdog circuit can be used to drive a computing element that operates at zero-power.

{"text":"\nWe present a detailed analysis of the cluster count and cosmic shear power spectrum data sets used to measure the dark energy density and the evolution of the dark energy equation of state. We show that both data sets are characterized by large scale correlations that can affect the extracted density and evolution. We decompose the correlation structure in a number of independent components, which we relate to the known large scale structure in the Universe. We show that a correction based on the knowledge of the large scale structure can significantly reduce the systematics in the extracted dark energy density and equation of state. The analysis requires a careful treatment of the full covariance matrix of the data sets. We propose a practical approximation that can be used to analyze the data in a statistically meaningful way. We show that the correction to the extracted density and equation of state is significant for the clusters but is less important for the cosmic shear data.

{"text":"\n\nWe present new constraints on the energy density of dark energy from the cosmic shear power spectrum, based on a joint analysis of the observed galaxy distribution in the IllustrisTNG galaxy hydrodynamical simulation and the Azari-Dylamanova (AD) galaxy redshift survey. We show that the departure from Gaussianity in the power spectrum is small for a wide range of redshift and that the power is relatively flat. We find that the intrinsic alignment of the galaxy distribution has a strong effect on the power spectrum and on the requirements for photometric redshift calibration. If the intrinsic alignment is not accounted for, the dark energy constraints from the cosmic shear power spectrum can be significantly tighter than the actual constraints. We show that the level of non-Gaussianity in the power spectrum depends on the shape of the intrinsic alignment, with a shallower alignment producing a more non-Gaussian power spectrum. We discuss the implications of our results for the analysis of future cosmic shear data, including the use of machine learning methods."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present an analysis of high-resolution microlens models for lenses with two stars. Such binary lenses are important because they can provide a precise measurement of the lens mass, independent of the lens's distance to the observer. We find that the commonly used caustic crossing method is unreliable for low-mass lenses (M > 1.5 planet masses) and lenses with a large baseline (D > 50 AU). We show that the central peak of the light curve is much better for this purpose. The measured mass is in agreement with predictions from theory, except for a slight preference for odd over even masses. This discrepancy is probably due to a non-linear response of the peak to the lens mass. We also derive a simple formula for the relative weight of the central peak in the light curve, which allows to estimate the lens mass for a given lens. This can be useful to screen out unlikely microlens events. Our analysis is based on a fit to high-resolution microlens light curves with two stars, obtained from a large set of event candidates found in the archives of the MicroFUN ( microlens search using the Fritz) survey."}
{"text":"\n\nWe show that an insulating material can be turned into a topological insulator by changing the Chern number at a certain point in the Brillouin zone. We find that the topological properties of the resulting structure are very sensitive to the nature of the U(1) symmetry group which acts on the structure. If this group is the standard lattice translation group, we obtain a unidirectional insulator, while if it is the reciprocal lattice translation group, we get a bidirectional insulator. If the group is not the standard lattice translation group but its discrete symmetry is broken by a certain symmetry operation, we obtain a unidirectional insulator with a topological defect, while if the group is not the reciprocal lattice translation group but its discrete symmetry is broken by a certain symmetry operation, we obtain a bidirectional insulator with a topological defect. We show that the latter two structures are topologically equivalent to each other. As an application, we show that the unidirectional insulator with the topological defect can be used to represent one-dimensional edge states in a topological superconducting material."}
{"text":"\nWe present a new method for observing two-particle Aharonov-Bohm interference, using two electrons with different initial positions and momenta, in the case of a symmetric potential-energy function, V(x). The method is based on the analysis of the behavior of the interference pattern as a function of the initial momenta of the two electrons. Our analysis shows that the visibility of the two-particle interference pattern is always better when the initial momenta are aligned in the same direction (i.e., when the relative momentum is close to zero) than when the initial momenta are anti-aligned. We show that this is a general property of the interference between two independent electrons, and we present a physical derivation of this property based on the explicit solution of the two-particle Schr\u00f6dinger equation. We also present a method for measuring the relative momentum of the two electrons at the moment of their detection, and we show that this measurement has an intrinsic two-particle resolution that is always better than the momentum resolution in a one-particle measurement. The new method for observing two-particle interference has important practical applications in the context of scanning tunneling microscopy, in particular for the study of the quantum transport properties of nanostructures and for the characterization of surface and tip-sample interactions."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present chemical and cooling models for low- to intermediate-mass star formation at very low metallicity. The chemical model includes a detailed treatment of chemical evolution and an empirical treatment of the gravitational settling of molecular clouds. The cooling model includes a chemical and physical treatment of radiative and turbulent cooling, as well as a simple treatment of the cooling flow structure. We find that the minimum metallicity for star formation is about one order of magnitude lower at low densities than at high densities. We show that the minimum metallicity depends only weakly on the initial mass of the molecular cloud, but is strictly dependent on the density. We also show that the low metallicity limit is approached from above, and that a significant fraction of the initial mass of a cloud has to be accreted after the star formation has begun. We discuss our results in the framework of the single-zone and two-zone models, and we derive a simple expression for the minimum metallicity as a function of the cloud density."}

As a result we obtain that any two such normalizers are approximately unitarily equivalent."}
{"text":"\nWe study the effect of temperature-dependent shape anisotropy on the coercivity of a thermally assisted magnetic recording system comprising of a Stoner-Wohlfarth soft ferromagnet (SFM) with anisotropic easy axis, a hard ferromagnet (FM), and a Heisenberg antiferromagnet (AFM) with isotropic easy plane. We find that in the presence of a finite thermal activation energy, a thermally induced lattice distortion in the SFM with anisotropic easy axis can induce a distribution of multiple magnetic domains with different sizes and shapes, which results in a decrease of the coercivity of the SFM. By taking into account the effect of anisotropic shape, our result shows a good agreement with the recent experimental observations in which the coercivity of a thermally assisted magnetic recording system comprising of a Stoner-Wohlfarth soft ferromagnet with anisotropic easy axis, a hard ferromagnet, and a Heisenberg antiferromagnet with isotropic easy plane is found to be decreased with increasing the thermal activation energy."}
{"text":"\n\nWe study the dynamics of a rotating Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) by means of the Cranked Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (C-HFB) approach. The method is based on the solution of the Bogoliubov equations for a single-mode approximation, which is equivalent to the conventional Bogoliubov equation for a BEC, with the difference that the mode basis is now given by the Cranked Hartree-Fock (CHF) basis sets. These basis sets are exact in the sense that they are constructed from the exact Bogoliubov spectrum of the BEC. As a result, the C-HFB approach circumvents the need for the a-priori assumption of a small number of spatial modes, as is necessary in the conventional Bogoliubov approach. We find that the C-HFB approach is accurate for a wide range of angular momenta and in general gives more physical insight into the dynamics of the BEC than the conventional approach. We analyze the dynamics of a BEC on a circular orbit and find that the conventional approach is not able to describe the dynamics in the limit of large angular momentum, where the C-HFB approach still gives a good description of the dynamics. The C-HFB approach is generally applicable to rotating BECs in both axi-symmetric and planar-symmetric traps. \n\nWe also discuss the implementation of the C-HFB approach to rotating BECs with a number of spatial modes that is large but still finite. We show that the C-HFB approach is in this case less accurate than the conventional approach, which is able to give a good description of the dynamics of a finite-mode rotating BEC even in the limit of large angular momentum. We also propose a basis set that combines the conventional Bogoliubov basis sets with the CHF basis sets in a way that allows one to accurately describe the dynamics of a finite-mode rotating BEC for a large range of angular momenta."}
{"text":"\nMotivation\nA large amount of functional proteins with similar amino acid sequences are found in different species, but the neutral theory of molecular evolution does not take into account the evolution of protein function. The extensive availability of complete genome data has made it possible to investigate thoroughly the relationship between neutral evolution and functional evolution.\nResults\nWe show that the rate of evolution of a protein's function is higher when this protein is more conserved on the neutral evolutionary branch. We demonstrate that this finding holds for a large set of proteins of different evolutionary ages, whose functions have been evolving for a large number of generations. We also show that younger proteins evolve their function faster than older proteins. We conclude that neutral evolution aids functional evolution.\nProblem solved\nThe effect of neutral evolution on functional evolution had not been investigated extensively, despite the fact that a large number of proteins with similar amino acid sequences are found in different species. Our work shows that neutral evolution aids functional evolution.\nPractical application\nOur results can be used to predict the evolution of protein function based on the knowledge of the neutral evolution of the protein. This could be useful in many practical applications, such as protein design and protein engineering.\nTheoretical implications\nOur results suggest that the effects of neutral evolution on functional evolution should be taken into account in the theory of molecular evolution.\nFuture research\nWe plan to investigate the mechanism of the effect of neutral evolution on functional evolution."}
{"text":"\n\nWe develop a topological classification scheme for clusters in condensed phases, extending our previous classification scheme for clusters in the gas phase. Our approach is based on the notion of a cluster topology algorithm, which generates a unique signature for a given cluster, based on the symmetry properties of the clusters' coordination polyhedra. We show that these cluster topology algorithms can be conveniently expressed in terms of the so-called \"acs\" variables, which describe the detailed arrangement of atoms in the cluster. We derive a set ofcluster topology algorithms which are sufficient to classify all clusters in the sense that two clusters sharing the same algorithm are topologically equivalent. We demonstrate the utility of our classification scheme by identifying various classes of clusters which are topologically distinct from each other, yet have similar properties in many other respects. We also show how our classification scheme can be used to derive a set of guidelines for the design of cluster packings with desired properties, such as high symmetry, a large number of clusters, or a small number of different cluster types."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a new image representation, which we call a hierarchical grid spatial index, that is designed to improve the efficiency of evaluating queries that require aggregation of image pixels within a specified rectangle. To generate this representation, we first divide each image into a number of tiles. We then identify the edges of these tiles and the boundaries between foreground and background regions. Based on this information, we compute a hierarchical clustering of the tiles to obtain a compact representation of the images. To evaluate a query, we traverse this hierarchy from the root node to the leaf nodes that intersect the query rectangle. We aggregate the pixel values at each level by summing the values in the child nodes. Finally, we return the result to the user. We show that this new representation is particularly useful for evaluating spatial queries that require the aggregation of image pixels within a rectangle. We present experimental results that demonstrate the efficiency of our representation compared to the naive approach of evaluating such queries."}
{"text":"\n\nWe study theoretically the spin relaxation due to the Bir-Aronov-Pikus mechanism in intrinsic and $p$-type GaAs quantum wells from a fully microscopic approach. The system is modeled by a quantum well with a Rashba barrier. A simple model of the basis-flop atomistic spin relaxation is employed. The single-particle basis renormalization and its anisotropy are calculated within the framework of the Green's function technique. The analysis of the anisotropy of the basis renormalization reveals the existence of an easy axis of magnetization in the quantum well. The easy axis of magnetization is found to be along the direction of the $p$-layer of the quantum well for the intrinsic type and along the direction of the quantum well for the $p$-type GaAs quantum well. The analysis of the spin relaxation due to the basis renormalization for the $p$-type GaAs quantum well shows that the relaxation is due to a single-particle mechanism, and that it has a minimum at a particular value of the spin-splitting energy."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate the statistics of the local order parameter at random critical points in disordered systems by developing a multifractal formalism that allows us to analyze the criticality of wetting transitions in periodically and quasiperiodically disordered media. We find that the criticality of such transitions is sensitive to the type of disorder and to the range of the order parameter. We analyze the occurrence of scale-free criticality and find that it is more frequent in quasiperiodic disordered systems, whereas in periodically disordered media scale-free criticality is robust only in a very small range of the order parameter. We also analyze the statistics of the local order parameter in a model of a disordered superlattice, which shows that the scale-free criticality found in real disordered systems is accurately reproduced by the model. Our results suggest that the mechanism of criticality in disordered systems is intrinsically multifractal, with different critical behaviors occurring in different ranges of the order parameter, and that criticality in disordered systems can be accurately reproduced by simple models."}
{"text":"\n\nWe investigate the evaporation of buffer gas-thermalized anions out of a multipole rf ion trap. The problem of anion loss from a quadrupole ion trap is studied via a Monte Carlo algorithm which describes the collisions between anions and the buffer gas. The dependence of the anion loss rate on the buffer gas pressure, trap voltage and frequency as well as on the thermal velocity of the anions is investigated. We find that anion loss is mostly due to a finite number of large amplitude vibrations which are excited by the buffer gas collisions. Our results are in good agreement with an analytical theory, which is based on the assumption of a large number of thermalized anions. The agreement of the two approaches provides a good test of the respective theories. We also found that anion loss is significantly higher for anions with a large charge to mass ratio than for anions with a small charge to mass ratio. This is explained by a Boltzmann distribution of the thermalized anions in the trap. Finally we found that anion loss is much more efficient if the anions are resonantly excited by an rf field."}
{"text":"\n\nWe have developed a simple model multicellular organism that resembles the real multicellular organism Dictyostelium in several aspects. The model organism is composed of a large number of cells that can communicate with each other via gap junctions. Each cell is modeled as a set of compartments that represent the internal structures of the cell, such as the nucleus, the Golgi apparatus, the endoplasmic reticulum, etc. We used a modified version of the Kermit algorithm to obtain a color-based distinction between the different internal structures. This is achieved by analyzing the 3-dimensional structure of the cells, in particular, the topology of the transport network. The transport network is constructed from the 3-d pixel connectivity, using the information of the location of the internal structures. The communication via the gap junctions is reflected in a long-range synchronization of the internal structures. We show that this model can undergo a development similar to the one observed in the real Dictyostelium. In particular, we observe a transition from a disordered state, in which the cells are not synchronized, to a ordered state, in which the cells are synchronized. This transition is accompanied by a fast increase in the number of gap junctions. We discuss the mechanism of the development and the similarities and differences between the model and the real organism."}
{"text":"\nWe study cosmological perturbations in Palatini modified gravity. We consider a Palatini term in the Einstein- Hilbert action, which is proportional to the first derivative of the scalar curvature with respect to the radius of the sphere, which parametrizes the Einstein- Hilbert action. We show that this term does not change the structure of the Einstein- Hilbert action, and thus the solution to the Einstein- Hilbert equation is unchanged. We also show that this term does not change the energy conservation. However, this term changes the equations for the gravitational waves, and in particular it can produce a gravitational wave which does not have a vanishing second derivative at the turning points. We analyze the structure of the solutions with this non-zero second derivative, and we show that they describe a generic mechanism of generation of a kind of gravitational waves, which are not present in the Einstein gravity. We show that this non-traditional gravitational waves can be generated by the motions of the relativistic particles, if their speeds are not too large. We also show that this kind of gravitational waves can be generated by a special kind of solutions, which are invariant under the Affine transformation. We show also that the traditional gravitational waves are generated by a particular class of solutions, which are invariant under the Projective transformation. Finally, we discuss the physical meaning of the non-traditional gravitational waves, and we suggest that they can be generated by a certain kind of quantum gravity."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present hard X-ray observations of the high-redshift radio-loud quasar RBS315 taken with Suzaku. The 2-keV peak luminosity is 6.3 kpc^( \u22122) , which is a factor of 2.4 above the value expected from the radio power, and a factor of 1.6 above the prediction from the 1.4-keV luminosity. The 4-keV luminosity is a factor of 2.4 above the 2-keV value. These data require a low energy cut-off in the accretion flow with a power law index of -0.7 and a temperature of 3 keV. This is consistent with the expectations from the reflection model for quasars with low accretion rates, but inconsistent with the hypothesis that a low energy cut-off at a few keV is due to a portential accretion barrier at a few stellar radii from the black hole. We discuss this in the framework of the tidally disrupted satellite model for quasars with low accretion rates. The main body of the paper is an analysis of the hard X-ray data in the framework of the reflection model. We show that the data are consistent with a reflector with a high ionization fraction and a relatively high emissivity, such as a very low mass accretion disc with a hot corona. We discuss the relatively high temperature of the accretion disc (a few keV) in the framework of the grazing incidence model."}
{"text":"\n\nWe report on the transport properties of single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) interconnects in a magnetic resonant tunneling device, where the tunnel barrier is a II-VI semiconductor with a perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. The anisotropy is derived from the spin-orbit coupling and is controlled by a perpendicular magnetic field. We show that a transport current in such a device is sensitive to the SWNT's spin-polarization, and can be used to manipulate the SWNT's magnetic state. The SWNT's transport behavior is characterized by a positive or negative spin-dependent charge transfer, depending on the relative orientation of the SWNT's and barrier's magnetic moments. We demonstrate a fabrication process for a device, where the SWNT is embedded in the barrier, resulting in a high efficiency of the spin-dependent charge transfer. Our results suggest that such a device can be used as a spin-valve, where the charge transfer is controlled by a gate voltage and depends on the SWNT's spin-polarization."}
{"text":"\nWe present general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of accretion disk instabilities in the presence of a central supermassive black hole. We consider the stability of meridional circulation in the disk and find that the associated torques may give rise to periodic or quasi-periodic flux modulations, provided that the torques are not too small and the disk is sufficiently close to the black hole. We discuss the conditions for the occurrence of such modulations and the associated torque and temperature variations. We show that these modulations are likely to be observed as episodic increases in the mass accretion rate, and we present a possible physical interpretation of such episodes in terms of correlations between the accretion rate and the torques generated by meridional circulation. We find that the amplitudes of the modulations are small unless the disk is very close to the black hole, in which case the associated temperature variations can be large enough to drive thermohaline circulation. We also discuss the effects of angular momentum transport by meridional circulation on the evolution of the black hole spin and the possibility of spin-up and spin-down events."}
{"text":"\n\nPulse-shape discrimination with the Counting Test Facility\n\nWe report on a study of the dynamics of ionization and excitation in clusters with the Counting Test Facility (CTF) at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility. We compare the shapes of clusters produced by ionization with those produced by excitation and show that they differ. We explain this difference by a model in which the energy deposition by the ionizing particle is divided between the parent cluster and the daughter clusters in a statistical manner. The model parameters are determined from the fit to the experimental data and used to predict the number of daughter clusters produced by ionization of a linear cluster. The comparison between the experimental data and the model prediction shows good agreement. We also report on a method for the determination of the relative importance of the ionization and excitation contributions to the cluster production cross section, which is based on the analysis of the average cluster size and the distribution of cluster sizes."}
{"text":"\nWe consider the scalar wave equation in a non-commutative spherically symmetric space-time. The problem is motivated by a desire to understand the dynamics of waves in space-times that do not preserve the commutative property, which is a basic assumption in classical mechanics. The key ideas and methodology are to introduce a non-commutative space-time by considering a one-dimensional (1D) Lorentzian manifold with a non-trivial, non-commutative symmetric trilinear form, and to study the resulting wave equation. The results obtained are that the wave equation is well-defined on the non-commutative space-time, and that the solutions of the wave equation are related to the solutions of the classical wave equation on the symmetric space-time. The problem this work attempts to solve is to understand the dynamics of waves in non-commutative space-times, and in particular to determine the conditions under which the classical equations of wave mechanics are well-defined and have solutions that are meaningful. The practical applications of this work are in the area of quantum mechanics, where the non-commutative space-time is a natural setting for the dynamics of quantum particles. The theoretical applications of this work are in the area of general relativity, where the non-commutative space-time is a natural setting for the dynamics of gravitational waves."}

{"text":"\nProton and heavy-ion therapy are considered as an alternative to conventional radiotherapy in the treatment of tumors. A major concern in the application of these new therapies is the uncertainty of the delivered dose due to the intrinsic stochasticity of the particle tracks. The traditional way to deal with this uncertainty is to use an empirical formula to convert the measured tracks to a equivalent fluence. In this work we present a different approach based on a Monte Carlo model which is able to simulate the tracks of the particles. The model is able to reproduce the experimental data for the fluence and the dose distribution in water. The model is validated by comparison with experimental data and by the simulation of different treatment scenarios. The results show that the stochasticity of the tracks has a significant impact on the delivered dose and on the design of the treatment plan. The model can be used to study the effect of different physical parameters on the track structure and to optimize the performance of the therapy."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider the ground state of a continuous family of quantum spin chains which is generalized from the most basic quantum spin chain, the so-calledTPS chain, to a chain with an arbitrary number of spins per site. In order to evaluate the ground state we use an exact diagonalization method which is based on the use of so-called Time Reversed Gate operations. In the case of the TPS chain the ground state has recently been calculated by different groups with different methods, however, in all cases the ground state turns out to be a dimer. Our method is exact and has not been tried for the TPS chain, but we show that it gives the expected result for the case of the TPS chain. We also consider a generalized chain with an arbitrary number of spins per site and evaluate the ground state by our method. In both cases we find a dimer ground state. The method can be easily generalized to chains with an arbitrary number of spins per site, and we expect that it will be able to evaluate the ground state in cases where it is not known."}
{"text":"\nWe report on the nature of the magnetic excitations in La2CuO4 probed by indirect resonant inelastic X-ray scattering. We found a good agreement between the theoretical prediction and the experimental data for the three-dimensional structure of the magnetic excitations.

Our data are consistent with the presence of a non-degenerate singlet state with a magnetic moment of 2.4 Bohr magneton. We found good agreement between the theory and the experiment for the temperature dependence of the singlet fraction. Our results indicate that the singlet state is a true quantum state, which is in strong disagreement with the predictions of the simple Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) model. We also found a good agreement between the theory and the experiment for the three-dimensional structure of the triplet excitations. We found that the PBE model can accurately describe the temperature dependence of the triplet fraction.

{"text":"\n\nForward stagewise regression and the monotone lasso\n\nWe consider the problem of statistical learning from datasets with many variables that are correlated with each other, where the goal is to predict a single response variable. We propose a forward stagewise regression model, which is an adaptation of the backward stagewise regression model to the setting of statistical learning from many variables. We show that the proposed model is equivalent to an application of the monotone lasso to the problem of learning a monotone function that maps variables to a response. The model selection aspects of the lasso are formalized in a way that allows us to relate the model selection problem to the problem of identifying the set of informative variables. We develop an algorithm to compute the optimal solution to the forward stagewise regression problem, and we show that the proposed algorithm has the same parameter as the well-known forward selection algorithm. We provide an experimental comparison of the proposed model with several other statistical learning methods on simulated and real datasets, and we show that the proposed model can be easily implemented using existing software packages."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider a recently proposed method to cool atomic gases that does not require the atoms to be laser cooled or trapped. This method relies on the collective excitation of the atomic gas by a sequence of coherent light pulses, which is possible thanks to the giant photon absorption cross section and the narrow width of the electronic energy levels in atomic gases. In this work we study this cooling method in more detail, with the aim of understanding the fundamental physical mechanisms that determine its efficiency. In particular, we consider the role of the atomic interaction, which is an important and poorly understood quantity in atomic gases, and we show that it has a strong influence on the cooling rate. We also propose a simple method to estimate the cooling rate, based on a model that relates the temperature, the density and the interaction, which can be used to predict the cooling rate as a function of the frequency of the light pulses. Our results suggest that this cooling method is efficient for temperatures above a few Kelvin, provided that the frequency of the light pulses is large enough."}
{"text":"\n\nThe close orbiting giant planet HD 75289b is one of the most ideal systems to search for a habitable secondary planet. We present high-resolution near-infrared spectroscopy with the NASA\/ESA Hubble Space Telescope of the atmosphere of the giant planet HD 75289b, obtained as part of the Hubble programme 'The Formation and Evolution of Planetary Systems'. We find that the dominant spectral feature is a strong methane absorption band, with a depth that varies by a factor of ten as the giant planet rotates. We have derived the methane abundance as relative to the molecule's intensity in the reference star HR 8799e. For HD 75289b this is 1.8 \u00b1 1.4, very similar to that derived for the giant planet HD 209458b. This implies that these giant planets must have formed with a large fraction of the mass in their atmospheres, a result supported by models of giant planet formation. In addition, the atmospheric temperature of HD 75 289b was derived to be 93 \u00b1 11 K, assuming a molecular weight of 46. This is very similar to that derived for HD 209458b, despite these two planets having very different masses. This confirms that mass alone is not a good tracer of the atmospheric temperature of giant planets. The high resolution of our data also allows a study of the non-LTE (local thermodynamic equilibrium) features in the atmosphere. The strength of the non-LTE features is inconsistent with a pure methane atmosphere, indicating a complex chemistry. Further analysis of these non-LTE features is needed to constrain the composition of the atmosphere."}
{"text":"\n\nFlaming, bright galaxies along the filaments of A2744\n\nWe present a detailed optical study of the rich clusters A2058 and A2744, which contain many spiral galaxies of very low surface brightness. We find that the spiral galaxies in both clusters are not only optically but also physically associated with the clusters' large-scale structure, following the clusters' filaments and clumps. In addition, the spiral galaxies show a strong tendency to align along the cluster's largest filaments, but only in those clusters in which the dominant galaxy population is also highly aligned. We discuss the possibility that the spiral galaxies are actively forming in the clusters' filaments, and that their alignment is due to the influence of the large-scale structure and the resulting distribution of matter and angular momentum. We find that in A2744 the alignment of the spiral galaxies is rather well explained by the distribution of the large-scale structure, but that in A2058 the distribution of the structure is less well described by the alignment of the spiral galaxies. We show that in A2058 the spiral galaxies tend to align with the clusters' small-scale structure, while in A2744 they align with the clusters' large-scale structure. We discuss the physical mechanism responsible for the alignment of the spiral galaxies with the clusters' large-scale structure in A2744."}

The new approach is applicable to a large class of inverse problems and enjoys several of the advantages of the Grassmannian algorithm, such as the use of low-dimensional Euclidean space and a direct method for the estimation of the solution vector. We show that in many cases the new approach results in a substantial reduction of the number of unknowns in the inverse problem and that it can be used to derive new explicit expressions for the solution vector. Furthermore, the proposed method is suitable for implementation on a computer and we present an illustrative example from the field of image processing."}
{"text":"\nWe study rates and characteristics of intermediate mass ratio inspirals (IMRIs) detectable by Advanced LIGO.

We find that a detection threshold of $M_{1.4} < m_{i} < M_{2.2}$ is likely to be reached by a 5 year LIGO run at design sensitivity, if the eccentricity distribution follows a broken power law with $\\alpha_+ > 1$ and $\\alpha_- > 1$. We also show that the expected rate of IMRIs is strongly dependent on the adopted orbital frequency, and we evaluate the optimal orbital frequency to maximize the detection rate.

We find that the accretion history of the system can be split into three distinct episodes, the last of which is still ongoing. The accretion episodes are punctuated by large gaps of several thousand accretion epochs, during which the accretion rate is several orders of magnitude smaller.

{"text":"\n\nWe propose a model that unifies the Planck scale in a supersymmetric standard model. Our model has a minimal number of supersymmetric excitations and contains gravity in its low-energy limit. We show that the model is invariant under a certain subgroup $\\Gamma$ of the standard model $\\mathrm{SM}$, and that the representations of the $\\Gamma$-invariant fermionic generators in the excited states of the model form a sequence of interlocked supersymmetric pairs, with the first pair being the gravitino-axion and the last pair being the light fermion-light antifermion. We show that the parameters of the model can be fixed by requiring that the representation of the Higgs boson in the highest excitation is the same as the standard model Higgs boson. We analyze the mass spectrum of the model and show that the only scalar mass that is smaller than the Planck scale is the axion mass, which may be as small as the smallest supersymmetric mass scale $m_{Pl}$. We show that the standard model may be considered as a subset of our model, and that the only necessary modification of the standard model is to include a second Higgs sector with a Yukawa coupling to the fermionic generators that is proportional to the inverse of the Higgs mass. We discuss the problem of integrating out the Dirac fermionic generators in the low-energy limit, and suggest that this may be done in a manner analogous to the integration of the Dirac mass in the standard model."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate the thermodynamics of an accretion disk annulus with comparable radiation and gas pressure. In particular, we consider the effect of temperature-dependent radiative cooling and gas viscosity on the temperature and density structure of the disk. We find that the temperature-dependent radiative cooling produces a temperature gradient in the disk, with the temperature increasing towards the inner edge of the annulus. The gas viscosity acts to balance this temperature gradient, producing a density structure with higher density towards the outer edge of the annulus. We also find that the gas viscosity has a non-monotonic dependence on the temperature, with the viscosity increasing initially with increasing temperature, and then decreasing towards the maximum. The increase in viscosity with temperature produces a strong gas pressure gradient in the annulus, with the gas pressure increasing towards the inner edge of the annulus. The combined effects of radiative cooling and gas viscosity produce a complex temperature and density structure in the disk, with temperature and density both increasing towards the inner edge of the annulus."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate the role of the Coulomb interaction in the crossover from an impurity band to the valence band in diluted magnetic semiconductors by means of an ab initio calculation. We find that the presence of the Coulomb interaction is essential for the crossover, in contrast to the case without the interaction. In particular, we show that the attraction between an impurity and a point-defect acceptor is the mechanism for the formation of the conducting charge-transfer (CT) state, in addition to the repulsion between an impurity and an impurity-acceptor. The competition between the attraction and the repulsion determines the depth of the impurity level in the CT state, and thus gives rise to a clear signature of the transition from the impurity band to the valence band in the form of a diverging density-of-states. We also analyze the effect of a magnetic field on the transition, and find that the interaction with the acceptor is weakened by the magnetic field, resulting in the suppression of the transition."}
{"text":"\nWe present surface structure observations in the mid-plane of a fully evacuated annulus, in which a radiative inner wall and a gas-pressurized outer wall are separated by a nearly uniform gap. Our observations show a clear signature of surface waves that we attribute to the presence of a true surface, despite the fact that the dominant surface tension force in the gap is directed radially inward. We attribute this to the comparable strength of the inward-directed surface tension and the outward-directed gas pressure forces. The inner surface is effectively stiffer than the outer surface, due to the higher surface tension. We show that this result can be understood from a simple consideration of the stress equilibrium on the two walls, in the limit of small surface wavelength. We observe a strong correlation between the wavelength of surface structures and the angle between the surface tension force and the radius, which is a direct signature of this effect. We also show that the same considerations would apply to an accretion disk, where the surface tension is balanced by the inward-directed centrifugal force. Our results suggest that the inner edge of the accretion disk is a true surface, despite the fact that the dominant surface tension force is directed radially inward."}
{"text":"\nWe present several results on directed star arboricity, a measure of the structural complexity of a graph that counts the number of stars subgraphs a graph contains. We show that this measure is related to the block model of the graph, and in particular that it is equal to the number of cliques in the block model plus one. We use this relation to show that if G is a graph with a large number of edges and a small number of stars, then G contains a large clique. We show that this result is tight in a natural sense. We present an algorithm to compute the number of stars in a graph, and show that it has a good constant. We show that this measure is almost as easy to compute as the number of edges, in that the number of stars in a graph is within a constant factor of the number of edges for almost all graphs.

This object is a member of the Serpens Cloud, a group of starless cores with complex chemistries, and is the only known core in which a fully developed pulsating photosphere is presently observable. We find that the photospheric radius varies by $\\sim 3\\%$ over the course of the 11.6 day period, and that the mean density within the photosphere is $\\sim 0.01\\, \\text{pc}^{-3}$.

We show that the high density is likely the result of a processes such as dust aggregation and settling that occur within the photosphere, and that this process is responsible for the 11.6 day oscillation.

{"text":"\nWe present photometric observations of the peculiar evolved starless core, FeSt 1-457, in which a significant fraction of the mass is in a compact, rotating, onion-like structure, the inner layers of which are likely to be degenerate. The core is found to exhibit non-radial pulsation with a frequency of 9.3 Hz and a magnitude variation of  \u223c 1.5 mag. The photometric variations are consistent with a model in which the inner layers of the core are characterised by a resonant instability, possibly due to the bulk motion of the gas or the fragmentation of the core. We discuss the dynamical state of the core and compare the present observations with earlier data. We show that the non-radial modulation has a different nature than the regular radial modulation previously reported. Our observations suggest that the outer layers of the core are relatively stable and that the inner layers are in a highly dynamic state. The high frequency of the non-radial oscillations and the relatively large amplitude suggest that the system is close to a bifurcation, possibly to the 3-body problem, and that it is relatively sensitive to perturbations. We discuss the nature of the observed non-radial modulation and suggest that it could be due to a combination of several harmonics, the relative amplitude of which depends on the precise structure of the core. Our results suggest that the non-radial mode is close to a resonant state, possibly due to the fragmentation of the core, in which the amplitude is relatively large and the frequency is high."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate the possibility of a nontrivial geometry of the universe, and present bounds on the curvature and topology of spacetime that are implied by the assumption that the universe is spatially homogenous and isotropic. We show that the assumption of spatial homogeneity and isotropy allows one to immediately obtain a bound on the largest possible radius of a spherically symmetric space-time, and that this bound is not compatible with the assumption of a nontrivial topology. We then show that this bound can be tightened by using the fact that a nontrivial geometry would imply the existence of a privileged reference frame. We also show that the bound is tight for any spatially inhomogeneous and anisotropic universe that can be described by a spherically symmetric space-time with a radius that is smaller than the bound. We then present a physical argument that the bound is tight for a large class of possible inhomogeneous and anisotropic universes. The argument is based on the idea that if the universe has a nontrivial geometry, then this should be immediately visible in the form of preferred directions and a non-trivial spectrum of the cosmic microwave background radiation. We show that this argument implies a bound on the length of the longest diameter of the universe, and that this bound is tight for a large class of possible geometries. We finally present a general procedure for obtaining tight bounds on the curvature and topology of the universe, based on the assumption that the universe is locally similar to a spherically symmetric space-time."}

Our approach is based on the observation that the usual definition of an h-principle is essentially a categorification of the intuitive idea of a \"privileged\" functor, in the sense of category theory. Therefore, our first step is to categorify the definition of an h-principle. This allows us to give a natural generalization of Vassiliev's h-principle to the setting of higher categories. As an application, we give a description of left Kan extensions in terms of higher h-principles."}
{"text":"\n\nA mathematical and computational review of Hartree-Fock SCF methods in Quantum Chemistry\n\nThe energy representation of the electronic structure of a molecule is a fundamental concept in quantum chemistry, which has a direct bearing on the accuracy of both experimental and theoretical molecular properties. The Hartree-Fock (HF) self-consistent field (SCF) method is the simplest approach to the solution of the electronic structure problem, and it forms the basis for the calculation of molecular properties in quantum chemistry. We present a review of the mathematics and computation of the HF-SCF method, with a focus on the rigorous derivation of the HF-SCF equations and the numerical solution of the resulting equations. We discuss the problem of converging the numerical solution of the HF-SCF equations, and review the various algorithms that have been proposed for the numerical solution of the HF-SCF equations. We also discuss the accuracy of the HF-SCF method, and review the various ways in which the method has been improved to achieve greater accuracy. Finally, we discuss the applications of the HF-SCF method to the calculation of molecular properties."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider the stability of the periodic Toda lattice under short range perturbations. We find that the Toda lattice is stable against the disintegration of the lattice when the coupling constant is strictly between the Toda and the anti-Toda thresholds. We also find that the Toda lattice is stable against the formation of the anti-Toda lattice when the coupling constant is strictly below the Toda threshold. However, we show that the Toda lattice is unstable against the formation of the anti-Toda lattice when the coupling constant is in the interval between the Toda and anti-Toda thresholds. We analyze the mechanism of the lattice disintegration in the case when the coupling constant is above the Toda threshold. We also analyze the mechanism of the lattice formation in the case when the coupling constant is below the anti-Toda threshold. Our analysis is based on the use of the Birkhoff polytope. We also derive an approximate formula for the fraction of the Toda lattice in the mixed state in the case when the coupling constant is in the interval between the Toda and anti-Toda thresholds."}
{"text":"\n\nWe study the transport of angular momentum (AM) in radiative accretion disks with turbulent viscosity, using a simple model of the disk-rotor system, where the turbulence is driven by the magneto-rotational instability (MRI). We show that there exists a unique scaling law for the transport of AM in such disks, which depends only on the dimensionless MRI torque and the disk's efficiency in converting the MRI energy to turbulence. The presence of a unique scaling law for AM transport in the disk eliminates the possibility of an eigenmode-based mechanism for the transport of AM in the disk. Our analysis also shows that the assumption of a constant efficiency in the conversion of the MRI energy to turbulence, which is used in most of the recent studies of AM transport in accretion disks, is not realistic. We show that this efficiency depends on the magnitude of the MRI torque, and thus, it cannot be a free parameter in the model of the disk-rotor system. Finally, we study the effect of the inner boundary condition for AM on the transport of AM in the disk. We find that the choice of the inner boundary condition for AM has a significant effect on the transport of AM in the disk, and thus, it cannot be neglected in the analysis of AM transport in the disk."}

{"text":"\n\nWe present a formalism to constrain the dark energy density through its signature on the anisotropic power spectrum of the matter distribution in a galaxy cluster. The formalism is based on the comparison of the measured power spectrum with the one expected from an isotropic distribution of matter in a harmonic potential well. The potential well is created by the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) of the matter distribution. The BAO scale is determined from the observed correlation function and used to set the scale of the potential well. We show that the difference between the measured and the predicted power spectrum is sensitive to the dark energy density and can be used to set a bound on the dark energy density. We find that the current observations are consistent with a dark energy density that is less than a certain value, which depends on the BAO scale. The BAO scale can be determined from current observations with an accuracy of about 10%. We discuss the current constraints on the dark energy density and the prospects of future observations."}
{"text":"\nWe present numerical simulations and observations of the effects of accretion shock heating on the evolution of molecular clouds in galactic halos. We find that a significant fraction of the gas in the inner part of the halos is heated to temperatures well above the critical temperature for molecular hydrogen, and that this fraction increases with accretion rate. For molecular clouds in these hot halos, we show that the virialization timescale decreases with increasing temperature, and that the clouds are able to survive for much longer times than clouds in the cold halos. We discuss a mechanism that can explain the simultaneous heating and longevity of molecular clouds in hot halos, based on the idea that the clouds are able to thermally stratify and thus to protect their inner regions from direct heating by the shock. We also discuss the effects of the hot halos on the chemical composition of the gas in the clouds, and we show that the chemical evolution is different in cold and hot halos. In particular, we find that the hot halos contain less heavy elements than the cold halos, in qualitative agreement with observations of the chemical composition of the gas in the Galactic halo."}
{"text":"\n\nThe Shapes of Molecular Cloud Cores in Orion\n\nWe present a catalog of 19 high-mass young stellar objects (YSOs) in the Orion molecular cloud. The data were obtained as part of the Sakai cluster survey with the Nobeyama Radio Observatory Millimeter\/Submillimeter Telescope. We targeted a large number of sources which were observed with the WENSSEN (The Wisconsin-Indiana-Norway Superconducting Telescope) and were identified as likely to be high-mass YSOs. The majority of the sources are low-power millimeter sources. We observed these sources in three frequency bands, 42 GHz, 86 GHz, and 150 GHz, with a resolution of 1.3 arcmin. We find that the observed sources are distributed within three regions, which correspond to the regions where the WENSSEN data were obtained. These regions are the Northern Ridge, the Southern Ridge, and the stellar association \u03bd Orionis. We conclude that the non-detections in our survey are due to the following reasons: 1) the objects are very distant and thus appear small, 2) the objects are very compact and thus have a low surface brightness, and 3) the objects are very young and still hidden by the natal cloud. We derive a simple formula which is used to estimate the beaming ratio from the 42 GHz to 150 GHz data. We find that the beaming ratio is in the range of 2-4. We also find that the star formation efficiency in the regions of the Orion cloud we have surveyed is 5-10%. We present a catalog of 19 high-mass YSOs in the Orion cloud. The derived masses are 3-8 times the mass of the sun. The lifetime of the objects is estimated to be in the range of 5-10 thousand years. We find that the observed sources are not well described by a single power law. A possible explanation for this is that the cloud has been shedding stars throughout its lifetime. We discuss the future prospects of the field and the need for a large scale molecular cloud core survey."}
{"text":"\nWe discuss the (non) gauge invariance of effective actions in gauge theories with a view towards clarifying the relation between the different notions of gauge invariance which are commonly used in the context of effective actions. In particular we focus on the question of whether the most commonly used definition of gauge invariance is the appropriate one in this context. We show that in general the answer is no, and that the standard definition is only meaningful if the effective action is understood as an effective Lagrangian density. We also review the notion of a gauge transformation as used in effective field theory and discuss the relation to the more abstract definition of a gauge transformation as a mapping which takes each physical state to a new state which is related by the Poincar\u00e9 group. We show that the standard definition of gauge invariance of effective actions is equivalent to the statement that the Poincare group acts on the space of effective Lagrangian densities. We finally discuss the relation of our results to the question of whether effective actions are unique."}
{"text":"\nWe study symmetric and asymmetric solitons in linearly coupled Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) trapped in optical lattices. We show analytically and numerically that a symmetric soliton of the form |\u03c8\u27e9= c1 |1\u27e9 + c2 |2\u27e9 has several special points of stability, at which the energy density takes the form |\u03c8\u27e9= (c1 \u00b1 c2) |1\u27e9. The special points of stability are equally spaced in the energy diagram and they are related to the zeros of the coupling constant. We find that the soliton can be stable against long-range forces and therefore it can be used to explain the structure of lattices with aperiodic long-range forces. Our results are consistent with the stability criteria proposed by Verstraete and Georges in a recent article. Asymmetric solitons of the form |\u03c8\u27e9= c1 |1\u27e9 + c2 |2\u27e9 are more complex. In particular we find that there are three different types of so called gradient solitons, which can be related to the zeros and the poles of the coupling constant. Our analysis shows that a large number of previously proposed solitons can be understood in the framework of the theory developed here."}
{"text":"\nWe report on a method to measure the spin-spin correlation function and magnetoelastic coupling in a quantum magnet by means of time-domain dynamic strain spectroscopy. We show that the technique can be used to determine the correlation function in a transverse direction, which is not accessible with static magnetometry. Our approach is based on the combination of a magnetic field pulse, which is applied along the easy axis of the magnet, and a subsequent strain pulse, which is applied along a direction perpendicular to the magnetic field. The resulting transient change in the magnetization is measured with a SQUID magnetometer. From the dependence of the transient on the relative timing of the field and strain pulses, we determine the magnetoelastic coupling and the spin-spin correlation function. Our method does not require a preliminary characterization of the sample and is therefore applicable to materials in which static magnetometry is not feasible, such as in single-molecule magnets."}
{"text":"\nWe present a method for identifying and characterizing the regions surrounding galaxies which are responsible for the observed large-scale flows of galaxies in the local volume. We find a good agreement between the regions identified as responsible for the large-scale flows and those found to contain a large number of galaxies with colors similar to those of galaxies in the local volume. In addition, we find that the surface density of these regions increases in a way that is consistent with the observed large-scale flows. We also find that the local volume contains a large number of regions with high surface density and with colors similar to those of galaxies in the local volume, but that it does not contain regions with low surface density and with colors similar to those of galaxies in the local volume. This is consistent with the hypothesis that the local volume is contained within a large-scale structure, and that the large-scale flows observed in the local volume are due to the infall of matter from regions outside the local volume. We discuss several implications of our results for theories of structure formation and for the understanding of the large-scale structure of the Universe."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) from the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) as part of theCosmic Streaming Epoch Explorer (COSEX) project.

We use this data set to search for evidence of non-Gaussian structure in the CMB, which may provide a signature of primordial non-Gaussianity or a more recent origin such as fluctuations due to density fluctuations in a streaming fluid. We find no evidence of non-Gaussian structure in the CMB at the level of $\\sim 3 \\sigma$. We set a limit on the amplitude of a sinusoidal wave in the CMB of $\\sim 2 \\times 10^{-8}$.

{"text":"\n\nWe show that any entangled pure state of two qubits can be transformed into any other such state using only operations that can be implemented efficiently. The technique is based on the fact that any entangled state can be approximated arbitrarily closely by a state that can be obtained by successive separable operations and classical communication. We show that thisapproximation process can be understood as the approximation of a path integral representation of the evolution of the quantum state with respect to aparameterized family of operations. We phrase this evolution in terms of theano metric, a natural way to parameterize the operations in this family. This representation makes it possible to choose the parameters so that the evolution is close to the one that can be described by a path integral over the full family. This gives a simple recipe toapproximate any entangled state using only separable operations and classical communication. We show that our recipe is practically feasible by implementing it with superconducting circuits."}
{"text":"\n Background:\n Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is a powerful diagnostic tool for the detection of proteins in tissues, both in normal and in pathological samples. We have previously shown that insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) is a sensitive and specific marker for the diagnosis of thyroid carcinomas. In the present study we aimed to investigate the expression of IDE in a variety of normal and pathological tissues, in order to evaluate its possible use as a pan-cancer marker.\n Methods:\n We performed an IHC analysis of IDE expression in 21 normal tissues and in 44 samples of tumors from different tissues of origin, including breast, colon, lung, skin, kidney, ovary, pancreas, stomach, and uterus. We also analyzed the expression of IDE in samples of normal and cancerous thyroid tissues. We used a polyclonal antibody against IDE, and the reaction was visualized by means of an avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex.\n Results:\nIDE was readily detectable in all normal tissues investigated except for brain and lung. In thyroid tissues, IDE expression was detected in the normal samples, as well as in the carcinomas, with no difference in the intensity of the reaction between the two groups. In all other tumor samples, IDE expression was found to be negative, with the exception of 1 case of colon carcinoma and 1 case of uterine carcinoma, in which a weak IDE reaction was observed.\n Conclusions:\nOur results suggest that IDE could be useful as a pan-cancer marker, and that its expression in thyroid carcinomas is independent of the tumor's differentiation status."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider a one-dimensional Ising model with a periodically modulated non-Ising interaction $J$ in a magnetic field $H$. For a large number $N$ of spins, the system is shown to be mapped into an effective Ising model with a non-collinear $J$ field along the spins. The only states with $J>0$ are those with $N$ up spins in a row, and the only states with $J<0$ are those with $N$ down spins in a row. For a small number $N$ of spins, a more detailed analysis shows that the system is mapped into an effective Ising model with a collinear $J$ field along the spins. However, a finite number of non-Ising states with $J>0$ or $J<0$ can still be achieved by a careful choice of the field $H$. By using a golden section method, we obtain the criterion for the Ising model to be mapped into an effective model with the non-collinear $J$ field, which is shown to be equivalent to the golden section of the spins. Our results show that the Ising model is especially efficient in creating and propagating order along spin chains."}

{"text":"\n\nHD 98800: A 10-Myr-Old Transition Disk\n\nWe present high-resolution observations of the disk surrounding the young solar-like star HD 98800. These data include images obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) that reveal the disk to be a transition disk with a diameter of approximately 80 au. We find that the disk is comprised of two distinct parts: a compact inner region with a radius of approximately 20-30 au and a more extended outer region with a radius of approximately 50-80 au. The disk is generally well-circumscribed by a rim, except for a cavity of approximately 5-10 au in radius at the position of the terrestrial planet mass companion discovered in 2005. We estimate that the mass of the disk is 41 lunar masses (0.2 Earth masses) assuming a density of 1.6 g cm^3. We discuss the possible formation mechanisms for the disk and examine the potential for the disk to evolve into an analog of the solar system. We find that if the disk was formed by the accretion of planetesimals, it would have required an accretion rate of 0.01 Earth masses per Myr, similar to the rate estimated for the growth of the giant planets. We discuss the relative amounts of material in the disk and the likelihood that this disk may be the remains of a tumultuous planet formation process. We also examine the disk's habitability and find that the disk has a volatile content of approximately 0.01 Earth masses and a dust mass of approximately 0.02 Earth masses. We conclude that this disk is unlikely to be a habitable analog for the solar system, and thus is not a likely candidate for the search for extraterrestrial life. We discuss the implications of this disk for planet formation theory, and we highlight the need for further observations, both to verify our basic characterization of this disk and to better constrain the disk's properties."}
{"text":"\n\nWe investigate the effects of short-range attractions on the structural order, self-diffusivity, and viscosity of a fluid. We consider a simple model in which the fluid is described by a continuous symmetry and the interactions between the components of the fluid are described by a short-range potential. The model can be solved exactly, and we find that the resulting solution displays a transition from a disordered state to a state with long-range order as the strength of the short-range interaction increases. We also find that the self-diffusivity and viscosity of the fluid increase as the strength of the short-range interaction increases.\n\nWe propose that our results can be understood in terms of the way in which the short-range interaction modifies the local structure of the fluid.

{"text":"\n\nWe present here results of a systematic study of the interaction of the supernova remnant (SNR) G18.8+0.3 with molecular clouds. We have searched for radio sources in the region of the SNR with the Australia Telescope and have found a jet in the northern part of the remnant. We have also observed the region in X-ray with the Chandra Observatory and have found that the gas in the remnant is mainly in the form of a toroid with a hot inner rim and a cold outer rim. These two observations together provide strong evidence that the toroidal gas is the result of the interaction of the supernova with a molecular cloud. The strength of the interaction has been such that much of the molecular cloud has been compressed to form hot gas, but a part of the cloud has survived the interaction and has been partly ionized by the supernova. We have developed a model in which the toroidal gas is formed by the superposition of the initially radial shocked gas and the non-shocked molecular cloud. This model successfully reproduces many of the properties of the toroidal gas. We also discuss the effects of the interaction on the remnant itself."}
{"text":"\nWe present new observations of the absorbing sites along the sightlines to several gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). We find that the absorbers are composed of gas in a few cases, but are dominated by dust in most cases. We show that the absorbers in the polar region of the GRB plane are significantly different from those in the equatorial region, with a higher incidence of dust and a lower incidence of gas. We also find that the distribution of the absorbing material in the bursts' host galaxies is strongly correlated with the distribution of the galaxies' stars, with a significant fraction of the absorbing material in the haloes of the galaxies. The distribution of the absorbers is consistent with the idea that the bursts occur in galaxies with a disturbed or merging morphology, but are not correlated with the presence of a central supermassive black hole. We show that the luminosities of the bursts are on average reduced by a factor of approximately 1.5 due to dust absorption, but that the reduction in the burst's peak luminosity is typically larger (by a factor of approximately 2.5), indicating that the dust absorption is relatively efficient in the burst's early phase. We discuss our results in the context of recent observations of galaxies with a similar absorbing structure in the optical and ultraviolet, and suggest that a major fraction of the absorbing material in the galaxies is at large (kiloparsec) scales, rather than within the burst's host galaxy.

We show that the non-saturating magnetoresistance exhibits a strong sensitivity to the structural and morphological properties of the inhomogeneous conductor. In particular, we show that the non-saturating magnetoresistance increases with the structural inhomogeneity of the conductor, and that it is possible to engineer the non-saturating magnetoresistance by introducing structural inhomogeneities in a uniform conductor. We also show that the non-saturating magnetoresistance decreases with increasing conductor thickness, and that it can be enhanced by patterning the conductor in a periodically repetitive structure. Our results suggest that the non-saturating magnetoresistance could be used as a probe for the structural and morphological properties of conductors.\n\nWe have designed and fabricated a planar inductor that can be integrated with a high-Q resonator. The inductor consists of a three-layer stack of a thin-film ferromagnetic layer, an insulating layer, and a conductor layer. The conductor layer is patterned into a periodically repetitive structure. We show that the inductor exhibits a strong non-saturating magnetoresistance, which increases with the structural inhomogeneity of the inductor. We also show that the non-saturating magnetoresistance can be tuned by the structural inhomogeneities in the inductor. The results suggest that the non-saturating magnetoresistance could be used as a probe for the structural and morphological properties of conductors."}
{"text":"\nWe study a class of f(R) gravity models in which the function f is given by a potential function, that includes a non-singular phantom crossing and a bulk viscosity, and in which the derivative of the bulk viscosity with respect to the scalar curvature is proportional to the bulk velocity. We show that the equation of state (EOS) of such models is well-defined and that these models are not equivalent to other f(R) models in which the EOS is a function of the bulk viscosity. We derive a constraint on the bulk viscosity in terms of the local gravity constraint, and show that this constraint is satisfied in the simplest phantom crossing model. We show further that for an f(R) model with a non-singular phantom crossing and bulk viscosity, the singularity of the model cannot be a function of the bulk viscosity. We show that an f(R) model with a non-singular phantom crossing and bulk viscosity is equivalent to a standard f(R) model with a bulk viscosity, but that the two models have different local gravity constraints. We show further that for an f(R) model with a non-singular phantom crossing and bulk viscosity, the singularity of the model cannot be a function of the bulk velocity. We discuss the implications of our results for the theory of f(R) gravity models with a bulk viscosity."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present photometric observations of the short-period horizontal-branch (HB) stars HP Librae and V803 Centauri, which allow a precise determination of their orbital periods. The observations cover several orbital revolutions and were obtained under uniform conditions for both stars. We find that the orbital period of HP Librae is 87.12 \u00b1 0.09 min, which is 11.4 \u00b1 0.9% longer than the period determined from the orbital elements derived from spectroscopy. The corresponding systematic effect on the orbital elements is within the formal uncertainty of the spectroscopic measurements. We discuss this period discrepancy with the help of recent models of the orbital evolution of these stars. We also present a detailed study of the full- amplitude behavior of the HB-star modulation in HP Librae. The observed modulation amplitude shows a clear signature of an exponential radial-distance variation superimposed on a linear one. We determine the characteristic parameters of both amplitude variations, and discuss the physical origin of the observed radial-distance variations. We find that the mass-loss rate during the evolution of the system is at most 2.3% of the total stellar mass per 1000 yr. The derived value is lower than the mass-loss rate derived from the observed orbital-elements evolution. We discuss the observed properties of HP Librae and V803 Centauri within the framework of recent theoretical models."}

We describe the LFD Field Prototype system and the motivation for the research, and report on the results of our pilot study for the detection of crab GPs. We describe the data processing pipeline and the criteria used to identify crab GPs, and present the frequency distribution of GP occurrence.

{"text":"\n\nWe consider the problem of viscous accretion onto a compact object from a large reservoir of gas, with the object and the gas at different temperatures. We solve the resulting viscous magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations in a mean-field approximation. We find that when the gas is at a lower temperature than the object, the accretion flow is turbulent and the turbulence is quenched by the temperature gradient in the direction of the flow, consistent with observations of accretion disks around black holes. The turbulence is characterized by a velocity distribution function with two different power-law exponents, one in the bulk of the disk and the other at the edge. We also find that the temperature distribution in the disk is log-normal and that the standard deviation of the temperature distribution is proportional to the temperature difference between the gas and the object. When the gas is at a higher temperature than the object, we find that the accretion flow is steady and stable, consistent with the observed accretion flow in the solar wind. We discuss the relevance of our results to the problem of accretion control."}
{"text":"\nWe present a new Bayesian methodology for the reconstruction of the large-scale structure of the Universe from galaxy redshift surveys. Our method is based on a hierarchical Bayes model that allows us to infer the underlying large-scale structure at the same time as we fit the observed galaxies to this structure. We show that this method provides a more natural way to infer the large-scale structure than the classical linear inversion method. Our new approach results in a highly non-linear optimization problem, and we present an efficient numerical method to solve this optimization problem. We apply our method to the case of the large-scale structure induced by a Gaussian random field. We show that our method is as efficient as the standard linear method, but that it is much more robust with respect to the choice of the prior and the observed galaxies. We finally discuss the generalization of our method to more complex models, and the implications of our method for the determination of the parameters of the model."}
{"text":"\n\nAbstract for: Combination of OFDM and CDMA for high data rate UWB\n\nWe propose a novel combination of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and code division multiple access (CDMA) for high data rate ultra-wideband (UWB) wireless communication. By utilizing the orthogonality of OFDM and the spreading and despreading of CDMA, the proposed scheme can achieve high data rate, low cost, low power consumption, and high reliability. In the proposed scheme, a wideband CDMA (WCDMA) architecture is used for the physical layer, and an OFDM architecture is used for the data link layer. The WCDMA architecture includes a chirp-like spreading sequence, which is used to achieve the wideband transmission, and a binary pseudorandom sequence, which is used for the channelization and the synchronization. The OFDM architecture includes a set of orthogonal subcarriers, which are used for the data transmission, and a set of orthogonal pilot signals, which are used for the synchronization and the channel estimation. The proposed scheme is evaluated by computer simulations, and the results show that the proposed scheme can achieve high data rate, low cost, low power consumption, and high reliability."}
{"text":"\nWe present the results of a systematic study of the phenomenology of the Next-To-MinimalSupersymmetricStandard Model (nMSSM) from the point of view of collider physics as well as cosmology. In the framework of the nMSSM we study the production of neutralinos, chargedinos and finally the lightweight Standard Model particles at hadron and lepton colliders. We show that in the case of a non-Standard Model (SM) Higgs sector, the main sources of the Higgs production are the associated production with quarks and the direct production through the top-quark. The corresponding cross sections are derived and the resulting direct and indirect discovery potential of the Higgs sector are evaluated. We then consider the possible consequences of the nMSSM on the evolution of the Universe. The model predicts the existence of a dark matter (DM) sector which can be described either by massive Dirac fermions or by massive Weyl fermions. The simplest form of the nMSSM, which contains only one Dirac fermionic DM particle, is analyzed. We show that in this case the Dirac fermionic DM can be a weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) with a mass smaller than the SM Planck scale, and we evaluate its abundance. The possible phenomenology of a nMSSM with more complex DM sector is also discussed."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present photometric and spectroscopic observations of the jet in the young stellar object 0836+710. The high-resolution spectroscopy, obtained with the IRS on board the Hubble Space Telescope, reveals, for the first time, the presence of a full transversal structure in a jet coming out of a young stellar object. The main jet axis is composed of two distinct parts, which we name the \"inner jet\" and the \"outer jet\". The inner jet is resolved in its entirety, while the outer jet is only partially resolved. We find that the inner jet has a much higher optical depth than the outer jet. The total mass-flow rate is estimated to be  \u223c 5  \u00d7 10 \u2212 8 M\u22c5yr \u2212 1. Our results suggest that the jet is not a simple inflated jet, but a double-component jet with different physical properties in the two components. We discuss several possible mechanisms that may have formed the observed transversal structure, and we suggest that the interaction between the jet and the surrounding medium is probably the most promising explanation."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider the problem of measuring the cosmic radiation density \u03c1_(\u22c5). The flux of cosmic rays measured on earth is proportional to \u03c1_(\u22c5)2, but the proportionality constant depends on the geometry of the detector and the distribution of matter in the universe. We show that, for the special case of a spherical detector, the proportionality constant can be evaluated from astronomical observations, and hence the cosmic radiation density can be derived. Within the framework of the standard model of cosmology, the density of matter is given by the relation \u03c1_(\u22c5)m \u221d \u03a9, where \u03a9 is the Hubble parameter. This relation sets an upper bound on the cosmic radiation density \u03c1_(\u22c5) \u223c \u03c1_(\u22c5)m\/\u03a9, if the density of matter is bounded from below by the observed value. This bound can be tested observationally. If the cosmic radiation density is higher than the bound, the standard model of cosmology would have to be modified. We show that the bound can be tested with the data of the cosmic microwave background radiation and the large scale structure in the universe. We discuss a simple model which can explain a cosmic radiation density higher than the bound."}
{"text":"\nWe study resonant Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) modes in a sheared relativistic flow. We find that the energy of the most unstable KH mode is very small compared to the energy of the flow. Therefore, the KH instability is strongly suppressed and the corresponding waves are extremely narrow. We also find that the energy of the least unstable KH mode is large compared to the energy of the flow. Therefore, the KH instability is strongly enhanced and the corresponding waves are very wide. Our results are consistent with the idea that the energy of the least unstable KH mode is a small part of the total energy of the flow, while the energy of the most unstable KH mode is a large part of the total energy of the flow. We also find that the least and most unstable KH modes have very different spatial structures. The least unstable mode has a very simple spatial structure, while the most unstable mode has a very complex spatial structure. Our results suggest that the least and most unstable KH modes are associated with different physical processes, and that the least and most unstable KH modes have different practical or theoretical applications."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a catalog of quasars lensed by globular clusters of spiral and elliptical galaxies. The quasars are selected from the 2 Micron All Sky Survey, and their lensing effects are recovered from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Lensed Image Catalog. We find 551 quasars which are lensed by 95 globular clusters. The clusters' mean optical depths are log(O\/I) = 1.38 \u00b1 0.01, where O is the cluster optical depth and I is the ionization integral. We find that the highest ionization clusters are those of elliptical galaxies, and that the ionization correlation is inversely proportional to the cluster distance from its host galaxy. We have developed a model in which quasars are hosted in galaxies which are embedded in haloes. In this model, the ionization of a globular cluster is a function of the cluster's radius, the cluster's distance from the galaxy's nucleus, and the galaxy's morphological type. This model is in good agreement with the observed correlation between cluster ionization and host galaxy morphological type. We find that the observed correlation between ionization and cluster distance from the galaxy is consistent with a power law correlation with an index of -1.84 \u00b1 0.02."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present photometric and spectroscopic observations of SDSSJ104341.53+085558.2, the second white dwarf found to host a debris disc, consisting of a dense inner disc of gas and a more extended disc of dust. We estimate the white dwarf's mass to be 1.36 \u00b1 0.07 MWD, and its temperature to be 713 \u00b1 19 K. The gas disc has a mass of 1.69 \u00b1 0.77 MSun, and is composed of hydrogen and helium in a roughly 50:50 ratio. The dust disc has a mass of 2.62 \u00b1 1.47 MSun, and is composed of silicates and iron. The dust-to-gas ratio is approximately 4. The observations needed to constrain the disc parameters are discussed. We estimate the accretion rate to be log(\u0393gas) = -0.44 \u00b1 0.03 and log(\u0393dust) = -0.25 \u00b1 0.15, where \u0393 is the gravitational accretion efficiency. The large accretion rate of the gas disc, and its relatively high helium abundance, suggest that the disc has been maintained by an alternative mechanism to the X-ray driven winds that are expected to be responsible for the gas discs around intermediate-mass white dwarfs. We discuss a model in which the gas disc is maintained by the white dwarf's magnetic field, in a similar fashion to the disc around SDSSJ101212.37+533236.1. We estimate the white dwarf's magnetic field to be log(B) = 3.15 \u00b1 0.39 BEarth, and discuss a model in which the field is driven by an inner magnetic pole, in a similar manner to that observed in the magnetic white dwarfs with a single magnetic pole."}
{"text":"\nWe consider the helicity generation and the alpha-effect by the Vandakurov-Tayler instability with z-dependent differential rotation. We show that the generated helicity is related to the structure of the instability kernel and the differential rotation. We find that the helicity generation by the instability is sensitive to the choice of the reference frame as well as the assumption of the small helix radius. We analyze the problem using the Fundamnetal Theorem of helicopter dynamics and find that the Helicity Generation Efficiency (HGE) is proportional to the second derivative of the density contrast with respect to the helix radius. The obtained HGE has a maximum value of about 0.6 for the kernel with a double maximum and the smallest helix radius is about 10 km for this case. We also found that the alpha-effect by the instability is related to the amplitude of the density waves and the initial conditions. The analysis of the problem using the Fundamental Theorem of helicopter dynamics shows that the Alpha-effect Efficiency (AE) has a maximum value of about 1.5 for the kernel with a double maximum and the amplitude of the density waves is about 0.05."}
{"text":"\n\nThe emergence of object-oriented databases (OODBs) has been driven by the need to integrate object-oriented systems and databases. The choice of an appropriate OODB is a complex task, which is further complicated by the existence of several competing OODBs. A number of performance measures have been proposed to compare OODBs. However, these measures do not capture the stochastic behavior of objects, a characteristic common to many object-oriented systems. In this paper, we present VOODB, a discrete-event random simulation model to evaluate the performance of OODBs. VOODB is a generic model that can be used to simulate the behavior of any system that is defined as a collection of classes. VOODB executes random instances of a set of classes in a simulation loop. The simulation loop is interrupted periodically to update the database and to retrieve data from it. The random behavior of the objects is captured by a set of probability distributions that are associated with the classes. VOODB is a generic tool that can be used to evaluate the performance of OODBs under random object behavior."}
{"text":"\nWe have discovered an unusual magneto-electric effect in BiFeO3, a multiferroic material. This effect is not present in the bulk form of the material, but only in a limited temperature region close to the structural phase transition. We show that this effect can be explained by a mechanism of magnetic domain wall motion assisted by an electromechanical instability. We have observed that the stray field of the magnetic domains can be enhanced by a factor of up to 2 by applying a small DC electric field, which results in a large electric field across the domain walls. This large field is necessary to drive the domain wall motion in the ordered state, in which the wall energy is increased by a geometric effect. We have also found that the wall motion is always accompanied by a large increase of the magnetic resistivity, by a factor of up to 3, in the same temperature region. We show that this increase can be explained by a model of elastic strain and magneto-mechanical coupling. Our results suggest that the exotic behavior of BiFeO3 is caused by a strong magneto-mechanical coupling in this material."}
{"text":"\nWe present the first detection of the forbidden transition SiI, at 6785 \u00c5, in a quasar absorber. The main motivation for our research is to investigate the distribution of the elements in the local Universe, in particular in the gas between galaxies, in order to understand the mechanisms of chemical enrichment and the process of element transfer from the intergalactic medium to galaxies. We have developed a new method to search for hidden weak features in quasar spectra which allows us to perform a detailed study of chemical composition of quasar absorbing clouds. Our new method combines asensitive optical technique with an optimal choice of quasar targets. We detected a cloud containing 1.5 kpc3 of cold metal-poor gas at z~0.45, which we traced with a weak MgII absorption line. The cloud contains 12% of the critical density to form stars, and more than 90% of the gas is hydrogen. We also detected for the first time in a quasar absorber the forbidden lines SiI at 6785 \u00c5, CaI at 5853 \u00c5, and FeI at 5270 \u00c5. The presence of these lines indicates that the gas is not completely neutral, and that the cloud has a complex chemical composition. We conclude that this cloud formed by the cooling and gravitational collapse of a large gas cloud, and that the gas is still cooling."}
{"text":"\nWe have determined the systematic uncertainties of the hadron parameters obtained with QCD sum rules in a hadron accelerator environment. The systematic uncertainties due to the hadronization process and the detector effects have been estimated from the theory and the experimental data, respectively. The theoretical uncertainty of the hadronization process is evaluated on the basis of the theoretical prediction and the experimental data for the hadron production in the hadron accelerator environment. The experimental uncertainty of the hadron parameters is evaluated on the basis of the measurement statistics and the control statistics for the hadron parameters. We found that the hadron parameters can be determined with an accuracy of about 3-4% in the hadronization process and the detector effects. We also found that the systematic uncertainty due to the hadronization process is comparable with the experimental uncertainty due to the detector effects. Therefore, we can conclude that the hadronization process is well understood and the hadron parameters can be reliably measured with QCD sum rules in the hadron accelerator environment."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present observations of the gas temperature in the core of the high-density dwarf irregular galaxy L 1544, obtained with the Intermediate Development of Very Long Baseline Interferometry (IDVLB) at the European Southern Observatory. We find that the gas temperature is higher in the eastern half of the core, with a value of log(T\/K) = 7.05 +0.41\/-0.11 at the peak. This is significantly higher than the value found from a previous single-dish observation, log(T\/K) = 6.80 +0.13\/-0.14. The standard deviation of the temperature in the core is 8 K. We have found no evidence of a cooling flow in L 1544, despite the fact that the core temperature is slightly higher in the eastern half. The temperature structure is consistent with a constant temperature in the core, and a single-dish observation is not sensitive enough to reveal the core structure. We have compared our data with a simple model in which the gas is treated as isothermal, with a single value of the temperature equal to the mean value in the core. The best fit to our data has a temperature of log(T\/K) = 7.00 +0.45\/-0.09. A two-temperature model with the temperatures set to the limits of the data gives a slightly better fit, with a goodness-of-fit criterion of log(RMS\/RMSobs) = 1.08, compared to 1.13 for the one-temperature model. The implications of our observations for models of gas cooling in galactic nuclei are discussed."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate the formation of trans-Neptunian binaries through the chaos-assisted capture of a victim object by a largerbinary system. We consider a model in which a low-mass asteroid is first dynamically trapped in the3:2 mean-motion resonance with Neptune, and then captured into a trans-Neptunian binary sys-tem. We find that the chaos-assisted capture is possible only for a limited range of initial conditions,and only if the victim asteroid is a binary system itself. We show that the probability of the capture is maximizedwhen the relative orbital elements of the victim and the primary are close to a Hopf bifurcation, and whenthe victim has a retrograde orbit. We derive a simple analytic expression for the time evolution of the relativeorbital elements of the binary system, which allows us to investigate the dependence of the capture prob-ability on the initial conditions in a systematic way. We find that the capture probability for a given initial conditionis small, and that the success rate is only 1% for a million years. We also find that the capture probability isinversely proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of the orbits, which implies that a large number of smallbinaries is more favorable for the capture than a small number of large binaries. We discuss theimplications of our results for the population of trans-Neptunian binaries, and for the possibility of chaos-assisted capture in the solar system."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a catalogue of 1,145 galaxies selected by their neighbours from a sample of 864 isolated galaxies in the Local Volume, drawn from the AMIGA survey. The sample is used to investigate the properties of galaxies which are members of poor groups and the effects of group membership on galaxy evolution. The catalogue is the fourth in a series of papers based on the AMIGA survey. A total of 55 groups are found containing two or more of our sample galaxies; 37 of these groups are poor. We find that poor group members are, on average, significantly less massive than galaxies in rich groups. In addition, they are more likely to be morphologically late-type galaxies and to be found in smaller groups. We find that the global group property of feedback influences the properties of group members in poor groups more than in rich groups, suggesting that feedback is more efficient in poor groups. We also find that the group member which is most influenced by its group environment is a morphologically early-type galaxy, suggesting that these galaxies are most susceptible to the group environment. Our results are consistent with a model in which group membership has a significant effect on galaxy evolution and in which poor groups are efficient star-formation feedback amplifiers."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a method to obtain spatially and temporally resolved dynamics of penumbral filaments in solar flares. We have developed a technique that utilizes the correlation between the magnetic field and the temperature to extract the p-mode dynamics in penumbral filaments. To apply this method, we have developed an automated algorithm to identify penumbral filaments in solar flares. Once the penumbral filaments are identified, we use the correlation between the magnetic field and the temperature to extract the p-mode dynamics. We have applied this method to several solar flares and found that the p-mode dynamics in penumbral filaments can be very different from one flare to another. In some flares the p-mode dynamics is very stable, while in other flares the p-mode dynamics is very chaotic. We have also found that in some flares the penumbral filaments can exhibit a different type of dynamics, which we call modified p-mode dynamics. In these cases, the period of the p-mode dynamics is much longer than the typical periods of tens of seconds. These long-period p-mode dynamics can be very stable, or they can be very chaotic. This new type of dynamics could be due to the interaction between the penumbral filaments and the surrounding magnetic field. Our results suggest that the dynamics of penumbral filaments can be very complex, and can be different in different flares.

{"text":"\nWe show that the conserved charges of certain spaces in arbitrary dimensions are related to the geometry of the spaces in a very simple and nearly optimal way. The motivation for this research is to gain further understanding of the structure of the space and the geometry within it, in order to find the most efficient and simplest description of the space and the geometry within it. Our key idea is to use the tools ofsymplectic geometry in order to find a description of the conserved charges which is independent of the dimension. The results obtained are that for arbitrary dimension, the spaces can be described by the geometry in a simple way. The problem this work attempts to solve is to find a description of the conserved charges which is as simple as possible and independent of the dimension. A practical application of this work is that we can use this description to find an efficient algorithm for the computation of the conserved charges. A theoretical application is that this description can give us further understanding of the space and the geometry within it."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a simple method, based on the generation and evaluation of an arbitrary number of clues, for obtaining a sample from a set of items that has a particular property. Our method has three steps. In the first step, we generate a number of clues. Each clue is a subset of the items in which the property is either present or absent. In the second step, we evaluate the clues by checking which subsets yield samples that are representative of the whole set. In the third step, we use the evaluation results to select a clue that yields the most representative sample. We show that our method is guaranteed to return a sample that is within a prespecified distance from the whole set, in terms of the measure of the property. Our method is motivated by the problem of sampling a set of items that has a complicated and expensive to evaluate property. We demonstrate the usefulness of our method by applying it to the problem of sampling sets of items that have a large number of different properties, for which the standard method of using a single clue is suboptimal."}
{"text":"\nWe present a new method for fitting resonant states to electroweak Precision tests of the Standard Model (SM) at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) are sensitive to the structure of states in the Very Small Black Hole (VSBH) regime. We show that a suitable choice of a natural prior for the mass of a VSBH, which depends on the mass of the lightest vector boson ( lighter than the one expected from the Higgs sector), can greatly improve the fit to the electroweak data. The method is similar to the one recently proposed by Abulencia, crossing the Higgs sector with the goal of VSBHs, and relies on the use of a proper natural prior for the mass of the new states. The main difference is that we work in the VSBH regime, and use the VSBH mass scale as the pivot point in the Prior. We find that a prior which is a power law with a positive power is particularly suitable. This is a generic result which can be applied to other resonances. We also show that if the SM is extended with a minimal supersymmetry (MSSM) the power law prior can be used to get an improved fit to the MSSM data. Finally, we present a forecast for the LHC weather in the coming years, derived using a combination of the optimal fit to the electroweak data and the MSSM mass constraints."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a new method, based on difference imaging, for finding supernovae (SNe) in galaxies in wide field-of-view (FOV) images. The method uses a small set of reference images, acquired over a narrow range of angles, to subtract the background galaxy light and detect the much fainter supernova light. We demonstrate that, for a fixed amount of work, this method can find SNe in galaxies fainter and farther away than previous methods. We find that a good choice for the reference images is a set of four images, taken at 90 degree intervals, with the angle between the reference images and the search image ranging from approximately 45 degrees to 135 degrees. We show that difference images with a signal-to-noise ratio of unity can be achieved with a reference image exposure time of approximately three times the exposure time of the search image. We have developed a software package, Difference Image Finder, that uses this method to search a set of nearly 10,000 wide FOV images of galaxies, taken with the Advanced Camera for Surveys, for SNe. We have found 3,isma and 1,29 ama SNe in our first round of analysis, with the software automatically extracting the information necessary to locate these SNe in the original images.

{"text":"\nElectron doping of cuprates via interfaces with manganites is an attractive route to engineer the electronic structure of cuprate superconductors. We have synthesized and characterized a series of multilayered heterostructures consisting of a cuprate and a manganite layer, and determined the electronic and structural properties of the interfacial regions. Our results show that the electronic and structural properties of the heterostructures can be tailored by tuning the thickness of the manganite layer and the subsequent heat treatment. In particular, we find that a two-layer heterostructure with a 3:1 cuprate\/manganite thickness ratio and a heat treatment at 150 \u00b0C for 5 hours is optimal for electron doping of the cuprate layer, resulting in a superconductor with a Tc greater than 100 K and a critical current density greater than 1 kA cm\u22122. We also find that the electron-doped cuprate layer is sensitive to the presence of an external magnetic field, as reflected by the fact that the magnetic field dependence of the superconducting transition temperature and the critical current density follows the well-known 123-eV-cm2 dependence. Our results suggest that the multilayered heterostructures are promising for developing cuprate superconductors with high Tc and high critical current density, and for studying the interplay between superconductivity and magnetism."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider a space-time percolation process on a lattice, in which the evolution of a site is governed by the local update rule proposed by Edelsbrunner and Gel'fand: the site changes state only if all its neighbors are in the same state. We show that this process is critical in all dimensions greater than or equal to three, and derive an explicit expression for the probability that a site is in the critical state. In two dimensions, we show that the percolation process is mean-field critical and derive an expression for the probability that a site is in the critical state, which, in the case of a large system size, has a simple intuitive meaning. We also show that the critical state is resilient against changes in the update rule: a slight modification of the update rule, in which the order in which the neighbors are checked is changed, can lead to a different critical state. However, for large system sizes, this different critical state is obtained by first percolating in space and then percolating in time, which suggests that the critical state is robust against changes in the update rule and has a simple intuitive meaning."}

A series of laboratory experiments were conducted on loose sand and compact clay, and the results show that the proposed method is capable of measuring the soil bulk density with an accuracy of 1.5% and 2.3% for loose sand and compact clay, respectively, without the need for soil sample drying and weighing in the laboratory. The proposed method has the potential to be developed into a rapid and cost-effective in-situ soil bulk density testing method, which could be used for quality control and verification of soil properties in geotechnical engineering projects."}

{"text":"\nWe present a model of black hole accretion in low states, where the ion temperature is below the electron temperature. In such states, the accretion process is governed by the temperature difference between the two species. The model includes a correction due to the ambipolar coupling between electrons and ions, which is shown to be significant in low states. The main result of this work is a criterion for the transition between the low and high states, as a function of the black hole mass and the accretion rate. We show that this criterion is in good agreement with the observations of low state accretion in the GRS 1900+14 and PSBT 0411-143 black holes, and also predicts a slow transition between the low and high states for black holes with accretion rates close to the boundary between the two states.\n\nWe also derive a simple expression for the ion temperature in the low states, as a function of the black hole mass and accretion rate. We discuss the possibility of measuring the ion temperature in low states, and show that the ion temperature has a large dependence on the viewing angle. We also point out that in low states the ion temperature is not a well-defined quantity, due to the ambipolar coupling between the electrons and the ions. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results for the accretion process in low states, and for the physical properties of the accretion disc in these states."}
{"text":"\nWe present a detailed study of the dependence of the local reionization history on halo mass and environment, using a new algorithm based on the marched-out distribution of the cosmic microwave background. We find that the shape of the local reionization history is significantly different in different environments, despite having the same average level. In particular, we find that the local group is likely to have been reionized by the nearby Virgo cluster, even if the local group had a massive dark matter halo. We show this by comparing the local reionization history with the theoretical prediction of the contribution from a massive dark matter halo, which was derived from a large numerical simulation. We also show that the local reionization history is consistent with the assumption that the local group has a low mass dark matter halo and was reionized by the intergalactic medium. Therefore, we can exclude a massive local dark matter halo as a necessary condition for the local group to be reionized by a massive nearby cluster, like Virgo. We also show that a massive dark matter halo in the local group can be consistently explained by a low mass dark matter halo, if the local group was reionized by the intergalactic medium."}
{"text":"\nWe present a combined analysis of three-dimensional weak lensing, the Lyman-alpha forest, and WMAP year three data. We show that the three data sets are consistent with the standard LCDM model with \\Lambda_{CDM} = 1.9 \\times 10^{-5} h Mpc^{-1} (68% confidence interval), which is very close to the critical density needed to stop the expansion of the Universe and obtain a flat Universe. We find that the Universe is slightly better described by a model in which the galaxies are homogeneously distributed in the voids than by a model in which the voids are filled with a background galaxies. We discuss this finding in the context of the overdensity of galaxies in voids observed in galaxy redshift surveys. We show that the probability distribution of the lensing magnitude variance is in good agreement with the prediction of the standard LCDM model, and that the lensing magnitude variance is consistent with a power law probability distribution with a power law index of -1.91 (68% confidence interval). We show that the mean density of the Universe, as inferred from the weak lensing data set, is slightly higher than the mean density inferred from the WMAP year three data set. We conclude that the current data sets do not strongly favour a model with a spatially dependent \\Lambda_{CDM} (such as the model with a Einstein-de Sitter group with a scale dependent cosmological constant) over the standard LCDM model."}
{"text":"\nWe present predictions, derived from simple models, for the molecular line emission from massive protostellar disks. We consider the impact of various physical ingredients, such as the disk temperature, the fraction of gas that is CO, the grain surface chemistry, and the relative spatial distribution of the grain and gas regions. We show that a simple recipe for computing the molecular line luminosity can be derived from first principles, and we use this recipe to derive the molecular line luminosity function in a parameter space that is relevant for the ALMA Band 4 and Band 5. We also consider the case of a disk with a given temperature and gas-to-grain ratio, and we derive the molecular line luminosity function as a function of the fraction of gas that is CO. We show that this function has a minimum, which is reached for a gas mixture that is approximately one-half CO and one-half H2. We also derive a simple expression for the molecular line luminosity function for an optically thick disk, and we use this expression to derive the molecular line luminosity function for a subset of the disks in our parameter space. We compare our predictions with observations of massive protostellar disks, and we conclude that observations of the CO J=1-0 and J=2-1 lines with ALMA will be able to discriminate between disks with different physical ingredients. We also discuss observations of the CO J=3-2 line with the EVLA, and we derive a recipe for computing the EVLA sensitivity to disks with different physical ingredients.

{"text":"\n\nWe present radio spectral energy distributions for 38 broad absorption line (BAL) quasars in the 1.4 < z < 2.2 interval, drawn from a larger sample of 44 quasars. The quasars in our sample have rest frame 6.2 < log(O\/H) < 7.2,log(O2\/H2) < 1.5, and do not show strong evidence of dust obscuration. We present the radio intensity as a function of frequency and compare the radio spectral energy distribution (R-SED) for quasars with strong and weak BALs. We find that the shape of the R-SED depends sensitively on the strength of the BAL. The R-SEDs for quasars with strong BALs resemble those of broad absorption line galaxies (BALGs), displaying a power law with a break at a frequency that depends on the quasar redshift and optical luminosity. In contrast, the R-SEDs for quasars with weak BALs have a different shape, with a break at a higher frequency. We discuss two possible physical mechanisms that could produce these different R-SED shapes. The R-SEDs for both strong and weak BAL quasars are well described by a single power law with a break at a frequency fbreak = (1.2 \u00b1 1.3) GHz, which is independent of the strength of the BAL, the quasar redshift, or the optical luminosity. The R-SEDs for all quasars in our sample, including those with the weakest BALs, have a common shape with a break at fbreak, suggesting that this shape may be universal for quasars with oxygen abundances characteristic of galactic starbursts. This has implications for models of radio emission from galactic objects, where the break frequency is typically assumed to be universal and determined only by the proton temperature."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a study of the relativistic X-ray lines from the inner accretion disks around black holes. We compute the mass and temperature structure of the disks with the help of three-dimensional general relativistic hydrodynamics, and we use this information to calculate the relevant spectral parameters such as temperature, density, and line center energy. We investigate the influence of the disk structure on the line features, in particular, the Knoll angle and the line energy shift as a function of the line wavelength. We also discuss the disk reionization and the transition from a neutral to an ionized medium, which has important implications for the spectral features of the disk. We find that the lines are blue-shifted and that their energy distribution is well described by a power law. We also show that a simple model, in which the reionization is assumed to be produced by a spherical inner ionization source of known size, provides a good description of our numerical results. The Knoll angle is found to be relatively large and sensitive to the disk structure, in particular, to the radial density profile. We discuss our results in the framework of the general theory of X-ray lines from accretion disks around black holes, and we analyze the implications of our findings for the interpretation of observations of X-ray lines from accreting black holes."}
{"text":"\n\nWe have carried out a systematic study of the fundamental parameters of both He-weak and He-strong stars. Our aim has been to identify and study the different evolutionary channels of these stars, in particular the transition between the main sequence and the first evolved phase, as well as to determine the main physical properties of the various types of these stars. We have found that a correlation exists between the fundamental parameters of these stars, in particular between the stellar mass and the helium abundance. Our results also suggest that a direct measurement of the helium abundance is not possible without an accurate knowledge of the effective temperature and the stellar mass. As an application of our method we have derived an empirical relation between the helium abundance and the other fundamental parameters. We have also found that the fundamental parameters of these stars are well described by a simple stellar model in which the evolution of the star is driven by its own radiative properties and that of a simple geometric model in which the expansion of the star is described by a perfect gas equation."}

{"text":"\nWe investigate the problem of characterizing the solar interior by means of an equation of state (EOS) that relates the pressure to the temperature and density, P=f(T,r), in a suitable inner-shell approximation. The aim of the work is twofold: on the one hand, to assess the validity of the approximation and, on the other hand, to explore the possibility of extracting information on the solar interior structure from the study of the mathematical properties of the EOS. To this end, we consider an EOS that has been recently proposed, based on the Path-Integral Formalism, which has proven to be very successful in the study of the solar photosphere. Our results show that the proposed EOS provides a good description of the solar interior close to the sun's surface. We find that the maximum allowed value for the thermal convection is $\\sim 30\\%$, in agreement with the value obtained by other methods. A simple analysis of the EOS shows that the approximation is not valid in the core, where the pressure is much higher than the yield strength of the matter. However, this conclusion can be confirmed by an analytical study of the Solutions of the EOS. We also find that the EOS does not admit a proper Slowly Varying Approximation (SVA), unless the thermal convection is very weak. The main implication of our results is that any attempt to study the structure of the solar interior by means of an EOS in the inner-shell approximation is likely to be unsuccessful. However, this approximation can be very useful to study the structure and evolution of the outer shell, where the solar convection is the dominant physical process."}
{"text":"\n\nFree zero-range processes on networks\n\nWe study the statistical properties of free zero-range processes on random networks. A free zero-range process is a continuous-time random walk on a graph, where the graph is assumed to be a random geometric structure and the walk moves from vertex to vertex with probability independent of the graph. We show that the limiting behavior of the random walk depends on the underlying random geometric structure and is well described by a simple functional equation. In particular, we show that the limiting distribution of the random walk is a function of the number of steps and the probability of transiting to a vertex adjacent to the current vertex. We obtain a rigorous proof of this functional equation and show that it is consistent with the functional form of the limiting distribution. This analysis allows us to understand the connection between the underlying geometric structure and the statistical properties of the random walk. In particular, we show that the random walk is equally likely to be found at any vertex and that the number of visits to a given vertex follows a Poisson distribution. We also show that the distribution of the number of steps between visits to a given vertex follows an exponential distribution."}

We consider the effect of the transverse size of the graphene nanoribbons on the electronic transport properties of the MOSFETs in the ballistic regime. Our simulation results show a clear and systematic change in the electronic transport properties in response to the transverse size of the graphene nanoribbons. In particular, we find that the ballistic transport regime can be significantly extended by reducing the transverse size of the graphene nanoribbons, and that a unique sub-ballistic transport regime, which cannot be achieved in conventional MOSFETs, can be achieved by further reducing the transverse size of the graphene nanoribbons. We also find that the sub-ballistic transport regime can be probed by adjusting the gate voltage, and that the ballistic and sub-ballistic transport regimes can be seamlessly and simultaneously achieved in the same device by tuning the transverse size of the graphene nanoribbons and the gate voltage. Our findings provide a clear and systematic design guideline for the future development of ballistic graphene nanoribbon MOSFETs."}
{"text":"\n\nDynamic compressions are motions in the atmosphere that are both fast and intense enough to disrupt the local thermodynamic equilibrium, and are therefore capable of modifying the distribution of clouds. A number of cloud microstructure processes have been proposed to explain how clouds respond to dynamic compressions, but the most plausible mechanisms remain debated. Here we show, using large-eddy simulation, that the growth and subsequent collapse of quiescent cloud cores is a robust feature of dynamic compressions in a stratified boundary layer. We observe the growth of cloud cores in response to an increase in the rate of compression, and their subsequent collapse due to a reduction of the rate of compression or to an extreme event that disrupts the cloud core. We describe the physical processes that are most plausible to explain the formation and collapse of these cloud cores, and we quantify their importance by comparing different parameterizations in a cloud microphysical model. We find that thecollapseofcloudcoresintothediskisbestdescribedbymainlybyahydrophilicbrain.\ncloud core is associated with an increase in the cloud liquid water content and cloud base mass flux, and a decrease in the cloud fraction. The sensitivity of the model to the different parameterizations suggests that different physical processes are important for the formation and the collapse of cloud cores. We also find that the parameterization of the cloud microphysical model has a strong influence on the model's ability to reproduce the large-eddy simulation results, indicating that the representation of cloud microphysical processes is important for the prediction of weather and climate."}
{"text":"\nWe have developed a novel, versatile, and cost-effective strategy for the synthesis of self-organized Ge(1-x)Mn(x) nano-columns with a unique coaxial magnetic and structural anisotropy. The nano-columns are formed by a room-temperature reaction of Ge(1-x)Mn(x) nanowires and a co-evaporation process. The resulting nano-columns have a double-layered core-shell structure with a soft magnetic Mn75Ge25 core and a hard magnetic Ge shell. The resulting coaxial anisotropy, i.e. the structural anisotropy of the hard magnetic shell and the magnetic anisotropy of the soft magnetic core, endows the nano-columns with a strong room-temperature magnetocaloric effect along the easy magnetization direction, a significant coercive force along the hard magnetic direction, and a high remanence. Our work paves the way for the design and synthesis of nano-structured magnetic materials with unique and enhanced properties by combining different types of nano-building blocks with distinct magnetic, electrical, optical, and structural properties."}
{"text":"\n\nWe study the masses of mesons as a function of the amount of seniority using the domain-wall fermion (DWF) approach. We show that the mass relations in the quark model (QM) can be recovered in the limit of large seniority, where the quark and antiquark contributions to the meson mass are comparable. The main new feature in the DWF approach is that, in addition to the quark and antiquark contributions, there is a finite non-perturbative term in the meson mass. We show that this non-perturbative term is small for light mesons but becomes comparable to the quark and antiquark terms for heavy mesons. As a result, the mass relations for heavy mesons are different from the QM mass relations. We evaluate the meson masses for several realistic DWF parameter sets and find that the predictions of the DWF approach are consistent with the current quark model parametrizations. One exception is the mass of the Strange quark which is larger in the DWF approach. We explain this exception by the fact that the Strange quark is particularly light and therefore is more sensitive to the non-perturbative terms. We also discuss the relation between the DWF and QM approaches to meson masses and find that the two approaches are not fully equivalent. Finally, we show that the DWF approach can be used to study the meson mass singularity and to understand the mechanism of its softening."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present here results of a systematic numerical study of the interplay between the dynamics of radio galaxies and the cluster environment. We find that the cluster potential can significantly alter the distribution of radio galaxies in the cluster, in particular in the outskirts where the influence of the cluster is the strongest. We also find that a lack of cluster influence on radio galaxies, as is the case in the Local Group, results in a flatter radio galaxy distribution. Our results suggest that in clusters with a steep radio galaxy distribution, the cluster environment has a strong influence on the radio galaxies, while in clusters with a flat distribution the cluster environment has little influence. We also discuss a possible connection between the distribution of radio galaxies in clusters and the cluster mass distribution. Our results are consistent with a picture where the dynamics of radio galaxies is influenced by the cluster environment, in particular by the distribution of mass in the cluster, but also by other cluster properties, such as the strength of the radio source."}
{"text":"\nLayered sine-Gordon (LSG) models are generalized to include a term describing the evolution of a weak non-linear singularity along the direction of the applied field. Two different approaches are followed in the analysis of the new models. The first one is based on the Hamiltonian approach and on the small parameter method, in the framework of the Ginzburg-Landau model. The second one is based on the use of the Green function method, within the framework of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless model. In both cases the basic and the singular terms of the evolution operator are found and their behavior is investigated for different values of a coupling parameter, which describes the strength of the singularity. We show that the additional term in the evolution operator has a strong effect on the dynamics of the system, leading in particular to a full destruction of the perfect balance between the basic and the singular terms, which is usually observed in the case of a strong non-linearity. In the case of a small coupling the additional term gives rise to a long-living weak singularity, whose evolution is completely determined by the basic term. When the coupling increases the singularity becomes more and more prominent, until it leads to a jump of the ground state at a critical value of the coupling. We also found a special case, in which the ground state has a small but non-zero condensate, for which the additional term has a very strong effect on the dynamics of the system, leading to a fast evolution of the condensate towards the vacuum value."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate the nonlocal excitation spectra in one- and two-dimensional (1D and 2D) doped Hubbard models, which are extensively used to describe unconventional superconductors and thermoelectric materials, respectively. In both cases, we consider the model in the thermodynamic limit, i.e., for an infinite system size, and in the limit of a weak coupling to the thermal reservoir. In 1D, we use an exact diagonalization method and find the temperature dependence of the excitation spectrum, the thermodynamic limit of the thermoelectric figure of merit, and the dependence on the doping level. In 2D, we use a numerical renormalization group technique and find the existence of a Fano factor in the spectrum, whose sign depends on the doping level and the thermal fluctuations. We also find the temperature and size dependence of the spectrum and the thermodynamic limit of the thermoelectric figure of merit. Our results in both cases are consistent with the existence of a finite-size effect, which influences the low-temperature properties of the spectrum and the thermoelectric figure of merit."}
{"text":"\nWe have developed a new method for estimating the size of the broad-line region (BLR) in active galactic nuclei (AGN) based on measurements of the correlation function of the nuclear optical emission. Our method is independent of any model for the detailed geometry of the BLR, and it does not require knowledge of the distances to the source or to the BLR boundaries. We show that our method is very sensitive to the absolute scale of the BLR, and we use it to constrain models in which the BLR is either a uniform cylinder or a tapered cone. We show that if the cylinder is oriented along the line of sight, as assumed in the standard model, the BLR must be very large, with a length of 1-2 optically-friendly units. This is inconsistent with observations of the nearby Universe, unless the gas density in the BLR is very low. We consider an alternative model in which the BLR is a tapered cone. In this model the size of the BLR depends on the angle \u03b8 between the line of sight and the cone's axis, so that the BLR is small (for example, with a length of 1-2 optically-friendly units) when \u03b8 is small, and it is large when \u03b8 is large. We show that this model can produce a good fit to observations of the BLR's size as a function of optical depth, if the angle \u03b8 is relatively small. We also show that if the tapered-cone model is correct, there must be a correlation between the size of the BLR and the mass of the central engine, with the mass being proportional to the square of the size. This correlation is consistent with observations of the mass and size of the BLR in nearby galaxies."}

As an application, we give a description of the affine subspace of a certain class of tracial classes in terms of finite-dimensional algebras over the integers."}
{"text":"\n\nWe are motivated by the problem of identifying co-occurring maximal frequent patterns in a stream of transactions. This problem is a core problem in data mining and has been addressed using either a query-based approach or an index-based approach. In the query-based approach, the patterns are found by iteratively querying for the most frequent elements and then extending these to larger patterns. The index-based approach, on the other hand, pre-processes the transactions to create an index of the most frequent elements and then uses the index to find the co-occurring maximal frequent patterns. In this paper, we propose a new index-based approach that is based on maintaining several indexes, where each index is for a different value of the minimum support. We show that our index-based approach is more efficient than the query-based approach. We also propose an online algorithm that uses the index-based approach to identify the co-occurring maximal frequent patterns in a stream of transactions. Our experimental results show that our online algorithm is more efficient than the query-based approach."}
{"text":"\n\nWe compare the magnetic flux distribution between a coronal hole and a quiet region using the satellite data of the Solar Optical Telescope (SOT) on board the Hinode spacecraft. We find that the area with high magnetic flux concentration (MFC) is larger in the coronal hole than in the quiet region. In addition, the magnetic flux density (MFD) in the high MFC area is higher in the coronal hole than in the quiet region. The results suggest that the difference in the magnetic flux distribution between the coronal hole and the quiet region is due to the difference in the magnetic flux concentration, which is caused by the difference in the flare activity. We also find that the size of the high MFC area is correlated with the length of the longest magnetic flux line, and that the MFD in the high MFC area is correlated with the average magnetic flux density in the area with low magnetic flux concentration. These correlations suggest that the distribution of the magnetic flux in the corona is controlled by the large-scale structure of the magnetic field.\n\nThis work is supported by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) through the Hinode Project."}
{"text":"\n\nWe introduce a novel approach to clustering with respect to graph patterns. Our approach is based on a generalization of the well-known Knill-Laflamme conditions in order to define a notion of a solution to a system of equations describing the behavior of the graph pattern clustering problem. We show that this solution is equivalent to minimizing the number of non-intervening vertices in a particular associated graph, and we design an efficient algorithm to minimize this number. Our approach has several advantages. First, our method is guaranteed to find a solution to the system of equations, and is therefore applicable in general situations. Second, the number of non-intervening vertices is a natural and simple measure of the quality of the clustering. Third, the algorithm is simple, and is guaranteed to find the globally optimal solution to the problem. We analyze the worst-case and average-case complexity of our algorithm, and show that it is efficient in practice. We illustrate our approach by applying it to several examples."}
{"text":"\nWe reply to the comment of Belcastro et al. on our paper \"Essence of intrinsic tunnelling: Distinguishing intrinsic features from artefacts\". We emphasize that our main result is the extraction of a robust intrinsic permeability from a large amount of experimental data, which had not been possible before. We show that our result is in good agreement with the theoretical predictions of an ideal random walk in an infinite chain. The result of Belcastro et al. on the other hand, obtained by an assumption of a modified random walk with a non-zero probability of staying in the current site, is in disagreement with our result, but in agreement with the result of Hales et al. We explain that the disagreement is due to the fact that the assumption of a modified random walk is not justified, as the assumption of an ideal random walk is. We also point out that our result is consistent with a strict random walk if the barrier crossing probability is increased compared to the assumption made in the original paper."}
{"text":"\nWe consider a symmetric exclusion process with two components and open boundaries. We show a transition from a state with one global exclusion to a state with multiple exclusions, which can be viewed as a phase transition from a product to a disjoint sum. The motivation for this work is to understand the effects of non-Markovian dynamics on the statistical properties of the symmetric exclusion process. The key ideas and methodology are to use the rigorous formulation of the symmetric exclusion process with open boundaries and the associated rigorous relationships between different measures of the process. The results obtained are the construction of a necessary and sufficient condition for a phase transition to a state with multiple exclusions, and the derivation of a simple expression for the stationary distribution of the process in this state. The problem this work attempts to solve is to understand the effects of non-Markovian dynamics on the symmetric exclusion process. The practical application of this work is in understanding the behavior of the symmetric exclusion process in the presence of non-Markovian dynamics, which can be important in various applications such as mobile communications and computer networks. The theoretical application of this work is in the understanding of the effects of non-Markovian dynamics on the statistical properties of random processes."}
{"text":"\nWe propose a physically sound Hamiltonian formulation of the dynamical Casimir effect that enables a systematic treatment of the problem in the presence of a dielectric function that is not yet permittive for the vacuum field but is capable of supporting a certain type of charged particle field. In this picture, the vacuum expectation value of the dynamical Casimir effect is identified with the ground state of a Hamiltonian system that consists of a conventional time-varying dipole moment source and a complex dielectric function that is permitted to carry a certain type of charged particle field in addition to the vacuum field. The method is applied to a simple example in which the real part of the dielectric function is allowed to carry a charged particle field in addition to the vacuum field. The results obtained are consistent with the earlier formulation of the problem in the framework of the Maxwell-Chern-Weil theory, but our formulation has the advantage that it is more general and more physical in the sense that it does not require an ad-hoc modification of the Maxwell-Chern-Weil formulation in order to take into account the non-permittivity of the real part of the dielectric function."}
{"text":"\nWe present an analysis of the evolution and temperature structure of a coronal hole over three solar rotations.

The average temperature in the photosphere is about 5000 K, but in the temperature minimum region, the temperature is only about 1000 K. We find that the evolution of the magnetic field is very different in the high-temperature region and the low-temperature region. In the high-temperature region, the magnetic field is open, and the field lines are mostly radial. In the low-temperature region, the magnetic field is closed and the field lines are mostly spiral. We also find that the magnetic field in the low-temperature region is more stable than the magnetic field in the high-temperature region. We explain this behavior by considering the relationship between the temperature and the magnetic field. In particular, we consider the effect of temperature on the magnetic flux. We find that the magnetic flux is proportional to the temperature to the power of 2\/3. This means that the magnetic field is more stable in the low-temperature region, because the change of magnetic flux in this region is smaller than the change of magnetic flux in the high-temperature region."}
{"text":"\n\nNodeTrix: Hybrid Representation for Analyzing Social Networks\n\nWe present a new method for analyzing social networks that combines the advantages of two complementary representations: the node-link representation and the spectral representation. The node-link representation is well-suited for tasks such as node classification, community detection, and shortest path, but is not well-suited for analysis of large networks due to the quadratic storage and update complexity. The spectral representation is well-suited for analysis of large networks, but cannot be used for tasks such as node classification and community detection. We present a new representation, called the NodeTrix representation, that combines the best of both worlds. The NodeTrix representation is based on a combination of the node-link and spectral representations, and has a variety of useful properties that are not shared by either representation alone. We show that the NodeTrix representation can be used to effectively analyze social networks, and we present a series of experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets."}
{"text":"\n\n2D ANNNI (Anisotropic Nonlinear Neural Network) is a recently proposed effective deep learning model for image classification. It is based on the ANNNI model, which is a kind of DNN that uses the kernel function to map the input to a high-dimensional nonlinear space. 2D ANNNI is composed of two ANNNI layers with different kernel functions and parameters. The first one is used to map the input to a nonlinear space, and the second one is used to nonlinearly discriminate the data in this space. Since the parameters of 2D ANNNI are not learned from the data, a floating phase is introduced to optimize the model. In this paper, we first prove that 2D ANNNI is a generalization of ANNNI, and then propose a convergence analysis of 2D ANNNI with the floating phase. The convergence analysis is based on the analysis of the pursuation of the direction of the search in the floating phase. The proposed convergence analysis shows that the floating phase can be avoided by using a block method, and the learned parameters are equivalent to those by using the floating phase. The proposed block method is further validated by an extensive set of simulations."}
{"text":"\n\nRecursive neural networks (RNNs) have recently become a popular tool for time series prediction, both for practical applications and as a benchmark for more exotic methods. We show that, in addition to prediction, RNNs are suitable for a variety of related tasks, such as risk assessment. In fact, the popular long short-term memory (LSTM) network is well-suited for risk assessment, provided that the network is appropriately initialized and that the prediction is conditioned on a finite set of explanatory variables. To highlight the versatility of the approach, we consider a variety of risk assessment tasks, such as quantile regression, value-at-risk estimation, and unconditional risk assessment. We show that a single model can be used to perform all of these tasks, and that the model is flexible enough to be applied to a variety of datasets. We also present a new risk assessment task, which we call informed risk assessment, and show that the RNN-based approach is capable of solving it."}

{"text":"\n\nWe investigate the origin of the major solar event that occurred on 2006 December 13, which was probably the most intense solar flare and coronal mass ejection (CME) during the past several decades. The motivation for this work is to understand the physical mechanism that can produce such a large solar event. Our main results can be summarized as follows. (1) A large and fast rotating sunspot was the main source of energy for the solar event. (2) Ephemeral regions, which are usually associated with solar flares and CMEs, enhanced the energy output from the sunspot and caused the major solar event. (3) We propose that the interaction between a fast rotating sunspot and ephemeral regions is a possible physical mechanism to produce very large solar events. (4) We found that most of the large solar events in solar cycle 24 have been produced in a similar way. (5) Our results suggest that the physical mechanism that produces solar events is dependent on the solar cycle.\n\nWe used data from the Solar Optical Telescope (SOT) on board the Hinode spacecraft, the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), and the Solar Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO).

{"text":"\n\nPrivacy - an Issue for eLearning? A Trend Analysis Reflecting the Attitude of European eLearning Users.\n\nThe continuous development of information and communication technology (ICT) has changed the way we communicate, work, and learn. Especially the possibilities offered by the internet and the World Wide Web (WWW) have triggered a tremendous interest in eLearning, with millions of users worldwide. At the same time, concerns about privacy have been raised, as the collection and use of personal data on the internet and the WWW have increased. This work presents a trend analysis of the attitude of European eLearning users towards privacy. The analysis is based on 473 responses to an online survey, which was conducted within the EU-funded PICE (Privacy in e-Learning) project. Results show that users have quite a positive attitude towards privacy. However, they do not feel sufficiently informed about the way their personal data are used in eLearning. They would like to have more control over the data they provide, and they are rather critical towards the current practice of using marketing techniques to collect personal data. The results have important implications for the design of privacy-sensitive eLearning systems."}
{"text":"\nWe study finite temperature corrections to the leading noncommutative contributions to the effective action for a class of D-branes in noncommutative geometry. We find that the leading noncommutative correction can be generated by a change of variables which is a finite temperature correction to the original variables. We then consider the noncommutative effective action for D-branes at singularities and show that the effective action for the noncommutative geometry can be obtained as a finite temperature correction to the effective action for the standard geometry. This provides a geometrically intrinsic way to generate the noncommutative effective action from the standard effective action. We then consider the noncommutative effective action for the standard model with neutrino mixing and find that the noncommutative model can be obtained by a finite temperature correction to the standard model with neutrino mixing. We show that this correction is induced by an internal symmetry of the standard model with neutrino mixing. We consider the problem of constructing a manifestly noncommutative theory from a commutative theory and find that this is in general not possible. However, we show that a theory with an internal symmetry can be constructed from a theory without internal symmetry by a finite temperature correction which induces the internal symmetry."}
{"text":"\nWe study the effects of the anomaly on the two-flavor QCD chiral phase transition. We consider a general definition of the chiral transition temperature, and evaluate the conditions for the anomaly to have a significant effect on the transition. We show that the anomaly can delay the transition, and can even lead to a transition to a phase where the fermionic generators are not balanced. The conditions for this to occur are rather general, and in particular do not require a particular form for the potential between the two fermionic generators. We also derive a general criterion for the transition temperature to be sensitive to the anomaly. We then study the particular case of a point-coupling potential, and evaluate the conditions for a transition temperature to exist in this case. We show that these conditions are rather general, and in particular do not require the anomaly to be large. We finally study the effect of a small anomaly on the thermodynamic properties of the chiral transitions, and in particular on the order parameter and on the critical temperature. We show that small anomalies can have a significant effect on these quantities, even when they do not delay the transition."}

{"text":"\n\nWe present photometric and spectroscopic observations of 13 globular clusters in the S0 galaxy NGC 3pager 2ter, which suggests that the globular clusters in S0 galaxies are different from those in later-type galaxies. The clusters in NGC 3pager 2ter have a much larger number of blue (i.e. metal-poor) stars. We show this in a color-magnitude diagram, where the clusters in NGC 3pager 2ter tend to lie below the 'solar metallicity' line. The cluster ages are derived from the main sequence turn-off point, and show a large spread, which is typical for clusters in S0 galaxies. We find no correlation between cluster metallicity and age. This supports the hypothesis that the clusters in S0 galaxies were formed by several population of stars, instead of one single population, as is the case in Galactic globular clusters. Our results also show that a large fraction of the clusters in S0 galaxies contain a substantial number of blue stragglers. We discuss this in the context of a possible method of estimating the cluster's metallic content, by counting the number of blue stragglers in the cluster."}
{"text":"\nWe present a photoionization model for the soft X-ray spectrum of NGC 4151. This model successfully describes the observed X-ray data, including the non-equilibration of the ionization structure on the largest scales. The ionization structure is well described by a log-normal profile with a scale length of 6.3 kpc. We show that this scale length is in agreement with the scale length of the dust distribution. The ionization structure is less well described by a gaussian profile, which is in agreement with the observations. We discuss the possible causes of this non-equilibration, and show that the most likely explanation is a shock-ionization model in which the ionization structure is driven by large-scale injections of energy. This model can also explain the presence of a soft X-ray background in the form of a power law. We show that this power law is in agreement with a model in which the power law is caused by small-scale structure (on the order of the galaxies in the cluster) that is not well described by the log-normal profile. We discuss the possibility that the non-equilibration might be caused by a lack of pressure equilibrium in the gas, possibly due to the fact that the gas is both radiative and collisional. We also discuss the effects of the large-scale structure on the small-scale structure."}
{"text":"\n\nWe investigate the mechanism of bond formation in a class of adhesive interactions between semiflexible spheres with long-ranged repulsion, using a combination of numerical simulations and Mode Coupling Theory.

We also show that the slow dynamics of bond formation is affected by a crossover as the density is increased, in spite of the fact that the corresponding static problem has no such critical behavior. Our results suggest that slow dynamics of bond formation is affected by a finite static percolation threshold, in qualitative agreement with the theoretical prediction of Mode Coupling Theory, but also by a finite dynamic percolation threshold, which is consistent with a picture where, below a critical density, the bonds have a finite lifetime and the system is in an indefinitely dynamic equilibrium, and, above the critical density, the bonds are permanent and the system is in a static equilibrium."}
{"text":"\nWe present a detailed study of the stellar content of the W3 giant molecular cloud. Using data from the 2 Micron All Sky Survey, we have identified 84 Class 0 and Class I objects in the cloud, including 75 with confirmed Youthful stars and nine with pre-main sequence objects. We have estimated the ages of these stars using isochronal chronologies, and find that the vast majority are young (10-40 Myr), with a mean age of 20 Myr. We have determined the masses of these stars from infrared color-magnitude diagrams, and find that they have a total stellar mass of 2.2 x 10^5 solar masses. This represents 1.7% of the total stellar mass of the Galaxy, and is roughly consistent with the \"Superstar Population\" hypothesis that giant molecular clouds can produce a large number of massive stars. We have compared the properties of the W3 cloud to those of the Orion Nebula Cluster, and find that they are broadly similar, suggesting that the W3 cloud may be a distant analogue of the Orion Nebula Cluster. We have identified two small clusters in the cloud, and find that they have a similar properties to young clusters in the solar neighborhood. We discuss the evolutionary status of the cloud, and find that it is still somewhat uncertain, although there are some hints that the cloud may be evolving toward a cluster-like structure."}

We propose a general and systematic spectral method for the problem and show that it is applicable to a wide class of exterior and interior elliptic problems.\n\nThe method consists of two steps. In the first step, we solve the Dirichlet problem for the elliptic PDE on the exterior of the domain with the help of a spectral technique, and in the second step, we solve the elliptic PDE on the interior of the domain with the help of the solution of the Dirichlet problem and the boundary conditions on the interior of the domain.\n\nWe show that the proposed method is applicable to a wide class of exterior and interior elliptic problems.

{"text":"\nWe show that there exists a non-trivial class of intersecting D6-branes on the Z_6' orientifold that is almost the supersymmetric Standard Model. The motivation for this work is the following observation: In the minimal supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model, the three generations of fermions are related by the non-trivial braid group symmetry. We can view this as the result of a particular choice of branes in a\ufffd-theory. We show that a choice of D6-branes on the Z_6' orientifold results in a class of models with the same fermionic structure as the minimal supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model. The key idea is to use the (non-existing) theory of D6-branes on Z_6' as a starting point, and show that the choice of D6-branes corresponding to the Standard Model must intersect in a certain way. The methodology is to work with the induced representations on the space of harmonic functions on the sphere, and show that the restriction to the plane gives rise to the Standard Model. We show that such a choice of branes exists by describing the constraints it must satisfy, and then showing that these constraints can be satisfied by a class of non-trivial choices of branes. We also show that this class of models has a natural extension to the full supersymmetric Standard Model by including the three generations of neutrinos. We also discuss the possibility of further extending this class of models to incorporate higher generations of fermions."}

{"text":"\nWe present electronic structure calculations for the interface of alkanethiolate self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) on Ag(111). We find that the alkyl chains of the SAMs prefer a parallel orientation to the surface, and that the terminal thiolate group binds to the silver surface by a disulfide (S\u2014S) bond, in addition to the non-bonding van der Waals (vdW) interactions. We show that the formation of a disulfide bond is preferred over the formation of an oxygenated (O\u2014Ag) bond, which has been suggested to be the primary binding mechanism in some previous calculations. The results are consistent with previous scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) studies, which have suggested a disulfide bonding mechanism. To investigate the effect of the alkanethiolate chain length on the electronic structure, we have calculated the structural and electronic properties for SAMs with alkyl chain lengths ranging from 4 to 18 carbons. We find that the relative binding strength of the thiolate group to the silver surface decreases with increasing alkyl chain length, which is consistent with the STM studies. We also show that the electronic properties of the interface are sensitive to the functionalization of the alkyl chain, and that the electronic properties can be tuned by chemical means to alter the electronic structure. The results suggest that the interface of alkanethiolate SAMs on Ag(111) is characterized by a strong vdW interaction and a weak S\u2014S bonding interaction, and that the electronic structure can be altered by chemical means to tune the electronic properties of the interface."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate the nanoscale structure and dynamics of solid-on-solid interfaces driven by a combination of an electric field and a mechanical strain, using molecular dynamics simulations in the framework of the waitress model. The applied electric field is found to be efficiently concentrated at the solid-on-solid interface, in a way that is different for each of the three distinct phases that the system can be in: the contact phase, the reticular phase, and the so-called Lupas phase. In the contact phase, the electric field is concentrated in a single plane at the bottom of the contacts, while in the reticular and Lupas phases the field is more uniformly distributed throughout the bulk of the material. The local distribution of the electric field in these different phases has a strong effect on the subsequent dynamics of the system, especially in the early stages of the field-driven process, and determines the final nanostructure of the solid-on-solid interface. We find that the applied electric field can have a strong entropically driven dynamics, in addition to the already present thermal fluctuations. The strength of this additional contribution depends on the local distribution of the electric field, as well as on the symmetry of the nanostructure. We also analyze the influence of the applied strain on the dynamics of the system. The analysis of the relaxation pathways shows that the combination of the electric field and the strain can have a strong influence on the structural changes that the system can undergo, as well as on the kinetically allowed pathways."}

This is in contrast to the approaches that use the path integral or the gauge invariance of the relativistic limit of the standard model. Our method avoids the common misconceptions that arise in this context, such as the notions of a background-independent formulation of general relativity or a geometrically groomed standard model.\n\nOur formalism reveals that the structure of the resulting Hamiltonian system is almost the standard model, with an additional scalar field that plays the role of the metric tensor in general relativity. The metric field is a dynamical variable that enters all the non-vanishing fermionic fields'Hamiltonians as a covariate. The only exception is the Hamiltonian of the dilaton, which is a function of the dynamical variable metric only. The masses of the fermionic fields, on the other hand, are functions of the metric and the dilaton. Our main results are the following: (i) the metric field is an independent variable of the dilaton and (ii) the dilaton is an adjoint scalar field, in the sense that it is the only scalar field that can be constructed as an inner product of other fields.\n\nWe comment on the relation of our results to the idea of a geometrically groomed standard model and to the path integral approach.

{"text":"\n\nHUDF-JD2: Mid-infrared Evidence for a z~2 Luminous Infrared Galaxy\n\nWe present mid-infrared observations of the Hubble Deep Field, made with the InfraRed Camera (IRCam) on the Hubble Space Telescope, that reveal a galaxy at a redshift of ~2 that is 2-3 times more luminous in the mid-infrared than the next most luminous object in the field. This source, which we dub HUDF-JD2, is unresolved in these data, but its spectrum is consistent with an optically thick dust shell around a blue compact starburst. We estimate the galaxy's dust temperature to be ~35 K, and we derive an upper limit on its total dust mass of 1.3 kpc^2. Given this mass, we estimate the galaxy's luminosity to be ~5 x 10^12 erg s^-1, and its absolute magnitude in the V band to be -5.4. These data therefore provide strong evidence that HUDF-JD2 is a luminous infrared galaxy at a very high redshift. We discuss this object in the context of field galaxies at intermediate redshift (z < 1), and argue that the most plausible explanation for its origin is that HUDF-JD2 is the product of a violent galactic collision at z > 2, whose debris has been slowly moving towards us over the past 7 billion years. We estimate that HUDF-JD2 is at a redshift of z ~ 2.4, and that it is 1.5 \u00b1 1.1 Mpc away. Given the low probability of a starburst galaxy having a dust temperature of 35 K, we conclude that HUDF-JD2 is an extraordinary object, and has a very low probability of being a mundane galaxy at a redshift of z < 1."}
{"text":"\n\nIntroduction\n\nWe have previously reported on the design and implementation of a SQUID-based system for ultra-low-field MRI that has the potential to bring the benefits of MRI to a new class of applications that include molecular and functional imaging. Our initial results demonstrate the potential of SQUID-based instrumentation for ultra-low-field MRI, however, several issues must be addressed in order to make this approach practical. In this work, we focus on two of these issues: signal-to-noise ratio and image artifacts.\n\nMethodology\n\nWe have designed a system of parallel SQUID arrays that is capable of eliminating the need for a flux-lock loop and thereby reducing the noise in the detected signal. This system is currently being constructed and will be the subject of future publications. In addition, we have developed a technique for suppressing the image artifacts caused by uniform magnetic fields. This technique is based on the use of a reference channel that measures the uniform field and a filtering procedure that removes the uniform field from the image.\n\nResults\n\nWe have evaluated the image quality obtained with the SQUID-based system and the effectiveness of the filtering procedure in suppressing the image artifacts. The results of this evaluation indicate that this approach is feasible for producing high quality images.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe results reported in this paper demonstrate that SQUID-based instrumentation for ultra-low-field MRI is a viable approach for producing high quality images. Further work is needed to optimize the design of the SQUID array and the filtering procedure in order to achieve the best possible image quality. In addition, this work has demonstrated that SQUID-based instrumentation can be used to measure the uniform field and thereby enable the suppression of this artifact. This capability is important for producing high quality images and is an area of active research."}

We focus on the popular family of Louvain module network algorithms that have recently received significant attention, and present a general framework for assessing the quality of the solution obtained using a particular algorithm and parameter setting. Our approach is based on generating simulated data using a combination of random forests and module networks, such that the module structure is known in advance. We then evaluate several popular Louvain module network algorithms, and demonstrate that their performance is highly dependent on the parameter setting, and in some cases the choice of algorithm. Our results show that in general, these algorithms do not recover the known module structure in the data, even when using the optimal parameter setting. We discuss the practical implications of our findings, and suggest directions for future research."}

{"text":"\nWe investigate a system of two qubits in the $XYZ$ magnetic chain with a pairwise antisymmetric exchange interaction, which has a profound effect on the entanglement of the qubits. We find that as the strength of the interaction increases, the entanglement first increases to its maximally entangled state and then decreases to zero. This is in sharp contrast to the case of an isotropic exchange interaction, where the entanglement only increases as the interaction strength increases. Our analysis shows that the non-monotonic behavior of the entanglement is due to the anisotropic nature of the exchange interaction, which leads to a purification of the entanglement from an equal mixture of entanglement in the basis states to entanglement in a pure state. We also investigate the entanglement dynamics of the system by numerically solving the master equation, and find that the entanglement first increases and then decreases as the strength of the interaction increases, consistent with our analytical result."}

{"text":"\n\nWe construct a class of analytic models of plausible gravitational lens potentials, in the approximation of a thin lens, which have a finite number of disconnected singularities. We show that theSingular Vector Method can be used to find a basis of pillow functions for these potentials, which is related to the eigenspace of the corresponding Legendre transformation. This basis can be used to evaluate the gravitational potential at any point in the lens, and in particular, at points near the singularities. We show that the gravitational field can be thought of as being composed of a finite number of multipoles, with the dominant ones corresponding to the individual singularities. This decomposition is shown to be useful in understanding the features of the gravitational field in the neighborhood of each singularity. The practical significance of this work is that it provides a means of evaluating the gravitational potential at points near the singularities, where the potential may not be well-approximated by a analytic function. This in turn is important for understanding the non-singular contributions to the image properties, and for the accurate computation of optical parameters such as the power and the throughput."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present new radio luminosity measurements for the millisecond pulsars (MSPs) PSR J1453+1902 and PSR J1650-erts. These radio luminosity measurements are derived from observations made with the Very Large Array (VLA) as part of the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Networked Grids (NANOGrav) project. We find that the radio luminosity of PSR J1453+1902 is 6.3 kpc$^{-1}$, which is one of the highest radio luminosities measured for a solitary MSP. We also find that the radio luminosity of PSR J1650-erts has a startlingly low value of 2.6 kpc$^{-1}$, which is similar to the radio luminosity measured for the MSP- companion star binaries such as PSR J1141-6545 and PSR J1708-1458. Our results raise the question of whether a large fraction of MSPs are actually members of wide binary systems that are simply not detected because of the limitations of current observing techniques. We discuss the implications of this hypothesis on the current theories of the evolution of MSPs and their companions."}

{"text":"\n\nDynamic Properties of Molecular Motors in Burnt-Bridge Models\nWe study the dynamic properties of molecular motors in burnt-bridge models. We show that the two main non-trivial dynamic states of the motor, the bound state and the unbound state, can be stable in a large range of parameters, including the extreme cases of very fast and very slow kinetics. We find a large variety of dynamic patterns, including a rich phenomenology of different types of flipping between the bound and unbound state, and different types of trajectories in the unbound state. Our findings are consistent with a large number of physical processes taking place in the dynamics of the motor, which can roughly be divided into two classes, fast and slow processes. The fast processes are related to the energy fluctuations in the motor and to the thermal agitation, and can give rise to a variety of dynamic patterns. The slow processes are related to the tunneling of the ligand molecule towards the binding site, and to the subsequent binding and unbinding. We show that the dynamics of the motor can be very well described by a simple Markov chain, which can be fully optimized, thus providing a powerful tool for the study of the dynamic properties of molecular motors."}

{"text":"\n\nWe present high-resolution observations of Orion Source I (OSI) in the mid-IR and radio, and a systematic study of the maser emission from OSIsSiO.

We discuss two alternative mechanisms that can produce the observed maser velocity distribution: (1) large-scale expansion of the maser-emitting region, and (2) small-scale random velocity fluctuations superimposed on a large-scale expansion. Our observations favor the latter explanation.

The observed\ncharacteristics of the accretion episodes are consistent with the\nrate-determined model of accretion instabilities proposed by 1996ApJ...\n500..369G to explain the accretion behavior of low-mass X-ray binaries.\nFurthermore, the accretion episodes are separated by deeper quiescent\nphases, during which the accretion is less efficient than in the\naccretion episodes. This is consistent with the hypothesis that the\naccretion episodes are triggered by the formation of accretion\nconvection cells, whereas the quiescent phases are characterized by\nthe occasional detection of an accretion burst.

{"text":"\n\nWe present hard X-ray observations of the RCW49 region in order to probe the stellar population. We use the data obtained with the XMM-Newton and Chandra X-ray telescopes, which have different spectral and spatial resolutions, to study the X-ray properties of the stellar population in the region. We find that the bulk of the X-ray emission in the region is due to an extended cluster halo and that the X-ray emission from the individual stellar objects is not correlated with the optical\/NIR colors. We argue that this is likely due to the fact that the stellar objects in the region are old and that low-mass objects with different evolutionary states (e.g., main sequence, red giants, white dwarfs) have similar optical\/NIR colors. The hard X-ray data are consistent with a scenario in which the old stellar objects in the region contain cool, low-mass objects as well as high-mass objects (e.g., ONeMg white dwarfs and, possibly, Wolf-Rayet stars). We discuss our results in the context of the ongoing debate on the nature of the stellar population in the galactic globular clusters."}
{"text":"\n\nWe investigate the quantum kinetics of a system which has the capability of producing a sterile species. We develop a general approach which treats the dynamics of the system as a whole, and take into account the correlations between the various degrees of freedom in the system.

We show that such a general approach is equivalent to a set of independent, uncorrelated degree of freedom models, each of which describes the dynamics of the corresponding degree of freedom in the system. The independent models are solved and the solution to the general model is obtained by taking the sum of the solutions to the independent models. The special case of a system with two degrees of freedom is solved analytically, and the solution is used to obtain a general formula for the stationary distribution of the total number of photons in the system. We also discuss the general properties of the solution to the full model, and show how the general solution can be used to derive the stationary distribution for a wide class of input functions."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a simple method to estimate the galaxy number density in the disk of our Milky Way by counting galaxies in an annulus in the direction of the Galactic Rim. Our galaxy census is based on a high signal-to-noise ratio galaxy redshift survey performed with the 6.5 m Magellan Telescopes and covers the redshift range 0.155 < z_gal < 1.33. We find a number density of 2.7 \u00b1 0.9 galaxies per square degree, which translates into an intergalactic volume filling factor of \u03b7_V = 1.9 \u00b1 1.4%. This result is in good agreement with previous estimates based on the 2 Micron All-Sky Survey and with a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation. Our high signal-to-noise ratio data also allow us to study the distribution of galaxies in the Galactic halo. We find that the observed distribution is consistent with a galactic fountain model with a radial galaxy number density that increases smoothly with distance from the Galactic disk before declining abruptly at large distances. The radial galaxy number density is well described by a power law with an index of -1.3 \u00b1 0.2. We have searched for strong galaxy-galaxy lensing in the same survey data. We find three candidates, but none of them could be confirmed by further analysis.

{"text":"\n\nWe present a study of off-center HII regions in power-law density distributions. The study consists of a comparison of the observed distribution of off-center HII regions in a sample of 19 galaxies with power-law density distributions, obtained from the integral field spectrograph SINFONI on the E-ELT, with the predictions of a simple model in which the formation of HII regions is related to the evolution of the over-density with radius. We find that the model is consistent with the observations and that the distribution of off-center HII regions in these galaxies is well described by a power law with a characteristic radius of 1-2 kpc and a power law index of 1.5-2. This suggests that the formation of off-center HII regions is a universal feature in power-law density distributions and that the simple model we use is valid for galaxies with power-law density distributions of different morphological types. We discuss the physical mechanism that can explain the origin of these off-center HII regions in terms of the competition between the accretion of matter and the conservation of angular momentum. We also show that the model predicts that the number of off-center HII regions is inversely proportional to the square of the central surface density. We discuss the implications of our results for the physical properties of galaxies with power-law density distributions and for the role of the cold gas phase in galaxy evolution."}

As an application, we consider the problem of finding an exact solution to a Ricci flow with a nonholonomic term, which is related to the problem of constructing a self-smoothing solution to the Ricci flow on a complete Riemannian manifold which is also a solution to the Einstein equations with a cosmological constant.

We show that this constraint is not tight for clusters with a low mass, and can be significantly relaxed if the IMBH is accompanied by a significant baryonic mass, for example in the form of a companion. We then consider the special case of a system with a low-mass IMBH (MIMBH  \u223c 1\u201310 M\u2299) and a companion with a mass of order unity, and show that the core radius is then approximately proportional to MIMBH 2 \/3.

{"text":"\n\nA new Generation of Spectrometer Calibration Techniques based on Optical Frequency Combs\n\nSpectrometry is a powerful and widely used analytical tool in many scientific disciplines for the precise determination of the spectral distribution of a signal. In recent years, the requirements on the spectral resolution of spectrometers have increased tremendously, reaching the sub-femtosecond domain for some applications. To achieve this, the use of optical frequency combs has been proposed and demonstrated. However, the practical implementation of the method is not straightforward, as it requires a precise knowledge of the spectral properties of the optical frequency comb. In this article, we review and discuss recent progress in the field of optical frequency comb-based spectrometer calibration. In particular, we focus on the techniques that have been developed to determine the spectral envelope of the optical frequency comb, which is a key parameter for the correct interpretation of the experimental data. We also discuss the problem of the frequency stability of the optical frequency comb and the techniques that have been developed to stabilize it. Finally, we present a brief overview of the current state-of-the-art of optical frequency comb-based spectrometry and highlight open questions and future research directions."}

{"text":"\n\nWe revisit the Fermi golden rule for light emission from a quantum point source in the presence of a relativistic, time-dependent, electric field. We show that, in addition to the usual steady-state approximation, the time-dependence of the electric field can be taken into account in a straightforward way by means of a phase-space transformation. We consider a general class of such transformations that allows one to account for any time-dependent field, in particular, an oscillating field. We show that in this way the dependence of the radiated energy on the field frequency can be rendered either slightly or strongly non-linear, in a way that depends on the initial quantum state of the source. As an example, we consider the particular case of a hydrogen-like atom, and show that our approach is able to account for several non-linear effects that are usually considered as \"anomalies\" in the hydrogen spectrum, such as the red and blue shifts of the emission line. We also derive a simple, general expression for the radiated energy that is valid for an extremely large range of field frequencies, and show that it has a \"privileged\" value at which the emitted radiation is completely coherent, in spite of the fact that the driving field is usually considered as completely incoherent. We analyze the physical meaning of this privileged value, and show that it is related to a \"c Rokhsar-Kivelson radius\" associated with the constant factor in the radiated energy. Finally, we discuss a possible physical interpretation of our results in terms of a \"quantum dynamical phase transition\" that occurs when a relativistic, time-dependent, electric field is turned on in the vicinity of a quantum system."}
{"text":"\n\nPolytrope stability is investigated by a formal asymptotic method, based on the study of the evolution of the principal torus during the polytropic compression. The behavior of the function which describes the evolution of the torus is analyzed by means of the WKB method, and the associated instability thresholds are determined as a function of the polytropic index. Two different methods of studying the evolution of the torus are employed: the first one is based on the use of the boundary conditions at the equatorial plane, while the second one makes use of the boundary conditions on the axisymmetric symmetry plane. In both cases the relevant unstable modes are found to be the eigenvectors of a suitable symmetric tridiagonal matrix, and the respective eigenvalues are calculated exactly in the first case, and approximately in the second case. The practical application of the present work is the study of the stability of spherically symmetric polytrops, which are attractive candidates for compact stellar objects, such as black holes or compact stars. As an example, the recently found intermediate-mass black holes are assumed to be spherical and polytropic, with a relatively low polytropic index, and the stability of such a configuration is investigated by means of the asymptotic method developed in the present work."}
{"text":"\n\nBinary Quantum Search\nWe introduce and study a new quantum search algorithm for finding the left-most or right-most element of a superposition of 0s and 1s that matches a given search key. The algorithm is based on a binary search in the overlap between the search key and the transformed search superposition. For a successful search, the number of qubits in the search superposition that are simultaneously in the right state (here, the state that matches the search key) must be higher than the number of qubits in the overlap. The algorithm can be designed to be quantum-safe, in the sense that it does not reveal the search key by its input-output behavior. We analyze the algorithm and find the necessary and sufficient conditions for a successful search. The analysis is based on the use of the randomness assumption and a generalization of the notion of a characteristic function for probabilistic systems. In particular, we show that for a successful search the algorithm requires that the search key has a low Hamming distance from the all-0s state, and that the input probability distribution is such that the randomness assumption can be justified. As an application, we show that the algorithm can be used to design a quantum-safe hash function that is efficient on a quantum computer. We also analyze the competitive ratio of the algorithm as a function of the number of qubits in the search superposition."}
{"text":"\n\nAgeing memory and glassiness of a driven vortex system\n\nWe consider a recently proposed model of memory formation in self-sustained vortex systems. We show that such memory formation is closely connected with the ageing process. In particular we show that the memory vector of a system which has been driven for a sufficiently long time has the same direction as the amplitude of the ageing rate. In the limit of a large number of vortices the direction of the memory vector is equal to the velocity of the driving. In this way we can interpret the memory as a kind of 'apparent motion' of the system. The problem we attempt to solve is the following: What happens if we drive the system in such a way that the actual motion and the direction of the memory vector are not parallel? In such a case the memory has to be \"reset\" every time the actual motion changes its direction. We show that such \"resetting\" of the memory has a strong impact on the statistical properties of the system. In particular, we show that such driving can lead to a glassy state of the system. We discuss a possible physical realization of our model in a model of superconducting vortices on a square lattice."}
{"text":"\nWe present an investigation into the role of massive stars in globular cluster formation. We find that massive stars are capable of triggering globular cluster formation in molecular clouds by providing the energy required to collapse the cloud core. The resulting clusters will contain a large number of massive stars. We have developed a method to estimate the initial mass function of clusters from their observed number density and the mass function of the surrounding molecular cloud. We find that the initial mass function of the clusters is well described by a power law with a negative index. We have also developed a simple model for the evolution of clusters with a given initial mass function. Our results show that massive stars have a significant effect on cluster evolution, and that the number density of massive stars in clusters increases with cluster mass. Our results are consistent with massive stars being a major, perhaps the major, source of energy for cluster formation and evolution."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a multi-object spectroscopy study of RCS-1 clusters at moderately high redshift (z < 1), using the Australian National University's 1.3-m telescope on Mount Stromlo. These clusters were first discovered in data from the Two-Micron All-Sky Survey, and are the most distant known today. We aim to measure the cluster redshifts, metallicities and sizes, in order to investigate the evolution of galaxy clusters and the large-scale structure of the Universe. In particular, we wish to test the hypothesis that clusters are still forming efficiently at these high redshifts. We find that the clusters have redshifts in the range 0.8 < z < 1.1, metallicities in the range [M\/Z] < +0.3, and sizes in the range 1.4 < R < 5.4 kpc. The clusters contain galaxies which are themselves at moderate redshift, and not simply foreground or background galaxies. The observed properties of the clusters are consistent with their being in the process of collapse and cooling, and not yet fully relaxed. We conclude that clusters are still able to form efficiently at these high redshifts, and discuss the implications for cluster evolution and for the large-scale structure of the Universe."}

{"text":"\nWe construct two-dimensional twisted sigma models for generalised mirror symmetry. We show that the models have unique rigid algebras of Killing generators, but that their symmetry is nevertheless significantly more complicated than that of the corresponding anti-twisted sigma models, and that this complexity is captured by the structure of the rigid algebra. In particular, we show that the twisted rigid algebra is always equivalent to that of a \"mirror chiral\" de Rham complex. As an application, we give a description of the symmetry of the thermodynamic limit of the twisted sigma model in terms of the adjoint representation of the rigid algebra. We show that this description provides a rigorous formulation of the symmetry of the thermodynamic limit which was previously understood only heuristically. We also show that the same description provides a rigorous formulation of the structure of the rigid algebra of a sigma model with a non-trivial vacuum structure, which was previously understood only heuristically."}
{"text":"\nWe present a systematic study of theinstabilities of rotating black holes in full general relativity, usinga formalism that unifies the procedures for identifying and quantifyingthe relevant instabilities in a general relativistic context. Thisunified approach, which we dub the 'new standard model' for blackhole instabilities, is based on the formalism developed byBarcel\u00f3, 1999. We derive an integral equation for the flux (per unitvolume) of the unstable part of the solution, and identify a thresholdvalue for the onset of instability. We find that the assumption ofgeodetic precession, which is standard in the analysis ofinstabilities in general relativity, is not adequate to describe themodest instability thresholds for a given system; the departure fromgeodetic precession can be either positive or negative. This hasimplications for the interpretation of the global structure of thephoton sphere, as well as the local structure of the orbit close tothe black hole. We analyze the effects of higher-order corrections,and find that, although the differences are typically small, they canbe crucial in systems that are close to being unstable. We also studythe instabilities of the mono-energetic and poly-energetic sine-waveinputs, for a range of parameters, and find that in certainparameter regimes the mono-energetic case is more unstable than thepoly-energetic case. This has implications for the evolution of tornacings from a poly-energetic source, as well as toreventures into black hole spacetimes from the outside."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider the Larkin-Ovchinnikov-Fulde-Ferrell (LOFF) state in two-color quark matter. The LOFF state is a quasistationary state of compact stars, which is realized in the two-color quark matter when the coupling constant is sufficiently large. In this state the quark matter is in a uniformly rotating state, and the color fields are in a stationary state with a structure similar to that of the Earth's magnetic field. We show that the existence of the LOFF state is guaranteed by the inclusion of a single additional parameter in the quark Hamiltonian, and this state is unique in a certain range of the parameter values. We also show that this state is very stable, and in certain range of the parameter values it is stable against all the deformations of the color fields. The rotation of the quark matter in this state is uniform, and the addition of a constant vector to the rotation vector does not change the structure of the state. We discuss the consequences of our results for the theory of quark stars and for the theory of the LOFF state itself."}
{"text":"\n\nDistinguishability of Quantum States by Separable Operations\nWe study the problem of distinguishability of quantum states of a composite system, defined by a Hilbert space of dimension two, by performing local operations and classical communication.

As an application, we show that if the operations are to be taken from a certain class of non-identity operations, the set of operations can be chosen to be the direct product of a set of operators corresponding to a distinguishable basis, and so the distinguishability can be achieved by a set of local operations and classical communication. We also consider the same problem for the case of an arbitrary composite system, and show that if the distinguishability is to be achieved by a set of operations, each of which can be written as a composite system's operation, the set of operations must contain at least one operation which is not a direct product of a set of operators corresponding to a distinguishable basis."}
{"text":"\n\nWe revisit the problem of direct $J\/\\psi$ production at the Fermilab Tevatron. We re-examine the existing theoretical framework in the context of the recent measurements of $J\/\\psi$ production cross sections at hadron colliders, and extract a simple prescription for the Tevatron. This prescription gives a cross section that is consistent with the data, and is within the range of theoretical predictions. In this framework, the $J\/\\psi$ production cross section at the Tevatron depends only on the center of mass energy, and is proportional to $e^{\\pm i \\phi}$, where $\\phi$ is the Tevatron energy. We show that this prescription has a simple physical explanation, in terms of the structure of the $J\/\\psi$ wave function and the structure of the strongly interacting matter created at the Tevatron. We also show that this prescription is consistent with the current theoretical framework for $J\/\\psi$ production at hadron colliders, if one assumes that the $J\/\\psi$ production cross section at the Tevatron is small compared to the next-to-leading order QCD prediction. \n\nWe then use this prescription to re-analyze the existing $J\/\\psi$ production data taken at the Tevatron, and find that the data can be explained within the context of this framework. In particular, we show that the previous discrepancy between the data and theoretical predictions can be resolved by considering a non-perturbative QCD prediction that is extracted from the analysis of the data. We also show that this prescription can be used to predict the $J\/\\psi$ production cross section at the LHC, and that this prediction is consistent with the LHC data. \n\nWe also use this prescription to make a prediction for a possible $J\/\\psi$ production measurement at the Tevatron, which could settle the question of the $J\/\\psi$ production cross section at the Tevatron once and for all."}

In particular, we show that if the strong interval conjecture holds for a level Hilbert function, then this function takes its maximum value on the strong interval, and if the weak interval conjecture holds, then this function takes its minimum value on the weak interval. We show further that both the strong and weak interval conjectures are equivalent to certain forms of the strong and weak Restricted Conjectures for Pisot and Rapoport functions, and that both conjectures are also equivalent to a conjecture of Finger on interval functions."}
{"text":"\nWe consider a set of equations for transient enhanced diffusion in shallow ion-implanted layers, which takes into account both the ionization of the adatoms and their diffusion in the crystal lattice. The model is based on the solution of the over-limiting secular equation for the transient enhanced diffusion coefficient, which takes into account the bulk and surface concentrations of the diffusing species as well as the excess energy due to ionization. The excess energy determines the boundary layer thickness, where the ionized adatoms can move freely. Our model can be used to investigate the transient diffusion in shallow layers of various semiconducting and dielectric materials with different types of implanted ions, as well as to study the transient behavior of the diffusion process in dependence of the implantation energy and dose. The practical importance of the model is illustrated by our analysis of the transient diffusion in silicon layers, which is relevant for the process of shallow ion implantation and for the development of ultra-shallow semiconductor structures."}
{"text":"\n\nWe study a k-dependent SU(4) model of high-temperature superconductivity and its coherent-state solutions. The model has a particular non-Abelian symmetry group which includes a two-by-two SU(2) sub-block and a two-by-two identity block. The model is a generalization of the so-called k-map model. The k-map model has been extensively studied from the viewpoint of a microscopic mechanism of superconductivity, and many interesting results have been obtained. We first show that the k-dependent SU(4) model has a unique solution of the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson (LGW) type in a certain parameter range, and that this solution is in a highly degenerate state in the entire parameter range. Then we show that the coherent states of the model can be solved exactly in the thermodynamic limit, and that these solutions have a one-to-one correspondence with the coherent states of the k-map model. Our results indicate that the non-Abelian symmetry group in the k-dependent SU(4) model is not a physical parameter in the mechanism of superconductivity, but has a crucial role in the structure of the LGW solution."}

We show that the induced symmetry on the worldsheet, as measured by the total left- and right-istorque, flows in an affine space which in general is non-degenerate. We give a general formula for the first non-trivial measure on this space. We show that this measure is related to the RG flow of a model which is defined by a non-trivial restriction of the primary model and which we call the \" ghosts sigma model\". This ghosts sigma model is not a full fledged sigma model, but rather a model with a \" ghost \" symmetry group, to which the usual sigma group is related by an inner automorphism. We show that the ghosts sigma model has a vanishingly small weight, and that its flow is trivial. We show that the non-triviality of the flow of the primary model is protected by an appropriate constraint on the structure of the ghosts sigma model. We show further that the primary model flow becomes trivial whenever the ghosts sigma model has a trivial flow. We comment on the possible physical implications of our results."}
{"text":"\n\nWe have measured the vibrational infrared lifetime of the anesthetic nitrous oxide gas in solution, using a pump-probe spectroscopic method based on optical Kerr-effect Fourier-transform spectroscopy. Our results show that the vibrational lifetime is strongly dependent on the structural properties of the host solvent. In particular, we found that small polar molecules such as acetonitrile and methanol as well as ionic liquids are the best hosts for nitrous oxide, while hydrocarbons and large polar molecules such as water are the worst hosts. Our results explain the experimental observation that ionic liquids are particularly good carriers of nitrous oxide, while water is a very poor carrier. We attribute the strong dependence of the vibrational lifetime on the structural properties of the host solvent to the ability of nitrous oxide to form weak hydrogen bonds. Our results suggest that the hydrogen bond network in the host solvent can strongly affect the lifetime of a guest molecule, even if the guest molecule is not capable of forming any hydrogen bonds itself."}

In particular, such walks can have non-backtracking trajectories even in the thermodynamic limit. We show that this is because the random walk can have correlations on higher-level structures (i.e., correlations between the walk's global features), in addition to the local correlations between the steps of the walk. We also show that the occurrence of such higher-level correlations depends on the details of the step-size distribution. We consider different possible forms for the step-size distribution and find that a heavy-tailed form of distribution gives rise to a walk which is strongly non-backtracking, even in the presence of a large number of steps.

{"text":"\n\nWe investigate the effect of geometrical anisotropy on the demixing and orientational ordering of mixtures of non-Brownian rigid particles that are either cylindrical or rectangular. We consider a range of volume fractions and aspect ratios for the two types of particles in order to obtain a clear picture of the effects of geometry on the microstructure evolution. We find that rectangular particles have a strong tendency to form a percolating network, whereas cylindrical particles do not. For mixtures of equal volumes of both types of particles, a unique demixing transition is observed as the aspect ratio of the rectangular particles is increased, and the volume fraction of the cylindrical particles is decreased. We show that this transition is associated with a competition between a desire for the rectangular particles to form a percolating network, and a tendency for the cylindrical particles to form a disordered structure that resists the formation of a network. For mixtures comprising large rectangular particles and small cylindrical particles, we find that the cylindrical particles tend to form a compact orientationally ordered structure that is stabilized by the anisotropic attractive interactions between the rectangular particles. We observe a strong tendency for the rectangular particles to form a structure with a preferred orientation, which is influenced by the underlying cylindrical structure. Our results are explained using a simple model of the interactions between the two types of particles, which we validate using numerical simulations."}

{"text":"\n\nWe propose and demonstrate a novel technique to generate intense ultrashort laser pulses with a frequency upshifted by one or more optical phonons with a relativistic flying mirror in the context of tennis-like laser cavity. Two or more laser pulses are injected into a laser cavity with a frequency difference of the order of an optical phonon energy. The generated pulses exhibit a bandwidth up to three times larger than the injected ones, and a duration up to two times shorter. The maximum upshifted frequency is determined by the pulse energy and the reflectivity of the flying mirror. We also show that the conversion efficiency can be significantly enhanced by implementing a multi-pass configuration. The method is demonstrated experimentally with a 10-fold increase in the frequency for ultrashort laser pulses, and a four-fold increase for nanosecond pulses, which is limited by the longitudinal optical phonon energy of the titanium:sapphire (Ti:Sa) crystal. Our work paves the way for the generation of intense ultrashort laser pulses with a frequency different from that of the pump laser. It could be useful in the context of optical frequency conversion, for the generation of ultraviolet or infrared light, or in the field of high-energy lasers for beam combination purposes."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a model for the long-term behaviour of the Earth's plasmasheet, a part of the magnetosphere that is important for the long-term exposure of the Moon to ionospheric plasma. The model consists of a self-consistent, time-dependent solution of the ponderomotive force, continuity equation, and energy equation for the plasma. The solution includes a bounce-back of plasma from the Moon that is able to accelerate due to the conservation of energy. We show that this effect can be balanced by a decrease in the ionospheric plasma pressure due to an outward flow of plasma from the plasmasheet. We evaluate the model by comparison with in situ measurements from the Cassini spacecraft at Saturn, where a strong shadowing of the plasmasheet by the rings creates a morphology similar to that observed at the Moon. We find that the model is able to produce long-term (decadal) variations in the exposure to ionospheric plasma of the Moon, without the need to include additional ad-hoc mechanisms. The inclusion of the model in global circulation models for the Moon is discussed."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider the evolution of charged particle energy distributions in the pseudogap regime of a quantum plasma in the presence of a uniform background magnetic field and low-frequency electromagnetic perturbations. We show than non-monotonic evolution of the charged particle energy distribution function with the ratio of the plasma frequency to the frequency of the applied electromagnetic perturbations may lead to a crossover between the Collective Micellar Instability (CMI) growth rate and its complement, which results in a maximum in the growth rate as a function of this ratio. We also show that this maximum may be sensitive to the shape of the charged particle energy distribution function, in particular to the width of the distribution in the energy region close to the plasma energy. Our results are consistent with the observation of a maximum in the CMI growth rate as a function of the ratio of the plasma frequency to the frequency of the applied electromagnetic perturbations in the pseudogap regime of the Greenland Sea, as reported in Ref. [Gontsov, 2014]. Our explanation for this maximum is based on a simple qualitative model, which describes the evolution of the charged particle energy distribution function in the presence of low-frequency electromagnetic perturbations and a uniform background magnetic field. We show that the model is consistent with the general shape of the charged particle energy distribution function in the pseudogap regime. We also discuss the role of the electron velocity distribution in the growth of the CMI."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present radial velocities for about 55000 stars in the solar neighbourhood obtained from spectral synthesis of their H\u03b1 and H\u03b2 lines. The new data set has a mean radial velocity of 53 km s-1, a root mean square (rms) radial velocity of 9.3 km s-1, and a relative rms radial velocity of 3.2%. These data are intended to be used as a radial velocity standard in the solar neighbourhood for the optical range. The data set is freely available on the web. We also present the mean radial velocities for 516 Galactic open clusters and associations. The data set includes clusters in the Solar Neighbourhood Extension, the Local Cloud, and the Corona Australis molecular cloud. The radial velocities have been determined from a re-analysis of existing literature data. We found a significant bias in the literature data, with most of the clusters in the Solar Neighbourhood Extension having radial velocities around \u2212 30 km s-1. When these clusters are excluded, the mean radial velocity of the remaining clusters is zero within the uncertainty limits. We also present a comparison between the properties of the clusters in the Solar Neighbourhood Extension and clusters in the Local Cloud. The clusters in the Solar Neighbourhood Extension are on average more distant, more metal-poor, and have higher surface photometric metallicities than the clusters in the Local Cloud. We also present an analysis of the clusters with available distance estimates. The radial velocities of these clusters are consistent with their being at the same distance. We discuss these results in the framework of the current theories of the structure and evolution of the Galactic disk."}
{"text":"\n\nWe have investigated the problem of spin transport in magnetic multilayers. We have used a microscopic model which includes the spin dependent bulk and interface scattering processes. Within this model we have evaluated the dependence of the spin dependent transport properties on the thickness of the layer as well as on the detailed structure of the multilayer. We have found that in spite of the fact that the individual magnetic layers are weakly coupled with each other, the structure of the multiplayer can have a strong influence on the spin dependent transport properties. Our results show that in general the spin transport in magnetic multilayers is much more complex than in a single magnetic layer and therefore the behavior of the spin dependent transport properties in magnetic multilayers can not be simply derived from the properties of the individual magnetic layers.\n\nWe have also studied the problem of the compatibility of the spin transport in magnetic multilayers with the standard Boltzmann transport equation. We have found that in the case of the transport in multilayers consisting of few magnetic layers, the standard Boltzmann transport equation can be used in a good approximation, however, in the case of a large number of magnetic layers or in the case of complicated layer structures, the Boltzmann equation can not be used any more and a more complicated equation has to be derived in order to describe the spin transport in magnetic multilayers."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a theory of the electrostatic interactions of asymmetrically charged membranes. The theory is based on a simple, first-principles, microscopic model of the membrane, which we solve numerically. We show that the membrane potential is a linear combination of the potentials of the different charged components of the membrane, and that the resulting potential is very well described by a model in which the membrane is represented by a single point charge, located at the center of mass of the membrane. This theory is very general, and can be applied to any system in which the relevant electrostatic interactions are weak, regardless of the detailed structure of the system. As an example application, we consider the role of the electrostatic interactions in the formation of liposomes from lipid molecules. We find that the electrostatic interactions are significant for systems in which the lipids are charged, and that they can either stabilize the resulting liposome, or make it less stable. We also consider the role of the electrostatic interactions in the transport of small charged molecules through a membrane. We find that the dependence of the transport on the molecular charge is in general rather complex, and depends on the detailed structure of the membrane."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present an analysis of the formation of early-type R stars in galactic globular clusters. We show that the main sequence turn-off luminosity, and hence the observed colours, of these stars can be reproduced by a simple binary-merger scenario, provided that the donor star has a mass between 1 and 2 M\u2299. The merging process is relatively slow, with the two stars becoming equal-mass binaries with a wide orbit before their evolution is affected by the relativistic effects that are known to cause the rapid brightness variations typical of these stars. We also discuss the influence of the initial orbital eccentricity on the evolution of the system, and show that a wide eccentric orbit can be obtained either by an initial close-in orbit with large orbital eccentricity or by a merger process that is relatively slow. We show that the available observations are consistent with this scenario. In particular, the properties of R stars in galactic globular clusters are consistent with the idea that their donors have masses between 1 and 2 M\u2299, and there is evidence that their initial orbits were wide. We discuss the practical implications of this work for the reliability of using R stars as standard candles, and the limitations of current observations in probing the precise mechanism that triggers their evolution."}
{"text":"\nWe have developed a new test for anthropic predictions for the scalar spectral index, \\Lambda, and the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature, T. Our test consists of a comparison of the predicted distribution of the scalars in the presence of an optimal Roche lobe filling planet, to the actual distribution observed in the Milky Way. We find that the prediction fails by a large margin. After correcting for selection effects, we conclude that there are no anthropic consequences for the distribution of massive planets in the Milky Way. We also test the CMB temperature prediction and find no support for it.\n\nWe then develop a general framework for an anthropic explanation of the distribution of scalars. We show that such an explanation requires an a priori assumption that the scalars have a specific distribution. We demonstrate that there are several such consistent assumptions, and that they can naturally explain why the Milky Way is not at the anthropic limit for the distribution of scalars. However, the assumptions required are not unique, and therefore do not provide a definitive answer to the question of why the Milky Way is not at the anthropic limit for scalars.\n\nWe also re-examine the usual explanation for the origin of the CMB temperature and find that it is inconsistent with the observed correlation between the CMB temperature and the distribution of massive planets. We propose a new explanation that is consistent with the correlation, but does not require an anthropic explanation for the CMB temperature."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a theory of elastic stresses and their role in leaf venation morphogenesis. We consider a thin, elastic, and anisotropic sheet which is incompressible in the thickness direction. The sheet is assumed to be in a state of plane-strain with elastic constants which vary in the plane. In the limit of small thickness, the sheet energy is shown to minimize the total elastic stress. This leads to the system of elastic equations which govern the evolution of the elastic stresses. We solve these equations for a variety of forms of the elastic constants. The solutions show several different patterns of elastic stresses which are possible. We also relate our theory to the observation that the elastic constants often have a gradient in the direction of the leaf margin. The elastic stress patterns we find have a variety of possible relationships to the arrangement of the primary and secondary veins. We also discuss the possible physical mechanisms which may cause the elastic constants to take on the values we find in our theory."}

{"text":"\n\nExtrasolar planet taxonomy: a new statistical approach.\nA large number of extrasolar planets have been discovered in the last two decades, and the origin of these planets is still a matter of debate. The first step in assessing the relative importance of the different formation mechanisms is to obtain a correct census of the extrasolar planets. The census should include not only the number of planets, but also the properties of the planets, such as their mass, radius, and orbital parameters. Unfortunately, the available observations are often insufficient to determine these properties with the required level of precision, and statistical techniques are needed to improve the determination. We present here a new method, based on a robust and reliable statistical model, for obtaining improved estimates of the properties of extrasolar planets. The method is based on a regression model with a robust kernel density estimator as the basis function. The method is applied to the analysis of the transit data of extrasolar planets, but it can in principle be applied to other types of data as well. The use of the method is demonstrated by applying it to the analysis of the properties of a large sample of extrasolar planets."}
{"text":"\n\nNetwork Structure of Protein Folding Pathways\n\nThe folding pathway of a protein is a complex, non-linear, and dynamic process that can be affected by many factors such as protein sequence, environmental conditions, and the intrinsic thermodynamics of the folding process. There has been significant progress in the past few years in understanding the structural and thermodynamic aspects of protein folding pathways. However, the role of the network structure of the folding pathway in the folding process is still not well understood.\n\nWe have developed a new algorithm to reconstruct the network structure of protein folding pathways using a combination of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and network theory. Our algorithm is based on the concept of network flows, which allows us to identify the most likely path of a protein as it folds. We have applied our algorithm to a number of proteins with known folding pathways, and have compared the resulting network structures to the known pathways.\n\nOur results show that the network structures of protein folding pathways are complex and dynamic, and can be affected by many factors such as protein sequence, environmental conditions, and the intrinsic thermodynamics of the folding process. In some cases, we found that the network structure of the folding pathway was consistent with the known pathway, while in other cases, we found that the network structure was not consistent with the known pathway.\n\nOur results suggest that the network structure of protein folding pathways is an important factor in the folding process, and that understanding the network structure of folding pathways may be a useful tool in predicting the folding pathways of other proteins."}
{"text":"\n\nThe structure and evolution of the photon-dominated region (PDR) of Barnard 68 are investigated using a large suite of observations obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope. We find that the PDR has a complex and dynamic structure, with a bright rim and a series of bright knots along the inner edge. The PDR also shows a non-axisymmetric structure, with a bright bar-like feature along the west-west direction. We find that the PDR has a smoothly varying surface brightness, with a brightness distribution that is well described by a power law with a high power law index. The PDR has a total mass of 1.1 kpc $M_{\\rm gas}$, which is much larger than the half-light radius of 0.28 kpc. We show that a simple model in which the gas is treated as isothermal and homogenous can quantitatively reproduce the basic features of the PDR, but a more sophisticated model that takes into account the temperature distribution is needed to reproduce the complex structure of the inner edge. We also investigate the distribution of ionized gas in the PDR, and find that it is well described by a two-temperature model with a temperature ratio of 2.2, which is consistent with the predictions of simple theoretical models."}
{"text":"\n\nA near-infrared\/optical\/X-ray survey in the centre of sigma Orionis\n\nWe present a multiwavelength photometric and spectroscopic study of the central region of the young stellar object sigma Orionis. Our aim was to investigate the nature of the obscuring material in the outer circumstellar layer and to derive constraints on the mass of the obscured young stellar object. We find that the extinction towards the central star is strongly dependent on the wavelength, with the extinction being lowest in the near-infrared. We determine the extinction to be of order 0.6 in the near-infrared and 1.2 in the optical, with a best-fit model requiring an extinction coefficient of 0.12+0.03-0.01 in the near-infrared and 0.26+0.03-0.02 in the optical. The observed extinction in the near-infrared is lower than expected on the basis of simple models of the scattering by an opaque layer of small particles, requiring a relatively transparent inner layer with a significant column density. We discuss this in the framework of a model in which the obscuring material consists of an inner layer of relatively transparent material and an outer layer of relatively opaque small particles. We derive an upper limit of 1.2 M() on the mass of the obscured young stellar object, assuming that the optical extinction is due to the inner layer only. The mass-limiting radius is 5-10 R(), which is larger than the size of the optically-obscured region but is consistent with the size of the NIR-obscured region. We discuss this in the framework of a model in which the obscuring material is a wind of small particles, with the inner layer being a result of an earlier episode of accretion. We find that this model is consistent with the observed extinction in the different wavelength bands, the position-versity-velocity data, and the relative sizes of the optically- and NIR-obscured regions."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present observations of the radio continuum emission from the Sy 1.5 galaxy NGC 5033, conducted with the Karl G.

We have imaged NGC 5033 in four bands centered at 1.3, 1.4, 1.6, and 2.3 GHz, covering a frequency range of 8 GHz. We find that the galaxy has a classical double-humped radio spectrum, with a bright core and a pair of prominent radio lobes. The mean spectral index is -0.7, but the core is relatively featureless, with a flat spectrum that is consistent with a power law with a spectral index of -1.1. We find that the dust temperature is quite uniform across the galaxy, with a mean temperature of 70 K. The mean density is \u03c1 \u2248 5 cm-3, with a minimum in the core and a maximum in the radio lobes. We have compared the morphology of the radio source to that of the optical and IR sources, and find that the radio source is much more extended than the optical source, but has a similar structure to the mid-IR source. This is consistent with a model in which the UV and optical sources are close to the center of the galaxy, while the radio source is much more extended, perhaps corresponding to the disk or to a jet that has been driven out through the disk."}

{"text":"\nWe present a comparison of the substellar mass function (SMF) of the young cluster Sigma Orionis based on optical, near-infrared (NIR), and IRAC\/Spitzer photometry of brown dwarfs and planetary-mass objects. We show that the SMF of the low-mass members of Sigma Orionis, extending down to M-dwarfs, is well described by a power law with a linear trend of slope -1.35 \u00b1 0.06 and offset of +0.18 \u00b1 0.07. The young cluster members have a flatter SMF than do field stars, but the difference is not significant. This is consistent with the interpretation that the mass function of the low-mass members is shaped by the cumulative gravitational effects of the massive members. We find that the two sets of objects in the cluster with the largest number of members, those with M-band magnitudes between +0.8 and +1.8 and those with IRAC\/Spitzer magnitudes between 2.9 and 3.4, have different power-law slopes and offsets, implying that the lowest-mass members of Sigma Orionis form in two distinct mass-function regimes. The offsets of the two SMFs are consistent with the lowest-mass members having formed in a manner that is relatively inefficient in terms of converting gas into solids. We discuss the implications of our findings for models of the formation of brown dwarfs and planetary-mass objects."}

{"text":"\n\nWe consider the relic abundance of dark matter in universal extra dimension (UED) models with right-handed neutrinos. We show that the total dark matter density can be either larger or smaller than the one predicted by the standard model (SM) when the right-handed neutrinos have a small but non-zero mass. When the right-handed neutrinos have a large enough mass to become the dominant dark matter component, the total dark matter density can be either larger or smaller than the one predicted by the SM, depending on the model parameters. We also show that the small-scale structure formation can be enhanced or suppressed by the right-handed neutrinos in the UED models. We find that the suppression of small-scale structure formation is more severe when the right-handed neutrinos have a small but non-zero mass, while it is more enhanced when the right-handed neutrinos have a large enough mass to become the dominant dark matter component.

The optical spectrum is very blue with a high continuum luminosity, which is typical of a quasar in the initial phase of accretion outbursts. A 1-yr continuum variability monitoring shows that the quasar varies by a factor of ~3 in optical luminosity on timescales of days. We have detected an accretion episode in January 2006, when the continuum emission increased by a factor of ~3 in 2 months. The UV continuum is an order of magnitude fainter than the optical continuum, and it is heavily absorbed by the dust clouds in the quasar's host galaxy. We have derived the mean molecular weight of the gas in the accretion region to be 44.4 \u00b1 2.0 atomic units. A 1-yr monitoring of the CO absorption lines in the quasar's host galaxy shows that the molecular gas kinematics is very chaotic and may be driven by the quasar's outbursts.

{"text":"\nWe study the effects of strong correlations on the unitary dynamics of spin 1\/2 fermions in finite lattices. We consider a class of models in which the spin degree of freedom is a continuous variable that can take on values from -1 to +1. This is in contrast to the case of spin 1 fermions, where the spin degree of freedom is a discrete variable that can only take on values from -1 to +1. We show that for these models the dynamics of the spin degree of freedom can be described by a linear differential equation, which can be solved analytically. We then use this solution to study the effects of correlations on the dynamics of the spin degree of freedom. We find that the dynamics of the spin degree of freedom is significantly more complex in the presence of strong correlations than in the absence of correlations. In particular, we find that the time evolution of the spin degree of freedom can be either completely chaotic or completely regular, depending on the strength of the correlations. We also find that the dynamics of the spin degree of freedom can be completely non-linear, in the sense that the time evolution of the spin degree of freedom can be fully described by a non-linear differential equation."}

We propose an algorithm that, given the matrix representing the equality constraints of the PM, computes a population of the possible unique joint configurations. Each configuration is represented by a vector in the null space of the matrix. The computation is based on the theory of rank-nullity decomposition of matrices.

In this design, the SDOF mobile base is designed to have a large motion range to cover a big work space.

We discuss various physical mechanisms which may cause the correlation between the X-ray and optical variability, and the different behavior of the 2MASS PL galaxies in comparison to the optically-selected galaxies.

{"text":"\n\nWe present photometric observations of the remote Galactic globular cluster NGC 2419, obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The main aim of our investigation is to study the metallicities of the cluster's constituent stars in order to infer the nature of the primordial cloud from which the cluster was born. Our analysis of the HST data shows a clear difference in metallicities between the cluster's northern and southern subsamples. The northern subsample has a higher metallicicity, with a mean value of [Fe\/H] \u2248 +0.5, while the southern subsample has a metallicicity of [Fe\/H] \u2248 +0.6, close to the Galactic value. We discuss several possible mechanisms which may explain this difference. We also present a comparison of the photometry of NGC 2419 with the available optical and ultraviolet photometry of the other Galactic globular clusters. Our analysis shows that the colors of the light emitted by the clusters are consistent with the cluster stars having been born in a cloud with a relatively high metallicity, and being subsequently diluted by a large number of low-mass stars, possibly formed in a molecular cloud with a low metallicity. We discuss this result in the framework of the available chemical models for Galactic globular cluster formation."}
{"text":"\n\nWe have developed a model that shows a connection between the bulge properties and the bimodality of galaxies. Our model is based on the assumption that the distribution of stars in the bulge region depends only on the total mass of the bulge and on the mass of the surrounding disc. We have derived a simple expression for the distribution of stars in the bulge region. This expression is in good agreement with the observations. Our model predicts that the number of stars in the bulge region increases superlinearly with the increase of the total bulge mass. We have also derived a simple expression for the fraction of the total number of stars in the bulge region. This fraction increases with the increase of the total bulge mass, but decreases with the increase of the disc mass. We have used the properties of the mock galaxies generated by the computer program GALAS to check the predictions of our model. We have found that the properties of the mock galaxies are in good agreement with the predictions of our model. Our model also predicts that the number of stars in the bulge region increases with the increase of the stellar mass of the bulge, but decreases with the increase of the stellar mass of the disc.

We find that a significant fraction (43%) of the red giants in the cluster are below the expected mass for the RGB, consistent with the hypothesis that a large number of low-mass stars suffer significant mass loss on the RGB. We show that the current mean metallicity of the RGB is [Fe\/H] \u2248 +0.3 dex, consistent with the cluster having formed in a medium- metallicity environment, and having lost a significant fraction of its initial metal content. We discuss the evolution of the cluster and find that the current RGB is very well described by the simple King-oshima model, with an age of 12 Gyr, a star formation rate of 0.45 R\u2299 yr-1, and a mass loss rate of 1.1 R\u2299 yr-1. We find that the cluster has a significant population of low-mass white dwarfs, with a current mass of about 8.5 R\u2299. We show that this population is comprised of stars with initial masses in the range 1.5\u20132.5 M\u2299, that have lost a significant fraction of their mass on the RGB, and that have therefore cooled and contracted to become low-mass white dwarfs. We conclude that significant mass loss on the RGB is a common feature of globular clusters, and that it can have a major impact on the evolution of the cluster, affecting both the structure of the red giant branch and the properties of the low-mass white dwarf population."}
{"text":"\nWe present observations of the low-mass X-ray binary PSR J1852+0040 in the Galactic globular cluster Kesteven 79. The system consists of a magnetized, weakly- magnetized-at-birth neutron star with a relatively long spin-down lifetime, accreting from a Donor, and an accretion disc around the Donor. We observed the system in quiescence, and found that the accretion disc is not actively accreting, and that the system is in a relatively long spin-down epoch. Our observations are consistent with the disc being in a quiescent state, possibly due to a relatively high mass-transfer rate during accretion, compared to the accretion rate during the short spin-up epochs. We conclude that a large fraction of low-mass X-ray binaries in globular clusters are in this type of quiescent state, and that this could provide a natural explanation for the lack of in-between states (accreting but with a low accretion rate) observed in low-mass X-ray binaries in our Galaxy. We find that the accretion disc in PSR J1852+0040 is geometrically thin, with a thickness of $\\sim 10$ times the accretion disc radius, and with a mass distribution that is consistent with a uniform density disc. We discuss the implications of this for the stability of the disc, and find that it is consistent with a relatively long spin-down lifetime of the system. We find that the observed spin-down rate is consistent with the system having been weakly magnetized at birth, and having experienced relatively large torque from accretion in the past. We discuss the implications of this for the low-mass X-ray binary initial mass function, and for the accretion history of the system."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a detailed analysis of the potential of future Type Ia supernova (SN) surveys to constrain cosmological parameters with high precision, using the observed large-scale structure (LSS). We consider the case of a standard Type Ia SN survey which is not designed to extract any information from the LSS, and show that it can in fact be used to constrain the matter density with $\\Delta\\Omega_{\\rm m} \/ \\Omega_{\\rm m} \\sim  1.5\\%$, using $\\sim 100$ SNe. We show that a large improvement can be obtained by adding a LSS analysis to a Type Ia SN survey, and that this would allow to constrain the matter density to $\\Delta\\Omega_{\\rm m} \/ \\Omega_{\\rm m} \\sim 0.1\\%$. We also quantify the optimal use of a SN sample to constrain the LSS parameters $\\delta\\Omega_{\\rm m}$ and $\\delta\\sigma_8$, and show that the optimal analysis is very sensitive to the choice of the sample selection criteria. A simple criterion to select the SNe is to require that they must lie within a given redshift range, and to require that they must be within a given distance from the nearest galaxy. We show that such a simple criterion can already constrain $\\delta\\Omega_{\\rm m}$ to $\\Delta\\Omega_{\\rm m} \/ \\Omega_{\\rm m} \\sim 2.8\\%$, and that this can be improved to $\\Delta\\Omega_{\\rm m} \/ \\Omega_{\\rm m} \\sim 1.3\\%$ if SNe are additionally required to be of high photometric precision.

We finally discuss the prospects of a dedicated LSS survey, which could potentially provide a much stronger constraint on $\\delta\\sigma_8$ than any Type Ia SN survey, by reaching $\\Delta\\sigma_8 \/ \\sigma_8 \\sim 1.5\\%$."}
{"text":"\nWe present a study of the small-scale structure of the 21 cm power spectrum of the intergalactic medium, based on an analysis of the data obtained with the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) telescope. We find that the power spectrum is well described by a two- parameter model, with a cut-off scale of approximately 5-10 Mpc and a power law index of -1.7 \u00b1 0.2. The quality of the fit is improved when a small contribution from a broad component with a power law index of -0.4 \u00b1 0.2 is included. The best-fit parameters are consistent with the small-scale structure being due to turbulence, with a correlation length of approximately 5-10 Mpc. The small contribution from the broad component could be a signature of large-scale flows with a correlation length of approximately 100 Mpc. We show that the data are consistent with the presence of a single power law index in the range of redshifts investigated, despite the large variation in the density of the intergalactic medium. The best-fit model has a correlation length that decreases with increasing redshift, which is consistent with a picture where the turbulence is driven by the evolution of the large-scale structure and the growth of supermassive black holes. We discuss the prospects of using the 21 cm power spectrum to detect the anisotropic shapes of quasar H II regions during reionization."}

We show that this conclusion can be reached without assuming that the Oort cloud is a shell, and hence it is not sensitive to the exact shape of the cloud.

{"text":"\n\nA map of the day-night contrast of the extrasolar planet HD 189733b\n\nWe present photometric measurements of the day-night contrast of the extrasolar planet HD 189733b, as observed with the Hubble Space Telescope. We find that the contrast is very sensitive to the spatial distribution of clouds in the atmosphere. If the clouds are distributed in a ring, the contrast is high and symmetric, but if the clouds are only located near the equator, the contrast is much lower and asymmetric. We have developed a simple model that can reproduce our observations provided that the clouds are located above the equatorial region. This model suggests that clouds form at high latitudes and then move towards the equator. Our results are consistent with a wind field that is aligned with the equator and that has a speed between 5 and 10 m\/s. We also present a map of the surface gravity, obtained from the same observations. The gravity map shows several large continents and many small islands. The distribution of continents and islands is consistent with a scenario in which the planet is rotatingsynchronously."}
{"text":"\n\nWe investigate the problem of a driven multilevel quantum system interacting with a multi-bath reservoir. We analyze the effects of the driving on the dynamics of the system-reservoir interaction, in particular on the achievable degree of coherence of the driven system. In our analysis we take into account the fact that the dynamics of the system-reservoir interaction is typically very fast, while the driving is done on a longer time-scale. Our main results can be summarized as follows. If the driving is sufficiently fast in comparison to the dynamics of the system-reservoir interaction, then the driven system can achieve a high degree of coherence. If the driving is too slow, however, the coherence will be largely destroyed by the fast dynamics of the system-reservoir interaction. We also find that in order to achieve a high degree of coherence the driving field must be optimized in a way that depends on the details of the system-reservoir interaction. Our results are illustrated with a simple example."}
{"text":"\nWe propose a physical model based on the Energy Condition that univocally determines the acceleration of the Universe, without any need of adjustable parameters. Our model requires only the knowledge of the three primary Energy Conditions, the three thermodynamic principles, and the properties of the four fundamental interactions. The model automatically produces the correct value for the acceleration of the Universe, both in the past and in the future, without any adjustable parameters. Therefore, it is a theory without free parameters that determines the evolution of the Universe and the energy conditions in the past and in the future. The only free parameter in the model is the initial value of the energy density of the Universe, to be determined by future experiments. The model also shows that the energy conditions can determine the structure of the Universe, in terms of the distribution of matter and energy in space. Therefore, our model is not only able to determine the acceleration of the Universe, but also the structure of the Universe, without any free parameters."}
{"text":"\n\nWe show that a class of half-BPS Wilson loops in four-dimensional gravity duals to finite temperature field theories have a structure which is related to the structure of the corresponding Wilson loops in the effective N=1 gauge theory. We show that the half-BPS Wilson loops are generated by a set of translation, rotation and an involution operator, which satisfy a set of relations which are analogous to the relations satisfied by the operators generating the BPS Wilson loops in the effective N=1 gauge theory. The only difference is that the half-BPS loops are not in general associated with a spinor field, but only with a \"shadow\" of the spinor field which is related to the spinor field by the constraint that the shadow is always anti-parallel to the spinor field. This shadow spinor field has a well defined structure only in the limit that the number of generations is large. In the N=1 gauge theory the same set of translation, rotation and involution operators generate also the BPS loops in the limit that the number of generations is large.

{"text":"\n\nThe mass assembly history of spheroidal galaxies: did newly-formed systems arise via major mergers?\n\nWe present a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation that is capable of producing the mass assembly history of galaxies in groups and in the field, with a detailed treatment of major mergers. We show that a simple assumption that the mass of a system changes according to a single power law as a function of redshift can accurately describe the mass assembly history of spheroidal galaxies in groups and in the field, provided that the power law has a very low value (that is, the system grows very slowly) for low-mass systems, and that the mass of a system at any given redshift is equal to the mass of the system that is produced by the major merger of two systems with equal masses at the previous redshift. We show that this assumption is consistent with the finding that the major mergers of systems in groups are, on average, less massive than the major mergers of systems in the field. We also show that this assumption is consistent with the finding that the mass of a system after a major merger is, on average, not higher than the mass of the system before the major merger. We discuss various physical mechanisms that may be responsible for the slow growth of low-mass systems, and we suggest that low-mass systems grow primarily through the accretion of gas from the intergalactic medium. We show that the assumption that newly-formed systems arise via major mergers is consistent with the finding that the mass assembly history of a system is well described by a single power law, provided that the power law has a very low value for low-mass systems. We discuss various physical mechanisms that may be responsible for the major mergers of systems, and we suggest that the major mergers of systems are likely to be efficient only for massive systems."}
{"text":"\n\nWe report the detection of an isolated compact object at high Galactic latitude. The object, designated 2MASS J2126, is located in the Galactic halo, 37.2 kpc from the Sun. The object has a radius of 1.4 \u00b1 0.2 R\u2299, a mass of 2.2 \u00b1 0.3 M\u2299, and a Galactic latitude of  \u2212 0.86 \u00b1 0.01. These properties suggest that 2MASS J2126 is a solitary Wolf-Rayet star. The solitary nature of this object makes it a very useful laboratory for studying the structure and evolution of Wolf-Rayet stars. We estimate the age of the object to be around 6 kyr, which is much younger than the typical age of the Galactic globular clusters, and we discuss this fact in the context of the formation history of the Galactic halo. We find that 2MASS J2126 has a low metallicity, [Fe\/H] \u2243 +0.6, which is similar to that of the Galactic globular clusters, but lower than the average metallicity of the Galactic disc. A possible explanation for this is that the star was formed in the Galactic disc and has since migrated to its current position in the Galactic halo. We estimate the orbital eccentricity of the object to be  \u2243 3.7, which implies that the object has never been a member of any of the Galactic globular clusters. We discuss the possible formation mechanisms for a Wolf-Rayet star in isolation."}
{"text":"\nTracking User Attention in Collaborative Tagging Communities\n\nWe present a comprehensive framework for analyzing user attention in collaborative tagging communities.

Our framework includes several measures of user attention, including a measure of the intensity of user attention and a measure of the spatial distribution of user attention. We apply our framework to the analysis of user attention in the collaborative tagging community of flickr, and we use our results to investigate the relationship between user attention and the evolution of the flickr tagosphere.

{"text":"\n\nWe present a detailed statistical study of the occurrence and properties of jet-breaks in the X-ray light-curves of 17 Swift-observed Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) with well-defined afterglows. We find that the probability distribution of the number of jet-breaks is well described by a power law with a exponential cut-off, P(nb| AJ)=\u03b1-nb\/A, where P(nb| AJ) is the probability of having nb jet-breaks with amplitude AJ, \u03b1 is the power-law index and A is the cut-off amplitude. We also find that the occurrence of a given number of jet-breaks is independent of the burst duration. In addition, we find that the distribution of the jet-breaks amplitudes is also well described by a power law, P(AJ| nb)=\u03b1JA, where AJ is the amplitude of the jet-breaks and JA is the amplitude of the first peak of the light-curve, if any. We show that these results can be explained by a simple model in which the jet-breaks are due to the interaction of the relativistic jet with the surrounding medium, in a similar way as the first peak of the light-curve. The only free parameter of the model is the jet velocity, which we estimate from the observed distribution of the jet-breaks amplitudes. We find that the simplest model which is able to reproduce the observed statistics is one in which the jet velocity is constant and equal to the sound speed in the surrounding medium. In this case, the jet-breaks occur at a fixed distance from the burst centre, and the power-law index of the jet-breaks amplitude distribution is directly related to the sound speed. We discuss our results in the framework of simple models for the relativistic jet propagation in an inhomogeneous medium."}
{"text":"\n\nWe introduce and study a generalization of the concept of angle between subspaces from the finite-dimensional to the infinite-dimensional setting. We show that any such angle is expressible in terms of the dimensions of the subspaces and their projections on each other. Furthermore, if the angle is acute, the subspaces have a common basis. We apply our results to solve the problem of computing the extreme rays of a ray class in terms of the ( possibly infinite) basis of the ambient space. This in particular gives a simple formula for the number of extreme rays in terms of the dimension and the cardinality of the basis. As an application, we give a description of the set of all invertible operators on a Hilbert space in terms of angles between subspaces. In particular, we show that an operator is invertible if and only if the angle between its range and the whole space is acute. We also give a description of the set of all operators that commute with a given self-adjoint operator on a Hilbert space in terms of angles between subspaces. As an application, we show that an operator is concave if and only if the angle between its range and the whole space is obtuse."}
{"text":"\nWe present here the results of a comprehensive study of the high-energy threshold reaction rates on a 0.8 GeV proton-irradiated thick Pb target. The main goal of the work is to establish the viability of using such an irradiated target as a source of high-energy X-rays in an X-ray generator. The study consists of measurements of the X-ray yield as a function of the accelerating voltage in an X-ray tube using such a target and of the resulting high-energy threshold reaction rates. We observe a clear and strong peak in the X-ray yield at an accelerating voltage of 60 kV. The corresponding threshold reaction rate is 1.5 \u00b7 10-6 cm2s-1. We also find that the threshold reaction rate increases rapidly with the accelerating voltage, in spite of the fact that the nuclear reactions that are responsible for the X-ray emission become less and less efficient as the proton energy increases. This is explained by the fact that at high accelerating voltages the tube geometry becomes more and more favourable for the emission of high-energy X-rays. We discuss our results in the framework of a simple theoretical model, according to which the X-ray yield is related to the nuclear track density in the target. We estimate the track density in our target and find that it is in reasonable agreement with our model predictions."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider matter density perturbations in two-component models of modified gravity that are able to reproduce the evolution of the effective gravitational constant, $\\Gamma_{\\rm effective}$, and the matter power spectrum, $\\alpha_{\\rm matter}$, as functions of redshift in a way consistent with the standard model of cosmology. We find that the effective density field is always in local thermal equilibrium (LTE) with the matter power spectrum, $\\alpha_{\\rm matter}$, whatever the values of the model parameters. We then use the assumptions of local thermal equilibrium and a flat matter power spectrum to derive a simple formula for the matter density perturbations in the effective theory.

{"text":"\nWe present several cache-oblivious arrangements of points in a square grid that yield nearly-optimal packing density. The arrangements are derived by iteratively adding points to a set of points that are already packed as tightly as possible. This is achieved by first identifying a largest empty circle in the existing layout and then placing a new point at the center of this circle. The process is iterated until no empty circles can be found. The resulting layouts are within a small constant factor of the optimal density achievable by a fully-dynamic algorithm that places points greedily. The constant factor depends on the grid dimensions and the number of points, but is roughly two for large grids. For example, in a 10,000-point layout on a grid of 100 by 100, the achieved density is approximately 99.8%. We also present a nearly-optimal algorithm for evolving an initial guess for a cache-oblivious layout into a local optimum. The algorithm uses a series of hill-climbing steps, where the number of steps is guaranteed to be small."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a comparative study of the accretion outbursts of the black hole microquasars XTE J1550-564 and H 1743-322. These objects were observed with the Chandra X-ray Observatory and the Rossi-Berger Spectrograph on the basis of a simultaneous observation campaign using these two instruments. We find that the accretion outbursts of both objects are well described by a power law with a negative power law index. The accretion outbursts of H 1743-322 are, on average, one order of magnitude more powerful than those of XTE J1550-564, indicating that the accretion disc of H 1743-322 is more efficient in transporting accreted material to the black hole than the disc of XTE J1550-564. The observed phenomenology of accretion outbursts in both systems is consistent with a radiative efficiency of $\\sim10^{-3}$.

The vehicle will be used to navigate rough, uneven terrain and thus will be subjected to severe conditions. The design is based on the concept of a slide-o-cam, which is a device that converts linear motion into rotary motion. The slide-o-cam is a component of the transmission that is mounted on the input shaft. The slide-o-cam is designed to move axially along the input shaft, thereby providing the correct ratio between the input shaft and the output shaft. The transmission is designed to have a variable ratio between the input shaft and the output shaft, which will allow the vehicle to travel at different speeds. The transmission is designed to have a high ratio, which will allow the vehicle to travel at a high speed. The transmission is designed to have a low ratio, which will allow the vehicle to travel at a low speed. The transmission is designed to have a reverse ratio, which will allow the vehicle to travel in reverse. The transmission is designed to have a neutral ratio, which will allow the vehicle to be in neutral.

{"text":"\nWe propose a methodology for the design of parallel kinematic machine tools based on the use of kinetostatic performance criteria. The motivation for this work is the difficulty in designing and analyzing the behavior of parallel kinematic machine tools based on conventional kinematic performance criteria, due to the complex non-linear relationship between the kinematic and kinetostatic characteristics. The proposed methodology is based on the use of a parameter called the \"kinetostatic defect\", which represents the deviation of the actual kinetostatic characteristics of a machine from the desired ones. The kinetostatic defect is related to the work actually performed by the drive motors, and is calculated using the concept of virtual work. By defining a functional relationship between the kinetostatic defect and the conventional kinematic performance criteria, the design of parallel kinematic machine tools can be simplified. The proposed methodology is demonstrated by means of an example."}
{"text":"\nWe propose a modification to the covariant density functional theory (CDFT) that enables the treatment of small vibrations in the presence of a finite array of point-like scatterers. The motivation for this work is the problem of particle-vibration coupling in photonic crystals, where the oscillations of the semiconductor lattice are driven by the presence of acoustic waves, and the resulting lattice vibrations scatter light. We show that the standard CDFT Hamiltonian is ill-defined when the array of scatterers is finite, because the expansion in the basis of the reciprocal space is incomplete. Our modification remedies this problem by introducing a finite basis set of non-periodic reciprocal space functions that are in one-to-one correspondence with the finite array of scatterers. Within this basis set, we can expand the reciprocal space- bathecd field in a complete set of orthogonal functions that are in general not eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian. The use of this general basis set enables us to evaluate the two-particle correlation functions, and to quantify the effect of the vibrations on the transport properties of the system. We show that our method is applicable to both finite and infinite systems."}
{"text":"\n\nWe conjecture the exact solution of 3D simple orthorhombic Ising lattices by using the frustration of Ising model on square lattice. In the 3D simple orthorhombic Ising lattices, the frustration is much stronger than in the 2D simple square Ising lattices. The strong frustration is caused by the non-zero frustration elastic constants $\\alpha_{ij}$ in the 3D simple orthorhombic Ising lattices, while $\\alpha_{ij}=0$ in the 2D simple square Ising lattices. Therefore, the exact solution of 3D simple orthorhombic Ising lattices is more difficult than that of 2D simple square Ising lattices. The main difficulty of the exact solution of 3D simple orthorhombic Ising lattices is to find the ground state (GS) with exact solutions. The standard scheme to find the GS with exact solutions is to use the martingale method. In this paper, we show that the GS with exact solutions of 3D simple orthorhombic Ising lattices cannot be found by using the martingale method. Then we propose another scheme to find the GS with exact solutions of 3D simple orthorhombic Ising lattices. Finally, we show that our proposed scheme is also not able to find the GS with exact solutions of 3D simple orthorhombic Ising lattices."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a method for determining the size, mass, and density of exomoons from photometric transit timing variations. We consider a lens system in which a planet and its exomoon are transiting in front of two stars. If the light curves of the two stars are observed with high enough precision, the exomoon's transit will be visible as a timing variation in the planet's transit. From the shape of the transit timing variation, we can infer the exomoon's density. Because the exomoon's radius can be deduced from the width of the transit timing variation, and the mass is the product of the radius and density, we can also determine the exomoon's mass. We present a practical approximation for the transit timing variation that can be used with current and near-future high-precision transit data. We also discuss a model in which the lens system is a double-line-blurring planet, and show that the method is most sensitive when the lens system is almost perfectly focused. We find that exomoon masses can be determined with a precision of about 1%, without requiring an a priori assumption about the exomoon's density. We apply our method to the analysis of exomoons detected in the last decade, and find that the assumption of a constant exomoon density is consistent with the data for all of the exomoons, but that the data are most consistent with an exomoon density of about 1.5 times the density of Earth. We also present a new detection method for exomoons that makes no a priori assumption about the exomoon's density."}
{"text":"\nWe consider the problem of stationary relativistic jets in a homogeneous and isotropic hydrogenous intergalactic medium, with no infall or outflows in the vicinity of the jet. We find that a relativistic jet can give rise to various types of chromohydrodynamic instabilities, provided that the bulk velocity of the jet is large enough. The most interesting of these is the so-called Alfv\u00e9n rotor, which is a limit cycle instability that leads to the evolution of the jet into a supersonic tornado-like structure. This instability is driven by a feedback between the bulk velocity of the jet and the bulk velocity of the ionized gas that surrounds the jet. We show that this feedback process is self-limited, and that the growth rate of the instability is inversely proportional to the thickness of the shear layer between the relativistic jet and the bulk medium. We also show that the rotor is a spherically symmetric solution, and that it therefore is axisymmetric with respect to the jet. This has important implications for the stability of the rotor, as well as for its physical interpretation."}
{"text":"\nWe consider the problem of distribution of the normalized earning rate (Earnings over Productivity) of firms in the middle scale region around the world.

We obtain a simple and consistent formula for the variance of the log-normal earning rate distribution. We also propose a simple empirical test to verify whether the firm's earning rate follows a log-normal distribution in the middle scale region. Our results suggest that the firm's earning rate is well described by a log-normal distribution in this scale region, and this finding has important implications for understanding the mechanism of firm's earning and the theory of the firm."}
{"text":"\n\nWe show that the spacetime metric can in principle be obtained from cosmological observations, in particular from the observed large-scale structure of the universe and from observations of the cosmic microwave background. We discuss two methods, one based on the Karplus-Ress paradox and the other on the Analytics method ofCharacterizing the universe. We show that in both cases the resulting spacetime is a critical de Sitter space-time with a piecewise constant scalar curvature and that in both cases the pieces have the same scale. The resulting spacetime is not spatially flat but has a special form of a positive scalar curvature, the so-called constant scalar curvature. In the case of the Analytics method, the constant scalar curvature is de Sitter spacetime, while in the case of the Karplus-Ress method, the constant scalar curvature is a piece of a de Sitter space-time with a bounded radius. We show further that in both cases the full spacetime can be recovered by a procedure which amounts to a change of variables in the Karplus-Ress method and to an integration in the Analytics method. We also comment on the relationship to the cosmological constant problem."}
{"text":"\nWe study the dynamics of a wetting film of a superfluid on a solid substrate in the presence of an external potential field. We show than non-zero fluctuations of the superfluid order parameter can have a critical effect on the wetting film dynamics, leading to a breakdown of theWetting Film Hypothesis, according to which the film velocity is equal to the substrate velocity at the contact line. We find a different dynamic behavior for the wetting film in the presence of a zero-mean field and a non-zero-mean field, which can be relevant in a number of different physical systems, such as in the presence of a uniaxial field, or in the case of a wetting film on a textured surface, or in the presence of an impurity in the film. We also found a different dynamic behavior for a wetting film in the presence of a field with a non-zero variance, which can be relevant in the case of a wetting film on a substrate with a very rough surface, or in the case of a film which is not strictly two-dimensional, for example in the case of a film on a substrate with a relief."}

{"text":"\n\nWe develop low-temperature and high-temperature approximations for the statistical mechanic of fluids composed of penetrable spheres. Theseapproximations are shown to capture the essential features of the system, and are used to study the transition from the low-temperature to the high-temperaturephase. A simple model in which the radius of the spheres is taken to be proportional to the thermal length is used to determine the dynamic structure factor andthe specific heat. The accuracy of the low-temperature approximation is shown to be very good, provided that the thermal length is not too small. The high-temperatureapproximation is less accurate, but is still useful for fluids with very large thermal lengths. The low-temperature approximation is used to derive an integral equationfor the dynamic structure factor. The high-temperature approximation is used to obtain a simplified version of this integral equation. Both integral equations are shownto be in good agreement with Monte Carlo simulations, over a wide range of volume fractions."}
{"text":"\nWe report on a new method for precise measurements of radio-frequency (RF) magnetic susceptibility in (anti)ferromagnetic materials. The RF susceptibility is a measure of the magnetic response of a material to an external alternating magnetic field. It can be used to characterize the dynamic properties of magnetic materials and to study their interaction with spin-currents. We focus on the characterization of the RF susceptibility in a paramagnetic state, i.e. when the material is not thermally excited, in order to probe the static magnetic properties of the material. Our approach combines a static magnetic field, which aligns the spins in the material, with an RF field, which excites the transient spin-currents. We show that, despite the smallness of the induced transient spin-currents, the RF susceptibility can be measured with high precision, provided that the static magnetic field is known with high accuracy. We demonstrate the feasibility of the method by measuring the RF susceptibility of a (close to) fully ordered antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on a square lattice. Our results show that the RF susceptibility is extremely sensitive to the static magnetic field, with a variability of about 3% per Tesla."}

{"text":"\nWe present a new model for the evolution of supermassive black hole binaries and the acceleration of the relativistic jets in galactic nuclei. We solve the orbital and rotational evolution of a supermassive black hole binary, taking into account the gravitational waves emitted by the system and the accretion torque exercised by the secondary on the primary. We show that the orbit of the secondary can be stable, provided that the mass of the secondary is larger than a critical value, which depends on the black hole mass and the distance from the black hole. We then couple our model to the three-dimensional hydrodynamic equations for the evolution of the accretion disk and the relativistic jet, taking into account the energy conservation and the dynamics of the disk and the jet. We solve the coupled system and study the effects of the secondary on the evolution of the disk and the jet. We find that the precession of the secondary can produce a significant increase of the energy in the jet, if the initial energy in the disk is small. Our results suggest that a supermassive black hole binary can produce a powerful relativistic jet even in the absence of an accretion disk around the primary, provided that the secondary is massive enough."}
{"text":"\nWe propose a new model of cell colony growth based on a hybrid cellular automaton, which takes into account both the local stochastic updates and the long-range dependencies. We investigate the effect of the range parameter on the dynamics of the model and we find that two different regimes can be identified, characterized by different sizes of the colonies and different growth rates. We find that the most efficient strategy for the growth of the colonies is to start from a small range and then increase it gradually. We also find that the small size colonies, if they survive, grow faster than the large size ones, thus contributing to the size distribution. Our analysis shows that the growth of the colonies is self-organized critical, in the sense that the ranges of the updates are optimal for the growth of the system, and that the most probable range is in between the critical one and the optimal one. We show that the critical range can be obtained from the derivative of the growth rate with respect to the range. The optimal range can be obtained from the derivative of the efficiency with respect to the range. We analyze the dynamics of the colonies in a competitive environment and we find that the range of the updates is an important factor for the survival of the colonies."}
{"text":"\n\nWe study information feedback and mass media effects in cultural dynamics. We present a formal model of a cultural entity (a social system) and an information system (mass media). The model allows us to study the dynamics of the social system and the mass media on each other. We consider two types of mass media: the traditional mass media, which is \"transmitted\" (i.e. newspaper, television), and the \"new\" social media, which is \"retrieved\" (i.e. internet). We show that the traditional mass media is a \"monoculture\" that has a global impact on the social system, while the social media is a \"polyculture\" that has a local impact on the social system. We analyze the information feedback from the social system to the mass media and we study the different regimes of the information feedback. We show that the information feedback is positive (i.e. the social system reinforce the mass media) if the mass media is close to the \"mainstream\" of the social system, and the information feedback is negative (i.e. the social system refuses the mass media) if the mass media is far from the \"mainstream\". We study the dynamics of the social system and we analyze the role of the mass media in this dynamics. Finally, we study the problem of the \"switch\" of the social system from one mass media to another. We show that the \"switch\" can be provoked by the mass media only if the new mass media is close to the \"mainstream\" of the social system."}
{"text":"\nWe present here results of a systematic numerical study of the effect of magnetic fields on the formation and evolution of circumstellar discs around young stars. Our numerical code solves the hydrodynamic equations for a chemically homogeneous and isotropic disc, in the presence of a radial magnetic field. We find that the magnetic field has two competing effects on the disc. On one hand, it tends to contract the disc, because of the Lorentz force acting on the plasma flow. On the other hand, it tends to prevent the disc from contracting, because of the magnetic pressure acting against the compression of the magnetic field lines. These two effects are balanced in a stable configuration, which depends on the strength and the direction of the magnetic field. When the disc is unstable, we find that the physical effects of the magnetic field tend to prevent it from contracting. However, the magnetic pressure does not increase as the disc contracts, because the magnetic field lines are not compressed. Therefore, an unstable disc will be able to contract only if the Lorentz force is large enough to overcome the increasing resistance of the magnetic pressure. We have studied the effect of the temperature gradient, the chemical composition and the velocity field on the stability of the disc. Our results show that the magnetic field has a strong effect on the dynamics of the disc and may prevent its contraction in many cases. We also find that the discs which are able to contract are those which are able to develop strong internal torques."}
{"text":"\nWe present an analytic model that describes the effect of the relative orientation between the coronal field and new emerging flux on the global properties of the solar corona. We find that the consideration of the relative orientation is important for a consistent description of the observations. We consider two cases in our analysis: the emergence of small-scale flux and the emergence of large-scale flux. In the case of small-scale flux, we find that the model without the consideration of the relative orientation is in agreement with the observations only for igen < 4.5 kG\/m^2. In the case of large-scale flux, we find that the consideration of the relative orientation is important to describe the observations, independently of the strength of the field. We also analyze the importance of the detailed balance between the expansion and the contraction of the corona for the evolution of the global properties of the solar corona. We find that an unbalance in the energy budget can produce significant changes in the structure and evolution of the corona. The unbalance can be produced by a non-zero net flux emergence rate, by an incorrect consideration of the relative orientation between the coronal field and the new emerging flux, or by an incorrect consideration of the relative importance of the expansion and the contraction of the corona. We discuss the relevance of our results for the interpretation of observations and for the understanding of the solar corona."}
{"text":"\n\nA New Tool for Seismology--the Cumulative Spectral Power.\n\nWe introduce a new measure of seismic activity, based on the cumulative spectral power, which we name the \"cumulative spectral moment.\" This measure has several attractive features, including the property that it is decorrelated with the location, size, and orientation of the fault system. We show that the cumulative spectral moment is related to the familiar moment magnitude scale, but the relationship is very weak, which makes the cumulative spectral moment a more robust measure of seismic activity. We find that the cumulative spectral moment has a clear inverse relation with the rate of moment release, which we show is a consequence of the physical relation between the seismic moment and the energy radiated by the Earth's vibrations. We point out that the conventional seismic moment is not a good measure of activity because it is very strongly correlated with the size and orientation of the fault system. We show that the cumulative spectral moment has several other interesting properties, including a strong tendency to increase in bursts, a tendency to have a power law distribution on long time scales, and a linear relation with the amount of energy released by the seismic events. The cumulative spectral moment has several practical applications, including as a way to detect activity that is not visible on other moment measures, as a way to identify different seismic sources, and as a way to study the dynamics of the moment release."}
{"text":"\nWe present observations of the shallow decay phase of 25 GRB afterglows in the U band (3200-3700 \u00c5), in the N band (5200-5700 \u00c5), and in the Z band (9500-9800 \u00c5). We find that the time-integrated afterglow flux in the U band is well described by a power law with a photon index of 1.5 \u00b1 0.2 and a break time of 150 \u00b1 100 ks. We find a similar power law in the N band with a slightly higher photon index of 1.9 \u00b1 0.3 and a break time of 100 \u00b1 100 ks. The afterglow in the Z band decays as a single power law with a photon index of 1.1 \u00b1 0.3 and a break time of 130 \u00b1 70 ks. We model the afterglow decay with a simple model in which the wind bubble contracts and the afterglow is emitted from a single point. We show that the model can reproduce the observed afterglow decays well, and we discuss the physical interpretation of the parameters. We find that the power law indices in the N and Z bands are somewhat higher than would be expected if the afterglow were emitted from the center of the bubble, and we discuss several possible physical explanations for this. We also discuss the physical origin of the relatively rapid decay in the U band."}
{"text":"\nWe show that monotonicity and stability are not, in general, closely related for solutions of hyperbolic conservation laws with source terms. We give conditions for which they are equivalent, and discuss the relation between monotonicity and stability for solutions of the steady-state equations.

We also show that a solution of a steady-state equation is stable if and only if the solution is a constant or if the solution is equal to the solution of the associated homogeneous equation plus a term that is a linear combination of the solutions of the homogeneous equation with the coefficients in the convex basis of the solutions of the homogeneous equation.

We consider several different burst triggers, both standard and advanced, and several different instrumental artifacts, including clipping and momentary inhibition of either detector. We find that the effect of instrumental artifacts can be quite large, in some cases comparable to the effect of the background noise, and we present a simple expression for the probability of a false alarm in a given time interval, which can be used to derive the optimal alarm threshold for a given false-alarm rate. We also discuss the effect of the duration of the artifact, the time between the two artifacts (if any), and the signal-to-noise ratio of the background noise. We conclude with a detailed analysis of a realistic artifact model, including the effects of background noise, and we compare the results with the predictions of the simple model."}
{"text":"\n\nDetermination of intrinsic switching field distributions in perpendicular recording media: numerical study of the $\\Delta H(M, \\Delta M)$ method\n\nThe demand for higher areal density and faster data transfer rate in hard disk drives has resulted in the development of new magnetic recording methods, such as perpendicular recording. In contrast to the conventional longitudinal recording, the magnetization in perpendicular recording is perpendicular to the disk surface, which allows for a much higher linear bit density. The practical consequence of this is that the magnetization of the recording media, in general, does not strictly follow the superposition principle. The superposition principle states that the magnetization in a ferromagnetic material is the vectorial sum of all previous magnetizations. In longitudinal recording, this is strictly true, in perpendicular recording, it is not. Therefore, the interpretation of magnetic measurements on perpendicular recording media requires a model that describes the statistics of the intrinsic, unwanted magnetization of the media. We have developed such a model, which we call the $\\Delta H(M, \\Delta M)$ method. The basic idea of the $\\Delta H(M, \\Delta M)$ method is to determine the switching field distribution from the statistics of the first and second order derivatives of the magnetic field with respect to the magnetic field. We have verified the $\\Delta H(M, \\Delta M)$ method by comparing the results of our numerical calculations with experimental results obtained by our colleagues. We have also performed a detailed study of the effect of the anisotropy constant on the statistics of the intrinsic magnetization."}
{"text":"\nWe consider the focusing of high-energy particles in the electrostatic field of a homogeneously charged sphere in the limit of small sphere radius and high particle energy. The basic properties of the corresponding stochastic differential equation are investigated. It is shown that this equation has a diffusion term that depends on the second time derivative of the solution and a stochastic term that contains a small parameter. The exact solution of the equation is obtained in the limit of small stochastic term. It is shown that the effective momentum approximation is applicable to this equation. The solution of the corresponding effective stochastic differential equation is obtained and the small parameter is eliminated from it. The resulting solution is analytic and takes the form of a certain rational function of the initial data. The roots of this function have a special structure and can be calculated analytically. The first special root is a regular boundary layer and the second special root is a soliton-like solution. The corresponding dynamical processes in the electrostatic field of the homogeneously charged sphere are investigated. The boundary layer solution has a compression and rarefaction of the corresponding stochastic field and a gradual change of the polarity of the field. The soliton-like solution has a fast (therefore energy-carrying) component and a slow (therefore energy-absorbing) component. The behavior of the corresponding effective particles is investigated. We show that the energy of the effective particles is concentrated in the small sphere and the energy is converted into the heat. We also show that the effective momentum approximation is valid in the case when the thermal energy is much smaller than the kinetic energy of the effective particles."}

{"text":"\nWe present a study of the correlations of the electric charge, as measured by the longitudinal polarization P, in relativistic heavy ion collisions at the SPS energies. We show that these correlations are rapidity dependent and that they are very well described by a three-dimensional (3D) correlation function that depends only on the rapidity difference between the two interacting nuclei and on their total energy, independent of the particular kinematic variables used to describe the collision. This implies that the basic mechanism of the correlations is the same in all the different collisions we have studied. The shape of the correlation function, as well as the energy dependence of the correlation length, are in good agreement with a simple model in which the correlations are due to the creation of a jet of expanding correlation functions in the direction of the relative motion of the nuclei. A different model, based on the creation of a string, gives a somewhat better description of the energy dependence of the correlation length, especially at small values of the rapidity difference, but it fails to describe the shape of the correlation function. Our results are consistent with the basic mechanism of the charge correlations being due to the expansion of a correlation jet, but they also suggest that the detailed structure of the correlations is affected by the string-like nature of the collision. We also present a study of the energy dependence of the cross-correlations of the charge correlations with the longitudinal polarization P and with the transverse polarization T. We find that the cross-correlations with P are in agreement with the simple jet model, but the cross-correlations with T are not. We discuss various possible explanations for this disagreement, and we suggest that the most likely explanation is that the energy dependence of the structure functions for T is not yet properly accounted for in the theoretical descriptions."}
{"text":"\nWe present a theoretical study of the structure and properties of one- and two-component bottle-brush polymers in good solvent, in the limit of large brush height and small number density of macromolecules. The key ideas and methodology are: (i) the description of the polymers' structure by the mean-field theory in the basis of the nearest-neighbor approach, (ii) the assumption that the polymer conformers are tightly packed and fully overlapping, (iii) the calculation of the spatial and orientational correlations, and (iv) the use of the conformational space generated by these correlations for the construction of the configurational trees and the computation of the statistical properties. We compare our theoretical predictions with the results of computer simulations of two recently proposed algorithms for the simulation of bottle-brush polymers in good solvent, which are based on the representation of the brush by a two-level hierarchical tree and on the assumption that the solvent molecules are much more numerous than the polymer molecules. In particular, we show that both algorithms give good predictions of the radial distribution function, if the brush height is large enough, independently of the number density of macromolecules. We also show that the prediction of the configurational tree obtained by the two-component algorithm is in a very good agreement with our theory, if the number density of the polymer is not too large. We discuss the limitations of the simulation algorithms in the description of the bottle-brush structure in the limit of large number density of macromolecules and small brush height."}
{"text":"\n\nWe study the general properties of quantum zero-knowledge proofs. We show that quantum zero-knowledge proofs can be seen as a generalization of non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs to the setting of quantum computation. As a fundamental example, we construct a quantum zero-knowledge proof system for any language in NP using only (advice for) quantum circuit families. We show that this construction can be viewed as a generalization of the Nisan-Wigderson trick to the quantum setting. As a consequence, we obtain that every language in NP has a quantum zero-knowledge proof system, provided that there exists a quantum circuit family for the language. We also show that this conclusion can be obtained using only (advice for) quantum channels. As another result, we show that if there exist quantum zero-knowledge proofs for languages in NP, then the polynomial-time assumption can be removed from the security definition of quantum zero-knowledge proofs. We show that our results imply the possibility of quantum zero-knowledge proofs for the average case of languages such asppled Marilyn or OWin, for which there is currently no (known) efficient classical proof."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider the problem of finding a good approximation to the ground state of a system with a large number of degrees of freedom, in the case that the dynamics can be described by a Markovian evolution, and the system is able to be in several states with the same energy. The ground state is then obtained as the state with the minimal number of particles. We show that such a ground state can be obtained as the result of a stochastic process, with the number of particles in each state being given by a random variable that follows a binomial distribution. The key point is that the expected value of this random variable is minimal, which implies that the system is likely to be found in the state with the minimal number of particles. We also show that the algorithm for this ground state approximation has a simple probabilistic interpretation, and that the algorithm can be made exact in the case that the initial state has the minimal number of particles in each state. The resulting ground state approximation is shown to be very close to the true ground state for a number of simple examples."}
{"text":"\nWe present model-independent constraints on the reionization history of the IGM from large-scale CMB polarization measurements. The primary aim is to test the consistency of the theoretical predictions of several models in a regime where the polarization P(k) is sensitive to the reionization history, but the underlying physics is relatively insensitive to the precise details of the model. We show that if the shape of the P(k) spectrum is well described by a damped inverse power law, then the contribution to P(k) due to reionization is in tension with the predictions of several prominent reionization models. We evaluate the significance of this result in the context of a simple physical model which allows us to assess the relative importance of model-dependent and model-independent effects. We also investigate the implications of our result for theories which assume that the shape of the P(k) spectrum is well described by a plateau, and we conclude that such theories are in better agreement with the data, although the agreement is still not particularly good. We also present a model-independent constraint on the ionization transition scale, derived from the assumption that the reionization of the IGM is described by a single power law. We show that this constraint is consistent with the predictions of most reionization models, but that it is in tension with the predictions of models which assume that the IGM is gradually reionized by a series of small perturbations."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider standard forms of multimode Gaussian states which are suitable for both single and multi-qubit quantum information processing under local operations. Such states are engineered by a sequence of local operations and quantum measurements on a conventional quantum register, and can be understood as a generalization of the idea of quantum error correction to the case of multimode quantum information. We show that in the case of a qubit (i.e. a two-mode) quantum register, the set of standard forms coincides with the class of states which are simultaneously robust against quantum errors and have a minimal number of quantum bits, in the sense that the entropy is minimal among all states with the same robustness.

We also comment on a generalization of our results to the case of an arbitrary number of modes."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a catalogue of 75 galaxies identified as Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) at z~5 from an imaging survey with two 8k x 8k cameras covering a field of 1.3 sq. deg. from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. The galaxies were selected using a proprietary algorithm based on their rest-frame UV colours and the locations of known LBGs in the local volume at z~1-2. We present their locations, morphological classifications, and rest-frame UV colours. These galaxies are candidates for further spectroscopy, to measure their line-of-sight velocities and hence to probe the kinematics of the intergalactic medium at this epoch. Our sample is almost uniform in rest-frame UV colour, with a median colour of +0.06 in the rest-frame U-V colour-magnitude diagram. The galaxies are typically slightly bluer in colour than the local LBGs at z~1-2, and the vast majority have colours typical of galaxies in the early stages of formation. We discuss the properties of the galaxies in the sample, and in particular, we show that the sample contains a higher fraction of bright galaxies than the local LBG population, in agreement with the fact that the galaxies in the local LBG sample are known to be more distant galaxies in the local volume at z~1-2. We also show that the galaxies in our sample are preferentially found in the same regions as the local LBGs, but that they tend to be somewhat further away from the galaxies in the local LBG sample. This implies that the local LBG population at z~1-2 is not a random sample of all the LBGs in the local volume, but is instead a sample of the closest LBGs to us."}
{"text":"\nWe present a class of f(R) cosmic acceleration models that evades solar-system tests. We show that these models can reproduce the observational data that is used to constrain the parameters in a general f(R) model, without requiring the parameters to be constrained in the manner that is usually assumed. In other words, these models can produce the correct accelerating universe without the requirement that the scale factor, the derivative of the scale factor, or the second derivative of the scale factor must be constant throughout the history of the universe. The class of models that we consider contains as a special case the standard f(R) model in which the second derivative of the scale factor is constant, but also includes models in which the second derivative is not constant. This class of models is not ruled out by solar-system tests, and therefore it could provide a possible explanation for the observed accelerating universe if the observations are not sensitive to the second derivative."}
{"text":"\n\nHost Galaxy Bulge Predictors of Supermassive Black Hole Mass\n\nWe present a study of the correlation between the mass of a supermassive black hole (SMBH) and the properties of the bulge of the host galaxy in which the SMBH resides. We use a sample of galaxies in which the SMBH mass has been measured through reverberation mapping. We find a correlation between the SMBH mass and the surface brightness of the bulge, the concentration of the bulge, and the average distance of the bulge from the center of the galaxy. The correlation is found to be significant at the 1\u03c3 level for the surface brightness and the concentration, and at the 3\u03c3 level for the average distance. We show that the correlation for the surface brightness is consistent with the assumption that the SMBH mass depends only on the accretion rate of the SMBH, and that the correlation for the concentration and the average distance is consistent with the assumption that the SMBH mass depends only on the velocity dispersion of the SMBH. We discuss the implications of our findings for future SMBH mass measurements."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider the problem of applying perturbation theory to a system that includes a parameter that varies discontinuously, and in particular, a system in which the parameter experiences a sudden jump. We show that the standard approach to perturbation theory, which consists of writing the solution as a power series in a small parameter, breaks down in this setting. We then propose a modified perturbation theory, which we call parametric perturbation theory, that remedies this shortcoming. This approach is based on the idea of performing a systematic expansion in a parameter that is related to the discontinuity. This expansion is shown to be a generalization of the WKB method to the setting of a discontinuous parameter. The theory is applied to the problem of a charged particle moving in a field that undergoes a sudden jump. We show that the solution to this problem is a special case of a general class of solutions to the Dirichlet problem for the Laplace equation with a parametric right-hand side."}

We run the model for several initial conditions and for different mass for the dark matter in the two galaxies. For all the runs we monitor the total number of particles, and the distribution of particles in the two galaxies after the collision. We found that the total number of particles is reduced in the collision, and we observe a clear difference in the distribution of particles in the two galaxies, with more particles in the trailing galaxy.

{"text":"\nWe present a systematic study of nonleptonic two-body B-decays in hadron collisions, including the final state with two mesons of the same species in the decays of B mesons to charmonia states and also in the final state with an axial-vector meson in the decays of B mesons to jet final states. The former is motivated by the recent observation of the X(3900) meson in hadron collisions, while the latter is motivated by the question of the mechanism of the production of the first strange hadron in hadron collisions and the structure of the corresponding final state. We show that the theoretical framework of the so-called standard model (SM) concept of weak matrix elements can be used to evaluate the relevant weak amplitudes in both cases. In particular, the contributions of the various weak gauge bosons to the amplitudes can be evaluated in a unified way within the framework of the SM. We evaluate the relevant amplitudes for the relevant B meson decays and compare the theoretical predictions with the available experimental data. We also briefly discuss the theoretical implications of our results for the structure of the final states with two mesons of the same species and with an axial-vector meson."}

We show that the Landau levels are well described by a three-band model that includes the spin-density-wave and the s-wave as well as the previously predicted 3\/2-dimensional topological defect states. We determine the Landau levels from a systematic dependence of the conductivity on the magnetic field in a wide temperature range below the charge-transport transition temperature, T_c. The order parameter of the Landau levels is found to be equal to the square of the Chern number of the 3\/2-dimensional defect state. Our results suggest that the Chern number is a universal topological invariant of a large class of semimetals, including the entire family of group-VI semimetals (as well as some group-V semimetals) with a non-centrosymmetric structure. \n\nWe have also determined the bulk conductivity of the non-conductive state by measuring the resistivity as a function of temperature for a large range of magnetic fields applied along the easy direction in the magnetic field. Our results show that the resistivity has a minimum as a function of temperature, in strong contrast to the traditional metallic behavior, and that this minimum is directly related to the 3\/2-dimensional topological defect state."}
{"text":"\nWe report on a search for muon neutrinos from northern hemisphere gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) with the AMANDA detector. We find no evidence for a signal and set a limit on the muon neutrino fluence from GRBs in the northern hemisphere. The limit is 1.2 cm^2 at 50 km distance for bursts with a fluence of 1 kcm^2 and an energy distribution with a peak energy of 100 keV. We use a simulation to study the response of the detector to a burst and find that for a burst to be detectable with a signal larger than the background, it has to occur within a few tens of kilometers from the detector. We discuss possible reasons for our failure to observe a burst and conclude that the most likely explanation is that bursts simply do not occur in our neighborhood. We also discuss a search for a burst signature in the data from the Rome Observatory neutron monitor and find no evidence for a signal. We combine our results with previous searches to obtain a search radius as a function of energy and find that the area with a search radius larger than the known burst radius is very small. We conclude that the northern hemisphere is unlikely to host any burst sources that are detectable with current technology and argue that an extensive search in the southern hemisphere is probably the best way to find a burst source."}
{"text":"\n\nHot Nights on Extrasolar Planets: Mid-IR Phase Variations of Hot Jupiters\n\nWe present the results of a photometric study of mid-infrared phase variations of hot Jupiters. We observed three planets using the Differential Imaging Coronagraphy (DIC) technique with the NASA\/IPAC Extrasolar Planet Observatory (EPO), a 1 m-diameter telescope equipped with a mid-infrared camera (IBM\/IRST) at the NASA Infrared Processing Facility. For the planet HD 209458 b, we detected a non-negligible signal variation of up to 1.7% in photometric noise equivalent magnitudes over a 3-day period. This corresponds to a phase variation of up to 4.3%, assuming a perfectly spherical planet with no atmosphere. We estimate the scale height of the atmosphere to be between 11 and 20 km, corresponding to a pressure scale height of between 3.4 and 5.5 kPa. We estimate the relative optical depth of the atmosphere to be  log(O\/F) = 1.5 \u00b1 0.1. We conclude that the atmosphere of HD 209458 b is optically thick, with a relative optical depth larger than that of the Earth (log(O\/F) = 1). The mid-IR phase variations of the two other observed planets, HD 197658 b and HD 20988 b, are too small to be detectable with the DIC technique. We estimate the scale height of the atmosphere of HD 197658 b to be in the range of 10-20 km and the pressure scale height to be in the range of 4-6 kPa. The corresponding relative optical depth is estimated to be in the range of log(O\/F) = 0.5-1. For HD 20988 b, we estimate the scale height to be in the range of 8-16 km and the pressure scale height to be in the range of 2-4 kPa. The corresponding relative optical depth is estimated to be in the range of log(O\/F) = 0.3-0.7. We discuss our results in the framework of simple atmospheric models. We show that mid-IR phase variations can be used to constrain atmospheric models of hot Jupiters."}
{"text":"\nWe consider the problem of constructing improved hard-sphere ground-state equations of state (GSEs) for use in computer simulations of hard-disk systems. We review the basic method for constructing such equations, which consists of (i) an exact determination of the low-energy structure and (ii) a subsequent fitting of a simple functional form to the computed pair potentials. We show that this method has several limitations, and we propose two general strategies for overcoming them. The first strategy involves fitting to the exact energy per particle, rather than to the simpler pair potential. The second strategy is to use a large number of reference systems, which are diverse in the details of their low-energy structure, in order to extract a generic form of the GSE that is relatively insensitive to the specific details of the low-energy structure. We illustrate these general strategies by considering several specific examples, and we provide a quantitative assessment of the improvements that are obtained."}

{"text":"\nWe have developed a microscopic theory of asymmetric superconductivity in metallic systems, which are capable of supporting both a normal conducting state and a superconducting state at different temperatures. The theory describes the temperature dependence of the superconducting transition temperature, the superconducting gap and the density of states in a wide range of metallic systems, including heavy fermion and organic superconductor materials. The theory is based on a simple microscopic model, which is capable of describing the essential features of the superconductivity in these materials, including the finite temperature dependent transition temperature, the finite superconducting gap and the density of states with very broad states. The model successfully predicts the temperature dependence of these quantities in a wide range of metallic superconductors, including the well studied heavy fermion superconductors and the less well studied organic superconductors. The successful prediction of the temperature dependence of the superconducting properties in these materials, which was not possible within the framework of the conventional theory of superconductivity, is an important example of the fruitful application of the renormalization group approach to the theory of superconductivity. The theory also suggests a possible mechanism of the formation of the large scale superconducting order, which is based on the collective motion of the charge carriers on the elementary bonds."}

{"text":"\nWe study the cosmological dynamics generated from a (super)string effective action with higher order curvature corrections and a dynamical dilaton. In our model, the bulk dynamics is described by a five dimensional anti de Sitter bulk with a positive cosmological constant, while the four dimensional effective action is described by a bulk with a dynamical dilaton and a cosmological constant which can be either positive or negative. The effective action can be obtained from the bulk effective action by integrating out the bulk dimensions. We find that the resulting effective action is non-minimally coupled to gravity. We show that this effective action can generate a universe with a positive cosmological constant which is either constant in time or time dependent, with a possibility to get a transition from a universe with a positive cosmological constant to a universe with a negative cosmological constant. The possible presence of a positive cosmological constant in our model is in agreement with the recent observations of the accelerated expansion of the universe. The transition from a positive to a negative cosmological constant is in agreement with the recent observation of the accelerating and decelerating expansion of the universe. We also show that the effective action in our model generates a de Sitter bulk with a negative cosmological constant which is in agreement with the observations of a very early universe with a small radius and a large cosmological constant. Our model can be considered as a model with an additional parameter which describes the bulk dynamics. The bulk dynamics generates the accelerating and decelerating expansion of the universe and can be related to the recent observations of the cosmic microwave background and the large scale structure formation."}

{"text":"\n\nWe consider a simple model of a sequential process with a binary choice and study the impact of measurement noise on the resulting Markov process. The model is inspired on the choice of a policy-maker, which at each step can choose between two alternative actions, and the choice is made sequentially and independently at each step, with the knowledge of the previous steps. We assume that the choice at each step is informed by some random variable, and that the observation of this variable is noisy. We find that the long-term behavior of the process is affected by the measurement noise in a way that depends on the amount of noise and on the number of alternatives. In particular, we find that the noise may have two opposite effects: it can either increase or decrease the number of visits to the worst state. We also find that the long-term behavior of the process can be described in terms of the excess of visits to the best state with respect to the visits to the worst state. We show that this excess can be interpreted as a random walk, whose step-size is related to the measurement noise."}
{"text":"\nWe present a detailed study of the impact of ion clearing electrodes (ICEs) on the beam dynamics in the DAFNE electron microscope. We show that the ICEs influence the spatial profile of the transmitted electron beam in a complex way, which depends on the configuration of the ICEs as well as on the incident electron energy. We find that the ICEs can be configured in a way that the spatial profile of the transmitted electron beam is stabilized against spatial instabilities in the incident electron beam. By using a Prony analysis we show that the transmission properties of the ICEs can be described by a damped harmonic oscillator. Furthermore, we find that the configuration of the ICEs has a strong influence on the energy distribution of the transmitted electron beam. We show that the energy distribution of the transmitted electron beam can be described by a Boltzmann distribution, which is modified by a non-linear terms that is proportional to the inverse of the transmitted beam current. The latter effect is explained by a model, where the electron beam is considered as a current source, which is biased by the electric field that is generated by the ICEs. We also discuss the influence of the ICEs on the spatial and energy distribution of the scattered electron beam."}
{"text":"\n\nRate Adaptation for Cognitive Radio under Interference from Primary Spectrum User\n\nSpectrum scarcity has led to the development of cognitive radio (CR) techniques that enable secondary users to opportunistically access spectral bands allocated to primary users. If the primary user is not utilizing its allocated spectrum, the secondary user can utilize this spectral resource without interfering with the primary user's transmission. However, if the primary user is utilizing its allocated spectrum, the secondary user's transmission will interfere with the primary user's transmission. In this paper, we study the impact of such interference on the secondary user's rate adaptation process. We propose a rate adaptation algorithm that accounts for the impact of interference from the primary user on the secondary user's transmission. The proposed algorithm is evaluated through simulations and it is shown that the algorithm achieves near-optimal performance in terms of the secondary user's rate."}
{"text":"\nWe present a direct and general method to calculate the interfacial tension between two liquids from a computer simulation. Our method is based on the measurement of the bending energy of freely jointed chains of hard spheres placed at the interface. The accuracy of the method is assessed by comparing the results with those obtained from extensively validated molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of several systems of interest, such as the surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) in water and the protein bovine serum albumin (BSA) in water and in the presence of SDS. We show that, in good agreement with previous theoretical and experimental results, our method correctly predicts the variation of the interfacial tension with the molecular weight of the proteins or the chain length of the surfactants. We also analyze the effect of the pH in the case of the protein BSA in water, and we find that our results are consistent with the trend expected from the protonation state of the protein, in qualitative agreement with experimental data. Finally, we present a simple model that relates the interfacial tension with the concentration of the species in the mixture in a good agreement with the results obtained with our method."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present photometric observations of the young star OO Serpentis between 1995 and 2006. During this time, the accretion outburst which had begun in 1989 decayed, then resumed with a peak in 2001, and finally returned to its quiescent state. We find that the accretion rate was relatively constant during the quiescence, but that it increased abruptly at the start of the outburst. The accretion rate was higher during the first year of the outburst than in the subsequent years. We interpret these results in terms of a model in which the accretion torque on the donor is balanced by the magnetic torque from a magnetic accretion disc around the donor. We discuss the efficiency of the accretion process by comparing our observations with predictions from the model. We find that the accretion efficiency is relatively low, and that it does not decrease monotonically with accretion rate, as expected from the model. We suggest that the low accretion efficiency may be due to the fact that the accretion disc is not strongly magnetized."}
{"text":"\nWe review the neighborhood of the Standard Model (SM) in the framework of a relativistic theory with three generations of non-degenerate coupled fermions. The structure of the model is motivated by the requirement that the quark-lepton number be preserved and that the mass of the third generation fermions be small compared to the mass of the second generation fermions. We determine the masses and the mixing angles of the three generations of fermions in a model-independent way by considering the two-point function of a fermionic field with a second fermionic field which is non-relativistic and (approximately) neutral. The computation of the relevant matrix elements is facilitated by a particular structure of the non-relativistic field. The mixing angles are small compared to the Standard Model and the quark-lepton number is preserved. The model has a Yukawa structure which is invariant under a field redefinition. This structure can be related to a two-row representation of the Lorentz group. We show that the representation is the unique extension of a representation with a single row to a representation with two rows which is invariant under the field redefinition. This represents an example of a new kind of relativistic model which is motivated by quark-lepton number conservation and which is in the neighborhood of the Standard Model. We discuss possible physical implications of our results."}
{"text":"\nWe present a stray-fields-based magnetoresistance mechanism in a novel magnetic-optical nanocomposite of Ni80Fe20-Nb-Ni80Fe20 trilayers. We show that a significant magnetoresistance signature is obtained from the sample under a magnetic field applied perpendicular to the plane of the film, most probably due to the induced circular stray fields in the nonmagnetic Nb layer. The stray fields, in turn, are found to originate from the magnetic field induced helical structure in the magnetic Ni80Fe20 layers. We explain the nature of the helical structure by considering the stress-induced strain in the magnetic films in conjunction with the strain-field coupling. We also analyze the detailed structure of the magnetic domains by means of magnetoscope measurements in a magnetic field applied parallel to the plane of the film. Our results demonstrate the interplay of different stray fields in a nanocomposite magnetic-optical film and provide a stray-fields-based magnetoresistance effect that could be useful for spintronic applications."}
{"text":"\nWe present a method for testing different models of the evolution of the number of hydrogen atoms in the intergalactic medium via the analysis of the cosmic flux decrement. Our method is based on the comparison of the predictions of different models regarding the stochastic absorption of the light of background sources (i.e. galaxies, groups of galaxies and clusters). We found that the recent line-number evolution models based on the cooling of the gas temperature and the virialization of the matter give very good agreement with the observations, provided that the matter is distributed according to the Universal Late Time (ULT) distribution. The ULT distribution is characterized by a very large scale structure (i.e. the superclusters) in which matter is nearly stationary, and by very small scale structures in which matter is virialized. Our results suggest that a simple model of matter distribution in which the matter is equally distributed in the small scale structures (i.e. the virialized matter) and the large scale structures (i.e. the non-virialized matter) is in good agreement with the observations."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider stochastic interacting particle systems out of equilibrium. We review the general theory of such systems and present some new results on an important special class of such systems, namely, the stochastic particle systems with elastic interactions and internal degree of freedom.

We show that these systems have very rich statistical equilibrium behavior which can be very different from the equilibrium behavior of the corresponding equilibrium system. In particular, we show the existence of a new type of phase transition which is absent in the equilibrium case. As an application, we consider the statistical equilibrium of a new model of active particles which interact via elastic collisions and have an internal degree of freedom. We show that this system has a rich phase diagram which includes a new type of phase transition, namely, a phase transition between a disordered state and a state with long range order.

{"text":"\n\nIGR J17254-3257, a new bursting neutron star\nWe present the discovery of a new member of the class of low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs), a system we name IGR J17254-3257. This system is a close binary containing a magnetic white dwarf with a hot spot and a neutron star. The white dwarf is stealing material from the neutron star, producing X-rays and a burst of relativistic electrons. The system is the second (and closest) member of the class of LMXBs known as cemetery spirals. The nature of the accretion process is such that the system can be considered a low-mass version of a supersoft X-ray source. We estimate the white dwarf's magnetic field to be on the order of 10 MG, much stronger than the 1 MG field previously thought to be necessary to explain the observations of the only other member of this class, Vela X-1. We find that a relatively long-duration burst of X-rays, of order of 100 ks, occurred on 2005 December 14. The burst was accompanied by a burst of relativistic electrons (termed a \"antypenumbra\") that decayed rapidly from its peak to a few thousand electron volts in just seven hours. The burst was also accompanied by a significant brightenings in the high-energy tail of the X-ray spectrum, possibly due to pickup of non-thermal particles in the white dwarf's hot spot. The X-ray and optical data show that the accretion process is highly inefficient, with the white dwarf stealing only 0.01% of the neutron star's orbital moment. The inefficiency of the process suggests that the neutron star is rotating extremely rapidly, and we estimate its spin rate to be between 2.2 and 3.4 seconds. Our results also suggest that the accretion process in low-mass X-ray binaries is driven by the magnetic field of the white dwarf."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a quantum-like representation of extensive form games that generalizes the quantum representation of normal form games. Our main result is that the new representation is inequivalent to the standard representation in the sense that a strategy that is optimal in the standard representation may not be optimal in the quantum-like representation and vice versa. We show that the new representation can be obtained from the standard representation by introducing an auxiliary game that has a fully specified (nonempty) set of strategies. The auxiliary game is a wine testing game, which we analyze in detail. We show that the quantum-like representation of the wine testing game is equivalent to the representation obtained by replacing each strategy in the standard representation by the set of all strategies in the auxiliary game that are consistent with the original strategy. We also show how to use the quantum-like representation to solve the wine testing game. Finally, we indicate how the quantum-like representation can be applied to other extensive form games."}
{"text":"\nWe show that a noncommutative generalization of the Bohnenblust-Spitzer identity for Rota-Baxter algebras satisfies Bogoliubov's recursion. The motivation for this research is that Rota-Baxter algebras are now well-developed theoretical objects, but their relationship to the standard Bogoliubov recursion is not known. The key ideas and methodology are that we need to show that the noncommutative B-S identity satisfies a certain recursion relation, and then we can use this to prove the main result. The results obtained are that the noncommutative B-S identity does satisfy Bogoliubov's recursion. This gives a noncommutative analog of the standard Bogoliubov recursion, which may have applications in quantum mechanics. The problem work attempts to solve is to prove that the noncommutative B-S identity satisfies Bogoliubov's recursion. This has not been done before. The practical applications of this research are that it provides a new way to study the noncommutative generalization of Bogoliubov's recursion, which may have applications in quantum mechanics. The theoretical applications are that it provides a new way to study the relationship between Rota-Baxter algebras and Bogoliubov's recursion. This could have implications for future research in the theory of Rota-Baxter algebras and the theory of Bogoliubov's recursion."}
{"text":"\n\nLongitudinal data are ubiquitous in the biomedical sciences. A typical design involves repeatedly measuring the same variables over time on the same units. In some cases, however, the number of measurements per unit is strictly limited, and a unit may drop out of the study for some periods. We refer to such designs as history-restricted. The primary examples are longitudinal studies of tumor growth, where due to ethical constraints, the number of measurements per patient is limited. In this work, we consider the problem of causal inference in history-restricted longitudinal studies. In particular, we consider a class of models called marginal structural models, which is a promising approach for longitudinal causal inference that has been extensively used in the context of intensive longitudinal data, where the number of measurements per unit is large. We propose an extension of the marginal structural model framework to handle history-restricted longitudinal data. Our approach relies on the idea of borrowing information from the past to inform the model about the underlying causal structure. We show that our approach is feasible and provides consistent estimates of the model parameters. We demonstrate the practical usefulness of our method by applying it to a real-world dataset of tumor growth."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a study of the X-ray properties of galaxies in the X-ray selected Star Forming Galaxies (XSFG) survey, an extension of the Deep X-ray Image (DX) survey, in order to probe the relationship between star formation and accretion activity. We find that the X-ray emission from star-forming galaxies is dominated by a low-mass population (log Mgas < 9.5 kpc^2), with an X-ray luminosity distribution that is consistent with a power law with a cutoff at Lx < 4.5 kpc^2. The total X-ray emission from star forming galaxies in our sample is less than the optical star formation rate, indicating that the X-ray luminosity is dominated by accretion events. We show that the fraction of X-ray emission due to accretion events increases with galaxy mass and that a simple model in which the accretion rate scales as the inverse square of the orbital period can explain the observed trends. We also find that the X-ray colors of the XSFGs are well described by a power law with a slope of -1.06 \u00b1 0.07 and an intercept of 1.64 \u00b1 0.13 k\u00c5, which is consistent with the results of the DX survey. These results suggest that the accretion and star formation processes are tightly coupled in galactic nuclei."}
{"text":"\nWe study the discrete thermodynamics of lasers, i.e. the statistical thermodynamics of the underlying discrete many-body system. In particular, we study the general equilibrium of such systems, characterized by the fact that the statistical distribution of the discrete degrees of freedom remains stationary as time evolution is performed by means of an external driving. Such equilibrium has a simple form in the limit of a large number of degrees of freedom. We show that such equilibrium is in general strictly stable with respect to small perturbations of the system, in the sense that the statistical equilibrium is recovered with an exponential speed from any initial condition close to the equilibrium. We analyze the simplest example of such a laser, the so-called ponderomotive laser, and show that such a laser in general has a broad spectrum which is in general very difficult to control. We also derive a simple expression for the radiant intensity of such a laser, in terms of the aforementioned equilibrium. We then discuss possible physical realizations of discrete thermodynamics lasers, and analyze the conditions under which the aforementioned stability holds. In particular, we show that a true discrete thermodynamics laser will in general be in a highly unstable equilibrium, and that the only way to achieve a stable operation is to use a feedback mechanism which controls the laser dynamics in such a way that the equilibrium is approximately recovered. We finally comment on the possible implications of our results on the thermodynamics of continuous variables lasers, and on the statistical thermodynamics of general many-body systems."}

{"text":"\nWe consider massive gravity in the regime where the asymptotic speed of propagation of gravity waves is less than the speed of light. Such a regime can be found by using an auxiliary field theory in which the massive gravity is described by a gauge theory with a non-minimally coupled vector field. In this formalism the massively gravity is effectively described by a pure gravity theory with a structure constant which takes a negative value and with a non-vanishing cosmological constant. This description has a clear physical interpretation: massive gravity is described by an effective four-dimensional theory which contains a two-dimensional gravity theory with a structure constant taking a negative value and with a non-vanishing cosmological constant, coupled to a two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory with a non-minimally coupled vector field. We show that this effective theory describes the same physical system as the massive gravity in the regime where the asymptotic speed of propagation of gravity waves is less than the speed of light. We then use this effective theory to study the early structure formation in the universe. We find that the massive gravity structure formation is different from the pure gravity structure formation, and the massive gravity structure formation is described by a simpler model in which the evolution is determined by the two-dimensional gravity theory with a structure constant taking a negative value and with a non-vanishing cosmological constant."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a set of guidelines for the interpretation of observations of aligned interstellar grains in a fiducial model that consists of a known initial alignment distribution, a known boundary condition at the ISM-ellar medium interface, and a known grain growth and alignment distribution function. We show that due to projection effects the observed alignment distribution will depend on the observational direction relative to the alignment distribution in the bulk, on the grain boundary condition, and on the grain growth rate. We evaluate the uncertainties in the derived alignment parameters and discuss the prospects of detecting deviations from a fiducial model. Our results indicate that a statistically significant detection of a significant deviation from a fiducial model is only possible if the observed grain boundary condition deviates significantly from a 'perfect' boundary condition, or if the growth rate is significantly different from the fiducial growth rate. We also derive a formula for the limiting error in the derived alignment parameters as a function of the observation duration, and we discuss the prospects of using observations of grain alignment for probing the properties of the interstellar medium."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a new framework for the analysis and synthesis of developmental systems. We focus on systems where the dynamics of the cells are largely non-linear and the interactions between cells are complex, such as in embryonic development or in the nervous system.

We propose a general methodology for identifying robust developmental programs, which can robustly generate the full range of phenotypes observed in the system. We show that these programs are closely related to the concept of a developmental attractor, a subspace of developmental states where the dynamics are attracted to the normal development and where small perturbations do not significantly change the developmental outcome. We apply our framework to several examples, including the development of the vertebrate skeleton, the development of the central nervous system, and the evolution of developmental programs."}
{"text":"\nWe present the results of a detailed analysis of the large-scale structure of galaxies, as determined from the power spectrum and bispectrum of galaxy positions. We show that a simple model in which galaxies are influenced only by Newtonian gravity, with a cosmological constant to account for the observed large-scale structure, can quantitatively reproduce the power spectrum and bispectrum, provided that the strength of nonlinearity is included as a free parameter. We then use this model to set limits on the non-Newtonian corrections to the galaxy distribution. If the non-Newtonian corrections are too large, the power spectrum is too steep at large scales and too flat at small scales. If the corrections are too small, the power spectrum is too flat at large scales and too steep at small scales. We show that these limits can be used to set a simple upper bound on the non-Newtonian corrections of O(1%) for power spectrum deviations and O(10%) for bispectrum deviations, with a confidence level of 95%. We also present numerical results for a model in which the galaxies are influenced by a cosmological constant and a small-scale repulsion, with a strength proportional to the inverse cube of the distance. The model is able to reproduce the data as well as the Newtonian model, with a small non-Newtonian correction (O(0.5%) for the power spectrum and O(1%) for the bispectrum). We discuss these results in the framework of recent numerical studies."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider finite-size scaling of the resistivity in directed percolation in the steady state. We show that the standard deviation of the resistivity, defined as the square root of the variance, scales as the crossover function of the percolation transition, which implies that the standard deviation is universal, both in dimension and in the range of connectivity. In contrast, the mean resistivity does not scale as the crossover function, but rather as the derivative of the crossover function at the percolation transition. We show that the non- universality of the mean resistivity can be understood by considering the underlying critical percolation cluster, which is characterized by a finite number of connections. The variance is then shown to be the finite-size scaling of the number of connections in the critical cluster. Our results are consistent with the theory of directed percolation in the steady state, recently proposed by Berenstein andizard [Berenstein, I. R., and Zirnbauer, P. R., Europhys. Lett. 74, 904 (1999)]."}
{"text":"\nThe Stellar Population And Origin Of The Mysterious High-Latitude Star Forming Cloud CG 12\n\nWe present photometric and spectroscopic observations of the high-latitude star forming cloud CG 12. We find a minimum of three stellar objects in the cloud. Two of these are known to be protostars, but the third has high-contrast optical jets, indicating that it is a young stellar object as well. The average spectral type of the three stars is M1.5. This is inconsistent with the ages implied by the kinematics of the cloud, which are ~2\u20133 million years. We propose two possible resolutions to this discrepancy. First, the three stars could have formed simultaneously, in which case the kinematics would be an accurate measure of the age. This is unlikely, however, because the cloud is small and the stars are widely separated, so that they would have to have formed at roughly the same time in order to share a common kinematic history. A more likely explanation is that the three stars are not the only stars to have formed in the cloud, but that the others have since been hidden by the interstellar medium. This would bring the kinematic age in line with the spectral type, and would also explain why the three stars are distributed roughly evenly between the two sub-clouds that make up CG 12. We estimate that there must be at least one more star in the cloud, and possibly as many as five or six. This suggests that the number of high-latitude star forming clouds may be underrepresented in the galaxy, and that they may play a larger role in star formation than is currently thought."}
{"text":"\n\nWe investigate the dynamics of bright and dark soliton complexes in spinor Bose-Einstein condensates. We consider both one-dimensional and two-dimensional systems. The motivation for this work is to gain a better understanding of the different ways in which such soliton complexes can be excited and to study their behavior once they are excited. We find that in a one-dimensional system, a pair of bright solitons can be excited by first exciting a single soliton and then making it collide with a second soliton that is coupled to the first one. The two bright solitons then continue to propagate in the BEC, creating a bright soliton pair. We also find that such a pair can be created by exciting a single dark soliton and then making it collide with a bright soliton. The two solitons then propagate as a bright-dark soliton pair. In a two-dimensional system, we find that a bright soliton pair can be created by exciting a single bright soliton and then making it collide with a second soliton that is coupled to the first one.

{"text":"\n\nPlanetary embryos and planetesimals residing in thin debris disks\n\nWe present a model of planet formation that is consistent with the general properties of the solar system, the architectures of individual planetary systems observed in exoplanet surveys, and the limited number of planetesimals observed in the solar system. Planets form by the gravitational collapse of gas and dust clouds. This process is inefficient and can produce planetary embryos with a wide range of masses. Our model contains three phases: a slow accretion phase, a rapid accretion phase, and a final growth phase. In the slow accretion phase, the growth rate is only 10-fold per lifetime, and the mass of the embryos is small. This phase corresponds to the pre-solar nebula. The rapid accretion phase lasts for about 10 million years, and the mass of the embryos grows by a factor of 10 every 10,000 years. The rapid accretion phase is triggered by the formation of a protoplanet, and is associated with a runaway accretion process. Our model produces a wide range of masses for the embryos in the rapid accretion phase. The final growth phase is triggered by the encounter between embryos. The encounter produces a torque that increases the orbital velocities of the embryos, and results in a separation of the embryos with different masses. We show that the number of planetesimals is proportional to the number of planets. This proportionality is consistent with the limited number of planetesimals observed in the solar system."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff for large multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. In contrast to the conventional wisdom, we show that the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff does not exhibit a universal worsening trend as the number of antennas is increased. In fact, we show that this tradeoff can be optimized by a simple multiplexing-centric strategy, which is independent of the number of antennas. Our results provide an asymptotic analysis of the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff in large MIMO systems and has several practical implications. For example, it suggests that, in large MIMO systems, designing specific codes to achieve full diversity is not necessary, which is in sharp contrast to the conventional wisdom. We also show that the standard code designs, such as the ubiquitous Gilbert-Elliott (GE) codes, can be highly sub-optimal for large MIMO systems. Finally, we show that large MIMO systems can achieve better diversity-multiplexing tradeoff than small MIMO systems, if the large MIMO systems use the same number of independent channels as the small MIMO systems. In other words, increasing the number of antennas does not always make the MIMO system worse."}
{"text":"\nWe present photometric and spectroscopic observations of the optical and X-ray transient 4C 74.26, which has been reported as a possible member of the new class of black-hole\/neutron-star binaries, the so-called X-ray transient binaries (XRBs). We find that the system is a member of the optical class of low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs), with the donor star having a spectral type earlier than G5. We show that the observed phenomenology is consistent with a simple model in which the accretion disc is the dominant X-ray source, with a hot spot at its inner edge, in a steady-state configuration. The X-ray excess observed during the transient event can be explained by an inner accretion disc and an outer disc, with the inner disc being optically thick and the outer disc being optically thin. The accretion disc model can account for the observed phenomenology without the need to invoke a different X-ray production mechanism for the transient event, as proposed in some previous works. We discuss the limitations of the model and the predictions for future observations."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider the problem of determining the optimum allocation of transmission power to the data streams in a Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) communication system. We propose a novel scheme that achieves the maximum possible throughput by jointly optimizing the MIMO detection and channel codes. Our scheme is based on the idea of allowing the soft-detections to be noisy, and hence, the detection errors are corrected by the channel codes. To minimize the detection errors, we maximize the minimum eigenvalue of the Fisher information matrix, which is the derivative of the detection error with respect to the transmission power. We show that the proposed scheme is an attractive alternative to the conventional power allocation strategies, especially when the channel is deep-faded and the number of receive antennas is large. simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves a close to optimal performance, and significantly outperforms the conventional schemes in a severe channel environment."}
{"text":"\n\nWe investigate the degree optimization and stability condition for the min-sum decoder. In the design of an LDPC decoder, it is well-known that the number of variable node processing elements (VPEs) is determined by the number of variable nodes in the graph and the number of check nodes is determined by the number of check nodes in the graph. The degree of each VPE (the number of connections to a VPE) has to be large enough to achieve the optimal throughput, but not too large to exceed the physical limitation. In this paper, we study the problem of determining the optimal degree for a VPE. We show that for a VPE with fixed number of ports, the optimal degree is achieved when the number of incoming edges is equal to the number of outgoing edges. We also show that the overall performance of an LDPC decoder does not necessarily improve by increasing the degree of a VPE beyond the optimal degree. We further show that the stability condition for a min-sum decoder is equivalent to the condition that the number of outgoing edges is at most one more than the number of incoming edges. Our results provide a general framework for designing efficient decoders for belief propagation-based probabilistic graphical models."}
{"text":"\n\nLayered quantum dimer magnets are model systems that can be used to study the interplay between the geometric frustration induced by the non-collinear magnetic interactions and the exotic states induced by the quantum fluctuations. In this work, we study a class of layered quantum dimer magnets in which the different magnetic layers are coupled in a non-hierarchical manner. In particular, we consider a model that is equivalent to a three-layer quantum dimer magnet, with the middle layer being the only non-hierarchical one. We find that this model is in a thermodynamic steady state, and that it is frustration-free in a large portion of the magnetic phase diagram. We show that this frustration-free state is characterized by an inhomogeneous condensate of magnetic charges, with a different charge density in each layer. We analyze the frustration-free state by means of a frustration metric, and show that it is very close to the fully frustration-free limit. Our results suggest that, in general, non-hierarchical coupling of magnetic layers can be a route to frustration-free quantum dimer magnets, although in some cases it may be equivalent to a hierarchy of layers."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate the energy dependence of the transport parameter and the phenomenon of parton saturation in relativistic heavy ion collisions from the point of view of a simplified microscopic model. The model consists of a lattice with a quark-gluon plasma (QGP) and a thermalized gas of lorentzian fragments, both interacting with each other and with the lattice. The model is analyzed by a numerical solution of the resulting Boltzmann equation. The energy dependence of the transport parameter is in qualitative agreement with the data of the Heavy Ion Russia (HIR) Collaboration, although our approach does not take into account the energy dependent QGP evolution and the strong anisotropy of the collisional dynamics. We show that the energy dependence of the transport parameter can be well described by a power law with an index of about 2.5. Our results for the saturation effect are in agreement with the HIR data, if the energy dependent evolution of the QGP is included in the description. We find that the anisotropy of the collisional dynamics is a crucial factor to describe the energy dependence of the transport parameter."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present far-infrared imaging of 25 strong CaII-absorber galaxies at z~1 selected from the Two Micron All Sky Survey. These galaxies are potential candidates for the strong emitters in the deep-infrared, and follow-up observations are needed to identify the dust-emitting galaxies. We describe an imaging algorithm that uses the high-resolution spectral data from the Multiband Imaging Photometer for Spitzer (MIPS) to distinguish galaxies in the strong CaII-absorber sample. We find that 17 of the galaxies in our sample are dust-emitting galaxies at z~1. The dust-emitting galaxies have MIPS colors typical of galaxies in the local Universe, but they are significantly dustier, as measured by the MIPS derived total dust mass, than galaxies in the local Universe. The strong dust-emitting galaxies are more likely to be disc galaxies, and are more likely to be face-on, than the weak dust-emitting galaxies. We discuss several of the strong dust-emitting galaxies in more detail, and describe follow-up observations of these galaxies with the Spitzer Space Telescope."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider the difference in the Casimir force acting between two identical neutral plane-parallel slabs, one of which is coated with a thin non-absorbing dielectric layer, and its application to the problem of detecting transparent dielectric layers. The difference in the Casimir forces between the two slabs is due to the difference in the electromagnetic polarizability of the boundary surface, which is related to the dielectric constant of the coating layer. We calculate the difference in the Casimir force between the two slabs, for a dielectric layer with a large dielectric constant, for a dielectric layer with a small dielectric constant, and for a layer of SiO2 with a dielectric constant that is between the two slabs. We also calculate the transmission through the two slabs for a normally incident electromagnetic wave, for a wave incident at the Brewster angle, and for a wave incident at the critical angle. We find that the difference in the Casimir force between the two slabs is large enough to be easily detectable with a sensitive force gauge, and that the force is proportional to the square of the dielectric constant of the dielectric layer."}
{"text":"\nWe present a multi-wavelength analysis of 18um-selected galaxies in the AKARI\/IRC monitor field towards the North Ecliptic Pole. We find that the 18um-selected galaxies are statistically consistent with the general population of galaxies in the field, in terms of their color, surface brightness, and surface-area distribution. We also find that the 18um-selected galaxies are on average slightly less blue, and have higher surface brightness, than the galaxies selected by other far-infrared colors. These results suggest that the 18um-color selection is efficient in finding galaxies with strong far-infrared emission lines, but the selection is slightly conservative, as the 18um-selected galaxies contain somewhat less faint galaxies. We present an automated method to measure the far-infrared line luminosity of the 18um-selected galaxies, and use this method to search for high-redshift galaxies with the line luminosity of interest. We find four galaxies with a relatively high far-infrared line luminosity. One of these galaxies is likely at a high redshift (z >> 5), while the other three galaxies are at intermediate redshift (z < 5). We discuss the nature of these galaxies, and find that the high-redshift galaxy may be a distant galaxy with a high star formation rate, while the three intermediate-redshift galaxies are likely local galaxies with a low star formation rate but with strong molecular lines."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider the question of whether a bound state solution can be isolated from a single horizon in higher-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity. This question is motivated by a recent suggestion that a similar scenario may occur in higher-dimensional general relativity. To answer this question, we first show that such isolation is not possible in five dimensions, using a horizonic bulk solution with an everywhere regular horizon. In higher dimensions, however, the bulk solution can be regular only on a subset of the bulk. We show that for any such bulk solution, there exist vector fields which are divergently extensive on the bulk but whose flux through the horizon is always zero. These vector fields prevent the formation of a bound state. We also consider a variant of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity in which the Ricci scalar is replaced by a \"curvature scalar\" which is defined on the bulk but not on the horizon. In this case, we show that the bulk solution is not necessarily regular on the bulk, but that an isolated bound state solution can nonetheless be formed."}
{"text":"\nWe introduce the concept of a quantum Markovian subsystem, a subspace of a quantum state space that is invariant under a general class of surjective maps, and show that such a subsystem is characterized by a nonempty set of quantum Markov processes, a generalization of Markov processes to the quantum setting.

We show further that quantum Markovian subsystems are related to the concept of a quantum Markov attractor, a subspace of a quantum state space that is attractive for a general class of quantum Markov processes. We introduce a procedure to construct a quantum Markov attractor from a quantum Markovian subsystem and show that quantum Markov attractors are invariant under a natural class of LOCC. As an application, we show that quantum Markov attractors can be used to provide a procedure for approximately solving a class of optimization problems."}
{"text":"\nWe present a comprehensive analysis of the properties of the shallow decay segment in Hideyoshi's spectroscopic survey of the Swift\/XRT data. We find that the observed phenomenology is consistent with a diverse set of physical origins for this decay segment. In particular, we find that the observed correlations of the shallow decay segment with other transient features are consistent with a large number of physical origins, including solar flares, eruption of magnetic flux from the solar interior, and shocks and instabilities in the solar convection zone. We show that a simple model in which the decay segment is generated by an annular distribution of Alfv\u00e9n ion cyclotron (AIC) instability is consistent with many of the observed correlations, but that this model is unable to reproduce a key correlation which is observed between the depth of the shallow decay segment and the length of the transient event. We discuss a number of physical mechanisms which might produce this correlation, including the effects of a constant magnetic field on the evolution of the instability and the effects of a distribution of kinetic energy among different harmonics of the instability. We show that a model in which the shallow decay segment is produced by a superposition of two or more distinct physical processes can reproduce all of the observed correlations, and we discuss the physical conditions which would allow these processes to occur together."}
{"text":"\n\nBlack hole mass estimates from soft X-ray spectra\n\nWe present a new method for estimating the mass of a black hole from its soft X-ray spectrum. Our method combines an updated version of the powerful)*(1) Ripple method with the widely usedmajority* *Consideration method. The main improvement is that our method does not require an explicit treatment of the special relativity contribution to the X-ray photon momentum. We show that our method is more reliable in the low-mass X-ray binary mass regime where the currentdetermination method has important limitations. We also derive an empirical relation between the accretion efficiency and the black hole mass, which can be used to estimate the black hole mass in the high-mass X-ray binary mass regime. We demonstrate the potential of our method with a detailed application to a hard X-ray transient source, 4U gemstone. We show that the current determination method gives an incorrect black hole mass estimate for this source, due to its peculiar accretion properties, but our method gives a consistent mass estimate in agreement with other independent estimates."}
{"text":"\n\nWe study a dynamic screening model in a two-species asymmetric exclusion process. The model consists of an assembly of distinguishable particles in one degree of freedom subjected to three different types of processes, each of which is associated with a particular species. The first species has the ability to create new particles, the second species can only destroy particles, and the third species has the ability to exchange particles with the first one. The main difference between this model and the standard screening model is that the local concentration of the first species is not constant but depends on the total concentration of the other two species. We find that, depending on the initial conditions and the values of the parameters, different species can be in the state of dynamic equilibrium, i.e. the net number of particles of that species does not change with time. Our results show that the standard form of the dynamic screening model, recently proposed in the context of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics, is not suitable to describe the dynamics of multi-species systems with asymmetric interactions."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a new low-mass satellite of the Milky Way, discovered by the Gaia spacecraft. This object, which we name \"Bootes,\" has a Galactic orbit inclined at an angle of about 75 degrees to the plane of the Galactic disk, and it has a peculiar velocity of about 200 km\/s, almost three times that of the Local Standard of Rest. This velocity is similar to that of the recently discovered satellite Leo, but unlike that object, Bootes has a proper motion of about 10 mas\/yr, which means that it has not yet been gravitationally bound by the Galaxy and thus is a free satellite. We estimate that Bootes has a mass of about 10^5 solar masses (M_{\u26ab}\u22c5R\u2081\u2080 \u2248 2.4 kpc$^{-1}$), a value that is not only similar to Leo's but also to that of the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds. We discuss the possibility that Bootes, like Leo, may be a dwarf spheroidal satellite, but we also point out that its large peculiar velocity and relatively large proper motion imply a different dynamical history from that of Leo."}

{"text":"\n\nWe have performed a systematic angle-resolved photoemission study of the quasi-two-dimensional organic superconductor \u03ba-(BEDT-TTF)2Cu[N(CN)\u2082]Br.

We show that this result is consistent with the singly-degenerate ground state that is likely to be formed by the mutual annihilation of spin-correlated electrons in the quasi-two-dimensional hole-doped CuBr chain and the un-doped BEDT-TTF molecule. Our result suggests that the strong antiferromagnetism in the metallic phase of \u03ba-(BEDT-TTF)2Cu[N(CN)\u2082]Br is a generic feature of hole-doped quasi-two-dimensional organic superconductors, and is in striking contrast to the absence of any spin-correlation in the electronic state of the cationic electron-doped quasi-two-dimensional organic superconductor \u03ba-(BEDT-TTF)2CsK.[^1] We also show that the antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations in \u03ba-(BEDT-TTF)2Cu[N(CN)\u2082]Br are protected by a weak exchange interaction U, and that this interaction has a strong anisotropic component, U \u2248 2.1 (along the chain) \u221e (perpendicular to the chain).

{"text":"\n\nWe present the results of an analysis of the nature of infrared sources in a 11 micron selected sample from the first year data of the AKARI North Ecliptic Pole Deep Survey. We find that the contribution from interlopers to the continuum sources is significant.

This shows that the resonant state is not as special as it may seem. We also investigate the relation between the resonant state and the ground state. We show that if we have an exact solution of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for the ground state, then we can use this to produce an approximate solution for the resonant state. We show that this is an important property in practice, for example in the computation of the ground state of the Hamiltonian."}
{"text":"\n\nThis paper presents a methodology for the estimation of machine and component residual life, based on the application of neural networks. The motivation for this research stems from the need to estimate the residual life of components in a cost-effective and reliable manner, in order to minimize the occurrence of component failures and to maximize the utilization of components. The key idea behind the methodology is to use neural networks to learn the relationship between the condition monitoring data and the residual life of the components, based on historical data. The methodology is evaluated using a case study from the oil and gas industry, where the residual life of compressor components is estimated based on vibration data. The results obtained show that the proposed methodology is capable of accurately estimating the residual life of components, with an overall accuracy of 99.2%.\n\nThe problem that this work attempts to solve is the estimation of machine and component residual life, which is a critical issue in many industries, such as the oil and gas industry, where the failure of components can lead to costly downtime and reduced productivity. The practical application of this work is the development of a tool that can be used to estimate the residual life of components, based on condition monitoring data.

{"text":"\n\nWe are motivated by the challenge of creating visual designs that are not only pleasing but also effective and functional.

We propose a methodology for evaluating forms in immersive environments and discuss the practical and theoretical implications of our work.\n\nOur approach is grounded in the idea that the design of forms is not only a matter of aesthetics but also a matter of communication. We believe that in order to design effective forms, it is important to consider the way people perceive and interact with them. We propose that immersive environments provide a unique opportunity to study the perception and interaction of forms, as they allow for a more natural and intuitive interaction than traditional graphical user interfaces.\n\nOur methodology consists of three main steps: (1) a qualitative analysis of the form's content and context, (2) the design of the form itself, and (3) the evaluation of the form's effectiveness and usability. In our work, we focus on the evaluation step and explore how different design decisions affect the perception and interaction of forms in immersive environments.\n\nWe conducted a series of experiments in which we presented participants with different forms in immersive environments and collected feedback about their perception and interaction with the forms. Based on our results, we suggest design guidelines for creating effective forms in immersive environments.\n\nOur work has practical implications for the design of forms in immersive environments and theoretical implications for the study of perception and interaction with forms in general. We believe that our methodology can be applied to the design of forms in a variety of contexts, and that our findings can contribute to the growing body of research on immersive environments and user experience."}

{"text":"\nWe report on a systematic experimental study of the time-dependent flow of a viscous fluid in a spherical Couette system rotating at constant angular velocity and immersed in a dipolar magnetic field. The spatial dependence of the induced helical flow is determined by two dimensionless parameters: theCouette number C and the magnetic flux ratio \u03bc. The first is proportional to the ratio of the rotation and viscous coefficients, the second describes the competition between the magnetic field and the geometry of the sphere. We measured the mean axisymmetric velocity field for six values of C and six values of \u03bc in the range from 0 to 1. The results show a rich variety of flow regimes, which we discuss in the framework of a simple theoretical model. Our main result is a quantitative description of the transition from axisymmetric to helical flow, based on a critical value of the ratio C\u03bc. This description is consistent with a transition from a steady-state solution to a time-dependent solution of the viscous flow equations with a small but non-zero initial velocity field. We also found good agreement between our experimental results and the predictions of our model for the mean velocity and the standard deviation of the velocity field."}
{"text":"\nA Generalization of the Stillinger-Lovett Sum Rules for the Two-Dimensional Jellium\n\nWe consider the two-dimensional Jellium model as a limiting case of the Stillinger-Lovett model in the thermodynamic limit. We obtain a generalization of the Stillinger-Lovett sum rules which is shown to be exact for a large class of functions. The generalization is obtained by means of a system of integral equations which are shown to be satisfied by the solution of the Jellium model. This approach has been followed earlier to study the one-dimensional Jellium model. The Jellium model is further simplified by using the Hellmann-Feynman Theorem which relates the Jellium dynamics to the motion of a relativistic particle in a potential field. The resulting equations are shown to be integrable, and the integral solutions are expressed in terms of certain special functions. The problem of determining the constant of integration is discussed. Finally, the generalization of the Stillinger-Lovett sum rules is applied to compute some physical quantities of interest."}
{"text":"\nWe present photometric and spectroscopic observations of the low surface brightness galaxy PGC045080, in an effort to characterize the accreting supermassive black hole (SMBH) and the gas disk surrounding it. We find that the accretion state of the SMBH is highly variable on timescales of weeks, with accretion flaring events accompanied by gas disk evaporation and subsequent refilling. The accretion events are characterized by a power law increase in the accretion luminosity function, with a timescale of decay of the order of several days. These flares cause the gas disk to evaporate and the SMBH to become uncovered. The gas disk then refills, resulting in a characteristic time series of disk evaporation and refilling. The timescale of disk refilling is roughly constant, at a rate of $\\sim 5 \\times 10^{10} M_{\\odot} \\, {yr^{-1}}}$. We conclude that the gas disk is fed by a low level of accretion from the SMBH, and that this accretion is episodically interrupted by the accretion events. The mass of the SMBH is constrained to be $\\sim 10^{8} M_{\\odot}$. We discuss a mechanism by which the SMBH can produce these accretion events, in which a large fraction of the gas disk is contained within a much smaller inner region, where the SMBH is most efficiently able to accrete gas."}
{"text":"\n\nWe have developed a theory of macroscopic quantum tunneling in high-T_c c-axis Josephson junctions, which we have tested against a variety of experiments. In a typical experiment, a superconducting tape is patterned into a long array of Josephson junctions, each of which is 0.5-1 micron in length and separated by an insulator. When the array is biased with a DC current, each junction is found to have a critical current density for supercurrent passage, I_c, which is several times greater than that expected from an ideal thermodynamic equilibrium condition, and a non-Equilibrium transport behavior, which we show to be in agreement with a model in which a macroscopic quantum tunneling process is invoked to describe the transport in these junctions. We analyze a series of experiments in which the role of the bias current, the thickness of the insulator, and the temperature is varied, in each case successfully explaining the results in terms of a theory of macroscopic quantum tunneling in which a massless exciton-like particle is coherently transported through the barrier between the superconducting electrodes. We also show that the theory predicts a non-monotonic behavior of I_c as a function of the thickness of the insulator, in qualitative agreement with a set of experiments in which the thickness of the insulator is varied over a wide range."}
{"text":"\n\nWe propose a scheme for a geometrically defined self-dual supergravity theory with a pure Twistor geometry. Our construction is based on the well-known type IIA string theory with an anti-de Sitter (AdS) geometry, in which the standard Dirac fermions are replaced by their twistor counterparts. In this way we arrive at a geometrically defined self-dual theory with a pure Twistor geometry which is invariant under the anti-De Sitterication of the space-time. The same construction can be made for type IIB string theory, or, more generally, for any string theory with an AdS geometry, as well as for a certain class of self-dual supergravity theories with a pure anti-De Sitter geometry.\n\nThe construction of a self-dual theory with a pure twistor geometry is not possible in general, because the duality does not, in general, preserve the twistor structure. Our construction therefore provides a necessary and sufficient condition for a self-dual theory with a pure twistor geometry.\n\nWe show that the newly constructed theory is fully consistent, that its supergravity part is well defined and covariant under the standard Dirac transforms, and that its fermionic part is well defined and covariant under the twistor transforms. We then show that the theory has a good dynamic and that its two fermionic generators commute. We finally show that the theory can be made unitary.\n\nOur construction provides a possible physical interpretation for the twistor fermionic generators which is independent of the AdS geometry, and in which the Commutator relations for the fermionic and gravitational generators can be understood as a simple gauge invariance of the theory."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate the spatial distributions of forces and force chains in random stiff fiber networks. We consider a random graph model with edge probabilities depending on the distance between the nodes and the total number of edges in the network. To assess the statistical properties of the underlying force distributions, we introduce a novel algorithm to efficiently extract all the force chains in the network. The algorithm is based on a dynamic programming scheme that combines a Divide-and-Conquer strategy with a plane-wave basis expansion. Our main results show that the distribution of forces is heavily tailed, with a power-law tail of exponential form. We also show that the tail contains a large number of forces, which leads to a strong aggregation of the forces in a few chains. Our results suggest that the interplay between local anisotropic interactions and global symmetry breaking interactions gives rise to a complex force distribution with many small forces and a few large ones, in agreement with recent theories based on the concept of criticality."}
{"text":"\nWe present photometric detections of the CH and CN molecular lines in the source IRS - HH 188. The relative molecular luminosity of the source is  \u223c 10 38  W. We determine a radial molecular velocity of  \u223c 19  km s \u2212 1. This velocity is in good agreement with the measured proper motion of the ionised gas in the same source, thus confirming the hypothesis that the molecular gas and the ionised gas are the same physical entity. We have compared the observed distribution of the molecular gas with theoretical models. The best agreement is obtained with a model in which the molecular gas is distributed in a series of rings, with the molecular velocity at the centre being higher than the observed value. We discuss two possible mechanisms for producing this distribution, and conclude that the distribution has to be produced by a non-homogeneous process. We also discuss the distribution of the molecular gas in the region, and conclude that it is not possible to produce this distribution by a model in which the molecular gas is smoothly distributed with a constant velocity. We present a model in which the molecular gas is distributed in a series of expanding rings, with the number density of the rings declining exponentially with radius. We show that this model can produce the observed distribution of the molecular gas, with the number density being higher at the edge of the region than in its interior. We also discuss a model in which the molecular gas is distributed in a sphere, with the molecular velocity at the centre being higher than the observed value. We show that this model can also produce the observed distribution of the molecular gas, with the number density being higher at the edge of the region than in its interior."}
{"text":"\n\nWe propose and analyze a path integral method for solving the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) polaron problem in a semiconductor microcavity. Our method is based on a close analogy between the SSH polaron problem and the path integral representation of the quantum action functional for a diffusive particle moving in a harmonic potential field. Within this framework, the path integral representation of the SSH polaron problem is shown to be analytically continued to the Bargmann-Waron domain. The analytically continued path integral is then shown to have a special form, which allows for a straightforward evaluation of the contribution to the path integral from a large class of paths, including the exact stationary paths. The final result is a set of analytical formulas for the contribution to the path integral from the stationary paths, which can be used to evaluate the expectation value of any physical quantity of interest. The method is illustrated by an application to the path integral representation of the Dresselhaus coupling in the SSH polaron problem."}
{"text":"\nWe propose a new method for weak lensing tomography from space, based on optical and near-IR photometry, which we dub Photo-z. We show that a high-resolution space telescope can obtain the needed photometry for Photo-z with a time exposure of a few days per point source. The essential idea is to exploit the fact that the lensing potential has a very small redshift dependence, in contrast to the galaxy redshift selection, which requires at least an order of magnitude larger redshift range. We show that for a tomographic reconstruction, the time needed for a full sampling is several years, and we discuss various options to reduce this time. The resolution of the reconstructed lensing potential is shown to be comparable to that of galaxy redshift selection, but the relative error in the recovered lensing amplitude is larger. We find that for a typical tomographic analysis of a volume of LRW = 200hMpc3 the relative error in the lensing amplitude is about 10%, compared to 5% for a galaxy redshift selection analysis of the same volume. We discuss how the error can be reduced by a careful choice of the sampling points. We show that Photo-z can be applied to both galaxy redshift selection and weak lensing tomography, and that it is particularly suited for a rapid weak lensing tomography of relatively small volumes. This may be useful for a quick analysis of the lensing potential of a given volume, for example to select a volume for a detailed analysis with galaxy redshift selection, or to decide on the fly which galaxies to select for a detailed analysis. We discuss the potential of the method and the current and future space telescopes that can implement it."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present the results of a study of the dynamical status of the galaxy cluster Abell 115, in which we have used high-resolution optical imaging, archival radio data, and new X-ray observations obtained with the Chandra X-ray Observatory. The optical images show that the galaxies in the cluster follow the distribution of the X-ray gas, but are displaced by an average of 6.9 kpc in the direction of the radio source, A 115-F1. This discrepancy suggests that the cluster is in a state of dynamical friction, with the radio source acting as the dominant gravitational attractor. The combination of optical and X-ray data further suggests that the gas in the cluster has a velocity gradient, with the mean velocity increasing with radius. We propose that this velocity gradient is the result of a cooled-core cluster that is still experiencing dynamical friction. This conclusion is supported by a comparison of the projected motions of the X-ray gas and the optical galaxies, which indicates that the gas is flowing toward the radio source, while the galaxies are moving in the opposite direction."}

{"text":"\n\nDecision tree modeling with relational views\n\nWe consider the problem of decision tree modeling using relational databases. We present a solution that is based on the use of view definitions. The solution is illustrated with an example.\n\nRelational databases have become a standard for representing and managing data. A wide range of powerful and elegant database languages has been developed in the last two decades. Despite this, modeling using relational databases is not straightforward. One way to address this issue is to use a declarative approach, where the model is defined by means of views. The main advantage of this approach is that it does not require a proprietary modeling language. A view definition can be easily created by a database administrator, using the database language. In addition, view definitions have the same expressive power as the database language.\n\nA decision tree model can be represented as a view. The model structure is defined by means of union and join operations. An algorithm for computing the model prediction can be defined using the database language. The algorithm uses the view definition as an intermediate representation of the model. The main advantage of this approach is that the prediction algorithm can be easily generalized to any data model that can be represented using views. In addition, view definitions can be used as a common representation for different data mining algorithms.\n\nWe have implemented this approach in a prototype system. The system has been evaluated using a standard database and a standard data set. The results show that the proposed approach is feasible."}
{"text":"\n\nMotivation: The phenomenal growth of the Web has resulted in an enormous amount of data that needs to be managed. This has given rise to the problem of warehouses of data that need to be searched quickly and efficiently.

In this work, we focus on the latter.\n\nKey ideas and methodology: We propose a new way of organizing Web data that is designed to make it possible to efficiently search the data. Our approach is based on the idea of organizing data into a hierarchy of nodes, with each node being a container of data. We then define a way to associate data with nodes in the hierarchy, and a way to search for data by navigating the hierarchy.\n\nWe present a practical algorithm for associating data with nodes in the hierarchy, and we present a practical algorithm for searching the hierarchy for data.

{"text":"\n\nAbstract\nWe have all heard about the data deluge, the phenomenon of the exponentially growing volume of data in the world, which is a result of the widespread use of digital technology. The data deluge brings with it an unprecedented opportunity to extract knowledge that can be used to make better decisions, resulting in improved efficiency and productivity. However, in order to extract knowledge from the vast amount of data, we need effective and efficient tools to store and process the data. Data warehouses are designed to store data that is gathered from multiple, heterogeneous data sources. The data in the warehouses is integrated, cleaned, and made available for users to extract knowledge. The current practice of data integration uses extract, transform, and load (ETL) processes that are executed periodically. The ETL processes are handcrafted, hard-coded, and cannot be easily modified. The emergence of the Web and the ease of publishing data on the Web has resulted in an abundance of data that is available on the Web. However, the data available on the Web is not easily accessible to the data warehouses, due to the heterogeneity and complexity of the data, as well as the difficulty of extracting the data. The goal of this work is to investigate the problem of Web data modeling for integration in data warehouses. We propose a framework for Web data modeling and a language for specifying the models. The framework and the language are evaluated through a case study."}
{"text":"\n\nWe study the production of the Tsallis entropy in the limit of weak chaos. We show that an adaptive version of the recently introduced survivor function method can be used to evaluate the quantities involved, in a way that is both numerically stable and computationally feasible for a large class of systems. We use this method to compute the entropy for a number of one-dimensional maps and investigate its behaviour in the limit of weak chaos. We show that the entropy is always non-zero, but that for a large class of maps it converges to a constant value as the system is driven further into chaos. We interpret this result by considering a simple model in which the entropy is known analytically. We show that in this case the limiting entropy is simply the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy times a correction term that is proportional to the Forney probability. We then consider a number of examples for which this prediction is confirmed. Finally, we show that this method can also be used to produce a new indicator of chaoticity, which we call the survival entropy. This is related to the recently introduced groove function, but has a number of advantages, and is shown to perform well in a variety of numerical experiments."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present an analysis of the fine structure of solar prominences. We use a combination of spectroscopic and imaging data, which allows us to study the temperature and density structure of the prominence plasma. We find that the temperature distribution is well described by a log-normal distribution, with a standard deviation that decreases with height. This is consistent with a cooling flow, in which the temperature is decreasing with height, but the variation in temperature is increasing. We also find that the density distribution is well described by a log-normal distribution, with a standard deviation that increases with height. This is consistent with a gravitational instability, in which the density is increasing with height, but the variation in density is decreasing.\n\nOur results suggest that the fine structure of solar prominences is determined by a competition between the cooling and the gravitational instability. The cooling tries to decrease the temperature variation, while the gravitational instability tries to increase the density variation. The balance between these two effects determines the final structure of the prominence. Our results are consistent with a model in which the prominence is a self-organized structure, in which the cooling and the gravitational instability are competing against each other."}
{"text":"\n\nWe report on a systematic study of the hole spin relaxation in self-assembled quantum dots. Our results reveal a complex behavior of the hole spin, which is due to the competition of different types of spin relaxation mechanisms. For dot sizes smaller than the spin-phonon coupling length, we observe a fast and a slow component of the hole spin relaxation. The fast component is due to the re-distibution of the hole between different quantum dots, while the slow component is due to a spin-phonon-like relaxation mechanism. For dot sizes larger than the spin-phonon coupling length, we only observe the fast component. Our results are consistent with a model, where the different types of spin relaxation are characterized by different time scales and the competition between them results in the observation of different types of spin relaxation at different dot sizes.\n\nWe also found that the spin relaxation is strongly temperature dependent. The relaxation time as well as the ratio of the fast and the slow component decrease with increasing temperature. Our results are in agreement with a model, where the different types of spin relaxation are characterized by different activation energies and the competition between them results in different temperature dependences of the relaxation time.\n\nFinally, we discuss the practical importance of our results. The ability to control the spin relaxation in quantum dots is important for the development of quantum dot based quantum information processing and quantum communication schemes, where the precise control of the spin is necessary. Our results reveal that the relaxation mechanism in quantum dots is complex and depends on the dot size as well as on temperature. Therefore, a detailed understanding of the relaxation mechanism is necessary in order to design and optimize quantum dot based quantum information processing and quantum communication schemes."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present an analysis of the dust distribution in a sample of 24 edge-on galaxies selected from the SDSS with photometric redshifts, from which we have derived the stellar mass and star formation density. We have fitted the observed V and K'-band images of these galaxies using radiative transfer, in order to determine the dust surface and the dust-to-stellar mass ratio. We have found a correlation between the dust surface and the dust-to-stellar mass ratio with the stellar mass and star formation density of the galaxies. Our results suggest that the dust distribution is regulated by the mass of the galaxy. The dust-to-stellar mass ratio decreases with the increase of the stellar mass. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that the dust-to-stellar mass ratio is controlled by the rate of star formation. We have also found that the dust distribution is more clumpy in the low-mass galaxies, which may be due to the fact that the low-mass galaxies have been evolving for a longer time than the high-mass galaxies. Our results suggest that the clumpy structure of the dust distribution is related to the evolution of the galaxies."}

{"text":"\nWe study the structure of the nucleon form factors in the framework of the multipole model. We calculate the form factors in the energy region around the nucleon mass and in the region far away from the nucleon mass. We use the singularity method to evaluate the three-dimensional structure of the multipole model. We confirm that the form factors of the multipole model agree well with the available experimental data in the energy region far away from the nucleon mass. In the energy region around the nucleon mass, the disagreement between the form factors of the multipole model and the experimental data is found to be large. We show that this disagreement can be reduced by introducing a logarithmic correction to the form factors of the multipole model. The introduction of the logarithmic correction, however, does not improve the agreement with the experimental data significantly. We discuss various possible reasons for the disagreement between the multipole model and the experimental data in the energy region around the nucleon mass."}
{"text":"\n\nEstimates of the optimal density and kissing number of sphere packings\nin high dimensions\n\nWe consider the problem of estimating the optimal density and kissing number of sphere packings in high dimensions. The optimal density of a packing is the density that minimizes the total volume of the voids between the spheres. The kissing number is the number of distinct kissing arrangements that can be formed by the set of spheres in the packing. We show that as the dimension increases, the optimal density and the kissing number tend to be close to their lower bounds, which are 1 and 2, respectively. We use a simple algorithm to estimate the optimal density and the kissing number of a packing. Our estimates show that the optimal density and the kissing number tend to decrease as the dimension increases, but the decrease is not very fast. The error in our estimates can be made arbitrarily small by increasing the number of spheres in the packing.

{"text":"\nWe developed a new algorithm to predict the effects of single point mutations on protein stability using only sequence information. The algorithm, based on three-state theory, uses the thermodynamic stability contributions from the evolutionary information in a protein sequence to estimate the free energy changes associated with single mutations. The algorithm was evaluated on a set of 80 mutations in the non-homologous end-joining protein Ku. For the set of mutations that were found to be stabilizing, our algorithm was able to detect the direction of the stability change (more stable or less stable), whereas it failed to detect the direction for the set of mutations that were found to be destabilizing. The predictive performance of the algorithm was compared with that of two other methods that are currently used to study the effects of single mutations on protein stability. Our algorithm performed as well as the other methods in the case of stabilizing mutations, but it significantly outperformed the other methods in the case of destabilizing mutations.

{"text":"\n\nWe present a deep spectroscopy study of 77 extended Ly\u03b1 sources (ELASs) selected from the recent Ly\u03b1 Channel survey at z~3-5. We obtain multi-epoch, high signal-to-noise ratio echelle spectra with Subaru\/SuprimeCam and resolve the fundamental challenges of such an endeavor: signal modulation by seeing, non-linear ghosting, and telescope focus changes. We model the variations in each spectrum to remove the effects of these and other systematics, and find that the resulting spectrum is consistent with a single power law with a linear attenuation of $3.3\\pm1.0\\%$, or alternatively, a two-component power law with $3.3\\pm1.0\\%$ and $-0.3\\pm0.9\\%$. We determine the redshift and find it to be $z\\sim3.8\\pm0.2$. We fit both a single power law and a two-component power law to the spectrum to determine the parameters of the power law, including a possible break in the power law at log(Ly\u03b1\/H$_{\\rm recession})~12.5. We determine the stellar mass of each ELAS by fitting a globular cluster globular profile to the deconvoluted image. We find the stellar mass of the ELASs to be log(M*\/M$_{\\odot})~8.06\\pm0.3, and the corresponding star formation rate to be $10^{41}$ M$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, assuming a stellar mass-to-light ratio of $1\\pm0.1$. The high quality of the data enables a detailed analysis of the ELASs. The power law indices and the globular cluster masses are consistent with a single burst of star formation at $z\\sim3.8$. The power law indices are also consistent with the ELASs being the gas-rich counterpart of the globular clusters in the same volume, suggesting that most ELASs are gas-rich globular clusters that formed at $z\\sim3.8$.

{"text":"\nWe consider the formulation of the minimal supersymmetric model with heavy scalars in a Blackbrane background. We show that the extra heavy fermionic generators introduced in this formulation do not change the structure of the SO(5) flavour symmetry group, but generate an additional Z_2 group which is in a duality relationship with the traditional MSSM SO(5) group. The Z_2 group in general has a non-trivial structure, and we consider a particular possible arrangement of the Z_2 generators which allows us to introduce a further U(1) group which is also in a duality relationship with the SO(5) group. This U(1) group can be identified with the tri-service (or 3-part-system) which appears in the traditional MSSM formulation, and which generates a vector boson with an eigenvalue which is a half-integer. We show that the U(1) group in the Blackbrane formulation must be equipped with an additional phase rotation generator, which results in a further general structure for the U(1) group. This in turn allows us to introduce a third service in the tri-service, and we show that this third service is related to the heavy scalars which appear in the Blackbrane formulation."}
{"text":"\nWe present ROXA, a new multi-frequency selected large sample of blazars with SDSS and 2dF optical spectroscopy. The study of blazars, a population of relativistic jets emerging from supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the centers of active galaxies, has been a rich source of information on many aspects of jet physics, accretion disc physics, and the structure of SMBHs. Here we present a new sample of blazars selected from the SDSS with the 2dF. We find that the new sample is well described by a power law with a cut-off at Mpc $\\sim 5-7$. The power law slope is consistent with the rate of expansion of the Universe, $\\alpha \\sim 1$, corresponding to blazars at a fixed redshift. The cut-off at Mpc $\\sim 5-7$ is likely to be the result of the ability of the SMBH to retain a relativistic jet (the so-called \"Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa\" limit). We show that this limit produces a universal SMBH jet power law with a characteristic length scale given by the SMBH spin-down timescale. This timescale is set by the accretion rate and the SMBH spin $\\alpha$, and is therefore a powerful probe of SMBH structure and accretion physics. We discuss the implications of this limit for the structure and evolution of SMBHs, and the resulting SMBH jet power law."}

We finally discuss the experimental signatures of NSSIPs, and outline a search strategy for them at the LHC."}
{"text":"\n\nWe have performed a high statistics calculation for the composition of the pseudoscalar eta and eta' mesons in the framework of the Quark-meson coupling constant (QCC) model. The QCC model includes the quark-lepton coupling and the quark-hadron coupling, and is able to describe the data of the charm quark distribution in hadron and lepton jets, the charm quark charge distribution in hadron and lepton jets, the charm quark pseudoscalar meson pair production in hadron collisions, and the eta meson production in lepton collisions. The model is based on the quark-meson coupling which is generated from the quark-lepton and quark-hadron coupling constants. In this article the eta and eta' mesons are regarded as the quark-antiquark mesons, the production of which is described by the Quark-meson coupling constant model. The model parameters are fitted to the data of the eta and eta' meson production in hadron and lepton collisions, and the theoretical results are in good agreement with the data."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a spectrophotometric model for galaxies in clusters that uses the observed distribution of cluster galaxies in color-magnitude space, and their correlation with the clustercentric distance, to infer the cluster light profile. We show that a gaussian profile fit to the clustercentric distribution of the galaxies provides a good fit to the observed distribution of galaxies in color-magnitude space, provided that the cluster redshift is known. The model provides a way to infer the cluster redshift, and the resulting redshift distribution is consistent with a linear evolution of cluster redshift with clustercentric distance. We apply the model to the WINGS galaxy redshift survey, and find that the model is able to recover the cluster redshift to within 1.7% uncertainty for clusters with bright galaxies, and within 2.3% uncertainty for clusters with faint galaxies. We show that the probability distribution of the recovered cluster redshift is consistent with a linear evolution of cluster redshift with clustercentric distance, with a slope of 1.44 \u00b1 0.07. We discuss the implications of our results for the kinematics of cluster galaxies, and for methods of using cluster galaxies to constrain cluster evolution."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present non-detections of gravitational radiation (GR) from three binary black hole (BBH) MACHOs in the Galactic halo, as searched for by the LIGO and Virgo detectors, during the ongoing Advanced LIGO Observing run (O4). We consider the prospects for detecting low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) containing black holes in the future, in the context of a growing population of detections of electromagnetic counterparts to LMXBs in the Galactic halo. We discuss how non-detections of GR from known LMXBs containing black holes can constrain the likelihood of detecting new LMXBs in the Galactic halo via the gravitational lensing effect, and the implications of our non-detections for models of accretion onto black holes in LMXBs. We also consider prospects for detecting a gravitating object in the Galactic halo that is not known to be a LMXB, on the basis of its weakly non-linear gravitational signature, and discuss what such a detection would imply about the nature of the halo. We conclude that a large-scale survey of the Galactic halo for weakly non-linear gravitational signatures is an interesting and important direction for future research."}
{"text":"\nWe study the dynamics of magnetization induced by a spin-polarized current in a point-contact geometry. We find a rich variety of oscillatory modes, which can be divided into two classes. The first class contains modes with frequencies  \u2248  0  Hz, which correspond to the conventional damped oscillations of the magnetization. These modes can be obtained in a linear approximation, and their damping is described by the standard expressions for Ohmic and magnetic damping. The second class contains modes with frequencies  \u2260  0  Hz, which are conventionally absent in this geometry. These modes are caused by a non-linear damping mechanism, and their amplitudes are governed by the transient spin-torque effect. Our model also describes the mode-hopping effect, where the oscillations can be driven from one mode to another by a small perturbation. We analyze our results by considering the generic case of a thin ferromagnetic layer in a point-contact geometry, and also by considering the specific case of a magnetic tunnel junction. Our results are relevant for understanding the dynamics of magnetization in nanoscale magnetic elements, and also for the development of spin-torque oscillators and sensors."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a catalog of 75 galaxies in the Andromeda II galaxy group from a survey of the region with Suprime-Cam on the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. This is the first survey of this region with a wide-field imager, and the first catalog of galaxies in a dwarf galaxy group. We describe the data and the analysis used to create the catalog. We find that the galaxies in our catalog are, on average, much more distant than local galaxies of similar optical luminosity, which demonstrates that the galaxies in the Andromeda II group are much fainter than local galaxies. We also show that the group has very little mass in stars or gas, in comparison to groups of galaxies of a similar optical magnitude. We discuss this in the context of the galaxies in the group, and also in the context of other dwarf galaxy groups. We show that a simple model in which galaxies in a group are brought together by a common expansion velocity, in contrast to groups which are held together by a massive central object, can explain many of the observed properties of the Andromeda II group."}
{"text":"\nWe present here results of a systematic study of the correlation between cosmic rays and gamma rays in the energy range above 100 GeV. We have developed a new method which enables us to measure with a high statistical significance the correlation between the cosmic ray and gamma ray fluences on a spatial scale of several tens of degrees. Our method is based on the measurement of the spectral distribution of the scattered gamma rays from the terrestrial atmosphere, which allows us to obtain the fluxes of cosmic rays and gamma rays on the ground. We found that the correlation function between the cosmic ray and gamma ray fluences has a positive peak at a correlation coefficient of about 0.6, indicating a significant correlation between these two quantities in the energy range above 100 GeV. The correlation function changes sign at a cosmic ray fluence of about 10\udbff\udc05\u00b7cm\udbff\udc05\u2079 \u00a7 6 , which corresponds to a gamma ray fluence of about 5\udbff\udc05\u00b7cm\udbff\udc05\u2079 \u00a7 2 . We explain this behavior by a simple model in which the production of secondary cosmic rays is described by a single power law with a linear dependence on the primary cosmic ray fluence. Our results suggest that the correlation between cosmic rays and gamma rays in the energy range above 100 GeV is due to a common production mechanism, i.e., hadronization of the primary cosmic rays and subsequent decays of the hadrons."}
{"text":"\n\nWe have synthesized and characterized a series of Co doped TiO2 films by atomic layer deposition using different partial pressures of O2 in the growth atmosphere. The effect of the Co dopant concentration on the structural, transport and magnetic properties of the films was investigated. We found that the Co doping concentration in the films increased with the increase of the O2 partial pressure in the growth atmosphere and that the films were almost completely oxidized. The electrical resistivity and the carrier concentration in the films showed a strong temperature dependence, which was attributed to the thermally activated charge transport and the thermally activated trapping and detrapping of electrical charges at the defect sites in the film. The magnetic properties of the films were investigated by a superconducting quantum interference device magnetometer. The Co dopant particles in the films formed a chain-like structure, which resulted in the appearance of a thermally activated spin dependent signal in the magnetoresistance of the films in the magnetic field applied along the chain-like structure."}
{"text":"\nWe consider a model of strongly correlated electrons with two kinds of effective interactions, $\\lambda$ and $\\mu$, which can be understood as two different kinds of Higgs mechanisms. We show that this model is in a special point in the phase diagram, namely the so-called horseshoes state. We find that the transition temperature to this state decreases with increasing density. In the case with $\\lambda\\gg\\mu$, we find a strengthening of the transition temperature to the superconducting state, compared to the case with $\\lambda\\ll\\mu$. We also find a transition temperature to a non-Abelian state, which is stronger in the case with $\\lambda\\gg\\mu$ compared to the case with $\\lambda\\ll\\mu$. Our results can be understood in terms of the dynamic charge-flavor-locked states, which are related to the coexistence of a continuous symmetry and a discrete symmetry. We also show that the results are consistent with the idea that the strong interactions can be treated as a quark color-flavor-locked state in a quark-meson model."}
{"text":"\nWe present neutronic performances of the MEGAPIE (Mega-eolin for Power and Innovation in Energy) target concept for a high-tech, next-generation nuclear reactor. The MEGAPIE concept is based on a high-neutron-per-iteration core, which can be realised by either upfront equipping the core with a large number of neutron-rich fuel elements or by designing the core such that it becomes increasingly neutron-rich during operation. The performances are investigated by means of a three-dimensional (3D) neutronic code, with a coarse-mesh-type (CMT) approach being used for the core calculations in order to reduce the amount of computation time. The investigated parameters include the number of fuel elements, the fuel enrichment, the number of core iterations and the background cross-section. We observe that the number of fuel elements has a strong influence on the performances of the core. The influence of the other parameters is less pronounced. For the purpose of comparison, we also investigate the performances of a traditional core design based on a low-neutron-per-iteration core. We observe that the traditional core design always has a higher flux than the MEGAPIE core. For the traditional core design, we observe a clear trend in the increase of the flux when the core becomes increasingly neutron-rich. This trend is less pronounced for the MEGAPIE core. We attribute this to the fact that the MEGAPIE core is designed such that it becomes increasingly neutron-rich during operation, which means that the increase in flux is spread out over the entire lifetime of the core. The results of this work indicate that the MEGAPIE core is especially suited for implementing additional passive safety systems, as these systems can make use of the high flux."}
{"text":"\n\nWe are motivated by the recent dramatic growth of genomic databases, which areexpected to reach the petabyte scale within a few years. As a typical example,the current version of the popular ENZYME database, which contains manuallycurated information about enzyme functions, has already reached  > 100MB.It is becoming more and more difficult to manage such huge databases byusing traditional methods based on structured queries. On the other hand,genomic data is inherently graphical, since biological processes arerepresented by networks of interactions. Therefore, we have developed avisual data mining system, called Immersive Graph-based Exploration(IGE), which is based on the interactive visualization of graph-structureddata. IGE is an immersive environment which allows users to browsegenomic databases by freely navigating through the databases' graphs.Users can not only view the graphs, but also extract subgraphs from themon the fly. In order to evaluate IGE's utility for genomic data mining,we have tested it on two benchmark genomic databases, the ENZYME andthe FlyBase. We show that IGE can efficiently extract the largest subgraphsfrom these databases in a few seconds, whereas a conventional methodwould take several hours.\n\nOur results suggest that IGE is a promising tool for visual data miningof genomic databases. However, the current implementation of IGE is Schemamanipulated and its interaction model is not intuitive enough. To addressthese issues, we are developing a system called ISIS, which is an Interactive, Immersive, and Synthetic intelligence-based system for visual data miningof genomic databases."}
{"text":"\nWe present an analysis of the optical counterpart of NGC300 X-1, a source revealed to be aWolf-Rayet (WR) star in 2010 by 369- Angstrom infrared data from the Wide Field Infrared Survey Explorer (Wise). The optical data, from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), show the source to be a classical B1IV star with aWR shell. The WR component has a relatively low mass, about one solar mass, compared to the donor star. We find that the WR layer has a total mass of 1.65 kT, with a temperature of 17.5 kK and a diameter of 1.1 pc. This implies a density of 1.2 x 10^-3 kg m-3, which is two orders of magnitude less than the mean density of the interstellar medium. The low density and large size of the WR layer implies that the shell is not gravitationally bound to the donor star. We conclude that the WR layer is a global feature of the ionized intergalactic medium in the form of a shell that has a thickness of 4.5 kpc and that is centered on the ionization peak of NGC 300. We estimate the mass of the shell to be about 2 x 10^3 solar masses, which represents about one percent of the global intergalactic medium. The extremely low density of the shell implies that the ionized gas is not in the form of a plasma but rather an \"exhaust-like\" shell. The high temperature of the shell suggests that the gas has been shocked. We discuss various possible mechanisms that could have formed the WR shell."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a model of quasars in which the accretion power is controlled by the mass-flow rate out of the quasar. The flow is treated as viscous and the accretion disc is assumed to be isothermal. Within this framework we show that the observed correlation between the mass-flow rate and the luminosity of quasars can be understood as a natural consequence of the outflows: as the mass-flow rate increases, the accretion disc becomes more optically thick and the quasar luminosity decreases. We find that a given mass-flow rate can be achieved with a range of accretion disc temperatures, and thus with a range of accretion luminosities. We discuss our model in the framework of the currently popular idea that quasars have a universal accretion disc temperature, and that the observed correlation between the mass-flow rate and the luminosity is a signature of such a universal relation. We show that a correlation between these two quantities does not necessarily imply the existence of a single temperature for all quasars, and that such a correlation can arise even if the disc temperature is not well defined. Our model predicts that the outflows have an important effect on the determination of the physical properties of quasars, and thus on our interpretation of observations of quasars.\n\nWe thank R. 1993 for useful discussions.

{"text":"\nWe study the production of Zgamma in ppbar collisions at sqrt(s) = 1.96 TeV, and we present limits on anomalous ZZgamma and Zgammagamma couplings in these collisions. We use the event-by-event tracking method based on the late-time behavior of theonia tracks, and we find that the Zgamma production cross section in ppbar collisions is consistent with the standard model prediction, and we obtain the Zgamma longitudinal production ratio to be slightly larger than one. We also present limits on the production of ZZgamma and Zgammagamma in ppbar collisions at sqrt(s) = 1.96 TeV. The limits are derived from the observation that the cross section for the production of Zgamma is small in ppbar collisions compared to that in pp collisions, and the limit is then derived from the difference between the two cross sections. We find that the standard model prediction for the cross section of ZZgamma production is consistent with our observation, and we obtain limits on the anomalous ZZgamma coupling parameter in the range of 1.0-1.5 GeV^{-1} at the level of 2.5sigma, and limits on the anomalous Zgammagamma coupling parameter in the range of 0.1-0.9 GeV^{-2} at the level of 2.5sigma."}
{"text":"\nWe present photometry and spectroscopy of three ultra-lithium-deficient (ULD) halo stars in the solar neighbourhood, two of which are blue stragglers (BSs). The properties of these stars are consistent with the general picture of the evolution of massive Bs in globular clusters, but they also reveal some distinctive features. In particular, the inner-shell hydrogen-deficient and carbon-rich nature of these stars is consistent with a scenario in which a non-convective core helium-burning phase occurs in an advanced stage of stellar evolution. We also discuss the nature of the lithium deficiency in these stars. Although a large fraction of the gas in the outer convective envelope has been lost, a significant amount of mixing and enrichment with hydrogen and helium from the core must have occurred to produce the observed lithium abundances. We propose that this mixing is related to the core helium-burning phase and is due to violent convection events associated with the onset of core helium burning."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present here results of a systematic search for very high energy (VHE) emission from 37 nearby (Mpc) galaxies observed with the Milagro detector. No evidence of VHE emission from any of these galaxies is found, despite the fact that some of them have already been reported as possible sources of VHE gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) on the basis of their optical and N-ray emission. We show that the observed non-detections in galaxies with known N-ray and optical emission can be used to set upper limits on the flux from the burst in these galaxies. In this way we obtain the first constraints on the fluence and spectral shape of the VHE emission from short-duration (duration <5 ks) GRBs in the energy range above 200 GeV. We find that the average fluence from such bursts in our sample galaxies is likely to be less than 4 kGray, and that there is a preference for a spectral shape with a roll-off above 100 GeV. The likelihood of a burst in our sample galaxies having a fluence higher than 4 kGray is small, with a probability of 0.6% or less. Our non-detections set the most stringent limits on the fluence and spectral shape of the VHE component of short-duration GRBs. The only source in our sample with a non-detection probability of about 50% is the closest galaxy (Mpc), which also has the highest N-ray flux. We discuss this object in detail and show that the probability of a burst having a fluence higher than 10 kGray is small (5%)."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider a covariant massive gravity theory in which the graviton propagator is a product of a scalar field and its dual tensor field. We show that this theory can be made symmetric under the exchange of the graviton and the dual tensor field, which is not the case in the standard theory. The resulting theory can be further simplified by using the constraint that the trace of the tensor field is proportional to the scalar field. The propagator obtained is shown to be symmetric and we further show that it can be written as a sum of two propagators, one of which is the standard graviton propagator in massive gravity and the other is a dual tensor field propagator. We further generalize this result to a theory with a non-minimally coupled scalar field and show that the propagator can always be expressed as a sum of two propagators, one of which is the standard graviton propagator and the other is a dual tensor field propagator. This result suggests that the non-minimally coupled scalar field has a meaningful physical interpretation."}

{"text":"\nWe present a QCD approach to B->D \\pi decays and CP violation. We find that the standard unitary theory is able to account for the data in a satisfactory way, after a suitable choice of the parameters. The approach is based on the use of the so-called \" idiot \" fermions, which represent the lightest quark and antiquark pairs. The idiot fermions are assumed to be almost massless and to have a small effective lifetime. Therefore they can only be involved in the decays of heavy quarks. The dynamics of the idiot fermions is described by a master equation, which includes the production and the decay of the idiot fermions as well as their possible interactions with other quarks and antiquarks. We show that the introduction of the idiot fermions allows to understand the experimental data on B->D \\pi and B->D \\pi \\ell^+ \\ell^- decays, in particular the excess of D \\pi \\ell^+ \\ell^- and B\\overline{B} pairs over the Standard Model expectations, without the need of introducing new quark or antiquark states, as it is usually done in the context of the Unitary Theory. In addition, we analyze the role of CP violation in B->D \\pi and B->D \\pi \\ell^+ \\ell^- decays. We show that the standard unitary theory is able to account for the observed CP violation in these decays, if the violating couplings are small and have a suitable form."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present the results of a statistical study of the distribution of voids in interplanetary and interstellar grains, as a function of grain size.

We find that the statistics of voids can be used to identify the dominant formation mechanisms, and to evaluate the effects of these mechanisms on the aggregate size distribution.\n\nWe find that the statistics of voids are consistent with the formation of aggregates by the agglomeration of particles in a stagnant gas, provided that the particles are large enough to form a void around themselves. We find that the voids are more likely to be located at the centers of the particles, rather than at their boundaries, suggesting that the particles are more likely to be captured by the aggregates than to be ejected from them. We also find that the size distribution of the voids is consistent with the growth of the aggregates by the accretion of particles that are smaller than the characteristic size of the voids.\n\nWe also discuss the implications of our results for the interpretation of observations of voids in astronomical bodies, such as comets and interplanetary dust particles.

{"text":"\nWe present the results of a zero-field and Zeeman-split Andreev reflection spectroscopy study of the spin-dependent transport in single crystals of the magnetic semiconductor EuS. We show that the spin-dependent transport can be explained in terms of a simple model which comprises a non-hysteretic spin-dependent Mott variable range hopping and a uniform spin-dependent Anderson delocalization of the transport across the entire energy spectrum. We show that by using the technique of Andreev reflection spectroscopy we can access the spin-dependent transport in a clean way, without any contribution from the non-Mott variable range hopping. Our results show that the spin-dependent transport in EuS is sensitive to an external magnetic field in a way that is consistent with the predictions of the model. We also found a non-monotonic behavior of the spin-dependent conductivity as a function of the magnetic field, which we explain in terms of a competition between the variable range hopping and the delocalization. Our results are consistent with the idea that the variable range hopping is the relevant mechanism for the transport in the entire magnetic field range, except for the very small magnetic fields, where the Anderson delocalization plays a more important role."}

{"text":"\n\nWe have synthesized ferromagnetic Co doped ZnO nanoparticles of different Co concentration by using sol-gel method and studied their structural, electrical, and optical properties. The synthesized particles were found to have spherical shape with the size of 100-300 nm as confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. The structural study revealed that the particles are single crystalline and the Co atoms are randomly distributed throughout the particles. The magnetic properties of the particles were studied by using a vibrating sample magnetometer and the particles were found to be ferromagnetic below the critical concentration of Co atoms and superparamagnetic above the critical concentration. The particles exhibited a transition from metallic behavior to insulating behavior as the Co concentration was increased. The electrical transport studies showed that the resistivity of the particles increases as the Co concentration was increased and a steep increase in resistivity was observed at the critical concentration. The particles exhibited a thermally activated behavior for the electrical transport below the critical concentration and a behavior close to the Mott variable range hopping below the critical concentration. The optical studies revealed that the particles exhibited a strong absorption peak below the critical concentration and a weak absorption peak above the critical concentration. The results showed that the electrical and optical properties of the particles are sensitive to the concentration of Co atoms and can be used to detect the presence of a magnetic field."}
{"text":"\nWe present a measurement of the top-quark mass using missing $E_T$+jets events with secondary vertex $b$-tagging at CDF II.

The $b$-tagging requirement significantly reduces the rate of spurious $b$-tags due to strong background. The mass is measured in the final state with one jet and one $b$-tag, using the resolved $S$-wave-function method. The $b$-tag is assumed to be a top-quark in the final state, and the top-quark mass is determined from the measured $S$-wave function.

{"text":"\nWe present a universal mass function that is consistent with the mass functions observed for galaxies, clusters, and superclusters in a wide range of environments. The mass function is derived from a stochastic model of structure formation that includes both the linear density profile and the radial velocity distribution. We show that this model naturally produces a universal mass function that depends only on the dimensionless density fluctuation amplitude A and on the ratio of the radial velocity dispersion to the mean velocity dispersion S\/D. The mass function has a power-law tail with a power that is directly proportional to A. We show that this is consistent with the assumption that the distribution of matter is spatially uncorrelated in a large volume, provided that the mean velocity dispersion D is large compared to the radial velocity dispersion S. This means that the assumption of a Gaussian velocity distribution is not necessary for a universal mass function, but a broad velocity distribution with a power-law tail is consistent with a universal mass function. We show that the mean mass and the total mass of a structure are directly proportional to A and S\/D, respectively. This means that a universal mass function can be obtained without introducing an extra parameter to describe the mass function. We also discuss the implication of this result for structure formation."}

The first, identified in archival data from the MAGIC telescope, is associated with the young radio pulsar B1257+12. This is the first definitive detection of a PWN in VHEs, and the first identification of a PWN in any wavelength band based on a firm association with a single pulsar. The second is a likely PWN detected in archival data from the IceCube neutrino telescope, associated with the young radio pulsar B1510+57. This is the first candidate PWN detected in VHEs based on a firm association with a single pulsar. We find that the VHEs from these sources have a power law spectra with a cut-off energy around 100 GeV, and are accompanied by a significant excess of multi-TeV VHEs from the direction of the pulsars. These properties are consistent with a shock-ignition of VHE emission in a PWN, possibly in combination with inverse-Compton scattering of relativistic electrons in the magnetosphere of the pulsars. Our results suggest that a significant fraction of pulsars are likely to host a PWN, and that these objects may be able to explain the origin of the multi-TeV VHEs detected by previous experiments."}

{"text":"\n\nDetermining Full Conditional Independence by Low-Order Conditioning\n\nWe consider the problem of determining whether two events are conditionally independent given a low-order conditioning event. We show that an efficient solution to this problem exists in the case of discrete and continuous random variables, under the assumption that the conditioning event is independent of a third, auxiliary random variable. This auxiliary variable enables us to reduce the problem to that of determining whether a given linear combination of the conditioning event and the auxiliary variable is equal to the first event. We show that this can be done in polynomial time, provided that the coefficients of the combination are bounded by a constant. The problem is also shown to be equivalent to that of computing the conditional independence hypothesis (CHI) score. As an application, we consider the problem of determining the minimum-variance linear unbiased estimator (Gaussian), given a low-order conditioning event."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a first-principles-based tight-binding molecular dynamics (TB-MD) study of the thermodynamic stability of metallic single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) with a random number of vacancies, i.e., holes, along their circumference. We consider a large number of randomly generated SWCNTs with up to N = 10 vacancies, and determine their respective stabilities by computing the total energy of each system. We find that the number of stable SWCNTs drops sharply as the number of vacancies increases. Our results agree with previous empirical findings, and suggest that the number of stable SWCNTs decreases exponentially as a function of the number of vacancies. The largest number of vacancies for which we find a stable SWCNT is N = 4. We also investigate the effect of a given vacancy on the stability of the SWCNTs, and find that the presence of a vacancy greatly decreases the stability of the SWCNTs. Our findings are consistent with the idea that vacancies in SWCNTs weaken their structural integrity."}
{"text":"\nWe present a measurement of the baryon density in a large volume of the warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM) at z=0.9-1.9, based on the analysis of broad Lyman alpha (Ly alpha) absorption in a sample of 47 quasars with redshifts in this range. We find a median baryon density of 5.7+\/-1.1 x 10^{-4} cm^{-3}, with a 68% probability range of 3.7-8.7 x 10^{-4} cm^{-3}. The scatter in the baryon density is large, with a standard deviation of 1.9 x 10^{-4} cm^{-3}, and a 68% probability range of 1.4-3.0 x 10^{-4} cm^{-3}. We show that the high scatter is likely due to the large overlap of the absorption features. We conclude that the baryon density in the WHIM is likely to be log normally distributed with a positive mean, in agreement with previous measurements. The measured baryon density is significantly higher than the mean baryon density in the local universe, and cannot be explained by the standard model of chemical evolution with a single baryon wind event. The high baryon density suggests that the WHIM contains a significant population of galaxies that were not formed in the early universe, and have not yet merged into the main body of the galaxy cluster."}
{"text":"\n\nAMBER on the VLTI: data processing and calibration issues\n\nA major aspect of the VLTI is the combination of the light from the different telescopes, referred to as interferometry. This requires precise knowledge of the baseline lengths between the telescopes, as well as of the optical path differences between the different arms. We report on the methods that we have developed to measure these quantities, on the basis of the data that we have obtained with AMBER during the first year of observations. We have been able to show that the VLTI can provide visibilities with an accuracy of a few percent, when using the two-channel techniques that we have developed. This is significantly better than what can be achieved with theMichelson interferometer, and it is only limited by the accuracy with which the absolute visibilities can be measured. We discuss the limitations of the data processing, and in particular the effect of decorrelation in the pupil images. We show that AMBER is already providing data with an accuracy that is close to the theoretical limit, and that this will improve further with longer integrations. We also discuss the limitations of the current model of the atmosphere, and in particular of the model of the telluric contributions. We estimate that this will limit the accuracy of the VLTI to a few tens of milliarcseconds in the coming years, and that a better model would enable a factor of two improvement. We also report on the effort that we have made to reduce the scattered light in the AMBER data, and on the relative importance of the different contributions. We show that the dominant contribution to the scattered light is from the atmosphere, and that this can be reduced by a factor of a few."}
{"text":"\nWe have performed a comparative study of the complex N- and O-bearing molecules in hot molecular cores. Our objectives were to investigate the relative abundances of these species in the cores, and to determine the conditions under which they are formed. We have used a combination of observations of molecular lines and non-molecular lines from HCl and H2O to determine the relative abundances of these species in a sample of 20 hot molecular cores. We have found that the relative abundances of these species are very different in different cores. The most striking result is that in most cores the relative abundance of N2 is much larger than that of CO, while in some cores the reverse is true. We have also found that the relative abundances of O-bearing species are often different in different cores. We have found that the formation of these species is closely related to the physical conditions in the cores, especially the temperature and the abundance of C and H. In particular, we have found that the formation of N2 is strongly favored in cores with low C\/H ratios, while the formation of CO is favored in cores with high C\/H ratios. We have also found that the formation of O-bearing species is favored in cores with low C\/H ratios."}

{"text":"\n\nWe propose and analyze a general scheme of quantum measurement as a final-state interaction with an external macroscopic system. Our approach is based on the concept of a generalized pointer which is a device that is in a quantum superposition of two pointer states and is correlated with an external system in a way that the final quantum state of the pointer is related to the state of the external system. We show that if the pointer is in a superposition of two pointer states and it is correlated with an external system in a way that the pointer's final quantum state is related to the state of the external system, then the pointer's final quantum state will be in a superposition of two pointer states, each of which is related to a respective state of the external system. We analyze this scheme for different models of pointers and external systems, and we show that in some cases the pointer's final quantum state may collapse to one of its pointer states even without any intervention from an external quantum system. We analyze this scheme for a number of different applications, and we show that it can be used to perform quantum measurements in which the pointer is macroscopic and the measured system is microscopic."}

{"text":"\n\nMotivation\nThe regulation of chromatin accessibility is a key mechanism for the regulation of gene expression. We have recently shown that the activity of the trans-histone H3K27-methylase Clr4 is important for maintaining chromatin in a compact state. In this study, we further investigated the role of chromatin accessibility in gene expression.\nResults\nWe have shown that the accessibility of chromatin, as measured by the ability of the trans-acting ATPase Swi3 to diffuse into the chromatin, is highly correlated with gene expression. Furthermore, we found that reducing the accessibility of chromatin by expressing a non-functional Swi3 protein reduces gene expression. We also found that mutations in the \u22121 nucleosome of gene promoters that reduce the accessibility of chromatin have similar effects. We have shown that a Swi3-dependent accessibility barrier is formed around the core promoter region of genes as cells enter the stationary phase. The formation of this barrier is dependent on the activity of the ATPase Cid15, which we have shown is involved in the formation of higher-order chromatin structures. In addition, we have found that the formation of Swi3-dependent accessibility barriers is dependent on the presence of the regulatory proteins Swi4 and Swi6.\n\nProblem\nWe have previously shown that the activity of the ATPase Swi3 is important for the expression of genes with a high chromatin accessibility.

{"text":"\n\nWe present a study of the gas distribution in the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) in the galaxy cluster 2A0335+096, in order to investigate the relationship between the cooling flow, radio sources, and star formation. We find that the cooling flow is mainly located in the eastern half of the galaxy, with a clear correlation between the gas distribution and the location of radio sources. The gas temperature and metallicity are in good agreement with the expectations from the cooling flow model, and show a clear correlation with the distance from the center of the BCG. We also find that the gas distribution in the western half of the BCG is significantly different from that in the eastern half, with much higher metallicity and slightly higher temperature. We discuss several possible explanations for this, and conclude that the most likely explanation is that the gas in the western half of the BCG has a different origin from that in the eastern half. Our results suggest that the cooling flow in the BCG is not well-mixed, and that the gas distribution is significantly affected by the presence of radio sources."}

{"text":"\n\nDamage identification is the process of determining the onset and progression of damage in engineered structures. This paper presents a data-driven damage identification approach that is based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Automatic Relevance Determination (ARD). The motivation for the research is that the current approaches to damage identification are largely model-based and rely on the a priori knowledge of the damage modes. The key idea is to use the PCA to extract the features of the damage signal and ARD to identify the damage modes. The methodology is demonstrated on a simulated damage data obtained from the execution of a 3-D Finite Element Analysis. The obtained results show that the proposed approach is capable of identifying the multiple damage modes and their evolution with the number of cycles. The results also show that the use of ARD is crucial to achieve the damage identification from the PCA features. The problem that the work attempts to solve is that the conventional damage identification approaches rely on the a priori knowledge of the damage modes. The practical application of the research is that the proposed approach can be used for the health monitoring and remaining useful life prediction of the engineered structures. The theoretical application of the research is that the proposed approach extends the data-driven damage identification to the case of the multiple damage modes and it provides a theoretical basis for the design of the damage detection algorithms."}

We presentEO methods that are capable of dealing with template-based registration. We discuss the similarities and differences between template-based registration and the more standard intensity-based registration. We present a number of novelEO methods for template-based registration and show how these methods can be used to register Templates. We compare the performance of theEO methods with the more standard mutual information-based registration. We show that theEO methods are competitive in terms of registration accuracy and are superior in terms of computation time. We also present a newEO method for template-based registration, which is based on the use of a Markov Random Field. This method is shown to be highly competitive in terms of both accuracy and computation time."}
{"text":"\n\n Atomic Electric Dipole Moments: The Schiff Theorem and Its Corrections\n\nWe consider the problem of measuring atomic electric dipole moments (EDM) and the question of when such a measurement is possible. We derive a general criterion for the ballistic determination of the EDM in a collision between an atomic system and an ion in a Paul trap. We apply this criterion to a recently proposed method for measuring the EDM of a hydrogen-like atom to within a few percent of its value and point out that this method does not work in general because the Schiff theorem (the requirement that the initial conditions for a collision must be symmetric with respect to a time reversal) is not satisfied. We then propose a general procedure for correcting the Schiff theorem in the case of a collision between an atomic system and an ion in a Paul trap. We show that in this case the correction to the Schiff theorem is very small and the requirement of symmetry is satisfied if the atomic system is initially prepared in a state with a well-defined EDM (for example, by using a magnetic-bottle technique). We also derive a general expression for the ratio of the EDM to its standard deviation and discuss a possible experimental arrangement for measuring this ratio."}

Our goal is to investigate the role of stochasticity in the regulation of accretion, and to explain the puzzling diversity in the accretion rate of AGN and quasars. We find that this goal can be achieved by a model in which the accretion rate is anomalously regulated by a noise source in the inner accretion flow. The model can produce the full range of observed accretion rates, from \"quiescence\" to \" outburst\", while preserving the fundamental virial theorem of black hole accretion. We also show that the model can explain the observed phenomenology of the accretion process, such as the size-luminosity and size- Mass relationships, and the cut-off at very low accretion rates. The model has several interesting and non-trivial steady state solutions, and these can be used to derive physical constraints on the underlying physical mechanism."}
{"text":"\nEffective anisotropies and energy barriers of magnetic nanoparticles with Neel surface anisotropy.\n\nWe consider the effective anisotropy and the energy barrier of a ferromagnetic nanoparticle in a non-magnetic medium for a range of diameters and aspect ratios, in the limit of small magnetization, assuming the spherical nanoparticles to be fully magnetized and in the limit of large magnetization, assuming the magnetic dipole moment to be confined to the particle surface. The surface anisotropy constant depends on the ratio of the particle diameter to the exchange length. The anisotropy constant becomes positive for particles with diameters smaller than the exchange length and negative for particles with diameters much larger than the exchange length. We show that, for particles with diameters smaller than the exchange length, the energy barrier has a minimum with the direction of the easy axis of the surface anisotropy. In contrast, for particles with diameters much larger than the exchange length, the energy barrier has a maximum with the direction of the easy axis of the surface anisotropy.

{"text":"\n\nWe present a fast algorithm to synthesize Taylor phase screens with Karhunen-Loeve (KL) basis functions.

Our approach is based on the observation that the synthesis of KL basis functions can be written as a linear system with a Toeplitz matrix. The use of FFTs reduces the computation of the Toeplitz matrix to the computation of a few discrete fourier transform (DFT) matrices. We also present a modification of the algorithm that uses FFTs to compute the KL basis functions. With this modification, the number of basis functions is reduced, and therefore the number of lines evaluations is also reduced.

{"text":"\n\nWe present a detailed analysis of the short duration gamma-ray burst (GRB) 050906, which was observed on September 6, 2005, by the Swift satellite. The burst lasted for only 2.2 ks, making it the shortest burst observed so far. The observed phenomenology is consistent with the burst engine being a black hole of 3-10 M\n Benoit, 2005. We find that the most parsimonious model for the observed phenomenology is a burst with a constant isotropic-equivalent radiated energy (ERe) of 5 kJ kg-1 and a fluence-weighted isotropic-equivalent radiated energy of 100 kJ kg-1. These two ERe values are almost equal, which implies that the burst was highly focused. We show that this can be explained by a GRB with an energy conversion efficiency \u03b7 from rest-frame isotropic-equivalent kinetic energy to isotropic-equivalent radiated energy of \u03b7 \u223c 0.1 and a burst-wide duty cycle of \u223c 0.1.

A burst engine with a relatively high rest-frame isotropic-equivalent kinetic energy of  \u223c 10 kJ and a relatively low \u03b7 \u223c 0.1 would produce a burst with a burst-wide duty cycle of \u223c 0.9 and an energy release of  \u223c 100 kJ. We discuss this burst in the context of models in which the burst energy is produced by a low-mass object (LMO) falling onto a massive object (MMO). We find that for this burst to be explained by the standard GRB model in which the burst energy is produced by an LMO falling onto an MMO, the MMO would have to be at least 10 times more massive than the LMO.

{"text":"\nWe study the relation between exact (or \"exchange-only optimized\") potential methods, which are exact in the sense that they use only the exact, optimized potential between any two basis functions, and more standard Kohn-Sham (KS) methods, which are exact in the sense that they use the optimized (but potentially inexact) potential between any two basis functions. This relation has been largely ignored in the literature, despite the fact that many exact potential methods have been developed over the years, including the exact covalent potential, the Coulomb potential, the Restricted Active Space (RAS) potential, the Emax potential, the Active Space Augmentation (ASA) potential, the Quickovec potential, and various \"iotk\" potentials. We find that many of the exact potential methods can be obtained as an approximation to the more standard KS methods by making a few relatively simple changes, and that the accuracy of these approximate methods can be improved by making relatively minor modifications to the basis sets. However, we also find that the performance of these methods depends on the choice of an appropriate reference state, and in particular that there is a \"paradox\" that the best results are generally obtained by using a reference state that has a relatively high total energy.

We separate the visible and dark matter (DM) in the WLGs and the cluster using two independent methods based on the spatial distribution of the galaxies and on the joint analysis of optical and near-infrared photometry. We find that the visible matter in the WLGs is displaced by 5-10 radii with respect to the DM, providing a very strong constraint on the evolution of the cluster with redshift and on the gravity profile of the cluster. Our results confirm the very good agreement between the two methods, suggesting that the analysis of the spatial distribution of galaxies is a powerful tool to study the distribution of DM in clusters. The displacement of the visible matter respect to DM, and the good agreement between the two methods, put a strong constraint on the nature of the dark matter in the cluster.

{"text":"\n\nWe present a detailed study of a highly magnified Lyman break galaxy (LBM) at z=3.07 in order to investigate the role of the molecular line in galaxy formation and evolution.

We find that LBMs at high magnifications are more likely to be gas-rich and have higher GIFs than LBMs at low magnifications. This is consistent with the hypothesis that LBMs at high magnifications are more evolved galaxies that have formed stars more efficiently. We show that the relative strength of the molecular line compared to the dust and FUV\/NIR continuum is correlated with the evolution of the galaxy, with more evolved galaxies having lower relative molecular line strengths. We also present an analysis of the morphologies of LBMs in order to further probe the evolution of these galaxies. We find that LBMs at high magnifications are more likely to have complex morphologies, while LBMs at low magnifications are more likely to have simple morphologies.

{"text":"\n\nWe present a census of baryons in groups and clusters of galaxies, based on a combination of galaxy redshift surveys and X-ray observations of clusters. We find that the total baryonic content of groups and clusters is 1.8 times that of the local galaxy group, with the groups containing slightly more baryons than the clusters. This result is consistent with the clusters containing relatively massive galaxies in the core, and the groups containing many more low mass galaxies in the outskirts. We find that the groups and clusters contain large amounts of gas, with the gas fraction dropping quickly from the clusters to the groups. This suggests that the gas in the clusters has recently been accreted, and has not yet had time to cool and condense into stars. The clusters and groups also contain large amounts of hot dust, indicating the presence of an active star formation.

We find that the signature of the nuMSM leptons is different from the SM leptons: they are not massless and they are not charged under a non-Abelian group. The masses of the nuMSM leptons can be uniquely determined from the properties of the SM Higgs sector. We show that the difference between the SM and the nuMSM leptons is strictly related to the origin of the masses of the SM leptons: when the masses of the SM leptons are generated by the symmetry breaking sector of the theory, the signature of the nuMSM leptons is exactly the same as the SM leptons, but with different masses. Our results suggest that the masses of the leptons are related to the way the theory is built, rather than to the dynamics of the theory."}
{"text":"\nWe have performed a systematic angle-resolved photoemission study of the f-electron system UPd2Al3 in order to investigate the evolution of the spectral features as a function of temperature and magnetic field. We found that the spectra can be classified into three different types, which have a good thermal and magnetic field stability, in contrast to the previous reports. These types are characterized by the presence of either a large split f-f band, a small split f-f band, or a non-split f-f band. In addition, the temperature dependence of the spectra is very different for each type, and the behavior of the spectral features as a function of magnetic field is also different for each type. We have explained these differences in terms of the different energy scales involved in the f-f interaction, in particular the splitting energy and the thermal variation of the single-particle energy. Our results suggest that the different types of spectra correspond to different types of local moments, and thus different types of pairing correlations."}
{"text":"\nWe study the equation of state of isospin-asymmetric nuclear matter in relativistic mean-field models with chiral limits. The isospin-asymmetry of the nuclear matter is implemented by a $3\\to 2$ symmetry transformation in the hadron sector, while the equation of state is obtained from a $2\\to 1$ hadron-antihadron symmetry transformation in the hadron-antihadron sector. We find that the relativistic mean-field models with chiral limits can well describe the isospin-asymmetric nuclear matter in a wide range of the baryon number density $\\overline{B}_{\\text{eq}}$, when the isospin-asymmetry is generated by a $3\\to 2$ symmetry transformation in the hadron sector. As the $\\overline{B}_{\\text{eq}}$ increases, the isospin-asymmetric matter approaches the pure isospin symmetric nuclear matter, and the hadron-antihadron symmetry transformation in the hadron-antihadron sector gradually becomes a pure isospin symmetry transformation. We also discuss the $\\overline{B}_{\\text{eq}}$ dependence of the isospin-asymmetric matter in the mean-field models with the Roses-uto-Young (R-U-Y) and the Gauss-Bonnet-Chern (G-B-C) limit, which are the chiral limits of the G-B-C and R-U-Y model, respectively."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a quantum field model in Fock space to combine concepts from different areas of quantum theory. Our model is general and can be used to model systems with any number of degrees of freedom, within the constraints of the mathematical structure of Fock space. The model is based on a set of quantum fields which are not all at the same level of abstraction: some fields correspond to particles, some to degrees of freedom of a particular type, and some to an accumulation of several degrees of freedom. The dynamics of our model is described by a set of Hamiltonian matrices which are not all at the same level of abstraction, either. Some of these matrices correspond to well-defined physical interactions, some correspond to more abstract relationships between the various degrees of freedom, and some to an accumulation of several interactions. The model can be studied using the techniques of quantum field theory, including the use of functional integrals. As an example application, we present a model of complex systems which combines concepts from statistical mechanics, quantum field theory, and nonlinear dynamics."}
{"text":"\nWe study the motion of charge carriers in a spin-split band, in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field. The field is assumed to be uniform over a large area, and a small area is considered in the neighborhood of an interface between two different types of spin-split bands. We show that the Zitterbewegung effect can be used to spatially concentrate the charge carriers in the spin-split band, provided the local field is large enough. The critical field for the appearance of the Zitterbewegung effect depends on the carrier energy, and can be estimated analytically. Our model can be realized in various material systems, such as quantum wells and strained-layer superlattices, in which the charge carriers are spin-split and a large perpendicular field can be applied locally.\nWe also discuss the possibility of a spatial modulation of the Zitterbewegung effect in a spin-split band, by means of a spatial variation of the perpendicular magnetic field. This could be useful to engineer the local density of charge carriers in a spin-split band, in order to obtain a desired distribution of carriers in the band. The motion of the carriers in a spin-split band is analyzed by means of the semiclassical Boltzmann equation, which is derived for a spin-split band. The Zitterbewegung effect is described semiclassically by a generalized Einstein-Laplace equation."}
{"text":"\nWe present a model in which the evolution of a magnetic flux rope in a stellar atmosphere produces a sequence of continuously increasing bubbles. We show that such a sequence of bubbles can naturally produce the collimated outflows typically observed in low-energy gamma-ray bursts. In this model, the smallest bubble is launched first and the subsequent bubbles are launched at increasing heights above the stellar surface. We show that the energy contained in the magnetic flux rope is sufficient to drive the bubble evolution. We find that for the bubbles to be efficient collimators of the outflows, the driving magnetar has to have a relatively high magnetic flux density, and the model provides a natural explanation for the observed correlation between the energy output of a magnetar and the energy injection into the bubbles. We discuss the physical origin of the magnetic flux rope and the efficiency of energy conversion from the rope's kinetic energy to the kinetic energy of the bubbles. We also consider the dynamics of the bubbles and the properties of the outflows."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a study of the cm radio continuum emission from the low-mass protostar L1014-IRS, based on observations with the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR). We aim to detect and characterize the cm emission from L1014-IRS, to study the relation between the cm emission and the previously detected mm emission from the source, and to search for indications of the presence of an accretion disc around the protostar. We find that the cm emission from L1014-IRS has a flux density of $1.7 \\pm 0.9 \\cdot 10^3 \\, \\mathrm{Jy}$ and that this value is consistent with the cm emission being due to a boundary layer with a temperature of $\\sim 1000 K$. The cm emission is slightly brighter towards the east-west direction, which could be explained by a small accretion disc around the protostar, although a misalignment of the magnetic field and the rotational axis of the protostar cannot be excluded. We find that the cm and mm emissions from L1014-IRS are consistent with a model in which the mm emission is produced inside a boundary layer that is located between the accretion disc and the surrounding interstellar medium, and in which the cm emission is produced in the boundary layer and in the interstellar medium."}
{"text":"\n\nGamma-Ray Imager (GRI) is a mission concept that aims to improve our understanding of gamma-ray bursts, the most energetic form of light produced in the universe. GRI would be a small, focused, and cost-effective mission that would fill a crucial gap in our knowledge of this important phenomenon.\nGamma-ray bursts are brief but extremely energetic events that occur in distant galaxies. They are a mystery because they release more energy in a few seconds than the Sun does in a year, yet they occur in galaxies that are billions of years old. The bursts are thought to be caused by the explosion of a massive star, but the details of the process are not fully understood.\nGRI would be a space-based mission that would measure the intensity, spectrum, and polarization of gamma-ray bursts. It would consist of a constellation of three small satellites, each carrying a pair of detectors. The detectors would measure the intensity and spectrum of the gamma-ray bursts, while the polarization measurements would help constrain the physical mechanism that produces the bursts.\nGRI would provide important scientific data that would help to understand the nature of gamma-ray bursts. It would also demonstrate the potential of small and affordable missions to perform cutting-edge science.\nGRI is a concept that is being developed by a team of scientists and engineers from NASA and other research institutions.

{"text":"\n\nWe show that galaxies containing Einstein clusters (ECs) as their dominant halo element correspond to a distinct population with respect to galaxies in which the dominant halo element is a standard single-peak structure. We find that this population exhibits a higher propensity to form galaxies with low surface brightness and high structural order, and a lower abundance of galaxies with high surface brightness and high structural disorder. We show that this distinction is due to the fact that the inner part of ECs is less dense than their outer part, in qualitative agreement with the predictions of recent computer simulations. We conclude that ECs can be responsible for the formation of a large variety of galaxies, but they tend to form ordered structures in their inner parts, and disorderly structures in their outer parts. We show that this conclusion can be guaranteed by a simple and physically motivated assumption on the density profile of ECs. Our results suggest that ordered and disorderly galaxies can be produced by different physical mechanisms, possibly in different epochs of the history of the Universe."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a Scalability and Optimisation of a Committee of Agents Using Genetic Algorithm. The motivation for the research is that we have a new committee of agents architecture that has been developed for the problem of decision making in a virtual power plant. The new architecture is composed of several intelligent agents that collaborate to make a decision. Each agent has its own genetic algorithm and is able to evolve. The architecture is designed to be scalable so that it can be used with any number of agents. The problem that we attempt to solve is that we do not know the optimal configuration of the genetic algorithm for each agent. The objective of this work is to find the optimal configuration of the genetic algorithm for each agent so that the committee of agents can make the best decision. The methodology that we use is to evaluate the performance of the committee of agents using different configurations of the genetic algorithm for each agent. We then compare the performance of the committee of agents using the different configurations. The results that we obtain show that there is a significant difference in the performance of the committee of agents using different configurations of the genetic algorithm for each agent. We are able to find the optimal configuration of the genetic algorithm for each agent that gives the best performance to the committee of agents. The practical application of our work is that we can use the committee of agents with the optimal configuration to make the best decision in the virtual power plant. The theoretical application of our work is that we have shown that the performance of a committee of agents can be improved by optimising the configuration of the genetic algorithm for each agent."}
{"text":"\n\nFinite Element Model Updating Using Response Surface Method\n\nThe motivation for this research is the need to update a finite element (FE) model in the presence of measurement noise and process\/model uncertainty. The measurement noise is assumed to be Gaussian and the process\/model uncertainty is assumed to be structured as a first-order autoregressive (AR) process. The goal of the research is to develop an FE model updating procedure that accounts for the effect of measurement noise and process\/model uncertainty on the updated model. The research approach is based on the response surface (RS) method. The RS method is a statistical modeling technique that has been used to model the relationship between a design variable and a response variable. In this research, the RS method is used to update the FE model in the presence of measurement noise and process\/model uncertainty. The RS method is used to develop a joint probability distribution for the response variables, which is then used to update the FE model. The updated FE model is evaluated using a leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) approach. The results obtained from the LOOCV analysis show that the proposed FE model updating procedure is able to update the FE model in the presence of measurement noise and process\/model uncertainty."}
{"text":"\nWe develop a theory of thermostatted inhomogeneous granular fluids, based on a self-consistent density functional description. Granular materials are characterized by a broad distribution of contact forces, which results in a strong temperature dependence of the dynamic and mechanical properties. We show that a correction term, proportional to the square of the temperature, can be added to the conventional stress tensor in order to describe these properties in a self-consistent way. Within this approach, the correction term is related to the Laplace operator and the contact interaction in a straightforward way. We analyze the influence of the contact interaction on the correction term, and we show that this interaction has a strong effect on the dynamic properties of the fluid, while it has a very weak influence on the mechanical properties. As an application, we consider the case of a fluid composed of non-interacting hard disks, and we study the influence of a small fraction of disks that interact with a given strength. We show that the dynamic properties of this fluid are well described by the theory, in a self-consistent way, provided that the contact interaction is chosen in such a way that the dynamic and mechanical properties are not too much affected by the interparticle interaction."}

{"text":"\n\nWe have investigated the charge injection capability of the X-ray imaging spectrometer (XIS) on board the Suzaku satellite, by utilizing the Hard X-ray transient hunter (HXT) instrument on board the Swift satellite. The charge injection is a major source of background in the energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS) analysis of impulsive transient sources, and therefore has important implications for the study of such sources. We found that the charge injection effect produced by XIS is moderate and the injected charge is not depolarized immediately. The temporal behavior of the charge injection is consistent with a model in which the injected charge is distributed in a finite volume conductor, with a time constant longer than the duration of the transient event. We also found that the count rate in the energy range above 2 keV, where the XIS sensitivity is dominated by the charge injection, is depressed by a factor of  \u223c 4 immediately after the transient event. We discuss the implications of our results for the study of transient sources and the improvement of the data processing for the EDS analysis of transient events."}
{"text":"\nWe propose that the acceleration of the Universe, recently reported by the Supernovae iiP2 and SNHBdb surveys, is driven by the Casimir force. We show that, in contrast to the attractive Casimir force between two parallel plates, the repulsive Casimir force between two Universe-sized (and flat) parallel membranes is finite and inward-directed, and its magnitude is precisely the numerical value reported by the Supernoves iiP2 and SNHBdb surveys. We evaluate the mass density needed to produce this finite and inward-directed Casimir force, and find that it is in agreement with the density required to accelerate the Universe by the observed amount. Our conclusion is that the observed acceleration of the Universe is the result of the repulsive Casimir force acting between the two parallel membranes that bound the Universe. We also show that the standard attractive Casimir force can be understood as the repulsive Casimir force acting between two very small (as small as a Planck length) and very close parallel membranes, which are present in every macroscopic attractive Casimir system."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a case for variational data assimilation in nonlinear geodynamical systems, motivated by recent progress in the field of statistical physics. In particular, we consider a one-dimensional, nonlinear, and sparsely observed magnetohydrodynamic system and show that the variational framework is capable of efficiently and accurately recovering the underlying evolution of the system. In this regard, we pay particular attention to the role of the geometric structure of the system, which in general leads to a substantial gain in the number of degrees of freedom as compared to the conventional evolution parameterization. In addition, we show that in this setting the use of an underlying flow field in the assimilated variables is key to an effective and efficient data assimilation. Our results provide a concrete example of an application of statistical physics ideas to geodynamical systems and might be useful in developing an optimal data assimilation strategy for this type of systems."}

Our result has important practical applications in the study of the motion and evolution of sand dunes.\n\nWe consider a simple model of a barchan dune, that is, a model that consists of a sharp-crested ridge, which is straight, and two hummocks, which are placed at the ends of the ridge. We assume that the ridge has a constant height, and the hummocks have a constant volume. We study the stability of such a model, that is, we study the conditions that guarantee the stability of the model. We find that the most important condition is the area of the base of the dune, that is, the area of the patera. We show that this area must be at least 3.3 km2. This area is independent of the height and the length of the ridge, but it depends on the shape of the base, that is, on the curvature of the patera. We also derive a simple formula that gives the minimal area of a barchan dune with a given length and height.

We prove that the solution is absolutely continuous and show that the covariance function of the solution is equal to the covariance function of the forcing terms, up to a constant that does not depend on the initial conditions. This allows us to write the solution in terms of the generators of the random forcing terms. We derive a stochastic Taylor formula and use this to show that the solution is almost surely differentiable and that the derivative has the same structure as the solution itself. We phrase the equation in terms of the phase-space representation and show that the solution has a limit as $\\lim_{t \\to \\infty}e^{itx}$ for almost all $x$. Finally, we show that the solution of the associated stochastic Schr\u00f6dinger equation is equal to the solution of the original Hill's equation up to a constant that does not depend on the initial conditions."}
{"text":"\nWe survey recent game-theoretic approaches to energy-efficient resource allocation in wireless networks. In particular, we focus on the problem of jointly optimizing the energy consumption and the Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements of a set of users, each having resource requests of different types and QoS requirements, and each being associated with a battery of finite capacity. We first motivate our survey by reviewing the challenges that the energy-constrained operation of wireless networks raises. We then present a game-theoretic formulation of the joint energy-efficient QoS provisioning problem and survey several game-theoretic solution concepts that have been proposed to solve this problem, including game theory, stochastic game theory, and mechanism design. We review both the classical approaches that consider the energy consumption of the users as a resource to be managed and the recent approaches that consider the total energy consumption of the network as a resource to be managed. We discuss the trade-off between the selfish and the socially-optimal behavior of the users, and we survey how this trade-off can be captured via the incentives offered to the users in the different game-theoretic solution concepts. We then survey the existing game-theoretic solution concepts in terms of their flexibility, which is captured by the number of parameters that their design requires, and their efficiency, which is captured by the performance that one can achieve with a given number of parameters. We finally discuss the practical relevance of the surveyed results and the open problems that remain in this field."}
{"text":"\nWe propose and analyze a game-theoretic approach to energy-efficient modulation in CDMA networks with delay QoS constraints. We consider a setting where the base stations are energy-constrained and the subscribers are delay-constrained. The base stations and the subscribers are allowed to negotiate over the modulation level to be used. We model this negotiation as a game, where the base stations and the subscribers are the players. We assume that the players are selfish and that they only care about their own utility, which we model as the respective amount of energy or delay. We show that the resulting game has a unique Nash Equilibrium (NE), which we characterize. We then analyze the performance of this NE, in terms of the energy consumption of the network and the delay suffered by the subscribers. We show that the NE achieves a near-optimal tradeoff between these two performance metrics. We also analyze the effect of different factors, such as the number of players, the types of players, and the initial conditions, on the outcome of the game. Finally, we discuss the practical implications of our results."}
{"text":"\nWe consider the gravity dual of the 1+1 dimensional Bjorken expansion, which is an effective field theory with a set of axiomatically defined variables, that has been proposed as a possible effective theory for the early universe by Brandenburg andructose [hep-th\/0609105]. The purpose of this work is to study the behavior of the dual theory as the ratio of the two scales approaches one. In particular we find a threshold value of the ratio, below which the theory is able to produce a late time accelerating expansion, in a fashion analogous to the way the original Bjorken expansion produces an early time accelerating expansion. The results are obtained by using the general machinery of the geometrically finite jet space formalism. The geometrically finite jet space allows one to rigorously define the relevant expansion and the relevant variable to be expanded. We find that the late time accelerating expansion is driven by a gravitational sink generated by a self-reproduction mechanism. This is similar to the way the early time accelerating expansion is driven by a cosmological constant generated by a self-reproduction mechanism in the original Bjorken expansion."}
{"text":"\n\nTrES Exoplanets and False Positives: Finding the Needle in the Haystack\n\nWe present a detailed study of the transits of the TrES-2 exoplanet system.

The star has a mass of 1.16 \u00b1 0.08 MD and a radius of 1.51 \u00b1 0.09 RJ. We estimate the star's age to be about 8 billion years. The system has a mass ratio of Q = [m(exoplanet)\/m(star)] = 1.1 \u00b1 0.1. We present high-precision transit data that reveal a wealth of new information. In particular, we find that the exoplanet's transit duration is increasing, the depth is decreasing, and the timing is evolving. We show that these trends are best explained by an increase in the exoplanet's orbital period, together with a concomitant decrease in the exoplanet's radius and mass. We derive a formula for the orbital period of the exoplanet as a function of the exoplanet's semi-major axis. We show that this formula has two solutions, one of which corresponds to the known exoplanet, while the other corresponds to a false positive. This work provides new insights into the dynamical behavior of closely-orbiting exoplanet systems, and it has important implications for the reliability of detecting exoplanets using the transit method."}
{"text":"\nWe present a systematic study of the effect of self-shadowing in the observed iron line profiles in spectroscopic observations of active galactic nuclei (AGN). We consider a simplified model of a thick accretion disc around a relativistically rotating supermassive black hole (SMBH), which has been employed previously to explain the so-called unified model of accretion disc lines. In this model the lines are formed by multiple reflections of the stellar light in the accretion disc. In the present work we carefully take into account the physical effects of self-shadowing, which is known to produce a blueshift of the observed lines. We show that self-shadowing produces a systematic shift of the model lines in the direction of the observed lines in low-mass X-ray binaries and AGN, if the SMBH is rotating relativistically and the disc is sufficiently thick. We evaluate the disc thickness for which this effect becomes important, and show that this thickness is consistent with the thickness required to explain the observed trend of line broadening with wavelength in the observed iron line profiles in a large sample of galaxies. We predict that in those galaxies in which the SMBH is rotating relativistically and the accretion disc is thick, the iron lines will be shifted by the effects of self-shadowing in the direction of the observed lines. This prediction can be tested by high-resolution spectroscopy."}

We have identified a variety of factors that are associated with larger impacts, including the presence of in-house staff scientists, the use of competitive grant awards to drive the research agenda, the use of partnerships to leverage the facility, the use of a peer review system to allocate facility resources, the engagement of faculty from multiple universities, and the targeting of large-scale, long-term science questions.

{"text":"\nTransport through quantum dots: A combined DMRG and cluster-embedding study. We present a combined exact diagonalization and molecular dynamics random-phase approximation study of the transport through a single quantum dot. The randomly initialised molecular dynamics generator is used to investigate the statistical properties of the transport process, while the exact diagonalization is used to determine the quantum mechanically correct levels and occupation numbers. The random-phase approximation is used to evaluate the transport through a chain of quantum dots. We find the presence of a strong boundary layer close to the quantum dot's boundaries, which is in agreement with previous Monte Carlo studies. In addition, our results suggest the existence of a weak boundary layer a few nanometres from the dot's boundaries. The transport through the quantum dots is found to be inversely proportional to the number of dangling bonds at the surface of the quantum dot. Our results also suggest that the transport through the chain of quantum dots is governed by the weakly interacting levels."}
{"text":"\n\nWe have measured the heat capacity of PbS as a function of temperature for several atoms. The isotope effect on the heat capacity has been determined for the stable isotopes with mass numbers 204, 206, and 208. The heat capacity of PbS is found to be extremely well described by a model in which the electronic contribution to the heat capacity is independent of temperature. The excess heat capacity has a positive temperature coefficient, suggesting that it is due to a contribution from the lattice. The agreement between the model and the data is good for temperatures below T \u2248 100 K, but poor for higher temperatures. The discrepancy is greatest for the isotope with the largest nuclear mass, 208Pb. We have also measured the magnetic specific heat of PbS, but the results are not definitive, as magnetic fields were not sufficiently stable. The low temperature heat capacity of PbS, in spite of its poor agreement with the model, is consistent with the heat capacity being due to lattice vibrations. The high temperature behavior is consistent with a model in which the electronic contribution to the heat capacity is independent of temperature, but the lattice contribution has a positive temperature coefficient. We discuss the results in the framework of a simple model in which the ions move in a square lattice, and the electronic states are described by a tight binding model."}
{"text":"\n\nAsteroid Deflection: How, where and when?\n\nAsteroids pose a serious threat to life on Earth and although they strike Earth only rarely, the consequences can be catastrophic. With the current lack of technology to deflect asteroids, the only option is to monitor their positions and attempt to evacuate the area where they are predicted to strike. We present here a new method for deflecting asteroids, which is based on a recently proposed concept of using a fleet of small spacecraft to deflect an asteroid by giving it a small push at the right time. We show that this method is capable of deflecting asteroids with a diameter as large as a few tens of km, which is large enough to be potentially dangerous. We also derive a simple formula that can be used to quickly assess whether an asteroid can be deflected or not, and we discuss the practical aspects of the deflection method, including the number and the relative sizes of the spacecraft, the time frame in which the deflection must be executed, and the choice of the asteroid's target trajectory after it has been deflected. We find that in order to deflect an asteroid whose diameter is on the order of tens of km, a fleet of spacecraft with a total mass of several hundred tons may be required, and the execution time window can be as long as a few months. We also show that an asteroid's target trajectory after deflection can be chosen so that the risk of an accidental collision with another asteroid is minimal. We believe that this method can provide a realistic and practical solution to the problem of asteroid deflection, and we discuss the key technological aspects that need to be developed in order to implement it."}
{"text":"\nWe study a wireless relay network with a single source and multiple destinations. We consider the problem of establishing a zero-lag long-range synchronization (ZLR-sync) between the source and a subset of the destinations, i.e., a ZLR-sync where the largest round-trip time is zero. For this problem, we first show the existence of a solution in a network with one-hop connections and a subset of the destinations with one-hop connections, i.e., a tree structure. Then, we extend our analysis to a general network with multi-hop connections. We show that a solution can be obtained by using a dynamical relaying strategy, where the relays act as oscillators and synchronize with their upstream node. We analyze the conditions on the parameters of the network that guarantee the existence of a solution, and we evaluate the quality of the solution in terms of the number of transmitting nodes and the error on the synchronization. We implement our strategy in a practical wireless testbed, and we evaluate its performance in terms of the number of packets transmitted and the degradation on the phase error."}
{"text":"\nWe study the non-perturbative renormalization of the chromo-magnetic operator in Heavy Quark Effective Theory (HQET) as a function of the quark masses and the number of colours. We show that the structure of the non-perturbative renormalization changes in a significant way when the quark masses are close to each other. In particular we find a strong non-perturbative enhancement of the operator when the quark masses are equal, which results in a small but non-vanishing magnetic quark mass in the limit of infinitely many colours. We show that this limit can be understood by using the concept of a non-perturbative condensate, which has been proposed to explain the long puzzling fact that the mass of the lightest quark is much smaller than the next-to-lightest quark in the quark model. In the limit of infinitely many colours the magnetic quark mass is completely replaced by the non-perturbative condensate. We show further that the non-perturbative condensate is related to the so-called  B* - B mass splitting, which is a parameter that describes the relative masses of the light quarks and the strange quark in the quark model. We discuss the physical meaning of the non-perturbative condensate and the B* - B mass splitting in the context of the strong quark coupling approximation, where the quark model and the HQET are equivalent."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a study of the correlation between star formation and the large-scale structure of the intergalactic medium (IGM) during the reionization epoch. We use a sample of 25 galaxies selected from the Hi-GAL survey, for which we have both high-resolution 21cm data from the COBE\/FIRAS soundings, and photometry from the SDSS. We show that the correlation between the star formation rate and the average 21cm intensity in a radius of 50 Mpc around each galaxy is negative, with a correlation coefficient of -0.47 \u00b1 0.10. This correlation is significantly different from the correlation between star formation and the local IGM metallicity, which is positive with a correlation coefficient of 0.44 \u00b1 0.06. We conclude that this difference implies that the large-scale structure of the IGM, and not the local chemical properties, is the primary regulator of star formation during the reionization epoch.\n\nWe also present a measurement of the correlation function between the 21cm emission and the matter distribution in the same 25 galaxies. We find that the correlation function between the two quantities has a peak at a scale of 4\u20135 Mpc, and we conclude that this is the typical size of the haloes in our sample. This implies that the correlation between star formation and the large-scale structure of the IGM during the reionization epoch is mainly due to the large-scale structure of the haloes, and not due to the correlation between the IGM and the matter distribution in the galaxies themselves. We discuss the implications of our results for the theory of star formation during the reionization epoch."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate dynamical non-axisymmetric instabilities in rotating relativistic stars. We show that the mirror symmetry of the equilibrium solution breaks down when the star is rotating fast enough, leading to the formation of a `twist'-related instability. This instability is associated with a pair of new vortices, which arise in the high-frequency limit of the solution. We show that this instability is always active when the angular velocity is larger than a certain threshold, which depends on the degree of anisotropy and the angular momentum per unit mass. We observe that the threshold is relatively low, so that this instability may be active in many real stars. We analyse the linear stability of this new instability, and show that it is stable against perturbations that are small in the angular-velocity space. Therefore, this new instability does not grow, but it may trigger other dynamical instabilities that are active in the slowly rotating regime. We find that this new instability is stable against a change in the degree of anisotropy, but it becomes unstable when the anisotropy is increased beyond a certain threshold. This implies that this instability may be active in many different systems, provided that the symmetry of the problem is broken in a relatively mild way. We also show that this instability is related to the previously discovered `utchin' instability, but the two instabilities are different in a number of ways. Our results imply that this new instability may be important in the dynamics of rotating relativistic stars."}
{"text":"\n\nWe report a continuous and magnetically driven separation of blood cells from plasma at the microscale. A microfluidic chip was designed to carry out the continuous and simultaneous separation of blood cells from plasma using magnetophoresis. Our motivation is to develop a portable and integrated system for rapid separation of blood cells from plasma at the point-of-care. The ability to separate blood cells from plasma is important for many diagnostic applications, such as determining the concentration of blood analytes, studying the formation of blood clots, and quantifying the activation of cells. We use a combination of permanent magnets and electromagnets to create a magnetic field gradient in a microchannel. This magnetic field gradient is used to separate the blood cells from the plasma based on the difference in the magnetic properties of the two constituents. Our approach uses a low magnetic field strength to avoid any damage to the blood cells. This work describes the design and the operation of the microfluidic chip, as well as the laboratory-scale characterization of the system."}

{"text":"\n\nPower spectrum of the maxBCG cluster sample: new evidence for the acoustic features\n\nWe present an analysis of the power spectrum of the maximum back-propagating cluster (maxBCG) in a sample of 9 galaxy clusters from the IDs43 field, selected to be free of strong acoustic features, in order to search for evidence of the presence of a spectral gap or a significant excess power at low frequencies. We find that the power spectrum of the maxBCG in all clusters shows a significant excess power at low frequencies, in a way that is consistent with the presence of a spectral gap. We also find that the power spectrum of the residuals from a linear fit to the data, and the power spectrum extracted from the 5th and 95th percentiles of the residuals, show a significant excess power at low frequencies. These results suggest that the maxBCG may be affected by strong acoustic features, even when the cluster as a whole is not. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that the maxBCG is produced by strong shock waves, which are able to produce the features we observe in the power spectrum even when the mean density of the cluster is not sufficient to produce them."}
{"text":"\nWe introduce the concept of protein folding, a problem of fundamental importance in biology, and we discuss several aspects of the problem and their relation to the physical principles of statistical mechanics and polymer physics. We also present a scheme to quantitatively describe the folding process for a large class of proteins.

We show that a simple model, which is based on the principles of elastic strings, can be used to describe the basic features of the folding process for many proteins. The model is consistent with the constraints imposed by the thermodynamics, and it allows one to calculate the most probable pathway of the folding process. The model can be used to study the effect of various experimental conditions on the folding process, and it can be used to design experiments which can test various aspects of the protein-folding theory."}
{"text":"\nWe consider the problem of finding the largest $\\Lambda$ that can be assigned to a given value of the angular-diameter-distance (ADM) and still have the resulting model be spatially flat and satisfy the observer constraint $D(z)\\sim 1$.

We also show that if $\\Lambda\\neq 1$ is the largest $\\Lambda$ that can be assigned to a given ADM, then the resulting model is not spatially flat and thus is not a solution to the FLRW equations with $\\Lambda\\neq 0$. This immediately implies that if $\\Lambda$ is allowed to take on any value, then the only spatially flat FLRW model is the one with $\\Lambda=1$. We show that this result is equivalent to saying that the ADM is always equal to the Hubble distance for $\\Lambda=1$, except in the special case where the ADM is exactly zero, in which case the ADM can be any positive value. We also show that this result implies that the ADM is always increasing for $\\Lambda=1$, except in the special case where the ADM is zero.

{"text":"\n\nA dynamical analysis of the 14 Her planetary system\n\nWe present a detailed dynamical analysis of the 14 Herbeltine planetary system. We have developed a new method that utilizes the bulk elastic properties of the planetesimals, which enables us to compute the orbital evolution of the system. We have made a good approximation by assuming that all planetesimals are equal in size and that their masses are distributed according to the one-zone model. We have compared the orbits of the eight planetesimals with the orbits of the giant planets, and we find that they are dynamically stable. We have also compared the semi-major axis of the orbit of the innermost planetesimal with the radius of the giant planet orbits. We find that this inequality is satisfied for all the planets, except for the orbit of the innermost giant planet. We have also found that the 14 Herbeltine system is dynamically stable provided that the planetesimals are massive enough. The system is also stable if the mass of the secondary planet is not too large. We have investigated the evolution of the system by varying the initial conditions, and we find that the system is very sensitive to the initial conditions, especially for the outer planetesimals."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) for a sample of galaxies selected from the AKARI Deep SEP Survey. The sample consists of galaxies in the redshift range 0.005 < z_reio < 1.5 with SEP luminosities in the range 10^36 - 10^37 erg s^-1, of which 50 are active galaxies and 50 are galaxies in the local volume. We use the AKARI archive to extract the necessary photometry and spectroscopy, and fit the resulting CMDs with a single broken power law. We then compare the galaxy colours in the local volume to those of the active galaxies, and find that the colours of the most luminous galaxies in the two samples are consistent with the colours of galaxies in the local volume, but that the colours of the less luminous galaxies in the active galaxy sample are consistent with a different relation, suggesting that the most luminous galaxies in the active galaxy sample are likely to be local galaxies, while the faintest galaxies in the active galaxy sample are likely to be distant galaxies. We discuss this conclusion in the context of the cosmological model, and find that a model in which the star formation density is scale invariant requires that the most luminous galaxies in the active galaxy sample be local galaxies, while a model in which the star formation density is scale dependent requires that the faintest galaxies in the active galaxy sample be distant galaxies. We discuss the implications of this result for galaxy formation in hierarchical structure."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present high-precision astrometric and radial velocity measurements of the candidate exoplanet companion to the K dwarf star HD 33636, which was discovered in a data-driven campaign using the Hubble Space Telescope (HST).

{"text":"\n\nWe present the results of a program to search for point sources in the gap between the stars of the Galactic plane and the galactic bulge, as a means to detect the putative Giant Interstellar Bubbles (GIBs) proposed by 1996.

We find four candidate sources in our data set, which we name CFIRB1, CFIRB2, CFIRB3, and CFIRB4. The properties of these sources are consistent with them being the thermal continuum emission from GIBs. We derive an upper limit to the thermal continuum emission of a GIB, were it to be spherically symmetric and at a distance of 50 kpc, of 1.6 kJy. The non-detections of the known GIBs in our data set can be explained by the large projection effects due to the propagation of the GIBs in a plane-parallel manner through the Galaxy. Our results set a stringent limit on the number of GIBs in the Galactic plane, and imply that their contribution to the galactic 12CO line is at most a few percent."}
{"text":"\n\nWe compute maximally supersymmetric planar amplitudes of neutral and charged weak gauge bosons at five loops. We use the basis independent gauge fixing approach and work in the limit of smallIGHT, where IGHT is the characteristic moduli. The large unraveling contribution from the non-Abelian spur leads to non-trivial three- and four-fermion contact terms in the loop expansion. In the limit of largeuckland, these contact terms can be simplified by using the Maass form of the contact three- and four-fermion operators. We evaluate the contact terms in the expansion of the scalar perturbation theory and compare with the predictions from the Heckerman-Nielsen model. We find that the good agreement with the model prediction holds only when the largest ellington and iveness contributions to the contact terms are discarded. This is related to the singularity of the expansion of the Heckerman-Nielsen model in the limit of largeuckland. To evaluate the singularity, we use the squark and sgedge operators in the expansion. The singularity can be avoided by an appropriate choice of the Legendre transformation in the loop expansion. After this transformation, the expansion has a convergent form with the leading term proportional to the heckelman-nielsen model. We also discuss the difference between the large and smalluckland limits in the prediction of the Heckerman-Nielsen model for the contact terms."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a simple method for inferring the three-dimensional structure of the solar corona from observations of radio pulsars. We show that if a pulsar is occulted by the corona, the observed properties of the pulsar's radio emission can be used to infer the three-dimensional structure of the occulting corona. We implement this method using observations of the solar eclipses of the radio pulsars B1259-63 and B1219+36, which were observed in 1999 and 2002, respectively. We find that the field-of-view-corrected light profiles of these eclipses are well described by a model in which the underlying pulsar emission is partially occulted by a smoothly-varying, three-dimensional, laminated, magnetized corona. We estimate the ambient magnetic field in the corona to be between 1 and 4 kG. We find that the structure of the corona changes as the solar cycle progresses: the corona is more structured during solar maximum and less structured during solar minimum. Our results are consistent with models in which the corona is magnetically structured, with the structure evolving with the solar cycle."}
{"text":"\n\nScheduling Dags under Uncertainty\n\nWe consider the problem of scheduling dags, which are directed acyclic graphs representing the dependencies between tasks, under uncertainty. We assume that the execution times of the tasks are independently and identically distributed random variables with known means and variances. We introduce the notion of a potential function that allows us to capture the degree to which a solution to the scheduling problem is affected by the uncertainty. We then show that the problem of finding a solution that minimizes the potential function can be converted to a semi-dynamic programming problem. We propose a solution to this semi-dynamic programming problem that is based on a generalized scheduledEarliestDueDate(EDD) policy, where the scheduled-EDD policy is defined by selecting the task with the earliest scheduled due date and then performing the task if its execution time is less than or equal to its scheduled due date. We evaluate the performance of the generalized scheduled-EDD policy by comparing its performance to that of the EarliestDueDate policy, which is the policy that selects the task with the earliest due date and then performs the task if its execution time is less than or equal to its due date, on several standard scheduling problems."}
{"text":"\nWe have performed a systematic study of the isospin asymmetry in the continuum of the A=14 mirror nuclei. The isospin degree of freedom is related to the nuclei by the spin- Independent Contractor (IC) theory. The theory is applied to the description of the continuum of A=14 mirror nuclei in the region of stability of the molecular state (BEC). The system of the A=14 mirror nuclei is in the special position, because the isospin degree of freedom is fully operational in this case. The theoretical framework of the theory is based on the assumption that the behavior of the A=14 mirror nuclei is described by the statistical system of two types of mirror nuclei (A=14, I=1\/2 and A=14, I=3\/2). The two types of nuclei are related by the exchange of the spin degree of freedom. The mathematical treatment of the theory is based on the application of the spin-IC theory to the model of the continuum of A=14 mirror nuclei. The parameters of the model are derived from the analysis of the experimental data. The application of the theory to the model of the continuum of A=14 mirror nuclei allows us to describe the behavior of the system in the whole region of its stability. The isospin asymmetry in the continuum of the A=14 mirror nuclei is described by the formula, which is derived from the analysis of the behavior of the two types of nuclei in the region of their stability. The isospin asymmetry in the continuum of the A=14 mirror nuclei depends on the parameters of the two types of nuclei. The results of the study of the isospin asymmetry in the continuum of the A=14 mirror nuclei are in agreement with the results of the theoretical calculations."}
{"text":"\n\nWe show that a physical quantum NOT gate, that is, a gate which implements the logical NOT operation on quantum bits, must be non-reversible in general. This is in contrast to the case of classical bits, for which a reversible physical NOT gate exists. We analyze a general model of a physical quantum NOT gate and show that if the gate is to be reversible, the dynamics of the gate must be entirely classical. We then consider a simple physical model which is generally non-reversible, but can be made reversible by adding a certain amount of noise. The interesting conclusion is that if one attempts to build a physical quantum NOT gate with the general model, it will not be possible to make it reversible by adding noise. This shows that there is a quantum limit to how efficient a physical quantum NOT gate can be. We also show that this quantum limit is very stringent: it implies that any physical system which has a well-defined binary representation and is used as a quantum bit will in general not be reversible when used in a physical quantum NOT gate.\n\nWe finally analyze a physical model which is reversible, but does not generalize to a multi-qubit gate."}
{"text":"\nWe report a microscopic study of the superconducting (SC) quantum critical point (QCP) between the antiferromagnetic (AFM) and the superconducting phases, using a variety of transport measurements on a high-T_c superconductor, CeCoIn_5. We find a good agreement between the results of electrical resistivity and thermal transport measurements, both in the normal state and in the superconducting state. We show that the resistivity has a power-law temperature dependence at low temperatures, consistent with the T^3 behavior expected at the QCP. In contrast, the thermal conductance shows a strong temperature dependence, with a crossover to the non-Fermi liquid behavior already at a temperature well above the critical temperature. We explain this difference by amodeling the thermal transport as a consequence of the presence of a variable range hopping (VRH) mechanism, which is active already above the critical temperature. We show that this model is in a good agreement with the temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity, as well as with the low temperature resistivity data. We also show that the variable range hopping model can in principle describe the transport in the normal state, although an additional mechanism is necessary to explain the power law temperature dependence of the resistivity in this state."}
{"text":"\nWe present a study of the influence of nuclear parameters of active galactic nuclei (AGN) on the FRI\/FRII dichotomy. We consider a large sample of active galaxies with well-studied central engines, for which we have reliable redshift information and high-quality ultraviolet (UV) data from the GALAXY 2000 survey. We find that the relative contribution of the nuclear emission to the total UV emission of the galaxy, as traced by the ratio of the nuclear to the integrated UV luminosity, is a powerful diagnostic of the FRI\/FRII dichotomy. We find that the probability of a galaxy being FRI is inversely proportional to this nuclear luminosity ratio. This is consistent with the idea that an AGN with a lower nuclear luminosity is less capable of powering the luminosity of its surrounding IGM, and hence is less likely to be a member of an FRI system. We also find that the accretion rate, as traced by the ratio of the nuclear to the total (nuclear plus IGM) luminosity, is a powerful diagnostic of the friend or foe dichotomy. A higher accretion rate is significantly more likely to be associated with a foe galaxy. We discuss these results in the context of the accretion history of an AGN and the feedback from the central engine to the surrounding IGM."}
{"text":"\nWe present a new method for measuring the relative strength of the torus and jet in active galactic nuclei (AGN) based on the analysis of the Taup\u014d supernova remnant. We find that the torus contribution to the supernova (SN) is anisotropic with a bias in the direction of the galactic plane, possibly related to the large-scale structure in the galaxy. We show that the strength of the torus is correlated with the mass of the central engine, but not with the accretion rate, the age of the system or the nuclear activity level. Our results suggest that the torus is driven by a feedback mechanism related to the SN, and that the torus and jet are approximately equally strong. We find that the strength of the torus can be used to reliably differentiate between AGN and galaxies, based on the assumption that the torus is less strong in AGN than in galaxies. The torus strength can also be used to estimate the accretion rate, the central mass, and the age of the system. We find that the strength of the torus increases with the age of the system, possibly due to the increasing effect of feedback from the SN. Our results suggest that the torus plays a fundamental role in the evolution of AGN and that its strength is an important parameter that can be used to probe the nature of AGN."}
{"text":"\n\nWe have developed a theory of the chiral properties of baryon interpolating fields (BIFs) in QCD. BIFs are quark antiquark structures which can be created by the emission of a meson at the end of a quark antiquark chain. Our theory is based on the idea that the quark and antiquark structures are different in the two chiral combinations, so that the corresponding BIFs have different properties. We find that the BIFs can be either left-handed or right-handed, depending on the chirality of the initial quark antiquark structure. The handedness of the BIF is related to the number of quark antiquark pairs in the initial structure and to the flavor of the meson which is emitted at the end of the chain. The properties of the BIFs which are left-handed and right-handed are quite different. For example, the left-handed BIFs tend to be heavier, and are not sensitive to the mass of the meson which is emitted at the end of the chain, whereas the right-handed BIFs are much lighter, and their masses are sensitive to the mass of the meson. We have also found that the BIFs can be converted from one handedness to the other by the emission of a quark antiquark pair. We discuss the possible experimental signatures of our theory."}

{"text":"\nWe develop a microscopic model for doped antiferromagnets that exhibits a massive CP$^1$ ground state and investigate the thermodynamic and dynamic properties of the system. We show that the model has a unique ground state with respect to a suitable action functional, and that it is characterized by a non-degenerate peak at the single-particle level. The possible phases of the system are determined by a competition between an extended Kondo effect and a spin-glass-like instability. We find a slow cooling of the system that is accompanied by a continuous shift of the order parameter, and we show that this cooling is anomalously slow compared to the predictions of the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) approximation. The slow cooling is in direct conflict with the predictions of the Kondo-like theory that is derived from the PBE approximation and that is applicable to the case without a spin-glass-like instability. We also find a temperature dependence of the static structure factor that is in qualitative disagreement with the Kondo-like theory. The slow cooling and the non-Kldoness of the static structure factor can be understood by a dynamic mechanism that is induced by the spin-glass-like instability."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider a large wireless network with randomly located nodes, in which the links are established independently from each other, and each link is given a random initial transmission power. We investigate the probability of a node being part of a spanning tree (a connected subgraph in which all nodes are connected to one another by either one or two links), as a function of the network size and the number of available nodes for a tree. We show that a simple model, in which each node is associated with a random variable that is uniformly distributed between -1 and 1, can be used to obtain an approximation to the probability of a node being part of a spanning tree. This approximation is valid for an arbitrary large network, regardless of its degree distribution. The main ingredient in the derivation of this approximation is the use of the principle of Maximum Entropy Random Functions. The approximation is very simple to compute and yields a good approximation to the true probability in relatively large networks. We also derive the complementary problem of the expected number of links in a spanning tree, as a function of the number of nodes. This problem is more difficult to solve, but we show that the solution can be obtained by applying the principle of Maximum Entropy Random Functions to a slightly modified version of the original problem."}
{"text":"\n\nThe Cargese Lectures on Brane Induced Gravity\n\nWe give an overview of the Cargese Lectures on Brane Induced Gravity, which are a series of lectures organized every year since 2013 by the Quantum Gravity group at the Physics Department of the University of Helsinki. The main aim of these lectures is to bring to Finland leading researchers who have made important contributions to the field of quantum gravity. During the five years of its existence, the Cargese Lectures have already become a well-established series of lectures on the subject of quantum gravity. The motivation for the research is to understand the structure of spacetime at the Planck scale, where quantum gravitational effects are significant. The key idea in our approach to quantum gravity is to consider the effect of a small scale structure on the evolution of spacetime. In our picture, the effective metric is induced by a two-dimensional (2D) lattice. We show that such a 2D structure is able to generate a time-like separation of the different states. This lattice induced gravity has several interesting features, which differ from the traditional general relativity. One of the most interesting results is that, in contrast to the Poincar\u00e9 group, the relevant symmetry group of the lattice induced gravity is the Lorentz group. As a result, the evolution of the induced metric is different from the Poincar\u00e9an one: the metric becomes static and the induced gravity becomes a Lorentz invariant. We also discuss the problem of the dynamics of the induced metric and the question of the classical limit."}

We show that under suitable regularity conditions on the flow, this optimization problem can be solved in a closed form. The resulting solution is a generalization of the familiarLegendre-Fenchel transform to the statistical flow inversion problem. This solution provides a rigorous justification for the commonly used techniques of singular value decomposition and QR decomposition in statistical flow inversion. The proposed methodology is applied to several examples, including the problem of determining the size distribution of particles in a flow from an image of the flow, and the problem of identifying the sources of a flow from the distribution of arrivals at a set of sensors."}
{"text":"\n\n Charge ordering is a phenomenon that occurs in certain classes of organic charge-transfer salts and in some inorganic compounds. These solids undergo a phase transition at a temperature T_c, above which the charge is no longer localized on individual molecules, but extends over long distances, giving rise to a macroscopic polar order. Our current understanding of charge ordering is based on the concept of charge-transfer salts as elementary particles, a picture which has been very successful in explaining many of the experimental observations on these materials. The main goal of this work is to study the effects of a structural factor, namely the anisotropy of the potential, on the charge ordering process. In particular, we consider a model of a one-dimensional solid, in which the anisotropic potential is generated by anharmonic intermolecular forces, and the system is in thermal equilibrium with its disordered phase. We find that the parameters which are relevant for the description of the charge-ordering process are the temperature T, the energy difference \u0394E=E_(c)\u2212E_(0) between the ordered and disordered phases, the inverse of the thermal friction coefficient \u03bd_(c), and the square of the dynamic length l_(c) which characterizes the correlation length. The order parameter \u03a8 does not have a simple expression in terms of the anisotropic potential functions that are considered. The analysis of the effect of anisotropy on the charge ordering process is complicated by the fact that anisotropic effects are in general related to the long-range character of the order parameter. The results obtained in this work are consistent with the picture that the anisotropic forces merely give rise to a long-range order of the charges, while the short-range structure remains disordered."}
{"text":"\n\nElectrostatic Climber for Space Elevator and Launcher\n\nWe propose a new concept of a space elevator that utilizes a climber with electrostatic thrust. The climber is a conducting shell that is capable of producing a large electrostatic field by applying a voltage between itself and a counter-electrode that is located at the anchor point of the space elevator. The space elevator is a rigid and lightweight frame that is deployed in a polar orbit. The anchor point is a conductive platform that is located on the surface of the earth and is electrically connected to the ground by a cable. The proposed climber has the potential to climb the space elevator frame in a continuous manner, overcoming the limitation of the finite number of grips, and it may also serve as the launching platform for a future space launcher. We analyze the efficiency of the climber and study the effect of the space elevator parameters on its performance. We show that the climber has the potential to reach a specific impulse of around 100 seconds with a payload-to-mass ratio of around 5%. We also show that the climber has the potential to be more efficient than any known space elevator concept."}
{"text":"\nWe present an analysis of the dynamics of a model of the early universe based on the assumption that the dark energy equation of state has a permissible range of values \u00a0\u2014\u00a0from w\u00a0=\u00a0-1 to w\u00a0=\u00a0+1. Within this range the model can describe the evolution of the universe from the Planck time to the current era. We show that the model dynamics is characterized by a slow-down of the evolution of the universe with the increase of the dark energy density, and this slow-down can be interpreted as the transition from a state with a negative value of the equation of state to a state with a positive value. The transition is accompanied by a discrete jump in the dark energy density. We analyze the structure of this jump and show that the dynamics of the model with a positive equation of state is well described by the Cosmological Constant model, if the initial conditions of the transition are chosen appropriately. Within this approach the Cosmological Constant model and the Quintessence model are not distinguished by the dynamics, but by the initial conditions. We also discuss the conditions for the transition to be associated with a Big Bang, which is accompanied by a change in the number of spatial dimensions."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider the problem of finding the depth of a halfspace from a point in an n-dimensional space. This problem arises in many practical applications such as in robotics, in particular in mobile robotics, where the depth is often referred to as the Euclidean distance to the nearest obstacle. We present a branch and cut algorithm to solve the problem. The proposed algorithm is based on a generalization of the famous flying angels problem to higher dimensions. We show that by relaxing the problem from a strict linear to a quadratic inequality, the problem can be formulated as a branch and cut problem and therefore can be solved in polynomial time. We implemented the proposed algorithm in C++ and compared its performance with the existing literature on the problem."}
{"text":"\nWe study self-trapping and breather dynamics in a weakly coupled nonlinear chain, which is the classical counterpart of the macroscopic tunneling dynamics in a linear chain with Bosonic excitations. We find two different types of breathers, which we call wandering breathers and self-trapped breathers. The wandering breathers are associated with a complex Ginzburg-Landau type mode and can be driven by a weak external field, while the self-trapped breathers are associated with a pure phase defect and can be created by a strong external field. We show that the wandering breathers can be viewed as a localized defect which is delocalized by an external field, and as a consequence the associated dynamics exhibits an inverse power-law decay of the amplitude. We also show that the self-trapped breathers can be viewed as a localized defect which is localized by an external field, and as a consequence the associated dynamics exhibits an exponential increase of the amplitude. Our results suggest a general mechanism for the formation of breathers in weakly coupled nonlinear chains, which could be useful for the study of breather dynamics in various complex systems."}
{"text":"\nWe study the contact process on heterogeneous and disordered environments. We develop a general and systematic method to expand the supercritical series for the contact process in these complex environments, which includes the cases of completely random and disordered systems as well as more structured and partially ordered systems. The method is based on the combination of the random-phase approximation (RPA) and the mean-variance relationship. It allows us to obtain an approximate solution for the contact process in these complex environments by expanding the supercritical series, whose coefficients can be calculated analytically in some special cases or numerically in general. We show that the main terms in the expansion have simple physical meanings and the coefficients have different ranges of validity, which depend on the type of environment and the contact process parameters. The results obtained in this work can be useful in practical applications such as in the design of efficient stochastic optimization methods for complex systems."}
{"text":"\nWe present a detailed analysis of the importance of collisions with neutral hydrogen for the modeling of the solar spectra of the weak lines of Ca II and Ti I in the photosphere and the solar limb. We derive an expression for the collisional broadening which includes the effect of the inverse square law, the tropisoidal height and the difference between the solar radiative and collisional constants. We show that the commonly used approximation of a flat collisional broadening is valid only in a narrow range of parameters and that the inclusion of the full collisional profile is important for an accurate modeling of the solar spectra of weak lines. We analyze in detail the effect of the mean free path on the shape of the collisional broadening and we derive a simple formula which allows to evaluate the maximum broadening as a function of the observing wavelength and the telescope's aperture. We finally discuss the relevance of the inclusion of the correct collisional broadening in the modeling of solar spectra and we point out that this is particularly important in the case of high resolution spectra."}

We describe the approaches we have developed to solve these issues, and the way in which they are implemented in our numerical code. We also discuss the impact of the various physical ingredients on the shape and evolution of the cosmic ray distribution, and the way this distribution can be used to constrain the physical parameters.

{"text":"\n\nWe present a year-long analysis of photometric and spectroscopic observations of the anomalous X-ray pulsar 4U 0142+61: as the third brightest X-ray source in the sky, it has been observed with many different telescopes over more than two decades, resulting in a wealth of data that has not been analyzed in a consistent manner. We find that the source is highly variable on timescales of hours to days, and that these variations are likely due to several mechanisms, including accretion disc inhomogeneities and temperature variations, and flares due to magnetic reconnection. We find no evidence for a persistent 6.4-hour orbital modulation, but we do find a hint of a 3.1-hour modulation that is consistent with the known orbital period. We show that flares occur on timescales of seconds to hours and can reach the flux levels of the outbursts reported in 1993 and 2002. We find that the accretion disc is relatively transparent to optical and NIR light, with a photon index of 1.1\u20131.3, and that the source is therefore likely to be optically thick in X-rays. We find that a model in which the accretion disc is comprised of two components, a hot inner region with a temperature of $9\u201312$ kK and a relatively cool outer region with a temperature of $4\u20136$ kK, fits the observed variability well. We discuss the implications of our results for the structure of the accretion disc and for the process of accretion."}
{"text":"\nWe conducted an experiment to test the hypothesis that people choose fairness in an Ultimatum Game when they have no incentive to do otherwise, whereas they become more selfish when they have an incentive to be fair. We used an evolutionary framework and design in which we pitted three different Ultimatum Game variants against each other in an iterated framework. In each Ultimatum Game, one party (the Proposer) makes a take-it-or-leave-it offer to another party (the Responder), who then either accepts or rejects the offer. We used different rules to allow the Responder to reject the offer and to determine the punishment the Proposer receives for making an unfair offer. In the baseline Ultimatum Game, the Responder could reject the offer and the Proposer received no punishment. In the second variant, the Responder could reject the offer and the Proposer received a small punishment. In the third variant, the Responder could reject the offer and the Proposer received a large punishment. We found that in the baseline Ultimatum Game, offers werefair, with an average offer of $0.48 and a standard deviation of $0.10. In the second variant, offers were significantly less fair, with an average offer of $0.30 and a standard deviation of $0.11. In the third variant, offers were significantly more fair, with an average offer of $0.54 and a standard deviation of $0.12. This result suggests that when there is no incentive to be fair, people are fair; when there is an incentive to be unfair, people become more selfish. We discuss the implications of our results for economics, psychology, and evolutionary theory."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider massive gravity with a Lorentz-violating (LV) bump function. Two distinct physical regimes are derived from a comparison of the bulk viscosity and the Celebrity autoresting flows. In the first regime, the equation of motion is invariant under a Local Lorentz Transformation (LLT) and the bulk viscosity is proportional to the trace of the covariance operator of the bump function. The resulting massive gravity is equivalent to the ordinary massive gravity with a traceable bump function. In the second regime, the bulk viscosity is proportional to the determinant of the covariance operator of the bump function. The resulting massive gravity is equivalent to the ordinary massive gravity with a non-traceable bump function. The main difference between these two regimes is the following: in the first regime the bulk viscosity is zero in the absence of the bump function, while in the second regime the bulk viscosity is non-zero even in the absence of the bump function. As a result, in the second regime the massive gravity with a LV bump function generically behaves like an ordinary massive gravity with a non-traceable bump function. In the first regime the trace of the bump function is a meaningful concept, while in the second regime the trace is not a meaningful concept. We show that the Poisson structure of the metric and the symmetry of the bulk viscosity are responsible for these two distinct physical regimes."}
{"text":"\nWe present an evaluation of the accuracy of synthetic stellar libraries in representing observed stellar spectra. We generate libraries of artificial stars using the synthetic spectral generator SSPEC, and compare their properties to those of observed stars in the SDSS. We find that SSPEC libraries are able to reproduce many of the observed properties of stellar spectra, including the shapes of the RGB and H-R diagrams, the number and distribution of spectral types, and the strength and shape of the Ba II wavelength 4122. However, we also find systematic differences between the observed and synthetic properties, including the number of G and K stars, the strength of the red clump, and the shapes of the H-R diagrams. These differences are likely due in part to the simplified spectral synthesis method used in SSPEC, which neglects many of the physical processes that affect the shape of stellar spectra, such as temperature-sensitive ionization levels and non-LTE effects. We discuss these effects and suggest possible remedies."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present photometric and spectroscopic observations of the massive transiting exoplanet TrES-3 b, the outermost of the two giant planets in the tight, retrograde-orbit system TrES-3. We found that the planet's inner dayside is significantly hotter than its outer nightside, indicating that the dayside is irradiated by four point sources in addition to the central star. These sources are the three inner giant planets and the Sun, all of which are more or less edge-on to the orbit of TrES-3 b. We estimate that the planet's dayside temperature is Te \u2243 890 K, while the nightside temperature is Tn \u2243 710 K. We explain this temperature difference by heat transport via thermal radiation and spillover of the dayside atmosphere into the nightside hemisphere. We show that this mechanism can also explain the temperature difference observed for the giant planet Neptune. We discuss the implication of these results for the fate of hydrogen-rich planets such as TrES-3 b as they migrate to smaller orbits. \n\nThe giant planet TrES-3 b was discovered in 2007. It has since been determined to be in a retrograde orbit, making it the only giant planet known to have both a retrograde orbit and a tight orbit around its star. The properties of this planet have been extensively studied, but its orbital evolution is not yet understood. We have measured the dayside and nightside temperatures of this planet using photometry and spectroscopy, and found that the dayside temperature is 890 K, while the nightside temperature is only 710 K. We can explain this temperature difference using a model in which the dayside is irradiated by four point sources: the central star, the Sun, and the inner giant planets.

{"text":"\n\nWe review the status of CP violation from the standard model to string theory. We organize the discussion in four sections. In the first section, we give a general overview of the sources of CP violation in the standard model and in string theory. In the second section, we review the early string models with massive left-handed neutrinos which can give rise to large CP violation. In the third section, we review the string models with three generations of quarks and three generations of neutrinos, which can also give rise to large CP violation. In the fourth section, we discuss the more recent string models with two generations of quarks and two generations of neutrinos, which can give small CP violation, and the question of whether the standard model prediction for the absolute value of the CP violation parameter is too small or too large for string theory is addressed. We also mention the question of whether the special treatment of the neutrino in the standard model is a hint of new physics beyond the standard model."}
{"text":"\n\nBit-Interleaved Coded Multiple Beamforming with Imperfect CSIT\n\nWe propose a novel technique for the downlink of a Multi-User Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MU-MIMO) system that incorporates beamforming and Bit-Interleaved Coded Modulation (BICM) to combat channel uncertainty in the Channel State Information at Transmitter (CSIT). Our proposed technique, which we dub Bit-Interleaved Coded Multiple Beamforming (BICMB), extends the single-user BICM scheme to a MU-MIMO system. In our proposed scheme, the receiver is aware of the bit-interleaved codebook used by the transmitter, and hence, it is able to perform Chase Combining (CC) of the multiple copies of its own codeword. Since the channel may not be perfectly known at the transmitter, the proposed scheme employs a codeword adaptation algorithm that varies the number of bits allocated to the different transmit beams in order to maximize the throughput. The proposed scheme is particularly well-suited for a system where the transmitter has a large number of transmit antennas, and therefore, a large number of possible beams, but only a coarse estimate of the channel at the transmitter. In such a system, the proposed scheme may achieve close to the same performance as a system where the channel is perfectly known at the transmitter, while requiring much less channel feedback. The proposed scheme is analyzed and compared to other related schemes in the downlink of a MU-MIMO system."}

{"text":"\nWe present the gas metallicity distribution in a large sample of clusters of galaxies in the distant universe, selected from the deepest X-ray observations with Chandra and XMM-Newton. We find that the gas metallicity increases with cluster radius, reaching metallicities of order of [Z\/Z_{Sun}]=0.5 at the cluster virial radius, in good agreement with the predictions of simple chemical evolution models. We show that the high metallicity of the gas at the cluster core has a simple explanation: the drag force on metal-rich gas is lower than on gas containing only hydrogen and helium, and therefore the metal-rich gas is less likely to be stripped out of the cluster by the supernova (SN) winds produced by the massive stars in the galaxies that are members of the cluster. This explanation implies that the high metallicity of the gas at the cluster core is an signature of the presence of massive stars in the galaxies that are members of the cluster, and therefore that massive stars were formed in the galaxies that are members of the clusters in the distant universe, at the same time that the first stars were formed in the Universe. We conclude that massive stars were able to form in the galaxies that are members of clusters at very high redshift, despite the high density and large velocity dispersion of the gas in those clusters, thanks to the lack of efficient gas removal mechanisms. We discuss the implication of our results for chemical evolution models, and for the nature of the first stars that formed in the Universe."}
{"text":"\nWe present a new method for estimating the probability distribution of the semi-major axis of wide binaries. Our method is based on a combination of the Hermite-Random Walk theory and the observation that the semi-major axis distribution is roughly symmetric around thelog(4\/3) component of the frequency distribution, which corresponds to a dynamic efficiency of $\\dot{\\phi}_{\\rm min} \/ \\dot{\\phi}_{\\rm max} \\sim 4\/3$. We show that this result is consistent with a broad range of numerical simulations, and provide an analytical expression that can be used to derive the semi-major axis distribution in the limit of large number of revolution. Our result shows a power law decline of the semi-major axis distribution for wide binaries, with the power law index being consistent with thelog(4\/3) component being a single power law with a power law index of 1.81 \u00b1 0.01. This is in agreement with our previous work based on numerical simulations, and implies that the random walk model for wide binaries is not able to produce a semi-major axis distribution with a strong log(4\/3) component. We also derived a simple approximation for the observed frequency distribution of the semi-major axis of wide binaries."}
{"text":"\n\nMeasuring Electric Fields From Surface Contaminants with Neutral Atoms.\n\nWe present a new method to measure the electric field generated by surface contaminants. Our approach is based on the use of neutral atoms to probe the field. We show that a statistical ensemble of neutral atoms, if prepared in a state with a well-defined spatial distribution, can be used to map the field in the vicinity of a surface. The method does not require the atoms to be charged, ionized, or contacted by a conductive probe. It therefore bypasses the need to bring a charge carrier close to the surface, and can be used to measure electric fields in hostile environments and in situations where the field is strongly inhomogeneous. We demonstrate the method by measuring the field generated by a single contaminant on a semiconductor surface. Our current approach is limited by the need to infer the field from a statistical ensemble of atoms. We discuss how the method can be improved by preparing atoms in a particular quantum state, in which the field-induced orbital motion of an atom can be directly measured."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a study of the 12um ISO-ESO-Sculptor and 24um Spitzer faint counts in a volume selected to contain a complete sample of ULIRGs, AGN and massive ellipticals, with the aim of elucidating the nature of these galaxies and their relationship to the evolution of cosmic star formation. We find that the faint counts are consistent with a contribution from a population of massive ellipticals\/ological galaxies, with an average star formation rate (ffeu) of 6-9%, a finding supported by the fact that the ffeu of this population peaks at log(M\/M\u2299) \u2248 2.5-3.0. These galaxies also show a clear correlation between ffeu and the velocity-weighted mean radial distance, r, of the galaxy from the galaxy cluster centre: ffeu \u221d r-1. We show that this correlation is likely to be explained by a process of 'evolution by types', in which massive ellipticals with low ffeu tend to be in the centres of galaxy clusters, and those with high ffeu tend to be at the cluster edges. The main conclusion of this work is that the observed correlation is consistent with a scenario in which massive ellipticals evolve by 'switching off' star formation in the centres of clusters and 'switching on' in the cluster outskirts, possibly due to the impact of tidal interactions and\/or slingshot from the cluster potential. The low ffeu in the cluster centres is likely to be due to the action of the central AGN, which is known to be able to shut down star formation in clusters by several mechanisms. We discuss our results in the context of the evolution of massive ellipticals, and in the context of the evolution of star formation in clusters. We find that the faint counts contain a wealth of information about both of these processes, and we discuss the implications of our results for future research."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a catalog of more than 800 weak MgII absorbers observed with ugri1339 at a redshift of ~2. These data were obtained as part of the SkyMapper survey.

We find that the strength of the MgII absorption lines is well described by a power law with an index of -0.9. The distribution of the MgII strength is also well described by a broken power law with a break atlog( MgII\/Var) ~ 1.4. We find that the variance in the MgII strength is $\\sim 10^{-2.5} \\times 1\\, \\rm arcsec^2$, and that this scatter is correlated with optical depth, such that the scatter is smallest for log( MgII\/Var) $\\sim 1.4$ and increases towards lower and higher optical depths.

{"text":"\n\nWe present a catalog of 2\u00d7105 randomly selected Galactic dark matter subhalos, constructed using the StructuredStreaming algorithm applied to the uncorrupted part of the DarkMarkovian galaxy (DMG) simulation. We describe the shape, orientation, and alignment of these subhalos, and find that they have well-defined oblate spheroids with the major axis pointing in the direction of the Galactic disk. We find that the alignment of the subhalos is very good, with the degree of alignment increasing with the concentration of the subhalo. We compare the results with earlier results from the Tokyo parting and find that they are consistent. We find that the alignment is slightly better for the subhalos in the DMG than for the subhalos in the Tokyo parting, which we attribute to the different techniques used to extract the subhalos. We also present the catalog of all the subhalos in the DMG with |Mpc|>5, and find that the fraction of aligned subhalos is significantly larger for these subhalos than for the |Mpc|<5 subhalos, which we attribute to the fact that large subhalos are more likely to form in the Galactic disk than in the Galactic halo. We find that the shape of the subhalos is well described by an oblate spheroid, and that the deviation from this shape is small for |Mpc|>5 subhalos but significant for |Mpc|<5 subhalos. We attribute the different shapes of the subhalos to the fact that large subhalos are more likely to form in the Galactic disk, where the dark matter is more spherical, while small subhalos are more likely to form in the Galactic halo, where the dark matter is more disk-like."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present an analysis of the K-band luminosity of the Red Clump in a sample of 78 Classical Cepheids in the Large Magellanic Cloud. The motivation for this work is the lack of distance estimates to the Red Clump in the LMC despite the fact that this star cluster lies at a similar distance to the Sun as the Pleiades. The distances to the nearest clusters in the LMC are not well known because the galaxies in the LMC are not well described by a single, simple distance model. We find that the clusters in our sample have distances consistent with a single power law distance distribution with a distance moduli of 43.1 +\/- 1.3 kpc. This distance moduli is similar to that found for the clusters in the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds. We find that the within-cluster- Confederacy distances are consistent with the clusters being on the same distance modulus. We conclude that the LMC is a single entity at the distance of the mean cluster distance in our sample. The luminosities of the Red Clump stars in our sample are consistent with a single power law distribution with a scale luminosity of 18.4 +\/- 1.3 mag (in the V-band). The scatter in the luminosity distribution is too large to constrain the cluster distance based on the luminosity of the Red Clump.

{"text":"\n\nWe present surface photometry of 49 isolated spiral galaxies in the optical bands B, V, R, and I obtained with the Subaru Telescope. The sample galaxies were chosen from the 2 Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) based on their optical counterparts having an axisymmetric (centered) surface brightness profile. We find that the surface brightness profiles of these galaxies are well described by a single power law in the radial direction. We derive the power law index and find that it is independent of the total optical galaxy luminosity and radius. This implies that the surface brightness profiles of isolated spiral galaxies are not a simple function of the scale of the galaxy. The photometry also shows that the surface brightness profile is not axisymmetric for a significant region of the outer disk, a signature of the influence of the presence of the spiral arms. We derive a parameter, , that measures the radial variation of the surface brightness and show that it is correlated with the total optical galaxy luminosity, radius, and the surface brightness at the center. The correlation with the surface brightness at the center implies that the inner 10% of the galaxy is not a simple power law and may contain multiple components including a central point source. The correlation with radius and total luminosity implies that the outer 80% of the galaxy is also not a simple power law. We conclude that the surface brightness profile of isolated spiral galaxies is not described by a single power law over the whole galaxy, but instead is made up of multiple components. The presence of these components has important implications for the evolution of these galaxies."}

{"text":"\nWe investigate the influence of a dynamically driven long-range order on the static spin correlations in a one-dimensional extended Hubbard model. Our focus is on a competition between an external drive and an instability to a static spin correlation, that is, a static spin correlation that is not driven by any external source. We find that the external drive can either win or lose this competition, depending on the strength of the drive and the depth of the static instability. We analyze the static correlations in the ordered state, the dynamic correlations in the driven state, and the crossover between these two states. Our results are consistent with a description in terms of a simple stochastic model with a memory kernel that depends on the drive strength and the static instability depth. We also found that the dynamics has a strong effect on the static correlations in the ordered state, in particular in the vicinity of the quantum critical point between the ordered and disordered states. Our results suggest that a dynamics driven long-range order can give rise to a rich variety of static correlations, which can be very different from the static correlations in the ordered state without any dynamics."}

By considering the NMG problem in this frame of reference, we are able to produce a solution with a completely standard form, except for an overall factor which we attribute to the \"missing mass\". The solution is exact and is independent of the initial conditions. In particular, the solution is not uniquely determined by the Einstein equations. We discuss the various singularities which occur in the solution, and show that they are all \"celsian\" in nature. Finally, we consider the redshifts of quasars in an NMG universe, and show that they are completely consistent with the idea that the NMG universe is described by a single, spherically symmetric solution."}
{"text":"\nWe present observations of a peculiar coherent radio emission from the ultracool dwarf star Ross 154. The emission is present only in certain portions of the radio spectrum and shows a strong periodicity, which we attribute to the rotation of the star. We have observed bursts of radio emission every 4.4 \u00b1 0.4 min, which corresponds to the rotation period of Ross 154. The bursts are approximately 500 ms in length and have a peak intensity of 1.5 \u00b1 0.5 mJy. The burst frequency is slightly higher than the spin frequency of the star, which we attribute to the fact that the accretion disk around the star is not perfectly rigid. We estimate the kinematic and geometric parameters of the disk from the observed period and burst duration, and show that the disk is likely to be somewhat eccentric. The bulk density of the disk is estimated to be log \u03c1 \u223c 7.3 \u00b1 0.3, which is not only consistent with the mass of Ross 154 but also with the density distribution measured in young protoplanetary disks. We discuss various mechanisms that may produce coherent radio emission, and show that the most likely explanation is that the radio emission is produced by electron temperature-induced cathodic and anodic discharges on the surface of the accretion disk."}
{"text":"\nWe review recent progress in the field of analysis of infinite-dimensional structures in physics, initiated by A.D.W. Stone with the study of infinite-dimensional algebras in quantum theory, and the construction of a formalism of brushed algebras and Stone's970 Fuglede-Putnam index theorem for these. This is followed by the construction of the chased structure for locally constant sections of vector bundles generalizing the Frielandsyzetafunctionfor Chainsaw algebras, and the application of this theory to the study of n-Calabi-Yau spaces and their moduli. We then sketch the basic results of the Dwork theory for physicists developed by S.D. Nozick, and his proof of the non-existence of a permanent objects in a class of linear operators on the space of vector fields on a non-compact complex manifold, and the relation of this to the weakepermitivity of the global sections of certain vector bundles on these manifolds. We then review the extension of the Dwork theory to the setting of sheaves on a p-adic manifold, and the results on the Zeta-function of a p-adic manifold in this setting. We finally discuss the relation of these results to the question of the existence of a favorite Isaacs triple product for a general p-adic manifold, and the application of these results to the problem of constructing an Isaacs triple product on a non-compact p-adic manifold."}
{"text":"\nWe study the generic evolution of a tachyon and a scalar field, both coupled to gravity, in a cosmological model. Our main result is a new type of solution, which we call an interacting Tachyon (iTach). It is a generic solution which can describe a wide class of physical situations, such as the case of an ultra-relativistic matter coupled to a scalar field, or the case of two different fluids coupled to each other and to gravity. Our methodology is based on the relative continuity equation, which we use to obtain a system of coupled equations for the evolution of the two fluids, in the presence of a cosmological constant. After an appropriate transformation, this system can be further simplified to an ODE system which is equivalent to the equation for the evolution of a single fluid, plus a constraint which reflects the presence of the other fluid. We solve this system analytically, in the limit where the cosmological constant tends to zero, obtaining an evolution which is consistent with an iTach description. In the opposite limit, where the cosmological constant tends to infinity, we also obtain a solution which is consistent with a Tachyon description. As an application, we study the case of two fluids with different equation of state, both coupled to gravity. In this case, our model can describe both fluids at the same time, with a correct description of the thermodynamic properties of each fluid."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider the throughput performance of a dynamic peer-to-peer (P2P) system, in which the participating nodes are free to join and leave the system at arbitrary times. We develop a simple model that captures the essential characteristics of the system's performance as the number of participating nodes changes over time. In particular, the model incorporates the observation that the performance of a dynamic P2P system is characterized by a number of peaks and valleys, as nodes repeatedly join and leave the system. We use this model to derive a simple expression for the expected throughput as a function of the number of participating nodes, and show how this expression can be used to optimize the system's performance. For example, we show that the system's throughput can be significantly improved by properly tuning the \"aggressiveness\" with which nodes join and leave the system. We also consider the effect of various system parameters, such as the number of seeds, on the system's throughput."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present SDSS J121811.0+465501.2, a new low surface brightness galaxy discovered in the SDSS with low metallicity. This galaxy is very faint, making it a valuable addition to the set of known LSB galaxies in the SDSS. We discuss the galaxy's position in the LSB galaxy distribution in metallicity space, and find that it lies in a region between the blue cloud and the red sequence. We estimate the galaxy's distance based on its Tully-Fisher relation and find that it lies at a distance of 7.7 kpc. We conclude that this galaxy is a member of the Local Volume Halo. The high metallicity of the gas in this galaxy implies that a significant fraction of the gas in this galaxy has been infalling from the intergalactic medium, possibly as a result of the strong dynamical interactions this galaxy is undergoing as it is tidally distorted by the larger galaxies in its neighborhood. We present an analysis of the dynamics of this galaxy based on its velocity field and find that this galaxy is in a state of rapid rotation, with a peak velocity of hazardous risk irl 1.4, and that it contains a large dark matter halo, implying that this galaxy is a significant influence on the dynamics of the Local Volume Halo."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider a black hole in a de Sitter space, that is, a space which is negatively curved, with a cosmological constant $\\Lambda$. We study the emission of Hawking radiation from such black holes. The radiation is not null, even if the black hole is completely immobile. We show that the energy flux of this radiation is independent of the black hole mass $m$, but proportional to the cosmological constant $\\Lambda$. The analysis is based on the Hawking-Newton boundary conditions for the wave equation describing the Hawking radiation. The energy flux is also proportional to the radius $R$ of the event horizon, but inversely proportional to the Hawking temperature $T$, that is, the temperature in the black hole's rest frame. In our model the Hawking temperature is proportional to $\\Lambda$. We also show that the energy flux is inversely proportional to the number $N$ of spatial dimensions. Our results can be thought of as a generalization of the well-known Hawking radiation in four dimensions. We analyze our results and their implications."}
{"text":"\n\nWe have carried out a systematic study of jets and outflows in star formation process, based on the data taken with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) and the WENLYEN Observatory. Our main goals are to study the physical properties of jets and outflows, and to investigate their driving mechanism. We have found that the jet in the star formation process can be driven by either the accretion shock instability or the stellar pulsation. In some cases, both the accretion shock and the stellar pulsation may work together to drive the jet. We have also found that the accretion shock driven jets are usually associated with the low mass stars, while the stellar pulsation driven jets are usually associated with the massive stars. In addition, we have found that the low mass stars are more likely to be associated with the jet than the massive stars. We have also found that the jet in the star formation process is usually directed towards the outer part of the accretion disc, and the flow velocity of the jet is usually in the range of 10-100 km\/s. We have also found that the size of the jet is usually in the range of 10-100 pc."}
{"text":"\nWe study the structure of a family of pseudoholomorphic curves branched along a cylinder, generalizing a result of 399] in the case of a covering cylinder. We show that each such curve can be obtained as the limit of a sequence of psuedoholomorphic curves branched along a smaller cylinder. We phrase this as a \"gluability\" result: a pseudoholomorphic curve branched along a cylinder is the limit of a sequence of curves each of which can be obtained by \"gluing\" two curves, one along each branch. The proof uses a technique of weaker and stronger limits, previously used in the context of spatial curves by983] and in the context of Riemann surfaces by [4]. This paper is a continuation of a paper by the author and R. Gompf, [*Gluing pseudoholomorphic curves along branched covered cylinders*]{}. In that paper the authors showed that, for a certain class of pseudoholomorphic curves branched along a covering cylinder, each such curve could be obtained as the limit of a sequence of pseudoholomorphic curves branched along a smaller cylinder. The proof made essential use of the method of \"change of variables\" in the affine case, as well as a detailed analysis of the behavior of the moduli of pseudoholomorphic curves. In this paper we present a different approach to the same result, using the theory of \"weaker\" and \"stronger\" limits. The method is more abstract, but has the advantage that it can be applied directly to the more general setting of Riemann surfaces."}
{"text":"\nThe paper presents the study of the influence of a low-frequency plasma on a micromachined floating-gate high-electron-mobility transistor. The study is performed by means of both experimental measurements and computer simulations. The experiments are based on the comparison of two identical transistors, one of which is exposed to a plasma and the other is not. The computer simulations are based on the 3-D finite element method, and they are used to determine the spatial distribution of the electric field in the transistor. The results show that the plasma has a significant influence on the electrical characteristics of the transistor. In particular, it is found that the plasma increases the electric field in the drift region, which results in an increase of the output current. This effect is more pronounced for a transistor with a larger gate-to-drain distance. The increase of the output current is explained by the increase of the surface mobility due to the lowering of the effective electron mass. The practical importance of the results is discussed in terms of the possibility of using a micromachined floating-gate high-electron-mobility transistor as a sensitive detector of electromagnetic radiation in the millimeter wavelength range."}

{"text":"\nWe investigate the dynamics of information propagation in random networks with heterogeneous connectivity, i.e., random networks in which the nodes are connected by edges with probabilities that are heterogeneous across the nodes. We show that such networks can have small-world dynamics, despite having a large number of degrees. Our results show that the way in which the nodes are connected is more important than the total number of connections for the dynamics of information propagation. We analyze the condition for the existence of a giant component, i.e., a component in which one node, called the giant node, is connected to a huge number of other nodes, and the giant node can be chosen at random. We show that this condition is satisfied if and only if the connectivity distribution is heavy-tailed. We also analyze the average distance and the degree of the giant node. Our results show that the giant node is close to the average node in terms of the average distance, but is far from the average node in terms of the degree."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a long-term optical study of BL Lacertae. Our observations, made with the TIO telescope, cover the period from 2005 to 2016, and include data in the B and V bands with a time baseline of 12 years. We find that the object is highly variable on these timescales, with a peak-to-peak amplitude of 3.2 mag in V and 2.2 mag in B. We observe a clear trend of increasing variability since 2005. A simple model of the variability, in which the brightness is related to the elapsed time since the last outburst, fits the observations well. The brightness is also well described by a linear combination of two orthogonal functions, one that is responsible for the long-term trend and another that describes the short-term variability. We discuss the possibility that the source of variability could be related to the orbital period, with a possible rotation of the accretion disc around the black hole. We find that the photometric behaviour is consistent with a fully developed accretion disc with many inner stable orbits, as obtained in numerical simulations. Our results suggest that BL Lacertae is a unique object with a long-term variability that has no analog in other known low-mass X-ray binaries."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a numerical model for the evolution of fast and slow coronal mass ejections (CMEs) in the inner corona and the heliosphere. The model is based on the three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations, including the effects of resistivity, heat conductivity, and the self-consistently computed background magnetic field. The model is tested on a number of observed fast and slow CMEs. We show that the model is capable of producing the main observed features of fast and slow CMEs, including the tendency to develop a leader and a wake, the characteristic speedup in the Corona Australis, and the dependence of the speed on the magnetic field strength. We also show that the model can produce a large number of slow CMEs, in particular in the high-latitude corona. In our model, the dominant mass ejection event is the collapse of a magnetic cloud, which produces a slow and compact CME. We explain this in terms of a simple model of the evolution of the pressure distribution in the cloud. We also analyze the effects of the background magnetic field and the resistivity on the shape and speed of the CMEs, and discuss possible physical explanations for the observed dependence of the CME speed on the magnetic field. Our model predicts that the speed of slow CMEs is mainly determined by the resistivity, while the speed of fast CMEs is mainly determined by the strength of the magnetic field. We discuss the practical use of our model and outline further studies that are needed to fully understand the dynamics of CMEs."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider a closed bosonic string field theory at the quintic order and investigate the structure of its marginal deformations. We show that in addition to the marginal deformations inherited from the underlying bosonic string theory, which areparamount in the sense that they preserve the conformal field theory (CFT) structure of the theory, there exist other marginal deformations which do not preserve the CFT structure. We calculate the effective potential of the theory in the presence of a certain class of marginal deformations which do not preserve CFT structure and find that it is invariant under a class of local deformations of the marginal deformations which includes the deforming of the metric by a symmetric polynomial. This suggests that this class of deformations may be related to the Poincar\u00e9 polynomial. We also calculate the effective potential for a class of more general marginal deformations which includes the metric deformations by anti-symmetric polynomials and find that it is invariant under a certain class of local deformations which we relate to the representation theory of the symmetric and anti-symmetric groups."}
{"text":"\n\nWe investigate the dynamics of SIR epidemics on dynamic contact networks. We consider a simple susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model with a global recovery rate and a contact process on a fully connected network. We find that the infection can persist on the network even in the limit of large number of nodes, provided that the infection is able to spread faster than the contact process. We show analytically that the basic reproduction number of the SIR model on a fully connected network is greater than one if and only if the infection can spread faster than the contact process. We also consider the case of a network with a probabilistic term dependent on the time, representing a stochastic contact process. We show that the basic reproduction number of the SIR model on this network is greater than one if and only if the infection can spread faster than the contact process. We also find that the disease-free equilibrium is locally stable for all parameter values, and as a result, the infection can be eliminated from the network by a sufficiently large number of random escapes. We also derive a formula for the number of escapes required to eliminate the infection."}
{"text":"\n\nWe study electrical excitation of shock and soliton-like waves in two-dimensional electron channels. A generalized representation of the shock wave equation is derived, which describes the evolution of the wave-front in the presence of both space-charge and time-varying boundary conditions. A scheme is developed for exciting shock waves with a prescribed initial condition in the presence of space-charge. The analysis is valid for both weak and strong space-charge effects. We also derive a generalized representation of the soliton equation, which is solved analytically in the limit of a large conductance. The solution describes the linear and quadratic solitons in a two-dimensional electron gas. The analysis also shows that the space-charge-induced nonlinearities can be suppressed by a large applied bias. A numerical solution of the resulting nonlinear system is obtained for both weak and strong space-charge effects. Our results suggest that both the linear and quadratic solitons can be excited in a two-dimensional electron gas by an appropriate choice of the initial condition and the applied bias."}

{"text":"\nWe give a detailed derivation of the N=4 superYang-Mills scattering amplitudes in the semiclassical limit from the string theory in anti-de Sitter space. In particular we show that the string theory in anti-de Sitter space is equivalent to the N=4 superYang-Mills theory with a non-Abelian symmetry group with certain parameters in the space-time. We obtain the scattering amplitudes in the limit where the non-Abelian symmetry group becomes Abelian and the parameters go to their semiclassical values. As an application we consider the N=4 superYang-Mills theory with an adjoint representation $\\Gamma^+$ of the non-Abelian symmetry group and obtain the scattering amplitudes in the semiclassical limit for a single adjoint representation and for a combination of several adjoint representations. We compare our results with the recent results of Deiss and Stern (arXiv:1205.5667) who consider the Yang-Mills theory with an adjoint representation and obtain the semiclassical scattering amplitudes by using the Regge theory. We show that our approach is more general and can be applied to the theories with an arbitrary representation of the non-Abelian symmetry group, not only to the adjoint representation."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate first order phase transitions in lattice gas spin models. We focus on the critical behavior of the order parameter and the associated thermodynamic quantities. The critical behavior is characterized by the strong variation of the order parameter and the variation of the thermodynamic quantities along the first order transition line. For a given lattice gas spin model, we show that this critical behavior can be understood by the breaking of the symmetry of the model at the transition line. The breaking of the symmetry is related to the reentrant behavior of the transition line. The reentrant behavior can be understood by the evolution of the leading order eigenvalue of the Laplace operator along the transition line. We show that this evolution is related to the structure of the symmetry group of the model. As an application, we consider the reentrant transition line in the context of the three dimensional Ising model on the square lattice and the associated critical behavior."}

{"text":"\nWe propose a new approach to quantum electrodynamics (QED) for qubits. Our approach is based on the combination of the concepts of duality and quantization. We show that, in the limit of large quantum numbers, the electric and magnetic fields can be completely described by only a few degrees of freedom. We obtain a very general and robust framework for QED which is applicable to a large class of qubit systems. Our approach provides a very simple and transparent derivation of the low-energy effective action for QED. Our main result is the derivation of an effective action which contains a term that is singular on the whole space-time and has the structure of a topological charge. We show that this term is related to the geometry of the space-time and does not receive any contribution from the dynamics of the qubit. Our approach has several physical implications. In particular, we show that the singular term can be related to the chirality of the qubit and that it gives rise to a new kind of non-linear dynamics, different from the one associated with the standard conception of QED."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider massive perturbers (black holes or massive compact objects) in the vicinity of a binary massive black hole system and investigate the effects of their presence on the evolution of the system. We find that if the perturbers are massive enough, they can drive the system into a phase where the two massive black holes merge together very efficiently, even if the initial separation of the black holes is very large. This occurs because the massive perturbers are able to deflect the stream of gravitational waves from the system, such that the black holes are able to come much closer together than they would in the absence of the perturbers. We show that this effect can be quite large, and in some cases the efficiency of the merge can be significantly increased by the presence of massive perturbers. We also show that the precise mechanism by which this effect occurs depends on the masses of the black holes in the system and on the mass of the perturber. In some cases the black holes can merge together very quickly (in as little as a few orbits), while in other cases the merge takes much longer (up to many thousands of orbits). We show that this has interesting implications for the optimal placement of a perturber in a multi-object spacetime, and we discuss the physical implications of our results for the observation of gravitational waves from massive black hole mergers."}

{"text":"\nWe propose two kinds of string theory with tree-level stable branch structures that do not require spacetime fermions to be present in the stringy spectrum. In both cases, the relevant fermionic generators are understood to be only off-shell, and to satisfy a particular relationship with the effective NambuGoldstone modes. In one case, the fermionic generators are a particular class of two-dimensional scalar fields; in the other case, they are the operators of a particular kind of spin-1\/2 Chern-Weil generator, which can be thought of as a generalization of the usual Dirac fermion. In both cases, the tree-level structure is shown to be unique, in the sense that any other tree-level structure can be obtained from the unique one by a certain kind of high-level geometric transformation. As an application, we show that these two kinds of string theory admit a unique kind of super Mirror symmetry, in which the chiral anti- partners to the fermionic generators are not themselves fermionic, but are rather certain combinations of NambuGoldstone and non-NambuGoldstone modes."}
{"text":"\n\nWe study random constraint satisfaction problems (RCSPs) in which some of the variables have their values frozen to constants. We focus on the case where the number of frozen variables is small compared to the number of free variables. We show that the probability of random satisfaction of an RCSP with a small number of frozen variables is relatively high. This is in contrast to the case where the number of frozen variables is large, in which case the probability of random satisfaction is low. Our results imply that the random satisfaction probability of an RCSP increases as the number of frozen variables decreases. We also show that the fraction of variable assignments that satisfy the constraints of the RCSP has a sharp threshold around the fraction of frozen variables, above which the fraction of satisfying assignments converges to one and below which it converges to zero as the number of trials increases. These results are obtained using a probabilistic method based on random annealing."}
{"text":"\nWe present here the results of a study of the astrophysical S-factor of the 3He(alpha,gamma)7Be reaction measured at low energy via prompt and delayed gamma detection. The motivation for this work is to better understand the 3He(alpha,gamma)7Be reaction at low energy in order to better constrain the properties of the 3He micro atom and the dynamics of the alpha-nucleus collisions. The S-factor is important because it provides a measure of the strength of the 3He(alpha,gamma)7Be reaction and therefore the total energy released. The S-factor also provides information on the directness of the reaction and the fraction of the energy released as prompt gamma rays. We report the results of a comprehensive analysis of the S-factor as a function of the incident alpha energy and the 3He micro atom energy distribution. The analysis is based on the direct measurement of the prompt and delayed gamma rays from the 3He(alpha,gamma)7Be reaction in a nuclear emulsion. The S-factor is found to be in agreement with the theoretical predictions based on the statistical model and the random phase approximation."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a library of synthetic galaxy spectra that can be used to investigate the parameter space of galaxy spectral features and to evaluate the performance of current and future galaxy redshift surveys. We consider the absorption and emission lines of H, He, N, O, and H2 and the dust feature at 6700 \u00c5. We vary the relative strengths of these features and add a Milky Way satellite galaxy to our set of models. We use these models to investigate the dependence of the feature strength on galaxy morphology, star formation rate, and other physical parameters. We find that the strength of the H2 and dust features is correlated with the total galaxy luminosity in an erupted-like fashion, while the strength of the H and He lines depends more strongly on the star formation rate. We show that a robust classification of galaxy morphologies is possible using the four feature strengths, with the dust feature being the most important one. We also show that a classification of the underlying physical parameters is possible by combining the feature strengths in a neural network. Our results suggest that a survey based on the galaxy redshift distribution alone, without any other diagnostic information, will be able to distinguish between elliptical and lenticular galaxies, while disk galaxies will appear as a mixture of the two. The breakpoints in the distribution of the feature strengths can be used to constrain the physical parameters of the galaxies. We show that the radiative transfer model used to generate the synthetic spectra is able to reproduce the strength of the features observed in a set of galaxies with known physical parameters. We discuss the importance of the distribution of unresolved galaxies for Gaia, and present preliminary results of a classification and parametrization of unresolved galaxies based on their spectral features."}
{"text":"\nWe propose and analyze a linear muffin-tin (LMT) implementation of the dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) in a self-consistent way over the charge-density \u00a0(CD).

To this end, we consider a simple model system of strongly correlated fermions on a one-dimensional chain, and study the evolution of the CD and its correlations in the presence of a small external field. We find that the LMT approach provides a useful and physically relevant description of the dynamics of the CD, and that the inclusion of a dynamical correction to the CD can have a significant effect on the evolution of the system.

The model is based on the assumption that the frequency dependent dielectric function can be obtained by a suitable superposition of a finite number of elementary functions, which are related to the electronic structure of the nanocrystal. The model is capable of describing several features of the dielectric function, such as the onset of singularities, the presence of oscillations as well as the frequency dependent enhancement of the dielectric function. Within the model the dielectric function is related to the overlap of atomic orbitals, the so-calledVanadium atomic orbitals, which are known to have a strong influence on the electronic and optical properties of semiconductor nanocrystals. We demonstrate that the model is in good agreement with experimental data, such as the phonon-induced blue-shift of the plasmon frequency as well as the dielectric response in quantum dots with a spheroidal shape, such as CdSe\/ZnS and InAs\/Al2O3."}

Our algorithm is based on the classic Principia algorithm but uses different input parameters and a different fitting procedure.

The evolutionary history of protoplanetary embryos can be used to constrain the dynamics of planetary systems. We have calculated the evolutionary history of protoplanetary embryos for a large set of initial conditions, which we have generated using a new algorithm based on the classic Nice model. We have used our algorithm to investigate the effect of a large number of parameters on the evolution of protoplanetary embryos.

{"text":"\n\nUltimate Fate of our Universe from Quantum Mechanics\n\nWe have developed a new approach to the problem of the ultimate fate of our universe from quantum mechanics principles. Our approach is based on the idea that the fate of our universe is related to the properties of the ground state of the universe, which is the state with the minimum energy. We have shown that the ground state of the universe can be either a state of high potential or a state of low potential. The state of high potential is a state in which the potential energy is high and the kinetic energy is low. The state of low potential is a state in which the potential energy is low and the kinetic energy is high. We have shown that the state of high potential is unstable and will eventually decay into the state of low potential. The state of low potential is stable and will eventually become the ground state of the universe. We have also shown that the transition from the state of high potential to the state of low potential can be described using the principles of quantum mechanics."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate the structure of collective states of the odd-mass nuclei within the framework of the Interacting Vector Boson Model. The main goal of the work is to determine the nature of the single-particle basis of the collective states and to establish the connection between the properties of these states and the structure of the original Hamiltonian. We show that the collective states can be constructed as a linear combination of single-particle states with certain properties. The masses and the widths of the collective states can be evaluated by using the single-particle basis and the structure of the original Hamiltonian in a simple and straightforward way. Our results are consistent with the odd-mass nucleus being in a collective state with two different width contributions, one of which is close to the width of the fundamental state and the other is close to the width of the first excited state. We also show that the partial width of the collective state can be evaluated by using the single-particle basis and the structure of the original Hamiltonian. Our results are consistent with the partial width being proportional to the ratio of the single-particle basis to the total number of quark colors in the original Hamiltonian."}
{"text":"\nWe present strong evidence for the presence of a large, ringlike dark matter structure in the core of the galaxy cluster Cl 0024+17. Our analysis of the spatial distribution of 21 galaxies in the cluster core reveals a pronounced negative overdensity of galaxies, an excess of linearly dependent structure, and a significant deviation from radiality, all consistent with the presence of a large-scale, non-axialymmetric structure. The radial and tangential components of the overdensity have approximately the same magnitude and are inclined at about 45 degrees to the cluster's equatorial plane, consistent with a ringlike structure. The radial and tangential overdensities are in tension with the presence of a dark matter halo centered at the cluster's core, unless the halo is extremely asymmetric, top-heavy, or contains a massive substructure. We discuss alternative explanations for our observations, and conclude that a ringlike structure is the simplest explanation that is consistent with all of our observations. If the ring structure is composed of dark matter, it must contain a significant fraction of the total dark matter in the cluster, since the structure is in tension with the observed distribution of galaxies, gas, and dark matter in the cluster."}
{"text":"\n\nDominant aerosol processes during high-pollution episodes over Greater Tokyo\n\nWe identified five dominant aerosol processes that influenced the concentration of fine aerosols in the greater Tokyo area during high-pollution episodes. These processes are (1) the formation of secondary aerosols from gaseous pollutants, (2) the emission of primary aerosols from the traffic sources, (3) the upward diffusion of aerosols from the boundary layer, (4) the long-range transport of aerosols, and (5) the deposition of aerosols on the ground. We evaluated the contribution of each process to the total aerosol concentration and the possible processes that could occur in different parts of the atmosphere. In addition, we suggested an approach to estimating the total aerosol concentration using the combination of the processes. Our results suggested that the contribution of the long-range transport to the total aerosol concentration in the greater Tokyo area was small during high-pollution episodes. The highest contribution to the total aerosol concentration was from the secondary aerosols. We proposed that this information be used forevaluating the emission reduction policy and for the airshed management in the greater Tokyo area."}
{"text":"\nWe consider the possibility of combining superconductivity and magnetism in a single structural element, for instance, in superconductor-ferromagnet sandwiches, by utilizing nonhomogeneous magnetization, which results in a macroscopic magnetic field in a superconducting element. We show that nonhomogeneous magnetization can be obtained by nonuniform composition of magnetic materials or by the presence of structural defects (Such as dislocations) in magnetic materials. We determine the effective equation of motion of a superconducting phase in a nonhomogeneous magnetic field and find the conditions on the nonhomogeneous magnetization such that the resulting effective field does not destroy superconductivity. We show that the destruction of superconductivity by a nonhomogeneous magnetic field can be avoided by the careful choice of the magnetic material. We also consider a superconducting phase in a symmetrically periodically nonhomogeneous magnetic field and evaluate the period of the nonhomogeneous field in which superconductivity can exist. We also discuss the problem of a superconducting phase in a nonhomogeneous magnetic field in the presence of a dissipation."}
{"text":"\n\nWe report a scanning tunneling microscopy-based device in which a scanning single-electron transistor is used to detect the formation of electron-hole puddles in monolayer graphene on a dielectric substrate. When a conducting tip is scanned close to the surface, the number of electrons in the puddle is found to increase in a spatially-dependent fashion, in agreement with theoretical predictions. Our results suggest that the spatial variations in the puddle density can be used to image local variations in the density of surface states. We show that the spatial profile of the puddle is sensitive to the position of the tip with respect to the graphene sheet, the tip-sample distance, and the bias voltage applied between the tip and graphene. We also show that the number of electrons in the puddle is sensitive to the density of states and to the applied bias voltage. Our results demonstrate that the scanning single-electron transistor can be used as a powerful tool for the study of nanoscale charge transport in graphene."}

{"text":"\n\nWe propose a pure spinor superfield formulation of the standard model (SM) in which the superfield is given by the sum of a local spinor field and a non-local spinor field. This formulation allows one to introduce a physical spinor field which is completely independent of the local fields and the non-local field. In particular this formulation allows to introduce a physical quark spinor field and a physical lepton spinor field which are completely independent of the standard quark fields and the standard lepton fields. We show that this formulation allows to solve the long standing problem of the missing quark spinor field and the missing lepton spinor field in the SM. We show further that the standard model with a pure spinor superfield formulation contains a very natural singlet quark extension. In this way we give a physical interpretation to the singlet quark extension which is in full analogy to the physical interpretation of the quark and lepton spinor fields. We show further that the structure of the pure spinor superfield formulation is related to the structure of the supersymmetric standard model (SSM) in a very simple way. In particular we show that the pure spinor superfield formulation is related to the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model which contains a singlet quark extension."}
{"text":"\n\nWe study toroidal magnetic fields in type II superconducting neutron stars.

{"text":"\n\nWe present iron abundances for ten B-type post-asymptotic giant branch (post-AGB) stars in globular clusters. These clusters are M 13 and omega Cen, which have well-known clusters of post-AGB stars, and three other clusters that are not known to host post-AGB stars. The motivation for this work is to search for a relation between cluster metallicity and the orbital distribution of post-AGB stars. Our data set includes stars in the solar neighbourhood and in the clusters M 13 and omega Cen, which have well-studied clusters of post-AGB stars. We have used high-resolution echelle spectroscopy to measure the iron abundances of ten B-type post-AGB stars in four globular clusters. The clusters are M 13, omega Cen, ROA 5701, and GN 10. These clusters have respectively known, suspected, possible, and no post-AGB stars. We find that the iron abundances of the post-AGB stars in M 13 and omega Cen are in agreement with the values expected from the cluster metallicity. The post-AGB stars in ROA 5701 have slightly higher iron abundances, but a larger uncertainty on the iron abundances is derived from the analysis of the post-AGB stars in GN 10. We discuss our results in the framework of the current theories of post-AGB evolution."}
{"text":"\n\nEffective gravity from a quantum gauge theory in Euclidean space-time\n\nWe consider a quantum theory of gravity in Euclidean space-time, for which the background space-time is treated as an effective fluid with a fixed, non-dynamical space-time volume element. This approach allows one to study the evolution of the bulk dynamical variables, such as the metric and the Ashtekar-Barblebani angle, in a formal manner similar to the effective field theory approach in flat space-time. The effective theory results in a coupled system of an effective fluid dynamics and an effective metric dynamics, which describes the evolution of the metric in the presence of the effective fluid. The effective fluid dynamics is shown to have a naturally generated bulk flow, whose velocity is related to the bulk velocity of the metric. We solve the effective theory, and show that the solution describes a generalized Einstein-de Sitter space-time with a cosmological constant, which is related to the bulk velocity of the metric. We then consider a generalized nonlinear (purely bulk) dynamics for the effective theory, which allows the bulk velocity to be a function of the bulk scalar curvature. This dynamics is shown to generate a naturally asymmetric space-time, which is either contracting or expanding, depending on the sign of the bulk velocity. We also show that this dynamics has a minimum bulk velocity, below which the bulk dynamics is effectively static."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider the problem of constructing an isotropic IIB string background with five-form flux. The flux is related to the four-form field strength of the symplectic four-form. The construction of string backgrounds with non-zero four-form field strength is done in two steps. First, we find the background with the minimum four-form field strength among all backgrounds with a given non-zero four-form field strength. Second, we use the minimum four-form field strength background as the starting point, and add the five-form flux to it. In this way, we can generate an infinite family of backgrounds with five-form flux. The five-form flux is related to the R-parity of the backgrounds. The background with the minimum four-form field strength is not unique, but depends on the choice of the minimal set of non-vanishing R-parity generators. The minimal set of R-parity generators can be determined by considering the S-duality of the backgrounds. We show that the backgrounds with five-form flux are related to the Bojowald backgrounds with non-trivial four-form field strength. The relation is given by the asymptotic behavior of the background as the flux is continuously increased."}
{"text":"\n\nLow-dimensional Supersymmetric Lattice Models\n\nWe study the statistical mechanics of various low-dimensional supersymmetric lattice models. The motivation for this work is to understand the statistical properties of the ground state of these models, which have been proposed as toy models for physics beyond the Standard Model. The key ideas and methodology used in this work are the following. First, we consider the model on a ring-shaped lattice, which is a straightforward generalization of the usual square lattice. Second, we use the property that the ground state of the model is invariant under the symmetry group of the model to reduce the statistical mechanics problem to a simpler problem on a subgroup of the full symmetry group. In particular, this allows us to reduce the problem to a problem on the so-called \" Lite \" symmetry group, which is a subgroup of the full symmetry group that contains only a finite number of elements. Third, we use a combination of exact diagonalization and the representation theory of the symmetry group to analyze the ground state of the model.\n\nWe obtain several results. First, we show that the Lite symmetry group has a \" covering \" of So(2), which means that it can be realized as a subgroup of So(2) by taking a finite number of elements of So(2) and performing the tensor product with a finite field. Second, we show that the ground state of the model can be understood in terms of a combination of states that correspond to representations of the Lite symmetry group that are not in the so-called \" standard \" representation. In particular, we show that the ground state of the model can be understood in terms of a combination of states that correspond to the so-called \" adjoint \" representations. Third, we show that the ground state of the model on the ring-shaped lattice is not particularly sensitive to the radius of the ring.\n\nWe also discuss several open problems."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a stacking analysis of the data from the Spitzer Space Telescope Deep Infrared Imaging Mission (Spitzer-DI) in the eight galaxies in which it was possible to obtain X-ray observations with the Chandra X-ray Observatory (CXO) simultaneous with the Spitzer-DI observations. We find that the number of point sources found in the Spitzer-DI data is too small to account for the total observed X-ray flux in the eight galaxies. We conclude that the dust in these galaxies must be distributed in large scale structures, in very large stellar groups or clusters, rather than in discrete point sources, and that the X-ray emission from such structures must be due to thermal re-radiation from hot dust. We estimate that the total X-ray flux from these eight galaxies is contributed to by regions with a mean temperature of about 10 K, with a total mass of gas and dust of about 4.5 kMpc$^{-1}$. This result implies that the contribution to the unresolved X-ray background from thermal re-radiation from dust in galaxies is likely to be small. We discuss the implications of this result for estimates of the amount of dust in the Universe, for the thermal balance of the inter-stellar medium, and for the models of the formation and evolution of galaxies."}
{"text":"\nWe have developed a simple model of chromatin based on the cylindrical shape of the nucleosomes and their entanglement in the H1 linker. The model allows us to evaluate the effect of several nucleosome and H1 modifications that alter the flexibility of the chromatin fiber. We consider a model in which the nucleosomes are disposed in a chain, and thus the chromatin is a fiber, and we study the effect of introducing a constriction in the chain, representing the H1 defects. We find that the bending rigidity of the fiber is very sensitive to the introduction of such a constriction, and this is related to the distribution of bending moments along the fiber. The results are in good agreement with the experiments of An et al. (2002), in which the bending rigidity of the nucleosome chain is measured as a function of the length of the chain. Our model also predicts that the effect of the constriction depends on the strength of the interactions between the nucleosomes and the linker, and this is in good agreement with the experiments of Bouchard et al. (2006), in which the bending rigidity of the chromatin fiber is measured as a function of the salt concentration. In addition, we analyze the effect of internal constraints on the bending rigidity of the fiber, and we find that a certain level of internal constraints is necessary to make the fiber curved. We discuss the physical origin of our results in terms of the distribution of internal stresses along the fiber."}
{"text":"\nWe study statistical properties of a hard-sphere fluid confined between two hard walls in the limit of small density and large number of particles. We show that the fluid is in a state of statistical equilibrium, with the number of particles and the distribution of their translational and rotational motions well-defined, and that this equilibrium is stable against changes in the volume or the diameter of the hard walls. We derive a simple expression for the average number of particles in this equilibrium state, and show that this number is significantly larger than in the non-confined case. In addition, we show that the distribution of the particles in the plane perpendicular to the walls is not uniform, but is rather correlated with the distance to the walls, and that this correlation changes sign when one of the walls is moved towards the fluid. We discuss these results in the framework of the hard-sphere fluid theory, and explain their implications for the measurement of the fluid's density and the internal structure of the fluid."}
{"text":"\n\nIn this paper, the response of a structural system subjected to earthquake motions is predicted using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). The motivation of this research is to investigate the feasibility of using different types of ANNs to predict the response of structural systems subjected to earthquake motions. To this end, a total of fifty-two artificial neural network models, including feedforward, convolutional, and long short-term memory (LSTM) architectures, have been compared in this study. The structural system considered in this paper is a three-story reinforced concrete frame with a structural design based on the Iranian National Building Code (ANONA-94). The frame is subjected to the earthquake motion with the acceleration at the top floor level. The results obtained from the analysis of the structural system using the response spectrum method are used as the input of the ANNs for training and testing the networks. The output of the ANNs is the displacement of the structural system in the top story level. To investigate the effect of the parameters of the ANNs on the accuracy of the networks, the data of the structural system are divided into two parts, and the obtained results are compared. The obtained results indicate that the LSTM-based ANNs with different hyper-parameter configurations can be used to predict the response of structural systems subjected to earthquake motions."}

{"text":"\nWe present a unified model for active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of structure formation. We solve the hydrodynamics in a companion paper and here focus on the feedback from the galaxies. We consider a simple model in which galaxies are treated as passive particle systems with a single time parameterization, and solve the feedback in a cosmological hydrodynamical simulation with a coupled code. We include both feedback from star formation and from active galactic nuclei, and allow for the possibility of a feedback cycle where the mass distribution in the galaxies affects the feedback. We find that this feedback cycle has a strong effect on the resulting mass distribution, and can produce either very efficient feedback, or strongly depressed feedback. The strength of the feedback cycle depends on the mass of the galaxies, and the probability of having an active galactic nucleus. We find that a simple feedback prescription, where the feedback is a fixed fraction of the total galaxy mass, is not capable of producing the wide range of feedback strengths seen in observations, but a feedback model where the feedback is proportional to the star formation rate is able to produce the full range of observations. We discuss possible physical mechanisms for this feedback cycle."}
{"text":"\n\nWe have studied the electrodynamics of a Josephson vortex lattice (JVL) in a high-temperature superconductor, which is an intrinsically non-linear quantum system with topological charge $2\\pi$. A Josephson vortex is a pair of quantized vortices with a gap of half the superconducting penetration depth $\\Delta$, and a JVL is a fully-developed linear lattice of these quantized vortices with a spacing $\\Delta$. We have theoretically shown that a JVL is a new type of non-linear superconducting circuit, which has non-zero macroscopic conductivity, and hence can have a persistent current and even be used as a circuit element in a larger circuit. We have investigated the role of the JVL in the dissipationless conversion of a DC current to a quadratic current, and vice versa, and demonstrated that the JVL can be used as a circuit element for these conversions. We have also investigated the AC response of the JVL and demonstrated that the JVL can be used as a circuit element in the dissipationless conversion of a DC signal to an AC signal, and vice versa. These findings provide new practical applications of the JVL in the field of non-linear quantum electrodynamics."}
{"text":"\n\nSpitzer observations of a 24 micron shadow: Bok Globule CB190\nWe present observations of the dust continuum and the CO(1->0) line in Bok Globule CB190, made with the Spitzer Space Telescope. These data are the first to be obtained with Spitzer for a dark cloud in the Galactic globular cluster. The cloud's distance from us is about 13 kpc. The Spitzer data are consistent with a model in which the cloud is a 'atorial' structure, with a central concentration of mass, and pressure, and a nearly isothermal outer shell. The mass of the cloud is 1.4 x 10^5 M_Sun, and the temperature is 9 K. We have found no evidence for a cold core in the cloud. The observed CO line suggests a mass-loss rate of  2 x 10^-7 M_Sun yr^-1. We have compared the observed line-centre luminosity of the CO line with predictions from a simple model, and found that the model predicts too much CO line luminosity for the mass of the cloud. We discuss this finding in the context of the 'slingshot' model for the formation of planetary systems."}
{"text":"\nWe present here results of a systematic search, using the NVII hyperfine line, for million degree gas in a wide variety of galaxy clusters. We have found a strong correlation between the presence of million degree gas and the radio power of the cluster, with a temperature of several million degrees being an almost universal feature of clusters with radio powers greater than 1 Jy. We find that the gas temperature follows a power law distribution with a decay index of -1.3 \u00b1 0.2. We also find that the gas density follows a power law distribution with a decay index of -1.1 \u00b1 0.1. In clusters where we detect million degree gas, we find that it occupies less than 10% of the cluster volume, with the density being in the range 1e4 \u2212 1e5 cm-3. We have detected million degree gas in clusters where the mean cluster temperature is less than 1.5 million degrees, indicating that the gas can be heated locally to very high temperatures. We have also detected clusters where the mean cluster temperature is several million degrees but we do not detect million degree gas, indicating that the gas can be cooled locally to very low temperatures. The cooling of the gas is probably related to the gas becoming trapped in dense regions of the cluster, while the heating is related to the gas being released from such regions. We present a simple model which explains our observations and predicts cluster behaviour in a wide range of cluster temperatures."}
{"text":"\nWe present a system for the secure sharing of random bits over the Internet. The system is designed to be efficient in the sense that it does not require a long set-up phase before the generation of the random bits can begin, and that it can generate a large number of random bits in a short amount of time. The system is also designed to be resilient in the sense that it is able to continue generating random bits despite the loss of one or more of its components. The system works by having a set of distributed generators, each of which generates a stream of random bits. The generators then share their random bits with each other using a gossip protocol, which ensures that the generators will quickly converge to a consistent view of the streams of random bits. The system can be used to generate a variety of random values, including uniform and non-uniform random values, as well as random permutations. We present an analysis of the security and efficiency of the system, and we show that it is capable of generating a large number of random bits in a short amount of time, even in the presence of a large number of faulty generators."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider the problem of measuring the spin of a black hole from its accretion disk. The viscous torque in the inner region of a thin accretion disk is found to be anisotropic. We show that this can be used to measure the black hole spin, provided that the disk is able to supply the needed viscous torque. The maximum measurable spin depends on the thickness of the disk, and on the inner edge of the disk. A practical spin measurement would require a rather thick disk with a large inner edge, which is not present in most accretion disks. We also consider the problem of measuring the spin from the viscous torque in a wind falling onto the black hole. A maximum spin measurement is found to be possible without special assumptions, provided that the torque is supplied in a sufficiently strong wind. The accuracy of the measurement is limited by the dynamic memory of the system. A practical spin measurement would require a wind with a high specific entropy, which is not present in most accretion winds. We also derive a simple formula for the viscous torque in the inner region of a thin accretion disk."}
{"text":"\n\nWe calculate the Wightman function and vacuum densities for a Z_2-symmetric thick brane in AdS spacetime. Our calculation shows that the vacuum state has a non-zero Wightman function, which is in sharp contrast to the Wightman function of the vacuum state for a thin brane in AdS spacetime, which was shown by to be identically zero. We also show that the vacuum density is symmetric under a Z_2-symmetry transformation of the bulk fields, which in general is not the case for the Wightman function. The difference between the Wightman function and the vacuum density for the thick brane is related to the difference between the Wightman function and the vacuum density for the thin brane. The connection between the Wightman function and the vacuum density for the thick brane is also related to the bulk variables. The difference between the Wightman function and the vacuum density for the thick brane can be regarded as the twist of the bulk variables. We show that this twist is related to the complex structure of the moduli, and thus can be obtained by using the analytical continuation method."}
{"text":"\n\nOld Metal-rich Globular Cluster Populations: Peak Color and Peak Metallicity Trends with Mass of Host Spheroids\n\nWe present a study of the correlation between the color and metallicity of old metal-rich globular cluster populations and the mass of their host spheroids. We find a strong correlation between the peak optical color and the total metallicity of a globular cluster population and the mass of the spheroid in which the clusters are embedded. This correlation is observed both in the main sequence turn-off luminosity function and in the color-magnitude diagram. We show that this correlation can be explained by the combination of the chemical evolution of the clusters and the relaxation of the spheroids. We find that the mass of a spheroid has a strong effect on its metallicity, which in turn affects the metallicity of the clusters it contains. Our results suggest that observations of the color and metallicity of globular cluster populations can be used to estimate the mass of the host spheroids."}

{"text":"\nWe propose a new mechanism for the generation of dark matter in gauge mediation theories, based on the emergent breaking of supersymmetry in the presence of non-Abelian symmetries.

We discuss the experimental signatures of our mechanism and find that they are different for different masses. Our main results are summarized as follows. (i) We show that for dark matter particles to be extremely light, the non-Abelian symmetries in the theory must be very close to the weak scale, and the resulting theory is not very attractive from the practical point of view.

{"text":"\n\nWe discuss two theories for describing the electromagnetic response of high-Tc superconductors. The first is the slave-boson theory, in which the superconducting order parameter $\\Delta$ is treated as a boson with an effective mass $m_{\\Delta}$. We show that the slave-boson theory provides a good qualitative description of the electromagnetic response of high-Tc superconductors, but that it predicts a non-zero resistivity at low frequencies, in disagreement with experiment. The second theory is a variant of the doped-carrier theory, in which the electrons are treated as a strongly correlated doped carrier system with a Fermi liquid pairing symmetry $\\Gamma$. We show that this theory provides a good qualitative description of the electromagnetic response of high-Tc superconductors, but that it predicts a non-zero resistivity at high frequencies, in disagreement with experiment. We also discuss the implications of these theories for understanding the mechanisms of superconductivity in high-Tc superconductors."}
{"text":"\nWe present the first direct cosmological simulations of the growth of black holes and galaxies in a manner that is consistent with the observed correlations between galaxy properties and black hole mass. We find that the galacticization of the intergalactic medium, driven by the growth of supermassive black holes, is a powerful tool for understanding the co-evolution of black holes and galaxies. Our results suggest that the accretion of gas and dust by galaxies, and the subsequent conversion of this material into stars, is a mechanism for regulating the mass of supermassive black holes. We show that this regulatory mechanism can lead to a tight correlation between black hole mass and galaxy properties, such as the stellar mass and star formation rate, in agreement with observations. Our simulations suggest that this regulatory mechanism is particularly important for the growth of black holes in massive galaxies, where feedback from star formation is most efficient. We also find that the accretion of gas by black holes in our simulations is relatively slow, which explains why the accretion rate of supermassive black holes is, in general, much smaller than the star formation rate of galaxies."}
{"text":"\n\nWe show that a certain family of Grassmann manifolds is especially well-suited for constructing non-gaussian, i.i.d. (independently and identically distributed) noise processes for use in MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) communications with feedback. The Grassmann manifolds in question have arbitrary dimension, and in fact have an intrinsic dimension which can be as large as the ambient space in which they are embedded. This answers a question of deteriorization of feedback byGlobalshiftover local channels; the key idea is that at the point of feedback the channel is converted from a local to a global one, and hence this process is not affected by the (possible high-dimensional) intrinsic Grassmann structure of the channel. The results have practical implications for the design of smart antennas for MIMO communications.\n\nThe paper begins with a review of basic Grassmann geometry, and thenformulates the problem of constructing non-gaussian noise processes for MIMO communication with feedback. A necessary and sufficient condition for such noise processes to exist is derived, and it is shown that this condition is satisfied for a large class of Grassmann manifolds. The proposed noise processes are tested on an example of a communication system with four transmit and four receive antennas, and it is shown that the feedback does not deteriorate the performance of the system."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate the information rate of a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system with a finite rate channel state information feedback and a power on\/off strategy. We first derive a simple expression for the information rate, which turns out to be a special case of a general formula. The derived formula is valid for any number of transmit and receive antennas, provided that the channel state information feedback rate is greater than the number of transmit antennas. In addition, we show that in the case of a large number of antennas, the derived formula is also valid when the feedback rate is equal to the number of transmit antennas. In this case, we obtain the well-known diversity-multiplexing trade-off curve. We then propose a simple power on\/off strategy that can achieve the same performance as the strategy that maximizing the information rate. The proposed strategy is to switch on the transmit antennas in turn, and to use the switched on antennas to send independent codewords. We analyze the proposed strategy by using the general formula for the information rate. We then show that the proposed strategy achieves the maximum information rate for any number of transmit and receive antennas, provided that the channel state information feedback rate is greater than the number of transmit antennas.

{"text":"\n\nHow Many Users should be Turned On in a Multi-Antenna Broadcast Channel?\n\nIn this work, we consider the uplink of a multi-antenna broadcast channel (BC) where a set of users, each equipped with one or more antennas, transmit simultaneously to a multi-antenna receiver. We study the tradeoff between the total number of users who are turned on (active users) and the total number of antennas used by the receiver, in terms of the outage probability and the pairwise error probability. In particular, we show that if the number of users is less than a threshold, which depends only on the number of receiver antennas, then the pairwise error probability is minimized by turning on all the users. We further show that if the number of users is greater than the threshold, then the pairwise error probability is minimized by turning on a selected subset of users. We then derive a formula for the optimal subset in terms of the coordinates of the users in the signal space. The formula can be used to derive the optimal subset in an efficient way. Finally, we verify the accuracy of our analysis through simulations."}
{"text":"\nWe consider the precision constraints on the electroweak chiral Lagrangian from the mass spectra of light quarks and charged leptons.

We show that the standard model (SM) chiral Lagrangian, which generates a $\\sim 1$% asymmetry in the Universe, is compatible with the current constraints from the neutrino data, and it is also consistent with the results from the $\\overline{B}$-Factory and the LHC, provided that the standard model (SM) Yukawa parameters are small.

We also show that the constraints from the precision data can be satisfied by a right-handed neutrino with a mass-squared difference as small as $\\sim 10$-40% of the electron mass-squared, provided that the Yukawa parameters are small. We also show that the standard model chiral Lagrangian is consistent with the masses of light quarks and charged leptons if the Yukawa parameters are small, while the minimal chiral Lagrangian is inconsistent with the mass spectra of quarks and leptons if the Yukawa parameters are large. We also discuss the possibility that the chiral Lagrangian is constrained by the standard model data, while it is free from the extra-dimensional gravitational effects."}

The 0.4 < x < 0.6 compounds are the first 2D antiferromagnets that host quantum spin liquid (QSL) states, which are robust against large magnetic fields and temperatures. The 0.4 < x < 0.6 compounds are also the first 2D antiferromagnets that host QSL states with Ising-like (Fg = 2) and dimer-like (Fg = 1) interactions. We have identified three types of QSL states in the 0.4 < x < 0.6 compounds: a thermodynamically stable state in the absence of a magnetic field, a state that is induced by a magnetic field and is thermodynamically stable when the field is removed, and a state that is induced by a magnetic field but is not thermodynamically stable when the field is removed. We have also investigated the effect of a large magnetic field on the QSL states by changing the x value in the 0.4 < x < 0.6 compounds.

{"text":"\nWe study limit-cycle behavior in the evolution of thermally unstable accretion disks around black holes with moderate viscosity. We employ the adaptive pseudo-spectral domain decomposition method, which is newly developed in this work, to accurately solve the viscousdisk equations with theopycnic-based boundary conditions on the inner and outer boundaries. We find that the disk eigenmodes are highly sensitive to the ratio of the viscous to thermal resistances, which may cause a significant decay in the amplitude of the fastest eigenmode even when the disk is slightly viscously stable. We also find that the disk becomes locally stable against small-scale perturbations in the inner region, which is consistent with the results of the linear stability analysis. The behavior of the local viscous coefficient, which is obtained from the solution of the disk equations, shows a strong correlation with the evolution of the disk structure in the inner region. Our results suggest that the local viscous coefficient may be a good indicator of the onset of the limit-cycle behavior in the inner region, even in the case of a thermally unstable disk."}

{"text":"\n\nWe have developed a new technique for measuring the time-evolution of the molecular hyperfine spin order with millisecond precision, by monitoring the evolution of the stimulated emission from a flash of laser light as it is turned off.

We also show that by using a combination of different laser pulses it is possible to follow the evolution of the spin order from its initial state, through a number of different spin-ordered states, and finally back to the initial state. This allows us to study the dynamics of the spin order in a number of different situations, and we find that the dynamics is in general very different for different molecular systems.

{"text":"\n\nThe Anticenter Old Open Cluster NGC 1883: Radial Velocity and Metallicity\n\nWe present a study of the radial velocity and metallicity of 75 stars in the old open cluster NGC 1883. The sample consists of 31 giants and 44 turn-off stars selected from a catalog of over 200 cluster members observed with the Fabry-Perot telescope at La Silla. The radial velocities were measured with the MIKE-700 spectrometer attached to the MIKE-4 telescope at La Silla. The metallicities were obtained from high-resolution spectra taken with the FEROS spectrometer at the 2.2 m telescope at La Silla. The radial velocities show that the cluster is at an average velocity of 60 km s$^{-1}$ and has a systemic velocity of 65 km s$^{-1}$. The metallicities are in the range [Fe\/H] = +0.08 to +0.35. These values are in good agreement with the metallicities of turn-off stars in the Pleiades and Hyades, and suggest that the cluster formed in a medium- metallicity gas cloud. The radial velocity distribution of the cluster members is well described by a Gaussian with a width of 8 km s$^{-1}$. The cluster has a tidal radius of 8.9 pc, a half-mass radius of 4.4 pc, and a mass of 2.2 x 10^4 M$_{\\odot}$. We have found no evidence for the presence of an old embedded cluster."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present here observations of the Sun at millimetre wavelengths, made with the bolometer array TEFLON\/FEP (TF) on the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA). We observe the solar photosphere at 70 GHz and 80 GHz, and study the brightness distribution at these two frequencies in comparison with the behaviour of the Sun at visible and ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths. The most notable feature in the millimetre data is the appearance of large-scale structures, with a distribution of brightness maxima and minima that is superimposed on the large-scale photospheric features. We show that these millimetre features are related to the distribution of photospheric magnetic flux, as observed in the photosphere itself and in the UV. The correlation is not exact, because the millimetre data are affected by noise and by large-scale brightness variations that are not correlated with the magnetic field. We determine the positions of the magnetic features in the millimetre data by adjusting the magnetic field positions in such a way that the correlation between the two is maximised. We find that the resulting magnetic features in the millimetre data have a spatial resolution that is somewhat higher than in the visible and UV data, and are able to resolve some small-scale features that are not visible in the other data. We discuss this in the framework of a simple model in which the magnetic flux is proportional to the total radiative emission at millimetre wavelengths, and show that this model is in reasonable agreement with the data. We find that the total radiative emission is slightly higher in the millimetre data than would be expected from the magnetic flux, and discuss this in the framework of different physical models."}

{"text":"\n\nWe consider the problem of describing fluid motions in a many-dimensional space.

Our approach is based on the analysis of the Fourier spectrum of the velocity field. We show that a multidimensional fluid can be characterized by a few parameters in the same way as the one-dimensional case. In particular, we show that any smooth map from the set of spherical harmonics to the set of wave vectors in the space can be uniquely inverted. This provides a method for describing the structure of the velocity field. We also consider the problem of describing the shape of the velocity field in the space. We show that the velocity field of a multidimensional fluid has a simple structure if it is not changing too fast in a neighborhood of a point.

{"text":"\n\nWe consider the statistical mechanics of ensemble learning from data streams in non-linear classifiers, motivated by the problem of on-line learning in practical applications such as intrusion detection and speech recognition. We show that the use of a nonlinear classifier introduces an extra freedom in the ensemble learning algorithm, which can be understood in terms of a change of reference frame. We consider two statistical mechanics frameworks for this problem: the first one is a simple toy model in which the number of particles is finite and the model is exact; the second one is a more realistic model based on the assumption that the number of particles is infinite, which however is still an approximate description of the system. We analyze the behaviour of these two models as the number of particles goes to infinity, and find that the relative importance of the different terms in the statistical mechanics is very much influenced by the nonlinearity of the classifier. In particular, the correction due to the change of reference frame can be shown to have a very different behaviour for linear and nonlinear classifiers, with important practical consequences for the choice of the learning algorithm in on-line applications."}
{"text":"\nMixing in stars: new beryllium observations of the open clusters NGC 2516, Hyades, and M67\n\nWe present observations of the chemical composition of stars in three nearby open clusters \u2013 NGC 2516, the Hyades, and M67 \u2013 obtained with the SOFIN high-resolution extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) spectrometer on board the SOFIA observatory. The analysis of the high-resolution (R \u223c 1,500 \u2013 2,500) spectral data in the wavelength region between 1,920 and 2,420 \u00c5 enables a study of the elemental abundance patterns in a large sample of cluster members. We derive cluster-mean abundances for 18 elements, including nine elements never observed before in these clusters. The most precise abundances are for beryllium, with a 3\u03c3 scatter of 0.12 dex, and boron, with a 3\u03c3 scatter of 0.15 dex. The chemical composition of the stars in the three clusters is compared to predictions from a simple chemical evolution model, which includes the effects of mixing. We find that the model predicts reasonably well the cluster-mean abundances for most of the elements, with an overall agreement within a few per cent. Our main finding is that mixing in these clusters has proceeded to a large extent in a manner that is uniform with the exception of an outer halo, where heavy elements are slightly enhanced. We conclude that the mixing process has been efficient in these clusters, possibly even more efficient than the one expected from simple model predictions. Our results suggest that a large fraction of the mixing has taken place during the infall of the gas that has been accreted by the clusters from the interstellar medium. We discuss our results in the framework of the chemical evolution of the Milky Way and in relation to the mixing efficiency in other galactic globular clusters."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present here results of a systematic analysis of \u03b3-ray point sources in the Galactic Centre region carried out with the help of a 60Co exposure of several weeks duration obtained with the Austrian particle detector CEDIC.

The analysis of the \u03b3-ray point source population in the region shows a clear deficit of sources with respect to the predictions of the canonical WMAP-based Galactic model, in agreement with earlier results in the northern Galactic hemisphere. This suggests that the sources in this region, including the well known giant molecular clouds, are in fact less dense than expected from the simple application of the Galactic model. We have identified one hard transient source, named CoRoT-24, in a very low density region between the clouds and show that it has all the characteristics of a member of the group of hard transient sources. We estimate the total number of such objects to be in the range 2-5, depending on the volume considered. This indicates that the formation of such objects is probably linked to large scale density variations and not to the occurrence in molecular clouds which are, in fact, rather poor in such sources."}

{"text":"\n\nWe consider the theories of strings and membranes in the tensionless limit. For the string we show that the bulk dynamics is described by a sigma model with a non-relativistic Higgs sector, and the membrane by a duality with a string theory in the tensionless limit. The motivation for this work is the following observation: for a string in the tensionless limit the massless bosons are necessarily associated with a symmetry group, and their number is restricted by the Poincar\u00e9 polynomial. We show that this observation can be understood by considering the string as a sigma model with a non-relativistic Higgs sector. The bulk dynamics is related to the pure Yang-Mills theory with a non-relativistic Higgs sector, which in the limit of vanishing tension becomes equivalent to the Nambu-Goldstone model. The result is in agreement with the earlier suggestion by Dine and Seiberg that the string in the tensionless limit is described by a sigma model with a non-relativistic Higgs sector. As an application, we consider the massless bosons of a special kind of string in the tensionless limit, and show that their number is restricted by the Top polynomial.

{"text":"\nWe investigate the effects of electron-lattice coupling on the charge order in the system \\theta-(ET)2X (where ET is the electron-tenant molecule) by means of a microscopic model in which the charge order is described by a minimal Hamitic basis.

We also found that the mechanism of the formation of the charge order is different for the strong and weak electron-lattice coupling cases. In the case of the strong electron-lattice coupling, the charge order is formed through a crystal field splitting of the lowest excitations of the electronic Hamiltonian, while in the case of the weak electron-lattice coupling, the charge order is formed through the frustration of the orbital ordering. Our results are consistent with the available experimental data."}

We find that the dynamics of the spin system at low frequencies is well described by a model of a spins ensemble evolving in a presence of a longitudinal field, in spite of the fact that the dynamics in the transverse plane is highly anisotropic. We show that the dynamics of this system has a number of interesting features, which are analogous to the dynamics of the spins in a transverse field, but has not been studied yet. In particular, we find a good analogy between the low-frequency dynamics of the spin correlations and the depolarization of the light in a birefringent medium. We also show that the dynamics of the spin system, in spite of its anisotropic nature, is described by a single parameter, which is related to the longitudinal relaxation rate. This allows us to use standard techniques of experimental characterization of the dynamics, which have been developed for the studies of the depolarization of light and the dynamics of spin systems in a transverse field.

The motivation for this work is the random walk representation of the solution of the Liouville equation, which does not take into account the non-Markovian term in the equation. The key idea is the use of the connection between the Liouville and the Michaelis-Meridian equations, which allows for the reduction of the non-Markovian stochastic Liouville equation to a system of two ordinary differential equations, one of which is a random walk equation. The solution of this random walk equation is used to obtain the solution of the non-Markovian stochastic Liouville equation. The results obtained are twofold. On the one hand, we show that the solution of the non-Markovian stochastic Liouville equation is a generalization of the solution of the Liouville equation in the sense that, under suitable conditions, it can be expressed in terms of the solution of the Liouville equation. On the other hand, we obtain a representation of the solution of the non-Markovian stochastic Liouville equation in terms of a random walk. This representation allows for an evaluation of the solution of the non-Markovian stochastic Liouville equation in terms of the solution of the Markovian random walk equation. Finally, we discuss some examples and we comment on the limits of the method."}
{"text":"\nWe introduce a geometric framework for control theory. The key idea is to regard the evolution of a dynamical system as the flow of a geometric object, a so-called action functional, along the dynamics. This approach provides a unified framework for such diverse areas of control theory as feedback, hybrid systems, and control of partial differential equations. In the first part of the paper, we develop the mathematical foundations of this approach. We show that the evolution of an action functional along a system of differential equations is governed by a second order differential equation, the so-called geometric differential equation. We study some basic properties of this equation. In the second part of the paper, we apply our geometric framework to feedback control theory. We show how to characterize feedback stabilizing controllers in terms of the solutions of the geometric differential equation. Our results generalize classical feedback theory in several ways. In particular, we show that a controller which is stabilizing for a family of related dynamical systems need not be stabilizing for any individual system in the family."}
{"text":"\nWe show that the construction of a regular homogeneous T-model with a dark fluid in the vacuum gives rise to a solution of Einstein's field equations with a cosmological constant, which is an exact solution with a constant ratio of the circumference of a circle to its radius, that is, a solution with a homogeneous and isotropic space-time. In this model the energy density of the dark fluid is equal to the cosmological constant. We show that the resulting space-time can be described by the regular homogeneous T-model with a dark fluid in the vacuum, that is, by the sum of the relativistic potion and the rest of the space-time. As a result, the cosmological constant appears as a dynamic variable, that is, as a function of the scale factor. The model has a local Lorentzian group, and therefore it is interpretable. The model can describe a space-time with a slowly varying cosmological constant, that is, with a slowly varying energy density of the dark fluid. The slowly varying energy density can be interpreted as a slowly varying cosmological constant or, in the framework of the standard model, as a slowly varying value of the effective action."}
{"text":"\nWe present observations of X-ray emission from the young (3-4 kyr) binary system PSR J1809-1917 and its pulsar wind nebula (PNN), possibly associated with the TeV gamma-ray source HESS J1809-193. We observed the system in outburst with the Chandra X-ray Observatory and detected an X-ray source, named NX1, in the field. We found that the properties of NX1 are consistent with those expected from the wind of the young donor star, a B8III giant, flowing onto the shell of the PNN. We estimate the mass-loss rate of the donor star to be  \u223c 5 kg s^( \u2212 1). TheNX1 X-ray source is likely to be a constant-volume object, with a total X-ray luminosity of  \u223c 5 k article C, and an energy distribution described by a power law with a photon index of 1.5 \u00b1 0.2. We find that the size of the X-ray emitting region is  \u223c 120 pc cm^( \u2212 2). The measured temperature of NX1 is  \u223c 1 kK. We discuss the observations in the context of a simple model in which the PNN is an axisymmetric, time-averaged, hydrodynamically stable object, and find that such an object can be in dynamic equilibrium with the observed mass-loss rate only if the efficiency of the mass-accretion process is  \u223c 10 \u2212 4. We find that the simplest model that is consistent with the observations is one in which the accretion process is dominated by gravitational instability. We discuss the implication of our results for the structure and evolution of the PNN, and for the nature of the mass-accretion process in collapses winds."}
{"text":"\nWe present late-time optical and near-infrared observations of SN 2001el, a nearby type Ia supernova (SN) which erupted in a thin molecular cloud. We find that the SN has averted a possible SN II phase by a large-scale eruption at late-time stages, probably around T + 150 d. Our data show that the optical light curve evolution is well described by a single power law with a distinct break at a late time of T + 96 d. The near-infrared light curve is instead described by two power laws with a break at T + 50 d. We interpret the early break in the optical light curve as due to the ejection of the SN envelope, while the later break in both light curves is due to the SN-driven interaction with the molecular cloud. The total integrated radiated energy from SN 2001el is 5.4 kJ, and the final mass of the supernova is 0.21 M_sun. We find that a simple model in which the SN-cloud interaction is due to radiative cooling of the SN envelope can quantitatively describe our observations. We discuss the SN-cloud interaction in the framework of the observationally-based models of 2000cx and 2001da. We show that our observations can be explained within the framework of these models without the need of an additional SN-cloud interaction, provided that the clouds are not too massive and that they are located at large distances from the SN."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present the results of a study of the disk and adjacent objects in the nearby QSO host I Zw 1. We find that the disk has an orbital velocity of 46 km s$^{-1}$, is inclined at $30^{\\circ}$ to the plane of the sky, and has a radius of $3.4$ kpc. A comparison of the observed distribution of velocity, radius, and height with predictions of hydrodynamical models of disk formation shows that a model in which the disk forms by accretion from the surrounding medium gives the best agreement with observations. We conclude that the disk in I Zw 1 is a protoplanetary disk, and that it is still in the process of formation. The accretion of gas and dust from the surrounding medium has been rapid enough that the disk has not yet become isothermal. The gas density in the disk is a small fraction $\\sim10^{-4}$ of the mean density $\\sim10^{-2}$ cm$^{-3}$ in the ambient medium. The small fraction of gas in the disk relative to the ambient medium is a likely explanation for the slow cooling of the disk observed in I Zw 1. We estimate that the gas in the disk has a total mass $M_{\\mathrm{gas}}\\sim3\\times10^{32}$ kg, a mass fraction $f_{\\mathrm{gas}}\\sim0.005$, and a temperature $T\\sim10$ K. We find that the disk is probably not thick enough to form a collapsed core. The mass fraction $f_{\\mathrm{gas}}$ is much smaller than the $f_{\\mathrm{gas}}\\sim0.5$ that is predicted to be necessary to form a collapsed core. The disk in I Zw 1 is therefore not a collapsed core and is not likely to form a massive planet. We discuss several other possible sources of the radio emission from I Zw 1. We find that a model in which the radio emission comes from a disk with several massive planets orbiting inside a massive rim is the best agreement with observations."}
{"text":"\nWe have developed a large acceptance scintillator detector with wavelength shifting fibre read-out for the search of eta-nucleus bound states. The motivation for the research was the lack of a large-scale detector which is capable of simultaneously detecting and identifying all relevant products of eta-nucleus collisions, in particular the elusive eta-nucleus bound states. The key idea was to use a large area scintillator detector with wavelength shifting fibres for the detection of hadrons and a separate detector for the detection of the light from the scintillator. The hadrons are identified by their impact position in the scintillator, while the light from the scintillator is detected by a separate multi-channel photomultiplier tube. We have performed a detailed study of the detector response to hadrons and we have determined the optimalhadron detection efficiency as a function of the hadron impact position in the scintillator. The results obtained are in good agreement with theoretical predictions. We have also performed a preliminary study of the detector response to light from the scintillator. We have found that the light detection efficiency is relatively insensitive to the position of the light spot in the multi-channel photomultiplier tube."}
{"text":"\n\nGeneralised Einstein condition and cone construction for parabolic geometries\n\nWe consider the problem of constructing a geometrically-induced self-similar solution for the Einstein equations in vacuum, which is applicable to a wide class of self-similar solutions for the Einstein equations, including self-similar solutions with a structure of concentric spherical shells, the so-called Einstein eggs. We show that such a construction can be obtained by introducing a certain non-self-collapsing solution for the Einstein equations, which we call the generalised Einstein condition. The main tool in the construction is the cone construction, which we develop in some detail. The construction of a geometrically-induced self-similar solution for the Einstein equations in a vacuum has some practical applications in the theory of geometrically-induced energy fluctuations in a vacuum, in the theory of elementary particles and in the theory of black holes. It also has some fundamental implications for the theory of the Einstein equations and the theory of self-similar solutions."}
{"text":"\n\nElectro-optically tunable microring resonators in lithium niobate\nA high-Q optical resonator can be formed by confining light in a microring structure, which can be implemented in a semiconductor microcavity or in a crystalline resonator. One advantage of the crystalline resonator is that it can provide strong light confinement in a tiny core while achieving a high quality factor, and therefore it can be integrated with various other photonic devices. In this article, we demonstrate a tunable microring resonator in lithium niobate (LN), a ferroelectric crystal, which can be used for optical switching and cavity quantum electro-optics. The resonator has a high-Q factor of 10000 in the absence of a perturbation, and the free-spectral range is 4.3 nm. By utilizing the electro-optic effect in LN, the resonator can be tuned by an electrical signal, and the tuning range can be as large as 70 nm. Our results show that the resonator can be applied to optical switching and that it has potential for use in cavity quantum electro-optics."}
{"text":"\nWe show that nonlinear generalized functions (NGF) can be used to provide a rigorous theoretical foundation for Quantum Field Theory (QFT) that is free from the limitations of conventional Taylor-series expansions. The conventional expansions are shown to be equivalent to a particular basis set of NGF. The resulting theory is manifestly Lorentz invariant,  symmetric under the exchange of the poisson- sabotages, and yet has a very simple structure that is consistent with the principles of Quantum Theory. In particular, we show that the NGF approach naturally avoids the use of the moment-generating-functionals (MGF) that have been at the basis of much of the controversy and confusion that has surrounded the foundations of QFT. MGF have an interpretation as being related to the inner product of Hilbert space operators, but the NGF approach is strictly manifestly positivist and does not rely on any such interpretation. We show that the NGF basis set is complete, in the sense that any function can be expressed as a linear combination of the basis elements, and yet has a very simple structure that is consistent with the principles of Quantum Theory. The approach is related to the more general approach of Lagrangian Field Theory, but the NGF basis set is shown to be uniquely suited to the requirements of QFT. We also show that the NGF approach can be used to provide a rigorous foundation for the Generalized Lagrangian formalism that has been proposed as a possible alternative to the conventional Lagrangian formalism of QFT. The resulting theory is manifestly Lorentz invariant,  symmetric under the exchange of the poisson-sabotages, and yet has a very simple structure that is consistent with the principles of Quantum Theory."}

{"text":"\nPhotons with energy greater than the ionization threshold of hydrogen can drive chemical reactions by breaking chemical bonds. This effect can be used to synthesize complex molecules from simple ones, provided that the energy is absorbed by the reactants. We have carried out a systematic study of the efficiency of photon-induced nucleosynthesis in the interstellar medium. The main results are: 1) the overall efficiency of the process is very low and the main products are usually not the ones aimed for, 2) the problem is that the effective pathlength of the reacting molecules is small, on the order of the distance between two adjacent atoms, 3) for this reason, the process is very sensitive to the exact mechanism by which the photons are absorbed. We have analyzed several possible mechanisms, and the best one found so far is the direct absorption of a photon by a single bond, with the subsequent detachment of the molecule. We have studied the dependence of the efficiency on the angle between the incident photon and the bond axis, and found that it is highest when the photon is perpendicular to the bond axis. We have also found that a small number of atoms, namely two or three, are much more efficient at absorbing photons than a large number of atoms, which means that the process is rather inefficient for large molecules. The main experimental approaches to studying this process are molecular beam experiments and photoelectron spectroscopy."}
{"text":"\nExploded Fibrations is a series of relief prints that visualize the creative process of iteration. In this case, the algorithm is the artist's hand, and the data is the image. Each print contains the hand-drawn trace of a previous print; the resulting forms explode and furl as the algorithm attempts to locate and interpolate between points of data.\n\nIn this work, the authors investigate the role of the artist in an age of machine learning and artificial intelligence. As the creative process is increasingly automated, the role of the artist shifts from creator to tuner. Rather than compete with machines, the artist must learn to collaborate with them. The goal of this work is to create a language for artists to discuss and shape the collaboration with machines.\n\nTo generate the prints, the authors first created a set of input images by drawing traces on a touch screen. The touch screen recorded the artist's input as a set of points in two-dimensional space. The authors then wrote a simple algorithm to explode each point into a vector field, which was then fed into a commercial 3D printer. The 3D printer rendered the vector field as a three-dimensional form. Finally, the authors scanned the 3D forms back into two-dimensional space to create the final prints.\n\nThe authors found that the resulting prints were both familiar and unexpected. The iterative process created forms that were unique to each print, yet clearly related to each other. The results revealed new possibilities for the creative process in the age of machine learning and artificial intelligence.

{"text":"\nWe present a systematic and general approach to the problem of modeling heterogeneous materials made of differentially scattering particles. We focus on the two-point correlation function, which we use as a signature of the underlying probability distribution. We show that such a signature is rich in information about the material and that it can be used to distinguish between different materials, as well as to infer the value of the correlation length and the nature of the correlation function in the limit of large volume fraction. We also show that the two-point correlation function can be used to derive the parameters of the energy-related quantities of the system, such as the system's bulk modulus and the potential function. In particular, we show that a careful analysis of the two-point correlation function can lead to a clear identification of the underlying model and the values of its parameters. We also discuss the limitations of this approach and we point out situations in which the two-point correlation function is not sufficient for a complete characterization of the material."}

The stellar mass function is fit to the observed data, and the resulting $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ parameters are used to infer the assembly history. We show that the stellar mass function in our local volume has been assembled by a relatively smoothly varying $\\alpha$ over the last $10$ Gyr.

This conflicts with the results of numerical simulations which suggest that a major build-up should occur in this redshift range. We discuss several possible explanations for this discrepancy."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a study of the evolution of the accretion disk of V2051 Oph through two outburst cycles, using a combination of observations in the optical and near-infrared domains. We find that the accretion disk remains axisymmetric during the outbursts, with no sign of tipping, even when the accretion rate peaks at very high values. We show that this is consistent with a constant accretion rate throughout the disk. The radial dependence of the accretion rate is consistent with a power law profile with a decay index of -0.6 \u00b1 0.1, as previously found in outbursts of the donor star. We find that the accretion disk becomes more transparent during the outburst, in particular in its inner region, in agreement with a cooling and drying-up process. The outer disk, however, appears to be slightly less transparent at the end of the outburst than at the beginning, hinting at a possible clumping of dust. Our data also suggest that the accretion disk is not completely destroyed after an outburst, but that a significant fraction of it remains, requiring several outbursts to be fully disrupted. We discuss the implications of our results for the disk evolution in the context of the doughnut-model scenario."}

{"text":"\nWe consider the structure of vortical and wave modes in 3D rotating stratified flows in the presence of large scale random forcing. Such flows occur in many geophysical and astrophysical environments, as well as in laboratory experiments. We focus on the case of a flow in which the vortex velocity is small compared to the large scale forcing velocity, and the background flow is steady. We consider both ideal and viscous flows. We derive a simplified equation for the mean velocity field in the bulk of the flow, which in the case of an ideal flow is shown to have a simple structure, that depends only on the large scale velocity and the rotation rate. We use this equation to study the structure of the vortical and wave modes, in particular their instability to small scale forcing. We find that the largest vortices are most unstable, and that the stability is directly related to the geometric structure of the velocity field. We also find that the waves are stable against very large forcing, if their wavelength is large compared to the forcing scale. We then study the structure of the flow in a more realistic, viscous case. We derive a formula for the evolution of the variance of the vortical and wave modes. We show that in this case the evolution is much more complicated, and that the simple formula derived for the ideal flow does not apply. We discuss the implications of this finding for the structure of vortical and wave flows in general."}
{"text":"\nWe propose a new model for the generation of dynamos and anti-dynamos in Riemannian spaces. Our model consists of a thin magnetic flux rope that is constrained by the Riemannian structure of the space and is influenced by an applied electric field. We find that the dynamics of the system are analogous to the dynamics of a particle moving on a highway with a periodically imposed speed limit. This model can explain the generation of both dynamos and anti-dynamos in Riemannian spaces. In particular, we show that the topological structure of the flux rope is closely related to the topology of the space in which it is moving. We also show that the local behavior of the flux rope at a given point is determined by the local structure of the space, and that the violation of the rule that the magnetic flux must be conserved is related to the fact that the structure of the flux rope is not consistent with the structure of the space. Finally, we show that the spatial structure of the flux rope is related to the symmetry of the space. Our model provides a unified framework for the generation of dynamos and anti-dynamos in Riemannian spaces."}

The difference is large enough to change the chemical makeup of the atmosphere. We found that the difference in the water vapor concentrations is more significant than the difference between the concentration of carbon dioxide in younger and older planets. We also found that the difference in the optical depth of water vapor between older and younger planets is smaller than the difference in the optical depth of carbon dioxide. We attribute this to the difference in the molecular weight of the two gases. This has important implications for the photochemistry and thermal structure of the atmospheres of these planets."}

The proposed method simultaneously clusters the pixels of a hyperspectral image into a number of clusters and learns a hierarchical Markov model that represents the spatial and spectral relationships of the pixels in each cluster. The hierarchical Markov model is used to classify each pixel of the hyperspectral image into one of the previously defined clusters. The proposed method has two main steps. In the first step, the pixels of the hyperspectral image are divided into several groups based on their spectral similarities. In the second step, a hierarchical Markov model is learned for each of the groups, based on the spatial and spectral relationships between the pixels in the group. The proposed method was evaluated on a hyperspectral image of a coastal scene and the results are compared to those obtained using the k-means algorithm for pixel classification. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves better segmentation performance compared to k-means, in terms of the F-score and the overall classification error."}

{"text":"\n\nWe propose and analyze a nonperiodic anyon model which can give rise to a fractional quantum Hall effect with a non-Abelian statistics. Our anyon model is shown to be related to the statistical mechanics of a certain model of statistical equilibrium in the presence of a strong repulsion. The fraction of particles in the anyon model which are allowed to be excited is found to be directly related to the magnitude of the first quantum of the Helmholtz operator. We show that the anyon model can be thought of as a weakly disordered version of the two-row model, and in this sense our model is related to the famousCollabormann-Hicks model. The anyon model can be put on a firm theoretical basis by using the methods of nonrelativistic quantum field theory. Our anyon model can be used to investigate the differences between the weak and strong roles of the disordered terms in the anyon model and in the Collabormann-Hicks model. We show that the Collabormann-Hicks model can be understood as a particular case of our anyon model, and we give a general criterion for the occurrence of a fractional quantum Hall effect in anyon models."}
{"text":"\n\nWe propose a new recursive algorithm for calculating the effective resistance of distance-regular networks based on the Bose-Mesner algebra and the Christoffel-Darboux identity. The proposed algorithm is simple and can be easily implemented. The proposed algorithm is exact and does not introduce any additional error into the effective resistance calculation. The proposed algorithm can be used to calculate the effective resistance of distance-regular networks with a large number of nodes and links. The proposed algorithm is based on the idea of iteratively calculating the effective resistance of the network by summing up the effective resistances of the smaller sub-networks. The calculation of the effective resistance of a network can be divided into two steps: (1) calculation of the effective resistances of the sub-networks and (2) calculation of the effective resistance of the whole network by adding up the effective resistances of the sub-networks. We propose a recursive algorithm for calculating the effective resistance of the sub-networks. The proposed algorithm is based on the Bose-Mesner algebra and the Christoffel-Darboux identity. The Bose-Mesner algebra is a useful tool for calculating the effective resistance of distance-regular networks.

{"text":"\n\nWe study various aspects of quantization of soliton systems and their relation to the Langlands duality. We show that quantization of (INVmetric) Chern-Weil classes of a relative Lagrangian submanifold results in a new quantization of the entire Lagrangian manifold.

As another application, we give a description of the deformations of the geometric quantizations of the space of a discrete symplectic group and of the symplectic group itself. We also give a description of the deformations of the representation theory of the symplectic group and of the space of the discrete symplectic group. As an application of this description, we show that the geometric quantization of the space of a discrete symplectic group gives a geometric quantization of the symplectic group which is tensored with a finite-dimensional representation of the discrete symplectic group.

As an application, we show that the geometric quantization of a relative Lagrangian submanifold does not depend on the choice of the base space."}
{"text":"\n\nLayered associative network of spiking neurons is a simple model of cortical tissue, where groups of neurons in one layer are connected to groups of neurons in the next layer. We show that this model can be used to effectively solve the sparse and dense encoding problems. The motivation for this work is the understanding of how cortical tissue processes information to solve these two important tasks, and the insight that a simple model may be able to emulate the behavior of cortical tissue. We show that a layered associative network of spiking neurons can sparse and dense encode input patterns when the network is trained with a set of input patterns that are generated by adding Gaussian white noise to the desired sparse or dense encoded patterns. We show that a small number of parameters can control the strength of the sparse or dense encoding and the width of the encoded patterns. Since the parameters are coupled, they can be efficiently adjusted during a single training session. We also show that the weights of the connections in the network can be efficiently adjusted using an error back-propagation algorithm. Our model also shows some interesting properties of how the network dynamics changes with the number of layers. The theoretical analysis of the proposed model and the practical results obtained with the simulations show that this model is very flexible in learning to sparse and dense encode input patterns."}
{"text":"\nWe have developed a theory of the structure and evolution of galactic haloes based on the idea that they are bulk effects of the matter distribution in the Galactic brane. In this picture, the haloes are seen as spatial modulations of the matter density, with a strength that depends on the total matter content of the Galaxy, and with a scale that depends on the bulk flow speed. We show that this theory naturally explains several properties of the observed haloes, such as their growth with galaxy's matter content, their peaked structure, and the large scatter in the observed sizes. We also show that the theory predicts a correlation between the bulk flow speed and the halo scale, which is in agreement with the observations. Our results suggest that the evolution of the haloes is driven by the bulk flow, and that the local matter distribution only has a minor effect.\n\nWe have constructed a cosmological model that naturally explains the observed correlation between the bulk flow speed and the halo scale.

{"text":"\n\nWe investigated the spatial characteristics of joint application networks in Japanese patents. Our motivation was to understand the characteristics of innovation in different regions in Japan. Our data consists of all the patents granted to Japanese inventors in the period 2005-2014. We define a joint application network as a set of patents in which one or more of the inventors are common to two or more patents. We find three types of communities, namely, large-scale, medium-scale, and small-scale communities, in the joint application network. To understand the characteristics of these communities, we performed a social network analysis. As a result, we found that small-scale communities tend to be localized in a small number of regions, whereas large-scale communities are more widely distributed over the whole country. We also found that the average number of inventors in small-scale communities is much larger than that in large-scale communities. Our results suggest that large-scale communities are formed through the collaboration between large companies and that small-scale communities are formed through the collaboration between small companies and the universities."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a detailed study of the CoRoT primary target HD 52265 based on a new observational campaign using the 1.5 m telescope of the Calar Alto Observatory. We have derived the parameters of aAskapStars5 model of this star by fitting the photometric and radial velocity data available in the literature. We have compared this model with other models found in the literature and with the observations obtained with the 1.5 m telescope of the Calar Alto Observatory. The comparison of the observations with the predictions of the different models has allowed us to test the models and to choose the best one. The star HD 52265 has been observed in a photometric campaign with the 1.5 m telescope using two different instruments, i.e. ISIS and FEROS, in two different photometric bands, i.e. the visual and the near-infrared, in order to get a more complete description of the star's atmosphere. We have derived the parameters of the star in both bands and compared them with the predictions of the models. We have found that the visible photometry is well described by the model AskapStars5, while in the near-infrared the star is a little bit cooler and a little bit bigger than in the visible. This finding supports the hypothesis that the star has a deceptive photosphere, with a shallow temperature gradient."}
{"text":"\nWe report the results of a systematic study of the superconducting properties of normal metal\/superconductor (NM\/SC) junctions. We find a strong frequency dependence of the pairing strength in such junctions, with a peak at a frequency intermediate between the two constituent materials. We show that this odd-frequency pairing can be understood in terms of a macroscopic Helmholtz model, in which the superconducting order parameter is treated as a local field which mediates a weak pairing interaction between the normal and superconducting regions. We also show that this model can be used to describe the pairing behavior in junctions of different geometries, and in systems in which the normal region is itself a superconductor. The theory also makes quantitative predictions which can be tested by a suitable choice of materials and geometry. We propose that the odd-frequency pairing phenomenon we observe is a general feature of systems in which the SC order parameter can penetrate the normal region."}
{"text":"\nWe present a detailed analysis of the velocity structure of moving magnetic features (MMFs) around sunspots, based on high-resolution observations of the solar photosphere in the extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) and ultraviolet (UV) wavebands. We find that the majority of MMFs are associated with sunspot pairs, with each member of a pair moving in a different direction. We show that the distribution of MMF velocities is consistent with the U-loop model for the formation of sunspot pairs, in which the motion of the magnetic dipole structure (or \"U-loop\") is the dominant driver of the movement of MMFs. We also find that MMFs around sunspot pairs are on average faster and more elongated than MMFs around single sunspots, consistent with the U-loop model. In addition, we find that the relative velocity between MMFs in a sunspot pair increases with increasing separation, which is also consistent with the U-loop model. Our results provide strong support for the U-loop model of sunspot pair formation and have important implications for our understanding of the dynamics of magnetic fields on the solar surface."}
{"text":"\nWe propose a new theory of longitudinal atom string vibrations and Berry phases in atoms. It is shown that the standard description of the longitudinal atom string vibration in terms of the circulation of a complex linear combination of atomic orbitals (evich-paramagnetic resonance) is valid only in the limit of an infinitely large atomic number. A generalized theory, which takes into account the finite atomic number, is developed. The main idea of the theory is to replace the complex linear combination of atomic orbitals with the combination of certain special functions ( sabr functions ) which have the same antisymmetric properties as the complex linear combination, but do not depend on the atomic number. As a result, the general theory of longitudinal atom string vibrations and Berry phases in atoms reduces to the study of the properties of the sabr functions. The theory is applied to the description of the level schemes of various atomic systems, and the role of the Fermi motion in the generation of the chiral structure of atomic spectra is emphasized."}
{"text":"\n\nMidlatitude Cirrus Clouds and Multiple Tropopauses from a 2002-2006 Climatology over the SIRTA Observatory\n\nWe present a climatology of cirrus clouds and multiple tropopauses observed over the SIRTA Observatory in France, based on four years of lidar observations (2002-2006). Cirrus clouds are found to occupy a large part of the atmosphere above the observatory, with a significant vertical structure. The lidar ratio, defined as the backscattered signal per unit of aerosol optical depth, exhibits a maximum at around 7 km and another one at around 9 km, indicative of the presence of two cloud decks. These cloud decks are also found to have different optical depths, as diagnosed from the fit of a two-layer cloud model to the observations. The high optical depth of the upper cloud deck implies that this cirrus layer has a strong radiative effect on the atmosphere. We show that the temperature of the cirrus clouds increases with height, in qualitative agreement with a positive cloud-top-warming effect. The temperature of the lower cloud deck is instead relatively constant with height, suggesting that it is well mixed. We attribute this to the strong wind shear in the atmosphere. We found that the multiple tropopauses are present in more than 90% of the year, and they are responsible for the large amount of cirrus clouds. Our results suggest that these cirrus clouds are rather long-lived, since they are present in the afternoon as well as in the evening. The multiple tropopauses are also found to be highly correlated with the large-scale dynamics, such as the North Atlantic Oscillation and the Siberian High. We conclude that the multiple tropopauses are a prominent feature of the midlatitude atmosphere, and they have important implications on the transport and the radiative properties of the atmosphere."}
{"text":"\nWe study the effects of small-mass-ratio on the evolution of coalescing black-hole binaries, by means of numerical-relativity simulations, and in the limit of strong gravitational interactions between the black holes and the host galaxies. For these galaxies we consider both spherically symmetric and axi-symmetric potential fields. We find that the merger process is generally faster for black-hole binaries with small mass ratios, and that this speed-up is more pronounced for binaries evolving in axi-symmetric galaxies. In the case of spherically symmetric galaxies, the typical lifetime of a small-mass-ratio binary is longer than that of a large-mass-ratio binary, but the evolution is more complex, with more frequent exchange of energy with the host galaxy, and hence more opportunities for the transfer of mass from the binary to the galaxy. We also find that in all cases the energy and angular momentum of the system are preserved, with the possible exception of the initial stages of the evolution, where the system may receive or lose large amounts of energy."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present the Millennium Galaxy Catalogue, a catalogue of galaxy pairs with projected separations of <= 50 Mpc, drawn from the Millennium Survey. We find a strong correlation between the total observed galaxy number in a pair and the asymmetry of the pair, with an excess of galaxies in the trailing half of the pair. We show this correlation to be consistent with a model in which the merger rate of a pair is proportional to the product of the number of galaxies in the pair and the asymmetry of the pair, where the asymmetry is a measure of the probability that a galaxy in the leading half of the pair is closer to the nearest galaxy in the pair than a galaxy in the trailing half. We determine the merger rate of the Millennium Galaxy Catalogue using this model, and show that it is consistent with the rate estimated from the Hamiltonian of a simple model of the formation and evolution of galaxy pairs. We find that the estimated merger rate is higher than previously estimated, but still consistent with a merge rate of <= 10 perrably per Gpc3 per year."}
{"text":"\n\nWe propose a classical approach to the graph isomorphism problem using quantum walks. Our method is based on the fact that a quantum walk on a graph visits each vertex as many times as the number of walks on the line graph. We show that a sequence of quantum walks which has the same initial state and which is not much correlated (i.e., the walkers are almost independent) visits each vertex an almost uniform number of times. In particular, if the graph is a symmetric graph, the number of visits to each vertex is proportional to the number of edges incident to it. We show that this proportionality can be used to solve the graph isomorphism problem by a series of deductions which do not require any knowledge of the graph isomorphism type of the vertices. As a byproduct, we show that the classical conditional independence graph property is equivalent to the quantum independence property in the sense that the graph isomorphism type of the components of a graph is independent of the graph isomorphism type of the other components."}
{"text":"\nWe study the signatures of heavy Z-prime in the extra U(1) superstring inspired model (EUM) and find that they are consistent with the heavy Z-prime scenario in the framework of the EUM. This conclusion is drawn from a careful analysis of the RGEs (root generating functions) associated with the EUM. This analysis shows that the EUM can produce a universal RGE that is consistent with the heavy Z-prime scenario and its spawned chiral superfields. This RGE is in the form of an infinite dimensional cup product that shows a strong non-trivial correlation function in its leading term. The construction and the analysis of the RGEs associated with the EUM is a non-trivial task, which is different from the analysis of the RGEs in the framework of the minimal U(1) extension of the EUM. As an application, we give a simple description of the RGEs associated with the EUM in the case when the EUM has a minimal U(1) extension. This description allows one to understand the RGEs of the EUM in the minimal U(1) extension in the sense that the RGEs of the EUM in its minimal U(1) extension are \" eld theoretic generalizations \" of the RGEs associated with the EUM itself."}

{"text":"\n\nWe present a soft X-ray study of Type I active galactic nuclei (AGN) observed with the High Energy Transmission Grating Spectrometer (HETGS) on board the Chandra X-ray Observatory. Our aim is to test the hypothesis that the X-ray emission from the accretion disk in Type I AGN is dominated by the inner accretion flow, where the accretion rate is higher due to the effects of the strong gravitational field of the central supermassive black hole (SMBH). We find that the accretion disk continuum in Type I AGN is best described by a two-component model. The inner accretion flow, responsible for the emission from the innermost region of the accretion disk (r < 2 R_{SMBH}), is significantly harder (kT \u223c 1.7 keV) than the rest of the disk (kT \u223c 0.6 keV). We estimate that the inner accretion flow extends to a radius of \u223c 3\u20134 R_{SMBH} (\u223c 30\u201340 kpc for a SMBH mass of 109 M\u2299) and contains 8\u201311% of the total accretion disk emission. We also find that the accretion disk is responsible for the X-ray emission from the broad regions (r \u223c 2\u20135 R_{SMBH}) where the intensity is highest. The low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) that we use as a comparison have a harder continuum (kT \u223c 1.9 keV) than the inner accretion flow in Type I AGN, and they contain a harder (kT \u223c 2.5 keV) inner accretion flow than the rest of the disk. We discuss our results in the framework of the disk-ignition model, and we suggest that the lower accretion-rate and the larger accretion disk in Type I AGN produce a more gradual ignition process of the accretion disk compared to the LMXBs."}

{"text":"\nWe consider the equilibrium structure of spherical collapse experiments in which a large number of hard-walled, equally-sized, rigid spheres are piled together in a random fashion. We show that such systems have a characteristic length scale that is a function of the volume fraction of the spheres and the friction coefficient between the spheres. We analyze the equilibrium configurations of the systems in terms of the scaling of the height and the tortuosity of the resulting structures. We find that the structures always have a negative tortuosity, the magnitude of which depends on the system parameters. We analyze the energy of the system as a function of the system parameters, and show that the energy is minimized when the system is in a state of optimal disorder. We also show that the system has several different regimes of stable equilibrium configurations, each of which is characterized by a different value of the characteristic length scale. We analyze the different regimes in terms of the statistics of the system over long time periods.

{"text":"\nWe present a new systematics in charmless strange $B^+ \\to VP$ decays, based on the idea that the $B^+$ meson is a quantum mechanically-delocalized particle.

{"text":"\n\nWe reexamine the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen experiment, photon correlation, and Bell's inequality. We find that while the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen argument against hidden variables can be rescued by considering time-varying coefficients in the acquainted and unacquainted photonic polarization, this result depends on the time-integrated mean of the coefficients. When the time-variation of the coefficients is considered, the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen experiment does not constrain the hidden variables theory. We consider a generalized Bell's inequality which is invariant under time-variation of the coefficients and find that it can be satisfied by a hidden variables theory in which the parameters of the hidden variables are allowed to be time-dependent. We also examine a correlation function which is invariant under time-variation of the coefficients and find that this correlation function can be used to define a new form of quantum entanglement which does not depend on the time-integration over the coefficients. This form of entanglement can be shown to be equivalent to the one originally defined by Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen. We show that the assumptions of the hidden variables theory can be formally stated in such a way as to guarantee that the theory will satisfy Bell's inequality. We also show that any violation of Bell's inequality can be interpreted as due to a nonlocality in the assignment of the quantum states to the elementary events, and not to a nonlocality in the physical law.

{"text":"\n\nWe present new X-ray and radio observations of the accretion disc around R Aquarii. These data, obtained over the period 1999.8 to 2004.0, are the most complete monitoring of the X-ray and radio emission from this source to date, and they are the first such data to be acquired since the mid-1990s. We find that the X-ray and radio luminosities have increased by factors of 1.4 and 1.6 respectively since the last monitoring campaign. We show that the accretion disc is now radiating at the same X-ray and radio luminosity as it was in 1995, after a period of quiescence in which the luminosity had been reduced by factors of 3 and 5 respectively. The radial and vertical structures in the X-ray and radio emission are consistent with the disc being oriented close to face-on to us, as it was in 1995. We estimate that the inner disc has a temperature of about 0.75 keV, and that the outer disc has a temperature of about 1.25 keV. These temperatures are only slightly higher than in 1995.

{"text":"\n\nThe purpose of this investigation was to determine if a gravimetrical method could be designed to revive the corpuscular theory of light. The idea for this method was inspired by the double-slit experiment. The basic setup for this method consisted of a light source, a double-slit aperture, and a photoelectric detector. The intensity of the light that hit the photoelectric detector was measured and recorded. The photoelectric detector was adjusted so that the brightest spot in the double-slit pattern was at the center. Then, the gravitational field was applied to the light by placing a mass directly above the light source. The mass was allowed to fall freely and it passed between the two slits. The falling mass changed the path of the light, which in turn changed the position of the bright spot on the photoelectric detector. After the mass passed the double-slit aperture, the bright spot was back in the center of the photoelectric detector. The photoelectric detector measured the intensity of the light, which should have decreased while the mass was passing in front of the double-slit aperture. The data showed that the intensity of the light decreased while the mass was passing in front of the double-slit aperture. This result suggests that the corpuscular theory of light may be revived using a gravimetrical method."}
{"text":"\n\nWe have developed a new, more physically realistic, set of numerical simulations of the boundary layer between a white dwarf and its accretion disk. We have used the hydrodynamics code NEUTEC to solve the compressible Navier-Stokes equations with an appropriate set of boundary conditions. We compared our results with previous two-dimensional simulations, which used the code Tech-X, and found good agreement. This agreement improves when we use a model for the viscosity profile in the NEUTEC simulations that assumes a self-similar solution, suggesting that the development of the boundary layer is controlled by the local viscosity. We have studied the influence of various physical parameters, such as the viscosity and the temperature distribution in the donor star, on the shape of the boundary layer. We find that the transition region between the boundary layer and the accretion disk is sensitive to the chosen boundary conditions, in particular to the definition of the physical extent of the white dwarf. We also study the properties of the flow in the boundary layer and find that the length of the region with sub-Alf\u00e9n ionized gas is proportional to the donor star's rotational period. Our results suggest that the presence of a boundary layer with a well-defined inner edge is important for a stable accretion disk configuration."}
{"text":"\nWe present a method to constrain the abundance of highly ionized regions in the early universe by analyzing the distribution of ionized hydrogen in the Ly\u03b1 forest. Our method is based on the fact that the ionization of hydrogen increases with the growth of the universe, while the density of ionized gas decreases with the expansion of the universe and the formation of voids. Therefore, the ratio of ionized gas to the total gas should increase with the growth of the universe. We find that the observed distribution of highly ionized gas in the Ly\u03b1 forest is consistent with the model in which the abundance of highly ionized gas is constant. This conclusion is supported by a detailed comparison between the predictions of our model and the observations. We also show that the observed abundance of highly ionized gas is inconsistent with the models in which the abundance of highly ionized gas increases or decreases with the growth of the universe. The main result of our work is a set of constraints on the abundance of highly ionized gas in the early universe."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a measurement of the cosmic-ray (CR) pressure in a large volume of the local galaxy cluster Fornax, obtained with the Gamma-Ray unlucky imaging telescope (GRIT). The measurement uses the stacking of ~50,000 CR-excess images obtained with a fish-eye lens, to obtain a map of the CR pressure integrated over the cluster. We find a pressure of $6 \\times 10^{-6}$ cm-5, which is consistent with the pressure measured by the Fermi satellite in the Galactic disk, and with other cluster measurements. We show that this pressure is in agreement with the pressure expected from a simple model in which the CRs are relativistic, and the cluster acts as a perfect drag-free Yorker bottle. In this model, the pressure is given by the relativistic energy loss of the CRs, and depends only on the CR bulk velocity and the cluster radius. We show that this model predicts a pressure of $4-6 \\times 10^{-6}$ cm-5, in good agreement with our measurement, and with other cluster measurements. We discuss the implications of our measurement for CR propagation in clusters, and for the CR source. We find that the pressure is consistent with a simple model in which the CRs are produced by a large number of weakly-ionized sources, with a uniform ionization spectrum, and with a bulk velocity that varies smoothly with the cluster radius."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present here observations of the microwave continuum emission from air shower plasmas, made with the hope of being able to observe, for the first time, the frequency-dependent heating of the plasma as it expands and cools down. We have used the fact that at frequencies lower than the ion plasma frequency, the bulk motion of the plasma is responsible for the emission, while at frequencies higher than the ion plasma frequency, the emission is due to plasma oscillations. We have used two different telescopes, one with a narrow bandwidth (92 GHz) and the other with a wide bandwidth (5-42 GHz), and have observed the emission from air showers produced by cosmic rays and by radioisotope sources. We have found that, as expected, the power spectrum of the continuum emission has a cut-off frequency equal to the ion plasma frequency. We have also found, surprisingly, that the shape of the power spectrum is very well described by a power law with a photon index of 1.3-1.6, in spite of the fact that the emission is due to different physical mechanisms at different frequencies. We have observed a frequency-dependent evolution of the power spectrum, with the power law index decreasing with frequency. This is consistent with a simple model in which the index is inversely proportional to the energy per degree of freedom in the plasma. Our observations imply that the frequency-dependent evolution of the power spectrum cannot be described by a single parameterization. We discuss this in the framework of a simple model which takes into account the frequency-dependent energy distribution in the plasma. Our results suggest that this model is capable of describing the data, and also has a physical meaning."}
{"text":"\nWe have performed a systematic angle-resolved photoemission study of the non-Fermi liquid (NFL) state in a Kondo lattice, an antiferromagnetic system with a strong spin-orbit coupling and a small moment per site. The non-Fermi liquid state is induced by a perpendicular magnetic field applied along the antiferromagnetic direction. Our aim was to understand the origin of the incoherent, low-temperature scattering, which was observed in the NFL state, by investigating the role of the spin-orbit coupling and the lattice structure. We found that the spin-orbit coupling, which distorts the lattice and breaks the time-reversal symmetry, gives rise to a significant increase in the scattering amplitude. In addition, the local moment per site and the existence of a finite number of magnetic ions in the lattice play a crucial role in the emergence of the incoherent, low-temperature scattering. Our results suggest that the incoherent scattering in the non-Fermi liquid state is a generic feature of lattices with a strong spin-orbit coupling and a small moment per site, and that it is closely related to the lattice symmetry and the local moment per site."}
{"text":"\nDetecting atmospheric neutrino oscillations in the ATLAS detector at CERN\n\nWe present here the first search for atmospheric neutrino oscillations with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The motivation for this work is twofold. First, the high statistics of the LHC enable a precise measurement of the oscillation parameters. Second, the long baseline of the LHC, which extends over more than 100 km, provides a unique opportunity to observe atmospheric neutrinos at a large distance from their production, and hence to probe the full parameter space of neutrino oscillations. We describe the methodology used to search for atmospheric neutrino oscillations, and present the results of an analysis of a sample of 70 million events collected during the first two years of LHC operation, in the final state with a hadronically decaying tau lepton and at least three jets. We find no evidence for atmospheric neutrino oscillations and set a limit on the softest oscillations that can be observed with the LHC, regardless of the neutrino source. This limit is in agreement with the expectations from atmospheric neutrino production and the predicted sensitivity of the LHC. We discuss the implications of our results for future neutrino oscillation searches, both for the LHC and for other experiments."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present photometric and spectroscopic observations of a well-selected sample of 37 T8 and later-type dwarfs in an effort to assess the accuracy of the HR 8799 controversy. Our sample includes all of the T8 dwarfs with published spectral information as well as many later-type dwarfs of interest. We present new spectral information for 32 of our targets. We find that the spectral types of the T8 dwarfs are in agreement with the published spectral types. We find that the later-type dwarfs in our sample have a much larger variation in spectral type than the T8 dwarfs. We discuss this finding in the context of the controversy. We present new ages for 7 of our targets. We find that the T8 dwarfs are of similar age to the later-type dwarfs in our sample. We present new masses for 14 of our targets. We find that the masses of the T8 dwarfs are in agreement with the published masses. We find that the masses of the later-type dwarfs in our sample have a much larger variation in mass than the T8 dwarfs. We discuss this finding in the context of the controversy. We find that our sample is consistent with the T8 dwarfs being a unique group of very low-mass stars that are more massive than the very low-mass stars that make up the later-type dwarfs. We conclude that the controversy is not resolved and that the two groups of very low-mass stars are probably distinct."}
{"text":"\n\nSample eigenvalue based detection of high dimensional signals in white noise using relatively few samples\n\nThis paper presents a novel technique for the detection of high dimensional signals in white noise using relatively few samples. The motivation for the research is the problem of detecting a high dimensional signal in a low sample rate environment. The key idea is to use the sample eigenvalues of the signal correlation matrix to detect the signal. The sample eigenvalues are then used to estimate the eigenvalues of the correlation matrix. The methodology is illustrated with the detection of a simulated signal in white noise. The results obtained are compared with the results obtained using the same number of samples but with the sample eigenvalues of the noise correlation matrix. The problem the technique attempts to solve is the detection of a high dimensional signal in a low sample rate environment. The practical application of the technique is in the detection of high dimensional signals in a low sample rate environment. The theoretical application of the technique is in the area of statistical signal processing."}
{"text":"\nWe show that certain finite point sets in the plane have a special symmetry property not possessed by the vertices of a regular polygon: all the line segments connecting two of the points have the same length. We call these point sets \"hidden\" symmetric point sets because a geometric object must be carefully constructed to reveal this symmetry. For example, the points of two regular polygons (one convex, one concave) are connected by equally long line segments only if the convex polygon is placed inside the concave polygon, and the connecting line segments are the polygon's diagonals. We construct several other examples of hidden symmetric point sets, and show that a general rule for finding such point sets is to place a convex polygon on a circle and use the vertices of equally spaced sectors. We also show that the same type of hidden symmetry exists in higher dimensions, and that a general rule for constructing hidden symmetric point sets in n- dimensions is to place a convex polytope on a sphere and use the vertices of equally spaced hemispheres."}
{"text":"\n\nWe investigate the selection against demographic stochasticity in age-structured populations. We develop a new exact method of computing the selection gradient relating fitness to changes in age structure. We apply our method to an empirical model of the demographic dynamics of great apes. We find selection against stochasticity in age structure is very strong in all species and is equivalent to a selection pressure of several percent per generation. This is sufficient to maintain age structure and predicts that any demographic model with an incorrect assumption of age structure will be rejected by selection in the wild. Selection against demographic stochasticity is stronger at younger ages, indicating that younger individuals are more sensitive to the effects of stochasticity. We find that including a measure of temperature as a covariate in the selection gradient computation reduces the strength of selection against stochasticity, indicating that temperature reduces the importance of age structure. Our method can be used to investigate selection against demographic stochasticity in other populations and is generally applicable to computing selection gradients relating fitness to any covariate."}
{"text":"\nWe consider the dynamics of a quantum vacuum, consisting of a scalar field \u03c8 and a longitudinal gauge field A, in a homogeneous and isotropic gravitational field. In a first approximation, we assume that the gravitational field does not change the energy density \u03c1=\u03c8^2\/2 in the vacuum. Then the energy \u03c1 changes only due to the non-gravitational acceleration, which can be understood as a change of the volume V=\u03c8^2\/2\/A, or, equivalently, as a change of the pressure p=\u03c1\/V. In this approximation, we show that the energy falls like \u03c8\/R, where R is the distance to the attracting body, and the speed of energy descent is proportional to \u03c8\/R. This acceleration is independent of the mass M of the attracting body, and it does not change if a quantum vacuum is replaced by a classical vacuum. We also derive a simple formula for the energy of a particle in a quantum vacuum in the presence of a gravitational field. Our result is consistent with the principles of quantum mechanics and general relativity, but it cannot be described by the frameworks of both theories separately. We discuss the physical and philosophical implications of our result."}
{"text":"\n\nWe propose and analyze a new concept of a supercoupling transmission line that is based on a periodic or quasi-periodic distribution of epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) metamaterials along the line. We show that such a line can have a super-high-Q resonance at a frequency \u03c9 that is much lower than the band gap of the ENZ metamaterials and can confine the electromagnetic field in a very narrow channel, in spite of the fact that the transition to the channel is very gentle and has a large radius. The concept can be used to design broadband antennas, to realize the guiding of electromagnetic waves in very narrow channels and to generate high intensities in small volumes. It can also be used to design a new kind of photonic crystal that can have a complete band gap with a very large bandwidth and a very small thickness of the dielectric, in spite of the fact that the dielectric is not a single crystal but a quasi-periodic structure. We also analyze the concept of a squeezing wave resonator that can have a high-Q resonance at a frequency that is much lower than the resonance frequency of the individual ENZ units. The concept can be used to design a new kind of filter. It can also be used as a way to achieve effective field confinement in a very large bandwidth, in spite of the fact that the transition to the channel is very gentle and has a large radius."}
{"text":"\n\nBrain Prostheses as a Dynamic System (Immortalizing the Human Brain?)\n\nWe consider a class of neuroprostheses, which we term dynamic, that can interact with the brain and are capable of improvement through learning. We propose a generic dynamic neuroprosthesis architecture and discuss three different ways in which a neuroprosthesis can learn: by observing and copying the behavior of a subject (copy-learn), by observing and extracting the underlying rules of the subject (rule-learn), and by actively interacting with the subject (interactive-learn). We also discuss a simple model of a dynamic neuroprosthesis, which we use to illustrate these different ways of learning. We then discuss the use of such a neuroprosthesis for the rehabilitation of stroke patients, and we analyze the associated challenges. In particular, we point out that learning requires a precise knowledge of the timing of neural activity, which is difficult to obtain with current invasive technologies. We finally discuss the possibility of building a large-scale dynamic brain prosthesis, which could interact with the healthy brain and learn new tasks as needed. This would result in a versatile tool that could be used for many different purposes, from enhancing the abilities of healthy individuals to providing rehabilitation for patients with brain damage."}
{"text":"\n\nThe Transition Zone in Balmer-Dominated Shocks\n\nWe present a comprehensive study of the structure and evolution of the transition zone in balmer-dominated shocks. We find that the transition zone in these shocks is significantly wider and more complex than the classical one-zone structure predicted by most current shock tube codes. In particular, we find that the transition zone in these shocks consists of three distinct regions: a pre-transition region, a narrow transition region, and a post-transition region. We show that these regions can be identified from a pressure-volume diagram by observing the variation of the Mach number with respect to the volume fraction of the mixture. We present a simple model that quantitatively describes the structure and evolution of the transition zone in these shocks. Our results suggest that the traditional one-zone structure is not appropriate for describing the structure and evolution of the transition zone in these shocks, and that a more complex, three-zone structure is required."}
{"text":"\nWe present a simple block locally optimal preconditioned eigenvalue (BLOPEX) method for solving large symmetric eigenvalue problems in hypre and PETSc. Our approach is motivated by the observation that the standard Generalized Minimum Residual method for eigenvalue problems can be made more robust by combining it with a simple block preconditioner that is optimal in a local sense. We show that such a preconditioner can be constructed by combining a general singular value decomposition algorithm with the diagonal of the input matrix, and that this preconditioner can then be used to define a simple but robust eigenvalue solver. In addition, we show that this eigenvalue solver can be made even more robust by using an approximate inverse of the preconditioner as the block preconditioner. We implement our BLOPEX method in hypre and PETSc, and we evaluate its performance on a wide range of eigenvalue problems. Our results show that BLOPEX can be used to solve very large eigenvalue problems, and that it is both robust and efficient."}
{"text":"\n\nWe study the fundamental problem of computing the non-abelian Yang-Mills group on the lattice. We show that this problem is in general more difficult than computing the abelian variety of the same dimension. We consider different techniques which can be used to solve this problem, including the use ofcharacters, three-term recurrence, and the translation method. In the case of the pure Yang-Mills group, we show that any solution to this problem must take the form of a polynomial in the fundamental representation of the group. This reduces the problem to an issue of determining the root system of the group, and hence to the problem of classifying three-term recurrent integrals of the fundamental representation. We present an algorithm which classifies such integrals, and show that this algorithm can be used to solve the pure Yang-Mills case. We also show that this problem is equivalent to the problem of finding an embedding of the pure Yang-Mills group into a finite-dimensional representation of its generalizations. This in turn reduces to the problem of finding an integral representation of the generalized Yang-Mills group which contains a particular sub representation. We present an algorithm which finds such an integral representation. As an application, we use our algorithm to show that certain categories of symmetrically acting finite-dimensional representations of the pure Yang-Mills group have the structure of an equivariant category."}
{"text":"\n\nWe investigate the dynamics of baryons from string theory and vector dominance. In the framework of string theory, we study the generation and dynamics of baryons from the 16 and 28 dimensional frameworks of type II and type I string theory, respectively. We find that the dynamics of baryons is closely related to the geometry of the string theory and the imposed boundary conditions. In the case of type I string theory, we show that the states with large baryon number can be obtained by an appropriate choice of the boundary conditions. In the case of type II string theory, we find that the generated baryons are in general tied to the geometry of the string theory. In particular, we find that the massless baryons are in general Page- operator super governed. We also show that the choice of the string framework and the geometry of the string theory can lead to non-standard behavior of the baryons, such as the baryon number violation and the appearance of several generations of baryons.\n\nWe also study the dynamics of baryons in the framework of vector dominance. We show that the baryons in this case are in general related to the Lorentz invariance of the theory. We find that, even if the Lorentz invariance is broken by the gravity, the baryons can be generated in the theory. We also find that the generated baryons are in general related to the Lorentz violating operators, and the behavior of the baryons can be used to test the Lorentz invariance of the theory.

{"text":"\nWe present a new clustering algorithm based on soft-constraint affinity propagation (SCAP), a general framework for computing the maximum a posteriori (MAP) configuration of a set of random variables given a set of constraints. SCAP is an iterative algorithm that proceeds by (1) evaluating the posterior probability of each possible configuration, given the constraints, (2) selecting the configuration with the highest posterior probability, and (3) updating the posterior probabilities of the remaining configurations based on the selection. We show that this general framework can be applied to the problem of gene-expression clustering, where the constraints are given by the interdependence of gene expressions and the configuration is the set of genes to be clustered. We present an implementation of this algorithm based on a proper utilization of the connection between SCAP and the Hungarian algorithm, and show that this clustering algorithm can achieve competitive performance in terms of the number of clusters, compared to other popular gene-expression clustering algorithms."}
{"text":"\n\nWe investigate the properties of functions with many local maxima or minima (so-called strong peak functions) and show that such functions have a number of interesting and nontrivial properties. We show that a necessary and sufficient condition for a function to have a strong peak point (a point at which the function has a local maximum and there are no other local maxima within a certain distance) is that the function has a certain number of derivatives equal to one at this point. We show that the number of strong peak points is upper bounded by a constant, which is independent of the domain and the mapping function. In particular, this shows that there are only a finite number of strong peak points on a closed domain. Furthermore, we show that if the number of strong peak points is large, then the function must be very flat around the strong peak points. In addition, we show that the distance between the strong peak points is also upper bounded by a constant, which is independent of the domain and the mapping function. As a consequence, we show that the number of strong peak points is a smooth function of the parameter that controls the distance between the strong peak points. We also show that the number of strong peak functions is infinite."}

{"text":"\n\nThe IC1396N proto-cluster at a scale of 250 AU\n\nWe present photometric and kinematic data for a large field of the sky containing the old, rich open cluster IC1396 and its surrounding molecular clouds. We find four distinct groups of young stars in the field, with ages estimated to be between 2 and 4 million years. The data also reveal a cluster-like structure, extended to a radius of about 250 pc, containing several of the groups of young stars. We interpret this structure as a large-scale proto-cluster, and identify the young stars as being either individual cluster members or member condensations within the protocluster. We estimate that the protocluster contains about 30% gas by mass, a fraction that is probably typical of molecular clouds that contain star-forming regions. The star-forming regions in the protocluster are relatively rich, with a number density of about 2.5 \u00d7 10\u22124 Mpc\u22123, compared to a typical molecular cloud density of order 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22123 Mpc\u22123.

{"text":"\nWe calculate the mass spectra of quarkonia in the color--flavor locked (CFL) phase of dense quark matter and of the corresponding diquarks and mesons in the normal hadron phase. The quarkonia mass spectra in the CFL phase can be obtained by using the exact replica of the hadron spectrum with the only difference that the quarkonia are produced from quark-antiquark pairs instead of quarks and antiquarks. We find that the quarkonia mass spectra in the CFL phase is very different from the hadron spectrum: in particular, the masses of quarkonia are always smaller than the masses of the corresponding hadrons even when the quarkonia are produced from the lightest quark-antiquark pairs. The smallness of the quarkonia masses can be explained by the strong quark-antiquark correlation in the CFL phase. On the other hand, the diquark and meson mass spectra in the normal hadron phase can be obtained by using thecounty basis trick with the Jordan--Wigner transformation. We find that the mass spectra of diquarks and mesons are different in the two phases: in particular, some very heavy mesons which do not exist in the hadron phase can be produced in the CFL phase. We also find that the diquark and meson mass spectra in the normal hadron phase can be obtained by using the exact replica of the quarkonia mass spectrum with the only difference that the quarkonia are produced from quark-antiquark pairs instead of quarks and antiquarks. Our results can be used to test the quarkonia production in the CFL phase and to probe the structure of quarkonia in the hadron phase."}

{"text":"\n\nCollisions between equal-sized ice grain agglomerates\nAgents of erosion, ice grain agglomerates (IGAs) are widespread in the solar system and can have macroscopic impacts on the surfaces of planets and satellites. Collisions between IGAs are expected to be an important process in the evolution of these surfaces, but the existing theories are not able to explain the nature of the impact craters observed. We present a new model of collisions between equal-sized IGAs, which can produce craters of the sizes observed, provided that the IGAs are icy, rather than icy-rocky, and that the collisions are not perfectly elastic. Our model indicates that the craters observed on Europa's surface may have formed by such collisions, whereas on the surface of Pluto's moon Charon, the energy release may have been sufficient to form geological structures on the scale of mountains. We discuss the implications of this model for the energy budgets of icy bodies, and in particular for the thickness of the icy shells of the Europa and the Earth's moon."}
{"text":"\nWe present a hydrodynamical algorithm to simulate detonations in superbursts. The algorithm is based on the solution of the 3-D Euler equations with appropriate boundary conditions at the detonation front. The detonation is described by a thermodynamically consistent constitutive relation which includes the effects of both of the main thermodynamic processes, i.e. the work done on the gas and the energy release due to the explosion. The equation of state used is a thermodynamically consistent form of the ideal gas law. We solve the 3-D Euler equations with the help of a streamtube decomposition which reduces the 3-D problem to a 1-D problem and allows to solve the gas dynamics in the streamtube with the help of a implicit, finite volume method. In the framework of this method the constitutive relation is implemented in a simple, but consistent way. We present results for one-dimensional (1-D) gas dynamics which show the influence of the different parameters on the dynamics of the detonation and the structure of the detonation front."}
{"text":"\nWe consider the generic gravitational signals that would be produced by the implosion of a rotating stellar core. We find that such signals possess many of the characteristics of the gravitational signals detected by LIGO during the past two decades. In particular, we find that (i) the dominant signal frequency is roughly proportional to the inverse of the ratio of the core radius to its mass, (ii) the frequency is largely independent of the initial orbital velocity of the core, and (iii) the detected signal amplitude depends roughly on the cube of the ratio of the core radius to its mass. These findings suggest that core implosion might produce detectable gravitational signals, and could potentially be used as a probe of core properties. We find that the signal amplitude is generally too small to be detected by LIGO for reasonable core masses. However, we show that if the core is composed of a mixture of approximately equal parts of two different elements, the signal amplitude can be increased significantly. We consider several different possible core compositions, and find that a mixture of oxygen and hydrogen, or a mixture of helium and hydrogen, would produce the largest signal amplitudes. We also consider several different physical mechanisms that could potentially drive a rotating core to collapse, and find that none of them would produce a signal with the correct frequency. We conclude that the detection of generic gravitational signals from core implosion is unlikely, unless cores are composed of a mixture of two different elements."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a census of molecular gas in galaxies in the vicinity of the Nobeyama CO Ring, a dense ring of carbon monoxide (CO) emitting galaxies at a distance of 4-5 Mpc from the galactic plane. We used the infra-red CO J=1-0 line to search for molecular gas in galaxies in this area, and found that the number density of molecular galaxies is 1.5+1.3(-1.6) times higher than the number density of star-forming galaxies in the same area, but there is no significant correlation between molecular gas and star-forming gas. We found 13 galaxies with molecular gas (with a total molecular gas mass of 1.4 kpc^2) in a field of 1.3 deg^2, and four of these galaxies are classified as barred spiral galaxies. The total molecular gas mass in the barred spiral galaxies is 0.4 kpc^2, which is equivalent to 30% of the total gas mass in the field. The gas distribution in the barred spiral galaxies is different from that in the non-barred spiral galaxies, and the gas in the barred spiral galaxies is more efficiently converted into stars. We found four main gas distributions in the barred spiral galaxies, and all of them are compatible with the assumption that the gas is released from the bar. We also found a possible link between the location of the gas and the position of the bar, which may provide information on the formation of the bar."}
{"text":"\n\nWe study the stellar configurations which are expected in f(R) theories of gravity in the presence of a cosmological constant and with the inclusion of a non-minimally coupled scalar field. The main focus of the work is the study of the stellar structure of these theories in a formal, semi-numerical way which is not dependent on the detailed implementation of the f(R) theory. We pay particular attention to the properties of the core and to the resulting structure of the astrophysical objects which can be formed. We show that the inclusion of a non-minimally coupled scalar field does not have a strong effect on the core structure and the form of the resulting stellar objects, except for a possible small change in the mass of the core. We also study the properties of the resulting objects in the limit in which the non-minimally coupled scalar field tends to a constant value, and comment on the possible physical implications of the fact that in this limit the stellar objects tend to be less compact."}
{"text":"\nWe discuss the structure and the evolution of the fireball in relativistic heavy ion collisions in the framework of a microscopic theory based on the equations of state (EOS) of the quark-meson plasma. The theory describes the evolution of the fireball structure as a function of the energy and the number of constituent quark-meson pairs, both in the frame of the laboratory and in the frame of the reference system moving with the fireball. The theory is based on the following assumptions: the moment of inertia of the fireball is small compared to the corresponding moment of the constituent quark-meson pairs, the expansion of the fireball is isentrope-like, and the EOS of the quark-meson plasma is given by a contact (fudge) model. We show that the evolution of the fireball has two different regimes. In the initial regime, the fireball expands isentrope-like with a slowly increasing volume, while in the final regime the volume increases much faster. The mass of the fireball does not change in the initial regime, while it decreases in the final regime. We evaluate the differential and the integralEddington numbers in the framework of the theory, and discuss the main features of the theory."}

In particular, we show that (1) the r-process element abundance in Scorpii 1994 is a factor of ~ 2.5 lower than in NH Rosalinde, (2) the elements with very low r-process abundance in the solar twin are enhanced in Scorpii 1994, (3) the p-process element abundance in Scorpii 1994 is a factor of ~ 2.7 lower than in NH Rosalinde, (4) the element ratios of the p-process elements in Scorpii 1994 are close to the r-process element ratios, and (5) the X-ray element abundance in Scorpii 1994 is a factor of ~ 2.2 lower than in NH Rosalinde. These differences in chemical properties between Scorpii 1994 and NH Rosalinde cannot be explained by the known r- and p-process contributions in intermediate-mass stars, and thus may be indicative of an additional chemical enrichment process, such as the r- and p-process effects in low-mass objects. Our results also suggest that the X-ray element abundance in Scorpii 1994 may have been affected by the accretion shock heating during the last orbital evolution."}
{"text":"\n\nWe show that phonons, in a certain range of phonon frequencies, can provide an effective pairing mechanism for superconductivity, without the need of any additional charge transfer between the superconducting layers. We demonstrate this by studying the superconducting properties of a multilayered thin film structure of dielectric and superconducting YBa2Cu3O7\u2212\u03b4 (YBCO) and Y2BaCuO5 (Y211) layers, grown on a buffer layer of LaAlO3 and an SrTiO3 substrate. The dielectric YBCO layer was found to enhance the superconductivity in the Y211 layer, when the phonon frequencies in the YBCO layer are tuned in a certain range. We explain this enhancement by the formation of a pseudogap state in the Y211 layer, induced by a phonon-phonon coupling between the superconducting layers. Our results suggest that a careful design of the structural properties of the superconducting material, which affects the phonon spectrum, may provide an alternative way to design high-T_c superconducting materials by utilizing conventional charge carriers and phonons, without the need of the relatively more difficult to achieve charge transfer pairing."}
{"text":"\nWe consider the asymptotics for the duration of a Markov chain with long range dependence and driven by an external input. The motivation for this work is the desire to better understand the interplay between the driving input and the underlying Markov chain. We consider both the case where the input is a pure jump process and the case where the input is a general Markov chain. We find that the long range dependence of the Markov chain significantly affects the asymptotics for the duration. In particular, we show that if the Markov chain is not long range dependent then the duration behaves like the number of steps of the Markov chain. However, if the Markov chain is long range dependent then the duration grows like the product of the number of steps and the size of the state space. In both cases we obtain an explicit formula for the duration in terms of the Markov chain and the input. We also obtain an explicit formula for the expected number of steps in the case where the input is a pure jump process."}
{"text":"\n\nWe studied the activity rhythms of two sympatric parasitic hymenopteran species, Eupelmus orientalis and Eupelmus vuilleti, in order to determine the daily pattern of activity and the effects of temperature on the activity rhythms of these species. We used records of the duration of activity, as observed in the field by a techniques of continuous monitoring of the behaviour of individuals, and used the resulting data to estimate the duration of activity for each day of the year, for each hour of the day, and for each temperature class. We found that the activity rhythm of E. orientalis is bimodal, with a main period of activity during the day, and a secondary period of activity during the night. The activity rhythm of E. vuilleti is trimodal, with a main period of activity during the night, and two secondary periods of activity during the day. We found that the temperature has an effect on the activity rhythms of both species, and that the activity of E. orientalis is depressed at temperatures below 20 \u00b0C, while the activity of E. vuilleti is depressed at temperatures above 30 \u00b0C. We also found that the activity rhythms of both species are modulated by the day:night and season:year cycles."}
{"text":"\n\nWe propose a concise theory of chiral lipid membranes, which describes their structure, symmetry, and dynamic properties in terms of a small number of fundamental parameters. Our theory is based on the assumption that the chiral lipids form a structural network in which the hydrophobic parts of the molecules, due to their strong tendency to avoid water, are highly cross-linked, whereas the hydrophilic parts form an elastic matrix that can accommodate a large amount of water. The theory predicts that the initial static structure of a membrane will have an helical symmetry, due to the chiral nature of the lipids. However, this symmetry will be broken by the addition of water, which will induce a dynamic transition to a structures with a weaker symmetry, such as a lamellar or cubic phases. We show that the theory can quantitatively describe the main features of the dynamic transition, such as the temperature dependence of the mean lifetime of the different phases, and the dependence of the structure and dynamics on the concentration of the lipid. Our results suggest that the dynamics of the transition is governed by the elastic properties of the hydrophilic part of the lipids, and that the strong cross-linking of the hydrophobic part is responsible for the large number of possible alternative structures that can be stabilized by the addition of water."}
{"text":"\n\nWe reared Monoksa dorsiplana, a gregarious ectoparasitoid of the bruchid beetle Pseudopachymeria spinipes in South America, at the laboratory scale to evaluate its potential for biological control. The results obtained in mass rearing experiments were compared with those of laboratory rearing of M. dorsiplana on artificial diet. When reared on artificial diet at the laboratory scale, M. dorsiplana laid 10.2 eggs\/female, while when reared on P. spinipes at the mass rearing scale, M. dorsiplana laid 1,481.4 eggs\/female. The eggs laid on P. spinipes at the mass rearing scale hatched in about 1.0 days, while those laid on artificial diet took about 2.0 days to hatch. Larvae reared on P. spinipes at the mass rearing scale completed development in about 25.0 days, while those reared on artificial diet needed about 30.0 days to reach the pupal stage. These results suggest that M. dorsiplana has the potential for mass rearing, and could be a candidate for the biological control of P. spinipes in South America."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a deeper study of the inner structure of the Perseus galaxy cluster using high-resolution X-ray observations obtained with Chandra and XMM-Newton. We confirm the presence of a large-scale temperature gradient in the gas distribution of the cluster, which appears to be supported by the presence of a large-scale bar structure in the cool core region. We show that the location of the cool core is coincident with the location of the radio source, and that both are oriented along the cluster's major axis. This supports the hypothesis that the radio source is a supermassive black hole (SMBH) which has been activated by a cold accretion flow, and that the cool core gas is the result of the thermal cooling of this accretion flow. We show that the cluster is remarkable for having three times the average number of X-ray sources in its central region, and that the gas distribution in the central region is very clumpy. We find that the clumped gas has a temperature of about 6 keV, while the mean gas temperature of the cluster is about 2 keV. We also present the first evidence of a substantial flow of metal and cosmic ray particles along the cluster's bar structure. We estimate that this flow has a velocity of about 250 km\/s, and that it contains about 6% of the total gas in the cluster. We discuss the origin of this flow, and suggest that it is a stirred-up version of the ICM, rather than the result of an injection event."}
{"text":"\n\nThe Unique Type Ib Supernova 2005bf at Nebular Phases: A Possible Birth Event of A Strongly Magnetized Neutron Star\n\nWe present a detailed study of the unique type Ib supernova (SN) 2005bf and its mysterious source object, an unusual stellar object with extreme magnetic field (B_Fields) and a massive rotating wind that had been losing mass since at least the early 1970s. We find that the properties of the source object are consistent with a low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) containing a weakly magnetized neutron star (NS) with a small (in comparison to the supernova explosion) but extremely fast (over 2000 km\/s) rotating wind, and a very low mass companion star. The explosion of the supernova is found to have a low kinetic energy (KE) of  2.3 kJ, a relatively late-time peak brightness, and a slow (in comparison to other type Ib SNe) decline in brightness. We discuss the possible connection between the unique properties of the source object and the slow explosion of the supernova, in particular, the idea that the NS was not born with a strong magnetic field. We show that if the magnetic field was not strong (B_field < 10 MG) prior to the explosion, the available models of LMXBs are able to produce all of the observed properties of 2005bf, in particular, a slow explosion and a high magnetic field in the remnant NS. We discuss several possibilities that a weakly magnetized NS can be strongly magnetized at some later time, and explain why we think that the accretion-induced magnetic field strengthening is not likely. We also discuss the origin of the relatively low KE of the explosion, which is not well explained by the standard SN models. We conclude that a weakly magnetized NS with a low-mass companion can, after the explosion, become a strongly magnetized NS with a massive but very fast rotating wind, a configuration that is consistent with the observations of 2005bf."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider the Gribov copies of a relativistic point-like massive particle in a spherically symmetric, hard-walled, non-rotating confinement. The Copies are related to the complex structure of the confining potential, which is related to the one-dimensional scalarized Coulomb potential with a shift and a twist in the scalar potential. The full complex structure of the confining potential is determined analytically by the reduction of the three-dimensional problem to a one-dimensional problem, with the help of the Faddeev-Popov ghosts. The effective scalar potential is also determined analytically by the same procedure. The structure of the full potential and its scalar part is related to the behaviour of the relativistic massive particle in a spherical mirror, which is analysed by the method of the accelerated mirrors. We show that the solution with the positive mass has two branches, that with the negative mass has three branches, and that for any value of the mass the solution has an infinite number of branches."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a study of the X-ray emission from the Coma cluster in the region of the cluster's south-west boundary, in the direction of the Leo constellation. We observed the region with the XMM-Newton Observatory, obtaining a total exposure time of almost 9 ks. We find that the observed region is composed of two different sub-regions. The first one is the cluster's south-west boundary, which is the most active part of the cluster, showing a large number of bright X-ray sources, many of which are superluminous. The second sub-region is a featureless, gas-rich region which is probably a dissolve cluster. We have found 19 superluminous X-ray sources in the cluster's south-west boundary, of which 14 are new discoveries. The properties of these new superluminous X-ray sources are consistent with the properties of the known sources in the cluster's core. We have also found one X-ray source in the dissolve cluster, which is slightly superluminous. The morphology and the X-ray properties of the superluminous X-ray sources are consistent with the superluminous X-ray sources being extremely massive X-ray binaries (XBs), with the properties of the disk-gb elements being consistent with the low mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) and the extraordinary XBs (ExXBs) being accreting close-in Jupiters. We discuss the results in the framework of the hypothesis that the massive XBs are primordial, while the LMXBs and the ExXBs are formed by the accretion of close-in Jupiters onto the massive XBs."}
{"text":"\n\nAbstract\nThis article presents a self-affirmation model for football goal distributions. The motivation for the research is that while previous studies have examined the impact of several factors on the distribution of football goals, few studies have examined the impact of self-affirmation on the distribution of football goals. The key ideas and methodology are that the researchers used the survival analysis to examine the impact of self-affirmation on the distribution of football goals. The researchers used the goals data from the 2014\/15 and 2015\/16 English Premier League. The results obtained are that the distribution of goals in the first half is significantly different from the distribution of goals in the second half, and the distribution of goals in the first half is significantly different from the distribution of goals in the second half in the second half. The problem this work attempts to solve is that previous studies have not examined the impact of self-affirmation on the distribution of football goals. This work provides a self-affirmation model for football goal distributions.\n\nThe practical and theoretical applications of this work include providing a basis for predicting the distribution of football goals and providing a basis for understanding the impact of self-affirmation on the distribution of football goals.\n\nThis work has implications for future research in that it provides a basis for examining the impact of self-affirmation on the distribution of football goals."}
{"text":"\nWe present a numerical investigation of the effects of spatially distributed ionisation sources on the temperature structure of HII regions. We find that the presence of ionisation sources has little effect on the temperature structure of the gas, except in the immediate vicinity of the sources. We discuss the results in the context of the observed temperature structure of HII regions and the effects of massive ionisation sources, such as supernovae, on the gas temperature. We find that massive ionisation sources are likely to have a significant effect on the gas temperature in their immediate vicinity, but are unlikely to have a significant effect on the global temperature structure of the HII region. We also discuss the effects of distributed sources such as Wolf-Rayet stars, and find that they are likely to have only a very small effect on the gas temperature. We therefore suggest that the temperature structure of HII regions is primarily set by the balance between ionisation and recombination, rather than by the presence of individual ionisation sources."}
{"text":"\nWe present here the results of a pilot study of the ELAIS N1 field, obtained with the Submillimeter High Angular Resolution Camera (SHARC) instrument on the SOFIA observatory. We report the discovery of six compact sources in the field, all of them associated with the ELAIS cluster and two of them showing clear signs of polarization. The four most compact sources are the most polarized sources found so far in the ELAIS cluster. The analysis of the polarization of the two most compact sources, performed with the Submillimeter Multi-Beam Polarimeter (SMBP) on the SCUBA-2 instrument on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT), shows that they are radio sources with a very high degree of polarization (up to 80%), most probably due to the presence of a strong magnetic field. The other compact sources found in ELAIS N1 are not highly polarized, but they still have a significant degree of polarization (up to 20%). We also report on a candidate polarized source in the ELAIS N2 field observed with the same instrumental setup, and a candidate magnetic source in the ELAIS N3 field observed with the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR), which could be a member of the ELAIS cluster."}
{"text":"\n\nWe investigate the role of the initial phase of a rapidly oscillating potential in the subsequent particle motion. We consider a particle moving in a potential which is a sum of a DC field and a rapidly oscillating field, with the oscillations being at a frequency much higher than the inverse of the transit time of the particle through the potential. We find that the initial phase of the rapidly oscillating field has a strong effect on the subsequent particle motion, in a way which is not captured by a simplified model in which the rapidly oscillating field is turned on and off at fixed times. Our results are consistent with a model in which the rapidly oscillating field is treated as a source of a steady-state current which immediately changes the DC field in a way which depends on the initial phase of the rapidly oscillating field. The change in the DC field in turn affects the particle motion. We explain how our results can be used to design new types of atom interferometers which are based on rapidly oscillating potentials."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present the first measurement of the direct photon plus jet production cross section in hadron collisions at \\sqrt{s}=14 TeV performed with the CMS detector at the LHC. The analysis is based on the data collected in 2016 by the CMS collaboration, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.8 fb-1 of collision events containing hadron jets. The cross section is measured for events with two jets and a photon produced in the same hadron collision, in the mass region around 1 TeV. The analysis uses the minimum-bias trigger, selecting events with two jets of hadron-Hadron calorimeter (HCAL) energy above 2.5 GeV, and a photon of energy above 1 GeV produced in the same event. We observe a cross section in good agreement with next-to-leading order theory, corrected for non-perturbative effects, such as jet quenching and jet merging. We also measure the differential cross section as a function of the hadron jet momentum, and find a good agreement with theory, which includes non-perturbative contributions. The measurement is in agreement with theoretical predictions based on the perturbative theory, with a statistical uncertainty of \\sim 3\\% and a systematic uncertainty of \\sim 7%. The results are used to constrain the non-perturbative corrections to the theory and to test the reliability of the perturbative approach to describe the data."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a density functional theory and exact Muffin-Tin (DFT+U) computation of the electronic structure and spin-state energetics of the heme molecule. The goal of this work is to evaluate the accuracy of DFT+U methods in describing the spin-state energetics of transition metal complexes. We focus on the model system heme, which has well-defined spin-state properties, including an open-shell spin-state and a well-defined low-spin state with a relatively small energy difference between the two spin-states. The heme system also provides a benchmark for the evaluation of the breakup of the molecular orbitals into atomic contributions. Our results indicate that the simple DFT+U approach is not adequate for the accurate prediction of the heme spin-state energetics. We find that the biggest deficiency is the failure of the DFT+U method to describe the orbital breakup of the molecular orbitals. We propose that this deficiency may be cured by a more sophisticated treatment of the U, which includes a proper treatment of the correlation effects in the molecular orbitals."}
{"text":"\nWe present a systematic study of the long-term evolution of a large sample of massive black hole binaries in collisional nuclei. We consider the relaxation of the orbits due to gravitational radiation and tidal interactions, and the effect of these interactions on the spin and temperature evolution of the black holes. We find that the frequency distribution of the orbital period is well described by a power law with a direct current cut-off, and that the black holes can be efficiently spun-up by gravitational interactions, but only for orbital periods larger than a few hours. We also find that the black hole temperature is influenced by the efficiency of the spin-up process, which can be very efficient for low-mass X-ray binaries in tight orbits, leading to very hot black holes. For massive black hole binaries, the evolution of the temperature is governed by the energy exchange between the two objects, and the efficiency of the spin-up process is very small, leading to low-mass X-ray binaries in wide orbits and with very low temperature. We discuss the implications of our results for the evolution of massive black hole binaries and the origin of the different populations of low-mass X-ray binaries observed in the Galaxy."}
{"text":"\n\nWe study the ground state and low--lying excited states of square and triangular lattice Heisenberg models with Neel order by using the toolkit of analytical dynamics.

(1) The ground state of the triangular lattice Heisenberg model with Neel order is a fully frustrated state with eight distinct magnetic domains, two on each square lattice site. (2) By using an additional parameter that controls the strength of the Coulomb interaction, we are able to interpolate between the ground state with eight domains and the square lattice Heisenberg model with Neel order, which has only one domain. (3) We found an exact mapping from the low--lying excited states of the square lattice Heisenberg model with Neel order to those of the triangular lattice Heisenberg model with Neel order, after an appropriate transformation of the eigenvectors.

{"text":"\n\nWe consider the problem of spontaneous breaking of an internal symmetry in self-dual critical Z(N) spin systems. We review the proposals of CFT predictions for this problem, in the framework of the twist-partition function (TPF) formalism. We analyze the effects of the relevant operators in the Hamiltonian which break the internal symmetry, and of their couplings to the TPFs. We show that the available CFT techniques for the analysis of the low-lying spectrum of finite dimensional statistical manifolds can be used to study the symmetry breaking process in the critical systems. In particular, we derive simple formulas for the SLE induced by the relevant operators, in terms of the TPFs and certain kinds of matrix elements. We analyze the behavior of these SLE in the limit of large system size, and find a qualitative difference between the SLE induced by the symplectic and the anti-symplectic parts of the relevant operators. We also consider the question of the existence of a spectrum gap in the thermodynamic limit, and discuss the relation of our results to the recent suggestions of CFT for the possible structure of the SLE in finite dimensional critical systems."}

{"text":"\n\nWe investigate the role of black hole (BH) motion on the dynamical evolution of stellar orbits in galactic nuclei. We consider a simple model of a galactic nucleus consisting of a central massive black hole, a disc of orbiting matter and a assumed cylindrical distribution of dark matter (DM). We study the dynamics of this system by means of a two-dimensional (2D) general relativistic hydrodynamical model and show that the black hole motion can excite an instability in the disc, which in turn leads to the development of orbital resonances. Our analysis shows that these resonances are associated with the three characteristic orbital frequencies of the galactic nucleus, which can be excited by the regular motion of the black hole. In this way, the black hole motion acts as a catalyst of the orbital resonance. We discuss the role of the assumption of a cylindrical distribution of DM in the developed resonance structure and the effect of the relaxation of the DM density profile. We show that the resulting resonance structure is in agreement with the observed dynamics of the stellar orbits in the galactic nuclei."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider a Yamabe-type problem for compact spinor manifolds. We show that such a problem can be converted to a spectral problem for a symmetric indefinite metric on a projective manifold. The solution of the symmetric indefinite metric problem forms the bulk of the paper. The key ingredients are a characterization of the differential of a symmetric indefinite metric and an estimate for the spectrum of the Laplace operator on a spinor manifold. We show that the symmetric indefinite metric problem has a solution if and only if the spinor manifold is dereticesque. We use the differential to give a description of the solutions of the symmetric indefinite metric problem in terms of special Lagrangian subspaces of the spinor space. We show that our description of the solutions has an analogue in the case of Lagrangian subspaces of the symmetric definite metric on a spinor manifold. As an application, we give an alternative description of dereticesque spinor manifolds in terms of Lagrangian subspaces."}
{"text":"\nWe consider a thought experiment based on the Bohr-Einstein photon box. The motivation for our work is to understand the complementarity inherent in the quantum theory of light. We show that if we try to prepare a pure state of a single-photon in a photon box, then we can only achieve this in a limited number of ways. The analysis of these possibilities shows that the complementarity principle is encoded in the dynamics of the photon box. In particular, we find a clear signature of the standard complementarity principle in the form of a distinction between a quantum-mechanical and a classical (winning- Ticket) approach to a quantum-optical game. We also show that if we try to prepare a mixed state of a single-photon in a photon box, then the dynamics of the photon box will always be such that the final state will be well described by a thermal mixture. Our analysis shows that this fact is encoded in the dynamics of the photon box, in the form of a distinction between a quantum-mechanical and a classical (winning-Ticket) approach to a quantum-optical game."}
{"text":"\n\nWe investigate a quantum system composed of two uncorrelated photons, which can be thought of as a special case of the Einstein-Bohr photon box. We find a strong analogy with the usual (classical) photon box, in the sense that one can define a suitable analogue of the meta-stable state which has a real probability to be realized. However, unlike the classical case, the state with two photons has a very peculiar statistical structure: although the individual photon detectors have a 50 % chance to register a photon, the probability that both detectors simultaneously register a photon is only about 10 %. We analyze this incompleteness from the point of view of the formalism of quantum mechanics, and we show that it can be understood as a consequence of the non-locality of the quantum state. We finally draw a lesson from this example, in the form of a heuristic principle which we call \"complementarity of the resources\". This principle, which is inspired on the complementarity of the outcomes in the Einstein-Bohr photon box, can be thought of as a generalization of the usual concept of quantum complementarity. We illustrate the application of this principle with the example of a thought experiment concerning a \"quantum Cheshire cat\"."}
{"text":"\nWe consider a system of one or several particles which interact with a general environment and are subject to an external force. We study the solution of the corresponding master equations of quantum brownian motion in the presence of an external force. The main tool to achieve this goal is the relationship between the solution of the master equation and the solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation for the system. This relationship is obtained by using the formalism of path integrals. The solution of the master equation is shown to have a simple form in terms of the Wronskian basis functions. In the particular case of an external force acting along a certain direction and an environment which does not depend on the position coordinates, the solution of the master equation can be obtained in closed form. In this case, the problem is equivalent to the study of the motion of a particle in an external field, with the exception that the solution is dressed with the additional degrees of freedom due to the interaction with the environment. The external field in this case is not limited to be a conservative field. We show that the solution of the master equation is related to the solution of the Laplace equation for the potential field."}

{"text":"\n\nThe Galactic Central Diffuse X-ray Enhancement: A Differential Absorption\/Emission Analysis\n\nWe present a systematic analysis of the Galactic central diffuse X-ray enhancement (DXE), based on an improved description of the interstellar medium and a detailed comparison between observations and theoretical predictions. Our aim is to assess the current theoretical understanding of the DXE, with particular focus on the key physical processes that may give rise to the observed X-ray emission. We show that a simple model, based on a uniform distribution of X-ray absorbing material, cannot reproduce the observed properties of the DXE. In particular, we find that the observed X-ray surface brightness is inconsistent with the predictions of such models. We show that this inconsistency can be resolved by a model which includes a clumpy distribution of X-ray absorbing material, and that such a model is consistent with the observed radial and azimuthal variations of the DXE. We also show that the observed X-ray spectrum is consistent with the predictions of a simple model which includes only one X-ray emitting region, located at the center of the Galaxy. Our results suggest that the observed DXE may be due to a combination of a clumpy distribution of X-ray absorbing material and an X-ray emitting region located at the Galactic center. We discuss several physical processes which may give rise to the observed DXE, and we outline future research directions."}
{"text":"\n\nWe discuss some aspects of the measurement error in linear regression of astronomical data. We show that the classical model of measurement error, based on the assumption of independent and identically distributed errors, is not adequate for data sets containing few data points, as is often the case in astronomy. We then propose a simple model which takes into account the fact that the standard deviation of the error is proportional to the square root of the number of data points. We analyze the influence of the measurement error on the shape of the regression function and on the significance of the regression coefficients. We also derive a simple formula for the optimal number of data points necessary to achieve a given level of statistical significance. This formula is evaluated numerically for several example data sets, and its practical use is illustrated by a discussion of the problem of the optimal duration of a transient monitoring program. We also derive a simple formula for the probability distribution of a test statistic which is commonly used to test the significance of a regression coefficient. This formula is evaluated numerically and shown to provide a good approximation to the distribution of the test statistic for moderate sample sizes."}

It is essential for understanding the formation and evolution of planetary systems, as well as for developing the theoretical basis for the detection and characterization methods used to study exoplanets.\n\nOne of the key ideas in dynamical research is the concept of stability. This is the idea that a system will tend to evolve towards a state that is stable, in the sense that it is not likely to be disturbed by small perturbations. This is an important concept for understanding the structure of planetary systems, as well as for developing methods for detecting and characterizing exoplanets.\n\nDynamical research has also played a critical role in the development of methods for detecting exoplanets. For example, the idea of applying the techniques of statistical mechanics to the analysis of astronomical data was first developed by astronomers, and has been an essential tool in the study of exoplanets.\n\nThe results obtained from dynamical research have been used to develop a number of theoretical models for explaining the observed properties of exoplanets. These models have been used to make predictions about the properties of exoplanets, and to test the predictions against observations.\n\nThe practical applications of dynamical research in the study of exoplanets include the development of methods for detecting and characterizing exoplanets, and the application of these methods to the analysis of data from astronomical observations.\n\nIn conclusion, dynamical research plays a critical role in the detection and characterization of exoplanets.

{"text":"\n\nWe revisit the problem of the slow dynamics of a silica melt, using Monte Carlo simulations. We consider the stochastic model recently proposed by Tatara et al. (J. Chem. Phys., 2016, 145, 034105) to describe the molecular dynamics of a silica melt, and we use Monte Carlo simulations to study the relaxation of density and temperature fluctuations in this model. We find that the relaxation times of the density and temperature fluctuations are very long, of the order of $10^{1000}$ and $10^{100}$ respectively. In order to investigate the origin of these long relaxation times, we study the distribution of the probabilities $p_x$ of finding the system in the state $x$ at a given time, for several initial conditions. We show that these distributions are very narrow, and we relate this result to the small value of the variance $\\Delta\\dot x^2\/\\dot x$ in the system. We also show that the $p_x$ distributions are not symmetric, and that their asymmetry is related to the initial conditions. We finally discuss the physical meanings of these results."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a method for simulation of single reed instrument oscillations based on the modal decomposition of bore and reed dynamics. The governing equations for the dynamic behavior of a single reed instrument are formulated in the basis of the thin-shell theory and the method of stationary stress. The problem is then solved by the FEM method. The Modal Decomposition (MD) technique is applied to reduce the computation efforts. In the MD method the instrument is considered as a linear system with multiple degrees of freedom (DOF). Each DOF has a proper dynamic model. The technique of theNormal Mode Analysis is used to identify the dynamic model of each DOF. The identified dynamic models are then assembled to obtain the total model of the instrument. The proposed method is applied to simulate the dynamic behavior of a single reed instrument. The results are compared with the available experimental data. The obtained good agreement between the simulation results and the experiment proves the effectiveness of the proposed method."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a detailed study of the gas and dust spectra of the D' type symbiotic star HD330036. We find a non-magnetic white dwarf with a relatively high temperature of about 27 kK, which is not very different from the temperature of the companion star. We show that the white dwarf is not an old white dwarf which has been around for many years, but was formed recently from a much hotter ONeMg WD. We estimate the mass of the WD to be about 0.69 M\u2299. The mass of the companion star is only 0.29 M\u2299. We show that the chemical composition of the gas is nearly identical to that of the WD, implying that the accretion disc is not efficiently mixing with the companion star. We explain this in terms of a large inner gap in the disc. We find that the accretion disc has a mass of only about 0.01 M\u2299, which implies that the disc lifetime is about 1000 years. We show that the disc cannot be a massive hot Jupiter, as it has too low a mass, and is too cold. We find that the disc is very inefficient at infalling material, with an accretion rate of only about 10-4M\u2299yr-1. This implies that the disc is mostly made up of dust, with a mass of about 0.001 M\u2299. We show that this low mass is consistent with a large inner gap. We discuss several possible mechanisms for disc formation, and conclude that a disc is likely to have formed recently through a gravitational instability. We find that the disc is a very inefficient accretor, and is likely to be a dust disc with a mass of only about 0.001 M\u2299."}
{"text":"\nWe present observations of the linear polarization of SN 1987A at lambda 6cm. Our observations were made with the Millimeter-wave Astronomy Laboratory's 30-element photoconductive antenna array at a wavelength of 4600 Angstroms, in three sessions on 2001 Oct. 24, 25, and 26. We find that the polarization of SN 1987A is depolarized, with a partial polarization of (8.3 +\/- 1.1) percent and a linear polarization variability of (13.7 +\/- 2.0) percent. We find that the degree of polarization is correlated with the mass-loss rate, as estimated from the 6cm flux density, in a way that is consistent with a scenario in which the bulk of the SN 1987A ejecta is velocity-selected at a critical velocity, with a distribution of particle velocities that is superimposed on this selected core. We show that this core has a (power law) velocity distribution with an index of -1.6 +\/- 0.3, and a total pressure-to-acceleration ratio of (1.2 +\/- 0.1) mm Newton per kg. We find that the correlation between mass loss and polarization is consistent with a simple model in which the critical velocity is located at the peak of the velocity distribution, and in which the polarization degree is proportional to the ratio of the mass-loss rate to the critical velocity. This model predicts a linear polarization variability that is in good agreement with our observations. We discuss several alternate mechanisms that might give rise to this correlation."}
{"text":"\nWe present a model of the symbiotic star H1-36, based on a composite of the line and continuum spectra from radio to ultraviolet. Our motivation for constructing this model is to better understand the nature of this unique star, which has been known since 1943 but whose origin and evolution are still not completely understood. We have used a combination of data from several sources, including archival data from the Hubble Space Telescope, to construct a model that explains the various features in the H1-36 spectrum. Our model suggests that the symbiotic star is composed of a red giant and a hot, compact object, such as a white dwarf or a neutron star, which is accreting matter from the giant. The model also explains the various line and continuum features in the spectrum, including the broad hydrogen lines, the continuum emission, and the X-ray and ultraviolet data. Our work provides a new and more complete understanding of the symbiotic star H1-36, and it has implications for the evolution of massive stars and the structure of the cores of giant stars."}
{"text":"\n\nWe study a pulse-coupled network in which the dynamics of the individual nodes are symmetrically coupled to their symmetric neighbors. We show analytically and numerically that such a network can be stochastically stable in a symmetric splay state, in which the pulses are aligned in a fully symmetric way along the four diagonals of the square lattice. In a regular lattice, the symmetric splay state is shown to be stable against changes in the symmetry of the coupling. However, in a lattice with a small but finite number of faults, the symmetric splay state is not necessarily stable against changes in the symmetry of the coupling: if the coupling is symmetric, the splay state can be stable, but if the coupling is anti-symmetric, the splay state can be unstable. We also study the long-time behavior of the symmetric splay state. For a large class of couplings, the symmetric splay state is shown to be quasi-stationary, in the sense that the amplitude of the pulses is constant in time, while the phases vary in a symmetric way. We also show that the symmetric splay state is nearly efficient, in the sense that the total energy is almost equally distributed among the nodes. Finally, we consider a generalization of the symmetric splay state to higher dimensions."}
{"text":"\nWe consider the problem of anomalous diffusive reaction rates on realistic self-affine fractals. We show that such reaction rates are related to the thermal conductivity of the fractal, and that this conductivity in turn is related to the volume conductivities of the positive and negative fractal components. These relationships provide a possible physical explanation for the large number of microscopic reaction channels that are typically associated with anomalous reaction rates on fractals. We analyze the simplest case of a self-affine fractal in one dimension, and evaluate the conductivity of a fractal as a function of its fractal dimension. We find that the conductivity tends to decrease rapidly with increasing fractal dimension, and we show that this decrease is related to the large number of necks or connectors between the positive and negative fractal components. In two and higher dimensions, we find that the conductivity of a fractal is proportional to the product of its volume conductivity and its fractal dimension. We show that this proportionality is consistent with the assumption that the conductivity is related to the average number of connectors per volume. We also derive a simple expression for the conductivity of a self-affine fractal as a function of its fractal dimension in any number of dimensions."}
{"text":"\n\nQuantum Theory of Flicker Noise in Metal Films\nWe investigate the problem of flicker noise in metal films from the point of view of quantum theory. We derive a simple and general expression for the mean square fluctuation of the resistivity in terms of the frequency-dependent part of the resistivity, the spectral weight function, and the temperature. This expression is equivalent to the Boltzmann equation for the random field, from which the different types of flicker noise can be derived as special cases. We analyze in detail the case of pure thermal noise, and show that in this case the theory predicts a noise minimum instead of a noise maximum, as usually assumed in the literature. Our result for the spectral weight function in the thermodynamic limit is in good agreement with the experimental data of Bednarska-Bzd\u0229ga and requrires an additional parameter which is not a priori clear. The theory also explains the mechanism of the low-frequency deviation from the Johnson-Mehl-Avrami behavior, as well as the temperature dependence of the flicker noise in the whole range of frequencies."}

Our solution takes advantage of the routing mechanisms available in the network layer to achieve our objectives. In particular, our scheme uses the gossip protocol to disseminate the information about the queues in the access points (APs) throughout the network. Then, each AP makes its own admission decision based on the information it has collected and the local policy it follows. We evaluate our scheme through simulations, and the results show that our scheme achieves a throughput very close to the optimal one, a fairness level similar to the one achieved by the IEEE 802.11e EDCA (Enhanced Distributed Coordination Access) protocol, and a delay lower than the one achieved by the 802.11e EDCA protocol."}

The system is modeled by a Markovian finite-state machine, and the bonds are broken and formed according to a specified algorithm. The algorithm is designed to have a finite number of bond-breaking steps, so that the system remains finite. We show that this model can be efficiently sampled using a auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo method, in which the auxiliary field is a linear combination of the bonds being formed. The method is exact, and the convergence is guaranteed by a simple limit relation. We analyze the parameters of the method, and show how to optimize the sampling efficiency.

{"text":"\n\nWe present a comprehensive study of massive galaxies at z~2 based on the UV and optical data from Hubble, and optical data from ground-based telescopes. Our main goal is to investigate the relation between star formation and galaxy growth at this epoch, when massive galaxies are still in the 'early' stages of their evolution. We find that star formation in massive galaxies at z~2 is characterised by a large number of relatively low mass star-forming galaxies, a few extremely massive galaxies with very high star formation rates, and a strong correlation between star formation rate and galaxy mass, even at these early times. We show that the high star formation rate galaxies (defined as galaxies with log SFR > 2.5) are likely to be the ancestors of the most massive galaxies in the local universe, and that their evolution has been characterised by a rapid increase in mass, whereas the number of galaxies has remained approximately constant. We show that the massive galaxies in the local universe have grown through the accretion of stars, gas and dust from their smaller neighbours, and that this process has been extremely efficient, with the efficiency of accretion events increasing sharply with the mass of the accreting galaxy. We argue that this efficient accretion has been possible because massive galaxies have always had a large impact on their smaller neighbours, regulating the evolution of their stellar populations. We conclude that the massive galaxies in the local universe are the survivors of a harsh selection process that has taken place during the last eight billion years, and that this process is likely to have been efficient enough to produce the population of massive galaxies we observe in the local universe from the relatively small number of massive galaxies at z~2."}
{"text":"\nWe present a unique, extensive, and detailed set of multiwavelength observations of a sample of galaxies at intermediate redshift (z < 1), with a special focus on massive galaxies (M > 1011 M\u2299). Our principal aim is to test the hypothesis that massive galaxies at this redshift are mainly \"empty\" Compton-thin galaxies and that their massive stellar populations arise through minor mergers, in a fashion similar to the way in which low-mass galaxies form today. Our data set includes ultraviolet, optical, near-infrared, and mid-infrared photometry, as well as sensitive radio and X-ray observations. We find that at most redshifts (and in all probability at all redshifts), massive galaxies are not Compton-thin. Rather, their gas distribution is more reminiscent of that in galaxies at low redshift, and of the sort that would be expected if galaxies grew via major mergers. The massive stellar populations in these galaxies are extremely old (8\u201310 Gyr), which is consistent with the hypothesis that they formed in a few major events. We conclude that massive galaxies in the early universe grew via major mergers, and that the same process of major merger continues to this day."}
{"text":"\nWe motivate and introduce a framework for a unifying field theory in d+2 spacetime that unifies the frameworks for the d-1 and d+1 emergent spacetimes in a way that provides a basis for a general theory of Emergent Einsteinian spacetimes in arbitrary spacetime dimensions.

We show that the general theory leads to Emergent Maxwellian and Emergent Einsteinian spacetimes in arbitrary dimensions, which have different internal structures, and that both can be obtained as limits of the general theory in different limits of the d+2 spacetime dimensions. The Emergent Einsteinian spacetimes in arbitrary spacetime dimensions are shown to be equivalent to the d-1 Emergent Einsteinian spacetime in a limit in which the d+1 spacetime dimension becomes \"infinitely large\".

{"text":"\n\nDependence of hillslope moisture content on downhill saturation\n\nSoil moisture plays a key role in many geomorphological processes such as soil erosion and dust emission. We present a model that enables us to investigate the dependence of the hillslope moisture content on downhill saturation. Our model consists of a semi-quantitative description of the soil moisture balance based on a mass-balance approach. We use this model to study the effect of soil-moisture-holding capacity and surface runoff on the distribution of soil moisture on hillslopes. The model enables us to make a clear distinction between the transient and the equilibrium distribution of soil moisture, which is not possible when using a more complex soil-moisture-balance model. By means of numerical experiments we show that our model is able to reproduce the well-known curvature of the soil moisture curve observed on hillslopes. Our results also show that the soil moisture distribution is very sensitive to the input of additional water at the top of the hillslope. We discuss the possible mechanisms that may cause such a sensitivity and possible applications of our model."}
{"text":"\nWe report on a superconductor electromechanical clock with a quality factor of << 10^6. The device consists of a superconducting loop with a single-turn secondary coil. The primary coil is used to generate a magnetic field over a Josephson junction which is located in the loop. The supercurrent through the junction is induced by the magnetic field and is opposed by the critical current of the junction. The critical current is modulated by a DC current bias and the supercurrent is reset by a thermo-mechanical mechanism. The dynamic behavior of the supercurrent is found to be in good agreement with the analytical model presented in this paper. The mechanism of the device is such that the energy losses due to the finite thermal and mechanical relaxation time are negligible. This makes it possible to reach very high quality factors. The current-voltage characteristics of the Josephson junction and the frequency of the induced supercurrent are stable over a wide range of temperature, bias current, and external magnetic field."}
{"text":"\n\nWe investigate the capacity of sparse multipath channels in the ultra-wideband (UWB) regime. We show that in this regime, the capacity is closely related to the number of paths, in a way that is very different from that in narrowband channels. In particular, we show that for a large number of paths the capacity is upper bounded by the number of paths, whereas for a small number of paths it grows sub-linearly with the number of paths. We explain this phenomenon by investigating the behavior of the achievable rate region (ARR) as the number of paths grows. Our results show that the capacity is closely related to the number of dominant paths, and that it is not sensitive to the presence of a large number of weak paths. This is in contrast to narrowband channels, where the capacity is sensitive to the number of weak paths. Our results have practical implications, and in particular they suggest that an efficient utilization of UWB channels may require a different type of receiver from that used in narrowband channels."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate the non-coherent capacity and reliability of sparse multipath channels in the wideband regime.

We show that in this scenario, which is more realistic for many wideband channels, the non-coherent capacity is significantly larger than the coherent capacity. To this end, we derive a simple formula for the non-coherent capacity which only involves the number of paths and the average path coefficient. In addition, we investigate the effect of partial coherence on the reliability of communication over such channels.

{"text":"\nWe present a global analysis of the polarization of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) in non-central heavy ion collisions at high energies. We find that the degree of polarization of the QGP has a strong dependence on the transverse momentum (pT) of the collision system, and on the number of participating nucleons in the system. In particular, we show that the fraction of polarized nucleons in the QGP increases strongly with the number of participating nucleons, while it is almost independent of the pT of the system. Our results are consistent with the idea that the nucleons in the QGP can be approximately described by a kinetic model in which the helical motion of the nucleons is driven by the spin of the antiquarks, and in which the polarization of the nucleons is due to the statistical correlation between the antiquarks and the nucleons. We also present a simple physical model which describes the evolution of the polarization of the QGP in heavy ion collisions. Our results suggest that the polarization of the QGP is governed by the same mechanisms which are responsible for the polarization of the hadron jets produced in heavy ion collisions."}

In this Part II, we consider the noisy case. We assume that the data is generated by independently flipping coins, and that each coin has some probability p of landing heads, and 1-p of landing tails. We assume that each coin flip is independent of the others, and that the probability p is the same for each flip.

{"text":"\n\nWe present secondary B-mode polarization data for the cluster and field galaxies selected from the Cluster Lensing Map (CLoGS) survey, obtained with the W.M. Keck Observatory's OH-suppressing B-mode Polarization Camera (ObBO). We show that Faraday rotation in the intergalactic medium (IGM) is a significant source of secondary B-mode polarization in both clusters and field galaxies, and that it is possible to constrain the Faraday rotation angle in a statistical sense. The typical Faraday rotation angle in the IGM is found to be small, on the order of a few degrees, and is independent of cluster or field galaxy properties such as redshift, star formation rate, or accretion rate. The results are consistent with a picture in which field and cluster galaxies are embedded in a nearly homogenous IGM, and in which large-scale structure does not affect the Faraday rotation angle. The small Faraday rotation angle suggests that a relatively small number of passages through the IGM, perhaps only one or two, can account for the secondary B-mode polarization signal in most of the galaxies. We find that a simple model in which the IGM consists of a single layer of parallel magnetic fields can quantitatively reproduce the observed secondary B-mode polarization signal in clusters and field galaxies, provided that the IGM has a small Faraday rotation angle. In this model, the amplitude of the secondary B-mode polarization signal is simply proportional to the square of the ratio of the Faraday rotation angle to the angle between the galaxy's polarization plane and the magnetic field direction in the IGM. Our results suggest that a statistical analysis of secondary B-mode polarization data can provide a powerful constraint on the structure of the IGM."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present observations of the optically obscured accretion disks in a sample of 58 obscured active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the Chandra Deep Field South, selected from the Asada database.

The lowest accretion rate measured in our sample is 5 \u00d7 10^( \u2212 3) M_(\u2299) yr^( \u2212 1), only 1% of the classical prediction. The disk-to-galaxy angular ratio is in agreement with predictions based on the assumption of a wind-driven disk, but significantly higher than expected from a purely viscous disk. The lowest observed disk-to-galaxy ratio is 2.5, at an accretion rate of 5 \u00d7 10^( \u2212 3) M_(\u2299) yr^( \u2212 1), suggesting that the inner disk is truncated by the central engine at low accretion rates. We conclude that the prevalence of low accretion rates and truncated disks in obscured AGN implies the presence of a strong feedback mechanism that has not been included in the classic model. The low accretion rates observed in our sample also suggest that the classic model, which predicts that the accretion rate is proportional to the accretion disk surface area, needs to be modified. We discuss possible physical mechanisms that may give rise to the observations, and we suggest that a comprehensive model of obscured AGN needs to include a feedback mechanism and a revised relation between the accretion rate and the disk surface area."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate the propagation of electromagnetic waves in an almost circular bundle of closely packed, metallic, carbon nanotubes. The effective permeability and permittivity of the nanotubes are obtained from their constitutive relations. We then solve the three-dimensional (3D) electromagnetic problem for a lossless nanotube bundle, and obtain the transmitted field in the bundle as a function of the wave number and the radius of the bundle. We observe a strong singularity in the transmitted field at the gap between the nanotubes, which is due to the fact that the bundle is almost circular. This singularity can be removed by a simple procedure, which results in an analytical expression for the transmitted field in the lossless nanotube bundle. We also investigate the effect of loss on the transmitted field, and find that the lossy bundle behaves like a localized metasurface. Finally, we show that our analytical expression for the transmitted field in the lossless nanotube bundle can be used to design a leaky waveguide with a high-permeability core and a low-permeivity cladding."}

We consider a statistical ensemble of nanospheres aligned in a chain along their common short axis, and study the influence of a magnetic field on the chain by means of Monte Carlo simulations. We find that a finite magnetization can be achieved when the ratio of the long to the short axis of the spheres is larger than a critical value. For a given direction of the magnetic field, the magnetization is highest at the end of the chain and exhibits a sharp peak, which is in good agreement with the theoretical prediction. We also find that the chains exhibit a uniaxial anisotropy with the direction of the short axis of the spheres, in spite of the fact that this direction is not fully aligned with the direction of the magnetic field. The strong dependence of the anisotropy and the magnetization on the shape of the hollow spheres is also studied. The results are in good agreement with theoretical predictions based on the analysis of the torque on a single sphere. We also discuss a new type of magnetic nanocomposite based on chains of magnetic nanospheres embedded in a non-magnetic matrix."}

{"text":"\nWe propose a new theory of the origin of conscious perception of oriented information, such as knowing \"which way is up.\" We show that such perception is not derived from the statistically optimal computation of orientation selectivity in downstream neurons, as has been widely assumed. Rather, it arises from an explicit, symmetric dependence on the neural response tobidirectional stimulation in the feedforward pathway. This makes conscious perception of orientation highly resilient to fluctuations in the statistics of the input, and endows it with a high degree of generalization ability. We further show that such a symmetric dependence on bidirectional stimulation cannot be captured by asymmetrically tuned neurons, and can only be accounted for by neurons with symmetric responses to bilateral stimulation, or by a combination of symmetric and asymmetric responses in a specific manner. We analyze a number of candidate neural mechanisms that may give rise to such symmetric responses, and propose a particular mechanism which is consistent with a large body of experimental evidence. We show that this mechanism is capable of producing orientation perception that is resilient to input noise and has a high degree of generalization ability, in a manner consistent with the Born rule. We propose that this mechanism plays a role in a number of perceptual tasks that require conscious detection of oriented information, including orientation discrimination, and explain why orientation perception is generally so resilient to input noise and has such a high degree of generalization ability."}
{"text":"\nWe introduce new integral representations of Whittaker functions for classical Lie groups which generalize the integral representations for the symmetric and antisymmetric parts of the Whittaker function on the space of invertible elements of the Lie algebra of a classical Lie group. The method of construction of these representations is based on the use of the Maass forms of the Lie algebra of the given Lie group. The proposed integral representations have been derived for the special case of the symmetric and antisymmetric parts of the Whittaker function on the space of invertible elements of the Lie algebra of a classical Lie group. However, they can be easily extended to the general case of the symmetric and antisymmetric parts of the Whittaker function on the space of all elements of the Lie algebra of a classical Lie group.

{"text":"\nWe have performed a first-order Fermi analysis of exclusive photoproduction of $J\/\\psi$ in proton-proton and proton-antiproton collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=200$ GeV. The data used in the analysis were collected with the BaBar detector at the PEP-II $e^+e^-$ accelerator. The analysis method involves fitting the longitudinal momentum distribution of $J\/\\psi$ to the data in a least-squares sense. The fitting procedure is constrained by requiring that the total number of $J\/\\psi$ produced in the collision is conserved. The result of the analysis is a plot of the cross section as a function of the longitudinal momentum transfer, $\\Delta\\vec p$, for the exclusive production of $J\/\\psi$ in the collision. We find that the cross section exhibits a very sharp peak at $\\Delta\\vec p\\sim 1\\, \\mathrm{GeV}^2$ and that the cross section falls off very rapidly as $\\Delta\\vec p$ increases or decreases from this value. This feature is in reasonable agreement with the theoretical prediction that the cross section should have a Delta function form with a half-width of a few GeV$^2$. The small number of events in the actual data set makes it difficult to extract the half-width with a high level of statistical significance, but we estimate it to be $\\sim 4\\, \\mathrm{GeV}^2$. The shape of the cross section as a function of $\\Delta\\vec p$ is consistent with the hypothesis that the exclusive production of $J\/\\psi$ in the proton-antiproton collision is due to the annihilation of a photon with an antiproton to produce a $J\/\\psi$-antijison pair and that the exclusive production of $J\/\\psi$ in the proton-proton collision is due to the subsequent collision of this $J\/\\psi$-antijison pair with a proton to produce two $J\/\\psi$ singlet pairs. We discuss the implications of our results for theoretical models of exclusive photoproduction and for the extraction of the $J\/\\psi$-antijison coupling constant from experimental data."}

We find a total of 93 globular clusters in Leo II, including eight satellites in a 3:2 mean-motion resonance with the giant planet system of Levaiethat were not previously known. We determine the spatial distribution of these clusters and compare their properties with those of globular clusters in the Milky Way and in the nearby Galactic globular cluster system. The clusters in Leo II show a wide range of metallicities, from [Fe\/H] \u2248 -1.0 to +0.5, but their distribution is not uniform, with a significant preference for the more metal-poor clusters to lie in the inner part of the system, within 15\u201320 kpc from the Leo II core. The clusters have a mean radius of 3.5 pc, a mean number of members of \u223c103, and a total mass of \u223c105 M\u2299. We show that the clusters have a different color distribution than field stars, with a significant fraction of blue stars, which suggests that the clusters are still gas-rich. We estimate the age of the clusters to be >10 Gyr, and we discuss the problem of dynamical friction in the cluster system. Our results suggest that the clusters have not experienced a strong dynamic interaction in the recent past. We also present new data on the chemical and spatial distribution of the field stars in the region around Leo II. We find that the stars in the region have a different spatial and color distribution than the clusters, with a significant preference for the blue stars to lie in the outer parts of the system, beyond 20 kpc from the Leo II core. We discuss the properties of the field stars and the clusters in the context of various formation scenarios for the globular cluster system."}

{"text":"\nWe investigate the emission of prompt gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) due to high-energy protons, muons and electron-positron pairs produced by intense laser-matter interactions. The motivation for this work is to explore the possibility of using high-energy lasers to produce intense beams of GRBs for use in various applications such as particle detectors and radiolabeling devices. Our key idea is to use a combination of particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation and stochastic optimization to design laser-matter interactions that produce the highest number of GRBs with the highest energy. Our methodology is to first use PIC simulation to model the laser-matter interaction, followed by the use of stochastic optimization to determine the optimal set of parameters that maximize the emission of GRBs. We obtained several interesting results. First, we found that the emission of GRBs due to high-energy protons and muons is relatively inefficient, with the number of GRBs per unit energy being orders of magnitude smaller than that due to high-energy electrons and positrons. Second, we found that the optimal set of parameters for producing the highest number of GRBs depends sensitively on the choice of GRB detector, with the optimal set of parameters being significantly different for various types of detectors. Finally, we found that the energy of the produced GRBs increases exponentially with the energy of the driving laser, with the peak energy of the GRBs being in the GeV to TeV range. Our work attempts to solve the problem of designing the optimal laser-matter interaction for producing the highest number of GRBs with the highest energy. Our findings have implications for future research in the area of high-energy lasers and their applications in various fields such as particle detectors and radiolabeling devices."}
{"text":"\n\nGlobal and regional brain metabolic scaling and its functional consequences\n\nMetabolic scaling describes the variation of metabolic rates across organisms of different sizes. All else equal, larger organisms tend to have higher metabolic rates, a feature that is typically explained by the surface area to volume ratio, which determines the rates of diffusion and excretion. However, the brain is unique among mammalian organs in that it displays economies of scale, such that metabolic rates decrease with increasing size. Here, we examined the functional consequences of global and regional brain metabolic scaling in the mouse. We found that the sharp decline in local brain metabolic rates with size was due to a decrease in the density of synaptic connections, which decreased the need for local processing power. However, the global metabolic rate, which reflects the need for long-range communication, was independent of brain size. We also found that the metabolic rate of a given area was the best predictor of the extent to which that area was specialized for a specific function, such as the primary motor cortex. Together, our findings suggest that brain metabolic scaling reflects both the need for local processing and long-range communication, and that these constraints are organized in a functionally relevant manner."}
{"text":"\nWe consider a one-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic model with self-consistently generated mean flow and a superposed turbulent velocity field. We derive a system of nonlinear partial differential equations for the statistical quantities of the model which is shown to be capable of describing several basic hydrodynamic and gyrokinetic phenomena in a statistically steady state regime. After an appropriate regularization, the problem is shown to have a unique solution which is related to the solution of the Navier-Stokes equations with a small but constant temperature gradient and a linear, inviscid, temperature dependent term describing the action of the Coriolis force. We evaluate the Coriolis force spectrum and show that it is related to the power spectrum of the velocity field. Our model is capable of describing various physical situations, such as a pure laminar flow, a flow with a constant mean velocity and a linear temperature gradient, a flow with a constant mean velocity and a parabolic temperature gradient, a flow with a variable mean velocity and a linear temperature gradient, and a turbulent flow.

{"text":"\n\nWe consider the weak and charge dark matter candidates motivated by the Stueckelberg extension of the standard model. We show that the standard Stueckelberg mechanism which gives rise to the non-standard weak and charge Yukawa matrices does not yield the correct dark matter masses for these two candidates. We then consider a generalisation of the Stueckelberg mechanism to a non-standard weak and charge Higgs sector which allows us to generate the correct dark matter masses. This generalised Stueckelberg mechanism is shown to be a viable mechanism to generate the correct weak and charge dark matter masses, and it is motivated by the requirements that the dark matter should have no direct coloured Yukawa coupling to the standard model fermions, and that the Higgs sector is extremely small. This generalised Stueckelberg mechanism also provides a possible explanation for the smallness of the Higgs sector and the smallness of the weak and charge Yukawa couplings. We consider an extension of this mechanism which allows one to generate a completely colour-flavor locked Higgs sector, and show that this extended mechanism still generates the correct weak and charge dark matter masses. We also show that this extended mechanism does not generate any new Standard Model like Higgs sector, and is consistent with the Standard Model expectation that the Higgs sector should be completely flavor locked."}
{"text":"\nWe present XMM-Newton observations of the eclipsing polar V2301 Oph. We find that the accretion phase lasts for about 45 ks, during which the donor star is hidden behind the accretion disc. The observed phenomenology is consistent with a smoothly increasing flux and a disc with a thickness of about 10 Rs. The ionisation structure is very similar to that found in V838 Mon, with a large fraction (70%) of ionised gas at a few Rs from the secondary, and a hint of a second ionisation peak at about 10 Rs. We have found a small non-linear feature in the accretion disc, at a radius of about 2 Rs, which could be due to the formation of a mini-disc. We discuss the relevance of this feature to the evolution of the system. We find that the accretion disc is slightly warped, preferentially ionised on the west side, and with a warp to the east. The warp may be the result of the influence of the large planet discovered recently in the system. The observed phenomenology is consistent with a donor star with a mass of about 1 M\u2299 and an accretion disc with a mass of about 0.3 M\u2299. We find that the accretion rate is \u029c_(ac) = 6.7 \u00d7 10^( \u2212 8) M_(\u2299) yr^( \u2212 1). The mass transfer rate is \u029c_(mt) = 1.4 \u00d7 10^( \u2212 8) M_(\u2299) yr^( \u2212 1).

The observations consist of 23 galaxies in the Local Volume Experiment (LVE) and four clouds in the Orion region: the rho Ophiuchi main cloud, the Orion molecular cloud, the Running Man Nebula, and the Cartwheel Nebula. We find that the core mass function in the rho Ophiuchi main cloud follows the Salpeter function with a core mass of $1-3M_{\\odot}$ and a Salpeter parameter $\\alpha_{\\rm{core}}\\sim 2.5$, while the core mass function in the Orion region follows the Kruckenberg function with a core mass of $0.2-1M_{\\odot}$ and a Salpeter parameter $\\alpha_{\\rm{core}}\\sim 1.5$. This implies that the rho Ophiuchi main cloud has a lower mass than the Orion region, which is in agreement with other independent observations. We also find that the temperatures in the cores are correlated with the local metallicity, with the cores in the Galactic plane (Z=0.001-0.02) being on average warmer than the cores in the extragalactic clouds (Z=0.0001-0.001)."}

We also show that the properties of the photometric and spectroscopic variations are consistent with the effect of a gravitational bound planetary system in which the mass of the primary is two to three times the mass of the secondary. The observations also reveal a 9.28-day cycle in the photometry and a 9.0-day cycle in the spectroscopy. We interpret these as the harmonics of the fundamental 3.67-day period. The amplitude of the harmonics is about one-half that of the primary signal, indicating that the mass of the secondary is between one-half and one-third that of the primary. We also show that a 12.5-day cycle is present in the photometry, but absent in the spectroscopy. The amplitude of this cycle is about one-third that of the primary signal, indicating that the mass of a third body, possibly a giant planet, is between one-third and one-half that of the primary.

{"text":"\n\nWe present the results of a H.E.S.S. observation of the distant blazar 1ES 1101-232 performed in August 2002. We find a level of VHE gamma-ray emission similar to that observed previously in 1997, confirming the extragalactic nature of the source. The observed phenomenology is consistent with a blazar model in which the bulk of the gamma-ray emission arises from a hotspot at the inner edge of a broad cake-layer structure. We determine the blaze angle to be 38 deg and find a lower limit on the extent of the cake layer of 70 deg. We discuss a simple model in which the energy distribution of the gamma-ray emission can be described by a single power law with a photon index of 1.6 and a peak energy of 400 GeV. The observed distribution is well described by such a model if the attenuation of gamma rays with energy is due to a combination of bulk and interlayer absorption. We estimate the absorbing thickness of the cake layer to be 1.5 kpc and the bulk volume density to be $1.4\\, \\mathrm{Ge}^{-2}$ cm$^{-3}$, consistent with the bulk density of the intergalactic medium.

{"text":"\nWe present observations of the HC3N(1-0) line in the face-on spiral galaxy NGC 4418, made with the SOFIN high-resolution spectrograph on the Nordic Optical Telescope. The observations reveal a largescale (50 kpc) eastern extension of the HC3N(1-0) line emission in the outer parts of the galaxy, coinciding with the location of the radio source DR2, and the eastern half of the X-ray source 1W3X1. The kinematics of the HC3N(1-0) line in this eastern region is complex, with several components moving at different velocities. The main part of the line is moving at 86 km s$^{-1}$, with a velocity that is higher than the systemic velocity of NGC 4418 (75 km s$^{-1}$), consistent with the HC3N(1-0) line being excited by an AGN hidden by the disk of the galaxy. The velocity of the HC3N(1-0) line in the western half of the galaxy is much lower (60 km s$^{-1}$), and does not show any velocity offset with respect to the systemic velocity. We suggest that the low-velocity component in the western half is related to the formation of stars in the galactic disk, whereas the high-velocity component in the eastern half is related to the activity of an AGN hidden by the disk. The observed properties of the HC3N(1-0) line are consistent with a model in which the line is excited by a hidden AGN, and then distorted by the galactic disk, with the relative strengths of the high- and low-velocity components being governed by the ratio of the optical depth due to the hidden AGN to the optical depth due to the galactic disk."}
{"text":"\nWe study the hydrodynamics of a non-Abelian (specifically, non-Abelian scarred) Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) in a circularly symmetric trap. The dynamics of such a condensate is governed by the relativistic (or Lorentzian) hydrodynamics equations.

We show that these vortices can be treated statistically, and we derive a statistical equation for the density of un quantized vortices. This statistical approach provides exact results that can be used to find the total number of un quantized vortices, their mean and variance, and the probability distribution of their orientations. We also derive a general equation for the mean flow velocity, which takes into account the contribution from un quantized vortices. We find that this equation reduces to the standard hydrodynamic equation for a relativistic BEC in the limit when the number of un quantized vortices is small. We discuss the implications of our results for a recent proposal for using hydrodynamic vortices to encode information in a spin-orbit coupled substance."}

We use the mass of the lightest neutral hadron as a marker for the produced top quark. The search strategy is based on the analysis of events with one or two leptons, and on the distribution of the hadron masses in the events with two leptons. We observe 2 events with a hadron mass greater than the expected background, and 1 event with a hadron mass in the expected background range. We observe no significant excess over the expected background. We set cross section limits in a range of center-of-mass energy assuming the standard model production mechanism.

We then classify certain special representations, which we call type I representations, in terms of this classification. We show that the type I representations are precisely the representations that can be obtained by starting with a representation that is an irreducible representation of a simple group and then repeatedly taking the scalar part and reducing. We then show that this classification is functorial for any morphism of semisimple groups, in particular for the inclusion of a subgroup. We show further that the functor is essentially the restriction to a subgroup with respect to the adjoint representation. We deduce from this that any representation of a semisimple group that is equivalent to the adjoint representation is of type I. We show that the same is true for any representation that is equivalent to the restriction to a maximal parabolic subgroup. As an application of our main result, we deduce that certain types of representations of quantum simple groups are unitarizable."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a physical model of bar formation in galaxies that accounts for the observed relationship between the bar and the spiral arms. Our model is based on the idea that the bar is a density wave that excites the spiral arms as it passes through the disk of the galaxy.

We have tested the model using a numerical code that includes a mass source at the bar-core, and we find that the model produces good agreement with observations on the timescales relevant for bar evolution. We also show that bars can naturally form in galaxies that initially lack spiral arms, provided that the bar-forming mechanism is sufficiently violent. This produces a reasonable explanation for the observation that some barred galaxies have no spiral arms, while spiral galaxies can develop bars as well. We discuss a number of tests of our model that can be made using observations, and we also consider the implications of bar-formation on galactic dynamics."}

{"text":"\n\nWe present photometric and structural measurements of the disk around the young star IRS 48. Our observations resolve the disk into a series of rings, the gaps between which are marked by the locations of planetesimals. We find that the inner few gaps are approximately equally spaced, indicating that the planetesimals are roughly equal in size. The sizes of the planetesimals decrease outward, and the outermost planetesimals are much smaller than the inner planetesimals. The inner large planetesimals are spatially separated from the outer small planetesimals by a gap approximately 1.5 times the size of the inner planetesimals. We propose that the disk has a transition region between the inner and outer planetesimal belts. In this region, planetesimals grow by colliding with each other and fragmenting, until they are large enough to be stable against further fragmentation. We model the evolution of the disk and find that the predicted grain size distribution is in good agreement with the observed distribution, if the disk contains a transition region between the inner and outer planetesimal belts. Our results suggest that the grain size distribution in planetesimal belts is determined by the planetesimals' growth history, and that a continuous range of grain sizes is not produced by the collisional fragmentation of planetesimals."}

This allows us to study the structure of the fields in the representation space. We show that the vacuum is an accidental symmetry of the model, and that the associated unbroken symmetry is a three-row representation (i.e., a representation of $\\mathfrak{sl}_3$) with three $SU(2)_R$ operators and one $SU(2)_L$ operator. We consider a model in which the three $SU(2)_R$ operators are in the fundamental representation of $\\mathfrak{sl}_2$, while the $SU(2)_L$ operator is in the adjoint representation of $\\mathfrak{sl}_2$. We find that this model can have an accidental symmetry with the three $SU(2)_R$ operators in the adjoint representation of $\\mathfrak{sl}_2$ and the $SU(2)_L$ operator in the fundamental representation of $\\mathfrak{sl}_2$. The spontaneous breaking of the accidental symmetry in this model results in the generation of a three-row representation (the adjoint representation of $\\mathfrak{sl}_2$) of the hidden symmetry $\\mathfrak{sl}_3$. We show that the vacuum symmetry breaking generates an electroweak symmetry breaking term with two rows in the adjoint representation of $\\mathfrak{sl}_2$.

We estimate that several thousand such sources must exist in the local volume, but they are extremely faint and hard to detect. We found the first indication of these sources in the XMM-Newton data by searching for point sources that were not detected in archival data from the 2 Micron All Sky Survey but that have a high probability of being an X-ray source (based on their optical and N-band data). Follow-up spectroscopy with the UV-optical suite on Hubble and with the DEIMOS multiobject spectrograph on KeckII confirmed that a large fraction of these sources are indeed AGN, with mid-IR colors and X-ray spectra consistent with accreting supermassive black holes. These AGN are estimated to have accretion rates of 10^(\u22121) to 10^(+3) times the accretion rate of the supermassive black hole in our own galaxy, and they are faint because they are both distant and young. We determine the masses of the host galaxies and the supermassive black holes in these galaxies, and find that a significant fraction ( approximately 50%) of these black holes are in the range 10^4 to 10^7 solar masses. These black holes are an order of magnitude less massive than the black holes in galaxies that were previously known to host an AGN, indicating that the low-mass end of the distribution of supermassive black holes is preserved in galaxies that host an AGN.

{"text":"\nWe study the influence of the stiffness of the interparticle interactions on the viscoelasticity of hard-disk and Lennard-Jones cluster glasses, in terms of the Stokes-Einstein relation. We find that the characteristic relaxation time, defined as the time required for the glass to relax to an equilibrium state, increases exponentially as a function of the repulsive or attractive interparticle interaction strength, in disagreement with the predictions of the Stokes-Einstein relation, which holds that the relaxation time is proportional to the inverse square of the interaction strength. Our results suggest that, in contrast to the case of amorphous materials, the glass transition temperature Tg does not correspond to a crossover temperature at which the network connectivity changes from being dominated by local to long-range forces, but rather to a temperature at which the relative importance of the two types of forces is similar. We also discuss a simple model which can explain our experimental results, in terms of the competition between local and long-range forces."}
{"text":"\nWe have investigated the spin-dependent transport in a ferromagnetic (FM) semiconductor (Bi0.5Fe0.5)0.9Te0.1) with a room temperature (RT) spin-orbital-liquid (SOL) order, in an effort to understand the mechanism of the spin-mediated transport in such materials, and to explore its potential for spintronic applications. We have found that the spin-diffusion length (L) in this material is much shorter than the previously reported L values in non-magnetic semiconductors, which is consistent with the notion that the spin-mediated transport in magnetic semiconductors is inherently different from the ordinary charge-mediated transport. We have also found that the room temperature L value in this material is large enough (6.5 \u03bcm) to be potentially useful for spintronic applications. We have further found that the low temperature (T< 100 K) behavior of the spin-induced magnetoresistance (MR) is consistent with the standard Boltzmann transport model, but the RT behavior of the MR is different from the behavior predicted by this model. We have explained this discrepancy by a model in which the RT MR is dominated by the re-population of the mobile carriers at the Fermi level after their spin-dependent diffusion. We have also found that the MR is sensitive to an external magnetic field even in the absence of any spin-polarization of the injected carriers, which is consistent with the notion that the MR in magnetic semiconductors is due to the spin-dependent scattering of the carriers by the internal spin-ordsal moment, and is therefore different from the MR in magnetic metals, in which the MR is due to the spin-dependent scattering of the spin-polarized carriers by the internal spin-orbit moment. Finally, we have found that the temperature dependence of the MR in this material is consistent with the model in which the RT MR is dominated by the re-population of the mobile carriers at the Fermi level after their spin-dependent diffusion."}
{"text":"\nWe study the non-relativistic limit of the Einstein equation. In the early years of general relativity it was realized that the solution of the Einstein equation in the limit in which the speed of light is infinite is equivalent to Newton's theory of gravity. A similar limit was derived bycosts of a finite speed of light and was studied in the framework of Einstein's theory. The non-relativistic limit of the Einstein equation was recently studied again, in the framework of the so-called post-Einstein general relativity. In this approach the Einstein equation is replaced by a modified equation, derived by a proper transformation of the Einstein equation. In the framework of this approach, a clear physical meaning can be assigned to the non-relativistic limit. In this limit the metric tensor is symmetric and the spacetime is flat. Therefore we obtain a theory similar to Newton's theory of gravity, with a curvature vanishing everywhere. Our work tries to clarify the situation in this limit, by showing that in the framework of the post-Einstein approach the Einstein equation is recovered exactly in this limit. We show also that the post-Einstein approach can be seen as a generalization of the Einstein equation to a more general theory, in which the gravitational field can be curved even in the absence of matter. Therefore the non-relativistic limit of the Einstein equation can be seen as a particular case of the post-Einstein theory."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present observations of maser lines in the nuclear regions of three galaxies, obtained with the Nordic Optical Telescope. The maser lines arise from the nuclear disk, a dynamically stable reservoir of gas and dust rotating around the supermassive black hole. We find that the maser lines in the nuclear disk are very narrow, indicating that the gas is much colder than the gas in the inner part of the accretion disk, which is at a few thousand degrees. We conclude that the gas in the nuclear disk is at the temperature where the individual gas molecules have their transition to a lower vibrational state, typically a few tens of degrees. We discuss the nature of the molecular gas in the nuclear disk, in particular the low abundance of carbon-containing molecules, and the strong signature of the intricate molecular structure of the gas. We show that the observations are consistent with a model where the gas is heated by the infalling matter, but is kept cool by efficient mixing and a large scale structure that act as a thermostat. The low gas density and the large temperature fluctuations in the accretion flow may be responsible for the efficient mixing, while the large scale structure is probably due to the orbits of large masses, with sizes of order of the size of the accretion disk. We find that the gas is in a state close to chemical equilibrium, in spite of the very low gas density, which implies a large number of chemical reactions. We discuss the physical origin of the mers in the light of these results, and we find that the masers are likely to be due to a chemical equilibrium, possibly with a small fraction of unstable molecules that can lead to a maser effect."}
{"text":"\nWe propose a new method to search for galactic cosmic ray (GCR) sources capable of producing multi-TeV gamma rays and neutrinos. We target a small number of candidate sources in our galaxy, which are capable of producing the observed high energy cosmic ray flux, and are constrained in their origin to the galactic plane. The method combines data from the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, the Gamma-Ray Astronomy at TeV Energy (GREAT) experiment, and the Milagro detector. We find that, if any of these sources were to produce neutrinos at the IceCube detection level, they would also produce an excess of TeV gamma rays that would be detectable with the current GREAT exposure. Thus, a search for neutrino sources with IceCube and a search for TeV gamma rays with GREAT can be combined to search for such GCR sources, provided that (i) the neutrino flux from the source is at least two orders of magnitude larger than the current background, and (ii) the gamma ray flux from the source is at most a factor of three larger than the current background. We conclude that none of the proposed sources is likely to be detected with the current IceCube exposure, except for the Sagittarius stream, which could be detectable if it were to produce gamma rays at the level of the Tevatron. We discuss the implications of our method for the prospects of detecting GCR sources with high energy neutrinos and gamma rays."}
{"text":"\nWe consider a scenario where an axion condensate is present in the early Universe and the axion fluid is able to sustain a significant vortex structure that collapses in the later Universe to form a dark matter halo. We show that the energy density of this vortex has the right scale to become a dark matter halo with the same energy density as the one observed in the Universe. We find that the growth of the vortex is governed by the mass flux through the vortex core, which in our case is driven by the anisotropic pressure. Therefore, our scenario can provide a physical explanation for the velocity distribution function of dark matter particles, which is consistent with the data from large scale structure formation. The core of the vortex is able to sustain a significant amount of mass, because the mass flow is driven by the pressure gradient and the structure is able to keep itself stable by the positive feedback from the gravitational attraction. We show that the outer regions of the halo contain much less mass, and the profile is able to fit the observations."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present here a study of the galaxy stellar mass assembly history over the last 8 Gyr, based on the VIMOS VLT Deep Survey (VVDS). We show that the stellar mass function (SMF) of galaxies in the VVDS is well described by a power law with a mild cut-off at Mpc-1. This result suggests that the mass assembly of galaxies is a gentle process and that the probability of accreting mass decreases smoothly with galaxy radius. We find that the mass assembly history is well described by a two-turbulence model in which the inner few kpc of galaxies evolve turbulence-free, while the outer regions are affected by a second, longer lived, turbulence with a different power law index. We show that this model is in good agreement with the observations, provided that the cut-off in the SMF occurs at a radius where the second turbulence begins to affect the stellar mass assembly. We discuss several implications of our results. In particular, we show that the model predicts that the stellar mass density of galaxies is a smooth function of radius, with no indication of a cored density profile."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a study of the dust and gas around the star beta Pictoris, the closest star to which a giant planet has been detected. We have used a combination of archival data from the Hubble Space Telescope and new data from the Subaru Telescope to study the gas and dust in the region. The new data comprises the largest set of high-resolution images of the region ever taken. We have detected nine new dusty objects in the beta Pictoris system, bringing the total number of known dust sources to 23. The new objects are between 3 and 13 million kilometers from the star, and they show a range of spatial structures, including a tail-like feature and several point sources. We have also detected a new gas cloud, bringing the total number of known gas clouds in the system to four. The gas clouds are between 2 and 5 billion kilometers from the star, and they are the coldest gas clouds detected in the system so far. We have determined the orbital elements of the giant planet beta Pictoris b relative to the other planets in the system, and we find that it is a \"warm Jupiter,\" with a temperature similar to that of the Sun. The new data also reveal that the beta Pictoris system is more complex than previously thought, with at least one more planet in the system and many more dusty and gas sources."}
{"text":"\n\nSpectral efficiency of spectrum pooling systems\n\nThe explosive growth of wireless services has led to a severe shortage of spectrum in the frequency bands where most of these services operate. A promising solution to this problem is to employ spectrum pooling, where a wide bandwidth is obtained by simultaneously using multiple narrowband frequency segments that are not fully utilized. In this work, we propose a novel algorithm for improving the spectral efficiency of spectrum pooling systems. Our approach is based on the combination of two techniques: an inter-band scheduling technique that exploits the statistical dependence between the narrowband channels, and a intra-band scheduling technique that exploits the statistical dependence within each narrowband channel. We show that by optimally combining these two techniques, the spectral efficiency of the system can be significantly improved. Our analysis also shows that the performance of the proposed algorithm is close to the optimal performance, and is not affected by the parameter settings of the system. simulation results."}
{"text":"\n\nStretching Homopolymers\n\nWe report a detailed experimental and theoretical study of the steady-state and transient stretching of homopolymers. A variety of experimental methods were used to monitor the transient deformation and the steady-state properties of stretched fibers. We found the transient and steady-state behaviors to be in good agreement, except for the elastic modulus, which increases transiently and then decreases in the steady state. The theoretical description of the transient behavior is based on a dynamic relaxation model with a distributed relaxation time. The agreement between theory and experiment is good for a wide range of polymers, despite the fact that the theory makes several assumptions that are not satisfied in general, such as an ideal rubbery fiber and a one-dimensional transient deformation. We found the transient and steady-state stretchings to be well described by a two-stage model in which the first stage is a fast, nearly ideal rubbery deformation and the second is a slow, quasi-steady-state deformation with an elastic modulus that decreases with deformation."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider the problem of fitting algebraic curves to a set of points in the complex plane. We show that such fittings can be accomplished by using the Ramanujan zeta function $\\zeta(z)$ with its argument held fixed at the roots of $\\zeta(z)$, and that in this way a generalization of the well-known Riemann Hypothesis can be obtained. We show that the fitting of algebraic curves to the first 100 points in the Zeta Population counts as well as the first 100 points in the Shafarevich-Tate curve provide a good estimation of the extended fractal dimension of the fitted curves. We give an approximation formula for the fitted curves and show that the relative error in the approximation can be bounded from above by the base of the natural logarithm. We show that the problem of minimizing the least-square error in the approximation formula has a simple solution. We show that the problem of finding the fractal dimension of the fitted curves by using the solution to the least-square error has a simple solution as well."}
{"text":"\nWe consider two-photon transitions in hydrogen and their role in the cosmological recombination history of the Universe. Two-photon transitions in hydrogen are uniquely determined by the fine structure constant, the proton-to-electron mass ratio, and the Dirac constant of the electron. We show that in the presence of a strong magnetic field, two-photon transitions in hydrogen are completely suppressed, in agreement with the observation that the cosmic microwave background does not show any signature of magnetic fields stronger than a few micro-gauss. This result suggests that any attempt to explain the origin of magnetic fields by mechanisms acting on hydrogen alone are likely to be unsuccessful. We also show that two-photon transitions in hydrogen can have a significant effect on the recombination history of the Universe, but only if the electron-to-photon ratio is extremely large. In this case, two-photon transitions can either completely suppress or accelerate recombination, depending on the strength of the magnetic field."}
{"text":"\n\nMassive planet migration: Theoretical predictions and comparison with observations\n\nWe present a semi-quantitative theory of massive planet migration within the habitable zones of\ufffd their host stars. We derive a simple expression for the drift velocity of a giant planet, in terms of the ratio of the planet to host star mass, and the orbital period. The theory makes a number of assumptions, including a dictate that the planet and star masses are comparable. In this way the theory is a derivation of the \" migrate-and-spin-up\" mechanism first proposed by Thatte and 1999. We show that, within the framework of our assumptions, massive planet migration is a rapid process, on a timescale of about a million years. We also show that the drift velocity increases sharply as the orbital period decreases, which has important implications for the process of planetary system formation. The theory is compared with available observations, and we show that the observations are consistent with our theory."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a study of the ATLAS search for a violation of the Wtb unordered flavor symmetry in top quark decays. We consider events with two jets and two missing transverse energy, where one of the jets is identified as a top quark candidate, in the final state. We evaluate the sensitivity of the analysis to a permanent Wtb flavor violation and to a transient Wtb flavor violation. For the permanent case we use the latest ATLAS cross section predictions, and we evaluate the expected number of events in the full 2011 LHC data set, in the 9\u00a0fb\u22121 Run 1 data, and in a future Run 2 data set with the full LHC luminosity. For the transient case we evaluate the sensitivity to a single top quark decay with a lifetime of 1 ns, and to a single top quark decay with a lifetime of 10 ns. The expected number of events in the full 2011 LHC data set, in the 9\u00a0fb\u22121 Run 1 data, and in a future Run 2 data set with the full LHC luminosity is also evaluated. We find that the full LHC data set can yield a clear indication of a permanent Wtb flavor violation, if the underlying theory is able to produce a coupling to the top quark of the order of 1%. A transient Wtb flavor violation can be probed with a single top quark lifetime of \u00a010 ns."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a detailed analysis of the robustness of the constraints on cosmology and galaxy evolution that can be obtained from the lens-redshift test. We consider the case of a flat lambda cold dark matter (LCDM) cosmology with a linear power law bias, and show that the constraints on the evolution of the matter power spectrum, the matter abundance, and the growth rate of structure are much stronger than previously thought. We show that the current constraints already exclude a cut-off scale of matter power spectrum that is smaller than the one expected from a LCDM cosmology with a massive early universe, and place a tight constraint on the evolution of the matter power spectrum. We also show that the constraints on the evolution of the matter abundance are as strong as the ones from the distance-redshift test, even if the lens-redshift test is less sensitive to a departure from a perfect relativistic cosmology. We also find that the growth rate of structure is robustly constrained to be positive, even when a negative power law bias is allowed for the lensing effect. Finally, we consider a model in which the matter power spectrum is allowed to evolve with a non-trivial probability distribution function, and find that the lens-redshift test is able to constrain its evolution if the evolution is fast enough. We show that the combination of the lens-redshift test and the distance-redshift test places a tight constraint on the evolution of the matter power spectrum. We also show that this combination places a constraint on the evolution of the matter abundance that is slightly stronger than the one from the distance-redshift test."}
{"text":"\nWe present new models of the chemical enrichment of the ISM in the first supernova (SN) explosions. Our chemical models include a detailed treatment of the chemical enrichment of the ISM by a supernova (SN) and account for the metal-poor initial conditions, chemical mixing, and chemical feedback from the SN. We find that the chemical mixing is inefficient in the presence of the SN because the metal-poor gas remains on the outside of the SN bubble, while the enriched gas remains in the interior. We show that the chemical enrichment by a SN depends sensitively on the details of the SN energy budget, and thus on the adopted SN model. We discuss in detail the effects of the SN feedback on the chemical evolution of the ISM. We show that inefficiency of the chemical mixing and the SN feedback can produce an extremely chemically enhanced gas in the interior of the SN bubble, while the gas in the outer region remains almost unaltered. We discuss the chemical enrichment in the context of observations, in particular, in the context of the chemically enhanced gas in SN 1987A. We also discuss the SN chemical enrichment in the context of the chemical evolution of the Galaxy and show that the adopted model for the SN feedback has important implications for the chemical evolution of the Galactic disk and halo."}
{"text":"\nWe continue our study of the structure of the homunculus, the tissue- inked three-dimensional portrait of the person, as it is being formed in a rotating surface explosion. In the last paper, we saw that the core of the homunculus is a disk of nervous tissue, with the contralateral pairs of sense organs arranged in a ring around it. We found that the surface of the disk is covered with a layer of neural tissue that is continuous with the neural tissue of the sense organs. In this paper, we investigate the structure of this neural tissue. We show that it is a bipolar epithelium, with the nerve fibers and the glial cells lying in the conduits between the two layers of epithelial cells. We also show that the epithelial cells are very close to the disk surface, and that the glial cells are very close to the sense organs. These two layers of cells are separated from each other by a layer of extracellular material that is very dense in glial cells. Thus, the homunculus is not just a surface reflection of the underlying disk, but has its own internal structure as well."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a census of the ionization structure of the Carina Nebula, a dense, gas-rich, and relatively nearby star-forming region. We have derived the relative ionization structure from a comparison of optical and near-infrared extinction maps of the region obtained with the Multiband Imaging Photometer for Spitzer (MIPS). The comparison of the two maps allows a determination of the relative ionization contribution from different ionizing sources. We find that the largest contribution (about 65%) to the ionization structure comes from a cluster of young stars in the north-west corner of the Carina Nebula. The ionization from this cluster is nearly universal in the western part of the nebula, but its influence decreases toward the east. We also find that the ionization is correlated with the distribution of molecular hydrogen, with the exception of a large, round, and nearly ion-free hole in the north-east part of the nebula. We discuss several possible explanations for the origin of this hole, including the possibility that it is a truly ion-free region, possibly resulting from the outflow from the Carina Throne. We also find that the ionization is generally low (log(O\/H) < 1.5), except for a number of small-scale features where it is much higher. We discuss the origin of these features as well as the possibility that the small-scale structures might be important for the formation of the complex morphology of the Carina Nebula."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a model of the equatorial rings observed in many bipolar nebulae. Our model consists of an axisymmetric dark cloud with a hole in the middle, the boundary between the molecular and ionized gas. We solve the radiative transfer in this model in the frequency domain and in the presence of the self-absorption. We show that the equatorial rings are a natural outcome of this solution, provided that the cloud's inner layer is more dense than its outer layer. We derive a simple expression for the radius of the equatorial rings in terms of the physical properties of the cloud. We show that this radius is in agreement with the observed values provided that the mass of the cloud is in the range 10^2\u201310^3 M\u2299, which corresponds to the mass of the gas in a Class 0 protostar. We discuss the properties of the equatorial rings in the context of our model and of the observational data. We also discuss the mechanism by which the equatorial rings are created. In our model the equatorial rings are created by a process of gravitational collapse in the cloud's inner layer. We show that the time needed for this process to produce the observed equatorial rings is on the order of the lifetime of a Class 0 protostar, provided that the cloud's inner layer is at least three times more dense than its outer layer."}

These quasars, with , are approximately five times more luminous than the quasars selected from the 2nd and 3rd magnitude bins. The quasars in our sample have luminosities almost ten times larger than the quasars from the 6th and 7th magnitude bins. We find that the X-ray luminosity functions (XLFs) of quasars in the 4th and 5th magnitude bins are well described by a power law with a linear intercept of 3.9 kpc^2 host- Galaxy luminosity. The XLFs of the quasars in the 6th and 7th magnitude bins are well described by a power law with a linear intercept of 1.1 kpc^2. The XLFs of the quasars in the 4th and 5th magnitude bins are, on average, 1.7 times higher than those in the 6th and 7th magnitude bins. We show that this difference can be explained by the difference in the observed XLFs of the host galaxies, if the quasars in the 4th and 5th magnitude bins are located, on average, 1.6 kpc closer to their host galaxies than the quasars in the 6th and 7th magnitude bins. We discuss this result in the context of the accretion histories of quasars and the hypothesis that quasars are accreting from a wind-driven accretion flow. We find that this simple model is consistent with the observed relationship between the XLF and the quasar-host galaxy separation. Our results suggest that the accretion histories of quasars are strongly dependent on the separation of the quasars to their host galaxies."}

{"text":"\n\nWe study the hierarchy of N=8 mechanics models, which describe systems of almost rigid bodies moving in three-dimensional space under the action of the bilateral forces acting along the ambient space directions.

This model can be made arbitrarily close to the most general N=8 mechanics model by taking the bending rigidities of the components of the system to be infinitely large. The most general N=8 mechanics model univocally determined by the properties of the system has the degrees of freedom, which are twice less than the number of the components of the system. The consideration of the simplest case of a system of two bodies, which interact with each other by a scalar force and move in three-dimensional space, leads to the appearance of the N=8 mechanics models, which describe the general behavior of systems of almost rigid bodies in the presence of bilateral forces acting along the ambient space directions."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present photometric observations of the binary companions to the luminous blue variables (LBVs) SN 1987A and SN 1967G. We show that these systems contain extremely close pairs of white dwarfs in wide (8\u20139 days) orbit around the blue dwarf. The mass of the blue dwarf is not much greater than the mass of the white dwarf in either system. Thus, these systems are not useful for studying the evolution of field LBVs. The close white dwarf pairs are unusual and of interest in their own right, however. We discuss the possibility that the evolution of these systems has been influenced by the exchange of material between the two stars, possibly leading to the white dwarf's acquiring a significant fraction of its current mass. The accretion history of the white dwarf is probably not unique, so this may provide a mechanism for the evolution of other field LBVs. The low-mass objects in these systems may be the first examples of objects in the so-called detached object category that has been proposed as a possible route to the evolution of type I supernovae.\n\nWe have discovered a new detached binary in the planetary nebula around SN 1987A.

We begin by discussing the basics of orbital dynamics in such systems, and the particular challenges they pose to detection and characterization. We then review the various observational methods that have been proposed or used to detect circumbinaries, including photometric, spectroscopic, and imaging techniques. We also discuss the particular challenges posed by the fact that circumbinaries are usually relatively close to their host stars, and thus are subject to strong gravitational perturbations. We then review the observational evidence for circumbinaries, and the methods used to detect and characterize them. We conclude by discussing the outstanding questions and challenges in this field, and the prospects for future progress."}

We show that our method is simple and provides immediate and direct information on the spatial resolution and on the simultaneous detection probability, without the need of additional analysis. Our method is suitable for both continuous and binary pixels detectors. We show that the spatial resolution obtained with our method is in good agreement with the theoretical resolution limit, for detectors with pixels spaced close to this limit.

We develop a simple and efficient method for reliably computing the power spectrum based on the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of the covariance matrix. We show that the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix can be computed by performing a spherical Fourier analysis of the data.

{"text":"\nWe investigate the effect of a longitudinal magnetic field on the frustrated J1-J2 model on the square lattice. The low-temperature properties of this model have been discussed in the framework of the broken-gap model. We show that a magnetic field applied along the frustrated direction has the same effect as a negative pressure, that is, it drives the system toward a non-degenerate state in which the gap is closed. We analyze the effect of a magnetic field applied along the non-frustrated direction and find a significant drop in the transition temperature, in agreement with the results obtained for the XY model on the square lattice. We also investigate the effect of a transverse magnetic field and show that in this case the system prefers to stay in a state with a large gap, in spite of the drop in the transition temperature. Our results are consistent with the idea that the system can be driven out of its frustrated state by a longitudinal magnetic field, but not by a transverse magnetic field."}
{"text":"\nWe extend the redshift-distance relation in cosmological general relativity to higher redshifts. In the framework of the reference-frame-attached approach, we show that the redshift-distance relation can be naturally expressed in terms of the time-ordered exponential expansion of space-time. We then show that the early-time behavior of this exponential expansion is well described by a power law with a negative power of the redshift. We evaluate the parameters of this power law by requiring that the redshift-distance relation be consistent with the observed correlation between redshift and distance at low redshift, and with the fact that the Universe is spatially flat at high redshift. We find that the best-fit power law has a negative power of -1.7. We show that this result is consistent with the assumption that the spatial curvature is positive, and remains positive for all redshifts. We also show that the best-fit power law is consistent with the assumption that the Universe has a single equation of state (EOS) parameterization, provided that this EOS is sufficiently close to the critical line between the concordial and anti-concordial regimes. Finally, we show that the early-time behavior of the exponential expansion of space-time can be well described by an overweighted sum of (a) a power law with a negative power of the redshift, and (b) a term that is proportional to the square of the redshift."}
{"text":"\n\nWe propose a new method for minimizing the distortion in Gaussian layered broadcast coding with successive refinement. Our method is based on a low-complexity successive-approximation-register (SAR) algorithm that is used to minimize the distortion of the entire sequence in one go. We show that this method results in a significant reduction of the mean-square error (MSE) compared to the scheme that refines the code word by word. Our scheme is applicable to both coherent and non-coherent transmission. Furthermore, the proposed method can be used in a multi-user scenario. In this case, the algorithm is used to minimize the distortion of the received signal of one user, while the code words of the other users are regarded as noise. We show that the proposed method is particularly beneficial if the initial guess is close to the desired code word. Finally, the proposed method can be easily extended to the case where the transmission channel is a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a new method to estimate the accretion rate of planetesimals onto growing protoplanets, based on the planetesimal orbits. The method is applicable to both face-on and edge-on orbits, and allows us to investigate the efficiency of planetesimal accretion onto protoplanets. We find that planetesimals are most efficiently accreted onto protoplanets in a specific range of orbital resonances. We show that in face-on orbits the 1:3 and 1:5 orbital resonances are the most efficient accretion resonances, while in edge-on orbits the most efficient accretion resonance is the 3:7 resonance. We also show that if planetesimals are not evenly distributed in these orbits, the efficiency of accretion can be significantly reduced. We discuss the effects of planetesimal orbit distribution and orbital migration on the efficiency of accretion. The method presented here can be used to investigate the evolution of the orbital distribution of planetesimals, as well as to estimate the mass accretion rate of protoplanets."}

We then focus on the dynamics of the systems, and the effects of the presence of a secondary body on the orbital evolution and planet formation in the primary. We discuss the different mechanisms that have been proposed to explain the large number of hot Jupiters that have been observed, and the possible role of the Kozai mechanism in the dynamical evolution of these systems.

{"text":"\n\nWe introduce a class of fluctuation theorems that generalize the Bastiaansen-Bargmann-Seierstedt theorem to the case of relativistic Brownian motion. Our approach is based on the rigorous derivation of a fluctuation inequality for the empirical measure of relativistic Brownian motion. The use of the Witten diagram allows us to give an explicit representation of the deviation from the standard form of the fluctuation theorem in terms of a small parameter that is related to the ratio of the signal frequency to the inverse of the finite lifetime of the oscillatory component. Within this framework we show that the fluctuation theorem can be understood as a generalization of the Bastiaansen-Bargmann-Seierstedt theorem in which the different terms in the fluctuation inequality have specific physical meanings. As an application we show that our fluctuation theorems can be used to prove the nonlinear cosmic variance which was recently proposed as a way to explain the puzzling non-Gaussian features of the cosmic microwave background."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a study of the chemical abundances of HII regions in M 33. Our sample consists of HII regions with metallicities that have been determined by a variety of independent methods.

We find that the metallicities increase towards the outer regions of M 33, in agreement with theoretical predictions of a cosmological chemical evolution model. The increase of the metallicity with radius is well described by a power law of index 1.9 \u00b1 0.1. We also present a comparison between the chemical abundances of HII regions in M 33 and in the Milky Way. In particular, we show that the metallicity of the HII regions in M 33 is, on average, higher than that of the Milky Way, but there is no significant difference in the proportion of elements heavier than iron. We discuss our results in the framework of chemical evolution models, and in particular of the massive-chain-processing model."}
{"text":"\n\nWe study higher order QCD corrections in exclusive charmless B decays and update our previous results for the charmed B meson. We consider decays with a hadron final state, where the hadron is a prompt fission neutron, and with a lepton final state, where the lepton is an invisible weak electron. We use the SOiet Sasakian quarkonia as the quarkonia for the meson and we evaluate the QCD corrections in the quarkonia approach. We find that the QCD corrections to the weak B-Bbar final state can give a significant increase in the invisible weak electron's contribution to the B decays and can make it more significant than the prompt fission neutron's contribution.\n\nWe also evaluate the QCD corrections to the charmed B meson in the quarkonia approach and compare the results with our previous calculation using the inclusive quarkonia approach. We find that the quarkonia approach with the SOiet Sasakian quarkonia can give a reasonable description of the QCD corrections to the charmed B meson for the charmless B decays with the hadron final state, although it cannot reproduce the correction to the weak final state due to the problem of the small quarkonia masses. We discuss the problem of the small quarkonia masses and consider the possibility of using the hybrid quarkonia to describe the QCD corrections to the charmed B meson in the charmless B decays."}
{"text":"\n\nWe have developed a theory of elastic and inelastic properties of solids which are confined in quasi one dimensional strips. We have considered a solid which is resting on a hard substrate and the interfacial traction force is negligible compared to the strength of the solid. Our theory is based on the assumption that the strain energy in the constrained solid is a function of the strain in the thickness direction, the bending moments in the strip, and the shear forces in the strip. We show that, as a result of the interplay between the stiffness of the solid and the constraint provided by the strip, the structural and mechanical properties of the solid in the strip can differ significantly from those of the bulk solid, and these properties can be engineered by suitable design of the strip. In particular, we show that, if the solid is elastic and the strip is wide enough, the solid will not experience any stress even when a large deformation is applied to the strip. On the other hand, if the solid is inelastic and the strip is narrow, the solid can experience stresses which can be higher than the bulk yield stress of the solid. We also discuss the effect of various geometrical parameters of the strip on the structural and mechanical properties of the solid in the strip. Our results can have practical implications in several areas of research including geotechnical and civil engineering, materials science and engineering, and bioengineering."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present an analysis of the frequency separation ratios (FSRs) of low-degree p modes for 78 F- and G-type stars in an effort to derive solar abundances of the heavy elements. The FSRs are computed using the public socialism database (SDB), which contains high-resolution spectroscopic data that have been analyzed in support of the NASA Themis mission. We have derived the abundances of the heavy elements for each star in the SDB sample by fitting the observed FSRs to the theoretical relationships derived from the Solar Census Database (SCD). We find that the derived abundances are in good agreement with those obtained from a recent analysis of high-resolution solar spectrum data (169 elements, this work) and with the chemical composition of the Sun as derived from the study of the solar photosphere (93 elements, these data). We determine the abundances of nine elements (Ce, Cr, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ga, In, and Sn) for which the SCD relationships were derived from a sample of 34 G stars which have no detected magnetic activity. The derived abundances are in good agreement with those obtained from a sample of 14 G stars which have detected magnetic activity (Bohigas et al., 1999). We conclude that the SCD relationships for these elements can be applied to solar twins, even if the latter have magnetic activity. We discuss the impact of the assumptions made in the derivation of the SCD relationships on the derived abundances, and we point out evidence that the diffusion coefficients used to derive the SCD relationships may be too large. We also discuss the impact of the possible differences between the observing and model stars in the derivation of the FSRs on the derived abundances. We find that these effects are negligible for the analysis of the FSRs of low-degree p modes."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a method to search archival radio observations for transients with sensitivity below one Jansky. We show that archival Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations can be searched with a sensitivity of  \u223c 1 \u03bcJansky with a signal-to-noise ratio of  \u223c 5, without any special processing. We present a catalog of 13 new transient sources found in archival VLBI observations, including three sources with fluxes above 10 \u03bcJansky. These transients are correlated with previously known transient sources in the Galactic plane, supporting the hypothesis that the transient population is tightly coupled to the Galactic magnetic field. We find that the observed transient distribution has a power law dependence on Galactic longitude  \u223c -0.35, which is consistent with a simple model in which the transient distribution is controlled by the local magnetic field configuration. Our results imply that the population of transient sources in the Galactic plane is several orders of magnitude larger than previously thought on the basis of optical observations."}
{"text":"\nWe consider exact solutions of semiclassical non-characteristic Cauchy problems for the sine-Gordon equation.

{"text":"\n\nWe present an analysis of planet occurrence rates (PORs) using data from the Kepler Mission, thehadoop Earth-sized planet survey, and the first three years of the TESS mission. We determine the PORs for all stars that are single (i.e. not in a binary system) that have an observed transiting planet, and for all stars that are in a binary system that have an observed transiting planet. We use a single-population model for the single-star data, and a two-population model for the binary-star data, and we fit both models to the data to determine the PORs for each. We find that the PORs for single stars are consistent with the current theories on planet formation, but the PORs for binary stars are higher than expected. This result suggests that the presence of a secondary star has a protoplanetary disk. We also find that the difference between the two PORs increases as the separation between the stars increases, supporting the theory that the most efficient method for planet formation is in a disk that is gravitationally lensed by a giant planet."}
{"text":"\nWe present a detailed analysis of bulk-brane energy exchange in a dynamic cosmological context. Our focus is on the problem of cosmic acceleration and the accompanying gravitational repulsion between matter and bulk-brane. We show that standard assumptions about the energy density of bulk-brane and the bulk-brane density distribution lead to anomalously high values for the energy density of the Universe and the gravitational repulsion between matter and bulk-brane. By taking into account the bulk-brane energy losses due to the bending of bulk-brane and the fact that the energy density of the Universe is constrained by the Friedmann-Roberson-Walker solution, we show that the energy density of bulk-brane has to be smaller than that of matter, resulting in a net attraction between matter and bulk-brane. Our analysis also reveals that the spatial curvature of the Universe has to be either positive or negative, in order for the Universe to be spatially flat and for the energy density of bulk-brane to be negative. We also show that the current standard model of cosmology can be conceptually simplified by regarding bulk-brane as a dynamic, invisible matter, that exerts an attractive force on matter. This new, bulk-brane inspired, picture of the Universe can be used to provide a simple, yet physically correct, explanation of many cosmic phenomena, such as the cosmic acceleration, the matter-to-radiation ratio, the formation of structure, the origin of life, and the transition from a contracting to an expanding Universe."}

{"text":"\nWe consider a class of interconnected systems that we call elementary modular systems (EMS). An EMS is a system composed of a number of interconnected modules, where each module is either active or passive. We give a simple and general stability criterion for this class of systems. In particular, we show that an EMS is stable if and only if all of its passive modules are stable. We apply this criterion to a large class of systems of interest, and show that it has several implications for the study of system stability. In particular, we show that an EMS with a number of active modules equal to the number of passive modules is stable if and only if all of its modules are stable. This answers a question that was left open in a recent paper by Chirat et al. We also show that this criterion can be used to derive a number of interesting and non-trivial stability results for systems that are not necessarily modular. We apply this criterion to a class of systems that are motivated bybiochemical reaction networks.

{"text":"\nWe study the internal structure of granular packings at intermediate densities, in the transition between loose and dense packings. We follow the assembling process of such structures, from the isolated grains to the fully packed state, characterizing the geometry and the internal contact network evolution. We find that the most compact packings are obtained using a special class of simple polyhedral shapes, the so-called Platonic solids, which are among the most space-efficient packings known. The space efficiency and the number of contacts of the Platonic solids granular packings are very close to those of the face-centered cubic (FCC) and the body-centered cubic (BCC) metallic crystals, the most efficient and ordered arrangements of positive metal ions in the crystalline solid state. We also find that, although more efficient, the process of assembling the Platonic solids is much more difficult and requires higher energy and global optimization of the initial conditions, i.e. the shape and the position of the grains. The study of the internal structure of the Platonic solids packings shows that the close packing is not a trivial optimization of the number of contacts, as previously thought, but an optimization of the global energy, which, in addition to the number of contacts, also includes the energetic cost of the curvature and of the local stress field."}
{"text":"\n\nWe investigate the momentum and position wave mechanics of a photon. We show that the continuity equation, which corresponds to the continuity of the momentum density, is satisfied only if the momentum of a photon is related to its frequency and its velocity is equal to the speed of light. Within this framework, we derived the stationary-state solutions of the equation of continuity, which describe the elementary excitations of the momentum field. We found that the solution which corresponds to a free photon has a special structure. It is a superposition of two momentum waves, which have different frequencies and beat against each other. We also investigated the time-evolution of this state and derived the equation for the wave function, which describes the motion of a photon in a paramagnetic medium. The equation has a simple form, which allows one to solve it analytically and to investigate the dynamics of a photon in detail.\n\nWe also considered the problem of finding the position eigenvectors of the stress-energy tensor. We found that the problem can be solved analytically, provided that the symmetrical properties of the tensor are used. The solution shows that the position eigenvectors form a three-dimensional vortex, whose axis is the Poynting vector. We investigated the structure of this vortex and obtained the equations for the position, momentum, and velocity of the vortex core. We also derived an expression for the vortex core energy.\n\nThe results of this work can be used to solve various practical problems in photonics, which deal with the dynamics of photons in paramagnetic media. Our results show that the motion of a photon in such a medium can be well described by a simple equation, which has a meaningful physical meaning and can be solved analytically."}
{"text":"\nWe continue our study of the internal states of model isotropic granular packings. We consider a system of many hard disks interacting through contact forces, with a particular emphasis on the role of the packing geometrical arrangement. We follow a multiphase approach, in which the system is first compressed in one dimension, to obtain the corresponding pressure-volume curves. The one-dimensional theory is then used to investigate the evolution of contact forces and energy in the three-dimensional system. We find that the dependence on the contact force of the total potential energy is very similar to the one-dimensional case, in spite of the strong three-dimensional correlations. Then we study the dependence of the system internal state on the packing arrangement, for a given total potential energy. We find that for a given energy, the contact forces are very different, depending on the arrangement, and that the most stable state is not necessarily the one with the minimum total potential energy. We finally discuss the physical implications of our results, in terms of the real behavior of granular materials."}
{"text":"\nWe continue our study of the internal structure of isotropic granular packings by examining their elastic properties. We find that the dynamic response of the packing to an applied shear strain depends on the exact history of the strain. For a particular class of packings we evaluate the steady-state response to an arbitrary shear strain history and show that the resulting shear modulus is a unique function of the particles' contact numbers in the most compact arrangement of the particles in the packing. The elastic properties of the packings are related to the variation of the shear modulus with the amount of shear strain and the existence of a critical shear strain magnitude below which no further stiffening of the packing is observed. For several examples we show that the dependence of the shear modulus on the shear strain history can be characterized by a single curve that has a critical strain magnitude and a characteristic strain energy scale. We show that a linear stability analysis can be used to derive a criterion for the existence of a critical strain magnitude. We also show that the elastic properties of the packing can be related to the dynamics of the particles as they are driven toward and away from each other by the shear strain. Our results suggest a general methodology for the analysis of the elastic properties of model isotropic packings."}
{"text":"\nWe study the dynamics of an arbitrary quantum dot in the Coulomb blockade regime by means of real-time renormalization group and a systematic evaluation of the relevant cutoff scales. The motivation for our work is the recent interest in engineering nonequilibrium steady states of quantum dots in order to study the physics of entanglement and coherence. We show that the standard technique of analyzing the dynamics in the basis of the Bloch functions of the quantum dot, which has been used very successfully in the context of equilibrium statistical mechanics, breaks down in the nonequilibrium case. Our approach is based on a careful evaluation of the relevant cutoff scales which determine the evolution of the system. We pay particular attention to the interplay between the internal degrees of freedom of the quantum dot and its external driving, which in general results in a complex dynamics with many different time scales. Our analysis shows that a simple qualitative picture, in which the dots are driven either in a resonant or a nonresonant way, is not sufficient to describe the dynamics and that a more subtle picture, taking into account the full spectrum of the driving, is necessary. We show that depending on the details of the dynamics, the steady state of the system can be either a fully coherent state, a partly coherent state, or a completely incoherent state. Our results are consistent with the existence of a sort of a `thermodynamic limit' for the dynamics of driven quantum dots, beyond which the steady state is a completely incoherent state."}
{"text":"\n\nAbstract\nWe present a multi-band polarimetric study of comet Hale-Bopp. Two independent measurements were made: one using a polarimeter in the I band (643 nm), and the other using the E- and F-band polarimeter sensitive in the blue (470 nm) and green (540 nm) regions. These two measurements were made simultaneously during the night of 6 April 1997, when the comet was at a heliocentric distance of 1.44 AU, and the Earth was at a photovoltaic distance of 1.04 AU. We obtained the comet's polarization spectrum in the I band, which consists of a P-band (oriented in the same sense as the local polarization of the incident light) and an S-band (oriented in the opposite sense). We also obtained the ratio of the linear polarization in the E- and F-bands, which shows a strong variation as a function of wavelength. We found that the P-band in the I band increases linearly with the heliocentric distance, while the S-band decreases, so that the total polarization increases. We have explained this behavior on the basis of the increase in the size of the comet as it approaches the Sun, which increases the amount of surface polarization. We found a strong correlation between the total polarization in the I band and the ratio of the polarizations in the E- and F-bands. This correlation can be explained in terms of the two-layer model, according to which the emission from the inner layer is depolarized, while the outer layer emits linearly polarized light, and the intensity ratio of these two layers is constant as a function of the heliocentric distance. We also calculated the polarization of the light scattered by the coma, and found a good agreement between our theoretical prediction and the observation."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a search for dying radio sources in the local universe. We have selected eight galaxies within 80 Mpc that are known to contain an active galactic nucleus (AGN) which is currently in the process of shutting down, and for which there exists a reference radio source, in most cases the currently-active nucleus. We have observed these galaxies in the 1.4 GHz and 6 GHz bands, and have compared the observed radio source properties with those of the reference source when possible. We find that in most cases the dying source is either weaker than the reference source, or it is not detected at all, providing evidence that the radio sources in these galaxies are shutting down. In three galaxies the comparison is inconclusive, due either to insufficient sensitivity, or to the presence of a strong torus that is obscuring the dying source. We have also observed the sources in the 1.4 GHz band in order to search for any new sources that may be brightenning, and have found no evidence for such a source in any of the galaxies. These results provide further evidence that galaxies shut down their radio sources on timescales of several million years. We have also compared the observed 1.4 GHz and 6 GHz properties of the dying sources in order to derive the radio spectral index of each source, and have found that the index is flat in most cases. The one exception is the source in IC 469, for which we find that the index is slightly positive. These results suggest that the simple model of a constant index for all sources is incorrect, and that the index may in fact be slightly negative for most sources, and positive for some sources."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider a 6D gauged chiral supergravity theory with two dynamic supersymmetry generations, with a non-Abelian Ramond sector and with an N-mediated action for the fourth dynamical generation. The model is built on a six-dimensional Minkowski space-time and a three-dimensional non-commutative space-time. The moduli space is the space-time with the structure group of the underlying 12D SO(5) symmetry group. We show that the three-dimensional space-time is the unique (up to isomorphism) universal covering of the moduli space. The covering is realized by a certain class of representations of the twelve-dimensional spinor group. We consider a variety of methods to stabilize the modulus and show that some of them have a common general structure.

{"text":"\n\nStern-Volmer Modeling of Steady-State Forster Energy Transfer Between Dilute, Freely Diffusing Membrane-Bound Fluorophores.\nWe present Stern-Volmer expressions for the steady-state Forster energy transfer between two freely diffusing fluorophores in the same membrane microenvironment. Our analysis demonstrates that the Forster mechanism of energy transfer can be significant in certain biological systems, such as in the case of membrane-bound fluorophores, even when the fluorophores are extremely dilute. To obtain the Stern-Volmer equations, we consider the donor-acceptor complex to be in equilibrium with the freely diffusing unbound donor and acceptor molecules. We obtain an analytical expression for the dissociation constant of the donor-acceptor complex and use this expression to derive the Stern-Volmer equations for the donor-acceptor complex, as well as for the donor and acceptor molecules. We then verify the predictions of our theory by comparison with numerical solutions of the corresponding set of differential equations. Our results suggest that the principles of physical chemistry may be useful in the analysis of non-equilibrium processes in biology."}
{"text":"\n\nThe dynamics of polymer diffusion in a semi-dilute solution in a complex porous medium is studied. We develop a new algorithm to calculate the polymer flux in the presence of an optical probe. Our approach is based on the solution of the fully coupled governing equations for the equilibrium and nonequilibrium statistical mechanic of the polymers in the presence of the optical probe, which yields the time-dependent flux. To solve the non-linear system of equations, we use the combination of the iterative random walk technique and the Lanczos method. The reliability of the algorithm is tested on a model problem. The results are in a good agreement with the available theoretical predictions. We also apply the algorithm to the study of the dynamics of the diffusion of polystyrene sulfonate in a real porous medium, namely, a cancellous bone. The results show that the diffusion in the porous medium is controlled by the porosity, the pore size distribution as well as the chemical and physical interactions between the polymer and the solvent. The obtained results are in a good agreement with the available experimental data."}
{"text":"\n\nA Planetary System Around HD 155358: The Lowest Metallicity Planet Host Star\n\nWe present photometric detections of three confirmed and one unconfirmed planets around the metal-poor solar twin HD 155358. The innermost planet, b, is a typical hot Jupiter with a period of 3.3 days. The middle planet, c, has a period of 8.3 days and is a low-mass object in a close orbit. The outermost planet, d, has a period of 16.3 days and is a high-mass object in a distant orbit. We estimate the mass of c using the radial velocity method, and find it to be 0.31 Jupiter masses. We determine the metallicity of the star to be [Fe\/H] = +0.00 \u00b1 0.02, which is 1\/3 of the metallicity of the Sun. The probability of this system being formed by the accretion of interstellar gas and dust onto the gaseous protoplanetary disk is 1.6%. This probability increases to 5% if the system is formed by the accretion of a rocky planetesimal belt. We estimate that the accretion timescale for a protoplanetary disk is 4.2 Gyr, and the accretion timescale for a rocky planetesimal belt is 1.1 Gyr. Therefore, the accretion timescale is too long to produce this system through the accretion of a protoplanetary disk, but is within the range of the accretion timescale for a rocky planetesimal belt. The metallicity of the star is too low to be explained by the accretion of a protoplanetary disk, but is consistent with the accretion of a rocky planetesimal belt. We discuss the possibility that this planetary system could have formed through the accretion of a giant planetesimal, rather than a protoplanetary disk."}

{"text":"\n\nCosmic ray confinement in fossil cluster bubbles\nWe present here a hypothesis suggesting that the confinement of cosmic rays (CRs) in clusters might be due to the presence of large fossil bubbles in the intra-cluster medium. We show that the average path length of CRs is several times the cluster size, and that it is consistent with a diffusion process in a homogenous and isotropic medium with a small refractive index. The huge deviation from ballisticity observed in the CRs could be due to the statistical combination of small scale structures in the intra-cluster medium. We discuss the main physical mechanisms that might produce these small scale structures, and focus on fossil bubbles resulting from the bubble nucleation and evolution in the early stage of cluster formation. We show that the mean free path of CRs is small compared to the size of the fossil bubbles, and that the probability of a CR to be trapped in a bubble is small provided that the CR energy is larger than a few MeV. Therefore, the statistical combination of small scale structures in the intra-cluster medium does not alter the ballisticity of the CRs. However, for low energy CRs (below a few MeV), we show that the fossil bubbles can efficiently trap the CRs, and explain the confinement observed in the low energy tail of the CR distribution. We also show that this explanation is consistent with the fact that the low energy tail of the CR distribution is sensitive to the presence of a magnetic field. We finally discuss the possible implications of our hypothesis for future cluster observations, and in particular for the study of the intra-cluster medium."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a detailed analysis of the kinematics of spiral arm structure in the nearby galaxy M51. We combine a new set of high-resolution near-infrared images with data from the Hubble Space Telescope to construct a morphological catalog of 712 features, which we use to investigate the dynamics of the arms. We find that the local surface brightness in the arms increases with radius, in strong contrast to the low surface brightness in the interarm regions. We show this using a simple model in which the arm features are treated as moving together in a rigid rotation about the galaxy's nucleus, and the radial variation in surface brightness is explained by a single scale parameter. This has important implications for our understanding of the dynamics of spiral galaxies, as it demonstrates that the arms are not simple density waves, but rather are zones of enhanced surface brightness that grow in radial extent as a function of radius. We discuss several possible physical mechanisms that might give rise to this radial growth, and consider the implications of this work for theories of spiral arm formation and evolution."}
{"text":"\n\nThe kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect can provide a direct measurement of the bulk motions in the intra-cluster medium, and can therefore be used to study the dynamical state of clusters. We present here a detailed analysis of the kSZ effect due to the electrons in our own galaxy, the Milky Way. We derive a simple analytical expression for the kSZ effect in a uniform disk, and use this to derive the first kSZ spectrum of the Milky Way. The resulting kSZ spectrum is in good agreement with observations, and this provides strong evidence that the bulk of the kSZ effect in the local group comes from the intra-cluster medium of the Milky Way. We find that the kinetic temperature in the outer (up to 50 kpc) corona is between 1 and 2 K, while the temperature in the inner (inner than 50 kpc) corona is between 5 and 6 K. We show that the kSZ effect can be used to study the three-dimensional structure of the corona. Our results imply that the corona is rather homogeneously filled, but that there are substantial density fluctuations on scales of a few kpc. We discuss the implications of our results for the formation history of the Milky Way."}
{"text":"\nWe present here a statistical method based on the difference PDF of 21-cm fluctuations that can be used to study the cosmic reionization history with the precision of the observations. Our method is independent of any a-priori assumption about the shape of the difference PDF and therefore is more robust and reliable than the methods based on the analysis of the shape of the difference PDF. Our method is based on the use of the likelihood function and the concept of the probability distribution of the ratio of two independent random variables. We show that the probability distribution of the ratio of two independent random variables is completely determined by the probability distributions of the two random variables and their correlation. We show that this allows one to determine the probability distribution of the difference PDF from the observed data without making any assumption about the shape of the difference PDF. We use this method to analyze the recent 21-cm data from the low frequency array (LOFAR) and the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) to study the reionization history in the first billion years of the Universe."}
{"text":"\nWe consider a model for time-dependent variance with long-term memory. Our interest is in developing a framework within which the relationship between the instantaneous variance and the realized variance can be investigated. The model is characterized by a vector of Ito integrals of the random walk model with stochastic volatility, where the vector of Ito Integrals is defined by an invertible linear operator. The solution of the stochastic differential equations is a martingale, with the martingale measures being related by a scalar factor. We show that this model can be used to generate a family of probability distributions which includes as special cases some well-known probability distributions such as the Heston model and some ad-hoc probability distributions which have some of the properties of the variance. We show how the family can be used to generate a probability distribution which has the property that the realized variance is always greater than or equal to the instantaneous variance. This is in contrast to most existing models for time-dependent variance, in which this property does not generally hold."}
{"text":"\nWe study non-perturbative corrections to the quantum structure of N=1 type IIB superconductors in various compactifications of the underlying lattice models. We show that a generic feature of such corrections is the enhancement of the fragmentation functions as compared to the perturbative results. The difference between the two sets of results is particularly large in the case of the so-called kissing number (or Z) models, where it exhibits a series of plateaux, which can be understood in terms of the structure of the associated finitedimensional representations. We show that the corrections can be organised into three categories, which are related to the different flavour structures which occur in the various compactifications. Within each category the structure of the correction is very similar and can be described by a simple modularity argument. The different categories of corrections have different relationships to the perturbative results, and in particular the so-called KT transition in the perturbative theory corresponds to a transition between two of the categories of non-perturbative corrections."}
{"text":"\n\nWe investigate a system consisting of a single layer graphene sheet with a perpendicular electric field applied, which has a non-zero gradient at the sheet's edge. In contrast to the bulk electric field, the edge field is shown to enhance the electron-phonon coupling in the graphene. The enhanced coupling induced by the edge field is found to have a strong temperature dependence, in contrast to the coupling in the bulk, which is weakly temperature dependent. We explain this difference by a detailed analysis of the mechanism of the electron-phonon coupling in the presence of the edge field. We show that the coupling in the bulk is governed by the standard Boltzmann transport equation, while the coupling in the vicinity of the edge is controlled by a boundary condition, which can be drastically altered by a small change of the edge field strength. We predict that a similar enhancement of the electron-phonon coupling can be achieved by a perpendicular magnetic field, which has a non-zero gradient at the sheet's edge. Our predictions can be tested by a number of recent experiments, which have already probed the interaction between electrons, phonons and an external magnetic field in single layer graphene."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present an analysis of the local stellar velocity field of the solar neighbourhood, based on high-resolution proper motion data from the Hipparchus catalogue and an adaptation of the vector spherical harmonics method. Our aim is twofold: first, to investigate the quality of the empirical galaxy distances that enter the method, and second, to map the large-scale structure of the local velocity field. We find that the galaxy distances can be improved by combining proper motion data with galaxy photometry in a linear estimator, and that this has only a small impact on the large-scale velocity field. We map the local velocity field in the galaxy number density plane, and find that the field is well described by a few modes of a simple power law model. The best-fitting model modes are in good agreement with the large-scale structure revealed by the three-dimensional velocity field. We have also investigated the effect of uncertain galaxy distances on the power law index of the velocity field, and found that the uncertainty has only a small impact on the index. This suggests that the power law description of the local velocity field is robust to the distance uncertainty."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present phase-resolved optical spectroscopy and precise radial velocity measurements of the double pulsar system J0737-3039. The system consists of a white dwarf with a relatively long orbital period (83.12 \u00b1 0.09 min) and a low-mass helium companion in a shorter orbital period (41.36 \u00b1 0.13 min). We find that the white dwarf has a mass of 1.2756 \u00b1 0.0077 M\u2299 and a temperature of 12,620 \u00b1 130 K, and the helium companion has a mass of 0.28 \u00b1 0.01 M\u2299. The projected gradient of the white dwarf's orbital period is 1.35 \u00b1 0.07, consistent with a shallow eccentric orbit. This is significantly smaller than the 2.45 expected from general relativistic corrections for a non-rotating star in a perfectly spherical orbit, but in good agreement with a model in which the white dwarf is slightly elongated along its orbital plane, with a rotationally symmetric oblateness factor of Q = 1.12 \u00b1 0.08. We discuss this in the context of alternative models for the system, and point out that the combination of a relatively long orbital period and a high oblateness factor suggests that the white dwarf is not a traditional HD209458-like prototype, but rather an evolved double-degenerate system with an inner disk-like structure."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a detailed study of the properties of double white dwarfs with masses in the range 1.28 < m1\/m2 < 1.35, which represents the gravitational wave foreground source class of LISA. We find that this source class is characterized by (i) a wide range of individual system masses, (ii) a clear positive trend of the mass ratio m2\/m1 as a function of the total system mass m1 + m2, and (iii) a strong correlation between the mass ratio and the orbital period. We discuss these findings in the framework of different system formation scenarios, and we conclude that the best description of this source class is that of wide binaries, with component masses and orbital periods that are determined by the mass function of a barred population. We show that such systems can be formed through a direct collapse scenario, provided that the initial mass function of the collapsed objects is significantly flatter than that of the final system. We discuss the implications of our results for the study of gravitational waves from such systems, and for the understanding of the formation and evolution of wide binaries in general."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate the evolution of quasi-parallel plane shocks modified by cosmic rays (CRs) in a homogeneous, isotropic, and static turbulence-free interstellar medium. A single CR-modified quasi-parallel plane shock is shown to evolve in a self-similar manner, with the opening angle increasing in a power-law fashion as the shock propagates. This result is consistent with the opening angle evolving in a self-similar manner, in agreement with the Ozmidov-Rontani (OR) relation. A necessary and sufficient condition for the evolution of a single CR-modified shock to be self-similar is derived. Our analytical treatment of this problem also allows us to evaluate the full three-dimensional distribution of the shocked matter in a homogenous and isotropic interstellar medium, which is shown to have a slim form, with a small thickness compared to the plane of the shock. The distribution of the shocked matter is invariant along the shock and is independent of the shock velocity. This has important implications for the determination of the energy fluence rate of the shocked matter, and for the cooling and ionization effects of the shock on the interstellar medium. Our results also suggest that the evolution of a single CR-modified shock is inherently a three-dimensional process, and therefore any simplified one-dimensional treatment of this problem must be done with care."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider a stochastic model of statistical thermodynamics with an infinite number of degrees of freedom. The model is a generalization of the Boltzmann equation to the case of a rapidly growing population of discrete particles subject to a random removal process. The stochastic differential equation for the distribution function of the number of particles has a symmetrical structure in the thermodynamic limit which is shown to imply an exact solution of the equation in the case of a large population size. The solution of the symmetrical structure is related to the solution of the corresponding differential equation with a small population size. In particular, the small population size solution can be recovered from the thermodynamic limit solution by a simple renormalization procedure. As an application, we consider the problem of finding the canonical distribution function of the model. The symmetry of the thermal solution is used to obtain an approximation which is shown to be very efficient for numerical integration."}
{"text":"\n\nWe report measurements of the temperature dependence of the tilt angle landscape and the resulting temperature dependence of the conductance in biphenyl-dithiol (BDT) single-molecule junctions. A systematic increase of the tilt angle from 10\u00b0 to 60\u00b0 as a function of temperature was observed for BDT molecules with an initial tilt angle of 10\u00b0. In contrast, the temperature dependence of the conductance showed a minimum around 40% lower than the conductance at room temperature for a junction with an initial conductance of 10 pS. We attribute this minimum to a transition from a non-linear to a linear regime of the conductance as a function of the tilt angle. Our results suggest that a molecule with a low initial conductance can be tuned to a much higher conductance by controlling the tilt angle, while the energy barrier for the electron tunneling through the molecular gap has a negative temperature dependence, resulting in a minimum conductance around the melting temperature of the junction."}
{"text":"\n\nWe have carried out a high-resolution study of the helium abundance in a sample of 22 galaxy clusters with the aim of testing the correlation between the helium abundance and the ionization state of the intergalactic medium, as well as the reliability of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect as a tracer of the ionized gas in clusters. The clusters cover a wide range in metallicity, ranging from log Z = 7.06 to 8.25, and in ionization state, with log U = 7.08 to 8.78. The gas-phase helium abundance in these clusters is derived from the analysis of the far-infrared spectrum of the CO(1-0) line, measured with the SCUBA camera on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope. Our results show a clear correlation between the helium abundance and the cluster metallicity, but no significant correlation with the ionization state of the intergalactic medium, as traced by the SZ effect. We find a correlation coefficient of 0.81 with cluster metallicity and a scatter of $\\sim 1.5\\%$. The highest helium abundances are found in clusters with metallicities between log Z = 7.5 and 8. The clusters with metallicities below log Z = 7.5 have helium abundances significantly below the mean. The helium abundance in clusters with metallicities above log Z = 8.5 is not significantly different from the mean. We also find no evidence of a correlation between the helium abundance and the ionization state of the intergalactic medium, as traced by the SZ effect. The clusters with the highest ionization states (log U = 7.8-8.8) have helium abundances between $6\\pm 1\\%$ and $8\\pm 1\\%$, while the clusters with the lowest ionization states (log U = 7.0-7.8) have helium abundances between $5\\pm 1\\%$ and $7\\pm 1\\%$. Our results suggest that the helium abundance in clusters is mainly determined by the metallicty of the cluster gas, with no significant contribution from the ionization state of the intergalactic medium. The SZ effect is not reliable as a tracer of the ionized gas in clusters."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present statistical analyses of long-term variability of 539 active galactic nuclei (AGN) at radio frequencies (8-hubis GHz) observed with the VLA and VLBA. We search for long-term (month-scale to decade-scale) trends in the radio continuum and parallel optical data sets. We find that the variability in the radio data sets can be described by a power law with a 1\/f index of \u22121.05 \u00b1 0.05. The scatter in the power law is larger for galaxies with higher redshift and higher radio luminosity. We find that the probability distribution of the number of months between radio variability events is described by an exponential with a decay rate of 1.16 \u00b1 0.14 years. The average lifetime of variability events is 16.7 \u00b1 1.9 years. We find a correlation between the variability amplitude and the variability length in optical data sets: the variability amplitude is proportional to the variability length raised to the power of \u22120.45 \u00b1 0.13. We also find a correlation between the variability amplitude and the optical luminosity: the variability amplitude is proportional to the luminosity raised to the power of 0.72 \u00b1 0.11. We find a correlation between the 1\/f index of the radio data sets and the optical luminosity: the 1\/f index is proportional to the luminosity raised to the power of 0.58 \u00b1 0.11. These results suggest that the variability of AGN at radio frequencies can be described by a simple power law with a 1\/f index of \u22121.05 \u00b1 0.05.

{"text":"\n\nWe present a systematic investigation of the effects of different contact laws and assembling procedures on the structure and mechanical properties of model cohesive powders. We use a simple and robust algorithm to generate initial particles and combine this with different contact models and consolidation strategies. We show that the choice of contact model has a strong influence on the resulting density and structural properties of the powder. For the simple hard-sphere model, we observe that the contact model has little influence on the final density, while for the more realistic Cohesive Wax model, the choice of contact model has a significant effect on the density and the stress\/strain curve. We also find that different assembling procedures can produce powders with very different mechanical properties, in particular for the Cohesive Wax model. Our results suggest that in order to obtain a reliable prediction of the mechanical behavior of cohesive powders, a detailed understanding of the evolution of the contact network during the assembling process is crucial."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a statistical study of the radio spectral and angular characteristics of 19 Class 0 protostars in order to determine the basic observational properties of these objects. Our data sets consist of Imaging Millimeter Array (IMA) images, obtained at similar resolution, of nearby molecular clouds. We find that the mean intensity and the total number of pixels above a given intensity threshold increase with protostellar core size, but the dynamic range, measured by the difference between the mean intensity and the peak intensity, does not increase. We also find that the brightness distribution is well described by a power law. These results suggest that the brightness distribution may be a signature of the energy distribution in the core, with a rather uniform energy distribution in the case of low mass protostars and a large energy difference between the inner and outer regions in the case of high mass protostars. We have derived an empirical relation between the core size and the power law index. The derived relation is consistent with a scaling law in which the index is proportional to the cube of the core radius. This rule has been independently confirmed by an analysis of the brightness distribution in the inner few radii of a subset of cores with available high resolution data. We discuss the implications of these results for the energy distribution in protostellar cores."}
{"text":"\nWe consider positivity and almost positivity of biharmonic Green's functions under Dirichlet boundary conditions. We show that such Green's functions are positive or almost positive on the whole domain for a large class of bounded domains. The motivation for the research is that the boundary conditions for biharmonic Green's functions are not as well understood as the boundary conditions for harmonic Green's functions, and that positivity is a natural generalization of the well-known positive harmonic functions. The key ideas and methodology are that, for a large class of bounded domains, the biharmonic Green's function can be represented as a sum of products of harmonic Green's functions, where the product of two Green's functions is again a Green's function. This allows us to use the known properties of the positivity of harmonic Green's functions. The results obtained are that, under Dirichlet boundary conditions, biharmonic Green's functions are positive or almost positive on the whole domain for a large class of bounded domains, including the class of domains which contain the ball and the disc. The problem work attempts to solve is to show that biharmonic Green's functions are positive or almost positive on the whole domain for a large class of bounded domains. The practical application of the research is that it provides a technique for constructing positive or almost positive functions on a large class of domains, which includes the ball and the disc. The theoretical application of the research is that it provides a technique for studying the positivity of biharmonic Green's functions."}
{"text":"\nWe report the results of a systematic microscopic study of the vortex state with the muon spin rotation technique in the optimally doped YB6 single crystals. The magnetic field dependence of the muon spin rotation in YB6 is found to agree well with the theoretical predictions based on the elementary excitations of the helical magnetically ordered state, suggesting that the low frequency spectrum of the helical vector potential is very close to the singularity-free limit. Our results reveal a clear signature of the Barkhausen transitions between differentially rotating vortex rings, which can be understood in terms of a model in which the individual vortex rings are coupled to a common, rotationally symmetric, background field. We show that the dynamics of the muon spin rotation can be used to probe the low-frequency spectrum of the helical vector potential, and that the theory of elastodynamics can be used to extract the relevant structural information from the data. Our results also show that the careful analysis of the muon spin rotation data can be used to distinguish between different types of vortex core structures."}
{"text":"\nWeak decays of 4He-Lambda\nWe have performed a search for weak decays of 4He-Lambda with the Super-Kamiokande detector in the energy region around the Lambda-notch.

We discuss the possible production mechanisms and decay channels of 4He-Lambda and estimate the corresponding rates. We show that the direct production rate is small but the associated production rate through the intermediate states $^{16}$O and $^{32}$S is large and its contribution to the total rate can be as large as $10^{40}$ (when the branching fraction is assumed to be 1). The theoretical prediction for the branching fraction is uncertain and could be as large as 10^{-3} or as small as 10^{-6}.

{"text":"\n\nIRAS 18511+0146: a proto Herbig Ae\/Be cluster?\n\nWe present photometric and spectroscopic observations of the young stellar object IRAS 18511+0146, which is potentially a member of a proto-Herbig Ae\/Be star cluster. We find that the object is a young stellar object (YSO) with a mass of ~8 M_solar, an age of ~5-10 Myr, and a low accretion rate of ~0.1-0.3 M_dot yr^-1. It is surrounded by a flattened, rotating accretion disc with a mass of ~1.2 M_solar and a thickness of ~20 AU. The disc does not contain much gas, but it is slightly ionized by the central star. We find that the accretion disc has a gas-to-dust ratio of ~2, which is much higher than the value of ~0.1 found in the discs of T Tauri stars. The high gas-to-dust ratio may suggest that the disc is a gas-rich environment, possibly containing a large number of free-floating bodies. However, our analysis also shows that the disc has very low metallicity, which is inconsistent with the idea that the disc is a result of dynamical interactions within a molecular cloud. We discuss various formation scenarios for the disc and find that the most likely scenario is that the disc is a member of a wide binary system that has been formed through the accretion of gas and dust from the surroundings. Our results suggest that wide binaries may play an important role in the formation of massive accretion discs around young stellar objects."}

{"text":"\n\nWe consider the CFT dual of AdS gravity with torsion. We find that the metric and the bulk fields are respectively the glue and the bulk versions of the usual AdS metric and the usual AdS bulk fields, both with torsion. We show that this model is invariant under a special class of two-point functions of the bulk fields, which we call \"gapless bulk operations\". We show that the invariance of the model under these bulk operations is a direct consequence of the bulk-volume conservation. We use the invariance to classify the bulk operations. We show that the special bulk operations which are related to the most simple classes of bulk decompositions, the translations and the boosts, are equivalent to the three-point functions of the bulk fields. We consider the simplest case of a boost, and show that the bulk boost can be understood as the limit of a series of bulk translations. We show that the expansion of the bulk boost is related to the decomposition of the bulk fields in terms of the AdS bulk fields and the AdS glue fields. We also show that the bulk boost is related to the coset space formalism for the AdS bulk fields. We consider the simplest case of a bulk translation, and show that it is related to the transformation of the bulk fields under a change of the AdS bulk coordinate. We show that the AdS glue fields can be expressed in terms of the bulk fields, and that the bulk fields can be expressed in terms of the glue fields and their derivatives. We show that the higher bulk fields can be obtained by repeated applications of the bulk translation and the bulk boost. We also show that the bulk fields are related to the respective images of the bulk fields in the AdS bulk coordinates."}
{"text":"\nWe study the structure of the two-flavor lattice QCD in the epsilon-regime and in the quenched approximation, by means of the chiral Random Matrix Theory. We find a very good agreement between the results obtained from the two different approaches, thus providing a validation of the Random Matrix Theory as a tool to study the structure of the confined quark-gluon plasma. The main difference between the two approaches is that in the Random Matrix Theory the collinear and the non-collinear parts of the gluon degrees of freedom are not treated on the same footing, the non-collinear part being related to the underlying lattice structure, while in the lattice QCD the collinear and non-collinear degrees of freedom are both treated as being equally important. This might suggest that the non-collinear part of the gluon field in the quark-gluon plasma has a greater degree of freedom than the collinear part, in spite of the fact that both the collinear and non-collinear parts contribute to the dynamical correlation functions in a similar way as in the meson exchange theory."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a new method for measuring the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) scale using the SDSS and 2dFGRS, and use it to derive the BAO scale in a redshift range 0.155 < z_max < 1.031, which corresponds to a comoving volume of $\\sim 2.23\\cdot 10^{46}$ Mpc$^3$. We find that the scale is $\\sim 156$ Mpc at the start of the volume and $\\sim 134$ Mpc at the end. We also find that the scale is well described by a power law, $L(z)=\\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{\\dot{L}}{\\dot{z}} \\right)^{3}$ in the volume, where $\\dot{L}$ and $\\dot{z}$ are the relative BAO scale change and the redshift, respectively. This power law can be well described by a simple model in which the BAO scale is taken to be the distance at which the density fluctuations are at their peak, and the scale is allowed to change as the BAO mode propagates out from the matter peak to the voids. This model explains why the BAO scale is larger at high redshift, and has a more rapid decline in the vicinity of galaxies. We also derive the bulk flow velocity in our volume, and find it to be $\\dot{z}_{\\rm bulk} = \\pm 5.2 \\cdot 10^{22}$ km$^{-1}$. We show that this bulk flow velocity is consistent with a model in which the bulk flow velocity is the same in both directions, but the BAO scale is larger in one direction. We discuss our results in the context of other recent BAO scale measurements, and find that they are consistent with the BAO scale being relatively large at high redshift, and that it decreases monotonically towards the local universe. We also show that our results are consistent with the BAO scale being a genuine scale, in the sense that the large scale structure in our volume is not well described by a fractal model."}
{"text":"\nWe present a study of the evolution of the color-magnitude distribution of galaxies in fields selected from the 2 Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) to high redshift. We find a marked difference in the distribution of galaxies in the blue sequence at z~0 and at z~3, with the number of galaxies in the bright end of the blue sequence being much higher at z~0. We show this is likely due to a different mode of evolution of these galaxies. At high-redshift, the number density of galaxies in the blue sequence declines much faster with magnitude than it does at z~0, which implies that field galaxies at high-reditude are evolving to higher redshift. We show this evolution can be described using a simple model in which the number density of galaxies in the blue sequence is related to the number density of galaxies in the red sequence, with the relation being different at high and low-redshift. The model also predicts that the slope of the color-magnitude distribution of the field galaxies should change from being shallower at low-redshift to being steeper at high-redshift, and we show this is indeed the case. We also discuss the implications of this finding for the evolution of galaxies in general."}
{"text":"\n\nWe have developed a new algorithm to evaluate the stiffness of bottlebrush polymers in a solvent, which takes into account the anisotropic features of the polymer in a simple and efficient way. The practical application of this algorithm is the prediction of the unknown properties of bottlebrush polymers, which has important consequences in many practical applications, such as the design of new polymers for drug delivery systems. The new algorithm is based on the evaluation of the difference between the solvent-induced energy and the energy of the collapsed state of the polymer, the so-called collapse energy, which gives the difference between the measured stiffness and the intrinsic stiffness of the polymer. The intrinsic stiffness is evaluated from the statistical properties of the monomers, such as the polymerization number and the Flory radius. The practical use of this algorithm is illustrated with the prediction of the stiffness of a new generation of polymers, the so-called double-combed bottlebrush polymers, which have been recently synthesized and which are of great interest for the design of new drug delivery systems."}
{"text":"\n\nThe motivation for the research was the need for a precise method of determining metallicities in late-type stars. The problem with the currently used methods is that they are all affected by temperature errors.

The methodology was to derive a calibration curve for the triplet lines in order to convert the observed magnitudes into metallicities. The results obtained were that the method is feasible, with a typical error of about 0.05dex. The problem the work attempts to solve is the need for a precise method of determining metallicities. The practical application of the work is that it provides a new method for the derivation of metallicities, which is not temperature sensitive. The theoretical implications of the work are that the method can be used to derive metallicities for very low mass stars, which is not possible with the currently used methods."}

The quasar is a bright source of the CN radical. The observations were made in February and March 1998. We have detected an optical radiation from the quasar in the frequency range 55\u201358 GHz. This is the first detection of optical emission from a quasar in this frequency range. The detection of the CN radical in the quasar is significant because this is the first time that this molecule has been detected in a quasar. This is also the first time that the CN radical has been detected in a source where the CO radical is also present. The observations of the CN radical in the Cloverleaf Quasar at z=2.56 are also significant because this is the first time that the CN radical has been detected in a source that is not a galaxy. The results of our observations are consistent with the CN radical being produced in the inner region of the accretion disc. The radiative lifetime of the CN radical in the inner region of the accretion disc is estimated to be about 1.2 kyr. The observations also suggest that the CN radical is present in the outer region of the accretion disc. The outer region of the accretion disc is optically thick. The CN radical is not detected in this region. The inner region of the accretion disc is optically thin. The CN radical is detected in this region. The radiative lifetime of the CN radical in the outer region of the accretion disc is estimated to be about 5 kyr. The production rate of the CN radical in the inner region of the accretion disc is estimated to be about 6.6 \u00d7 1028 molecules s-1. The production rate of the CN radical in the outer region of the accretion disc is estimated to be about 1.5 \u00d7 1029 molecules s-1."}
{"text":"\n\nRenormalized Quantum Yang-Mills Fields in Curved Spacetime\n\nWe consider the question of the extent to which a renormalization group transformation can be used to simplify the construction of a quantum theory of gravity. We show that in a wide class of examples, the answer is encouraging. We begin by recalling the correspondence between four-dimensional (4D) spacetimes and 3D objects, which allows one to view the dynamics of a theory of gravity in a geometrically intuitive fashion. We then consider a family of 4D spacetimes which can be obtained by iterated subdivisions of a 3D fractal object. We show that a renormalization group transformation can be used to simplify the description of the quantum theory of gravity on these examples. In particular, we show that the 3D fractal can be replaced by a 2D one, and that the quantum theory can be made asymptotically free. Our results suggest that the construction of quantum theories of gravity on certain classes of 4D spacetimes can be simplified substantially, providing a kind of 'type-II' string theory in higher dimensions."}

The proposed scheme is applicable to a large number of users, and is particularly suitable for environments in which users may frequently appear and disappear, as is common in wireless communication systems.\n\nThe growing demand for wireless communication has resulted in a shortage of available frequency bands. One solution to this problem is to allow multiple users to share a single frequency band, which can be achieved using multiuser detection techniques. Multiuser detection is a technique that allows a receiver to separate the information from multiple users that are transmitting on the same frequency band. However, conventional multiuser detection schemes are not suitable for use in dynamic environments, in which users may frequently appear and disappear. In such environments, it is necessary to be able to identify the presence of new users, as well as to determine the arrival times of their respective transmissions.\n\nWe propose a novel scheme for multiuser detection in a dynamic environment, which is based on user identification via correlation detection and data detection via decision-directed detection.

{"text":"\nWe consider collective modes in two-band superconductors. The bands are coupled in a symmetry-protected topologically non-trivial way, and the model is constructed so that the two bands have different two-particle correlation functions, in a fashion analogous to the d-wave\/s-wave pairing in a conventional superconductor. We find that the modes are very sensitive to the particular form of the coupling, and in particular, that a very large number of modes can be excited, provided that the coupling is sufficiently non-trivial. We show that such a rich spectrum of modes is related to the large spin-flavor locking angle that is present in the two-particle correlation functions. We also show that, although the modes are very sensitive to the form of the coupling, they are, in a certain sense, much less sensitive to the particular form of the two-particle correlation functions. This is shown by considering the limit in which the two-particle correlation functions are replaced by a complex plane wave, which is then used to construct a 'collective mode sum' that is equivalent to the original mode sum, with the two-particle correlation functions replaced by a complex plane wave. We show that the modes are very robust against small changes in the two-particle correlation functions, provided that the changes are not too large. This has important implications for the nature of the excitations in a two-band superconductor, and suggests that a relatively large number of collective excitations can be excited, provided that the two bands are coupled in a sufficiently non-trivial way."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider a model of a finite chain of rigid disks connected by elastic cords, which is placed on a flat surface and subjected to an arbitrarily time-dependent strain. The equilibration of this system is investigated by a combination of analytical and numerical techniques, which allows us to evaluate the out-of-equilibrium relaxation rates for the shape and the elastic line. Our main result is an exact formula for the relaxation rate of the elastic line, which is shown to agree with previous approximate results obtained from a statistical mechanics approach. In addition, we also obtain an approximate formula for the relaxation rate of the shape. The parameters of our model can be related to the characteristics of the experimental system and the imposed strain in a straightforward manner, which allows us to study the effect of the relevant parameters on the relaxation rate. Our results show that the relaxation rate increases with the number of disks and decreases with the cord stiffness and the spatial correlation of the strain. We also find that the relaxation rate has a minimum, which depends on the cord length and the strain correlation."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present high-resolution Li abundances for ten X-ray binaries in which the companion is a low-mass star or a white dwarf. Our main aim is to determine the origin of the Li in these systems. The analysis includes six LMXBs (1036 CM, 1310 Dexter, 1367 Tacitus, 1395 jewels, 1412 DOM, and 1745Sharing), two HMXBs ( ByteArray andperfcapella), and two anomalous X-ray sources (XTE J1845-0208 andThusPORT). We find that the Li abundances in the LMXBs are well described by a power law with a characteristic abundance of 4.4 R watchdog and a scatter of +0.8 \u00b1 0.7 R watchdog. The power law is consistent with the Li being inherited from the companion. In contrast, the HMXBs and the anomalous X-ray sources have Li abundances that are 1.5 R watchdog to 4 R watchdog larger than the LMXBs. The scatter in the HMXBs is also larger, being +2.0 \u00b1 1.4 R watchdog. The origin of the Li in the HMXBs and anomalous X-ray sources is unclear, but it could be primordial.

{"text":"\nWe consider effective material parameters for a class of mesoscopic thin layers that can be modeled as single and double grids of interacting loaded wires. Our approach is based on the construction of the internal energy and the determination of the associated thermodynamic parameters. The model is capable of describing a large class of materials, including metals, ceramics, and semiconductors. Within this framework, we investigate the role of the internal structure in the determination of the effective material parameters, in particular, the temperature-dependent behavior of the Young's modulus and the thermal expansion coefficient. We analyze the effects of the parameters of the underlying lattice (e.g., the lattice constant and the atomic mass) as well as the parameters of the coating (e.g., the coating thickness and the volume filling fraction) on these parameters. Our results show that the effective Young's modulus and the effective thermal expansion coefficient are very sensitive to the details of the internal structure and, in particular, to the symmetry of the structure."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a study of star formation in the small magellanic cloud. A catalog of about 11,000 stars between -70 and -10 deg. in Galactic coordinates is extracted from Spitzer\/IRAC images of the region between NGC 602 and N 90. The catalog is used to study the distribution of young stellar objects, as traced by their infrared colors. We find four distinct groups of young stellar objects distributed along an arc of about 2.5 deg. radius around the most massive young stellar object in the Small Magellanic Cloud, the stellar cluster NGC 602. The ages of the stars in each group are estimated to be in the range 2-10 Myr. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that the youngest stars are in the cluster and the ages increase smoothly outward, but are inconsistent with the hypothesis that the stars are all of the same age and have been formed in a single event. The number of stars in the four groups is consistent with the hypothesis that they were formed in four separate events, but inconsistent with the hypothesis that there were more than four events. The four groups of stars have temperatures and metallicities that are consistent with the hypothesis that they were formed from the same gas cloud, but inconsistent with the hypothesis that they formed from four different gas clouds. We discuss several scenarios that could explain the data, and conclude that the most likely explanation is that the region is the result of four relatively rapid and nearly simultaneous star-forming events. This scenario requires that the gas cloud from which the stars have been formed has a complex internal structure."}
{"text":"\nWe report on a systematic investigation of a trappped gas of ultracold fermionic atoms in the presence of a longitudinal magnetic field in the BCS-BEC crossover regime. We observe a transition from a balanced superfluid state to an imbalanced state with the appearance of a lean gap in a large fraction of the trap volume. The fraction of the unbalanced phase increases with the magnetic field and reaches a value of 65% for a field of 4 T. The phase structure of the unbalanced state is such that a large fraction of the atoms is in a singlet state, in spite of the fact that the singlet pairing correlation is strongly disfavored over the triplet pairing correlation in the balanced state. We explain this observation by a qualitative model which we verify quantitatively by performing a numerical integration of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations for a model atom in the presence of a longitudinal field. Our results suggest that the imbalanced superfluid state is an example of a strongly interacting many-body system with a triplet pairing correlation which has a finite fraction of singlets."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a simple and robust method for the calibration of mid-infrared star formation rate indicators. We show that the method is applicable to a wide variety of indicators and that it provides an improvement over previously used methods. The main idea is to model the star formation rate indicator as a function of both the star formation rate and the age of the stellar population. Age-calibrated star formation rate indicators can then be obtained by fitting the model to observed data. We illustrate the method by calibrating two indicators, the far-infrared color index and the mid-infrared excess, using a large sample of nearby galaxies from the burst-era Universe. The results from our calibration exercise are in good agreement with previous work and indicate that the method is reliable and accurate. The calibration method is not limited to any specific indicator and should be applicable to any analysis of mid-infrared data where the stellar population age needs to be taken into account."}

Our derivation is based on a physical-optics analysis of the wave propagation in the telescope. We obtain the distribution of the optical path length in the telescope by ray-tracing. We use this distribution in our physical-optics analysis. We confirm the validity of our approach by comparing our results with previously published results obtained by other methods. We also present a simple and accurate expression for the relative aperture efficiency as a function of the optical path length in the case of a telescope with a single dish.

{"text":"\n\nWe consider the properties of Lorentzian and signature changing branes in a general framework of a 4-dimensional spacetime with a non-trivial metric and non-zero cosmological constant.

The resulting signatures of the branes are (3+1)-dimensional, (2+2)-dimensional and (1+3)-dimensional. We show that all bulk vibrational states of such a brane must be (3+1)-dimensional. We show that in a generic theory with a non-trivial bulkmetric and non-zero cosmological constant the bulk vibrational states can be (2+2)-dimensional as well as (1+3)-dimensional. The relevant bulkmetric functions are related to the stress-energy tensor and the bulk Lorentzian condition is shown to be equivalent to the energy conditions in the bulk.

{"text":"\n\nWe present photometric and spectroscopic observations of a sample of 21 galaxies in the field of theGOODS-MIPS imaging survey, which we use to measure the star formation rate (SFR) and stellar mass of field galaxies in the redshift range z=0-1. We find that the SFRs of these galaxies are generally low, with a median value of only 2.5% of the SFR of the Milky Way. This is consistent with the suggestion that the global star formation rate in the local universe has declined by a factor of about five since z=1. We also find that the median stellar mass of our sample is 5.4 times that of the Milky Way, indicating that these galaxies are significantly more massive than average local galaxies. The SFRs of our sample galaxies are not correlated with their stellar mass, radius, or surface or absolute visual magnitude. We discuss several possible explanations for our results, and conclude that the most likely explanation is that the gas fractions of these galaxies are much lower than local galaxies, and that this has led to a lower SFR. We also suggest that the combination of a low gas fraction and a high stellar mass may imply the presence of a central black hole with a mass of 104-105 solar masses. Such a black hole would have a significant impact on the evolution of a galaxy, and could potentially prevent the galaxy from forming stars."}

The non-correlation matrix element represents the non-correlated motion of the GC and can be used to derive the peculiar velocity. We show that the peculiar velocity has a lower limit of  \u223c3 km s \u2212 1 for oldGCs and a upper limit of  \u223c120 km s \u2212 1 for youngGCs. We also show that the ratio of the peculiar velocity to the systemic velocity has a uniform lower limit of  \u223c1.5 and a uniform upper limit of  \u223c5 for all GCs.

This method, which we have called Point-Contact Spectroscopy by Non-Tunneling Current (PCSNT), has several advantages over the usual method of point-contact spectroscopy using a metal tip. It is much easier to make a good point contact with a semiconductor tip than with a metal tip, since the semiconductor tip can be made very sharp and has a much higher thermal stability. In addition, the PCSNT method can be used to study the electrical properties of the normal state as well as the superconducting state, whereas the usual method can only be used for the superconducting state.\n\nWe have used the PCSNT method to study the electronic structure of the normal state and the superconducting state of the heavy-fermion superconductor HoNi2B2C.

We discuss the possible consequences of this result. We also consider a simpler model, where the particles are quantum particles and where entanglement is replaced by perfect correlation. We show that in this case, the number of particles is well defined, but the concept of particle number is still not unambiguous, because one can not distinguish the particles by their physical properties.

{"text":"\n\nWe reexamine the classical equivalence principle in the light of the recent observations of the cosmic microwave background anisotropy and the accelerating expansion of the Universe. After reviewing the various explanations that have been proposed to account for the observed anisotropy, we show that the simplest explanation that is consistent with the equivalence principle is a cosmological model in which the energy density of the universe is everywhere the same, but the pressure is not. We show that such a model can be made to be consistent with the observed anisotropy, without the introduction of ad-hoc birefringent scalar fields. In the framework of such a model the anisotropic stress can be related to the one-way motion of gravity waves, thus providing a possible physical explanation for the observed anisotropy.

The problem of finding the quadrature of the circle, i.e. the area of the circle, is one of the most famous problems in mathematics.

The solution to the problem of finding the quadrature of the circle was given by Archimedes of Syracuse (287-212 BC), one of the greatest mathematicians of the ancient world.\n\nThe motivation for this work is to present a new approach to the problem of finding the quadrature of the circle, based on a certain passage of Descartes. The key idea is to use the formula for the area of a triangle with base C and height \u03c0, and to find the area of a circle by dividing it into two pieces, and then adding the areas of the two resulting triangles. The area of the circle is then equal to the sum of the areas of the two triangles.

Our sample consists of 62 unreddened RSGs with MK magnitudes in the range MK \u2248 \u22121 to 1, and this is the largest homogeneous RSG sample in a low-mass galaxy to date. We find that the LMC and SMC contain both relatively cool and relatively hot RSGs, but the distribution of temperatures is not uniform. The coolest RSGs tend to be concentrated in the eastern half of the LMC and in the SMC, while the hottest RSGs are found in the western half of the LMC. We determine the stellar masses of our RSGs from an updated version of the stellar evolution model by rgbde. We find that the LMC contains more massive RSGs than the SMC, and that the distribution of stellar masses in the LMC is not uniform. The lowest stellar masses are found in the eastern half of the LMC, while the highest stellar masses are in the western half. We also compare the absolute magnitude (M) - temperature (T) relation for our RSGs with theoretical predictions by theory by 1996RGB and theory by 2005RF, and find that our RSGs are consistent with these relations.

{"text":"\n\nWe investigate the minimum gap-opening planet mass (GM) for a planet in an irradiated circumstellar accretion disk. We show that the minimum GM depends sensitively on the accretion rate onto the disk, and for high accretion rates the minimum GM can be as low as several Jupiter masses. We also find that the minimum GM depends weakly on the disk viscosity parameter, and for most values of the viscosity parameter, the minimum GM is in the range of several Jupiter masses. These results suggest that giant irradiated accretion disks can be stable against gravitational collapse only if they are supported by a planet or aproto-planetary object with a mass in the range of several Jupiter masses or greater. For the lowest accretion rates considered, the minimum GM is much greater than several Jupiter masses, and in this case the disk is stable against gravitational collapse even in the absence of a planet or a proto-planetary object.

{"text":"\n\nWe present a catalog of high-precision space velocities for 42 globular clusters in the solar neighborhood, derived from data obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope. These clusters are all of type II and lie at a mean Galactic latitude of ~17 deg, so that they have avoided the strong gravitational perturbations in the Galactic plane. We have therefore used them as a control sample to study the Galactic diffusion in a cleaner environment than is possible in the Galactic plane. We find that these clusters have indeed experienced much less gravitational perturbation, but that they have not avoided the tidal field of the Galaxy, as their space velocities show clear signs of correlation with the Galactic potential. By comparing the space velocities of clusters in the Galactic plane with those of the low-latitude sample, we find that the amplitude of the fluctuations in the Galactic potential is at least 4-5 km s^-1. We estimate that clusters take on average 4-5 Gyr to migrate from one Galactic potential well to another. We have also measured the space velocity of the globular cluster Terzan 5, which lies at a Galactic latitude of ~8 deg. It is the first cluster for which a measurement of this type has been possible, thanks to the very precise position of its two distinct stellar populations. The space velocity of the cluster's low-mass component is clearly different from that of the high-mass component, in agreement with the hypothesis that the cluster has been affected by a Galactic tide."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a model of terrestrial planet formation in a wide variety of binary star systems. We find that the habitable zone in a binary system is much larger than in a single star system, and therefore a much larger number of planets can be formed within a given range of orbital distances. We also find that planets in a tight orbit around their host star are more likely to form in a wide binary system than in a single star system, because the star's tidal interaction with its companion provides a stronger constraint on the planet's orbit. In addition, we find that planets are more likely to form in a wide binary system than in a single star system, because the wider habitable zone provides a greater area in which to form planets. We also find that the tidal interaction between a planet and its host star can produce large changes in the planet's orbital elements, which can lead to the ejection of the planet from the habitable zone. We discuss the implications of our findings for the formation and evolution of terrestrial planets."}

These results allow us to derive the expected number of observed pulsars in a globular cluster for which the Shapiro effect can be observed as a function of the cluster's mass and radius. Finally, we discuss the prospects for detecting the Shapiro effect for pulsars in globular clusters using current and future telescopes, as well as the prospects for detecting the Shapiro effect for pulsars in other types of stellar aggregates, such as open clusters and star clouds."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present the BLOX cluster catalog, a statistically selected sample of optically-selected galaxy clusters selected from the Bonn Lensing Survey (BLS), designed to provide a benchmark for cluster detection and catalog construction methods in relatively low-overlap survey data. The BLS is a wide-field, depth-limited survey conducted with the Hubble Space Telescope, which has been used to study the distribution of galaxies and the large-scale structure of the Universe on scales of up to 1 hMpc. We describe the methodology used to select clusters in the BLS, and the resulting catalog properties. We find that the BLOX cluster catalog is well-populated in the range of cluster masses which are most efficiently sampled by depth-limited surveys, and that it contains a significant population of very weak clusters, which are not well represented in most other cluster catalogs. The BLOX cluster catalog has a well-defined redshift distribution, and a correlation with the density field measured by the BLS, but is uncorrelated with the field measured by the 2dF redshift survey.

{"text":"\n\nWe have carried out a statistical study of the distribution of metallicities in protoplanetary disks. We find that the probability distribution of metallicities follows a power law, G(Z) \u221d Z^(\u03b1), with a > \u22121. The parameters of the power law vary with the initial mass of the disk, the rotational period of the disk, and the evolutionary state of the disk. We have found no evidence that supernova (SN) feedback has a significant effect on the mass distribution of protoplanetary disks. The probability distribution of the radius of protoplanetary disks shows a steep decrease at small radii and a power law tail with a negative power of \u22121. This is consistent with the assumption that the mass distribution is a truncated power law and there is no significant SN feedback. We have developed a method to estimate the rotational period of protoplanetary disks from the power law index of the probability distribution of metallicities. The estimated rotational period depends weakly on the initial mass and the evolutionary state of the disk. We have found that the rotational period increases with the age of the disk. This may be due to the increasing frequency of giant planet formation and the associated strong friction in the protoplanetary disk."}
{"text":"\nWe discuss astrophysical and cosmological implications of large volume string compactifications in a formal academic and scientific writing voice. We use the first plural person form. We use active voice. We are motivated by the question of whether the large volume string compactifications can provide a realistic model of the universe, and by the question of whether string compactifications can be used to quantize gravity. We review the mathematical structure of string compactifications. We show that there are many string compactifications with a large volume. We show that these large volume string compactifications have many different bulk properties, and that there is no clear relationship between the bulk properties and the cosmological properties of the resulting universes. We show that the large volume string compactifications do not provide a good model for the evolution of the universe, unless we assume that the volume is very small. We also discuss the problem of quantizing gravity.

{"text":"\nWe present surface brightness profiles for a sample of 52 globular clusters in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds and Fornax Galaxy. The clusters were selected to have no significant radio or X-ray sources in their cores, and are therefore thought to be relatively metal-poor. The clusters were observed with the Hubble Space Telescope, and the surface brightnesses were derived from the cluster photometry. We present the surface brightness as a function of radius, and discuss the clusters in terms of their color and periodicity. We find that the surface brightness profiles for the clusters in the Magellanic Clouds are well described by a power law. In contrast, the clusters in Fornax show a wide variety of profiles, with no single profile dominant. We also present the surface brightness as a function of distance from the center for each cluster. We find a strong correlation between the radius and the distance at which the surface brightness peaks. The period of oscillation of the surface brightness as a function of radius is also presented for each cluster. The clusters in the Magellanic Clouds have radii of 2-3 times the period of oscillation, consistent with the clusters having grown by the accretion of matter in a virialized orbit. The clusters in Fornax have radii 10 times larger than their periods of oscillation, consistent with the clusters having formed through the collapse of a large gas cloud."}
{"text":"\nWe present a systematic study of the formation of galaxy clusters within a suite of state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, with special focus on the preheating scenario. We compare the cluster formation in the simulations with an analytic model of cluster formation and find that the model and the simulation results are in a good agreement, in the sense that the model explains the simulation results and the simulation results are consistent with the model. The clusters in the simulations are found to be smaller on average than the clusters in the analytic model. We show that this is likely due to the cooling of the intergalactic gas in the clusters, which in turn is due to the injection of the massive amounts of energy in the early universe by the inflationary cosmology. We then compare the cluster formation in the simulations with the observations of the large scale structure and find that the clusters in the simulations are much more massive, on average, than the clusters observed in the large scale structure. We show that this is likely due to the fact that the simulations include the cooling of the gas while the observations do not.

We consider several strategies for solving linear tabling problems and show that a simple strategy, calledJM, is nearly-optimal in several cases. We then present an optimization of this strategy that results in a parameterized algorithm for several natural problems, including a variation of the quadratic sensor network problem, the kissing number problem on the projective plane, and a problem related to fast exponentiation. Along the way, we show that a significant number of lower bounds on the running time of linear tabling heuristics are tight. In particular, we show that the previously known tight lower bounds for the hitting time of a line and the d-hitting time of a line are also tight for several other natural linear tabling problems, including the longest increasing subsequence on a line, the convex hull of a set of points on a line, and the minimum vertex degree problem on a line.

{"text":"\nWe present a study of the global properties of elliptical and lenticular galaxies with recent star formation (SF), based on a sample of galaxies in the local volume selected from the 2 Micron All Sky Survey. We determine the content of gas, stars, and dust in these galaxies, and find that the fraction of gas and stars is similar to that in galaxies in the same morphological class in the distant universe, while the dust content is much lower. We show that this is consistent with the prediction of the Bar and Barnhardt (BB) model, which suggests that the gas and star content of galaxies is independent of morphology, while the dust content depends strongly on morphology. We find that the local galaxies in our sample have lower gas content than distant galaxies, and that this difference is particularly large for galaxies with high star formation rates, suggesting that gas is being lost from these galaxies. We discuss this gas loss in the context of the recent compilation of galaxy group catalogs, and find that the local galaxies in our sample are preferentially associated with groups that contain many galaxies with recent star formation, suggesting that the gas is being removed through interactions with other galaxies in the group. We also discuss our results in the context of the recently proposed Bar and 2006 (B06) model, which suggests that local galaxies are formed through the transformation of distant galaxies, and find that our results are consistent with this model."}
{"text":"\n\nAnalytic steady-state space use patterns and rapid computations in mechanistic home range analysis\nWe developed a new method for analyzing space use data that has several advantages over conventional methods. The conventional methods assume that the space use pattern can be described by a step function, but this assumption is not biologically realistic. Also, conventional methods are computationally expensive and require parameterization of an error function and an optimization procedure. Our new method is based on the steady-state assumption, which is a biologically realistic assumption, and an analytic solution of the steady-state model. Therefore, our new method is both biologically and computationally efficient. Also, our method enables us to obtain instantaneous density maps of animals at different spatial scales, from the local scale to the landscape scale. We applied our new method to the analysis of space use data of lions, raccoons, and domestic cats. The results showed that the new method was biologically realistic, produced biologically meaningful results, and was computationally efficient."}
{"text":"\n\nSN 2006bp: Probing the Shock Breakout of a Type II-P Supernova\n\nThe hydrodynamic evolution of a Type II-P supernova (SN II-P) is governed by the competition between the expansion of the hydrogen-rich envelope and the inward-moving material accelerated by the newly formed NS. In particular, the interaction between the shock waves generated by these two motions gives rise to a rich variety of physical processes that have been observed in SNe II-P, including long-duration X-ray flares and phenomenological homologs of the undertail andMach effects. We present here results of a systematic numerical study of the shock breakout process in SNe II-P. We have performed large-scale 3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations, specifically designed to study the evolution of the shock waves, from the onset of the shock breakout till the end of the hydrodynamic phase. Our results reveal that the shock waves are not only able to affect the mass distribution in the envelope but also to drive large-scale dynamics, such as turbulence, that strongly modify the hydrodynamic evolution of the envelope. We have found that the shock waves can be efficiently trapped in the outer layer of the envelope and can excite large-scale fluctuations that dampen the shock waves in a quasistatic manner. Our analysis shows that the dynamics of the shock waves and the resulting distribution of the matter in the envelope are governed by the balance between the inward and outward kinetic energy fluxes, with the energy being constantly converted from one form to the other. We discuss the physical origin of the kinetic energy fluxes and the resulting distribution of the matter in the envelope."}

We show that in this case the problem can be reduced to a two-dimensional (2D) problem of slow wave resonance in a periodic stack of isotropic layers.

{"text":"\n\nWe have developed a new technique to measure the slip length in a Newtonian fluid using a torsional ultrasonic oscillator. The technique is based on the fact that the back and forth motion of a torsional resonator in a fluid results in a superposition of the torsional and extensional components in the fluid. By driving the resonator at a frequency at or near one of its eigenmodes, the energy transfer from the resonator to the fluid can be highly efficient. We use this effect to measure the slip length by comparing the energy consumption required to drive the resonator at different frequencies. We show that this technique is independent of the detailed shape of the resonator, the energy transfer efficiency, the amplitude of the resonator's motion, and the inertial and frictional forces in the fluid. We demonstrate a slip length measurement sensitivity of better than 10% with a standard deviation of 2.5% in a Taylor flow. The proposed technique has the potential for measuring the slip length with high sensitivity and precision in any Newtonian fluid, including liquids and gases, in a variety of flow geometries, and with a range of resonator shapes and driving frequencies."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider the action of a particular class of periodically performingservomechanisms, called quasi- suspensory servomechanisms, on the mechanical response of a single-degree-of-freedom system.

In the case of a periodically performing servomechanism, the prescribed law is a periodic motion. We derive a general expression for the resulting periodic motion of the driven system. We analyze the effects of several parameters of the servomechanism on the resulting motion. In particular, we show that, in some cases, the output motion may have a frequency that is different from that of the driving motion. Finally, we study the special case of quasi-suspensory servomechanisms, which are of interest in the field of mechanical vibrations.

{"text":"\n\nWe present kinematic models of the evolution of massive stars in the triaxial halo of the Milky Way. We solve the orbits of relativistic stars in a potential field constructed from the Galactic potential and a SmoothWitness kernel that describes the relative contributions of massive and lightweight stars to the total potential. We find that massive stars can be dynamically important in the outer Galactic halo, and that the orbits of massive stars are well described by the potential of a single star of mass equivalent to the total baryonic mass in the halo. The scale-free potential of the triaxial halo is well described by a power law with an index of 1.8. We compare our predictions with observations of the kinematics of hypervelocity stars (HVSs), and find that a model in which massive stars are dynamically important in the Galactic halo can reproduce observations of the distribution of HVSs in the Galactic plane, their radial velocity distribution, and the orbital parameters of the few HVSs with known orbits. Our model also predicts that massive stars should be preferentially found in the leading arms of the Galactic halo, and that the number of massive stars should be inversely proportional to the local surface density of the Galactic halo. We discuss the implications of our work for the dynamical evolution of massive stars, and for observations of massive stars and HVSs."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a comparison of the dust-to-gas ratios (DGRs) in luminous, ultraluminous, and hyperluminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs, ULIRGs, and HULIRGs) based on a sample of 51 galaxies drawn from the LIRG Survey. We find a strong correlation between the DGR and the specific star formation rate (sSFR), with both increasing by factors of 2-3 in the highest sSFR bins. This correlation holds for both the total DGR and its diagnostic components (the dust emission line and the black body) in the rest frame, as well as for the DGR corrected for lensing. We show that this correlation is inconsistent with the assumption that the DGR is proportional to the accretion rate of gas onto the galaxy. We discuss several non-accretion mechanisms that could explain a correlation between the DGR and the sSFR, and find that the best fit is given by a model in which the DGR is proportional to the sSFR cubed. This proportionality can arise if the DGR is determined primarily by the star formation efficiency, with the gas mass, gas accretion rate, and dust-to-gas ratio of the molecular clouds being secondary factors. We show that this model predicts a strong correlation between the DGR and the sSFR, and that this correlation is consistent with the assumption that the DGR is proportional to the accretion rate of gas onto the galaxy. We conclude that the DGR-sSFR relation does not imply that the DGR is proportional to the gas accretion rate. We suggest that the observed correlation is consistent with a model in which the DGR is set by the efficiency of star formation, and is therefore independent of the molecular gas accretion rate."}
{"text":"\nWe comment on a recent paper by Drovandi et al. (2019) in which a minimal size for barchan dunes is proposed. We point out that their definition of the minimal size is circular in nature and any attempt to produce a square or triangular dune would increase its perimeter and, consequently, its stable state perimeter-to-area ratio. Hence, the minimal size for barchan dunes cannot be of a particular shape. We show that the minimal size is related to the wavelength of the limiting undulation that can be imposed on the advancing edge of a barchan dune. We derive a simple expression for the wavelength of this limiting undulation for the case of steady state and uniform motion. The practical consequence of this result is that any effort to reduce the size of a barchan dune to a minimal value will result in a rapid increase in the height of the dune, thus making it unstable. We also derive a simple expression for the minimal perimeter-to-area ratio of a barchan dune. This result suggests that the minimal size for barchan dunes is not of a particular shape but rather is related to the desired perimeter-to-area ratio."}
{"text":"\n\nWe propose and analyze a simple model of planar grids and high-impedance surfaces comprising metal strips or patches. The model is based on the assumption that the surface-wave propagation speed is much higher than the speed of light. This assumption is valid when the grid period is much smaller than the wavelength. The model comprises a grounded conductor with a high-impedance surface in the form of a periodic array of metal patches placed in the same plane as the grounded conductor. The possible forms of the electric and magnetic responses of the structure are analyzed. It is shown that such a structure can be used to achieve a high-impedance surface with a bandwidth determined by the grid period and the thickness of the conductor. The structure can be used to design surface-wave resonators and filters with a high quality factor. We analyze the resonant modes of the system in the presence of a transverse magnetic field, which can be used to design a low-pass filter with a wide bandwidth."}
{"text":"\n\nWe suggest that the concept of photons and fermions be modified. In particular we suggest that the photon concept be replaced by the concept of a photonic quantum. We also suggest that the fermionic concept be replaced by the concept of a fermionic quantum. The photonic and fermionic quanta are in a way analogous to the energy quanta of quantum mechanics. The main difference is that the photonic and fermionic quanta are not Operators but rather ordinary objects, like for example the pointer of a pointer dial. We show that this change does not introduce any fundamental change in the structure of quantum mechanics, and that it can be consistently incorporated in the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics. The changes however has the advantage that it becomes possible to describe a far wider class of physical systems than what is possible with the traditional photon and fermionic concepts. In particular it becomes possible to describe situations where the concepts of a photonic or fermionic quantum are not adequate. We show how the suggested modifications can be used to describe situations where the traditional photon and fermionic concepts fail."}

{"text":"\nWe present a full-scale calculation of the hydrodynamic interactions in a dewetting contact line. The calculation is based on a three-dimensional (3D) representation of the fluid flow in the contact line, in contrast to the conventional two-dimensional (2D) description. We solve the 3D flow equation with the 3D contact line interface in a vertically averaged system. The resulting equation is a quasilinear elliptic equation with a singular boundary condition on the contact line. We solve this equation by an alternating direction implicit (ADI) method. To validate the calculation, we compare the results with those obtained from a 2D calculation. We find that the 3D calculation predicts a contact angle smaller than the one obtained from the 2D calculation. The difference between the 3D and 2D predictions increases with the ratio of the wetting layer thickness to the contact radius. Our 3D calculation also predicts a dewetting contact line velocity that is smaller than the one obtained from the 2D calculation. We discuss these differences and their physical origins."}
{"text":"\nWe show that the statistical interpretation of quantum mechanics can be obtained as a macrorealistic theory without recourse to the standard Copenhagen interpretation. We motivate the investigation by a simple example of a macrorealistic theory which is unable to describe the statistical behaviour of a simple quantum system.

We show that these generalised measures satisfy the axioms of a probability measure in the same way as the standard Copenhagen interpretation. We then show that this generalised statistical framework can be used to formulate a set of macrorealistic dynamics which can be used to describe the evolution of quantum states in a way which is consistent with the statistical data. We show further that this set of dynamics contains a special subset of dynamics which can be identified with the standard Copenhagen dynamics. We also show that the macrorealistic dynamics contains a number of further sets of dynamics which describe the evolution of quantum states in ways which are not consistent with the standard Copenhagen interpretation, but which are nonetheless compatible with the statistical data.

{"text":"\nWe have performed high-order coupled-cluster calculations for a number of quasi-one-dimensional Heisenberg antiferromagnets with long-range order, to investigate the effect of a large number of spins on the ground state. We find a number of interesting effects. The ground state of all the systems is a fully ordered chain, with a distinct ordering vector along the magnetic field direction. For the antiferromagnet on a square lattice with a magnetic field along the lattice vector, the ordering vector is found to be displaced by a quarter of a lattice vector, in a direction opposite to that of the magnetic field. The system is therefore in a state of magnetic frustration, and is believed to be close to a quantum spin-ice state. For the one-dimensional chains, we find a number of distinct magnetic states, including a number of new states with a partially ordered structure, in addition to the well known antiferromagnet and the spin-glass state. Our results suggest that the one-dimensional Heisenberg antiferromagnets are a very rich system, with a number of exotic states."}
{"text":"\nWe continue our study of the relaxation of a dewetting contact line (Part 1: Theory) by analyzing the experimental results of our previous work. We first confirm the theoretical prediction that the contact area decreases in a manner that is consistent with the contact line moving in a series of small jerks. We then show that the experimental data are consistent with the assumption that the distribution of the interfacial tension over the contact area is independent of the contact area itself. This allows us to evaluate the impact of the relative spatial distribution of the interfacial tension over the contact area on the dynamics of the contact line. We find that the assumption of a constant distribution of interfacial tension over the contact area results in a good qualitative description of the data, but the quantitative description is somewhat inaccurate. We then consider a more general model in which the distribution of interfacial tension over the contact area is allowed to vary in a prescribed way. We find that this model is able to provide a good quantitative description of the data."}

We derive a simple expression for the number of steps needed to generate a graph state with a given degree, and show that this number grows exponentially with the degree. We show that the graph state generation process can be equivalently viewed as the propagation of a signal along the edges of the graph, and derive a simple expression for the amplitude of this signal at each node of the graph. The proposed algorithm can be implemented using only local updates of the spin variables, which enables us to consider its application to distributed computing. We also show that the algorithm can be made fault-tolerant by using a suitable threshold parameter, and that this threshold can be chosen to optimize the trade-off between the quality of the generated graph state and the number of steps."}
{"text":"\nReconstruction of the Scalar-Tensor Lagrangian from a LCDM Background and Noether Symmetry\n\nWe present a method to reconstruct the scalar-tensor Lagrangian from a LCDM (late time dark matter) background and a noetherian action. The method consists in identifying the dark matter degrees of freedom with the Mandy imperfection and using the Euler-Heisenberg relations to extract the Lagrangian from the constraint generated by the noetherian action. The main application of this method is the construction of a symmetric scalar-tensor theory with a cosmological constant that generates the LCDM evolution. We show that the evolution generated by the resulting Lagrangian is equivalent to the evolution generated by the Einstein-Hilbert action plus a cosmological constant term. The resulting theory is well-defined and symmetrical under the Poincare group. We analyze the resulting theory by computing the energy-momentum tensor and find that it is well-defined and satisfy the weak energy conditions. As an application we show that the Einstein- Hilbert action plus a cosmological constant term is equivalent to the Nariai-Nadais action plus a cosmological constant term."}
{"text":"\n\nWe find a significant correlation between the accretion disc viscosity and the spin down rate of the black hole in the low-mass X-ray binaries. The inferred viscosity from the accretion disc spectral energy distribution and the spin down rate of the black hole are compared for a sample of black hole X-ray transient outbursts. We found that the two quantities are correlated in the sense that the higher the viscosity, the higher the spin down rate of the black hole, and vice versa. We find that this correlation has a small but non-zero standard deviation, which implies that there is a universal viscosity-spin down rate relation for low-mass X-ray binaries. Our results suggest that the accretion disc viscosity is the only physical quantity that determines the spin down rate of the black hole, and we can thus rule out several other physical mechanisms that were proposed to explain observations in this area. We also find that the spin down rate of the black hole does not depend on the accretion disc mass. Our results can be explained by a model in which the accretion disc viscosity is the only relevant parameter determining the spin down rate of the black hole. In this model, the inner disc is able to instantaneously adjust its viscosity to the total accretion disc mass, so that the spin down rate of the black hole depends only on the viscosity and not on the accretion disc mass. We discuss this model and its implications for a better understanding of the accretion disc dynamics in low-mass X-ray binaries."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present results of a targeted search for hyper-luminous infrared galaxies (HLIRGs) with the XMM-Newton Observatory. We have observed a sample of 18 galaxies drawn from the Hyper-luminous Infrared Galaxy (HLIRG) catalog of 1996, which contains galaxies with photometric redshifts in the range 1 < z < 3 and luminosities in the range 1012\u20131013 erg s\u22121. Our observations include the region of the sky around the galaxies in the sample in order to search for any galaxies which might be blending with the sources in the catalog. We find that 6 of the 18 galaxies in the sample are in fact blends of two or more galaxies, and that the non-blended galaxies in the sample have X-ray luminosities which are, on average, 1.5 times the photometric luminosity as given in the 1996 catalog. We determine the X-ray luminosities of the non-blended galaxies in the sample by fitting the XMM-Newton observations with modified absorption models, and we present the X-ray and optical luminosities of the non-blended galaxies in the sample, and their redshifts, in tabular form. We also present the results of an analysis of the X-ray spectral and temporal variations of the non-blended galaxies in the sample. From this analysis we are able to determine the gas temperatures and densities of the X-ray emitting gas in the galaxies, as well as the mass of the gas in the X-ray emitting regions. We find that the gas temperature and density are in good agreement with the values expected for gas in a simple exponential orbit around a supermassive black hole, and that the mass of the gas in the X-ray emitting regions is consistent with the gas being the infalling matter which will eventually accrete onto the black hole. We also find that the gas kinematics are consistent with the gas being drawn into the galaxy along the same trajectory, and that the gas is probably not being slingshotted out of the galaxy along a different trajectory, as had been suggested by previous X-ray observations of HLIRGs."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a new method, DNA hash pooling, which is based on the idea of using the DNA as a large, non-secret, one-way hash function. We show that under certain reasonable assumptions, the pools of DNA hashes are highly distinct and, therefore, can be used for the purposes of identification. The method has several advantages over existing methods. In particular, it does not require any assumptions about the number of dimensions of the DNA space. In addition, it does not require that the persons who donate their DNA for the creation of the pools be identified. We also present a statistical method for the estimation of the number of dimensions of the DNA space which is based on the analysis of the pools of DNA hashes. This method is more robust and more efficient than the existing ones. Finally, we show that our DNA hash pooling method can be used for the estimation of the distance between the DNA molecules in the DNA space and for the clustering of the molecules in the space. We also discuss possible applications of our method in the field of forensics."}
{"text":"\n\nWe study the structure and classification of (3+1)-dimensional superconformal nets, that is, certain types of Networks on 3-manifolds with a superconformal structure. We show that they are in 1:1 correspondence with (3+1)-dimensional posets, and that they fall into several classes, each of which is associated with a particular symmetry of the 3-manifold. We also construct a Classification Theorem for superconformal nets, in the sense that any (3+1)-dimensional superconformal net is isomorphic to an element of a particular class of superconformal nets, whose symmetry class is in 1:1 correspondence with the poset class of the net.\n\nWe also study the combinatorics of superconformal nets.

We also show that any (3+1)-dimensional superconformal net can be obtained by a certain rigidification process from a (3+1)-dimensional permutation group.\n\nFinally, we consider the (3+1)- and (2+1)-dimensional chiral subnets of a (3+1)-dimensional superconformal net, and show that they fall into several classes, each of which is associated with a particular symmetry of the 3-manifold."}
{"text":"\n\nA Logic of Reachable Patterns in Linked Data-Structures\n\nWe introduce a new framework for reasoning about reachability and containment in data structures such as trees and graphs. We focus on data structures that are formed by linking basic data structures together, such as linked lists, trees, and graphs. We present a logic that formalizes the intuitive notion of reachability in such structures. Our logic is founded on the basic principles of first-order logic, but includes new kinds of axioms and inference rules that capture important properties of linked data structures. For example, our logic includes an axiom that expresses the fact that a node in a linked list can be reached by repeatedly following the next pointers. As another example, our logic includes an inference rule that expresses the fact that if a node is reached by repeatedly following the children of a particular node, then that node is contained in a subtree rooted at that particular node. We show that our logic is sound and complete with respect to a suitable notion of model. We also show that our logic has several other desirable properties, such as the ability to represent and reason about operations that remove or add nodes to a data structure. We illustrate the use of our logic by formalizing several properties of linked lists, trees, and graphs that are commonly used in programming."}
{"text":"\nWe present evidence that the accretion disc in the neutron star X-ray binary RXTEJ1606 is followed by a strong, narrowly collimated jet, which is aligned with the disc's spin axis. The presence of the jet is revealed by a unique combination of high-resolution optical and near-infrared observations, made with the Hubble Space Telescope. The data show that the jet is responsible for the optical\/NIR transient that accompanied the disc's innermost accretion events. The properties of the jet are consistent with a steady, radially inward flow, driven by the disc's accretion pressure, and an energy flux that is estimated to be in the range 1\u2013100 keV. We conclude that a significant fraction of the disc's accretion energy is extracted by the jet, and that this process likely powers the system's X-ray emission. The existence of a jet in RXTEJ1606 implies that accretion disc instabilities may commonly drive matter on extreme Newtonian orbits, possibly leading to the formation of jets in many accreting X-ray binaries."}
{"text":"\nWe study the final state interaction effects in the semi-inclusive A(e,e'p)X processes on the deuteron and complex nuclei. We evaluate the amplitudes of the A(e,e'p)X final state interactions in the framework of the Random Phase Approximation (RPA) for the deuteron and thedoriated nuclei. We also evaluate the amplitudes of the final state interactions for the A(e,e'p)AX process in the framework of the Golden Mean Expansion (GME) for the deuteron and thedoriated nuclei. The large variation of the structure constants of the deuteron and thedoriated nuclei as well as the large variation of the amplitudes of the final state interactions in the A(e,e'p)X process for the deuteron and thedoriated nuclei can be explained by the large variation of the strength of the final state interactions for the A(e,e'p)X process. We found that the difference between the RPA and the GME results for the A(e,e'p)X process on the deuteron and thedoriated nuclei is small, and both methods give similar results for the amplitudes of the final state interactions in the A(e,e'p)X process. We also found that the final state interactions in the A(e,e'p)X process on the deuteron and thedoriated nuclei can be well described by a power-law function with a positive power. The obtained power-law function is consistent with the theoretical predictions based on the frameworks of the RPA and the GME."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider a particle orbiting a black hole in a background scalar field in 2+1 dimensions. We use numerical evolution to generate exact solutions to the resulting Einstein equations, and thereby to explore the structure of the classical vacuum spacetimes that result. We find that the solutions are sensitive to the initial conditions, in particular to the initial distance of the particle from the black hole, and to the strength of the field. For weak fields, the solutions are all conventionally described by a small number of parameter families which we analyze and discuss. For stronger fields, the solutions develop complicated structure, and eventually become multi-sheeted, with a large number of sheets. We show that this structure is in general not rotationally invariant, and we analyze the possibilities for symmetry in the final solution. We discuss the relation of our results to the classical Kerr-NUT-AdS metrics, and to the structure of the space-time fluctuations in the black hole\/ scalar field system."}
{"text":"\nWe present three-dimensional (3D) magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of the evolution of the magnetorotational instability (MRI) in a shearing box with zero net flux. The MRI evolution is driven by a large-scale field, taken from a synthetic mean field, that is inclined at an angle to the box symmetry directions. We study the impact of a small scale 3D structure on the large-scale field evolution. Our results show that, in general, the small-scale structure will be quickly amplified by the large-scale field, but in some cases the large-scale field will be damped. In all cases the small-scale field is not only amplified but also distorted. We find that this distortion is responsible for the damped large-scale field. In addition, the small-scale field may be amplified in a different direction from the initial one. We also find that in some cases the small-scale field may be damped if its initial amplitude is too large. We analyze the physical mechanism responsible for the damped large-scale field and the distorted small-scale field. We show that the linear theory of the MRI is not able to describe our results in general, but only in special cases. We analyze in detail one of these special cases. Finally, we discuss the issue of the numerical convergence of our simulations."}
{"text":"\nWe present three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of the evolution of the magnetorotational instability (MRI) in a shearing box with zero net flux. We study the effect of transport coefficients, such as the resistivity, the diffusivity, and the gyrotropy, on the growth of the MRI and on the evolution of the turbulence. We find that a finite resistivity does not prevent the growth of the MRI, as long as $\\dot\\varphi_0\\ll 1$. On the other hand, the finite diffusivity and gyrotropy have a strong effect on the evolution of the turbulence. In particular, we find that the turbulence is not affected by the gyrotropy when $\\dot\\varphi_0\\gg 1$. The slow-down of the turbulence evolution due to the finite diffusivity is more marked when $\\dot\\varphi_0\\gg 1$ than when $\\dot\\varphi_0\\ll 1$. We also find that the magnetic field is extremely sensitive to the presence of even small-scale turbulent fluctuations, and that such fluctuations can dramatically accelerate the evolution of the MRI."}
{"text":"\nWe present a systematic study of mode stability in delta Scuti stars, based on a comparison of numerical results from a linear analysis of the problem with observations of mode stability in open clusters. We derive a simple empirical criterion that is in good agreement with the observations, and we show that the commonly used parameter b\/R, which measures the mode stability, is not a good indicator of the evolutionary status of these stars. We find that the evolutionary state of a delta Scuti star, in particular the rotation period, is the main determining factor of mode stability. Our results indicate that slow rotators are very stable, while fast rotators are not. The observations are consistent with a simple model in which the mode stability is quenched when the rotation period is shorter than a critical value, which we derive. We also show that the mode stability is inversely proportional to the delta Scuti star's frequency discrepancy, that is, the difference between the frequencies of the oscillations in the star's atmosphere and the rotation. This is consistent with the idea that the mode instability is triggered by the frequency discrepancy."}
{"text":"\nWe present a new mechanism for the formation of the first stars in the universe based on the ionization of hydrogen and helium by ambient ultraviolet (UV) radiation and the subsequent formation of extended electric fields in the interstellar medium. We show that the electric fields can reach values in excess of 100 kV\/cm over interstellar clouds of gas and dust, sufficient to overcome the ionization balance and trigger a collapse to form stars. We explain that the ionization and field formation processes are driven by the continued cosmic ray (CR) flux from the early universe, which was recently shown to have been higher than previously thought. We evaluate the star formation rate (SFR) that can be triggered by the CR ionization mechanism, and show that it is consistent with the observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation and the observed SFRs in local galaxies. We further show that the distribution of the first stars is sensitive to the initial conditions in the ionization and field formation processes, and present a simple model for the distribution of the first stars. We explain that the CR ionization mechanism has important implications for the synthesis of heavy elements in the first stars, as it implies that the primordial gas was already partially ionized, and therefore the early stars had to form in environments with much higher metallicity than previously thought. We also discuss the possibility that the local galaxies were formed through a process of re-ionization of the gas clouds, triggered by supernova (SN) explosions in the early universe."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present photometric and spectroscopic observations of two quasars, QSOs J1439+0333 and J1507+0530, at z~4. The quasars have luminosities of L(H~0)~4-5 x 10^39 erg s^-1, which is several times lower than the typical luminosity of quasars at z~4-5. The low luminosity is accompanied by a large radiative transfer parameter, alpha~5, and a small error in the derived redshift, z_emen~3-5%. These quasars are thus the most distant known today. The observations were made with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA), and the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory (CSO). We find that the two quasars are uniquely different in their optical spectra. The spectrum of QSO J1439+0333 is featureless, with no evidence of strong broad absorption lines (BALs), despite a high redshift of 6.3. The only absorption feature is a narrow line at 4odia (1.9 kpc\/h), which is probably a foreground feature. We find that the spectrum can be described by a power law with a wavelength-dependent normalization, N(lambda)~lambda^-2.3. The spectrum of QSO J1507+0530 has, in addition to a possible foreground feature, a broad absorption line (BAL) at 6.5 kpc\/h, and a power law continuum with a different power law index than that of J1439+0333. We discuss various models that may produce the observed spectral diversity, and conclude that the most likely model involves an ionization structure with several zones along the line of sight. Our findings suggest that at z~4 the IGM is sufficiently inhomogeneous to produce the observed spectral diversity, in spite of the small statistical samples. We estimate the probability that a quasar at z~4 would have a spectrum similar to those of the quasars discovered so far, and find that this probability is ~30%. This suggests that the quasar population at z~4 is quite diverse."}
{"text":"\nWe propose and analyze a novel method for laser cooling of molecules that does not require a resonate cavity. Our scheme is based on the collective enhancement of light absorption in a multimode laser pulse. We show that such a scheme can be practically implemented with current technology, and that it has the potential to achieve the same cooling efficiency as a conventional laser cooling scheme. Our method has the additional advantage that it can be used to cool molecules that do not have a resonance frequency that is compatible with a laser cooling scheme. Our analysis also shows that the cooling efficiency is not very sensitive to the pulse duration, provided that it is long enough to allow a substantial number of absorption events. We show that the cooling efficiency depends on a dimensionless parameter that is related to the ratio of the pulse duration to the lifetime of the molecular state that is being cooled. Our scheme can be implemented with current technology, and has the potential to achieve the same cooling efficiency as a conventional laser cooling scheme."}
{"text":"\nWe present a detailed analysis of isophotal structure and dust distribution in 45 nearby (z < 1) radio-loud elliptical galaxies. We find that the dust distribution in these galaxies is extremely non-uniform, with the dust density in the central region being on average 3.5 orders of magnitude higher than in the outer parts of the galaxies. The isophotes in these galaxies are highly elongated, with the ratio of the length-to-width of the isophotes being 2.3 on average. We show that the shape of the isophotes can be described by a power law with an index of 3.6. The power law index is not correlated with any of the galaxy parameters we have measured, such as the mass, the radius, or the velocity dispersion, but is correlated with the structural parameters, such as the position of the centre, the elongation, and the surface brightness. We discuss our results in the framework of the cold dark matter theory and we show that the standard N-body models are capable of producing the observed distribution of galaxies, although a significant number of the model galaxies have to be perturbed by a smooth dark matter distribution in order to match the observed distribution."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a Bayesian analysis of the low-resolution polarized 3-year WMAP sky maps. We use a Gaussian process (GP) prior on the power spectrum, with the auto- and cross-power spectrum degrees of freedom as the only parameters. The posteriors on these parameters are computed using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, based on the Slice Sampler, that allows for efficient sampling from the posterior distribution. We show that the resulting posteriors are close to the ones obtained using the more extensive Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis presented in the WMAP paper. This is confirmed by a formal Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence calculation. The method also allows for an efficient computation of the likelihood function, which in this case is the ratio of the full-sky power to the power in a set of a priori defined large-scale structures. We use this likelihood function as a proxy for the secondary analysis described in the WMAP paper, which seeks to measure the B-mode in the power spectrum due to large-scale anisotropic structures in the sky. Our results are consistent with the secondary analysis of the WMAP paper, and thus in agreement with the conclusion that the large-scale anisotropic component in the power spectrum is likely to be generated by the cosmic microwave background itself, rather than by the galaxy distribution."}
{"text":"\n\nSubjective Information Measure and Rate Fidelity Theory: How Well Do They Describe Decision Making?\n\nWe present results of an empirical study of subjective information measures and rate fidelity theory as they apply to decision making under risk and uncertainty. We begin by reviewing the psychological research on decision making under risk and uncertainty and then discuss the major findings of our study. We conclude by considering the theoretical and practical implications of our results.\n\nDecisions concerning risk and uncertainty are prevalent in many domains, such as medical diagnosis, investment planning, and military strategy. Research on decision making under risk and uncertainty has been dominated by the assumption that decision makers are rational. The rationality assumption has been challenged by observations of decision making that appear to be based on intuitive or emotional processes. However, research on decision making under risk and uncertainty has also been influenced by two theories developed by psychologists: subjective information measure (SIM) theory and rate fidelity theory. Subjective information measures are self-generated scales that are used by decision makers to represent their beliefs about the probability of events. Rate fidelity theory specifies how people evaluate the probability of an event when a representative sample of events is presented.\n\nDespite their influence, previous research has not examined whether SIM and rate fidelity theory accurately describe decision making under risk and uncertainty. We present results of an empirical study of decision making under risk and uncertainty that tests whether SIM and rate fidelity theory are accurate descriptions of decision making. We found that both SIM and rate fidelity theory are moderately accurate descriptions of decision making under risk and uncertainty. We conclude by considering the theoretical and practical implications of our results and discuss avenues for future research."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider the dynamics of interacting Brownian particles in a viscous fluid, with an external driving force that may also be a Brownian motion. We develop a diagrammatic formulation of the problem in terms of a single master variable related to the average velocity of the particles. We then solve this formulation to obtain an analytical expression for the evolution of the master variable, which can be regarded as a 'hydrodynamic limit' of the dynamics of the system. The results obtained show that this formulation is capable of describing several different aspects of the dynamics of the system, and has several interesting and important applications. In particular, we show that a generalized Fisher information metric can be constructed from the solution of the master equation, and that this metric has a simple form in the limit of small Reynolds number. We also show that the master variable has a simple and general expression in terms of a kinetic energy, which is a generalization of the usual kinetic energy of the particles. This allows us to derive a generalized dynamics for the system, which includes a term that arises from the interaction between the particles, and which is an analog of the classical correlation function. We analyze this term and show that it has several interesting and important properties, which are related to the behavior of the system as a whole, rather than to the behavior of individual particles."}
{"text":"\n\nThe Baryon Fractions and Mass-to-Light Ratios of Early-Type Galaxies\n\nWe present baryon fraction and mass-to-light ratio measurements for galaxies in the local volume from the SDSS, and a comparison with the results from the 2MASS Redshift Survey. We find that the local baryon fraction is consistent with the value found in the 2MASS Redshift Survey, but the local M\/L is smaller than the value found in the 2MASS Redshift Survey by about 5%, suggesting that the local galaxies are more efficient in converting baryonic matter into non-baryonic matter. The mass-to-light ratios of the local galaxies are consistent with the simple relation, M\/L \u221d (M\/R)^(3\/2), where M\/R is the surface mass density profile, but the local M\/L is systematically smaller than the prediction based on the observed relationship by about 6%, suggesting that the local galaxies have higher concentrations of dark matter. We discuss these results in the context of the recent results of the SDSS MaNGA survey, which suggests that the M\/L of galaxies is well described by the M\/R^(3\/2) relation."}
{"text":"\n\nEnergy Transfer between Throats from a 10d Perspective\n\nWe have recently proposed a new theory of energy transfer between throats which has important consequences for the statistical mechanics of eternal inflation. In this paper we develop this theory from a 10d perspective. We show that energy transfer between throats is related to the Lovelock mechanism which is responsible for the transition from slow to fast expansion in the early universe. We show that the energy transfer is caused by the non-zero entanglement between throats which can be thought of as a type of \"loops\" in spacetime. We analyze the energy transfer in the limit where the number of throats goes to infinity and show that the energy distribution becomes thermal. We then derive the equilibrium statistics for the energy transfer between throats and show that it is described by a canonical ensemble. We also analyze the time dependence of the energy transfer and show that it is described by a stochastic process with a well-defined probability distribution. Finally, we discuss the practical implications of our results for the study of inflation and the early universe."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a study of the kinematic distribution of the sub-parsec young stars in the Galactic center, based on high-resolution spectroscopy of about 700 targets selected from the Hipparchus Catalogue of stellar objects. We aim to investigate the origin of the kinematic properties of these stars, which are, on average, rotating with a velocity higher than the majority of the Galactic disk stars, a feature that was previously explained by a statistical model assuming a correlation between the metallicity and the orbital velocity. In this work, we present a series of new estimates of the systemic velocity distribution, based on different selections from the Hipparchus data, which together cover a wide range of metallicities. We find that the metallicities and the orbital velocities are, in fact, uncorrelated, and that the velocity distribution can be explained by a single power law, with an index of about 1.5. This result suggests that the origin of the kinematic distribution of the Galactic center stars is dominated by a single physical mechanism, probably related to the gravitational interactions with the Galactic bar. We discuss this result in the framework of a simple model of dynamical friction, and we show that such a model is able to reproduce the velocity distribution of the Galactic center stars."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider the formation of harmonics in a cavity where an initially homogeneous distribution of standing waves is disrupted by a thin absorbing layer. We show that a critical power exists above which a transition takes place to a state in which the waves are perfectly uniform. Below this critical power, the number of non-zero harmonics is infinite. In this state, the least number of harmonics is given by the well-known expression for the case of a homogeneously filled cavity. The transition is related to a change in the spatial profile of the standing waves, in particular to a singularity that appears in the bulk of the medium. We show that such a transition is generic for any finite perturbation of the homogenous state, and can be understood from the zero-order approximation to the slowly-varying envelope approximation. We analyze the distribution of the harmonics in the transient regime, and show that the formation of the harmonic spectrum is governed by a simple probabilistic argument. We also discuss the case of a gradually-varying perturbation, and show that the distribution of harmonics in this case is given by a superposition of the harmonics associated with the two extreme cases."}
{"text":"\n\nWe investigate a model of non-Abelian criticality, which combines elements of the Pauli and fundamental variables models, beyond the framework of the Ginzburg-Landau-Wilson theory. The model exhibits a novel form of Fermionic \"quantum\" criticality, which stems from the collective activation of symmetry in the presence of a symmetry-breaking (SB) field. We show that such criticality can be understood as a special case of the lately proposed general framework for describing criticality in the presence of SB fields, which takes into account the specific features of the Fermionic symmetry. We demonstrate that the model is characterised by a rich variety of critical phenomena, which include the formation of a fractal spectrum of weakly bound states as well as a novel type of superconductivity with a non-zero threshold temperature. The critical behavior is accompanied by a number of universal features, such as the presence of a finite spectral gap and a strong enhancement of the pair breaking interaction as a function of the system's temperature. We also show that the model is extremely sensitive to the choice of the initial condition, which may lead to the formation of bound states in a finite spectral gap in the absence of a SB field. Our results may be relevant for the description of the critical behavior in strongly interacting quantum many-body systems."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present evidence of dark matter annihilations in the WMAP Haze. The large scale structure in the matter power spectrum observed by WMAP is consistent with a Universe dominated by a Gaussian random field with a scale of approximately 250 hMpc. We show that this is consistent with the location of the peak of the matter power spectrum being a transition between a Gaussian random field and a pixelated one, in a manner analogous to the transition between a Poisson and a binomial distribution. This has the implication that the small scale structure in the matter power spectrum may be described by a pixelated distribution with a scale of order 1 hMpc, and may thus be due to the annihilation of dark matter. We present a simple model which quantitatively describes the small scale structure in the matter power spectrum observed by WMAP, and find that it is consistent with a transition between a Gaussian random field and a pixelated one, with the scale of the pixelation being proportional to the average number density of dark matter. We discuss the implications of this model for the nature of dark matter."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a method, based on standard numerical-electromagnetism techniques, for computing the exact Casimir force between a perfect-conducting parallel-plate capacitor and a dielectric sphere in the presence of a homogeneous, isotropic, and static magnetic field. This method is exact, numerically stable, and does not require the introduction of any auxiliary fields. The computation of the Casimir force between the plates and the dielectric sphere is performed in imaginary time. The only input quantities that are computed in real time are the standard Greens functions for the electromagnetic fields in the spatial domain. The fact that the computation is performed in imaginary time does not mean that it is an approximate computation. Rather, it means that it is a exact computation that is obtained by integrating the relevant Green's functions in imaginary time. We show that the imaginary-time Greens functions for the electric and magnetic fields can be expressed in terms of the standard Greens functions for the fields in the spatial domain. This expression enables us to use standard numerical-electromagnetism techniques to compute the imaginary-time Greens functions. It also allows us to visualize the electromagnetic fields in the spatial domain and in imaginary time. We present a numerical example that illustrates our method."}
{"text":"\n\nMolecular gas in NUclei of GAlaxies (NUGA) VII. NGC4569, a large scale bar funnelling gas into the nuclear region\n\nWe present observations of molecular gas in the nuclear region of NGC4569, a barred spiral galaxy in which a large-scale bar is responsible for funneling gas into the nuclear region, in a fashion similar to that observed in NGC1365. We have imaged with milliarcsecond resolution, by means of Very Long Baseline Interferometry, the distribution of CO, COJ=1-0, and HCN in the nuclear region of NGC4569. We find that the molecular gas is distributed in a bar-like structure, with the bar being oriented at an angle of 30 deg with respect to the optical bar. The bar is covered by a layer of HCN J=1-0, with a peak abundance of log(OCN\/H2) = 1.05 +0.06\/-0.05. The distribution of molecular gas in the nuclear region is quite different in the two galaxies, reflecting the different processes taking place in the two galaxies. In particular, while the molecular gas in NGC1365 is distributed in a relatively smooth and roundly shaped structure, in NGC4569 the gas is distributed in a rather irregular fashion, with a large number of dense knots along the bar, and a tail of gas streaming out along the minor axis of the bar. We discuss the origin of these different distributions, in the framework of the \"bar-driven\" and \"dating\" scenarios for the evolution of molecular gas in galactic nuclei. We find that the models in their current form cannot produce molecular gas distributions as observed in both galaxies, in particular the distribution of HCN J=1-0 in NGC4569. We discuss the problems of the models, and suggest that the observed distributions of HCN J=1-0 in NGC4569 and in NGC1365 may be the result of different physical processes, taking place at different galactic scales."}
{"text":"\n\nVaporization and Layering of Alkanols at the Oil\/Water Interface\nWe have performed a molecular dynamics study of the evaporation of alkanols from the oil\/water interface. The effect of the water on the mobility of the alkyl chains of the surfactant molecules is negligible at the oil\/water interface for the alkanols with eight or more carbon atoms, but it is significant for the shorter alkanols. The mobility of the alkanol molecules at the oil\/water interface is much higher than that in the bulk oil, due to the weakened van der Waals interactions at the interface. The difference in the mobilities of the alkanol molecules in the oil and at the interface results in a layering of the alkanols at the oil\/water interface, with the more mobile alkanols in the top layer and the less mobile alkanols in the bottom layer. The averaged area per alkanol molecule, estimated from the molecular dynamics simulations, increases with the increasing length of the alkanol molecules. The increase of the area per molecule is due to the increased number of the van der Waals contacts with the oil and the water for the longer alkanols. The contact angles of the alkanols with the water are in the range of 72\u00b0-75\u00b0, independent of the chain length. The average number of water molecules around an alkanol molecule at the oil\/water interface is small, with an average of 1.8 water molecules per alkanol molecule."}
{"text":"\nWe describe an array of low-background $^3$He proportional counters for the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory. The array consists of eight $^3$He counters embedded in a $^4$He-saturated acrylic sphere of radius 55 cm. The counters are located at the nodes of a symmetrical eight-fold spherical octant division. Each counter is a $^3$He diffusion chamber with a volume of $\\sim 2.4$ litres. The chamber gas is contained in a cylindrical inner vessel made of glass or quartz, which is inserted into an outer vessel of PVC. The counters are instrumented with longitudinal and transverse resistive anode wires, and the number of pulses observed during a 3-minute sampling interval is recorded by a multichannel scaler. Each counter is surrounded by a thick layer of polyethylene foam to reduce the rate of $^3$He diffusion from the chamber. The array was designed to have good sensitivity to a point source anywhere in the sphere, while maintaining a small dead zone. We report on the construction, operation, and performance of the array."}
{"text":"\n\nWe propose and analyze a new resource for quantum information processors, which we dub \"incoherence\". Incoherence is the degree to which a quantum state is admixed with a large number of other quantum states. We show that incoherence can be usefully harnessed to enhance the quantum information processing capabilities of a processor. To this end, we propose a general framework for quantum information processors that combines several different kinds of quantum gates, including single-qubit gates, multi-qubit gates, and gates that harness incoherence. Within this framework, we show how a processor can be made to be \"incoherence-blind\", in the sense that it can achieve any single-qubit operation with high fidelity, regardless of the amount of incoherence in the qubit. We analyze a natural physical implementation of such a processor in terms of optomechanical systems. We show that such a processor can in fact be incoherence-blind, provided that the incoherence is sufficiently \"fast\". We also analyze the incoherence-blind processor from the perspective of quantum error correction theory, and show that the processor is able to correct errors resulting from both incoherence and from gate operations. As a by-product of our analysis, we also obtain a new method for approximately evaluating the energy cost of a quantum information processing circuit."}
{"text":"\nWe present observations of an unusually bright transient in the galaxy Messier 85. The event was first reported as a supernova by the robotic telescope Pan-STARRS1 on 17 March 2019, but with a much faster rise in brightness than a typical supernova. The source was quickly identified as a massive stellar flare, the first such event observed in another galaxy. We have carried out a multiwavelength observing campaign in order to investigate the origin and evolution of this event. Our observations show that the flare had a peak luminosity of ~1036 erg s\u22121, which makes it the brightest stellar flare observed in the universe so far. The observed rise in brightness was ~30 mag in ~10 days, which is more than three times faster than the rise in brightness of the most rapid supernovae. The light curve also shows a characteristic fast-cooled tail, with a duration of ~40 days, which is indicative of a thermal component to the emission. The observed transient has a systemic redshift of z = 1.66, which means that the light has taken ~48 million years to reach us. We find that the transient is located in a star-forming region of Messier 85, and that the host galaxy is a massive star-burst galaxy. We conclude that the transient is a massive stellar flare, possibly triggered by a three-body interaction in a close binary system. Our observations are consistent with a simple model in which the initial flare is followed by a prolonged cooling phase. We estimate the energy released in the flare to be ~1.3 \u00d7 1051 erg, which is more than a million times more energetic than the most energetic supernovae. This transient provides direct observational evidence that supermassive stars are able to flare on galactic scales."}
{"text":"\nWe consider the problem of constructing a Lagrangian system with a quadratic integral of the form:\n$$\\int \\frac{\\mathrm{d}t}{2} \\bigl[ 1 - \\dot{q}^2 \\bigr] = \\lambda \\int \\mathrm{d}q \\bigl[ 1 - \\dot{q}^2 \\bigr]$$\nfor some fixed $\\lambda > 0$. We construct such a system by adding a total time derivative to the standard free particle and relabelling the resulting Lagrangian. The main tool used is the fact that for any $\\gamma > 0$ we can find a smooth function $q^\\gamma$ with support in the positive half-plane such that $\\dot{q}^\\gamma = -1$ and $q^\\gamma = 1$ for $t > 0$. This construction can be considered as an example of a class of non-standard Lagrangian systems, which in some sense generalize the usual approach to constructing irreversible Lagrangian systems based on the addition of the total time derivative to the free particle. In particular, the approach developed here allows for a generalization of the concept of the attractor for such systems. As an application, we consider a two-dimensional system with the quadratic integral considered and show that the standard tools used in the theory of Lagrangian systems are applicable to non-standard systems as well."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate the possibility of a new type of explosion, driven by the spin-down of a white dwarf through the accretion-induced collapse (AIC) of a companion star, which results in a significant increase of the magnetic field in the white dwarf. Our main results are as follows. First, we show that such a magnetically-driven explosion is possible provided that the magnetic field of the white dwarf is not too strong (B < 4 MG) and the white dwarf is not too massive (M < 2 M\u2299). We determine the critical combination of the magnetic field and the white dwarf mass above which the magnetically-driven explosion is no longer possible. Second, we show that the magnetic field of the white dwarf can be amplified by the AIC, and that this process is more efficient for a less massive white dwarf. Third, we show that a significant portion of the magnetic energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the exploded white dwarf, which may be sufficient to drive the explosion. Our results suggest that a significant number of close white dwarf- companion star systems (B < 4 MG) may experience a magnetically-driven explosion as a result of the AIC, provided that the white dwarf is not too massive (M < 2 M\u2299)."}
{"text":"\n\nUncovering the Near-IR Dwarf Galaxy Population of the Coma Cluster with Spitzer IRAC\n\nWe present a sensitive search for near-infrared galaxies in the Coma Cluster with the Spitzer Space Telescope's IRAC camera. We have detected 46 galaxies in the cluster with MIRAC, a multiband imaging technique that combines data from the Spitzer Space Telescope's IRAC camera and a red filter from the WFC3\/UVIS instrument. We find that the Coma Cluster has a higher dwarf galaxy population than expected from the field, supporting the hypothesis that galaxies are removed from clusters as they merge. The MIRAC catalog includes the two brightest cluster galaxies, M99 and M100, and we find that these galaxies are optically bright in the infrared, which may be indicative of recent or ongoing starbursts. Our search also reveals many galaxies in the field that are not part of the Coma Cluster, but are instead background galaxies or galaxies in other clusters. We use the 8-band photometry from IRAC to separate the cluster galaxies from the field galaxies based on their colors, and use the half-light radius to classify each galaxy as a dwarf or a full-grown galaxy. We find that the Coma Cluster has many more dwarf galaxies than would be expected from the field, supporting the hypothesis that galaxies are removed from clusters as they merge."}
{"text":"\n\nPower-Efficient Direct-Voting Assurance for Data Fusion in Wireless Sensor Networks\n\nWe present a novel application of coding theory to wireless sensor networks that enables a fusion center to reconstruct fused data from a large number of sensors while achieving both energy and communication efficiency. Our technique uses erasure codes to reduce the communication overhead and to minimize the number of transmission repetitions in order to increase the lifetime of the network. We propose a simple randomization technique that allows our algorithm to achieve a direct-voting model, where each sensor sends its own data and then votes on the values received from the other sensors in order to determine the fused output. This technique achieves a higher resilience to failures compared to existing algorithms and provides a mechanism for sensors to discover the most reliable sensors to use as data sources. We implement our algorithm using off-the-shelf wireless devices and demonstrate its efficiency through simulations and experiments."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present an analysis of the distribution of the HI 21-cm line in a sample of 21 galaxies in which it has been previously detected. We focus on the behaviour of the wing of the HI 21-cm line, which contains information about the structure of the galaxy, the velocity field, and the distribution of gas. Our analysis comprises an integrated analysis of the galaxy velocity field, a comparison of the local velocity distribution in galaxies with and without bars, and an examination of the distribution of gas on galaxy-scale as traced by the HI 21-cm line. Our analysis reveals that in galaxies where the velocity field is described by a single Gauss-Hermite quadrature formula, the HI 21-cm line is only produced at a single velocity. In galaxies where the velocity field is described by two Gauss-Hermite quadrature formulas, the HI 21-cm line is produced at two velocities. In all cases the line is symmetrically distributed around the galaxies. We find that the velocity distribution of gas in the galaxies is well described by a two-components model in which the gas is travelling at two different velocities. This result suggests that the distribution of gas in galaxies is non-homogeneous and that the gas velocity in galaxies is not uniquely defined."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider the possibility of a non-Abelian internal symmetry group in supergravity theory, taking into account the assumptions on the form of the internal symmetry group axioms implied by theSweet Spot Theorem of Nicholas. In the case of a supersymmetric theory with an internal space-inversion symmetry group, we show that the theory can be obtained from a system with a pure Lorentzian signature and a non-Abelian internal symmetry group, in a fashion which preserves the basic properties of the theory, such as theivertical $SL(2,Z)$-invariant structure of the Poincare algebra, and the relation to the Twistor formalism. The main tool is a generalization of the Chromo-magnetic recipe to the case of a non-Abelian internal symmetry group. This generalization is achieved by introducing the concept of aNon-Abelian Poincare algebra. As an application, we consider the possibility of a $SL(2,Z)$-invariant internal structure for the recently proposed 11-D Polar Cosmology model, and show that it is possible to obtain such a structure by using the Twistor formalism."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a preliminary design and analysis for a possible SIM PlanetQuest Key Project that would combine archival and new observations of young stars with giant planet detectability surveys to establish the occurrence and frequency of gas giant planets around low-mass stars (M\u22c5<< 2M\u2299), including those that are not gravitationally bound. We would detect these planets via their transit signatures as they pass in front of their host stars. We analyze the yield of such a survey with respect to various planet occurrence rates, orbital parameters, star spectral types, and telescope aperture. We find that PlanetQuest-scale telescopes could detect dozens of gas giants in low-mass star systems with an occurrence rate as low as 5%. We present a sample of targets, including several dozen M dwarf stars that are known to host giant planets, for which archival data may already be available, as well as a sample of over 100 young stars in the solar neighborhood that could be surveyed with current technology. We show that the sensitivity of a survey to detect a given planet depends sensitively on the star's spectral type and planet orbital parameters, and discuss the implications of this survey for understanding planet formation, evolution, and atmospheres."}
{"text":"\n\nIntroduction:\nWhile most of the classical models of Hebbian learning are based on step-functions, we recently showed that a simple linear Hebbian learning model with a spontaneously active inhibitor can account for several types of synaptic plasticity, as well as for homeostatic regulation of synaptic strength. Here, we extend this model in several ways to account for even more types of synaptic plasticity, as well as for the spontaneous homeostasis of activity and connectivity.\nMethodology:\nWe used a simple linear Hebbian learning model, extended to include a spontaneously active inhibitor, to study the effects of three parameters on the synaptic strength and on the average activity. We used the Monte-Carlo method to perform a numerical investigation of the model in order to determine the synaptic weight and the average activity, in response to different input patterns.\nResults:\nWe found that the model can account for several types of synaptic plasticity, as well as for the spontaneous homeostasis of activity and connectivity. We also found that the model can be used to investigate the role of each component of the model (the inhibitor, the spontaneous synaptic plasticity and the Hebbian synaptic plasticity) in the dynamics of the system.\nConclusions:\nOur findings suggest that the spontaneous activity can play a major role in the dynamics of synaptic plasticity, and can lead to the spontaneous homeostasis of activity and connectivity. Our model can account for several types of synaptic plasticity, as well as for the spontaneous homeostasis of activity and connectivity, in a very simple way."}
{"text":"\nWe propose a new method to probe the polarization states of primordial gravitational waves by combining the data from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy and the large scale structure (LSS) surveys, which could potentially help to distinguish between different theories of primordial gravitational waves. The method is based on the fact that the CMB anisotropy and the LSS are both sensitive to the mass density fluctuations in the early universe, but they are sensitive to different scales, so that a model-independent measure of the correlation between the CMB anisotropy and the LSS can be used to probe the polarization states of primordial gravitational waves. We show that the proposed method is sensitive to the mass density fluctuations on the scales where the gravitational waves are expected to have a non-zero polarization, and it is not sensitive to the scale where the gravitational waves are completely depolarized. We also show that the method is model-independent, and it can distinguish between different theories of primordial gravitational waves with different cutoff scales for the gravitational waves. We find that the method can potentially rule out some of the currently popular theories of primordial gravitational waves, and could help to narrow down the range of the cutoff scale for the gravitational waves."}
{"text":"\nWe propose a new method for the experimental estimation of the fine-structure constant (\u03b1) and the proton-to-electron mass ratio (\u03b1e) that does not require knowledge of either the electron mass (m_(e)) or the proton mass (m_(p)). Our method is based on measuring the energy levels of the hydrogen atom, the so-called hydrogenic levels. We show that if the energy of the first hydrogenic level is measured with a high enough accuracy, \u03b1 and \u03b1e can be extracted from this measurement without knowledge of m_(e) and m_(p). We evaluate the accuracy with which \u03b1 and \u03b1e can be determined from a measurement of the first hydrogenic level, and we propose a method to measure this level with the required accuracy. Our proposed method requires a precise determination of the inverse square of the fine-structure constant, which can be obtained by measuring the molecular spectrum of hydrogen chloride (HCl). We show that a measurement of the HCl spectrum with an accuracy of $\\sim 1\\%$ can be used to determine \u03b1 and \u03b1e with an accuracy of $\\sim 1\\%$. We present an analysis of the experimental conditions that must be satisfied to measure the hydrogenic levels with the required accuracy, and we propose a method to measure these levels using a microwave cavity."}
{"text":"\n\nWe investigated the formation of soluble nanoparticles through the Coulombic interaction of bovine serum albumin (BSA) with anionic graft copolymers in aqueous solutions at low pH. The average particle size and the zeta potential of the nanoparticles were determined by dynamic light scattering (DLS), and the morphology of the nanoparticles was examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results showed that the nanoparticles formed through the Coulombic interaction of BSA with anionic graft copolymers were approximately spherical in shape, and the average particle size was less than 100 nm. The zeta potential of the nanoparticles was highly negative, which was attributed to the anionic groups on the surface of the nanoparticles. The results also showed that the morphology of the nanoparticles was uniform and that they were well dispersed in the solution. We conclude that the Coulombic interaction of BSA with anionic graft copolymers is a potential method for the formation of stable, soluble nanoparticles at low pH."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present observations of transient, extended dust in the nuclei of two elliptical galaxies (M106 and M31), obtained with the Spitzer Space Telescope as part of the Spitzer Infrared Extra-galactic Legacy Archive Survey. The dust clouds are detected in archival images from the Spitzer Deep Near-Infrared Extragalactic Survey, using a combination of thermal and Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) data. The dust clouds are absent in archival data from the Multiband Imaging Photometer for Spitzer (MIPS), which shows that they are not just out-of-focus clumps of dust in our own galaxy. The two galaxies are at similar redshifts (z ~ 1), but have different histories of accretion and feedback, with M106 having experienced several episodes of merging and M31 being more quiescent. The dust clouds are located in the cores of the galaxies, and have the appearance of discrete, non-rotating features that were perhaps released from molecular clouds and are now propagating through the galaxies. The M106 cloud is possibly a merger-driven event, while the M31 cloud is more consistent with a accretion-driven event. We discuss several mechanisms by which such clouds could be produced, and conclude that they are likely to be a manifestation of recent feedback energy release in the cores of galaxies."}
{"text":"\nWe present observations of the transient anomalous X-ray pulsar XTE J1810$-$197. We find that the accretion phase occurs in pulses, with a frequency that decreases by a factor of ~2 between each pulse. This suggests that the inner accretion disc is not being driven by a steady-state process, but is instead related to the orbital period of a companion. We determine the properties of the companion by fitting a simple model to the observations. We find that the companion has an orbital period of $\\sim$9 hours, which is consistent with a free oscillation period for a particle in the accretion disc, and an orbital decay of $\\sim$5.5 hours, which could be due to tidal interactions. The companion was likely captured by the primary star several thousand years ago. The simple model we use to describe the observations only includes the two fundamental orbital frequencies, but additional terms could be added to describe non-linear effects. We discuss the effect of the accretion disc viscosity on the observed phenomenology. The simple model is in good agreement with the observations, but a more complete model would be necessary to understand the underlying physical mechanism. We discuss how such a model might be constructed, based on the physical properties of the accretion disc and the companion."}
{"text":"\nAccurate X-ray position and multiwavelength observations of the isolated neutron star RBS 1774\n\nWe present photometric and spectroscopic observations of the isolated neutron star RBS 1774, which has been detected in X-rays by the Rossi-Rodriguez Binomial Search and in radio by the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA). We find that the X-ray and radio sources are the same, but the X-ray position is displaced by 55'' from the radio position. We show that this offset is explained by assuming that the X-ray source is the accretion disk around the neutron star, while the radio source is the unresolved scalar perturbation in the jet produced by the spinning neutron star. The observations are consistent with a jet pointed directly towards us, but slightly off-axis with respect to the disk. The disk's position is well described by the optical data, but the X-ray position is slightly offset from it, consistent with the disk's being slightly aspherical. We discuss the physical implications of these results, and the possibility of detecting such a misalignment in more detail with future observations."}
{"text":"\nZero-point radiation and the Big Bang: We show that a model of the early universe based on a small number of parameters can explain several features of the cosmic microwave background radiation in a simple and economical way, without the need to introduce ad-hoc modifications. In particular, it can explain why the background radiation is so close to the black-body spectrum, and why its intensity is so close to the minimum value allowed by the principle of conservation of energy. Our model predicts a non-monotonic evolution of the background radiation during the early universe, with a minimum around the time of the Big Bang, which is in agreement with observations. We also show that our model predicts a much smaller non-Gaussian component in the background radiation than conventional models, and that this component should have a specific structure which is in agreement with observations. Finally, our model predicts that the scale of the largest fluctuations in the background radiation should be proportional to the cube of the expansion factor, which is in agreement with observations. Our model therefore provides a simple and economical explanation for several features of the background radiation which have been difficult to explain using conventional models."}
{"text":"\nWe study a spatially extended phytoplankton-zooplankton system in the presence of additive noise and periodic forces. The system consists of a large population of phytoplankton, small in numbers but large in individual mass, and a large population of zooplankton, small in individual mass but large in numbers. We find the existence of two different kinds of spatial synchronization: one where the phytoplankton are synchronized in space and the zooplankton are not; and the other where the phytoplankton and the zooplankton are synchronized in space. We analyze the effect of noise on the system and find that noise can enhance spatial synchronization in some cases and suppress spatial synchronization in other cases. We also analyze the effect of a spatially periodic force on the system and find that the spatial period of the force can be different from the intrinsic spatial period of the system, and that a force can break spatial synchronization if its spatial period is sufficiently different from the intrinsic spatial period of the system."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present high angular resolution imaging of the circumstellar material around seven intermediate mass (IM) stars, three of which are pre-main sequence and the remaining four are on the main sequence. We aim to test the predictions of recent theoretical models that IM stars form by accretion of gas and dust onto the central object, in many ways similar to the accretion phase of low mass stars. We find that the accretion theory can explain the disk morphology around the young (pre-main sequence) IM stars but not around the main sequence stars. The main sequence stars, in contrast, show a significant difference in the disk structure compared to the pre-main sequence stars, with a well-defined inner disk around the main sequence stars, but a broken and diffused inner disk around the pre-main sequence stars. We discuss several possible explanations for the different morphologies, including a simple argument that the pre-main sequence disks are just smaller and hence more readily disrupted by turbulent disk motions. We also discuss a more exotic hypothesis that the disks around the main sequence stars are the remains of the disks around the pre-main sequence stars, and that the transition from a collapsing to an expanding gas is accompanied by a transition in the disk structure. We find that the simple models of accretion do not provide a good description of the disk structure around main sequence IM stars, and that more complex models that include the full evolution of the disk are needed to explain the observations."}
{"text":"\nWe determine the spectral gap for the Kac model with non-per capita basis functions for physical momentum conserving collisions. The motivation for this work is to understand the nature of the slow decay of the correlations in this model. The key idea is to use the basis functions to define an appropriate measure and to estimate the spectral gap by finding the distribution of this measure. The methodology is to use the path decomposition and the associated Fisher information to define the measure and to estimate the gap by the distribution of the measure. The main results are that the spectral gap is finite for a large class of basis functions and that the gap decays algebraically, inversely proportional to the number of basis functions. We show that this result is in contrast to the case of collisions conserving only the total momentum, where the spectral gap is infinite. In addition, we show that the finite gap implies that the slow decay of the correlations is a generic feature of the model. The problem this work attempts to solve is to understand the slow decay of the correlations in the Kac model for physical momentum conserving collisions. This work has important practical applications in understanding the statistics of physical systems in which the underlying dynamics is described by the Kac model. This includes all physical systems in which the dynamics is local and evolution is governed by the statistical properties of the system, such as statistical mechanics, critical phenomena, and even some aspects of quantum dynamics."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider a two-level system consisting of a qubit with a frequency-dependent transition rate and a cavity which can be in one of two states, each with a different quality factor and transition rate. The dynamics of the system is derived from the master equation and shown to exhibit a slow relaxation of the qubit towards its equilibrium value, in addition to an oscillatory dynamics due to the interference between the different paths the qubit can take. We find the regions of parameter space in which the system can reach a steady state and analyze the type of steady state it converges to. We also study the dependence of the dynamics on the initial conditions and find that, surprisingly, the final steady state is not very sensitive to the initial state, in spite of the fact that the qubit does not start from a uniform distribution. In addition, we find that a non-Markovian dynamics for the cavity can be achieved by driving the cavity at a frequency very close to the cavity's resonance frequency."}
{"text":"\n\nWe investigate the algorithmic complexity of several important problems related to planar graphs, including the classic planarity problem, the minimum degree problem, and the maximum independent set problem. We show that the fixed-parameter tractability of these problems is closely related to the integer vertebrate of the graph, a parameter that has been recently introduced by Jecroft and Rowley [JECROFT:2004] and that has been studied extensively by Buium and Larg McDonald [BUIUM:2006], and byPrices and Rodger [PRICES:2007]. Our main results can be stated as follows.\n\n- If the integer vertebrate of a graph is at most two, then the graph is planar.\n\n- If the integer vertebrate of a graph is at most two, then the minimum degree of the graph is at most two.\n\n- If the integer vertebrate of a graph is at most two, then the maximum independent set of the graph is at most two.\n\nWe show that the last two results can be obtained from the first one by using a rather natural bijection between graphs with a given integer vertebrate and the sets of vertices of a certain type in these graphs.

{"text":"\n\nWe investigate the habitability of super-Earths in Gliese 581. The Gliese 581 system is composed of three planets and one star. The inner most planet, Gliese 581e, is a super-Earth with a mass between Earth and Neptune. It is located in the star's habitable zone, where liquid water can exist on the planet's surface. We evaluate the habitability of Gliese 581e, and address the question of whether it is habitable. The super-Earth has a mass large enough to hold a thick atmosphere. Its mass is also large enough so that it is not tidally locked with its host star, which means that the same side of the planet always faces the star (in the same way that the same side of the Moon is always visible from Earth). We estimate the energy needed to heat the super-Earth's atmosphere to be in the range of 10^32 to 10^33 W, which is only a factor of a few larger than the solar flux it receives. We also estimate the emissivity of the super-Earth to be low, so that it can retain its atmosphere. We find that a super-Earth with a thick atmosphere, like the one in the Gliese 581 system, can be habitable."}
{"text":"\n\nA modified cable formalism for modeling neuronal membranes at high frequencies\n\nWe have developed a modified cable formalism that enables us to analyze the propagation of extracellularly applied electric fields in cables of arbitrary geometry, including cables that are terminated in neuronal membranes. Our formalism is based on a finite-element model of the cable and includes a dynamic model of the transmembrane potential in the neuronal membranes. We show that this formalism can be used to analyze the effects of geometry and spatial distributions of conductivities in cables on the extracellular signatures of neuronal membranes. In particular, we show that the cables can be treated as if all of their conducting elements were lumped together into a single element, as long as the frequency of the applied field is sufficiently high. We apply our formalism to study the extracellular signatures of cables that are terminated in neuronal membranes and that have complex geometries, and we show that these signatures can be obtained from the solution to a set of simple ordinary differential equations. We also show that our formalism can be used to investigate the effects of cable geometries on the transmission of extracellularly applied signals to the interiors of neuronal membranes."}
{"text":"\n\nWe investigate a class of generic non-relativistic theories which include the Dirac equation and the Gross-Pitaevskii equation as special cases. We show that the area law is respected in this class, providing a possible route to a generalisedarea theorem in non-relativistic theories. We consider the simplest case of these theories, which consists of a spin system with a two-dimensional harmonic oscillator potential. We show that in this case the area law can be derived directly from the traditional Dirac argument, and so our results are consistent with the standard Dirac area theorem. However, our generic theory is more general than the Dirac theory, and so it is possible to consider more complicated situations than those covered by Dirac's theory. We show that the area law still holds in these more complicated situations, but the way in which it is derived is different. In particular, the area law can fail to hold at a given point, but it always holds on a sufficiently small scale. We also show that the distillable entanglement is related to the area law in a generic way, and so our results can be used to obtain a generalised entanglement area law."}

{"text":"\nWe consider a solution of the parabolic scalar curvature equation with a time dependent boundary condition, which blows up in finite time.

The constant solution is obtained by the method of characteristics, the solution with the time dependent boundary condition by the method ofAssuming that the solution is regular in a neighborhood of the blow-up time, we obtain a formula for the blow-up time in terms of the solution data. The formula has a simple meaning if the solution is regarded as the solution of a Hamilton-Jacobi equation with a time dependent boundary condition. The blow-up time is given by the first time derivative of the solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. The assumption that the solution is regular in a neighborhood of the blow-up time is not necessary in our case. Indeed we show that the blow-up time can be obtained by solving a certain ODE, which is derived by the method of characteristics."}
{"text":"\n\nWe report on the investigation of superconductivity in MgB2 wires of different diameters, both in the as-grown, powder compact, and in the field-oriented state. The latter state is achieved by a combination of magnetic field applied during the wire drawing and subsequent alignment of the magnetic field by a procedure of melt spinning in a rotating magnetic field. We find that in all wires the superconducting properties are enhanced by the magnetic field, most likely due to the anisotropic effect of the magnetic field on the electronic and\/or spin degrees of freedom. In particular, we observe a significant drop in the critical current density, as well as in the zero field transition temperature, for transverse transport, while the longitudinal transport is much less affected. The in-field properties of the wires are found to be excellent, with a large critical field and a good retention of the superconducting properties at low temperatures.\n\nThe observed critical current fluctuations are interpreted in the framework of a model of superconductivity with a strong anisotropic coupling to the electronic degrees of freedom, in combination with a thermal engine which produces the critical current density. The anisotropic coupling also naturally explains the strong temperature dependence of the critical current density. We also discuss the possibility that the critical current fluctuations are directly related to the anisotropic interaction of the superconductivity with the magnetic field."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present photospheric photometry and spectroscopy of a solar pore with a light bridge, obtained with the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and a ground-based magnetic spectrometer at the vacuum tower of NASA's Langley Research Center. The photospheric magnetic field, traced by the photospheric hydrogen alpha index, is characterized by a series of small-scale structures in the leading upflow, the so-called dragon's teeth, and a large-scale arc-shaped structure in the wake, the so-called arcade. The arcade is a continuation of the leading-edge dragon's teeth. We find that the magnetic field in the bridge region is approximately aligned with the arcade and has a substantial parallel component. The bridge is also characterized by a large-scale streamline pattern. The streamline pattern and the magnetic field configuration in the bridge suggest that the arcade is the signature of the magnetic field constraint imposed by the light bridge. We also find that the two-ribbon structure in the light bridge is likely due to the superposition of the boundary layer and the plume driven by the Shearleigh-Taylor instability."}
{"text":"\nWe present a model of the extragalactic gamma-ray background (EGB) based on a parameterization of the observed spatial distribution of BL Lacertae objects. We find that a contribution of 4.2 kpc^2 from BL Lac objects is sufficient to explain the observed EGB, and we show that this is consistent with the simplest possible model in which BL Lac objects are the only population of extragalactic gamma-ray sources. We propose that BL Lac objects contribute to the EGB through a combination of (i) anisotropic diffusion of gamma rays in the intergalactic medium and (ii) a source distribution that peaks at the same scale as the EGB. We show that this model naturally explains why the EGB is nearly isotropic, despite the fact that the distribution of BL Lac objects is highly anisotropic. This model requires that the magnetic field in the BL Lac objects be less than about 1 kG, in agreement with observations. We find that this model predicts a correlation between the EGB and the large-scale structure of the Universe, and we present observations that are consistent with this prediction. We show that this model has several testable predictions, and we discuss prospects for testing these predictions with current and future gamma-ray telescopes."}

{"text":"\nWe develop a notion of the foundations of thermodynamics, as a subdiscipline of the foundations of physics, and identify and characterize the sources of its empirical content. A key idea is that a strict separation between the formulation of a theory and its empirical content is untenable, unless one resorts to the often encountered expedient of adopting a minimalist 'theory of the bare essentials'. We argue that a more illuminating approach is to consider the extent to which the choice of the theoretical formulation influences the empirical content. In this way we make a clear distinction between the foundation of a theory and its various ramifications. We show that the choice of a thermodynamic formalism is not entirely free, but is constrained by the requirement that it should be capable of incorporating a certain minimal empirical content, without which the theory would be sterile and uninteresting. We consider the three most prominent thermodynamic formalisms\u2014the Gibbs-Duhem, the Einstein-B\u00fcchi, and the Van't Hoff-Margenau formalisms\u2014and show that they are all capable of incorporating the minimal empirical content. The choice among them is thus a matter of convenience and personal preference, influenced by the other commitments one has already made in the course of one's scientific development. We also discuss the status of a number of relatively recent innovations in thermodynamics, such as the definition of entropy in terms of the number of microstates, the definition of a 'system' in terms of its boundaries, and the use of the term 'statistical thermodynamics'."}

The member stars are at a wide range of distances from us, so the association can be used to study how the properties of stars change as you look closer and closer. We present here the first reliable distance measurements for Orion KL, using the VERA galaxy redshift survey. We find that the distance to Orion KL is 745 pc, with an uncertainty of 21 pc. This is a significant improvement over previous distance estimates, which had much larger uncertainties. We also find that the distance to the subgroup Orion B is 650 pc, with an uncertainty of 12 pc.\n\nWe can use these distances to estimate the absolute magnitude of the member stars. We find that the absolute magnitude of Orion KL is -0.7 \u00b1 0.2 mag, and the absolute magnitude of Orion B is -0.6 \u00b1 0.2 mag. We can also use these distances to estimate the ages of the member stars.

This peak is related to the dynamicCasimir-Lifshitz force, and can be used to measure its strength. Our technique is independent of the specific material properties of the fluid and the membrane, and can be used to measure the Casimir-Lifshitz force in any fluid-membrane system.\nWe demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique by measuring the dynamic Casimir-Lifshitz force in a fluid consisting of diluted magnetic microparticles suspended in a non-magnetic fluid.

Our results suggest that the dynamic Casimir-Lifshitz force may be a useful tool for studying the properties of complex fluids."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider the cosmological implications of modified Gauss-Bonnet gravity, a generalization of general relativity which introduces a new coupling term between the spacetime curvature and a dynamical, time-dependent vector field. The curvature-vector coupling can be related to the concepts of torsion and spin, leading to a rather different picture of the structure of spacetime compared to the standard theory. We show that the main effect of the new coupling term is to generate a bulk viscosity, which acts to oppose the formation of large-scale structure and hence tends to smooth out any existing structure. We evaluate the strength of this bulk viscosity and find that it is sufficient to prevent the formation of structure on scales much larger than the Planck scale. Therefore, we conclude that modified Gauss-Bonnet gravity is cosmologically relevant only in the limit in which the structure is very small, which is inconsistent with the observation of a very large scale structure in the Universe."}

{"text":"\n\nWe present Spitzer\/IRS imaging and spectroscopy of the luminous infrared galaxy NGC 6052 (Mrk 297). This galaxy is a member of the Leo VII molecular cloud and is a member of the Sco association. The aim of our investigation is to study the ionization structure and the distribution of young stars in the ionization structure in order to get information on the star formation history in this galaxy. Our main results can be summarized as follows. We have identified three ionization zones in the galaxy, with ionization ratios of 1-2, 2-3 and 3-4. The most extended ionization structure has a ratio of 3-4 and is mainly located in the outer part of the galaxy. The ionization structure with a ratio of 2-3 is much more compact and is centered on the optical nucleus. We have compared our results with those obtained from a similar study of the ionization structure in the nearby galaxy NGC 6 arterial 6888. The differences in ionization structure and the relative numbers of young stars in the two galaxies suggest that the star formation in the inner part of NGC 6052 has been more or less continuous since the ionization structure was formed, while the star formation in NGC 6288 has been more episodic. We have also compared the results with the predictions from a simple model of the ionization structure formation and evolution. The agreement between the model and the observations is reasonable, but the model under predicts the ionization ratio in the inner part of the ionization structure in NGC 6052. We discuss this model and suggest a possible explanation for this discrepancy."}

These sources are thought to be closely associated with the Cygnus OB2 association, a group of young, hot, and massive stars that is the dominant member of the Cygnus-Aquila association. We find that the radio sources are distributed along the eastern boundary of the Cygnus OB2 association, in the direction of the expected encounter between the Local Bubble and the Cygnus-Aquila association. The sources are distributed in a chain, with a northeastern source (HEGRA 1) that is relatively nearby, a southwestern source (HEGRA 2) that is relatively far away, and several sources in between. The chain of sources is aligned along the projection of the streamers of the Cygnus-Aquila association. We show that the distribution of the sources is consistent with the expectation that the HEGRA sources are slightly older than the Whipple sources, as the Whipple sources are more closely associated with the youngest stars in the Cygnus OB2 association.

{"text":"\n\nWe establish a hypercontractive inequality for matrix-valued functions. The inequality provides an approximation algorithm for solving a general class of symmetric semi-definite programming (SDP) problems, which includes several important subclasses of SDPs as special cases. The method is based on the technique of iteratively producing more accurate approximate solutions, until the error is small enough that the inequality is satisfied to within a prescribed accuracy tolerance. The basic tool is an SDP relaxation of the original problem, which can be solved using an interior point method. We show that this technique can be made to converge rapidly, in a number of steps that is proportional to the matrix dimensions of the SDP. The hypercontractive inequality also has important implications for the study of lower and upper semicircular laws in quantum computing and for learning theory in the setting of low-degree compositions (LDCs). As an application, we show that the inequality can be used to obtain an easy-to-check sufficient condition for a family of quantum gates to implement a given quantum algorithm."}
{"text":"\n\nWe have recently proposed a scenario which provides a possible physical interpretation to the confiningcolour-flavor-locked quark-anti-quark pair in N=1 SQCD. Our scenario contains two distinguishable confinements, which we called weak and strong. The weak confinement is related to the strong one by a Seiberg-like duality, but the two confinements have different masses. The strong confinement has the same mass as the original quark-antiquark pair, while the weak one is lighter. We show that our scenario is consistent with the quark-antiquark pair being the weak confinement and the antiquark-antiquark pair being the strong one, as long as the weak confinement is very light compared to the strong one. In this case the non-relativistic effective Lagrangian of the weak confinement can be approximately given by a well-known Bethe-Salpeter-like formula. In this paper we study this scenario further, and in particular we show that it is possible to have a good description of the strong confinement, by regarding it as a non-relativistic QCD sum rule. We show that such a description is possible provided that the weak confinement is at least as light as the quark-antiquark pair, and that the strong confinement is sufficiently light to be described by a QCD sum rule which contains only a small number of quark and antiquark flavours. We find that the strong confinement is in fact much lighter than this minimal mass, and therefore can be described by the sum rule. We also comment on the possible physical interpretation of the confinements in terms of the idea of local quark-antiquark pairs, which was introduced by curve fitting the mass distribution of the confinements in the original paper."}
{"text":"\nWe present a measurement of the atmospheric muon charge ratio at high energies using MINOS. The measurement was performed with a total exposure of 1.56 \u00d7 10\u2076 protons on target.

The problem is related to the following question: what is the statistical distribution of a quasiparticle which is prepared in an excited state and then allowed to evolve \"freely\" in the many-body basis? We solve the problem exactly for a range of model parameters and find that the quasiparticle does not always evolve according to the Boltzmann distribution. We also find that a subtlety of the \"freedom\" of the evolution is that the quasiparticle may not always keep its identity and can be absorbed by the many-body basis. The findings are relevant for a deeper understanding of the dynamics of quasi-particles in many-body systems."}

{"text":"\nWe present a matched filtering technique to extract the information encoded in the nutation signatures of spinning black holes from numerical relativity templates. Matched filtering is a powerful tool that has been successfully applied to extract signals from noise in various fields such as astronomical imaging and seismology.

The extracted frequencies can be compared with the known frequencies of the spins to test the consistency of the template and to extract the information encoded in the residual frequencies. We show that, despite the large pixelization in the templates, the matched filtering technique extracts the frequencies of the spins with high precision. We also analyze the statistical significance of the extracted frequencies. We show that the frequency distribution of the residuals can be used to constrain the form of the potential function used to generate the templates. We discuss the application of this technique to extract the frequencies of spins in full general relativity, where the templates are not constrained by any potential function."}
{"text":"\nWe consider a model of oscillating sources of neutrinos in a homogeneous and isotropic medium, with an emphasis on the dynamics of the supernova (SN) neutrino signal. The supernova (SN) neutrino burst contains valuable information on the interior structure and evolution of the SN, and thus has been studied extensively. However, most of the analyses have been made for a static and spherically symmetric neutrino source, which is not a good description of the SN, especially during the early phase of the evolution. We have developed a generalised model which takes into account the three-dimensional structure of the source, the finite duration of the neutrino burst, and the possible non-linearity of the evolution. We solve the resulting system of equations analytically, and show that the oscillations in the source give rise to significant and characteristic modulations in the neutrino signal. In particular, we find that if the periods of the oscillations are sufficiently long, the neutrino flux is very similar to the static case, except for a small, but non-zero, decorrelation length. We also derive a simple expression for the time variation of the neutrino flux, which contains the significant harmonics of the neutrino oscillations."}

Within this framework we show that the competition between the anisotropic and isotropic pairing is a possible mechanism for the emergence of a  unidirectional spin order, such as the d-wave symmetry. In this way we suggest a possible microscopic origin of the d-wave duality in terms of the two competing symmetries, the chiral and the vector, in the cuprate superconductors.

The lowest metallicity measured in our sample is 12+log(O\/H) > 7.06, close to the minimum metallicity found in local galaxies.

This distortion is a general feature of realistic warped space models, and is not related to any particular theory of gravity.

{"text":"\n\nThe SN 1987A Link to Gamma-Ray Bursts\n\nWe present a model for the origin of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) based on the analysis of a large number of observations of the SN 1987A supernova. Our model requires that the GRBs are due to the interaction of the shock wave from the supernova with the circumstellar matter. We show that the observed correlation between the optical light curve and the time evolution of the circumburst emission in gamma rays is consistent with this model, provided that the bursty emission has a simple power law decay with an exponential cut-off. We show that the observed correlation is inconsistent with the idea that the bursty gamma rays are due to the interaction of the shock wave with the ISM (interstellar medium) or with a large scale magnetic field. We show that our model can explain several aspects of the GRB phenomenon not previously explained, such as the relation between the burst rate and the ambient magnetic field, the observations of 'soft' gamma rays in some bursts, the relation between the energy of the burst and the energy of the optical light curve of the supernova, and the presence of a spectral peak at about 1 keV in some bursts. Our model predicts that bursts should occur preferentially in binaries with a large ratio between the mass of the donor star and the mass of the compact object, which is consistent with observations. We show that the energy released in a burst is on the order of 10^36 erg, which is about a factor 10^2 larger than the energy released in the subsequent supernova explosion. We discuss the physical mechanism that can produce this extraordinary energy release, and the relation with the general theory of relativity."}

These data were obtained with the VLBA and EVLA in the hope of detecting a supernova in the very earliest stages of evolution.

The source was clearly detected in both the VLBA and EVLA data, but the images are heavily affected by RFI. The supernova is resolved in the VLBA data, but the EVLA image is too contaminated by RFI to be useful. We find that the supernova has a brightness temperature of about 5 keV, corresponding to an energy release of 4 x 10^36 erg s^-1. The brightness temperature is almost constant on a timescale of hours, but the supernova is evolving on a timescale of days. We find that the supernova is likely to be a member of the TN 1991ea-like class of supernovae. The lack of a well-defined point source in the EVLA data is consistent with the supernova being surrounded by a shell of expanding material, as has been observed in several other TN 1991ea-like supernoves at later times."}
{"text":"\nWe have carried out a systematic study of the hadronic emission from twenty-eight supernova remnants, all of which have had their electron temperature measured with Si-PIN or Silicon-On-Sapphire (SOS) detectors. We find a strong correlation (r=0.67) between the hadronic energy and the electron temperature, in agreement with the predictions of the simple hadron-holder model. We show that the hadronic contribution to the total flux is on the order of 10-30%, depending on the energy range considered and the Remnant Spectral Index (RSI). The hadronic part of the energy spectrum can be described by two power laws, with indices of 1.6 and 2.3. The higher energy part of the hadronic spectrum shows an excess of emission with respect to the simple hadron-holder model, which we attribute to the presence of highly relativistic electrons. We find that the hadronic contribution to the total energy flux is positive for all but four of the remnants, in qualitative agreement with the result obtained from a study of the X-ray emission, where a negative contribution was found for the same remnants. We discuss the relevance of our results for the interpretation of the non-thermal emission from supernova remnants, and we point out that hadronic emission is probably the dominant source of non-thermal radio emission in the low frequency regime ("}

The measured albedo is 1.88 \u00b1 0.07 h Fallout-Uranium, in agreement with model predictions.

We also found that the concentration of radioactive potassium is higher in high- altitude areas, which is consistent with volcanic outgassing. Our results imply that the average lunar surface particle is 2.4% less radioactive than the Earth's average meteorite, which contains 1.5% uranium.

We find that the data are consistent with a simple description in which the number of particles produced is proportional to the energy deposited in the particle maker, with a scale factor that depends only on the hadron energy and the number of constituent quarks. This is consistent with the idea that the particles are produced by quark-antiquark pairs that are created with a probability that depends only on the hadron energy and the number of constituent quarks. This is in contrast to the situation at lower energies, where the systematics of particle production has a strong dependence on the hadron momenta and on the number of constituent quarks. We show that this simple description of the systematics of particle production can be used to extract the average energy deposited in the particle maker by each constituent quark, independently of the number of constituent quarks. We find that the energy deposited by each constituent quark is consistent with the quark-antiquark pair production cross section, as expected from the quark- antiquark pair-to-particle conversion probability. We also show that the systematics of soft particle production at RHIC energies can be used to constrain the shape of the distribution of quark-antiquark pair production cross sections as a function of hadron energy, and we discuss the implications of our results for the study of quarkonia."}
{"text":"\n\nWe propose and analyze a novel concept of inductively coupled circuits with a spin wave bus for information processing. Our scheme is based on the combination of the concepts of circuits, buses, and spin waves. A circuit is a functional unit that can perform a set of basic operations. A bus is a set of wires through which multiple functional units can communicate with each other. A spin wave is a type of electromagnetic wave which is formed when a spin-polarized current is introduced in a magnetic nanowire. We show that by using the concept of inductively coupled circuits with a spin wave bus, a new type of information processing system can be realized. Our proposed system is able to perform various types of basic operations which are required for information processing. We also analyze the power consumption of our proposed system. Our proposed scheme has a number of advantages over the conventional systems. It has the potential to provide a higher speed, lower power consumption, and a higher degree of integration."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a Chandra archival study of the temperature and metal abundance profiles in hot Galaxy Clusters at 0.1 < z < 0.3. We aim to test the accuracy of the neglecting the chemical composition effect on the observed X-ray surface brightness of clusters in computing the gas temperature, and to investigate the role of gas metallicity in the evolution of clusters. We find that the gas temperature and metallicity are well described by a two-component function, with the metallic component rising in the clusters with increasing temperature and metallicity, and the gas component declining with increasing metallicity. We show that a simple chemical model in which the gas metallicity is set to be equal to that of the stars in the cluster galaxies can quantitatively reproduce the observed correlation of cluster gas temperature and metallicity, thus strongly supporting the scenario in which the evolution of the cluster gas is regulated by the metallicity of gas accreting from the intergalactic medium. We further show that the gas temperature and metallicity profiles in clusters are consistent with the predictions based on the simple chemical model, suggesting that the chemical evolution of clusters is relatively well described by the simple model. We also discuss the implication of our findings on the role of gas metallicity in the evolution of clusters."}
{"text":"\n\nWe investigate thermoelectric effects in a strongly correlated model for Na$_x$CoO$_2$ by means of ab initio calculations. We consider both the Seebeck and the Peltier effect and study the temperature dependence of the corresponding coefficients. The model we use is a variant of the nearly free electron model which includes a small parameter $\\Delta$ which leads to a finite gap $\\Delta\\Delta\\sim \\Delta_{\\mathrm{F}}$ at the Fermi level. We determine $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{F}}$ by fitting the electronic specific heat and find $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{F}}\\sim 30\\, \\mathrm{meV}$.

For $\\lambda\\sim 10\\, \\mathrm{eV}$ the Seebeck coefficient is positive for all temperatures, while it is negative for $\\lambda\\sim 30\\, \\mathrm{eV}$. The sign of the Peltier coefficient changes with increasing temperature in the same way. We discuss the physical reasons for these results in terms of the band structure and the spatial distribution of the electrons."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider a generalization of finite state machines to discrete event control systems with an infinite number of states. The concepts of supervisory and behavioral layer are introduced in order to model the system structure in a modular fashion. The behavior of the system is described by a set of finite state machines that are executed concurrently. We show how to define the set of valid behaviors of the system in a way that allows for the representation of systems with complex, possibly non- monotonically executed transitions. The notion of relative level of activation is introduced in order to differentiate between active and inactive behaviors. The behavior of the system is changed by means of a supervisory layer that sends discrete events to the behavioral layer.

The synthesis method is based on a depth-first search strategy and the computation of a suitable value for the level of activation."}
{"text":"\nWe present a first-principles model of early evolution, based on the idea that the information encoded in the genome is sufficient to determine the folds of the encoded proteins. We show that this model can generate the main features of early evolution, such as the emergence of gene families, species and preferred protein folds. The model is implemented using a combination of a simple genetic algorithm and a non-equilibrium statistical mechanics framework. The main parameter of the model is the mutation rate, which can be either constant or varied according to a probability distribution. We vary this parameter and study the effect on the evolutionary dynamics. We find that the choice of the mutation rate has a major impact on the evolution of the system, and that two different modes of evolution can be identified, depending on whether the mutation rate is low or high. When the mutation rate is low, the model generates a slow evolution towards a global optimum, characterized by the presence of preferred protein folds and the evolution of gene families. When the mutation rate is high, the model generates a rapid evolution, leading to a population in which the appearance of new folds is more likely. We discuss the biological relevance of our findings, and in particular the hypothesis that the evolution of gene families may be linked to the emergence of preferred protein folds."}
{"text":"\n\nWe study generic black holes in de Sitter spaces. We find two different classes of anomalies. One of them is a result of a local coordinate singularity, and the other is due to the dynamical Casimir effect. The first class of anomalies is eliminated by a change of the coordinate system, while the second one is only partially eliminated and results in a finite thermal mass flux for the black hole. We show that this non-zero mass flux is a result of a special form of the black hole horizon, which is different from the standard round horizon but still allows the black hole to be stable against any perturbations. The physical origin of this special form of the horizon is a strong gravitational interaction between the black hole and the space-time. We show that this interaction is a result of the de Sitter space-time being curved. We call this type of a black hole a de Sitter black hole. It has a finite temperature and a non-zero mass flux. We discuss a physical origin of the de Sitter black hole and show that it is a result of a particular form of the Einstein equations in the de Sitter space-time.\n\nWe also discuss a possibility of a detection of the de Sitter radiation from the de Sitter black hole and show that it is different from the Hawking radiation. The de Sitter radiation is a result of a periodic transient in the dipole moment of the black hole, which is caused by the periodically changing structure of the space-time. We show that this transient is related to a modulation of the Einstein equations and can be induced by a change in the radius of the de Sitter space-time. We calculate the energy flux of the de Sitter radiation and show that it is a very small fraction of the Hawking radiation for any reasonable choice of the de Sitter space-time. We also discuss a possibility of an experimental detection of the de Sitter radiation."}
{"text":"\nWe present an overview of our recent work on the in-plane structure and ordering at liquid sodium surfaces and interfaces, based on large-scale ab initio molecular dynamics simulations.

We have found that the behavior of liquid sodium is very sensitive to the details of the interfacial interaction, with different types of ordering behavior resulting from different interfacial interactions. We have also found that the nature of the ordering at the interface is very sensitive to the details of the electronic structure of the interface, with different types of electronic structure resulting in different types of ordering behavior.

{"text":"\nWe present a theory of the catastrophic eruption of a magnetic flux rope in the corona and solar wind, with and without magnetic reconnection. The theory is based on the idea that the energy stored in the winding up of the magnetic flux rope is the main energy source for the eruption. We show that the evolution of the magnetic flux rope is different in the presence and absence of a guide field. In the absence of a guide field, the magnetic flux rope can be unstable against a large-scale eruption even in the quiescent state, which is in disagreement with the observation. In the presence of a guide field, the magnetic flux rope is stable in the quiescent state but can be triggered to a large-scale eruption by a small-scale instability. The different evolution of the magnetic flux rope in the presence and absence of a guide field can be explained by the difference of the energy budget. We also investigate the influence of the resistivity on the evolution of the magnetic flux rope. A high resistivity tends to increase the energy stored in the magnetic flux rope and therefore enhances the possibility for a large-scale eruption.\n\nWe thank T. bundles for helpful discussions.

{"text":"\n\nWe present a detailed kinetic analysis of the energy release in the formation of coronal mass ejections (CMEs). We consider two energy release processes: the magnetic reconnection and the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) catastrophe. We evaluate the energy released in the form of particle kinetic energy and in the form of thermal energy. We solve the resistive magnetohydrodynamic equations with the help of the Wissink-Olive model for the density and the glorified k-Ohm's law for the resistivity. The solution is stable against the inverse cube law for the resistivity. We consider two different parameter regimes: (1) small dynamic pressure and large magnetic field and (2) large dynamic pressure and small magnetic field. We solve the equations in a resistive MHD approximation. The obtained solutions are in good agreement with observations. We find that in both regimes the dominant energy release process is the MHD catastrophe. We also found the energy released in the form of particle kinetic energy is significant only in the regime (1). We discuss the implications of our results for the energy budget of CMEs. We also discuss the problem of the low-frequency (LCF) generation in the context of our model."}
{"text":"\n\nWe study the production of Higgs bosons at the LHC, focusing on the transverse-momentum (TM) distribution of the Higgs bosons and the resummation of their mean-square transverse momentum. We find that the latter effect can significantly boost the cross section for Higgs boson production with large transverse momenta in the effective field theory framework. For a Higgs boson with a given transverse momentum, the boost can be as large as a factor of two, and the ratio of the resummated cross section to the leading one can be larger than two in the high-transverse-momentum region. In the limit of large Higgs mass, the boost from resummation can be so large that the resummated cross section can dominate the total cross section, which may have important practical consequences for the search for Higgs bosons with large transverse momenta at the LHC. We also investigate the rapidity dependence of the cross section for Higgs boson production, and show that the high-rapidity cross section can be enhanced by a factor of two through the resummation effect."}
{"text":"\nWe show that the recent observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) are consistent with the thick brane model (TBM). In the TBM, the effective energy density of the dark matter (DM) field is enhanced in comparison with the standard model (SM) and critical to the evolution of the large-scale structure (LSS). We consider the LSS formation in the TBM in the same way as in the SM and show that in both cases the LSS formation is compatible with the observations of the galaxy distribution and the CMB anisotropy. We also show that in both cases the power spectrum of the CMB temperature can be described by the Gaussian model. In the TBM, the effective DM energy density is enhanced, which leads to the faster evolution of the LSS and to the smaller power of the matter fluctuations in the CMB temperature compared to the SM. We also discuss the problem of the origin of the DM field in the TBM and show that the observations of the CMB exclude the pure scalar model, but are consistent with the TBM with a vector or a scalar field with a small bulk viscosity."}
{"text":"\n\nWe propose and investigate a general framework of quantum-like representations for macroscopic configurations. We show that such a framework can be constructed byextending the notion of spatial symmetry to the macroscopic level, and that this extension can be used to formulate a quantization procedure for such representations. Our main results are as follows. First, we show that if a macroscopic configuration possesses a certain kind of symmetry, the corresponding quantum-like representation can be obtained by means of a one-to-one mapping from the set of macroscopic degrees of freedom to the set of quantum degrees of freedom. Second, we show that if the mapping is not one-to-one, the quantum-like representation can still be obtained by means of a many-to-one mapping from the set of macroscopic degrees of freedom to the set of quantum degrees of freedom, which results in a representation with an excess number of quantum degrees of freedom. In both cases, the quantum-like representation can be obtained by a simple change of basis in the space of the macroscopic degrees of freedom. As an application, we show that the proposed framework can be used to represent the position and orientation of a macroscopic object in a gravitational field, and that the framework is consistent with the principles of general relativity."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present the first precise radial velocity measurements of over a hundred main sequence L-dwarfs in the solar neighbourhood. We aim to measure the total number of bodies in the Galactic scattering volume that can be detected at a given signal-to-noise ratio. Our sample consists of 125 L-dwarfs with a precise absolute radial velocity measurement and an optical spectral type classified by an expert. We derive the radial velocity and Galactic orbit of each star, and present a comparison of the local properties of L-dwarfs with previously known radial velocity samples of main sequence M-dwarfs, giant stars, and solar twins. We determine the detectability threshold for a given body as a function of the density distribution of the interstellar medium and the orbital distance from the Sun. We find that the current detection limit is 1.35 cm\/s for an average density of 2.5 cm^2 pc-3, and that a large fraction of the local L-dwarfs could be detected with a few years of dedicated observing time on a 3.5 m telescope. The detection limit changes dramatically if a large, distant clump of molecular clouds is encountered. We discuss the potential of this technique for estimating the local abundance of L-dwarfs and the contribution of different formation mechanisms to the observed properties of these stars."}
{"text":"\nWe propose a new derivation of Einstein gravity, which does not require the axiom of choice nor the techniques of differential geometry. Our construction is based on the bare bones of general relativity: the geodesic principle, the principle of equivalence, and the Tractatus- relativity theorem. We show that these principles and theorem, in their most general form, can be used to derive all the main ingredients of general relativity, including the topological structure of spacetime, without making any appeal to the differential geometric structure of the Riemannian manifold underlying the theory. Our analysis reveals that the axiom of choice is invoked only when a specific choice is made of a class of symmetric metric functions that are used to define the Levi-Civita connection and the Riemannian curvature scalar. We show that this choice can be avoided by using only the trace class of symmetric metric functions. We phrase our construction in the language of symmetric holomorphic functions and symmetric creamy lunches."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a simple method to measure the parallax of galaxies using the Spitzer Space Telescope and a model of the microlens parallax effect. We use the fact that the microlens effect amplifies the parallax of galaxies when the source galaxy is at or beyond the limit of parallax detection. Our method is to observe a source galaxy as it is amplified by a microlens, located between the source galaxy and the observer, in aWarm Spitzer IR image. We derive the lensing magnification from the image, and then search the source galaxy neighborhood for a second galaxy which is not lensed. We then measure the angular separation between these two galaxies. The measured angular separation is the combined parallax of the two galaxies plus the microlens parallax. We model the microlens parallax with a simple geometric model that includes the lensing magnification, the observed angular separation between the source galaxy and the lens, and the lens recession velocity. We present a case study of a source galaxy at high redshift (z \u223c 1.5), and estimate the source galaxy's parallax to be PA \u223c 1.75 \u00b1 0.1 milliarcseconds (mas), and the microlens parallax to be PA \u223c 5.0 \u00b1 1.2 mas. We find that the microlens effect can substantially increase the number of galaxies for which parallax can be measured, if the source galaxy is at or beyond the limit of detection for direct parallax measurements."}
{"text":"\nWe study the bulk viscosity of a cold CFL superfluid, with a focus on the dynamic Casimir effect. We consider the limit in which the bulk viscosity is dominated by the dynamic Casimir effect, and show that the dynamic Casimir effect has a non-monotonic dependence on the temperature. We calculate the bulk viscosity in this limit, and find that it has a minimum at a temperature that depends on the mass of the atoms in the superfluid. We show that this minimum is protected by a mechanism that is analogous to the one that protects the order parameter from becoming positive. We then consider a generalization of the model in which the kinetic energy is not a constant, but is related to the bulk viscosity by a parameter that may be positive or negative. We show that the bulk viscosity in this case has a minimum that is protected by a different mechanism. We then consider the limit in which the kinetic energy is a constant, and show that the bulk viscosity has a minimum at a temperature that depends on the value of the kinetic energy. We finally show that the bulk viscosity has a non-monotonic dependence on the temperature in this limit as well."}
{"text":"\nWe present an explanation for the puzzle of the $B\\to\\phi K^*$ polarization. We show that the puzzle can be resolved by considering the structure of the helicity amplitudes.

This 'standardised' polarimeter is then related to the standard $B\\to\\phi K^*$ polarimeter, with the 'standard' helicity amplitudes modified by a corrective function which depends on the helicity of the incident $B$ meson. We show that this corrective function can be related to the $B\\to\\pi K^*$ helicity amplitude. In this way the $B\\to\\phi K^*$ puzzle can be viewed as a special case of the general problem of measuring the helicity of a meson.

{"text":"\n\nWe present the results of a narrow band imaging survey for Ly-alpha emission-line galaxies (ELGs) in the Extended Chandra Deep Field South (ECDF-S). The survey was conducted with Subaru\/SuprimeCam at $z=3.1$, over an area of $2.37\\times 1.00$ degrees, and with $\\delta_{\\rm band}$ = $1.0$ arcmin. This is the first ELG survey conducted over an extragalactic sky field at intermediate redshift (z < 1), providing a unique view of the large-scale structure of the Universe at this epoch. We find 784 ELGs in our survey, with an estimated ELG number density of $2.5 \\times 10^{-2}$ deg$^{-1}$. The ELGs show a large degree of organisation, with a number of distinct groups and filaments, some of which extend several degrees. The properties of the ELGs (number density, sizes, and luminosities) are consistent with the large-scale distribution of galaxies in the Universe at z = 3.1, as traced by the survey galaxies in the optical and near-infrared, and by the distribution of intergalactic hydrogen at that epoch. The properties of the ELGs are inconsistent with the predictions of the currently popular theories of galaxy formation that assume a slow accretion history of galaxies in large scale structures, but are consistent with the predictions of theories that assume that galaxies in large-scale structure form through violent merging events. We show that the distribution of the ELGs is well described by a simple power law, with the probability of finding an ELG decreasing as the square of the distance from the nearest large scale structure. This provides strong evidence that large-scale structure forms through the aggregation of ELGs, rather than the accretion of galaxies in smooth accelerators. We discuss the implications of our results for theories of galaxy formation and large-scale structure formation, and for the nature of the intergalactic medium at z < 1."}

We show that the transition map can be written as a polynomial in the eigenvalues of M. We show that the matrix M can be computed from the transition map, and conversely the transition map can be computed from the matrix M. We show that the transition map can be computed from the original and final bases by solving a polynomial system.

{"text":"\n\nWe present a systematic study of the departure from chemical equilibrium in the atmospheres of substellar mass objects. The main motivation for this work is the fact that the atmospheres of these objects are known to be chemically non-equilibrium, and the large number of molecular species that have been detected in the atmosphere of the solar twin planet, HD 209458 b, implies that this chemical non-equilibrium may be significant. We focus our study on giant exoplanets and brown dwarfs with known atmospheres, and explore how the chemical composition of these atmospheres depart from chemical equilibrium. We find that the most chemically non-equilibrium atmosphere is that of the brown dwarf, Gliese 667 Cc, which contains several species in excess of what would be expected from equilibrium chemistry, including carbon monoxide and acetone. We also find that giant exoplanet atmospheres are, on average, more chemically equilibrated than brown dwarf atmospheres, and that the chemical equilibrium is strongly dependent on the metallicity of the object. Our results suggest that chemical equilibrium is not well described by the mean molecular weight approach used in this work, and that a more sophisticated approach is needed to properly describe chemical equilibrium in these atmospheres.\n\nWe thank the following people for helpful discussions: C.

{"text":"\nImproving Intrinsic Decoherence in Multi-Quantum-Dot Charge Qubits\nWe propose and analyze a scheme to enhance the coherence of a multi-quantum-dot charge qubit by adjusting the strengths of the Coulomb interactions between the dots and the gate electrodes. Our approach is based on the insight that the intrinsic decoherence of such a qubit is mainly due to the fact that the state of the qubit is not an atomic one, but rather a superposition of several atomic states that are all stable against thermal fluctuations. We show that this problem can be mitigated by using a cunning combination of three gate electrodes to locally break the symmetry of the problem, in a way that the various atomic states can be made to interfere destructively. Our scheme is particularly robust against noise in the gate electrodes and fluctuations in the temperature. Furthermore, it can be applied to various geometries of multi-quantum-dot charge qubits, and even to charge qubits that are coupled to other qubits. We analyze the scheme both analytically and numerically, and we find that it improves the coherence time of a multi-dot charge qubit by several orders of magnitude."}

We show that this problem can be solved by a simple recurrent neural network with no lateral connections, and only one layer of hidden units. This allows us to consider a more general setting, where the input words may not be derived from a context-free grammar, but still share some properties with words derived from context-free grammars. We show that this generalized CRF-structure recognition problem can be solved by a simple recurrent neural network with one layer of hidden units, and an output layer that outputs a probability distribution over CRF-structures. The performance of this recurrent neural network is essentially as good as the performance of a much more complex model with many lateral connections and multiple hidden layers. This work attempts to solve two problems: (1) what is the minimal number of parameters required to solve the generalized CRF-structure recognition problem, and (2) can this generalized CRF-structure recognition problem be solved by a simple recurrent neural network? The answer to the first question is a simple recurrent neural network with only one layer of hidden units. The answer to the second question is yes."}
{"text":"\nWe consider the Standard Model (SM) in the presence of an abelian group symmetry $Q$ which includes the quark and the lepton as well as the gauge symmetries. The SM Lagrangian is invariant under the simultaneous reflection of all the $Q$-symmetry generators, that is, under the so-called Quark Loop (QL) transformation. By using the conventional $Q$-invariant SM lagrangian, we show that the QL transformation gives rise to three new electrically neutral scalar particles with masses proportional to the square of the QL mass parameter $m_{QL}$, to the square of the lepton mass $m_{l}$, and to the inverse of the QL mass respectively. We show that these new particles can explain the long puzzling neutrino masses and the EDMs of the neutron and the deuteron without any additional symmetries such as R-parity. We also show that the QL masses can be as small as the lepton mass $m_{l}$ and that the neutron and the deuteron EDMs can be as large as the EDMs of the proton and the electron respectively. This makes the small QL masses and the large neutron and deuteron EDMs natural and non-contradictory. We also consider the QL mass generation in the context of the supersymmetric Standard Model (SSM) without R-parity. We show that the QL masses in the SSM can be as small as the lepton mass $m_{l}$ and that the neutron and the deuteron EDMs can be as large as the EDMs of the proton and the electron respectively.

{"text":"\n\nWe present the first search for heavy chiral bosons in hadron collisions, using a sample of jet+ETmiss events in p-pbar collisions at \\sqrt{s}=1.96 TeV collected with the CMS detector at the LHC. We use a boosted decision tree to distinguish between QCD and heavy chiral bosons in the world-largest-ever search for heavy chiral bosons in hadron collisions, and find no evidence for heavy chiral bosons above the Standard Model (SM) scale. We set cross section limits in a model-independent manner, and translate these limits into world-best lower limits on the heavy chiral boson mass in a number of benchmark models. We find that the lower limit on the heavy chiral boson mass in the simplest benchmark model (in which the heavy chiral bosons are assumed to be uncharged and couple only to SM particles) is $m_{hcb} \\ge 1.9 TeV\/c^2$. We also show that this limit is largely independent of the precise details of the benchmark model. In other words, a heavy chiral boson with a mass of $m_{hcb} \\ge 1.9 TeV\/c^2$ would couple so strongly to SM particles that it would be produced in hadron collisions at a rate that is small compared to the expected production rate of SM particles, regardless of the details of the heavy chiral boson model.

We find a large number of galaxies with peculiar motions, and the peculiar motion distribution is found to be correlated with the large-scale structure in the region, in agreement with our expectations. We also find that the peculiar motion distribution is significantly different from the distribution expected assuming that peculiar motions are randomly assigned to galaxies in the region, in accordance with our hypothesis that large-scale flows are present in the region. We discuss these results in the framework of a simple model of the evolution of the local supercluster, in which a galaxy group infall velocity field is coupled to the large-scale structure, in order to explain the origin of the peculiar motions and the correlation with the large-scale structure."}
{"text":"\nWe propose and experimentally realize a novel passive polymer optical fiber demultiplexer, which is based on a locally selective filtering technique and can be fabricated in a cost-effective manner. The demultiplexer is able to separate optical signals with different wavelengths in the wavelength range of the optical communication C band into their respective channels. The proposed filter design is based on a combination of a graded-index polymer optical fiber and a uniformly-indexed fiber. By appropriately selecting the refractive index profile of the graded-index fiber, the desired filter function can be obtained. The proposed demultiplexer can be realized using a simple and cost-effective fabrication method. It does not require any polishing or bonding processes, and can be simply implemented by fusing two polymer optical fibers together. The proposed design and the fabrication method are validated by experimentally realizing a four-channel demultiplexer. The realized demultiplexer is characterized in terms of its transmission spectrum and the channel isolation."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a far-infrared (IR) background spectrum of the cosmic background radiation (CBR) determined from the COBE\/DIRBE data, and a corresponding set of far-IR spectral models. The data set used for the spectrum compilation consists of the latest COBE\/DIRBE data, with a total integration time of 564.4 ks, and the WHAM data with an integration time of 105.4 ks. The high sensitivity of the COBE\/DIRBE instrument allows us to measure the background in the far-IR region below 8 \u03bcm with a sensitivity of ~5 mK. The spectrum is featureless with a high level of homogeneity, and is in agreement with a blackbody spectrum with a temperature of 37 K. The fitting procedure used to derive the blackbody temperature from the spectrum is described. The main spectral model parameters are the dust temperature, the total optical depth, and the local excess optical depth. The best-fit model to the data has a dust temperature of 36.5 K, a total optical depth of 1.00, and a local excess optical depth of 0.09.

{"text":"\n\nWe report on a new flaring event of the ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX) in the elliptical galaxy NGC 1365. The event was observed on January 14, 2012, with a peak luminosity of  \u223c 5 kL\u22c5s\u22121 and a duration of \u223c 5 ks. The observed peak luminosity is  \u223c 1.5 kL\u22c5s\u22121 brighter than the outburst reported in 2005. The outburst is spatially coincident with the previous event. We find that the accretion rate is  \u223c 1.4 kgs\u22121, which is  \u223c 1.6 kgs\u22121 lower than the accretion rate derived from the 2005 event. The 2005 event was associated with a supermassive black hole (SMBH) of  \u223c 6 \u00d7 107 M\u22c5kg\u22121, which is  \u223c 2.3 kgs\u22121 more massive than the SMBH derived from the present event. The low accretion rate and the high mass of the SMBH suggest that the present event is a transitory phenomenon, probably caused by a slingshot from a minor companion. Our estimates of the accretion rate and the SMBH mass are consistent with the simplest version of the slingshot model, in which the companion has a mass of  \u223c 1 % of the SMBH mass and it moves on a coplanar orbit with a radius of  \u223c 3 rSMBH, where rSMBH is the SMBH radius. We discuss the timing of the present event in the context of the possible evolutionary scenarios of the SMBH-binaries."}
{"text":"\nWe investigated the influence of horizontal gene transfer on the mean fitness of unicellular populations in static environments. We used a simple epidemiological model in which the fitness of an individual depends on the presence or absence of a particular gene. In our model, horizontal gene transfer events are rare but can have a large effect on the mean fitness of the population. We found that the fitness of an individual is not a good measure of its evolutionary success. Populations with high mean fitness can be the result of a few individuals with very high fitness or a large number of individuals with relatively low fitness. We also found that the evolutionary success of a population is not always proportional to its mean fitness. Populations with high mean fitness can go extinct, while populations with low mean fitness can survive and evolve. Our results suggest that the evolutionary success of a population depends on the distribution of fitness among individuals, not just the mean fitness."}
{"text":"\nWe present a comparison of large-scale star formation in three nearby star-forming regions: Serpens, Perseus, and Ophiuchus. We use high-resolution Bolocam 1.1 mm dust continuum images to trace the distribution of dust, the precursor to stars, on scales of ~5-10 arcseconds over the three regions. We find that the observed distributions of dust, as traced by the dust continuum, are consistent with a simple model in which the dust is concentrated in a few massive clouds, with the clouds lying along the same line in each region. We compare the dust continuum images to submillimeter continuum images from the SCUBA camera on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope, and find that the dust continuum peaks align well with the submillimeter continuum peaks, providing support for the simple model. We present a comparison of the star formation rates in each region, derived from counts of young stars in the same regions, and find that the simple model provides a good fit to the observed star formation rates. We discuss possible mechanisms for the formation of massive star forming clouds on large scales, and find that the observed distribution of massive star forming regions is consistent with a model in which clouds are formed by the gravitational collapse of large-scale density enhancements, perhaps associated with superclusters of molecular clouds."}

The new algorithm is tested on a number of synthetic examples and the results are compared to those obtained by the original Lagrangian method as well as to those obtained by the widely used Partial Least Squares (PLS) method. We also apply the new algorithm to the analysis of real microarray data sets, obtained from a publicly available resource. In all cases, the proposed method gives comparable or better results than the original Lagrangian method and the PLS method, in terms of both the quality of the reconstructed system and the statistical significance of the parameters."}
{"text":"\n\nLet linear channels of vector inputs be represented by a Toeplitz-like matrix, in which the elements of any row are inner products between vectors in the input alphabet and a vector in the output alphabet. Let the channel be subject to a constraint, which we express as an inner product between a vector in the input alphabet and a vector in a specified subset of the output alphabet. We show that any such channel can be exactly decomposed into an interior point model, with a tractable objective function. The channel thus can be decoded by finding the input sequence that minimizes the objective function. The resulting algorithm is guaranteed to converge provided the input and output vectors are drawn from suitable alphabets. We show how to derive the input and output alphabets, and thus the input and output masks, so as to guarantee convergence. We analyze the performance of the algorithm in terms of the properties of the channel, and show how to derive a relaxed optimization problem that is tractable in the same way as the original problem."}
{"text":"\n\nWe have recently proposed a model of Borromean Halo Nuclei (BHN) based on the violation of conservation of quantum numbers. This model can be used to explain the structure and properties of many nuclei which are challenging to describe within the framework of the standard Nuclear theory. In this work we will study the geometry of the BHN model in greater detail. We will show that the violation of conservation of quantum numbers naturally leads to a structure in which the nucleons are arranged in a manner similar to the one observed in many complex nuclei. In particular we will show that the geometry of the BHN model can be described by a distance dependent potential which has a very similar shape as the one used to describe the Interactions between the nucleons in the standard Nuclear theory. We will also show that the structure of the BHN model can be further simplified by using the concept of the 'hole' and the 'line'. Finally we will show that the BHN model can be used to explain the structure and properties of some nuclei which are not well described by the standard Nuclear theory."}

{"text":"\n\nWe present a spectral study of the dips in the light curve of the low-mass X-ray binary Cir X-1. We find that the rise times of the dips are well described by a power law with a photon index of 1.3 \u00b1 0.1. This is consistent with a single temperature structure in the accretion disc, with a temperature gradient of 3 K cm-1. We show that this result can be obtained by balancing the energy budget of the system, provided that the accretion disc is geometrically thick and that the temperature is uniform on scales larger than the size of the accretion disc. We discuss this result in the framework of the double-disc model, and we show that a simple prescription that the inner disc is colder than the outer disc is sufficient to reproduce our observations. We show that the excess scatter in the power law is consistent with a simple model in which the accretion disc is surrounded by a cavity, with a few non-thermal ionisation contributions along the lines of sight. We discuss this in the framework of the model proposed by 2018A&AS...637..116L, according to which the excess scatter is caused by temperature inhomogeneities on the surface of the disc. We show that a model in which the disc is surrounded by a cavity gives a slightly better fit to the data, but that the physical interpretation is very similar. We conclude that the spectral shape of the dips in the light curve of Cir X-1 is consistent with a double-disc structure, with the inner disc being cooler than the outer disc, and that there are few contributions along the lines of sight that are not consistent with a single temperature structure."}

We show that these three classes are statistically distinct from each other with high confidence (99% for the first and second class and 95% for the third class). Our results are consistent with the view that the different burst classes correspond to different physical mechanisms of energy release. We show that the three-class model can reproduce the main features of the burst population observed in our data set and provides a good description of the observed distribution of burst durations and peak counts. We find that the most powerful bursts, in terms of peak count, are distributed approximately equally among the three classes, whereas the least powerful bursts are mostly distributed in the first two classes. This suggests that the most powerful bursts are likely to be formed through a different physical mechanism than the least powerful bursts."}

The main theoretical tool we use is the method of Direct423. We determine the partial branching ratio $B_{J^{PC}1}$ and the direct CP asymmetry $A$ of these two decays, for a range of $p_T$ values. We find that the partial branching ratio increases with $p_T$ in a way that is consistent with the theoretical prediction of Direct423, but that the direct CP asymmetry is not in agreement with the prediction of Direct423. The disagreement is in a way such that the relative difference between the theoretical prediction and the measurement decreases with $p_T$. We show this by comparing our measurements to the prediction of Direct423, and we find that the disagreement is too large to be explained by a statistical model in which the theory and the measurement are both correct, unless the statistical model includes an extra parameter which allows the prediction of Direct423 to be improved. We therefore conclude that either the theory of Direct423 is incorrect, or our measurement is incorrect.

{"text":"\nWe present a detailed study of the inner region of the barred spiral galaxy NGC 4258, which contains a pronounced warp and several warped spiral arms. We show that the distribution of young stars in the disk is very well described by a Bardeen-Petterson effect arising from an asymmetric density distribution in the bar. We model the bar as a simple prolate spheroidal with a radial mass distribution that is parameterized by a power law. The power law index is further correlated with the opening angle of the bar. We show that the warped disk can be produced by a combination of the Bardeen-Petterson effect and an upward\/downward Infalling Motion effect, provided that the stellar population in the disk is infalling from the outer boundary. The Infalling Motion effect is shown to be necessary to produce the observed correlation between the stellar velocity dispersion and the local surface density.

{"text":"\nWe study a three-dimensional, controllable Brownian motor attached to a lattice with a high-index topographical defect. We show analytically and numerically that the Brownian motor's dynamic responds to the underlying lattice defect in a strong and nonlinear manner. In particular, the statistical displacement of the motor increases in the presence of the defect, and it exhibits directed transport along the defect's longitudinal direction. We explain these phenomena by a detailed analysis of the spatial and temporal correlations of the motor's dynamic, which reveals the existence of an effective random walk dynamics in the presence of the defect. We also analyze the dependence of the transport efficiency on the system parameters, such as the strength of the anchoring interaction and the size of the motor particles. Our results suggest that high-index topographical defects can have a significant influence on the dynamic of Brownian motors, and they may be used to control the transport efficiency and direction in Brownian transport systems."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider a modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND-like) based on the following two simple principles: (i) the gravitational field is given by a potential field (a self-accelerating field-theory), and (ii) the motion of bodies is arrested at a finite distance from massive bodies (such a cosmological constant). We show that such a theory can be made consistent with both the principles of general relativity and the motions of galaxies in the Local Group. We evaluate the Newtonian limit of the theory and show that it displays a suitable relation to the MOND acceleration scale. We analyze a model in which the potential is a function only of the distance between objects, and show that it is capable of describing the dynamics of galaxies in the Local Group, as well as the large-scale structure of the Universe. The parameters of the model are consistent with the idea that the dark matter component has a specific heat of $\\sim 1\/2$. We also analyze a model in which the potential is a function of the distance and an extra dimension, and show that it is capable of describing the dynamics of galaxies in the Local Group as well as the large-scale structure of the Universe, provided that the extra dimension is very small.

{"text":"\nWe present an analytical model that reveals the nature of phase transition in magnetic thin films, especially in those with a perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. Our approach is based on a systematic variation of the ratio of the in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic permeabilities in the thermodynamic equilibrium state of the nanoscale magnetic films. We show that the resulting phase diagram has a unique meta-stable phase, in which the magnetization is entirely oriented out of the film plane, and a stable phase, in which the magnetization is either entirely in-plane or has a component in-plane. Our model makes quantitative predictions for the magnetic properties of the nanoscale films in the meta-stable phase, which can be tested with existing experimental data. In particular, our model predicts a non-monotonic behavior of the in-plane magnetization as a function of the thickness of the magnetic thin film, in contrast to the monotonically increasing in-plane magnetization as a function of the film thickness predicted by the standard theory. Our model also predicts the existence of a critical thickness of the magnetic film, below which the out-of-plane magnetization becomes completely impossible."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present an analysis of the optical and X-ray properties of the cooling flow cluster Z3146.

We estimate the temperatures of the intracluster gas and the detached clumps, and find that they differ by about 2.5 kK. We argue that the cool detached clumps have been formed through the collapse of large voids, and that the intracluster gas has been compressed by the infall of these clumps. We find that the surface brightness of the cluster is not uniform, but has a correlation with the local X-ray temperature. We interpret this correlation in terms of the contribution of the detached clumps to the total surface brightness. We find that the cool detached clumps have a mean mass of 4.3 kM\u22c5 pc\u22122, and that they are responsible for 17% of the total surface brightness. The highest surface brightness is found in the regions with the highest X-ray temperature, where the contribution from detached clumps is small.

{"text":"\nWe present a new method to study the afterglows and flares of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) based on the Inverse Compton scattering of the burst's gamma-rays off the ambient medium. We derive a simple analytical expression for the time evolution of the burst's afterglow brightness in terms of the parameters of the burst and the ambient medium. We use this expression to investigate the evolution of the afterglow brightness of the Bursts of the current GRB catalogue. We find that a significant number of bursts exhibit a clear power law decay of the afterglow brightness, with a decay index that is proportional to the burst's fluence. This is consistent with a predominantly inverse Compton emission process. We show that the afterglow brightness can be used to infer the energy distribution of the ambient medium, thus providing a direct probe of the burst's environment. We also find that the afterglow brightness is well described by a sum of exponential functions, each corresponding to the burst's light curve, delayed by a characteristic time. We show that these characteristic times are related to the microphysical properties of the ambient medium, and thus provide information about the medium's composition. We discuss the limitations of the method and future work that would improve the reliability of the inferred properties."}
{"text":"\n\nThe Hypercube of Life: How Protein Stability Imposes Limits on Organism Complexity and Speed of Molecular Evolution\n\nWe present a mathematical framework for studying the evolution of organism complexity, based on the idea that the fundamental constraint on biological systems is the stability of proteins. We show that living systems can be understood as solutions to the protein stability problem, and that this problem has a characteristic complexity scaling that imposes limits on the complexity and speed of molecular evolution. We term this scaling the \"hypercube of life.\" We find that the complexity and speed of molecular evolution are limited by the number of stable protein structures, and that this number is relatively small for single-domain proteins. We show that these limits can be overcome by forming multi-domain proteins, which can evolve to have multiple stable folds. We demonstrate that such proteins can evolve to have arbitrarily complex folds, and that the speed of their evolution is essentially unlimited. We propose that the limited protein stability problem can be seen as a trade-off between the number of stable structures and the speed of evolution, and that this trade-off explains why single-domain proteins are limited in their complexity and speed of evolution, while multi-domain proteins are not."}
{"text":"\nWe study the possibility of sending a charged dust ball through the Reissner--Nordstr\\\"{o}m wormhole. Our main result is that, in contrast to the situation for a point-like charged particle, a charged dust ball can in general not be sent through the wormhole. The main reasons for this are the following: (1) If the electric field in the wormhole is not zero, the dust ball will be attracted to one of the sides of the wormhole and can in general not be sent through the wormhole. (2) If the electric field in the wormhole is zero, we must have that the electric field in the external space is also zero. Therefore, it is in general not possible to send a positively charged dust ball through the wormhole, as the positive charge will attract the dust ball to the wormhole. (3) In the special case where the dust ball is made up of only two point-like charges, the dust ball can in general not be sent through the wormhole, as the two charges will be attracted to each other and will in general not be able to pass each other in the wormhole."}

We relate this to a generalization of a result due to cushioniatry, that the distance to the boundary of a convex set is controlled by the extreme points and the nearest vertex to the boundary. The convex sets we consider are the special linear classes of matrices, the so-called convex bodies, which are the generalizations to n- dimensions of the n-th power of a matrix and the sum of a convex combination of matrices. We show that any convex body can be represented as the convex hull of a certain number of so-called Guests, which are certain special types of matrices. We also show how the semidefinite representation of convex sets can be used to obtain new results in the theory of similarity measures."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present predictions, derived from standard solar models, for the properties of the solar neutrino flux expected from the SNO+ experiment. We consider the full range of physical possibilities for the solar model, including those which are not compatible with a standard atmospheric model. We show that the standard solar model predicts a neutrino flux that is consistent with the current SNO result, but is inconsistent with the SNO+ result in a pure geo-charAtron source. We then consider a non-standard solar model in which the partisan flux from geo-charAtron and from a stellar companion are comparable. We show that such a model can produce a neutrino flux that is consistent with both the SNO and SNO+ results, if the spin-flavor precession of the neutrinos is small compared to the Earth's orbital precession. We estimate the necessary precession to be $\\sim 10^{-25}$, which is small compared to the $\\sim 10^{8}$ precession that the Earth's orbit undergoes in one year, but is not strictly forbidden by the standard solar model. We show that this non-standard model can also explain the \"OVERFLOW\" and \"UNDiagnostics\" signals in the SNO data, which remain unexplained in the standard model. We also consider a model in which the solar mass is reduced, while keeping the baryonic mass fixed, and show that such a model can produce a neutrino flux consistent with the SNO+ result, if the flavor-spin precession is large enough. We discuss the implications of our results for future solar neutrino experiments, for the solar model, and for the origin of the solar neutrino flux."}
{"text":"\n\nWe study the problem of determining a sufficient condition for the departure from Gaussianity in the ensemble average of the signals in a turbulent flow. Our motivation is the fact that the ensemble average of the instantaneous velocity measurements in a turbulent flow usually shows a clear departure from Gaussianity. We focus on a simple model of turbulence, where the velocity fluctuations are driven by a Gaussian white noise source and the resulting velocity distribution is contaminated by an additive Gaussian noise. We find that the departure from Gaussianity can be characterized by a simple index, which has a clear physical meaning and has a very good agreement with the results of the statistical hypothesis testing procedure. We show that this index has a simple and universal expression, which does not depend on the details of the velocity measurement process. The only input parameters are the standard deviation of the Gaussian white noise source, which characterizes the strength of the turbulence and the standard deviation of the additive Gaussian noise, which characterizes the quality of the measurement process. This finding has important practical implications, as we show by an example application to the problem of characterizing the velocity distribution in an actual turbulent flow."}
{"text":"\n\nWe study a model of a quantum system living on a line, which is described by a semi-classically consistent formalism that extends the notion of a wave function to one-dimensional spaces. Our primary motivation is to understand the conceptual and operational aspects of the definition and usage of the concepts of superposition and entanglement in such settings, in the presence of a finite number of qubits. We show that in spite of the finiteness of the system, many of the properties of infinite-qubit systems carry over, in a consistent fashion, to the finite setting. We focus on the characterization of the system's symmetry group, the requirements for a local operation to be invertible, and the basic measurements that can be performed on the system. We also analyze the effect of a qubit loss on the properties of the system, and show that a particular class of measurements is resilient to qubit loss. Our results shed light on the rich structure of quantum systems on a line, and have implications for both theoretical and experimental research."}
{"text":"\n\nThe Distance Geometry of Music\nWe present a method for the analysis of musical structures that is based on the idea of measuring the Euclidean distance between the pitches of a pair of notes. We show that this simple idea can be used to define a large class of distance measures that are well-defined for any piece of music and that are related to the well-known notions of music cognition, such as the Western twelve-tone equal-tempered scale, the piano keyboard layout, and the cell- and matrix-based representations of music. In addition, we show that the set of distance measures is not only uncountably infinite, but that it also contains a well-defined distance function that corresponds to the psychophysical dimensions of pitch. Furthermore, we show that the set of all possible distance functions is isometric to the set of all possible Hankel matrices. We discuss a number of practical applications of this approach, and we show that it can be used to extract meaningful information from a wide range of musical styles and to obtain new insights into the structure-function relationships in music."}
{"text":"\nWe present a detailed spectral analysis of the type Ib supernova 1999dn. We find that the supernova (SN) is well described by a spectroscopic model with two parameters: the relative abundance of Fe and the effective temperature. A comparison of the observed and theoretical spectral shapes shows that the early-time behavior of the radiative shock wave is well described by a parametrized law. We show that the observed fit to this law implies that the supernova was an ultra-low-mass object (M \u2248 1.2 M \u2299) before the explosion. We then derive a new formalism for describing the radiative shock-wave phase in SNe of this type. The derived theory correctly predicts the observed correlation between the relative abundance of Fe and the strength of the spectral continuum. This is demonstrated by performing a least-squares fit to the observed data. The fit gives a best value of the ratio Fe\/Ni of 1.6 \u00b1 0.3, which is close to the solar ratio. We also derive a formula for the effective temperature, which is found to be T \u2248 8500 K. We show that this value is consistent with the observed behavior of the shock wave. We briefly discuss the implications of these results for theories of type Ib SNe."}
{"text":"\nWe present a microscopic theory of the dynamics of spins localized at the amorphous-semiconductor\/oxide interface. We consider the case of a spin- valve device, where the spins are anchored by dangling bonds. We evaluate the relaxation time and the magnetic 1\/f noise for an arbitrary spin-valve configuration, for a range of temperatures, and for different spin-orbital interactions. We find that the spin relaxation time is always very short, of the order of a few picoseconds, and that it does not depend on the details of the spin-orbital interaction, but only on the strength of the interaction and on the temperature. In contrast, the 1\/f noise depends on the details of the spin-orbital interaction, in particular on the relative strengths of the two orbital moments. We evaluate the 1\/f noise level for a range of temperatures and find that it is small in the temperature interval of interest for spintronic devices, but that it could be large if the temperature is reduced far below the glass transition temperature of the amorphous semiconductor."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider the problem of distilling a weak solution of a pure solvent into a solvent of higher purity. We suppose that the initial solution is distilled in a single vessel, and that the distillate is collected in a reservoir. The reservoir is connected to a secondary condenser that receives the vapor of the pure solvent from the reservoir. We assume that the amount of vapor is finite and that the solution and the reservoir are well mixed. We show that this distillation process can be described by a simple model. The model consists of a system of ordinary differential equations, where the solution is the composition of the solution and the vapor in the reservoir. The initial conditions of the system are related to the initial solution, and the final condition is that the solution in the reservoir reaches the desired purity level. We show that this model has a unique solution, and we study the parameter regions in which the solution exists and is stable. In particular, we find that the distillate purity level is lower if the vapor in the reservoir is not controlled. We also analyze the model from the perspective of communication theory. We show that the distillation process can be described by a simple symbolic model using bounded classical communication."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a global magnetohydrodynamical model of turbulence in protoplanetary disks. Our model is based on the turbulence kinetic energy budget and includes a complete set of turbulent transport equations for solids, ions, and the magnetic field. We solve the set of transport equations on a Cartesian grid, in a cylindrical potential, with the help of a turbulence model based on the dynamic transport of turbulent fluctuations. We find that the inclusion of a dynamic transport model for turbulence leads to a fast and efficient numerical simulation tool for studying the evolution of turbulence in protoplanetary disks. With our model, we are able to simulate the evolution of turbulence in disks with stationary as well as rotating accretion sources. We study the influence of the disk's geometry, boundary conditions, and initial conditions on the evolution of turbulence. We find that the standard Kolmogorov theory of isotropic turbulence is not applicable to protoplanetary disks. Instead, our results show that turbulence in disks is anisotropic and non-Kolmogorovian, with a different energy spectrum than Kolmogorov turbulence. We also study the transport of solids by turbulence and find that the turbulent transport of solids is strongly influenced by the magnetic field. We discuss our results in the context of recent observations of protoplanetary disks."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present photometric and spectroscopic observations of a large sample of galaxies in theGOODS\/CDF-S field, selected to be in the range of 10-40 million years old. We use the observed galaxy colors and their derived stellar mass functions to investigate the evolution of the stellar mass and the formation history of these galaxies. We find that the stellar mass of galaxies increases with age in a power-law manner, with the power of the mass function increasing with the age of the galaxy. We also find that the stellar mass function of the galaxies is well described by a broken power law, with a transition between the star-forming and quiescent phases around an age of 20-30 million years. We determine the ages of the galaxies in our sample by fitting the observed color-magnitude diagrams with the Schechter function, and we find that the ages are in good agreement with the galaxy formation history derived from the stellar mass function. We discuss our results in the framework of recent galaxy formation models, and we show that our results can be explained by a model in which galaxies are formed by the accretion of clumps of gas and dust, and in which the accretion process is stochastic and the accretion times are drawn from an exponential distribution. We show that such a model can naturally produce the power-law increase in the stellar mass function with age, as well as the break in the power law at an age of 20-30 million years. We discuss the implications of our results for the problem of the missing baryons, and we show that our results are consistent with the hypothesis that baryons are accreted in discrete events, with the accretion time being drawn from an exponential distribution."}
{"text":"\nWe present here results of a statistical study of the radio-to-X-ray spectral variability of the magnetar XTE J1810-197. We find that the radio brightness is correlated with the X-ray brightness in the 0.3-10 keV energy range, but not in the 2-4 keV range. We find that the correlation function has a steep slope and a long tail, which is consistent with the idea that the X-ray emission is due to the accretion disk around the magnetar. Our results also show that the accretion process is very inefficient, with a precipitation rate of  \u223c 1031 kg s\u22121, corresponding to a few times the mass of the Moon. We discuss the results in the framework of two different accretion models, the ball model and the disk model. We find that both models are consistent with our data, although the disk model is slightly preferred, due to the large magnetic moment of the magnetar, M(B \u223c 5 kG) and a spin-down power law (PL) with a high index (n \u223c 6), which would be needed to fit the observed radio-to-X-ray correlation. We discuss the possibilities of a spherically symmetric solution with a two-zone structure, with a PL inner zone and a constant-power-law (CPL) outer zone. We also discuss a disk model with a PL inner region, and a CPL region at large radii."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present observations of the inner jet in the nearby radio galaxy NGC 315 made with the VLA at three radio frequencies (1.4, 2.2, and 4.5 GHz) and with Chandra in hard X-rays. These observations are combined to study the distribution of the radio source in the jet on scales of tens of kpc. We find that the radio source in the jet is not homogeneously distributed but is instead composed of a large number of smaller knots, with a correlation between the X-ray and radio intensity. The simplest interpretation of this correlation is that the radio source is located in the same regions as the X-ray emission. The fact that the radio and X-ray emission is brightest at the outer edges of the jet suggests that the accretion region may be very elongated. The total mass accreted by the black hole in the central AGN is at least 5% of the total galaxy mass, including the accretion disk, which is comparable to the mass accreted by the black hole in M 87. We discuss this result in the context of the simple model of a point-sourceAccretion-disk jet. In this model the mass accretion rate is proportional to the black hole spin, and the length of the jet is proportional to the square of the spin. We show that in this model the mass accretion rate and jet length can vary by several orders of magnitude for black holes with the same spin, depending on the distribution of mass in the accretion disk. This model provides a possible physical explanation for the large variation in the mass accretion rate and jet length observed in nearby galaxies."}
{"text":"\nWe present a formal analysis of selection effects in observations of the large-scale structure of the Universe, motivated by the issue of non-linear evolution of power-law relationships. We consider the connection between the bias induced by the selection of galaxies as probes of the large-scale structure and the possibility of a non-linear evolution of the correlation functions. We show that a simple correction to the standard method of calculating the bias removes its bias, but that a non-linear evolution of the correlation functions is still possible. We analyse the case of two key relationships in large-scale structure studies: the Mbh-sigma and Mbh-L relationships. We find that the evolution of the Mbh-sigma relationship is consistent with a purely linear evolution, but that a selection bias could produce a similar evolution. We find that the Mbh-L relationship displays a clear non-linearity in its evolution, but that a selection bias can produce a similarly non-linear evolution. We quantify the selection bias in both relationships and show that the correction is minor for the Mbh-sigma relationship, but significant for the Mbh-L relationship. We discuss the implications of these results for the interpretation of large-scale structure surveys."}
{"text":"\nWe consider the question of the possibility of extracting from a rotating (asymptotically flat) brane-world a dynamical system which would describe, in the limit of large radius, the behavior of a particle subjected to an inverse square law (ISL) force. Our main result is that this is possible only if the rotation frequency is an odd multiple of the inverse of the ISL coupling. This is consistent with the fact that for even multiples of this frequency the dynamics is governed by a generalized ISL law with a non-zero fourth power of the distance. In the case of a large radius this would correspond to an inverse law with a non-zero fourth power of the radius. In this case the effective Newton's law is not Newton's law anymore, but a generalization which may be non-conservative. In the case of an odd multiple of the inverse of the ISL coupling the dynamics is described by a generalized ISL law with a vanishing fourth power of the distance. This case is physically meaningful only if the inverse square law is a special case of a more general law with a non-zero fourth power of the distance (i.e. the potential has a non-zero fourth power at large distances). We discuss possible physical meanings of this case. In both cases the main condition for the dynamics to be well-defined is that the ratio of the rotation frequency to the inverse of the ISL coupling is an integer."}
{"text":"\nWe develop a class of statistical dynamical models with a general anisotropy profile. Our approach is based on the idea of replacing the Gaussian diffusion kernel, which is the basis of the celebrated Model-Free Method, by a nonlinear diffusion kernel that depends on the involved degrees of freedom. We show that this general framework is able to accommodate a large class of dynamical models with anisotropic diffusion and that the model-free formulation has several advantages over the more traditional approach based on the analysis of the dynamical equation. In particular, we show that the model-free formulation is capable of relaxing some of the assumptions that are usually made in the analysis of the dynamical equation, such as the assumption of a Gaussian diffusion kernel or the assumption that the diffusion is isotropic. We analyze the properties of the model-free approach and we illustrate its potential by studying some simple examples of statistical dynamical models with anisotropic diffusion."}
{"text":"\nWe present a framework for optimizing scrip systems, which are common in online games. A scrip system is a mechanism where players can spend in-game resources to acquire items. These items may be persistent, such as an equipment slot or a pets, or may be single-use, such as a consumable item. We consider a setting where players may crash the system by repeatedly acquiring items in a short period of time. We also consider a setting where players may hoard the system by acquiring items and never consuming them. We use a model where players have a selfish utility that they attempt to maximize by acquiring and consuming items, and where players are also embedded in a social network. We find that scrip systems are most efficient when the social network is utilized to police the system, as opposed to imposing top-down rules. We also find that a system is more stable when players can acquire items that are only useful to them, as opposed to items that are useful to many players. Finally, we find that a small number of players cangame the system by repeatedly acquiring and consuming items. We discuss how our results impact the design of scrip systems, and how our results are important for any game system where a small number of players cangame the system."}
{"text":"\n\nWe show that the origin of the non-Gaussian distributions of financial returns is microscopic, namely, the distribution of the shocks affecting the assets' prices. To this end, we consider a general model of asset prices where the returns are driven by a large number of independent and identically distributed random variables with a general distribution, and we derive a microscopic analog of the asset price dynamics. We find that the distribution of the returns converges to a heavy-tailed distribution as the number of assets and the time horizon increases, regardless of the underlying distribution of the random variables. We provide an intuitive explanation for this result based on the fat-tailed distribution of the shocks and the convexity of the pricing function. In particular, our model implies that the most important factors for the statistical properties of the returns are the tail index and the correlation of the shocks. We show that the empirical distributions of financial returns are consistent with the assumption of independent and identically distributed shocks with a heavy tail. We also discuss the practical implications of our findings."}
{"text":"\n\nWe propose and analyze a system design for a long-line quantum repeater, which is a device that can effectively transfer quantum states between two points that are spatially separated. We consider a scenario in which the repeater is connected to a fiber network and the goal is to achieve a high-fidelity exchange of quantum states between two users who are connected to each other via a long fiber. We show that in this scenario the quantum repeater needs to be designed to have a high intrinsic fidelities of quantum state transmission, while at the same time be robust against thermal and other types of noise. To achieve this goal, we propose a system design that is based on the idea of using a semiconductor quantum dot as the intermediate quantum state, which can be efficiently initializes using a laser pulse. We then analyze the performance of this system design in terms of the achievable fidelity of quantum state transmission and the maximum length of the fiber that can be used. We show that for a given level of noise our proposed system design can achieve a higher fidelity of quantum state transmission than a system design that is based on the use of a microwave photon as the intermediate quantum state. We also show that our proposed system design can achieve a fiber length that is longer than the one that can be achieved by a system design that is based on the use of a microwave photon as the intermediate quantum state."}

{"text":"\n\nInitial Conditions for Bubble Universes\n\nWe propose a model of a universe, which is initially a bubble-like structure, containing a finite volume of homogenous and isotropic space-time. The initial conditions for this universe are derived from the requirements that the universe is to be either empty or contain only one particle. The study of the evolution of such a universe is of interest, in particular to investigate whether it will continue to be a bubble-like structure or whether it will collapse to a singularity. The model is equivalent to a soap bubble, which has initial conditions given by the minimal surface, and which also has an evolutionary history, in which it either collapses to a singularity or blows itself up to a finite volume. The main tool in the study of the evolution of this universe is the Legendre transform of the three-dimensional volume element. The Legendre transform of the three-dimensional volume element is related to the four-dimensional volume element, and in particular to the four-dimensional mass. This is used to show that the evolution of the bubble universe is given by an equation which is a combination of the Euler- Lagrange equation and the wave equation. It is shown that the bubble universe will undergo a sudden collapse to a singularity, which is in agreement with the behavior of a soap bubble."}
{"text":"\n\nThe Infrared Camera (IRC) for AKARI - Design and Imaging Performance\n\nWe present the design and performance of the IRC, the infrared camera onboard the AKARI spacecraft. The motivation for the IRC is to observe the solar corona in the 1 - 4 keV wavelength range, which is difficult to access from the Earth's surface due to the absorbing atmosphere. Our key idea is to utilize a thin filter in front of the detector to achieve the required energy rejection while keeping the optical throughput high. The IRC is a photon-counting instrument with a staring focal plane array (FPA) of 12 pixels by 12 pixels, each consisting of a micro-channel plate (MCP) and a position-sensitive detector (PSD). We conducted a comprehensive performance evaluation of the IRC, which includes a study of the imaging performance and a detailed analysis of the stray-light and the background contribution. We show that the IRC is capable of achieving the required spatial and temporal resolution for studying the solar corona in the 1 - 4 keV wavelength range, while keeping the noise level low. We also find that the stray-light level is below the detection limit, meaning that it will not affect the scientific observations."}

{"text":"\nWe present a model that explains the disappearance of the cosmological quark-deconfined phase transition. The model consists of a simpleeffective potential which at large distance approximates the quark-meson coupling constant and at small distance is an increasing function of the quark-meson coupling constant. The derivative of the potential is anaffine function of the quark-meson coupling constant. We show that this potential has a local minimum at a critical value of the quark-meson coupling constant, which depends only on the ratio of the quark-to-meson masses. We calculate the dependedietric contribution to the effective potential and show that it is negative for a large range of values of the quark-meson coupling constant. This corresponds to the stable deconfined phase. We calculate the dependencquoise function and show that it is positive for a large range of values of the quark-meson coupling constant. This corresponds to the unstable quark-deconfined phase. We show that the stable and unstable phases coexist for a finite range of values of the quark-meson coupling constant. Outside this range the stable phase is unique. We derive a general condition for the disappearance of the quark-deconfined phase transition which does not depend on the specific choice of the effective potential."}
{"text":"\n\nWe investigate the distribution of diameters in random preferential attachment models. We find that the distribution of diameters is very similar to the log-normal distribution, in a way that the mean of the distribution is equal to the largest diameter divided by the total number of nodes. We show that this is a generic property of random preferential attachment models, regardless of the type of preferential attachment and the random seeds. As an application, we show that the empirical distribution of diameters in social networks is consistent with being generated by random preferential attachment models with a small number of random seeds. This provides a simple explanation of the log-normal distribution of diameters in social networks, which was first observed by Barab\u00e1si and Albert, and which has been proposed as a signature of preferential attachment. We also show that the variance of the diameter distribution is larger for small networks, and that this is consistent with the assumption that the tails of the distribution become more heavier as the number of nodes increases."}

The N\u00d7N neutrino mapping matrix is related to the 3\u00d73 quark mixing matrix in a way which allows to deduce the hidden symmetry of the neutrino matrix from the quark mixing matrix. We show that this symmetry is related to the flavor-changing symmetries of the weak interaction. We finally consider a more general case with a wider quark-flavor distribution and a large number N of neutrinos, and we discuss the case of an infinite number N of neutrinos.

{"text":"\nWe have proposed a model in which dark matter is a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) in a frustrated magnetic field. We have shown that the model is capable of producing the correct density distribution for dark matter in the Universe, in addition to other features that are usually considered as inconsistent with a BEC description, such as non-Gaussian statistics and temperature-independent density. We have also proposed a simple model of the evolution of the BEC, in which the dynamic of the BEC formation is related to the evolution of the Universe. Here we present a more realistic model of the evolution of the BEC, which includes the effects of three-body interactions, in which we show that the three-body interactions do not destroy the BEC, as long as a minimum mass for the particles is introduced. We also study the formation of the BEC in a more realistic potential, in which the competition between the BEC and the intermediate-mass particles (IMPs) is taken into account. We show that a BEC of IMPs is formed, instead of the BEC of WIMPs, if the mass of the WIMP is too large. We discuss the possible implications of our results in the context of the dark matter model and the extension of the model to other systems."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present an analysis of the kinematics of stars and gas in the central kiloparsec of Seyfert and inactive host galaxies. We use high-resolution two-dimensional (2D) velocity fields obtained from spectral-image cubes of the 2MASS and SDSS surveys. We find that in both active and inactive galaxies the stellar velocity fields are well described by a single axisymmetric component, and that the gaseous velocity fields are well described by a single component in the active galaxies, but are more complex in the inactive galaxies. In both the stellar and gaseous velocity fields of the active galaxies, the component along the minor axis of the 2D velocity field is typically larger than the component along the major axis. We show that this is consistent with the physical scenario in which the gas is flowing towards the center along the minor axis, and is less efficiently driven out of the system along the major axis. The velocity fields of the inactive galaxies show a more complex structure, and do not display a clear preference for the minor axis. We show this is consistent with the physical scenario in which the gas is likely to be flowing along the major axis, while the stellar component is flowing along the minor axis. We find that the relative velocity dispersion of the gas and stars is systematically higher in the active galaxies, which may indicate a difference in the properties of the gas and stars in the two types of galaxies. Our results suggest that the 2D velocity fields can provide important information on the properties of the gas and stars, and on the mechanisms that drive the dynamical processes in the central region of galaxies."}
{"text":"\nWe present multiwavelength observations of the magnetic field in the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 6946. We combine high-resolution optical polarimetry with archival near-infrared polarimetry and radio measurements to study the large-scale structure of the magnetic field, the distribution of polarity, and the presence of any large-scale helical fields. We find a significant correlation between the location of the optical spiral arms and the local direction of the magnetic field, indicating that the large-scale structure of the magnetic field follows the distribution of young stars. In contrast, the near-infrared depolarization rings, which are centered on the nuclear region, are not associated with any strong magnetic field. We also find that the magnetic field in the disk of NGC 6946 is ordered, likely following the small-scale structure of the disk, but that this field is not helical. Our results suggest that a large-scale helical field may not be a generic feature of spiral galaxies, but may be a feature of galaxies with a particular set of conditions, such as the presence of a bar, that are not present in NGC 6946."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a detailed study of the broad-band spectral evolution of Scorpius X-1 along its color-color diagram. Our analysis is based on a set of 30 white-light observations obtained with the Nordic Optical Telescope between 1999 and 2002. These data reveal a clear evolution of the photospheric spectrum, which can be described by a linear combination of two independent components with different temperature and density structures. We show that the relative contribution of these components varies along the color-color diagram, resulting in a non-monotonic evolution of the spectral shape. This is consistent with a picture where the accretion shock is located at the boundary between the two components, and where the relative contribution of each component depends on the viewing angle. We find that the location of the shock changes as the system evolves, resulting in a slow westward motion of the shock along the color-color diagram. We discuss this finding in the framework of a simple model where the accretion disk is treated as a uniform layer with a given density distribution. Our model explains well the evolution along the color-color diagram, and suggests that the accretion shock is likely to move westward in the near future, possibly leading to a transition to a low-mass X-ray binary."}

We also show that the variance of the number of neighbors in the last jump increases exponentially with the total number of sites in the chain. Our results are consistent with the idea that the dynamics of the random walk is mostly driven by the random choices of the walker to jump to one of the neighboring sites and that the probability of choosing one of the neighbors is inversely proportional to the number of neighbors. We also derive a simple expression for the variance of the number of neighbors in the last jump in terms of the number of neighbors and the total number of sites."}

{"text":"\n\nVSOP: The Variable Star One-shot Project I. Project presentation and first data release.\n\nWe present VSOP, a one-shot variable star observing project using the International Space Station. The project obtained its first observations in January 2017, and in this article we present the project hardware and software, and the first scientific data release. VSOP consists of a camera and a spectrograph, both built by the Italian company CoRIn, installed outside the Columbus module of the International Space Station. The instruments are controlled by the VSOP package, a software suite developed by the VSOP team. VSOP is designed to measure the brightness and color of up to 50,000 stars in our Galaxy, and to obtain high-resolution spectroscopy for up to 1000 stars. The stars will be observed during the twilight zone, when the ISS is in sunlight but the stars are visible, to achieve the best compromise between a large number of stars observed and the quality of the observations. The VSOP data will be used to study stellar brightnesses and colors, to search for new variable stars, to study the structure and kinematics of the Galactic globular clusters, to search for planets around other stars, and to obtain high-resolution spectra of Galactic stars and extra-galactic galaxies. Here we present the first VSOP data release, containing the brightness and color measurements for 100,000 stars in the Galactic globular clusters M5 and M13. The VSOP database will be released to the public after the end of the mission."}
{"text":"\n\nThe AU Microscopii Debris Disk: Multiwavelength Imaging and Modeling\n\nWe present a qualitative and quantitative study of the disk around AU Microscopii (GL 803), which is the first debris disk discovered around an M dwarf. We have imaged the disk in the infrared using the Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) on board the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and in the submillimeter using the SCUBA camera on board the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT). The NIRCam image shows a disk extending to a radius of about 80 AU, with a peak radial density at 50 AU. The SCUBA image shows a disk with a radius of at most 55 AU, with a peak density at 45 AU. We derive an empirical relationship between the observed radial density profile and the mass of the disk. We find that the mass of the disk is between 0.02 and 0.05 Earth masses, depending on the adopted model for the radial density profile. We discuss the difference between the two sets of observations, and we analyze the origin of the extra density seen in the NIRCam image. We derive a mass for the disk that is consistent with the mass of the primary planet, inferred from its reflex motion, assuming that the secondary planet has a mass of 5 Earth masses. We discuss this result in the context of our understanding of the disks around AU Microscopii and AU Microscopii\/GL 803."}
{"text":"\nWe study the occurrence of exotic Mott phases in the extended t--J model on the checkerboard lattice at commensurate densities. We consider the model Hamiltonian in the basis of the transverse Ni-- Cu--Ni--Cu sandwiching structure, where the three types of quasiparticles can be viewed as different combinations of a pair of oppositely charged intruders and a pair of spin--aligned electrons. Our calculations show the existence of a rich set of exotic phases, including a non--collapsing phase with large self--energy and a novel type of charge order as well as a host of different spin--ordered phases, such as the (S, F) and (S, P) phases, the latter of which exhibits a large and tunable band gap. In addition, we find a strong dependence of the properties of these exotic phases on the filling fraction, the nature of the exchange interaction, and the onsite Coulomb repulsion U. The results provide a possible route to engineer novel electronic phases using a combination of lattice and spin degrees of freedom."}
{"text":"\nWe study dynamical diophantine approximation for several types of analytic functions, specifically forrationals, transcendentals, and meromorphic functions.

As a by-product of this analysis we show a generalization of the Resurrection Theorem for rationals to functions of the type we consider."}
{"text":"\nWe report a systematic study of the spin-transfer-torque (STT) vector in magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) with a collinear magnetization configuration, which consists of a ferromagnetic layer, a tunnel barrier, and a ferromagnetic reference layer. The study utilizes a three-terminal MTJ with a READ-mode configuration in which the reference layer is electrically insulated from the sense layer. We found that the three-terminal MTJ can be operated in a STT mode by using a spin-Hall-effect (SHE) layer in the sense layer. The magnitude of the STT torque in the three-terminal MTJ depends on the direction of the sense-layer magnetization with respect to the reference layer. The STT vector can be aligned along the easy axis of the sense layer, the hard axis, or any angle in between, with a resolution of the switching vector of the sense layer. We also found that the STT vector can be rotated by using a combination of a plurality of SHE layers in the sense layer. Our results provide a viable scheme for measuring and manipulating the STT vector in MTJs, which may have applications in spintronic devices."}
{"text":"\n\nSurface plasmon polaritons and surface phonon polaritons on metallic and semiconducting spheres: Exact and semiclassical descriptions\n\nWe consider the interaction of surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) and surface phonon polaritons (SPhPs) with metallic and semiconducting spheres. Using the semiclassical approximation, we obtain a simple and exact description of the SPhP spectrum on a metallic sphere in terms of the incident SPhP wave vector, the radius of the metallic sphere, and the bulk flexural wave velocity of the metallic sphere. This description explains several previous SPhP observations on metallic spheres in a very simple way. By using the same semiclassical approximation, we also obtain a good description of the SPhP dispersion on a semiconducting sphere in terms of the incident SPhP wave vector, the radius of the semiconducting sphere, and the bulk longitudinal wave velocity of the semiconducting sphere. The predicted SPhP spectrum on a semiconducting sphere is in good agreement with recent observations. We also derive a simple expression for the real part of the surface plasmon resonance angle on a metallic sphere as a function of the bulk refractive index of the surrounding medium, the radius of the metallic sphere, and the bulk flexural wave velocity of the metallic sphere. We show that this expression can be used to accurately predict the real part of the surface plasmon resonance angle on a metallic sphere for a large range of bulk refractive indices and sphere radii if the bulk flexural wave velocity is known."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider the controllability of the heat and wave equations and their finite difference approximations by the shape of the domain. The motivating example is thescribbling of a line on a piece of paper. If the line is straight, then it is easy to predict the shape of the line after it has been drawn (it is a straight line). However, if the line is curved, then it is not so easy to predict the shape of the line after it has been drawn (it is a curve). We show that the ability to predict the shape of a solution to the heat or wave equation after an initial condition has been imposed is equivalent to the ability to control the solution by the shape of the domain. As such, the study of controllability by the shape of the domain is a natural generalization of the classical study of control by a line of observations. In particular, we show that the set of initial conditions that can be controlled by a particular shape is equivalent to the set of lines that can be drawn on the domain without ever having to lift the pen. For the heat equation, we show that the set of initial conditions that can be controlled by the shape of the domain is equivalent to the set of lines that can be drawn on the domain using only one intersection with each boundary. For the wave equation, we show that the set of initial conditions that can be controlled by the shape of the domain is equivalent to the set of lines that can be drawn on the domain without ever having to lift the pen and such that the total curvature is always $\\ge 0$. As an application, we consider the finite difference approximations to the heat and wave equations defined by different meshes on the domain. We show that, in a natural sense, the controllability by the shape of the domain is equivalent to the accuracy of the approximation. As such, the study of controllability by the shape of the domain provides a way to understand the properties of the solution to the heat and wave equations on a general domain."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present predictions, derived from a simple model, for the period distribution of triple star systems in globular clusters. We show that the period distribution is strongly non-normal, with a peak at very short periods and a long tail extending to periods much longer than the cluster's lifetime. The model also predicts that the probability of finding a short-period triple is inversely proportional to the cube of the cluster's age. Hence the number of triple stars with periods shorter than a few thousand years decreases very rapidly with cluster age. We show that the few known triple stars in globular clusters that have a short period and a relatively high orbital eccentricity are likely to be members of an elite group of triple stars with inner orbits, and that they are probably close to or in their first-inversion state. We argue that these inner-orbital triples are likely to be the survivors of a much larger population of short-period triples that have had their orbits excited by a giant planet or a brown dwarf. We conclude that the period distribution of triple stars in globular clusters can provide useful information about the dynamical history of these clusters, the exchange of material between stars, and the evolution of their orbital elements."}
{"text":"\nSecond-Order Type Isomorphisms Through Game Semantics\n\nWe show that every second-order type theory with free second-order variables is isomorphic to a theory of games with perfect information and initial positions that are fixed by a finite set of symmetry conditions. We draw a connection between the game-theoretic interpretation of type theory and the standard interpretation of first-order logic. We show that every game that can be interpreted as a second-order type theory has a natural symmetry-based Initial Condition. We introduce a new class of games called Perfect-Information Symmetric Games (PISG) and show that every game in this class has a natural type theory interpretation. We show that, although PISG are closed under backward induction, they are not closed under induction in general. We present a general procedure for constructing a PISG and use this procedure to construct the Generalized Majority Game, which is a PISG with the additional property that, if all players but one have the same strategy, the remaining player can force a draw by repeatedly choosing his own strategy."}
{"text":"\nWe study the effect of a non-zero magnetic field on the symmetry of the spontaneous Fermi surface in a metal. We consider a system in which the underlying symmetry of the lattice is broken by an external field, and show that this breaks also the symmetry of the resulting Fermi surface. We find that the resulting Fermi surface is very sensitive to the underlying lattice symmetry, the strength of the field, and the type of thesymmetry breaking. Our results are consistent with the notion that the formation of a non-trivial Fermi surface is a consequence of the spontaneous symmetry breaking, and that the only symmetry of the Fermi surface is that of the underlying lattice. We also show that in a lattice with a non-trivial symmetry, the resulting Fermi surface is not necessarily symmetric.\n\nSymmetry breaking is at the heart of many processes in physics, from the breaking of fundamental symmetries in the early universe to the dynamics of quantum systems. Spontaneous Fermi surface symmetry breaking is a consequence of the breaking of the symmetry of the lattice by the presence of a non-zero magnetic field. We show that in a lattice with a non-trivial symmetry, the resulting Fermi surface is not necessarily symmetric. We find that the Fermi surface is very sensitive to the underlying lattice symmetry, the strength of the field, and the type of the symmetry breaking.

{"text":"\n\nWe consider the stability of viscous shocks in gas dynamics. We establish a criterion for the stability of a shock in terms of the rate of change of the shock velocity and the ratio of the specific heat at constant pressure to the specific heat at constant volume. This criterion is consistent with the stability analysis of James, in which the stability of the shock is linked to the energy dissipation rate. We show that the energy dissipation rate is proportional to the rate of change of the shock velocity, and the proportionality constant depends only on the ratio of the specific heat at constant pressure to the specific heat at constant volume. This allows us to express the stability criterion in terms of these two specific heat ratios. We show that the energy dissipation rate is non-negative for stable shocks, and we obtain a condition for the energy dissipation rate to be zero, which is equivalent to the stability criterion. We confirm the accuracy of our analysis by comparing our results with results obtained using a direct numerical method."}
{"text":"\n\nAccurate description of optical precursors and their relation to weak-field coherent optical transients\n\nWe present an accurate theoretical description of the optical precursor phenomenon. The description is based on a rigorous analysis of the dynamics of a laser pulse as it passes through a spatially extended pre- fibre. We show that a full description of the precursor requires an accurate solution of the optical wave equation in a spatially extended system. The solution is found by using the correct form of the relaxation of the pulse to the radiation pressure, which is shown to be different for different pulse shapes. We show that the correct relaxation of the pulse results in the evolution of a complex spatial pattern of field intensity, which contains information about the dynamics of the system. The description is confirmed by a comparison with previously published results, which used an approximate description of the precursor. We also present a simple and exact description of the relation between the precursor and the coherent transient that follows it."}
{"text":"\n\nWe study the maximal amount of gravitational waves in the scenario where the only relevant degrees of freedom are the two-body degrees of freedom of a collapsed object and the cosmological constant. Our main result is that this maximal amount is finite, regardless of the type of the model (static, oscillating or swirling) and the physical constants. We show that the minimal energy of the gravitational field in this scenario is $m_{min} \\sim M_{Pl}^2\/\\gamma_{Pl}$, where $M_{Pl}$ is the Planck mass and $\\gamma_{Pl}$ is the Planck gravitational constant, and that this minimal energy can be achieved by a static spherical object with radius $R_{max} \\sim M_{Pl}$. In this case, the gravity waves have the frequency $\\omega \\sim 1\/R$, and their amplitude is $\\epsilon \\sim 1\/2$. We also show that the static, oscillating and swirling objects are locally equivalent, and that every static object has an oscillating counterpart, which is related to it by a rotation around the static object's symmetry axis."}
{"text":"\nWe consider the effect of a resonator on the transient response of a flexible cantilever \"strinking outwards\" reed. The transient response is a superposition of the oscillations of the reed and the resonator. We show that the transient response can be described by two different ways, depending on the relative magnitude of the natural frequency of the reed and that of the resonator. If the natural frequency of the resonator is much smaller than that of the reed, the transient response can be described by a single wavelength of the reed's natural frequency. If the resonator's natural frequency is not much smaller than that of the reed, the transient response is a superposition of the waveforms of the two natural frequencies, with a beat frequency given by the difference between the two natural frequencies. We evaluate the threshold value of the resonator's natural frequency for which the transient response switches from the single-wavelength description to the superposition description. We show that this threshold is given by the condition that the resonator's natural frequency is equal to twice the reed's natural frequency. We also derive a simple expression for the magnitude of the beat frequency in the superposition description."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate the stability of isentropic viscous shock profiles in the high-Mach number limit. We show that the linear theory of small perturbations applied to the inviscid Euler system results in a linear system of ordinary differential equations with constant coefficients, which can be solved analytically to obtain a general solution. The resulting small-disturbance theory has two distinct regimes, one of which is stable and the other is unstable. We evaluate the growth rate of the unstable regime and show that it has a singularity at the so-called Dictionary's velocity, which marks the transition between the stable and unstable regimes. Within the stable regime, the small-disturbance solution is shown to be stable with respect to the so-called boiling-induced disturbances, which are modeled as a random field with a power-law spectrum. We evaluate the statistical properties of the small-disturbance solution in the stable regime, and show that it displays the so-called Forrest-Woods-Pope (FWP) Statistics, which is a generalization of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov Statistics to a stationary random field with a power-law spectrum."}
{"text":"\n\nWe introduce a new family of algorithms for extracting topological structure from large complex networks that are believed to be scale-free or small-world in their connectivity distribution. Our approach is based on finding the smallest subgraph that is a good approximation of the original network in terms of several well-defined graph properties. We show that for a large class of networks, the size of this approximation subgraph is proportional to the logarithm of the number of nodes in the network. Furthermore, the number of edges in this subgraph is guaranteed to be at most twice the number of edges in the largest clique in the network. We implement our algorithm in a computer program called Quasyclique, and evaluate its efficiency on several real-world networks. In terms of the quality of the extracted subgraph, we show that our algorithm is guaranteed to extract the clique that contains the largest number of nodes, and that this clique contains at most one edge per node, on average. We also show that our algorithm extracts the clique that is the best approximation to the network in terms of the number of cliques it contains. Our algorithm runs in time proportional to the square of the number of nodes in the network."}

The purpose of this article is to discuss some of the principal ideas Einstein contributed to the field of physics, in the light of the latest advances in the subject. In the article we review the development of the theory of relativity and quantum mechanics, two theories which have revolutionised our understanding of the universe, and which, together with the work of Einstein, have laid the foundations for the current theory of the universe.\n\nIn the early years of the twentieth century, the development of physics was characterised by the search for a single theory that would unify the laws of physics, and which would describe the behaviour of all types of matter and energy. The first attempt to develop such a theory was made by Einstein in 1905, with his theory of relativity. This theory revolutionised our understanding of space and time, and laid the foundations for the current theory of the universe.\n\nEinstein's theory of relativity was followed by the development of quantum mechanics, which described the behaviour of subatomic particles, and which has also had a major impact on our understanding of the universe. The two theories, relativity and quantum mechanics, are now known as the theory of general relativity and the theory of quantum mechanics, and are the basis for our current understanding of the universe.\n\nIn the article we review the development of these two theories, and discuss some of the key ideas which have emerged from them. We also discuss the current state of the field, and the future directions of research."}

{"text":"\n\nWe present a statistical study of the polarimetric properties of 15 active galactic nuclei (AGN) observed at high frequencies (20-40 GHz) using the Owens Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO) 10-element digital array. We find that the nuclear polarization is correlated with other nuclear properties such as the continuum flux and the Fanaroff-Riley classification (F-R), but the correlations are not strong. We show that the largest polarization values are found in galaxies with very low neutral hydrogen content, which could indicate that the low-frequency (1-10 GHz) polarization is produced in the accretion disc and the high-frequency polarization is produced in the inner part of the broad line region. We also show that the relative angle between the polarization vectors of the radio continuum and the polarized broad line region emission is on average 90 deg, which could indicate that the two sets of emission are produced in spatially distinct regions. The observed distributions of the angle between the polarization vectors and the radial distribution of the polarized broad line region emission are consistent with the blobs being spatially random with respect to the host galaxy. We also present a method to retrieve the angle between the polarization vectors from an image without knowing the absolute polarimetric calibration."}
{"text":"\n\nSuperluminous supernovae: No threat from Eta Carinae\nWe present photometry and spectroscopy of the bright supernova (SN) 2008ha, which occurred in the distant galaxy Eta Carinae. From our high-resolution spectroscopy, we derive the atmospheric parameters and the explosion energy of the supernova. We find that this supernova, although extremely bright, had a very low mass, with an estimated total hydrogen mass of M_Solar, and a kinetic energy in the form of rest mass energy of only 6 x 10^51 erg. This makes it by far the least massive and least energetic supernova known. We discuss this object in the framework of the theory of superluminous supernovae, and find that the observations are consistent with a non-thermally driven event, perhaps related to the recently proposed special kind of supernova, the SN 2000cx-like event. We show that a simple model in which the accretion onto the companion star is suddenly interrupted can explain most of the observations. We conclude that there is no evidence that SN 2008ha was more energetic than a normal SN, and that therefore it poses no threat to Earth."}

{"text":"\nWe compare the rest-frame optical luminosity functions (LFs) predicted by a simple galaxy formation model with the LFs observed by the 2MASS Redshift Survey (2MRS) at 2.0<z<3.3. We find that the model is successful at producing an LF that agrees with observations in the sense that the model predicts a nonlinear decline in the mean luminosity with increasing redshift that is consistent with the observed decline. However, the predicted LF has a higher slope than the observed LF at intermediate redshifts (z<1), and a shallower slope at high redshift (z>1). These discrepancies are explained by the model's inability to produce the observed excess of luminous galaxies at low redshift and the observed deficiency of luminous galaxies at high redshift. A model modification that includes a feedback mechanism to regulate the star formation rate produces a better agreement with the observations, but does not completely solve the problem. We also compare the LFs produced by the model with the observed LFs from the 6dF Galaxy Redshift Survey (6dFGR) and find the model predicts a different shape for the LF than observed by 6dFGR. We explain this discrepancy by the different galaxy selections in the two surveys."}

We show that such a system can, in general, be reduced to a single orbit that is always extremely close to the equilibrium orbit with the smallest apsis. We call this orbit the \\\"Shrinking Binaries\\\". We derive a simple analytic formula for the orbital elements of the Shrinking Binaries as a function of the mass of the largest satellite. In the case of apsidal orbits with two large satellites, we show that the system can be reduced to a single orbit that is an elongated ellipse with the smallest apsis and the largest satellite always at the same point. We call this orbit the \\\"Planetary Orbits\\\". We derive a simple analytic formula for the orbital elements of the Planetary Orbits as a function of the masses of the two largest satellites. We show that both the Shrinking Binaries and the Planetary Orbits can be obtained as special cases of the solution of the Three Body Problem with tidal friction. As such, the orbits are subject to the same caveats as the solution to the Three Body Problem: the evolution is not completely chaos-free, and the orbits are not fully stable. In particular, we show that both orbits can evolve into the full three-body solution with three identical bodies in a collinear configuration, which is the most dynamically unstable configuration in the three-body problem. We also discuss the possible physical interpretations of the Shrinking Binaries and the Planetary Orbits."}
{"text":"\n\nA Ground-Based Search for Thermal Emission from the Exoplanet TrES-1\n\nWe present the results of a ground-based search for thermal emission from the exoplanet TrES-1. We observed the TrES-1 system with the InfraRed Camera (IRC) on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and the Multiplexed Instrument for Reconnaissance and Surveillance (MINER) on the United States Air Force's Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) F-16 satellite. We have derived the spectral energy distribution of the TrES-1 system from the HST observations, and the absolute photometric magnitudes of both the primary star and the exoplanet from the DMSP observations. We find that the system's spectral energy distribution is consistent with a blackbody at 536 K with a brightness temperature ofTR<18 kelvins, but the shape of the spectral energy distribution is not consistent with a star with a temperature ofTR>5,000 kelvins. We therefore conclude that the exoplanet TrES-1 has a temperature of approximately TR>36 kelvins. We find that the exoplanet has a diameter of 1.3 \u00b1 0.1 RJ, where RJ is the Rossij stadium, which implies a density of \u03c1<5.1g cm-3, assuming a rocky composition. We find that the mass of the exoplanet is m<8.6 MJ, which is less than the minimum mass for a hydrogen-atum planet. We therefore conclude that the exoplanet is not a hydrogen-atum planet. We discuss the implications of our results for the radiative properties of exoplanet atmospheres."}

We show that this centroid matching problem can be framed as a classification task, and propose a new distance measure which has the property that the classification boundary is the solution to a well-posed optimization problem. We evaluate our method on a set of synthetic data and a set of real data from the Mercedes-Benz fashion collection, and show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both data sets.\n\nWe consider the problem of matching clusters across different sets of data points, where the clusters are represented by their centroids.

{"text":"\nWe show that the recently reported GeV anomaly in the energy distribution of the highest energy photons in the Earth's radiation belt is likely caused by a resonant interaction between the second Earth's rotational harmonic and the electron belt. We calculate the energy distribution of the radiation belt electrons and find that it is in agreement with the observations of the GeV anomaly, which we show is most likely caused by a single, narrow, approximately 1 Hz wide, resonance. We discuss several mechanisms that could have excited this resonance and arrive at the conclusion that the most likely one is a nonlinear instability of the electron motion induced by a distant magnetic field source. We estimate the energy flux that such a process could inject into the electron belt and find that it is large enough to account for the observed anomaly. We also show that the energy distribution of the electrons has a significant harmonics content and that the existence of a 1 Hz wide resonance could explain the presence of harmonics up to a few percent of the fundamental. We discuss the physical origin of the harmonics and find that they could be induced by several physical processes that are active in the electron belt."}
{"text":"\nWe present here the results of a theoretical investigation of the projectile fragmentation of $^{86}$Kr at 64 MeV\/nucleon. The motivation for this work is the recent experiment of Shinozaki et al. which observed the appearance of $^{88}$Rb and $^{90}$Sr in the debris from the collision of a 64 MeV\/nucleon $^{86}$Kr projectile with a gold target. We solve the many-body problem for the projectile fragmentation using the molecular dynamics method. The $^{86}$Kr molecule is treated as a compound system consisting of two $^{36}$Kr atoms. We found that the structure of the $^{86}$Kr molecule is stabilized by the pairing interaction, and that the molecular dissociation threshold is about 8 MeV\/nucleon. We also found that the individual $^{36}$Kr atoms are more loosely bound than the $^{86}$Kr molecule, and that the $^{36}$Kr atoms are almost collision-free at the incident kinetic energy of 64 MeV\/nucleon. Therefore, we conclude that the appearance of $^{88}$Rb and $^{90}$Sr in the Shinozaki et al. experiment was due to the dissociation and subsequent collisional ionization of the $^{86}$Kr molecule, and that the $^{36}$Kr atom did not contribute to the formation of the detected nuclei."}
{"text":"\nWe give a fundamental explanation for the tiny value of the cosmological constant based on the properties of the resting state in statistical mechanics. We show that the huge entropy of the resting state implies a small value for the cosmological constant in order to keep the number of statistical equilibrium states positive. Our explanation is based on a simple example of a model with a variable number of cells which has a continuous range of energy levels and in which the number of cells is proportional to the number of statistical equilibrium states. The fact that the number of cells is very large and the number of statistical equilibrium states is very small implies a small value for the cosmological constant. Our explanation has a clear physical origin and it does not require any precise quantitative input from the theory. In this way our explanation differs from the explanation proposed by Eisenbud and Ward (letter to the editor, Phys. Rev. D, 67, 123512 (2003)) based on the Bogoliubov spectrum which requires a very precise value for the mass of the elementary particle."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a theoretical study of the speed of sound in a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) in an optical lattice. We find that the speed of sound has a minimum in the thermodynamic limit as a function of the inter-atomic spacing. This is due to an instability of the phonon dispersion relation in the limit of large thermal wavelength. We show that the same effect can be obtained by a simple modification of the standard Gross-Pitaevskii model, which allows us to analytically evaluate the speed of sound in this limit. Our results are consistent with the recent observation of unusual sound speeds in a BEC in an optical lattice, which was interpreted as a consequence of the interatomic force growing faster than the thermal force.

{"text":"\n\nMixed-up trees: the structure of phylogenetic mixtures.\n\nThe study of mixture data has recently become a topic of intense interest in statistical physics, statistical genetics, and computer science. We review some results on the structure of phylogenetic mixtures from our own work and that of others, and discuss some open problems. We also introduce a new model that captures several features of phylogenetic mixtures that are not captured by the traditional model of mixtures of rooted trees. This model can be thought of as a generalization of the traditional model to the setting of unrooted trees, but it also has a direct interpretation in terms of a game between a \"top down\" and a \"bottom up\" process that compete to build a phylogenetic tree. The game has a unique solution that is characterized by a simple condition on the degree of the leaves. We show that this condition is satisfied for a wide class of real data sets. We also show that the simplest non-trivial case of our model, the setting of a constant degree for all leaves, is closely related to the setting of a single rooted tree with an internal node, and that the statistics of this setting satisfy the same restrictions as the statistics of a rooted tree."}
{"text":"\n\nWe study the statistics of avalanches in the multifractal random walk. We find that the avalanche size distribution can be well described by a power law, with the same power as the one describing the random walk itself. This is in sharp contrast to the case of the simple random walk, where the avalanche size distribution has a heavy tail, with a power law tail index strictly greater than one. We show that this result can be understood from the fact that the random walk can be decomposed in a large number of independent (but not identically distributed) random walks, each with its own power law avalanche size distribution. The respective contributions to the total number of avalanches of size S are independent, each following a Poisson distribution with mean number of avalanches per time step equal to the total number of random walks divided by the number of independent random walks. We show that the number of independent random walks is proportional to the two-fold integral over the non-negative integers of a function which is related to the distance from the origin to the nearest pole of the PDF of the random walk. The respective contributions to the total number of avalanches of size S are therefore also scale-free, following a power law distribution."}
{"text":"\nWe present a new concept for describing the electronic structure and motion within a helium atom. Our approach is based on a relativistic spacetime description, which takes into account the actual dynamics of the electrons. Within this framework we show that the electrons in a helium atom can be mapped onto a four-dimensional spacetime structure that we call the electronic space. The construction of this space relies on a thorough mathematical analysis of the Hamiltonian and the solution space of the corresponding Schr\u00f6dinger equation. The resulting electronic space has a very simple structure and allows a unique and intuitive description of both the static and the dynamic properties of the electrons. For example, we show that the electronic space can be fully described by only two functions, which are related to the two fundamental quantum states of the helium atom. We also analyze the dynamic behavior of the electrons and show that the electronic space is in general a very complex and asymmetric structure, which reflects the rich and interesting dynamics of the electrons. In particular we show that the electronic motion can be understood in terms of a constant effort to maximize the spacetime distance between the electrons, which is in conflict with the constraint that they must remain close to the nucleus. The competition between these two tendencies results in a rich variety of dynamic behavior, which is reflected in the complex structure of the electronic space."}
{"text":"\nWe study a class of probabilistic cellular automata, called probabilistic Boolean networks, that are motivated by questions of information processing in the nervous system. We show that these probabilistic Boolean networks, unlike their deterministic counterparts, can robustly perform sophisticated forms of information processing without unique normal forms. We consider a randomness extraction task, the performance of which would imply that the system is able to get rid of Gaussian noise added to its inputs. The ability to perform such a task is shown to be equivalent to the ability to perform a computation that is universal in the probabilistic setting. We then show that this type of universality can be guaranteed by a large class of probabilistic Boolean networks, as long as the connections are randomly chosen according to a suitable probability distribution. Our results imply that, in the probabilistic setting, the concepts of computation and randomness are intertwined in a subtle way."}
{"text":"\nWe propose a theory for few-fermion systems which are driven by a stochastic dynamics and trapped in a weakly disordered environment. The theory is based on the effective two-level system approach. We consider the limiting case of a large number of fermionic quasiparticles, which describes the system at a thermodynamic limit. We show that such a system is in a delicate balance between the particle and the wave dynamics. We consider two different types of the few-fermion systems: the one with a non-degenerate ground state and the one with a degenerate ground state. In the first case, we show that the system is stable against a sudden arrest of the drive and the ground state stays the same. In the second case, we show that such a system is not stable and the ground state spontaneously changes depending on the details of the dynamics and the type of the disorder. The theory is tested on the example of a single trapped ion, which is driven by a stochastic dynamics and is in a weakly disordered environment."}
{"text":"\n\nAims:\n\nWe aim to better understand the formation and evolution of gas giant planets, in particular their masses and radii, by analyzing a large set of exoplanet data from the last two decades.\n\nMethods:\n\nWe have performed a systematic study of the masses and radii of gas giant planets using the database of exoplanets discovered over the last two decades. We use theParsing Chunks of Cupcakes algorithm to estimate the masses of these exoplanets, and the DAOPHOT method to estimate their radii. We find that the inferred masses of these exoplanets are in good agreement with the masses of the giant planets in the solar system, and that the radii are larger than those in the solar system, but they are consistent with the assumption that these exoplanets have the same internal structure as the solar system giant planets. We also compare our results with previous studies, and discuss the origin of the inferred exoplanet masses and radii.\n\nResults:\n\nWe have found that the masses of gas giant exoplanets are in good agreement with the masses of the giant planets in the solar system, within the uncertainty limits. We have also found that their radii are typically larger than those in the solar system, but that this can be explained by assuming that they have the same internal structure as the solar system giant planets.\n\nConclusions:\n\nOur results suggest that the gas giant exoplanets have formed through the same mechanism as the giant planets in the solar system, and that they have not formed through other mechanisms, such as the accretion of large amounts of gas from the protoplanetary disk. Our results also suggest that the gas giant exoplanets have not suffered a significant internal rearrangement of their interior structure."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a model of hierarchical clustering of galaxies in a genericified version of the analogues of the Department of Energy nuclear soups. In our model, the galaxies are galaxies analogues, embedded in a Feedback from the underlying Soup, and moving under the influence of an external potential field. We find that the galaxies form a hierarchy of clusters, with the clusters getting denser and more compact as we go from the outskirts to the core. We find that the number of clusters in the hierarchy is a decreasing function of the size of the space. We also find that the model is stable againstAdding an extra field in the potential field (i.e. making the system more difficult to relax to a minimum of free energy) makes the hierarchy more compact. We also found that the model is stable againstAdding noise to the dynamics of the galaxies, i.e. adding an extra source of randomness to the dynamics of the galaxies. We discuss the model in the framework of the assumptions made, and comment on the similarities with the current theory on galaxy formation."}
{"text":"\n\nWe have performed 3D hydrodynamic simulations with the Einstein code on collapses of spherical 23-73Msun clumps of pure iron surrounded by a shell of hydrogen. We find that a dipole magnetic field of 0.01-0.1G is generated by the accretion shock heating the core and eventually the core becomes a neutron star. We have also studied the effect of adding a small fraction (2-25%) of heavy elements (e.g. iron) to the core composition. The same mechanism of generating a magnetic field and the formation of a spherically symmetric black hole is found. We have compared our results with previous 2D results and found good agreement. Our 3D results show a small difference from the 2D results in the form of a small tail in the distribution of the core's radius and a small leakage of the magnetic field through the poles. We have also investigated the effect of the neutrino emission on the evolution of the core. We find that the neutrinos have a negligible effect on the dynamics of the core and the formation of the magnetic field, but they have a strong effect on the temperature distribution. The temperature distribution in the core is very non-uniform, with the temperature increasing towards the center. The maximum temperature in the core is about 2.5keV, which is close to the estimated threshold for the neutrino emission. We find that the energy budget of the neutrinos is in agreement with the one obtained from the 2D results, in spite of the fact that the energy distribution in 3D is very non-uniform."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate resonant spin polarization in a two-dimensional hole gas, subject to the Luttinger term, structural inversion asymmetry, and Zeeman splitting. We calculate the polarimetric transmission and reflection coefficients, as well as the phase and the intensity of the reflected light for a square-wave grating, in the presence of an external magnetic field. Our results show that, in the limit of small grating modulation amplitude, the polarimetric response is governed by the Luttinger term and structural asymmetry, while the Zeeman splitting has a strong effect on the non-zero order reflection coefficients. We also found that the penetration depth of the incident electromagnetic field, as well as the hole gas thickness have a large effect on the reflectivity and the phase of the reflected light. Our results are consistent with the notion that the resonant spin-selective transmission and reflection are due to an effective increase of the index of refraction and the thickness of the hole gas, respectively."}
{"text":"\nWe present integral field spectroscopy of the extended emission-line region (EELR) of 4C 37.43, a bright and nearby galaxy in the optical state, with the aim of characterizing the ionization structure of its extended atmosphere. We observe a strong correlation between ionization and stellar content: the ionized gas is mostly located in the regions of the galaxy that contain young and massive stars. In addition, we find that the ionization structure is extremely regular, with the ionization probability decreasing in a radial fashion from the galaxy's center. We interpret this radial decline as due to the combined effect of a large-scale ionization wave and the superposition of many small-scale localised ionization sources, the latter most likely related to the massive star-forming regions. We have verified that this radial decrease in ionization probability is not due to dust obscuration. Our results suggest that a simple model in which ionization is driven by a single wave of ionization originating in the galaxy's centre cannot account for the ionization structure of the EELR."}
{"text":"\nWe consider a simple model of bacterial growth in which the local population density depends linearly on the local nutrient concentration, and the nutrient diffusion is described by the Keller-Segel equation. We find that the population density has a critical value, below which the population dies out, and above which the population continues to grow. This critical density has a simple expression in terms of the coefficients of the Keller-Segel equation. We show that this critical density has an analogy in the theory of white dwarf stars. In particular, the limiting mass of a white dwarf, below which the star collapses to a neutron star or a black hole, has the same form as the critical density of the bacterial population. We also consider a more general model in which the local population density depends on the local nutrient concentration in a more complicated way. In this case, the critical density has a more involved form, but still has an analogy with the limiting mass of white dwarf stars."}
{"text":"\nWe generate minimally coupled Einstein- scalar field solutions from vacuum solutions with arbitrary cosmological constant. The motivation for this work is to investigate the effects of a cosmological constant on the structure of space-times with scalar fields. We find that the presence of a cosmological constant can significantly alter the structure of space-times, compared to the case without a cosmological constant. In particular, we find that the space-times with a positive cosmological constant tend to be more compact, while the space-times with a negative cosmological constant tend to be more expansive. We also find that the space-times with a positive cosmological constant can be classified into three types, depending on the sign of the scalar field, while the space-times with a negative cosmological constant can be classified into two types, depending on the sign of the scalar field. In addition, we find that the space-times with a positive cosmological constant tend to be more stable, while the space-times with a negative cosmological constant tend to be less stable."}
{"text":"\nWe show that Albert Einstein's special theory of relativity, published in 1905, and the development of the fundamental ideas of quantum mechanics, published between 1907 and 1913, had a strong impact on the evolution of modern art, particularly on the works produced by the cubists, the futurists, and the expressionists. We analyze the scientific and artistic works of Einstein and the artists Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque, Auguste Rodin, Donatello, Umberto Boccioni, Giacomo Balla, and Vassily Kandinsky, among others. We find that there are many symptomatic analogies between the scientific and artistic works produced in the first half of the twentieth century. In particular, we focus on the use of the idea of \"perspective\" and on the analysis of the relationship between space and time in the framework of Einstein's special theory of relativity, and we show that these concepts influenced the works of the artists we consider. In addition, we find that the idea of \"probability\" and \"uncertainty\" related to the quantum mechanics developed by Werner Heisenberg and Paul Dirac influenced the way artists represented their ideas. We show that the artists we consider were well aware of the scientific theories developed by Einstein and Heisenberg, and we find that they used some of the main ideas of these theories in their works."}
{"text":"\n\nWe have developed a method, based on the formalism of Local Space Discrimination Analysis (LSDA), for identifying the dominant structural distortions in a given material, and for extracting the corresponding model Hamiltonian parameters in a tight-binding description. We applied this method to the study of the structural and electronic properties of LaMnO_3, a prototypical Heisenberg antiferromagnetic material, for which the ground state is known to beDistorted Cubic. The method is based on the analysis of the data obtained from Mossbauer spectroscopy and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). We show that the dominant structural distortions in LaMnO_3 are a nine-fold rotation and a monoclinic distortion of the cubic lattice. The nine-fold rotation is related to the observed hour-glass-like magnetic behavior, and the monoclinic distortion is related to the existence of a gap in the magnetic excitation spectrum. We discuss the relationship between the dominant structural distortions and the model Hamiltonian parameters in a tight-binding description."}
{"text":"\n\nPlasma Modes Along the Open Field Lines of a Neutron Star\nWe consider the spatial structure of plasma modes in a spherically symmetric, self-similar, and stationary capacitively coupled plasma (CCP) with cylindrical symmetry along the field lines of a static point charge located at the center. We show that the plasma impedance boundary conditions are satisfied by a plasma mode structure in which the plasma has a linear density distribution along the open field lines, and a spherically symmetric density distribution with a radial gap from the field lines. The frequency of this mode is related to the inverse of the radial gap. This mode structure may be relevant to the structure of the electron plasma in the inner magnetosphere, where the electric field lines are open to the solar wind. We show that this plasma mode may be stable against a temperature gradient along the field lines, if the temperature is low. We discuss possible applications of this plasma mode structure to laboratory plasmas, and we show that this plasma mode may be stabilized by a weak electric field applied to a part of the plasma volume."}

{"text":"\nWe consider the problem of a modified Coulomb potential in a strong magnetic field. We show that such a problem can be reduced to the study of the structure of the integral kernel of the corresponding integral equation. The kernel has a very simple structure in the case of a delta-pinning, which is a model of a point-like defect in a metal. The exact solution of the integral equation in this case is found. The solution of the modified integral equation with a general non-delta kernel is found in the framework of the WKB approximation. The form of the solution in this case is different from the delta-pinning case and has a singularity of the first kind.

The films were grown by pulsed laser deposition and their structure, microstructure, and magnetic properties were investigated. The film thickness was determined by measuring the step height between the film surface and the substrate. Film thickness was in the range of 0.4\u20130.7 \u03bcm. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis showed that the films were single phase and the XRD peak intensity ratios of the film to the substrate were in the range of 0.38\u20130.61, indicating that the film crystallinity was higher than that of the substrate. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the film surface showed that the surface was relatively flat with small hills and valleys, and the average surface roughness was 1.6 nm. Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) mapping showed that the elements were homogeneously distributed on the film. The magnetic properties of the films were investigated by using a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer at 300 K. The magnetization curve of the film showed hysteresis and the coercivity was in the range of 50\u2013150 Oe. The results showed that the epitaxial thin films of Bi2FeCrO6 were successfully grown on SrTiO3 and Si (100) substrates, and that the films had a single phase, high crystallinity, and a good magnetic properties."}
{"text":"\n\nWe study the structure of semiclassical propagators in backgrounds with non-trivial topology.

In particular, we show that the general semiclassical propagator can be expressed as a linear combination of a particular set of basis functions which form a basis set which is both orthonormal and complete with respect to the inner product defined by the semi- Dirac delta function. This basis set is shown to be related to the underlying field theory of the background.

{"text":"\n\nWe present the results of a study of the potential of the US long baseline neutrino experiment to measure the Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagami (PMN) neutrinos from radioactive neutrino sources in the northern hemisphere. The long baseline experiment consists of two detectors placed at opposite ends of a very large baseline, on the order of thousands of kilometers. The main purpose of the experiment is to measure the energy and flavor content of atmospheric neutrinos at the highest possible statistical significance and with the smallest possible systematic errors. This measurement can provide a direct determination of the neutrino mass and could also provide a precise measurement of the differences in the three neutrino masses. In addition to atmospheric neutrinos, the long baseline experiment is also sensitive to neutrinos from a number of other sources, including the PMN sources. We describe the simulation and analysis methods used to evaluate the capability of the long baseline experiment to measure the PMN neutrinos. We find that the experiment has the potential to measure the PMN neutrinos with a significance of a few sigma within a few years of operation and with a better sensitivity than any currently proposed dedicated PMN experiment."}

{"text":"\n\nWe present Spitzer-IRAC GLIMPSE (Great Lyon's probe for the inner and mid-plane structure of protoplanetary objects) results for 42 high mass protostellar objects (HMPSOs), and find a strong correlation between the mid-IR and far-IR colors of the HMPSOs. The mid-IR colors show a well-defined difference between compact and extended sources. The compact HMPSOs are characterized by a blue color, while the extended sources are red. The difference in color is such that we can identify unambiguously the nature of the observed HMPSOs in the mid-IR, independently of the resolution. We conclude that the mid-IR color is a powerful tool to study the inner structure of the HMPSOs, and the far-IR a powerful tool to study the outer structure. The correlation between the mid-IR and far-IR colors can be explained by a simple model in which the compact HMPSOs are surrounded by a cold inner layer, and the extended sources are embedded in a hot outer layer. We show that the ratio of the far-IR to mid-IR colors is a strong indicator of the mass of the inner object. Our results suggest that the mass of the inner object is a key parameter in the formation and evolution of HMPSOs, with the mass distribution in the inner few AU possibly controlling the accretion process.\n\nWe present a model in which the non-LTE spectrum of a HMPSO is the sum of the spectra of the inner and outer objects, weighted by the distance $r$.

{"text":"\nWe study the lifetime of a bouncing droplet in a hot bath. The system is simplified by assuming that the droplet is inviscid and has a constant volume, and that the forces it experiences are due only to the impact of its surface on the bath. The impact forces are such that the droplet's vertical velocity is nearly constant, with small random fluctuations. The droplet's lifetime is related to the statistical properties of its vertical velocity and its diffusion in the horizontal direction. We show that a simple model of the droplet's lifetime, based on the relaxation of its velocity to a steady value, is in good agreement with numerical results for droplets with a wide range of volumes. For a given droplet volume, we find that the lifetime is inversely proportional to the droplet's initial horizontal velocity. We also find that the lifetime is directly proportional to the temperature of the bath and to the cube of the droplet's volume.

The campaign was designed to probe the nature of the source's optical and ultraviolet (UV) emission, which had been interpreted as due to a circum-stellar disk. We find that the photometry is best explained by a ring of dust around the magnetar, with a radius of 55\u201370 R\u2299 and an inner-gap of >5 R\u2299. We determine the magnetar's distance to be 4.7 kpc, in agreement with other recent distance measurements. We discuss this disk\/ring as the likely source of the radio emission and find that the measured radio flux is consistent with the thermal emission from a disk\/ring with the properties we have inferred, as well as with other observations of XTE J1810-197. We conclude that this magnetar is the prototype for a new class of objects, a radio-emitting magnetar with a wide-spread surrounding structure. We estimate that 10\u201320% of magnetars may have such a structure, and that this could be a major contribution to the non-thermal radio emission from our Galaxy."}
{"text":"\nWe present a comprehensive study of the sensitivity of massive star nucleosynthesis and evolution to solar abundances and to uncertainties in helium burning reaction rates. We consider the impact of these parameters on the evolution of a 16 solar mass ONeMgWD with an initial composition corresponding to the solar one. We find that despite the rather small perturbation induced by the change of one single element, the stellar evolution is very sensitive to the change of the chemical composition. In particular, we show that the time of onset of helium burning and the associated evolution of the chemical composition has a large impact on the properties of the resulting WD. We also discuss the impact of uncertain helium burning reaction rates on the chemical composition of the massive star. We find that these uncertainties may have a large impact on the evolution of massive stars if the error is large enough. We also show that even a small error in the helium burning reaction rates may have a non-negligible impact on the resulting chemical composition of the WD and may thus produce a large number of peculiar WDs. Finally, we briefly discuss the implication of our results for the understanding of the massive star evolution."}

{"text":"\n\nWe present the results of the first direct measurement of the diameter of a star filling its Roche lobe, the semi-detached binary SS Leporis. We used the Very Long Baseline Interferometry technique with the VINCI instrument on the VLT, resolving the binary and obtaining a measure of the orbital separation and the projected separation between the two stars. We found that the stars are approximately 1.5 times the diameter of the Sun, which implies that the orbital separation is at most 8 solar radii. The observed orbital period is 55.4 minutes, which is slightly longer than the orbital period obtained from a previous spectroscopic study, but in very good agreement with the period predicted by theory for a system with the properties of SS Leporis. We find that the observed orbital elements are in very good agreement with the predictions of theory, and we can therefore use this system as a benchmark to test the validity of the assumptions made in the theory of stellar Roche lobe overflow."}
{"text":"\n\nWe have developed a new method for percutaneous renal access, using virtual projection of the ultrasound puncture tract onto fluoroscopic images. In order to obtain the projection, the ultrasound image and the fluoroscopic image are simultaneously displayed, allowing the puncture to be performed on the basis of the fusion image. In this study, the puncture tracts were projected onto the fluoroscopic images in three different ways. The first method used a simple linear transformation, whereas the other two methods used a more sophisticated transformation that allowed the tract to be curved. To evaluate the accuracy of the projection, a phantom study was performed in which the distance between the tip of a wire inserted into the phantom and its projected image on the fluoroscopic image was measured. The results showed that the projection of the puncture tract was very useful for obtaining the correct puncture site, and that the two curved transformation methods gave better results than the linear method."}

The longitudinal polarization of decays involving a $B^0_d$ or $B^0_s$ meson is found to be consistent with no direct CP violation effects, while the $D^+ D^-$ and $D^+_s D^-_s$ pairs show clear signs of CP violation.

{"text":"\nWe present observations of the recurrent nova RS Ophiuchi from the May\u2013June 2006 outburst, which reveal a large number of multiply ionized metal atoms in the shocked matter around the star. We estimate the ionization rate to be of order unity, suggesting that a significant fraction of the shock energy is spent in ionizing the gas. The metal ionization structure is well described by a steady-state solution of the Boltzmann equation for a homogeneous and isotropic gas, with a small-scale structure that is consistent with local turbulence. The relative yields of different ion species as a function of ionization stage are well described by a simple model in which the gas is assumed to be composed of a few atomic species that are ionized in a specific order. We find that the ionization structure is not well described by a single, gradually accelerating shock, but rather requires at least two distinct shocks, with one front overtaking the other in a nonlinear fashion. The data are consistent with a model in which the faster shock has a much higher energy than the slower one, and most of the ionization takes place in the second shock. We discuss the implications of this finding for the acceleration of cosmic rays in shocks."}
{"text":"\n\nWe introduce a framework for the construction of quantum field theories withaxiomatic symmetry groups. The framework is motivated by the idea ofgiving a rigorous meaning to the intuitive idea of a \"symmetry generator\" inconformal field theory. We show that this framework can be used to construct infinitely manynew quantum field theories, and that these field theories have certain surprisingand unusual properties. For example, the new theories are (partially)K-theoretic in a very strong sense, and the properties of theirpartition functions are very closely related to properties of certain partitionfunctions in number theory. We also construct a new type of quantum fieldtheory which has an algebraic K-theory which is (quasi)crystalline in asemi-simple type. This construction suggests the possibility ofrying to construct new types of quantum field theory with interesting andnon-trivial properties, by using the technique of constructingsemi-simple types with a certain type of branextension. Finally, we show that certain type of ToyModel can be constructed by using the framework, and that this ToyModel has certain non-trivial and interesting properties."}
{"text":"\nWe have performed a systematic study of the evolution of the spin correlation function in the n-type high-$T_c$ superconductor CeCoIn_5 at low temperatures, in the weak-to-non-correlated regime, using neutron-scattering techniques. We find that the single-particle spectral function at theCo-based Fermi surface is shredded into a large number of multiply-degenerate, commensurate quantum states. The nature of this structure is consistent with a crossover from a regular, higher-dimensional, periodic spectrum to a coarsely-faceted, lower-dimensional, non-periodic spectrum. We show this by performing a mathematical analysis of the recent theory of dresser pockets. The results explain why the pairing correlation function in this material does not follow the universal behavior predicted by the Dresselhaus-Dresse-Wohlfarth theory, but instead shows a strong preference for in-plane correlations. We also show that this breakdown of fermiology has a strong impact on the effective two-spinon correlation function, in a way which is consistent with the large number of low-spin states produced by the Megan mechanism. Our results suggest that the breakdown of the periodic structure of the spectral function is a generic feature of cuprate-based superconductors, and may be a signature of the onset of a low-spin state."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a new method for constructing summarizes of multiple sequence alignments that is based on successive sub-groupings of the aligned sequences. We show that our method is broadly applicable to many of the summarization methods that have been proposed in the literature. Our method has several advantages over existing methods. First, our method is guaranteed to produce a summary that is consistent with the multiple alignment when it is applied to any set of multiple alignment summaries that are themselves consistent. Second, our method is simple and efficient, being an entirely deterministic process of simpleminded filtering and clustering. Third, our method is general and can be applied to a variety of alignment summary methods, while previous methods have typically been specific to a single summary method. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a standard benchmark set of proteins, and show that it produces summaries that are more highly consistent with the multiple alignment than do previous methods."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present an overview of our current understanding of the structure and dynamics of the Sun's open magnetic field, based on observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), STEREO, SOHO, and other solar observatories. We describe how the structure and dynamics of the open field differs from that of the Sun's closed field, and how the two fields are linked through the solar wind. We discuss how the open field is generated by the evolution of the Sun's convection, the process of flux emergence, and the growth of magnetic regions on the Sun's surface. We then describe how the open field is structured, including the large-scale organization of the field, the location of the magnetic nulls, and the distribution of field strength and direction. We then discuss the dynamics of the open field, including the generation of solar wind, the evolution of the field with time, and the effects of the open field on the Sun's atmosphere. We conclude by discussing the structure and dynamics of the open field as a function of solar cycle phase, and by discussing the structure and dynamics of the field in the polar regions."}
{"text":"\nWe propose that the earliest stage of the Universe, before the cosmological constant became dominant, is described by loop quantum cosmology (LQC). We show that a version of LQC with a variable cosmological constant can be exactly solved, and this solution describes a Universe with a small cosmological constant that gradually increases over time. In this model, the transition from a small to a large cosmological constant is smooth, and the Universe is always described by a quantum theory. Therefore, there are no physical parameters that need to be fine-tuned for this model. We also show that the early Universe can be described by the same LQC model with a small cosmological constant, if the initial conditions are chosen appropriately.\n\nWe consider the question of whether there are physical consequences of including a cosmological constant in the early Universe that is small but not exactly zero.

{"text":"\n\nWe consider the evolution of the Stokes vector in a weakly anisotropic inhomogeneous medium. The evolution is determined by a system of differential equations with constant coefficients. The basic assumption is that the medium is locally isotropic, with local symmetry broken only by a step-like anisotropy coefficient. The evolution equations are solved analytically in the limit of a small anisotropy coefficient. We find that the solution includes two families of propagating waves, one of which corresponds to the elementary waves of the unbroken symmetry of the medium. We show that the other family of propagating waves is due to a violation of the conservation of the stress-energy tensor, which is associated with a certain distribution of singularities in the bulk of the medium. We analyze the physical implications of our results, and in particular we show that the evolution of the Stokes vector in a weakly anisotropic medium is well described by a sum of a curl-free and a twist-free wave."}
{"text":"\nWe study the inefficiency of the first-order Fermi process in the production of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECR) at relativistic shocks. We find that the inefficiency is significant for gas-type shocks and it can be as large as 50% for relatively strong shocks with $E_0 \\sim 50$ TeV. For weak shocks the inefficiency is small and it can be ignored. We show that the inefficiency is due to a small probability of triggering the first-order Fermi process during the collision of the shocked matter with the rest of the gas. We derive an analytic expression for the probability and we show that the inefficiency can be probed by measuring theUHECR energy spectrum at the shock. We discuss several methods for measuring the spectrum and we show that in all cases the inefficiency is observed as a suppression of the flux at small energies. We also quantify the theoretical uncertainty on the inefficiency and we find that it is small provided that the bulk velocity of the shocked gas is known with an accuracy of a few percent. For a given shock, the inefficiency is not very sensitive to the UHECR energy threshold used to define the energy bins in the spectrum. We also show that the inefficiency is insensitive to the detailed structure of the shock and it is mostly due to the bulk effect."}
{"text":"\nWe present a theory of magnetic turbulence production due to streaming cosmic rays (CRs) upstream of supernova remnant (SNR) shocks. The theory accounts for magnetic flux conservation and is applicable to both stationary and moving SNR shocks. We solve the theory analytically for the simple case of a stationary SNR shock and validate it against numerical solutions for both stationary and moving shocks. We find that the production rate of magnetic turbulence depends on the strength of the SNR shock, the CR streaming velocity, and the magnetic diffusivity of the interstellar medium. The magnetic turbulence production rate is found to be several orders of magnitude larger than the kinetic energy dissipation rate in the SNR shock, suggesting that it may be a significant source of energy for the magnetic turbulence in the interstellar medium. We also find that the size of the magnetic eddies generated is small compared to the size of the SNR shock, and it decreases with the distance from the shock, suggesting that the SNR shock is a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) scale phenomenon while the magnetic turbulence generated is a Kolmogorov scale phenomenon."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider the SL(2,R) WZNW model with Coulomb interactions. We evaluate the model by using the perturbative technique. We discuss the possibility of a non-perturbative approach and present results on the zero-coupling limit. \n\nThe motivation for this work is the study of the non-Abelian SL(2,R) WZNW model with non-trivial Z-action. We consider the simplest case of a one-dimensional model with the simplest non-Abelian Z-action, that is, the so-called Z3-action. In our model the Z3-action is generated by the standard Z3-rotation together with the so-called Z3-my Angle  forming a couplet under the SL(2,R) group.

For the SL(2,R) WZNW model with Coulomb interactions, the bound state solutions can be obtained by using the perturbative technique, that is, by using the standard Bethe vectors and the inverse scattering matrix technique.

{"text":"\nWe present observations of SN 2005hj, a nearby, bright, and well-observed Type Ia supernova. The light curve is well described by a sum of two exponential curves with a superimposed tail. The best-fit parameters are a peak absolute magnitude of -15.07 mag, a total light-emission duration of ~140 d, and a supernova (SN) mass of 1.3 \u00a0M\u2299. These properties are consistent with those of a normal-bright SN Ia. Our analysis indicates that the radiative tail, which contributes >10% to the total light budget, has a power law index of -0.9 and a duration of 70 d. We show that this radiative tail has a nearly constant decay rate, which implies that the temperature of the accretion disk is constant during the entire course of the explosion. We argue that this is inconsistent with the commonly held assumption that the accretion disk is fed with material from the rotating shell of the pre-explosion evolved star. We suggest that this disk is fed with material from the inner circumstellar layer, and that the inner layer is heated by radioactive decay and not by the accretion torque. This suggests that the mechanism of explosion in SNe of this class is different from that of the majority of normal-bright SNe. We discuss the implications of this difference for the mechanism of accretion, the understanding of radiative transfer, and the use of SNe as standard candles. We show that the combined light curve of SN 2005hj is consistent with the recent theoretical predictions of Miao et al. (2004), but our analysis suggests that their model needs to be modified. Finally, we argue that the observed properties of SN 2005hj are consistent with a single-zone structure for the accretion disk, and we show that a two-zone structure leads to a worse fit to the data."}
{"text":"\nWe present a Monte Carlo simulation study of the dynamic response of Ag adsorbates on Au(100) to an oscillatory variation of the chemical potential. We find that the distribution of the adsorbates is affected in a manner that depends on the magnitude of the amplitude of the chemical potential variation as well as on the frequency with which it is varied. Our results show that the distribution of the adsorbates becomes more uniform as the amplitude is increased, but that the standard deviation of the distribution increases as the frequency is increased. We also find that the dynamic response is affected by the history of the variation of the chemical potential, with the distribution of the adsorbates becoming more uniform if the variation is started from a state in which the adsorbates are highly ordered, and becoming more disordered if the variation is started from a state in which the adsorbates are highly disordered. We discuss our results in the framework of a simple model in which the adsorbates are treated as hard disks that can rotate in response to an external torque."}
{"text":"\nWe study damage propagation at the localization-delocalization transition of the confined Ising model. We consider a quasistatic evolution of a crack in a one-dimensional Ising model, in the limit of a strong confining potential, at the transition between the disordered and ordered phases. In a previous work, we showed that the critical damage amplitude for crack localization is related to the transition temperature in a universal way. Here we study the effect of anisotropic exchange interactions on this transition. We find that the transition temperature is increased in the direction perpendicular to the easy magnetization direction. We also show that the increase of the transition temperature is related to the stiffness of the elastic substrate in the same way as the transition temperature is related to the stiffness in the ordered phase. This implies that the critical damage amplitude for crack localization is also increased in the direction perpendicular to the easy magnetization direction. Our results are consistent with the anisotropic localization of damage, which is induced by the anisotropic exchange interactions."}
{"text":"\nWe present a new method for generating weak dynamical heterogeneities in idealized simulated water. We observe the breakdown of the Stokes-Einstein and Stokes-Einstein-Debye relations in our system, and show that this breakdown is due to the presence of these dynamical heterogeneities. Our method consists of adding a small Gaussian noise to the position of the particle every time it is moved according to the viscous equation of motion. The noise is small in comparison to the mean-square displacement, and has a variance that is small in comparison to the viscosity. Therefore, this noise does not change the mean-flow velocity or the mean-square displacement, but does change the instantaneous velocity and the instantaneous displacement. Our results show that the instantaneous displacement grows proportional to the viscosity, while the instantaneous velocity grows superlinearly. We show that this deviation from the Stokes-Einstein-Debye relations can be explained by a simple model in which the viscosity is related to the displacement and the instantaneous velocity is related to the mean-square displacement."}
{"text":"\n\nNetwork tomography based on 1-D projections\n------------------------------------------\n\nA reliable and efficient estimation of the underlying connectivity structure of a network is a long-standing problem in network science. We present a new algorithm for estimating the connectivity of a general directed network, based on computing a 1-D projection of the network. Our algorithm is simple and fast, with a linear complexity in the number of nodes. The proposed method has several attractive properties. In particular, it is shown that the proposed algorithm is reliable in the sense that the error in the estimated connectivity structure is upper-bounded from above, as the number of samples goes to infinity. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm is shown to be relatively insensitive to the choice of the projection direction, in the sense that the choice of the projection direction has only a second order impact on the obtained connectivity estimate. The proposed method is evaluated and compared to other network tomography methods using both simulated and real-world network data sets."}
{"text":"\nWe have developed a new algorithm based on the fibromyalgia model for searching the large scale structure (LSS) of the Universe. This algorithm uses the distribution of galaxies in a volume to extract the underlying LSS. Our analysis shows that the current LSS can be well described by a superposition of the fibromyalgia model and a model with a small scale power law, in a manner consistent with the standard model of cosmology. This provides a good indication that the LSS is stable against the evolution of the Universe. However, there exist local fluctuations that cannot be described by these two models, which corresponds to the existence of a significant amount of dark matter (DM) in these regions. We show that these local DM peaks are correlated with the large scale structure, and in particular with the locations of the superclusters. Our results suggest that the local DM distribution is very well described by a model in which large scale structures are formed by the aggregation of DM halos, while small scale structure is generated by the violent relaxation of the DM particles inside the DM halos. We show that this model is consistent with the observation of large scale structure in the Universe, and in particular with the latest data from the WMAP and Planck missions."}
{"text":"\n\nWe investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics of a general class of quantum impurities whose symmetry is broken by an external drive. We show that such systems exhibit rich non-equilibrium physics, including non-Equilibrium Phase Transitions (NEPTs), nonequilibrium criticality, and memory-like dynamics, which can be understood by studying the relation between the rate of entropy production and the information theory developed for these systems. In particular, we show that the excess of entropy production over the equilibrium value is related to the violation of the Second Law of Thermodynamics for a general class of quantum systems, and that it is equal to the information produced by an observer performing a nonequilibrium measurement on the system. We also show that an analogue of the Jarzynski equality holds for nonequilibrium systems, relating the rate of entropy production to the probability distribution of the states visited by the system. We discuss the relation between our results and the recently introduced concept of Griffiths phases, and the role of the detection process in the interpretation of nonequilibrium information."}
{"text":"\nWe present an analysis of temporal and azimuthal variability in the Io plasma torus observed by the Cassini UVIS instrument during the T18 flyby on December 31, 2010. We use a simple model in which the torus is treated as a plane layer of a constant density and we perform a temporal Fourier analysis of both the observed density distribution and the relative torus width. We find that the observed density distribution is well described by a sum of a DC term, a low-frequency ( ~ 1 day) sine wave, and a high-frequency ( ~ 6 hours) sine wave. We show that these two sine waves are related to the first and second harmonics of the orbital period of Io. In contrast, the torus width is not well described by any simple model, but we show that this is likely due to the projection effect. We discuss a number of possible physical causes of these non-negligible temporal and azimuthal variations in the Io plasma torus, including the intrinsic variability of the ionospheric plasma and the effects of the traveling torus on the surrounding plasma. We show that these causes are not mutually exclusive and that a combination of several physical processes can explain the observations."}

{"text":"\n\nWe present a unification of the Pythagorean theorem for electronic orbitals with Kepler's law for planetary orbits. The motivation for our research is the observation that the Coulomb interaction between two point charges in the presence of a third, time-varying point charge displays features that are reminiscent of the action of a central force on a conic section, with the interesting difference that the emphasis is on the dynamically changing structure of the resulting orbitals. We show that this analogy can be made precise by replacing the Coulomb interaction with a centripetal force, and that the resulting orbits can be related to the Pythagorean theorem. The problem that our work attempts to solve is to understand the geometric structure of electron orbitals in terms of the basic tools of geometry, namely, the conic sections. Our results obtained are that electron orbitals can be unified with the Pythagorean theorem, and the resulting orbits can be related to Kepler's laws for the motion of planets. The practical applications of our findings are that the geometric structure of electron orbitals can be used to understand the structure of atoms and molecules, and the resulting orbits can be used to understand the dynamics of planetary systems. The theoretical implications for future research are that the Pythagorean theorem may be used to understand the structure of electron orbitals, and that the resulting orbits can be related to the dynamics of planetary systems."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a method for simultaneously determining the age, metallicity and alpha-element abundance of a single stellar population using the ultraviolet (UV) and optical photometry of a large sample of stars in globular clusters. We show that the method is not sensitive to the detailed structure of the clusters, and that it is thus applicable to clusters with complex dynamical histories, including blends. We apply the method to a sample of more than 250 clusters with a wide range of metallicities, and find that the age and alpha-element abundance of a cluster are correlated in a way that depends on the cluster's metallicicity. We show that this correlation can be reproduced with a model in which the clusters are formed by the collapse of gas clouds that are polluted by alpha-rich gas that is recycled from the inner galactic disc. The age and alpha-element abundance of a cluster are set by the properties of the gas cloud at the time of collapse, while the metallicicity is increased as the cloud evolves and entrains gas from the inner disc. We show that the observed correlation can be used to determine the relative contribution of alpha-rich gas to the cluster formation history, and that this contribution is large for clusters with low metallicities, and small for clusters with high metallicities. We discuss this result in the context of models for the chemical evolution of the galactic disc, and find that it is consistent with the idea that the clusters are formed by the collapse of gas clouds that are polluted by alpha-rich gas that is recycled from the inner galactic disc."}

{"text":"\n\nWe have performed a systematic study of the effect of the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) on the insulating state of Ca3CoRhO6. We found that the break down of the insulating state, in general, is induced by the existence of a non-trivial symmetry of the spin-orbital ordered state, and is always accompanied by a phase transition to a non-centrosymmetric state. In particular, we found a new type of charge ordering, which we call the spin-orbital charge ordering, for the first time in a real material. The spin-orbital charge ordering is very robust against the deformation of the crystal lattice, and does not change its nature by the breaking of the rotational symmetry, while the conventional charge ordering is sensitive to the lattice symmetry. We also found that the insulating state can be recovered by a field-induced symmetry breaking of the non-centrosymmetric state, and the recovered insulating state is different from the original one. Our results suggest that the spin-orbital coupling plays an essential role in the realization of the insulating state in a real material."}

We find that the ratio of the primary to the secondary cosmic rays is higher than 10, which is consistent with the assumption that the primary cosmic rays are directly produced from the primordial gas and the secondary rays are produced through the interaction of the primary rays with the gas. We also obtain that the mean free path of the cosmic rays is very large, which is consistent with the assumption that the gas is nearly collisionless. We discuss our results in the framework of a simple model of the evolution of the primordial gas."}
{"text":"\nWe present new radio timing observations of the isolated neutron star RX J1856.5-3754. We find that the system is best described by a Lorentzian orbit with a 6.6 day period, in disagreement with previous suggestions of a longer period. This 6.6 day period is nearly identical to that of the well-studied low-mass X-ray binary 4U0142-69, for which we present a detailed comparison. We find no evidence of any long-term timing variations, but we do observe a secular trend in the data which may be due to small-scale timing variations on timescales of years. We present a formalism which can be used to extract the contribution of such variations to the measured time derivative of the orbital elements. Our best-fit model requires that the accretion disc be eccentric, which is inconsistent with the assumption of a circular orbit, and we discuss possible geometries which could give rise to this. We also present observations of the X-ray and radio brightnesses as a function of orbital phase, which together with the timing observations, constrain the geometry of the accretion disc. We conclude that the disc is unlikely to be in a bipolar geometry, and we discuss the implications of this for the stability of the system."}
{"text":"\nWe present a formalism that allows to compute the difference between the number of neutral B mesons in a hadron final state and the number expected from a random hadronization process. The motivation for this work is the fact that the mean lifetime of a neutral B meson is much larger than the lifetime of a hadron. Thus, if the hadronization process is not sufficiently fast, a significant fraction of B mesons will have a lifetime larger than the hadronization time, and therefore will be removed from the final state. We show that the difference between the number of B mesons in the final state and the number expected from a random hadronization process is proportional to the square of the mean lifetime of the B mesons. This formalism can be used to study the lifetime of B mesons in different systems, such as the large neutrino detectors where they can be produced in hadron collisions at the hadronization edges, and the very forward directed hadron collisions where they can be produced in the initial hard part of the collision and live long enough to be detected in the final state."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present an algorithm for the rapid detection of planetary transits which is based on the use of wavelets. Our method, TRUFAS (Wavelet Transits), uses the fact that the silhouette of a planet against its host star is a pulse-like function which can be well approximated by a wavelet basis. We show that by using the appropriate scaling parameters the precision of the transit time can be significantly improved over a naive analysis. In particular we show that by using a parameter which corresponds to the characteristic time scale of the transit it is possible to achieve a timing precision which is close to the accuracy limit set by the sampling theorem. We present an analysis of the dependence of our method on the choice of basis function as well as the influence of the choice of scaling parameters. We show that for the particular case of detecting transits in grazing eclipses our method is equivalent to a least-squares fit of the data to a linear function. We present a simulation study which investigates the effect of various realistic noise sources on the precision of the transit time as well as the detectability of the transit. We apply our method to real data obtained from the NASA\/ESA Hubble Space Telescope and the ground based Automated Planet Finder and show that in both cases a significant improvement in the transit time precision is obtained.\n\nWe describe the motivation for our work and the key ideas and methodology used.

{"text":"\n\nWe show the existence of almost-free finite covers of any locally compact second countable Noetherian module over a ring $R$, providing a positive answer to a question posed by S.aminsack.\n\nThe motivation for the research is the connection between the concept of a free module and the theory of Artin-Tits groups in the case of semi simple rings. If $R$ is a semi simple ring, a theorem of Auslander-Reiten describes the structure of injective modules over $R$ in terms of the Artin-Tits group of $R$ and the irreducible representations of the symmetric group. In particular, Auslander-Reiten showed that any injective module over a semi simple ring $R$ is a direct sum of irreducible representations of the symmetric group and that any injective module over a non-simple ring $R$ is a free module. We show that if $R$ is not semi simple, there exist injective modules which are not free.\n\nThe key ideas and methodology are the following. Let $M$ be a locally compact second countable Noetherian module over a ring $R$. We prove that there is an injective module $N$ with $N \\cong M \\otimes R$ and with $\\operatorname{Hom}_R(N, R) = 0$. The module $N$ is clearly locally compact second countable, and therefore it suffices to show that it is injective. We then show that $N$ is injective by describing a bounded linear functional on $N$ which does not become zero. The argument uses the following general fact about the injectivity of modules over rings: if $R$ is a ring with a multiplicative identity, and $M$ is a module over $R$, then $M$ is injective if and only if $\\operatorname{Hom}_R(M, R)$ is injective.\n\nWe show that if $R$ is a ring with a multiplicative identity, and $M$ is a module over $R$ with $\\operatorname{Hom}_R(M, R) = 0$, then $M$ is injective if and only if $M$ is divisible.\n\nFinally, we show that if $R$ is a non-semi simple ring, there exist modules $M$ with $\\operatorname{Hom}_R(M, R) = 0$ and $M$ is not divisible."}

{"text":"\n\nWe study the structure of gauge theories with broken flavor symmetry and the possibility of their unification with the Standard Model. We find that the simplest such theory with a manifest breaking of the flavor symmetry is the unitary theory with two generations of identical quarks and two generations of identical charged leptons, in which the only flavor-breaking interaction is the Yukawa coupling to the Z- gauge boson. This theory has the same number of generations as the Standard Model and, therefore, unifications of this theory with the SM are rather straightforward. We show that such a unified theory can be obtained by the simple expedient of a non-Abelian Z-group structure, which leads to an effective Nambu-Goldstone boson and to a non-standard Higgs sector. The physical quarks and charged leptons remain completely massless, except for the lightest quark and the lightest charged lepton which acquire small effective masses. Therefore, this theory does not have a \"ataka-like\" structure. We also show that the Standard Model can be obtained as a limit of this theory, by setting the non-Abelian parameter to zero. The possibility of a \"gitlab-like\" structure is also discussed."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate a dynamic critical behavior of Ising meanfield dynamics on a spatial tricritical point of a broad class of IBM models in a thermodynamic limit. We show analytically and numerically that the system may have different types of phase boundaries in a dynamic critical regime: tricritical point separating three different phases, as well as ictal and tuck-in boundaries, separating a dynamic critical phase from a non-critical one. The dynamic critical behavior of the Ising meanfield dynamics on the tricritical point is influenced by an external driving, in the same way as the corresponding static critical behavior. We find that an external oscillatory driving of a special form can enhance the probability of being in the dynamic critical state with three different phases, as well as in the ictal state, and can thus drive the system to the corresponding phase boundaries. Our results suggest that the dynamic critical behavior in general may be controlled by an external driving in a similar way as the static critical behavior."}
{"text":"\n\nLong-range interactions in systems of driven particles are known to give rise to rich nonlinear dynamics, such as sync \", but can also lead to other interesting phenomena, such as the onset of quasi-periodic motion, that have not been extensively studied. In this paper, we consider driven systems with long-range interactions from the quasilinear theory. We find that general kinetic equations can be derived for these systems that describe the evolution of the internal degrees of freedom of the particles. We show that these equations can give rise to quasi-periodic motions and investigate the form of the corresponding orbits. We find that these orbits are generally unstable against small perturbations, but that they can be made stable by a small change in the microscopic dynamics. We discuss the physical implications of this result and consider the special case of Imperialist Invasions, a simple model of collaborative dynamics with long-range interactions, that is known to exhibit quasi-periodic motion."}

We describe a simple model that is suitable for MMOGs, and show that it can be used to study the effects of individual behavior on the spread of an infectious disease. Our results suggest that a realistic synthetic population model can reproduce the key features of an epidemic, including the basic reproductive number and the distribution of susceptible and infected individuals. We also find that the synthetic population model can be used to study the effects of individual behavior on the spread of the disease, and that the model can be used to design interventions that can be used to control the epidemic."}
{"text":"\n\nThe magnetic fields of large Virgo Cluster spirals\nThe large spiral galaxies of the Virgo Cluster, such as M87 and M49, have strong magnetic fields that are important in shaping their evolution. We present a catalogue of magnetic field measurements for 47 spiral galaxies in the Virgo Cluster, based on Faraday Rotation Measure (RMs) and polarized radio data. The average RM in this sample is 13.4 \u00b1 1.1 kpcs, and the magnetic field strengths are large enough to be comparable to the interstellar medium fields in our own Galaxy. We find that the fields are strongly ordered, and that they are mainly perpendicular to the preferred face of the galaxies. The field orientation is stable on galactic scales, but there is large-scale ordered field reconfiguration in some galaxies, which may be related to field lines getting caught up in the strong winds from the centres of these galaxies. We show that the magnitudes of the field strengths are well described by a power law distribution with an exponential cut-off, providing a simple model for the distribution of field strengths in these galaxies. The field strengths are positively correlated with the galaxy stellar mass, but are inversely correlated with the galaxy's radius. We discuss the implications of these results for the role of magnetic fields in the structure and evolution of galaxies, and for the mechanisms of field generation and amplification."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present observations of HD217860, a star suspected to be an A-type binary with a relatively long orbital period, and find it to be the first multiperiodic Delta Scuti star discovered. We have observed two non-synchronous pulsation modes with frequencies of 7.15 and 6.25 min, corresponding to orbital periods of approximately 8.5 and 10.0 hours, respectively. Thus, the system is a member of a new class of hybrid binary- triples which contain three gravitationally coupled bodies: a small, dense object, a mid-size object, and a large, low-mass object. The primary, a young B-type star, fills the role of the small object, a giant planet or a low-mass star fills the role of the mid-size object, and a tiny, high-mass object (a brown dwarf or a giant planet) fills the role of the large object. We estimate the orbital elements of the inner binary and find that both the primary and its companion are very low-mass stars or brown dwarfs. The companion is slightly more massive than the primary. We discuss the mechanism of formation of such a hybrid system."}
{"text":"\n\nIntroduction\nIn the field of statistics, variable selection is an important problem that has been studied extensively. In many applications, the number of variables is large and the observations are limited. In this case, it is difficult to estimate the coefficients of all variables and the model with the minimum number of variables that can explain the observations is desired. In other words, the coefficient vector that minimizes the loss function is sought. The lasso method is a famous algorithm for variable selection. The lasso method is an iterative algorithm that includes two steps: the solution of the normal equations and the determination of the least absolute shrinkage threshold (or the Tau threshold). The Tau threshold is determined by calculating the minimum value of the absolute value of the sum of the coefficients of the variables to be selected (Tau value). The process is repeated until all the variables with a coefficient absolute value greater than the Tau value are selected. The lasso method has a high execution time because the solution of the normal equations is an iteration that depends on the number of variables. In this work, we propose a new method for variable selection based on the lasso method that reduces the execution time. Our method incorporates prior constraint information into the lasso method. We performed experiments on simulated and real data sets, and compared the results with those obtained by the lasso method to show the effectiveness of our method."}
{"text":"\nWe present observations of the radio source 2MASS J2126, which is thought to be a low-mass X-ray binary containing a young, spinning neutron star with a relatively long spin-down lifetime. The source has been known for over two decades, but its nature has been controversial. We have observed 2MASS J2126 in outburst, in quiescence, and in a state of orbital decay. Our observations reconcile the apparently conflicting observations of other groups, and we show that the accretion disc is highly asymmetric, with a strong retrograde component. We estimate the accretion rate to be  \u223c 10^( \u2212 9) M_(\u2299) yr^( \u2212 1), which is not only several orders of magnitude less than the accretion rate in the last few thousand years, but is also smaller than the accretion rate needed to explain the observed spin-down of the neutron star. We suggest that the main accretion event occurred in the distant past, and that the accretion disc has been349uttering due to the complicated orbital dynamics caused by the neutron star's asymmetric spin. We show that 2MASS J2126 is the low-mass X-ray binary counterpart of the supernova SN1987A, which would make it the first known object in which a white dwarf and a neutron star co-exist."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present observations of the 13CO J=3-2 line in the region of the Arcminute Microkelvin Imager (AMI) survey. The observations were made with the aim of detecting and characterising low-mass stars and possible massive Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) in the high-mass star-forming region of the southern hemisphere. We have detected ten candidate massive YSOs with masses in the range 1.5 to 4.7 solar masses. We have estimated the mass of these objects by comparison with the well-studied massive YSOs in the Orion region, and find that our candidates have masses in the same range.

The scatter is larger than the intrinsic scatter of the relation, and we discuss a number of possible physical mechanisms which might give rise to this.

{"text":"\n\nTemporal Runtime Verification using Monadic Difference Logic\n\nWe consider the problem of runtime verification of temporal properties of finite-state systems. Let us denote the set of states of a system as S, and let us denote the set of detected states as D. A run of a system is a sequence of states from S to D, obtained by repeatedly applying the system's transitions. Let us denote the set of runs of a system as R. The goal of runtime verification is to check whether a given temporal property, expressed using a temporal logic formula, is satisfied by all runs in R, or, more generally, by some subset of runs in R. We present a technique for such runtime verification, which is based on computing the difference of monadic second-order logic specifications, and on checking the satisfaction of the resulting formula using a tableau algorithm. Our technique is applicable to a large class of temporal properties, and has the advantage of not requiring any preprocessing of the system's state space. As an application, we consider the case where the system is an ensemble of PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers), and the temporal property is a safety property."}
{"text":"\n\nWe have developed a new technique to study the conformational changes of single macromolecules in solution by measuring the changes in the fluorescence polarization of a covalently attached fluorescent dye.

We have studied the effect of the solution viscosity on the conformational dynamics of a single DNA molecule by attaching a fluorescent dye to a short segment of DNA. We found that the mobility of the DNA molecule is reduced as the viscosity of the solution increases, and that this change is accompanied by a decrease of the fluorescence anisotropy, without any significant change of the fluorescence intensity. We discuss our results in the framework of a simple model, which describes the anisotropic movement of the single molecule in a viscous solution. Our results suggest that the viscosity of the solution has a direct effect on the conformational dynamics of single macromolecules, even if these macromolecules are not able to change their shape in a significant way."}

{"text":"\n\nWe study the modification of quantum walks by a class of finite depth regret functions. These are related to symmetric feedback maps that have a certain minimum statistical depth.

In the process, we give a simple derivation of the relationships between the standard deviation and the depth for a general quantum walk. We show that the standard deviation of the position after n steps is equal to the depth multiplied by the standard deviation after one step, provided that this depth is less than a certain threshold. We also derive a simple expression for the variance of the position after an even number of steps, in terms of the variance after one step and the depth.

{"text":"\nUnplugging the Universe: the neglected electromagnetic consequence of decoupling\n\nWe present a solution to the problem of the energy stored in the electromagnetic field surrounding a uniformly charged sphere as it is being moved through a medium with a non-zero resistivity.

This exact solution is then used to find the energy stored in the electromagnetic field surrounding a uniformly charged sphere as it is being moved through a medium with a non-zero resistivity. The solution to the problem is obtained by using a technique called the method of images. The solution is exact, and it is independent of the size of the sphere, the radius of the sphere, and the resistivity of the medium. The solution also shows that the energy stored in the electromagnetic field surrounding a uniformly charged sphere as it is being moved through a medium with a non-zero resistivity is equal to the energy stored in the electromagnetic field surrounding a point charge as it is being moved through a medium with a non-zero resistivity."}
{"text":"\nWe have recently developed a new approach to studying the complex dynamics of signal transduction pathways in single cells.

We show that the relative contribution of each node in the signaling network to the overall personalized signaling in a cell depends on the specific combination of nodes that are active in that cell. We have developed a method for detecting small changes in personalized signaling in response to perturbations, and we show that these changes are highly informative about the effect of the perturbation on the dynamics of the signaling network. We have applied our approach to the analysis of the early response to ionizing radiation, a key regulator of apoptosis, and have identified two separate sub-populations of cells with distinct personal signaling profiles. Further analysis showed that cells with one of these personal signaling profiles are more likely to undergo apoptosis in response to ionizing radiation than cells with the other personal signaling profile, indicating that personalized signaling may be a general mechanism for selective control of cell fate decisions in heterogeneous cell populations."}
{"text":"\n\nChemotaxis is the ability of cells to move in response to external chemical stimuli. In bacterial chemotaxis, cells move towards attractants and away from repellents. We previously showed that the chemotactic behavior of Escherichia coli is governed by a sliding diffusion model with an adaptively controlled time constant, which allows the cells to distinguish between long-lasting and short-lasting chemical gradients. Here, we show that the variability of the cell's behavioral response increases with the steepness of the gradient. We found that the standard deviation of the chemotactic velocity increases with the magnitude of the attractant concentration, while the variance of the chemotactic velocity increases with the magnitude of the repellent concentration. The increase of the behavioral variability is likely due to the cells' ability to sense and avoid large Brownian motion, which becomes more important when the cells are moving in a steep gradient. Our results suggest that variability of a behavioral response can be adaptively controlled to optimize the chemotactic performance."}
{"text":"\n\nThe Supernova Channel of Super-AGB Stars\n\nWe present a detailed analysis of the close supernova (SN) companions of super-asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. We find that the properties of the SN companions are consistent with the SN evolution proceeding in two different channels, depending on the initial orbital period. The \"fast channel\" is characterized by relatively rapid orbital decay and large phase excursions, possibly resulting in the transfer of matter from the AGB star to the SN companion. We find that in the \"fast channel\" the mass transfer is more efficient when the orbital period is smaller, consistent with the SN companion being the first to evolve towards the red giant branch. The \"slow channel\" is characterized by much slower orbital decay and small phase excursions, with the SN companion remaining on the blue side of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. We show that the \"slow channel\" is compatible with the SN companion being a low-mass object, such as a white dwarf, a neutron star, or even a black hole. We also consider the effects of an initial large orbital period, and find that it results in a very efficient mass transfer, possibly to the point of removing most of the AGB star's matter. Our results suggest that a large portion of AGB stars might evolve towards low-mass objects, possibly even including black holes, through SN explosions."}

{"text":"\nWe have performed a systematic study of the evolution of the superconducting (SC) order parameter and critical magnetic field in PrOs$_4$Sb$_{12}$ by means of measurements of the specific heat. These were carried out on samples which had been ground to various degrees.

The nature of the two SC transitions in the specific heat is discussed in the framework of a simple model which takes into account the finite size of the particles and the formation of bound pairs. We show that the depression of the magnetic susceptibility has a different origin from the increase in the critical magnetic field for the magnetic-field-induced SC transition. We also found that the electrical resistivity shows a clear signature of the transition to the normal conducting state at the glass transition temperature."}

We have imaged with milliarcsecond resolution, by means of multi-frequency synthesis, a number of MYSOs in the \u1e9e\u22c5B \u223c 1.5\u20132.5 GHz frequency range. We find that in general the radio power from these sources is below the detection limit of our observations, in spite of the fact that some of these sources are known to be extremely luminous in the optical and near-infrared domains. We have derived a detection limit of \u1e9e\u22c5B \u223c 1027 W Hz-1  Mousis et al. (1995). This is slightly above the absolute magnitude of the brightest sources in our sample. We have derived an upper limit to the radio power of the brightest sources of \u1e9e\u22c5B \u223c 1028 W Hz-1, which represents  \u223c 10% of their optical power. The only two sources which have been detected are also the two brightest in our sample. We have compared our observations with simple models in which the radio source is treated as a  point source  within a uniform ionised gas cloud. In our best-fitting model, the ionised gas is not homogeneous, but has a temperature gradient, with the gas temperature increasing with distance from the source. We discuss this result in the framework of recent theoretical models."}
{"text":"\n\nWe revisit cosmological bounds on the radiative lifetime of neutrinos. Based on a thorough analysis of the relevant cosmological observations we find that the current best fit to the data, as obtained by state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, results in a radiative lifetime of 3.5% of the age of the Universe for active neutrinos and 2.7% for sterile neutrinos. These bounds are more than an order of magnitude larger than the radiative lifetime implied by the standard cosmological model. The main new result in this work is that we show that state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamical simulations are in agreement with the standard cosmological model only if the physical parameters of the model are modified in such a way as to reduce the radiative lifetime of neutrinos well below the value predicted by the standard cosmological model. The parameters we consider are the density of dark matter, the number of relativistic neutrinos and the corresponding ratio to non-relativistic neutrinos, and the mass of the active neutrinos. We find that for all the considered parameters the lower bound on the radiative lifetime of neutrinos is always smaller than the prediction of the standard cosmological model. We discuss the implications of our findings for the standard cosmological model and for the active and sterile neutrinos."}
{"text":"\n\nQuantum Noise in Differential-type Gravitational-wave Interferometer and Signal Recycling.\nWe propose a differential-type gravitational-wave (GW) interferometer with a signal recycling (SC) configuration for quantum-limited measurement of GWs. The differential-type GW interferometer can achieve a large conditional gain by using a mirror suspension with a very high stiffness and a large fraction of mirror displacement. In this paper, we evaluate the quantum noise in the interferometer due to thermal fluctuations in the mirrors and the SC configuration. We find that the quantum-limited detection sensitivity of the interferometer is significantly improved by the SC configuration. The quantum noise in the SC configuration is evaluated by considering the configuration as a continuous system and using the stochastic approach. The evaluation is confirmed by using the variational approach. We also discuss the effect of a mechanical suppression of the thermal noise by using a negative spring, which is shown to be significant when the spring constant is large."}
{"text":"\n\nRapid Diffusion of dipolar order enhances dynamic nuclear polarization\n\nThe rich and complex spectrum of dynamical nuclear polarizations has been barely explored so far, due to the rarity of experimental conditions under which nuclear spins can be driven far from equilibrium. Here we report a new method to enhance the dynamic nuclear polarization by means of a rapid diffusion of a dipolar order, which allows to reach a steady state with highly polarized nuclear spins far from equilibrium. Our method is based on the idea of using the energy from the dipolar interaction to accelerate the nuclear spins towards their equilibrium value, in a similar way as energy transfer from the kinetic energy of a solvent to the internal energy of a solute enables rapid equilibration of the solute. We show that the efficiency of this process is such that it can even lead to a slight overshoot of the equilibrium value in a finite time. Our theory also provides a good description of the singular behavior observed in a recent experiment where a liquid crystal was cooled down through its phase transition temperature, showing a jump of the nuclear spin density in the liquid phase, in excellent agreement with a simple kinetic model.\n\nOur results open a new route to enhance the dynamic nuclear polarization and to study the rich and complex dynamics of nuclear spins far from equilibrium. Our theory also provides a framework to study the effect of a rapid diffusion of the dipolar order on the equilibrium properties of matter, in a similar way as the OSE theory studies the effects of a rapid diffusion of the structure."}
{"text":"\n\nWe study the evolution of complex modular biological networks. We show that such networks display community structure, that is, groups of nodes that are more densely connected internally than with the rest of the network. We find that this community structure isscale-free, that is, the degree distribution of the nodes in each community follows a power law. We also find that the largest groups, that is, the groups with the largest number of nodes, are the most stable groups. The stability of these groups isGuarerd by the presence of a large number of links between the nodes within each group, and by the presence of only a small number of links between each group and the rest of the network. We also show that there are algorithms that can identify the communities in a complex modular network, and that these communities can be identified using only local information about the links, that is, without knowing the labels of the nodes. We discuss the implications of these results for the evolution of modularity, and for the identification of functional modules."}
{"text":"\nWe present new results for the measurement of the dark matter velocity anisotropy in galaxy clusters, based on the analysis of three clusters with measured galaxy positions in a half-sky survey with deep imaging, and two clusters in a shallower survey with medium-band imaging. We show that the data are consistent with the anisotropy being close to the precision-of-observations limit of $\\Delta\\Phi_{\\rm DM} \\sim 2\\times 10^{-4}$. The main systematics in the measurement are the cluster galaxy distribution and the measurement of the cluster center. We find that the distribution of galaxies in a cluster has a large impact on the measured anisotropy, and that a careful statistical analysis is required to obtain the correct uncertainty. We present the measured cluster anisotropy as a function of cluster richness, and find no evidence for a trend. We also present the anisotropy as a function of the observed over-density, and find that it is consistent with being constant. We find that a measurement of the cluster scale parameter $\\alpha$ is not necessary for a good measurement of the cluster anisotropy. We briefly discuss the implications of our results for the interpretation of cluster lensing data."}
{"text":"\nWe consider the possibility of a non-commutative brane inflation in string theory. The model we consider is inspired on the one recently proposed by Nicolisi and Riva for a commutative inflationary cosmology. In our case the dynamics is generated by a non-commutative inflaton field. We show that such a model is able to describe a slow and smooth evolution of the spatial slices as well as a fast-collapsing phase. The slow evolution is due to a linear evolution of the inflaton field, while the fast-collapsing phase is described by a quadratic form of the inflaton field. We analyze the physical conditions for the transition between the two different dynamics and show that in the relevant parameter space the transition is continuous. In addition we show that in this parameter space the slow evolution and the fast-collapsing phases are co-exclusive, i.e. they cannot describe the evolution of the spatial slices at the same time. In this sense our model is different from the one proposed by Nicolisi and Riva."}
{"text":"\n\nWe propose and demonstrate a novel approach to valley dependent optoelectronics based on symmetry breaking in a ferroelectric layer. We show that the broken symmetry can be used to generate a strong and fast optical response in an adjacent semiconductor layer, which can be used for various optoelectronic applications. Our approach is based on the realization that a symmetry breaking strain field in a ferroelectric layer can be efficiently and periodically mapped to a second material in a layered structure, in a similar way as the spontaneous polarization is mapped to the piezoelectric response in a ferroelectric-piezoelectric bilayer. We demonstrate a strong and fast photoresponse with a high on\/off ratio in a photodetector configuration, as well as efficient and fast carrier injection in a light emitting device configuration, both in a nanostructured semiconductor material. Our results open up new avenues for designing nanostructured optoelectronic devices with a strong and fast response, which can be easily integrated with Si technology."}
{"text":"\n\nWe propose a new type of continuum theory which is based on the assumptions that the material is homogeneous and isotropic, and that the body has a low dimension. As an application, we consider the problem of the stability of a nano-rod to elastic deformations. We show that the standard continuum theory, which is applicable to an infinite dimensional body, is not applicable to a body with a low dimension. Then, we propose a new theory which takes into account the fact that the degrees of freedom are limited. We show that, in this case, the constitutive law which is derived from the standard continuum theory is not anymore equivalent to the Newton's law of motion, and that a correction term has to be introduced. We show that this correction term has a simple physical meaning: it represents the elastic energy which is released when the deformation becomes too large. Then, we use this theory to study the stability of a nano-rod to bending and torsion. We show that the standard continuum theory is not able to describe the stability to bending of a rod with a low diameter, and that a correction term has to be introduced. We also show that the stability to torsion is influenced by the limited number of degrees of freedom."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present far-infrared spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of galaxies in the z~0.7 Universe, selected from the Halfway Galaxy survey, in order to investigate the evolution of the dust content of galaxies in the reionization era. We find a large diversity in the SEDs, with most galaxies showing a clear trend of increasing dust temperature with wavelength, but with several exceptions. The most notable result is a group of eight galaxies in which the dust temperature is below the value expected from an optically thick dust cloud at the given observed wavelength. We discuss several physical mechanisms that may be responsible for this effect, including the important role of AGN feedback. In addition, we find that the dust temperature trend is correlated with the stellar mass, but not with the gas mass, the star formation rate, or the redshift. We also find a correlation between the observed dust temperature and the dust mass, suggesting that the dust is more efficiently heated in massive galaxies. Our results are consistent with the idea that galaxies are able to preserve their dust content despite the harsh conditions of the reionization era, but at the same time they suggest that dust may be removed more efficiently in massive galaxies."}
{"text":"\nWe present observations of the young, massive stars in the Galactic globular cluster M3, the analysis of which provides strong evidence that these stars were accreted by the Galaxy in a single, giant gas grab. The accretionary origin of the cluster implies that its stars were born in a massive molecular cloud that was accreted by the then-youthful Galaxy, and that this accretion process was accompanied by a hot, massive gas component that was also accreted. The infall of this gas would have inflated the cluster to its present size, and driven its stars to high velocities. We show that these high velocities, which were previously interpreted as proof of the cluster's theft from a satellite cluster, can be explained by the accretionary infall of gas. The cluster's low metallicity is consistent with this accretionary origin, and its large radius is consistent with a massive accretionary wind. Our analysis indicates that the Galactic stellar halo was built up by the accretion of giant molecular clouds and their embedded clusters, and that these accretions occurred over a period of several billion years."}
{"text":"\n\nWe study the stability of circumnuclear disks in elliptical galaxies. We find that the gravitational instability of such disks is driven by the global structure of the host galaxy, and is not affected by the local properties of the disk itself. We show that the critical circum- disk density, above which the disk will be gravitationally unstable, is proportional to the square of the effective gravity at the disk's inner boundary. Our analysis reveals that the mass of the disk's inner boundary must be at least 5% of the host galaxy's total mass, in order for the disk to be gravitationally stable. We show that this condition is met only for disks with inner boundaries that are at least 1-2 effective radii away from the galaxy's center. We also find that the dynamical friction acting on the disk by the galactic potential can be as large as the viscous torque internal to the disk, and that it is this dynamical friction that eventually drives the disk to become unstable. Based on our analysis, we conclude that circumnuclear disks with inner boundaries located closer than about 1-2 effective radii to the center of the host galaxy are dynamically unstable, and will be unable to survive for significant lengths of time."}
{"text":"\n\nWe have developed a new algorithm to efficiently compute the phase-space density in a halo given its dark matter (DM) distribution. Our algorithm makes use of the idea that the phase-space density is related to the Cosmological Constant, which can be efficiently computed for a given halo. We demonstrate that this algorithm is several orders of magnitude faster than the previous method. This allows us to compute the phase-space density for halos with billion particles in reasonable time. With this new algorithm we have performed a statistical analysis of the evolution of the phase-space density in halos. We find that the distribution of the phase-space density is not homogenous, but has a strong dependence on the halo mass. In particular, we find that the mean phase-space density is constant for halos with mass M <= 10^36 kg, and then increases sharply for heavier halos. We also find that the variation of the phase-space density is not small, and that there exist subhalos within massive halos that have much lower phase-space density than the halo average. We discuss our results in the framework of recent ideas that the large scale structure of the Universe can be explained by the competition between the phase-space density and the gravity. We show that our results are consistent with a model where the growth of structure is mainly due to the increase of the phase-space density, and that the formation of massive halos is due to the competition between the phase-space density and the gravity."}
{"text":"\nWe consider the theory of capillary-induced interactions beyond the superposition approximation. We show that the dynamics of wetting and dewetting of a solid substrate by a liquid can be described by a general mathematical framework that accounts for the nonlocal nature of capillary interactions. Our approach is based on the notion of a boundary mode, which is a particular type of eigenmode of the Laplace operator that is invariant under the superposition approximation. We show that the nonlocal interaction between a solid substrate and a liquid can be expressed as a sum of boundary modes, and that this expression is valid beyond the superposition approximation. This theory enables us to study the rich set of wetting and dewetting dynamics that are beyond the scope of the superposition approximation, including the formation of liquid bridges and the break-up of wetting films. We show that these dynamics can be understood in terms of the symmetry and stability of the various boundary modes that are involved. We also discuss the practical implications of this theory for the design of functionalized surfaces and interfaces."}
{"text":"\nWe consider the problem of computing the determinant of a matrix whose entries are each a polynomial expression in one variable. We show that, if the coefficients of these expressions are rational numbers, then the determinant can be expressed as a polynomial in the variables of the matrix, using only the rules of algebra for multiplying and for taking the inverse of a polynomial. This formula is an analogue of the well-known fingering rule for the determinant of a matrix whose entries are algebraic expressions. We then consider the problem of computing the determinant of a matrix whose entries are each a transcendental function of one variable. We show that, if the coefficients of these functions are algebraic numbers, then the determinant can be expressed as a polynomial in the variables of the matrix, using only the rules of algebra for multiplying and for taking the inverse of a polynomial. This formula is an analogue of the fingering rule for the determinant of a matrix whose entries are transcendental functions. We show that the class of matrices for which our algorithms are guaranteed to compute the determinant exactly is strictly contained in the class of matrices for which the fingering rule computes the determinant exactly. Finally, we show that our algorithms can be implemented in a way that is computationally more efficient than the fingering rule."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present the discovery of two extremely low luminosity Milky Way globular clusters. These objects, designated TYC 9135-697-1 and TYC 9138-31-1, were found in the course of a visual search for extremely low luminosity stars in the globular cluster region of the Milky Way. The clusters have Teff's of about 5700 K and 6000 K, radii of 1.3 and 1.2 pc, and ages of 11.4 and 12.4 Gyr, respectively. TYC 9138-31-1 is a member of the proposed ' Gaia globular cluster, while TYC 9135-697-1 is a new cluster. We estimate that the globular cluster region of the Milky Way contains many more extremely low luminosity clusters like these two, possibly as many as several hundred. These clusters are extremely faint because they are very distant from the Galactic plane. We estimate that the tidal effect of the Galactic potential has halved the number of members of each cluster. TYC 9138-31-1 is a member of the proposed Gaia cluster. The clusters contain many blue straggler stars, and have a higher than average fraction of metallic-line stars. TYC 9135-697-1 has a small percentage of population II stars, consistent with its age. These clusters appear to be very rich, and they contain many more blue straggler stars than would be expected from the few field stars we could identify. The blue straggler fraction, and the very low metallicity of the two clusters are consistent with their extreme distance from the Galactic plane. The clusters are not very flat, but have a range of orbital elements, and do not have very small orbits. The high metallicity of TYC 9138-31-1 makes it unlikely that it is a member of the proposed Gaia cluster. The very low metallicity of TYC 9135-697-1 is consistent with its small number of population II stars. We discuss these clusters in the context of known extremely low luminosity clusters in the Milky Way and in the Local Group."}
{"text":"\nWe present a three-stranded quantum algorithm for computing the Jones polynomial of a given knot, which is a fundamental problem in both mathematics and quantum information theory. Our algorithm is based on the concept of a \" DNF (Do Not Forget) state,\" which is a generalization of a pure state to three or more qubits. We show that a sequence of DNF states can be constructed so that each evolves under quantum dynamics to the next, and the final state encodes the answer to the Jones polynomial. We analyze the algorithm's performance and show that it converges to the correct answer with high probability. Our algorithm also relates the Jones polynomial to the \"communication complexity\" of a graph, which measures the number of bits that two processors need to exchange in order to solve a joint computation. Our results establish a three-stranded version of a fundamental result due tomanship, which shows that the Jones polynomial can be computed by quantum communication, provided that the involved qubits can be \"teleported\" between the two processors."}
{"text":"\n\nWe investigate a class of random socioeconomic networks with long-range interactions, which are motivated by many real-world social and information networks, where both local and non-local connections are important. We find that these networks are characterized by a few strongly connected nodes (or communities), which are connected to each other by a small number of links, and many weakly connected nodes, which are connected mostly to the strongly connected nodes by a large number of links. This is in sharp contrast to the properties of random networks without long-range interactions, where the degree distribution is power law and the average path length is small. We find that the PageRank algorithm is inefficient in these networks, because it is designed to operate on networks with many local connections. We develop a simple modification of the PageRank algorithm that takes into account the non-local connections, and show that this modified algorithm is more efficient in discovering the strongly connected nodes. Our results suggest that the community detection methods based on the local interactions may be further improved by taking into account the non-local interactions."}
{"text":"\nWe present a detailed comparison of the 3-yr WMAP results with the Cosmological Slingshot Primordial Spectrum (COPS) in the regime $10^{-5} \\le q \\le 10^{-3}$. We show that the agreement between the two methods is excellent over the entire range of mass ratios $q$ and for all three elements of the COPS (the Dirac, Flip, and Jazz components). We explain the origin of a small disagreement between the WMAP results and the Flip and Jazz components of the COPS in the regime $q \\sim 10^{-4}$. We show that a simple model in which the primordial spectrum is the COPS multiplied by a small smooth function, can quantitatively reproduce the WMAP results. The model can be further simplified by assuming that the amplitude of the spectrum is inversely proportional to $q^2$. This model can be used to extract the amplitude of the spectrum in the range $q \\sim 10^{-4}$ to $q \\sim 10^{-2}$ with an accuracy comparable to that of the WMAP analysis. We explain why this model is consistent with the assumption that the primordial spectrum is the COPS multiplied by a small smooth function."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present improved constraints on the equation of state (EOS) of dark energy from Chandra X-ray observations of the largest relaxed galaxy clusters. We use the clusters as cosmic rulers to measure the scale dependence of the large-scale structure (LSS) power spectrum, P(k), and the cluster abundance distribution, N(z), in order to constrain the EOS. We find that the cluster abundance distribution is consistent with a simple model in which the number density of clusters is proportional to the volume density of the universe, with a power law index of 1.91 \u00b1 0.05. This implies that the clusters trace the LSS with a scale dependence given by P(k) = 1 + \u03c1bn(0)ek, where \u03c1 is the power law index, b is the bias factor, and n(0) is the minimum power law scale. The measured scale dependence of P(k) is consistent with this prediction, with \u03c1 = 1.35 \u00b1 0.06 and n(0) = 7.58 \u00b1 0.07. The combination of these results implies a stringent constraint on the EOS, with a non-zero deceleration parameter q < 1.4."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider the problem of constructing a converging sequence of estimates for a solution to a stochastic differential equation with jumps by means of Extrapolation Formulae (EFs) which are alternating between deterministic and stochastic differential equations. Such a sequence is called a Mixed Action Extrapolation Formula (MAEF). We show that, under suitable regularity conditions, the set of all MAEFs has a naturalubounded basis which we call the Universal MAEF Basis. This basis is obtained by starting from a general MAEF and then expressing it as a linear combination of basis elements, each of which is an EF. We show that this basis is in fact closed under differentiation, which implies that any MAEF can be expressed as a linear combination of basis elements. We also show that any system of MAEFs can be written as a linear combination of basis elements. These results are applied to give a simple description of the class of MAEFs which have a particular property, namely that of being unconditionally stable."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider the duality between the two-dimensional black hole and the electromagnetic field in a strong magnetic field, which is a generalization of the well-known Fock-Zakota-Zurek (FZZ) duality to the case of a cylindrical black hole. The duality is related to the analog of the Euler-Heisenberg pendant group in the presence of a non-Abelian group symmetry. The motivation for the research is to explore the boundaries of the original FZZ-duality in the framework of the current theory, in the case of a non-rotating black hole with a mirror symmetry in the axial direction. We show that the structure of the resulting duality is similar to that of the original FZZ-duality in some aspects, but different in others. In particular, we find that the two-dimensional black hole has a twisted FZZ-like dual, which consists of a pair of surface modes living on the boundary of the two-dimensional black hole, and the bulk structure of this dual is related to the \"twisted\" bulk of the original FZZ-duality. We show that the twist angle of this dual is proportional to the golden angle. The problem this work attempts to solve is to find a generalization of the FZZ-duality to the case of a cylindrical black hole, which is motivated by the recent progress in the study of black holes with a non-Abelian group symmetry. The practical application of this work is in the field of quantum information theory, where the FZZ-duality is used to study the complexity of quantum computation with black holes. The theoretical application of this work is in the field of quantum gravity, where the FZZ-duality is used to study the relationship between the two-dimensional black hole and the electromagnetic field in a strong magnetic field."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate a perpendicular magnetic field induced spin Hall conductance in a two dimensional electron gas (2DEG) system. The system is a GaAs\/AlxGa1-xAs quantum well with a perpendicular magnetic field applied to the plane of the quantum well. We show that anisotropic spin dependent transport can be obtained in the absence of any magnetic material in the system. The key idea is to use the spin dependent Zeeman energy in the 2DEG as a source of spin Hall conductance. Our theoretical analysis shows that the Zeeman energy in the 2DEG can be enhanced by an order of magnitude by using a perpendicular magnetic field and can reach values large enough to be a significant source of spin Hall conductance. We observe that the spin Hall conductance in the 2DEG has a strong temperature dependence and a non-monotonic behavior as a function of the perpendicular magnetic field. We explain these behaviors by a model which takes into account the dependence of the Zeeman energy on temperature and the renormalization of the 2DEG energy bands due to the perpendicular magnetic field. The results of our work may have practical applications in spintronic devices based on 2DEG systems."}
{"text":"\nWe present a Bayesian approach to the modelling of strong lensing data for galaxy clusters, motivated by the need to jointly model multiple datasets in an objective and statistically consistent manner. We consider the joint modelling of strong lensing and galaxy cluster redshift data, where the strong lensing data is contaminated by noise and measurement errors. We model the redshift data using a Gaussian process prior and the strong lensing data using a latent Gaussian model. We jointly infer the cluster redshift and strong lensing parameters using a Gaussian process emulator. We evaluate the method on both simulated data and real data from the cluster Strong Lensing Survey. For the simulated data we compare our method to other state-of-the-art strong lensing modelling techniques, and for the real data we infer the cluster parameters and use the inferred strong lensing model to produce a mock strong lensing image. We find that our method is competitive in terms of model prediction and clustering performance when compared to other methods."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider a model of massive and massless neutrinos on unbalanced seesaws, which can be thought of as a simple model of the early Universe in which the seesaws represent the density fluctuations of the Universe and the neutrinos are the perturbations that propagate on them. We show that the same equation that describes the propagation of the perturbations on the seesaws also describes the dynamics of the evolution of the Universe, in particular the formation of structure. This equation is shown to be very similar to the Einstein equation, in the sense that the evolution of the Universe is completely determined by the initial conditions and the constant of the equation, which is related to the critical density of the Universe. We also show that the evolution of the Universe can be very well described by the massive and massless neutrinos on unbalanced seesaws if the initial conditions are such that the evolution of the Universe is very slow and the structure is formed very gradually. If the evolution is fast, however, the structure is formed in a very violent way and the evolution of the Universe is not well described by the massive and massless neutrinos on unbalanced seesaws. We discuss several possibilities to improve the description of the evolution of the Universe by this model."}

{"text":"\nWe investigate the statistical mechanics of the nematic phase by means of a functional renormalization group approach. The model we consider is a simple variant of the dreadfully simple (DS) model that has the same potential function as the one considered by Smith and Clinical, but with different boundary conditions and an extra potential term that has a non-zero value only for the directors perpendicular to the easy axis. In a first approximation, this model has the same statistical mechanics as the original DS model. We evaluate the pair correlation functions and show that they have the same functional form as the pair correlation functions of the DS model, with the exception of an extra term that has a non-zero value only when the two directors are perpendicular to each other. We show that this term can be understood as a non-zero value of the singlet correlation function, and relate it to the violation of mirror symmetry in the nematic phase. The fact that the pair correlation functions of our model have the same functional form as the pair correlation functions of the DS model suggests that the statistical mechanics of our model is described by the same free-energy functional as the statistical mechanics of the DS model. We evaluate this functional and show that it has an extra term that is proportional to the inverse of the cosine of the angle between the two directors. This term is related to the fact that the free energy has a non-vector symmetry under mirror reflections."}

{"text":"\n\nWe present the discovery of a massive supercluster at z=0.9 in the UKIDSS DXS. The supercluster, with a length of approximately 3 degrees, is composed of galaxies in the redshift range 0.1-1.2, with a peak at z=0.9. It is found in a wide area of the sky, covering the northern part of the Small Magellanic Cloud, and it is therefore not associated with any known large-scale structure. We find that the supercluster has a total mass of M1=5.2kHzMpc-1 within a radius of R1=0.6Mpc, corresponding to a density of \u03c11=0.24\u03a30.5, where \u03a3 is the total mass density of the Universe and \u03c1 is the cluster mass density. Within this radius, the number density of galaxies is \u03c1n=0.3-0.4Gpc-3. This is several times higher than the value found in the local supercluster, but it is in agreement with the number density of galaxies in the distant supercluster at z=2.2. The cluster also shows a large peak in the temperature field, T0=2.2K, and a high level of ionization, log(O\/H)0=7.5dex, which indicates that it is in a state of high-energy density. The discovery of this supercluster has implications for theories of structure formation in the Universe, and it provides a possible explanation for the origin of large-scale structure in the Universe."}
{"text":"\n\nThe early evolution of tidal dwarf galaxies\n\nWe present a numerical study of the evolution of tidal dwarf galaxies. We have implemented a version of the Newtonian potential field code PFR4 with the aim of understanding the role of the internal structure of these galaxies in their evolution. We find that the internal structure of a dwarf galaxy can be closely related to its formation history. The results of our study are consistent with a picture in which the accretion history of a dwarf galaxy is the main driver of its internal structure and evolution. We show that in order to obtain a simple model that is capable of producing the main observed properties of tidal dwarf galaxies, the most important physical ingredient is the efficient mixing of the accreted material. We have also found that the nature of the potential field in the outskirts of the galaxy has only a minor effect on the evolution of the system. The main implication of our work is that the internal structure of a dwarf galaxy is primarily determined by the properties of the accretion events that the galaxy has undergone during its evolution, and not by the particular form of the potential field that describes the dynamics in the outer regions of the system."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a novel L-band (1.4 $\\mu$m) imaging search for giant planets in the Tucana and Beta Pictoris moving groups. We use high-contrast imaging with the Hubble Space Telescope to search for absorption by giant planets in the L-band radiation from six red-giant stars in the Tucana group and five in the Beta Pictoris group. We have obtained high-contrast images of the stellar companions in these systems, but we have not detected any giant planets. We place upper limits on the star-hugging orbits of giant planets in these systems, and we conclude that giant planets in these systems would have a large probability of being detected with our method if they exist. We therefore place upper limits on the masses of giant planets in these systems. For the Tucana group, we place an upper limit of $3.7-4.9J_{\\odot}$ on the mass of a giant planet with a star-hugging orbit, and for the Beta Pictoris group we place an upper limit of $2.4-4.9J_{\\odot}$ on the mass of a giant planet with a star-hugging orbit. These upper limits can be compared to the masses of giant planets detected around other stars with the same method. We conclude that there are no giant planets in these systems with masses greater than a few $J_{\\odot}$. This rules out giant planets as the cause of the non-Keplerian motion seen in the Tucana group, and it refutes suggestions that giant planets might exist in the Beta Pictoris group."}
{"text":"\n\nWe introduce a new formalism for describing and categorizing the basic concepts of algorithmic reduction as used in the theory of automated reasoning. Our approach is based on a careful analysis of the fundamental properties of reduction and the basic concepts that capture them. We show that the spectrum of reduction concepts can be divided into two distinct classes, which we call normal reduction and\ud83d\udc36\n\nrecursion reduction. The important difference between these two classes is that while the concepts in normal reduction capture the basic idea of reduction in a direct and explicit way, the concepts in recursion reduction capture it in an indirect and implicit way, by means of a recursive definition. We show that the two classes of reduction concepts are related by a simple bijection, which we call the reduction election, and that this bijection preserves many of the basic properties of reduction. As a result, the two classes of reduction concepts can be thought of as two different ways of looking at the same fundamental concept, which we call the reduction principle. The two classes of reduction concepts are shown to be equivalent in the sense that any statement that can be expressed using only the concepts from one class can also be expressed using only the concepts from the other class. The new formalism is applied to provide a simple and direct proof of the relationships between the reduction concepts and the important properties of reduction."}
{"text":"\n\nWe study a quantum wire with a local Rashba interaction that is subjected to a perpendicular magnetic field. The low-lying electronic states, which are completely spin-split in the absence of the field, become weakly or even strongly modulated as the field is increased. We show that this unusual effect is due to a competition between the local Rashba interaction and the magnetic field, which results in the appearance of an additional, non-trivial band structure with respect to the elementary bands of the unmodulated case. Our main tool is a microscopic tight-binding model that is capable of describing the full range of the strength of the local Rashba interaction. We find that a substantial enhancement of the transmission of the spin-split states can be achieved by a proper choice of the parameters of the model, and that the effect is particularly pronounced for a strong local Rashba interaction and a large magnetic field. Our results suggest that a proper design of the local Rashba interaction may be beneficial for spintronic applications."}
{"text":"\n\nWe propose a new template family for the detection and characterization of gravitational waves from comparable mass black hole binaries. Our template family is motivated by the recent observation of GW 204 by the LIGO detectors. The template family is based on the systematic modification of the generic templates of the LIGO search, by changing the chirality of the orbit and the location of the binary on the plane of the sky. We show that a suitable choice of these parameters can produce signals with nearly the same frequency and power as the one observed in GW 204, and with a roughly similar timing distribution. We analyze the detectability of such signals with the current LIGO detectors, and in several runs of the LIGO search with different choices of the template parameters. We conclude that such signals are unlikely to have been detected in the current LIGO data, but could have been detected in earlier runs of the LIGO search with different parameters. Hence, our template family can be used to search for gravitational waves from comparable mass black hole binaries that may have been produced by such earlier runs."}
{"text":"\nWe study the effect of electron-electron interaction on the statistics of conductance oscillations in a quantum dot with two resonant energy levels. We consider a model in which the dot is weakly coupled to a linear reservoir and the driving is provided by a bias current applied to the reservoir. Our theory is based on the combination of a master equation for the probability distribution of the occupation of the quantum dot with an extension of the Einstein-Jacobi theory of quasi-periodic stochastic processes to the case of a non-Markovian system. The model parameters are adjusted to match the experimental data for a number of experiments. We show that the theory predicts a number of interesting features of the statistics of the conductance oscillations, in particular a decrease of the standard deviation of the conductance amplitude as a function of the dephasing time. Our predictions are consistent with a number of experimental observations, but do not agree with other experiments in which the dephasing time is large. We discuss possible physical reasons for this disagreement."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate the set of all possible magnification relations for a general spherically symmetricmetrically bent spacetime, which includes the Euclidean case, the curved spherical case and the Lorentzian case. For each of these three cases we derive an explicit expression for the magnification function in terms of the bulk fields and their derivatives. This general approach allows us to avoid the use of local coordinates and thus to avoid the associated coordinate singularities. In addition, we show that the structure of the resulting magnification function is significantly different for the three different cases, which enables one to distinguish between the three different geometric structures by a careful study of the local properties of the magnification function. We then consider the special case of a spherically symmetric spacetime with a vanishing cosmological constant and a symmetrically bent spacetime, and show that in both cases the resulting magnification functions are identical. We discuss the implications of our results for the possibility of testing cosmic censorship and for the structure of spacetime in general."}
{"text":"\nWe present an analysis of the X-ray emission from the stellarburst supernova remnant Mkr 841. We find that the bulk of the X-ray emission is due to a new class of X-ray sources, consisting of a compact object with a magnetic field and a low-mass companion. This type of X-ray source is responsible for the X-ray emission from the central engine of Mkr 841, as well as for the arc-like X-ray feature seen to the west of the supernova remnant. We show that the iron line complex, observed in absorption toward the central engine, arises from the low-mass companion, while the broad band X-ray continuum is produced by the compact object. We estimate the magnetic field strength of the compact object to be B_ Compact \u223c 4 \u00d7 10^5 G cm^(3), which is much stronger than the magnetic field strength estimated for the low-mass companion (B_M \u223c 100 G cm^(3)). We suggest that the low-mass companion is a captive dwarf star that was pulled-in by the compact object during the gravitational collapse of the giant molecular cloud that gave rise to the stellarburst. Our results reveal a new physical mechanism for the formation of X-ray sources in supernova remnants."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider the problem of the largest eigenvalues of finite rank deformation of large Wigner matrices. We show that the fluctuations of the largest eigenvalue of such a matrix are not universal, in the sense that the distribution of the largest eigenvalue of a large random Wigner matrix is not the same as the distribution of the largest eigenvalue of a large random deformation of a Wigner matrix. We show that the distribution of the largest eigenvalue of a large random deformation of a Wigner matrix depends on the underlying matrix. In particular, we show that the distribution of the largest eigenvalue of a large random deformation of a Wigner matrix converges to the largest eigenvalue distribution of a large random symmetric Toeplitz matrix, as the size of the matrix grows large. We show that this convergence is very slow, in the sense that the largest eigenvalue distribution of a large random deformation of a Wigner matrix converges to the largest eigenvalue distribution of a large random symmetric Toeplitz matrix in an algebraically slow way as the size of the matrix grows large."}
{"text":"\n\nThe paper presents a study of the structure of hypersonic shock waves using the Navier-Stokes equations modified to include mass diffusion. The motivation for the research was to investigate the structure of hypersonic shock waves in a boundary layer that includes both thermodynamic and kinetic energy. The key idea was to use the Navier-Stokes equations with mass diffusion to model the flow in the boundary layer. The methodology was to solve the Navier-Stokes equations with mass diffusion using the Alternating Direction Implicit (ADI) method. The results obtained were compared with previous work that used the Navier-Stokes equations without mass diffusion. The problem that the work attempts to solve is to understand the structure of hypersonic shock waves in a boundary layer that includes both thermodynamic and kinetic energy. The practical application of the work is to improve the understanding of the structure of hypersonic shock waves in a boundary layer. The theoretical application of the work is to validate the use of the Navier-Stokes equations with mass diffusion to model the flow in the boundary layer."}
{"text":"\nWe consider transport through mesoscopic superconductor-normal metal tunnel structures. We show that the transport can be strongly affected by anisotropic spin-dependent phenomena in the normal metal, in particular, by the spin-dependent contribution to the induced hyperfine field in the normal metal. Two different geometries are considered: the first one in which the current is injected in the superconductor, and the second one in which the current is injected in the normal metal. In both cases the transport is dominated by the spin-dependent phenomena. We show that a clear signature of this effect is a giant enhancement of the tunneling current in the superconducting state with respect to the normal state, in spite of the fact that the tunneling matrix element is practically independent of the spin-orientation of the normal metal. We also show that the current-voltage characteristics can be altered by a large spin-dependent tunneling barrier, which results in an anisotropic effective tunneling barrier. In particular we found a dramatic increase of the threshold voltage for the superconducting transition, if the spin orientation of the normal metal is parallel to the applied electric field. This effect can be used for a fast and strong control of the superconducting state by a spin-orbit interaction. We also found a large effect of the non-equilibrium spin dynamics on the transport. In particular we found a giant increase of the tunneling current if the spin-orbit interaction is not symmetric with respect to the directions of the current and the spin. We show that this effect is related to a non-equilibrium spin accumulation in the normal metal. We also found a strong enhancement of the superconducting transition if the spin-orbit interaction is not symmetric with respect to the directions of the current and the spin. Our results suggest a novel way for the control of the superconducting state by non-equilibrium spin-dependent phenomena."}
{"text":"\n\nWe study the impact of noise on the simulation of interacting high-dimensional systems. We consider both  systems with a fixed dimension and those that are evolving in a high-dimensional space. We show that noise can considerably affect the behavior of the ground state and the low-lying excitations of the simulated system. We analyze the sources of these changes and discuss their practical consequences. Our main results can be summarized as follows. (i) In general, the influence of noise on the dynamics of a many-body system is highly non-trivial and can lead to a variety of different effects. (ii) For systems evolving in a high-dimensional space, we show that the dimension of the space can drastically affect the amount of noise required to produce a specific effect. (iii) We also show that noise can have a very different impact on the low-lying excitations of a system than on the ground state. (iv) Our results suggest that a detailed understanding of the effects of noise on the dynamics of many-body systems is required in order to make efficient use of current and future quantum computers."}
{"text":"\nWe present a cross-disciplinary framework for the description of contexts and the way they change over time. The framework is fundamentally constructive in that it does not assume a priori categories for the description of contexts but rather reconstructs contexts from simultaneously observable physical cues in the environment. We provide a classification of these cues and show how they can be used to describe the way a context evolves over time. The framework is motivated by the observation that context mediation is an important phenomenon that is relevant to a broad range of disciplines, including geography, linguistics, biology, and psychology, but that there is a lack of cross-disciplinary consensus about how to describe context and the way it changes. We illustrate the use of the framework by describing how it can be used to record observations of context change in different disciplinary contexts. We also show how the framework can be used to describe hypothetical contexts and the way they change. We conclude that the framework provides a useful descriptive tool with application in a variety of disciplines and with relevance to different levels of observation, from the description of linguistic context to the description of spatial contexts."}
{"text":"\nWe propose a simple model of a neuron with a linear threshold that is trained to perform a classification task. We find that the weights of this neuron are determined by two conditions: the fastest route to reach the threshold from the resting value and the fastest route from the threshold to the opposite limit of the range. When the weights of such a neuron are trained with backpropagation, we find that a path with many small updates is followed. We show that this is equivalent to performing many classifications with small training sets. We also show that the set of weights of the neuron is equivalent to the set of images in the training set. These results are consistent with a theory of the competition between paths to the threshold, and the annealing of the weights along the fastest paths. We show that the set of weights of the neuron corresponds to a probability distribution on the set of images, and that this distribution is the only distribution that the output stream of the neuron can be."}
{"text":"\nWe present a method for measuring the structure of the Universe on very large scales, by measuring the peculiar velocities of galaxies. Our method is independent of the peculiar motions of galaxies in clusters and relies on the anisotropy of the Hubble diagram: the correlation function of the galaxies' peculiar velocities has a different structure when the galaxies are divided into different hemispheres. We show that, when the galaxies are divided according to their local group, the correlation function is well described by a parametric form, which in turn is related to the large scale structure of the Universe. Our method does not require an estimate of the scale of the structure and can therefore be used to probe structure at very large scales, beyond the volume of the Local Group. We find that the correlation function of the peculiar velocities in both hemispheres is well described by a power law, with the same power law index in both hemispheres. The correlation length, however, is different in the two hemispheres: in the direction of thestructure it is relatively long, and in the opposite direction it is relatively short. The difference in the correlation lengths is consistent with the current standard model of structure formation, in which the structure forms from small scale fluctuations, which grow according to the power law, and the large scale structure is anisotropic."}
{"text":"\nWe consider a simple model of random matrices which is based on the independence of the entries of the matrix from each other and from the entries of the second row and second column. We show that such matrices have a specific distribution of the Mahalanobis metric and that this distribution depends only on the variance profile of the matrix, which is described by two parameters. This allows us to introduce a family of distributions of the Mahalanobis metric which is indexed by the variance profile. We show that this family has a limiting distribution which is an equivariant diffusion process. We obtain the distribution of the Trace of the matrix, which allows us to introduce a random symmetric positive definite matrix with a given variance profile. We show that this random matrix has a limiting distribution which is the normal random symmetric positive definite matrix. As an application, we show that the limiting distribution of the gradient of the mutual information is the Fr\u00e9chet random gradient."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider the problem of selecting an appropriate distance measure for use in a large number of statistical learning procedures. The choice of a metric has a substantial effect on the results of the analysis. We focus on a class of distance measures that are defined on the space of probability distributions, and in particular on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) distance. The KL distance has received much less attention in the statistical learning community than the Euclidean distance, even though the former is equivalent to the posterior variance when the data are generated from a mixture distribution. In this paper we consider the properties of the KL distance from the perspective of statistical learning theory. In particular, we show that the KL distance is closely related to the amount of information that is filtered from the data by a certain class of probability distributions. We develop a formalism for estimating the KL distance from data, and we show how this can be used to select the number of components in a mixture distribution. We demonstrate the practical usefulness of the KL distance by means of an example taken from the field of bioinformatics."}

{"text":"\nWe show that the running cosmological constant, as obtained from the analysis of the cosmic microwave background radiation, has an entropy signature that is consistent with the assumption that the cosmological constant is a pure quantum state. We consider a general scheme for quantizing the cosmological constant that is invariant under general coordinate transformations and does not require the introduction of a cosmological constant term in the action function. The resulting quantum state is shown to have a particular entropy signature that can be tested against the entropy signature of the running cosmological constant. The entropy signature of the running cosmological constant as extracted from the analysis of the cosmic microwave background radiation is consistent with the cosmological constant being a pure quantum state. We show that the bulk behavior of the entropy signature is a special case of the 'folded spectrum' entropy signature associated with a particular type of general coordinate transformation. The special case of the folded spectrum entropy signature that we consider is shown to be consistent with the assumption that the cosmological constant is a pure quantum state. We discuss a simple physical model that can produce a folded spectrum entropy signature and show that this model is consistent with the assumption that the cosmological constant is a pure quantum state. We also show that the cosine-symmetry of the spatial variations of the cosmological constant is consistent with the assumption that the cosmological constant is a pure quantum state."}
{"text":"\n\nWe study the spin effect on the resonant tunneling characteristics of a double-barrier heterostructure under longitudinal stresses. We show that the spin-dependent splitting of the electron levels in the quantum well changes in a manner that is consistent with the energy-level diagram but not with the selection rule for resonant tunneling. Our results are explained by a model in which the spatial profile of the electron wave function in the quantum well is altered by longitudinal stresses in a way that changes the relative orientation of the electron and hole sub-levels in the well. Since the selection rule is defined with respect to the centers of the sub-levels, a change in the relative orientation of the sub-levels can lead to a change in the selection rule. Our model predicts that the spin effect on the tunneling characteristics is related to the strength of the longitudinal stresses and the thickness of the quantum well. We discuss the physical origin of the predicted effects and possible practical applications."}
{"text":"\nWe discuss a Regge approach to the problem of charged-pion photoproduction at invariant energies above 2 GeV. We show that the basic Regge mechanism of pion-pion exchange is relevant in this energy region provided that the virtual-pion exchange is treated properly. This requires an extension of the Regge approach to include virtual-pion exchange in the framework of the meson-exchange theory. In the low-energy region, we have a good understanding of the virtual-pion exchange; the inclusion of the virtual-pion exchange in the meson-exchange theory is not problematical. The situation is quite different in the high-energy region. The pion-pion exchange at high energy can be treated within the framework of the meson-exchange theory, whereas the virtual-pion exchange at high energy is very complicated and is not yet properly understood. We discuss a general procedure of the Regge approach to charged-pion photoproduction at invariant energies above 2 GeV. We evaluate the contribution of the various mechanisms to the photoproduction cross section and the corresponding electron-pion coupling constant, and find good agreement with the available data. The main problem of the Regge approach is the lack of an adequate theory of the virtual-pion exchange at high energy."}
{"text":"\n\nWe have performed a systematic study of the pressure induced insulator-metal transition in LaMnO3. The resistivity was found to increase with pressure in a non-monotonic fashion. The non-monotonic behavior was found to be related to the structural transition from the insulating tetragonal phase to the metallic rhombohedral phase. In addition to the resistivity, we have also measured the DC Hall coefficient as a function of pressure. The DC Hall coefficient was found to decrease with pressure, in a fashion similar to the resistivity. We have also investigated the temperature dependent resistivity and DC Hall coefficient as functions of pressure. A strong temperature dependence of the resistivity and DC Hall coefficient was observed. The temperature dependence of the resistivity and DC Hall coefficient was found to be related to the structural phase transition. In addition, we have studied the AC Hall coefficient as a function of frequency, temperature and pressure. The AC Hall coefficient was found to exhibit a strong frequency dependence. The temperature and pressure dependencies of the AC Hall coefficient were also studied. The temperature and pressure dependencies of the AC Hall coefficient were found to be related to the structural phase transition."}
{"text":"\nWe introduce a simple physical model of excluded volume and local structural cooperativity to study the effects of these factors on the polymer physics of protein folding. Our results show a direct, qualitative connection between excluded volume and the polymer physics of protein folding, in terms of the behavior of the freely-jointed chain model. We show that excluded volume is equivalent to a increase of the internal energy of the freely-jointed chain model, that is, a positive bend energy. We derive a simple approximation for the effect of excluded volume on the folding rate, which we term the \"local cooperativity approximation\". This approximation is exact for a large class of simple protein structures. Our results show that the folding rate is proportional to the square of the number of residues in the protein, which is consistent with the observation that proteins with a larger number of residues fold more slowly. We also show that proteins with a higher local cooperativity fold more slowly. Our results suggest that local structural cooperativity and excluded volume are the dominant factors in the polymer physics of protein folding, and they have a large impact on the folding rates of proteins."}
{"text":"\n\nUnstructured oceanographic data is a valuable source of information for ocean monitoring. However, the analysis and interpretation of such data is a challenging task, especially for 3D data sets. We have developed a set of diagnostic tools for 3D unstructured oceanographic data that allows for the interactive and semi-automatic analysis and interpretation of such data sets. The tools are based on the concept of identifying and tracking significant features in the data set, which can be used to identify different ocean phenomena, such as eddies, fronts, and vortices. The tools also provide a means for visualizing the data in a way that makes it easier to identify and understand the underlying ocean processes. The tools have been tested on a number of 3D data sets, including data from ocean monitoring programs and from various research projects, and have been shown to be effective in the analysis and interpretation of such data. The tools are available for download and use, and have been incorporated into the analysis workflow of a number of research groups."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations of seven BL Lacertae objects (BL Lac objects) from the Rochester\/Detroit\/Haystack (RGB) sample. These observations are part of a program to obtain relative VLBI measurements of 24 BL Lac objects from the RGB sample in order to study their proper motions and other properties. We describe the methods used to reduce the data and extract the proper motions, and present the proper motion and other properties of the seven objects observed. The observations are accurate to about 2 milliarcseconds (mas) for proper motion, and the statistical uncertainty is about 2 mas\/yr. We find that the proper motion of BL Lac objects is typically larger than that of flat-spectrum radio sources (FSRs), but a large fraction of the motion in both BL Lac objects and FSRs is due to the Galactic motion. We find that at least 5% of the BL Lac objects in the RGB sample have proper motions larger than 2,000 mas\/yr (0.7 kpc\/Myr), indicating that these objects are likely to be well beyond the Local Volume, and thus are not members of the Galactic Globular Clusters. The largest proper motion we measure is 2.9 kpc\/Myr (6,800 mas\/yr), which is three times larger than the largest Galactic proper motion measured in the RGB sample (1.3 kpc\/Myr). We discuss the likely physical mechanisms that can produce large proper motions in BL Lac objects, and find that a large fraction of the high proper motion BL Lac objects are likely to be escaping the Local Volume rather than falling into the Galactic Globular Clusters."}
{"text":"\n\nAtomic force microscopy (AFM) study of thick lamellar stacks of phospholipid bilayers\n\nThe packing and organization of biological molecules in artificial lipid bilayers is important to understand the mechanisms of cell membranes, the basis of the liposomal drug delivery systems, and the self-assembly of lipids. We used atomic force microscopy (AFM) to image the structure of thick lamellar stacks of lipid bilayers formed by the lipid mixtures of DSPC (1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) and DPPG (1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-rac-(1-glycerol)). In this system, DSPC and DPPG were in a 3:1 ratio, and the final lipid concentration was 5 mg\/ml. We used a Department of Defense AFM with a probe scanner, a Nanosensors NCLAS cantilever with a single-walled carbon nanotube tip, and a fluid cell for AFM imaging in a liquid environment. The images showed that the phospholipid molecules were packed in a lateral orientation, forming a series of layers along the fast scan direction. The distance between the layers was approximately 4 nm, corresponding to the thickness of a single lipid bilayer. The number of layers was larger in the middle of the image, where the structure was more compact and had a higher height, and it gradually decreased toward the edges, where the structure was more open and had a lower height. The difference in height between the compact region and the open region was approximately 2 nm, which was equivalent to the length of a single lipid molecule. The fast scan direction of the image was coincident with the long axis of the lipid molecules, which were highly ordered in the lateral direction. Our results showed that the lipid molecules were packed in a series of ordered layers and the packing was highly dependent on the distribution of molecules."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a detailed study of the correlation between the assembly histories of dark matter haloes and the corresponding galaxy groups. We use a combination of numerical simulations and analysis of observations to show that the correlation is driven by the fact that galaxies are more likely to be found within haloes that have accretion history similar to that of the group. In particular, we find that the probability that a halo contains a given galaxy group is proportional to the product of the halo's accretion history and the group's accretion history. This implies that the observed correlation is a signature of similar assembly histories, and that it can be used to infer the assembly history of galaxies in groups that are not observed directly. Our results also suggest that the assembly history of a halo can be inferred from the properties of the galaxies it contains, provided that the group they belong to is known. We discuss the implications of our results for galaxy group finding algorithms and for the study of the assembly history of galaxies."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present the first measurement of the AGN fraction in high-redshift clusters of galaxies. We use the galaxy number counts in 27 clusters at redshifts > 1 from the 2 Micron All Sky Survey to determine the galaxy distribution in the clusters, and compare this distribution to the field galaxy number counts in the same survey, in order to derive the fraction of cluster galaxies which are active galactic nuclei (AGN). We find that the AGN fraction increases rapidly with cluster redshift, from roughly 5% at z < 1 to almost 10% at z > 5. We show that this increase is consistent with a model in which the AGN fraction increases linearly with redshift, with a scaling factor of (1 + z)3. We discuss possible physical explanations for this increase, and find that it is consistent with the expectation that the cluster infall rate is proportional to the volume of the cluster, while the number of galaxies per cluster is proportional to the cluster mass. We show that this relation predicts a rapid increase in the AGN fraction at high redshift, consistent with our measurement."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a morphological catalog of 667 nearby (Mpc) galaxies, drawn from the 2 Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS), that have morphologies similar to those of the satellites of the Milky Way and of the Small Magellanic Cloud. We find that the kinematics of these galaxies is well described by a combination of a uniform step function and a radial distribution, which is likely to be due to the infall of these galaxies onto the Galactic and Magellanic clouds. We use the 2MASS photometry to estimate the gas fraction of these galaxies, and find that it is a strong function of morphology: late-type galaxies tend to have a higher gas fraction than early-type galaxies. We also find that the gas fractions of galaxies in the thick disk population are significantly higher than those in the thin disk, and that the gas fraction decreases with galactic radius in both the Milky Way and the Small Magellanic Cloud. These results are consistent with the thick-thin disk structure of the Milky Way, and suggest that the Small Magellanic Cloud may also have a thick-thin structure. We find that the gas fraction has a strong correlation with the star formation rate, with the highest star formation rates occurring in galaxies with gas fractions in the range 0.4-1. We also find that the relation between star formation rate and gas fraction is well described by a power law with a negative power of -0.5. Our results suggest that the relation between gas fraction and star formation rate may be determined by the competition between the gas infall and the radiative feedback from the stellar population."}
{"text":"\n\nRed Sequence Cluster Finding in the Millennium Simulation\n\nWe present a new algorithm to find red sequence clusters in the Millennium Simulation. The motivation for this work is to provide an efficient algorithm to find the large scale structure of the Millennium Simulation. The Millennium Simulation is a large scale numerical simulation of the evolution of the universe. It has been run with different physical parameters, and the results are available as a database. The aim of this work is to investigate the large scale structure of the Millennium Simulation, and to compare the results with the observations of the large scale structure in the universe. The key idea is to use the random forest algorithm to find the red sequence clusters in the Millennium Simulation. The random forest algorithm is a machine learning algorithm that is used to find the clusters in the data. The results of this work show that the random forest algorithm is an effective tool to find the red sequence clusters in the Millennium Simulation."}
{"text":"\nWe present electronic structure calculations for the high-Tc cuprate superconductor Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+d, in order to investigate the effect of the underlying electronic structure on the pair formation mechanism. We employ the locally exact HUCC method, which combines exact exchange with the Heisenberg-U (HU) approximation in a cluster basis-set formalism. The superior quality of the locally exact basis-set Heisenberg-U method (LE-HU) in dealing with strongly correlated electron systems is demonstrated by the excellent agreement of our results with earlier calculations based on the more exact ab-initio methods, such as the large basis-set (LBS) approach and the plane-wave plus local orbitals basis-set (PW+LOC) approach, for the hole-doped cuprate superconductors. We find that a large fraction of the electronic degrees of freedom (DOFs) are tightly localized in the gap between cuprate layers, and that the majority of the remaining DOFs are localized in the CuO2 planes. The pair formation mechanism in the cuprates is discussed within the framework of the single-particle basis-set (SPBS) approach, in terms of the projected basis-set (PBS) indices of the participating electronic DOFs. We show that the dominant contribution to the pair breaking (or anti-pair formation) comes from the DOFs with PBS indices close to (but not equal to) the \" undisputed \" paired PBS index (22). The results suggest that a large fraction of the \" unpaired \" electrons in the cuprate superconductors is in a highly localized \" quasi- paired \" state, and that the traditional S-wave symmetry of the pair breaking mechanism may need to be replaced by a more complicated mechanism with D- and A-wave components."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider random spatial growth in a plane subject to paralyzing obstacles. We assume that growth is isotropic and homogenous in space and that the spatial density of obstacles is small. The growth process is simulated in two dimensions by a random walk algorithm and in three dimensions by a random lattice algorithm. For both simulations we consider a basic model in which the obstacles have a prespecified geometry and a more realistic model in which the obstacles have a random geometry. In both cases we observe that the mean density of the grown pattern is higher near the obstacles. This effect is more pronounced for the random geometry case. For both simulations we also consider a model in which the grown pattern is allowed to go outside the plane, in order to investigate the effect of the spatial dimension. For all simulations we show that the mean density of the grown pattern is independent of the spatial dimension. We also consider the statistical properties of the grown pattern, in particular the variance and the covariance. The variance is shown to be higher for the patterns grown on the plane with obstacles than for the patterns grown without obstacles. This effect is more pronounced for the random geometry case. As a by-product of our investigation we obtain an effective mathematical model of random spatial growth subject to paralyzing obstacles, which can be viewed as a random walk in a graph with edges and vertexes representing regions of paralyzing obstacles."}
{"text":"\n\nLong-term tidal evolution of short-period planets with companions\n\nWe consider the long-term tidal evolution of a short-period planet with a close-in companion of mass m2 in a circular orbit, as a result of the tidal interactions with the primary star. We show that the total tidal torque acting on the planet is the sum of the tidal torque due to the star and that due to the companion. If the mass of the companion is large compared to that of the planet, the tidal torque due to the companion may be large enough to drive the planet to a different orbit, or even to a different star. We derive an analytic expression for the tidal evolution of the orbital elements of the planet, and show that this evolution is not uniform but rather highly depends on the initial conditions. In particular, we find that the tidal influence of the companion is strongest when the planet is at the closest point to the star. We also discuss the possibility of using the companion as a tide gauge, which would allow a precise determination of the gravitational constant G."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider the end-to-end distortion for a buffered transmission over a fast-fading channel. The transmitter is allowed to precode the data and the receiver is allowed to use a Decision Feedback Equalizer (DFE). We derive a simple expression for the end-to-end distortion which takes into account the finite buffer size and the channel estimation error. We analyze the effect of the precode and the DFE on the end-to-end distortion and we determine the conditions for which the use of a DFE provides a noticeable reduction of the end-to-end distortion. In particular, we show that the use of a DFE is beneficial if the channel variations are sufficiently fast. In this case, the receiver can track the channel variations and use the DFE to correct for the channel estimation error. We also show that the use of a DFE does not improve the performance if the channel varies slowly or if the buffer size is large. In these cases, the DFE cannot track the channel variations and the channel estimation error is not important."}
{"text":"\nWe study the zero-temperature phase of the XY spin glass in two dimensions, using a genetic algorithm to find an embedded matching heuristic. This is the first successful application of a genetic algorithm to the glass problem. The motivation for this work is that the matching heuristic has been proven to be very efficient in finding spin glass ground states, but the conventional wisdom is that this method would not be applicable in two dimensions. We show that the matching heuristic can be made to work in two dimensions, by using a genetic algorithm to evolve a heuristic that is locally very simple, but globally able to find the spin glass ground state. We find the zero-temperature phase in a class of 2D spin glasses that includes the most famous examples, such as the Harris spin glass and the ropes spin glass. Our method is based on the simple idea that we can use a genetic algorithm to learn a heuristic that is locally \"smart\" enough to avoid getting trapped in local minima, while being globally \"dumb\" enough to eventually find the global minimum. We describe our algorithm and the parameter settings used, and present results for several 2D spin glasses."}
{"text":"\nWe present a method of measuring side chain conformational space and assessing the population of rotameric isomers by NMR spectroscopy and molecular mechanics (MM) calculations. The method is based on the observation that the chemical shift data of an amino acid residue in a protein can be described by a three-dimensional distribution ofgaussian peaks, each peak corresponding to a rotameric isomer. By a least-squares fit to the experimental data, the heights and positions of the gaussian peaks can be obtained. From the distribution of the peaks in the three-dimensional space, the number of side chain rotameric isomers and their populations can be obtained. To demonstrate the method, the conformational space of four residues (two glycine residues, one alanine residue, and one serine residue) in the protein cytochrome c was analyzed. The results were compared with those obtained by the molecular dynamics (MD) method. It was found that the two methods gave similar results for the glycine residues, but the NMR method gave slightly different results for the alanine and serine residues from those obtained by the MD method."}
{"text":"\nWe present a p-adic quasi-quadratic point counting algorithm for an elliptic curve over a function field of a proper scheme. Our method is based on the idea of representing the point counting function as a p-adic exponential, and using the structure of the p-adic exponential to derive an efficient algorithm. The main ingredient is a careful analysis of the relation between the exponential and the associated pushing-down argument. We deduce that, if the exponential is represented by a series of poorest terms, the number of terms needed is bounded from above by the number of distinct points on the curve. This bound is tight for the case of elliptic curves over cyclotomic fields, and we deduce that the number of terms is equal to the number of torsion points on the elliptic curve. We present an algorithm for computing this number. As an application, we show that our algorithm is able to count the torsion points of an elliptic curve over a number field in a number of steps that is independent of the conductor of the field."}

{"text":"\nWe systematically analyze a recently proposed spin-susceptibility representation of the pairing interaction in the two-dimensional Hubbard model. This approach has been shown to be applicable to a large number of materials, including various types of bronze, but the basic structure of the underlying model interaction has not been discussed in detail. We show that the framework can be understood in a simple and general way by considering the limit of a random-phase approximation in which the spin-susceptibility representation is exact. The main idea is that a pairing interaction with a large spatial range gives rise to a small but nonzero static spin susceptibility, while the spin-susceptibility representation is exact in the limit of a large static susceptibility. We discuss how this idea can be used to explain various features of the spin-susceptibility representation, including the recently proposed basis-rotational symmetry and the structure of the thermodynamic Green function in the limit of a large system size. We also show that the recent claim of the existence of a pairing-induced magnetic order in the two-dimensional Hubbard model on a square lattice is not supported by the theory."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present the results of a detailed topological analysis of the magnetic field configuration associated with two well-observed M-class flares that occurred in April 2005 and February 2006, and which have been previously analyzed in terms of the 3D reconstruction of their erupted magnetic flux. Our analysis shows that the magnetic field topology of these two flares is very similar, in spite of their being of different total magnetic flux. The field topology is characterized by the presence of a large-scale X-shaped structure, which we name the \"M-flares magnetogram,\" formed by the intersection of four positive magnetic flux regions, two of which are the source of the largest magnetic field derivatives in the whole magnetogram, and which contains the regions of the most intense activity during the flare. We discuss the possible implications of this large-scale structure in the context of flare energy release and the relationship between the flare energy budget and the magnetic field topology."}
{"text":"\n\nWe show how to obtain an approximately bisimulation-based (AB) characterization of the set of nonlinear control systems that can be modeled by a general class of symbolic dynamical systems. The AB characterization is based on a representation of the symbolic dynamics using translation-invariant circuits. We show that the union of the sets of systems that can be modeled by each of the circuits in the representation covers the set of nonlinear control systems. We show that the approximate reachability and containment characterizations of the set of symbolic models are tight for a large class of nonlinear control systems. The key ingredient in our proofs is a new version of the Liapunov\u2013Jacobson rule that works for AB models. We show how to obtain a good numerical approximation of the solutions of a symbolic model by means of a Galerkin-type method. The method can be used to produce a sequence of numerical models, whose solutions approximately converge to the solutions of the symbolic model."}
{"text":"\nWe propose a new concept, which we call charged axially symmetric solution (CASS), to describe the space-time structure of electrogravitational phenomena in teleparallel theory (TPT). Our basic observation is that, in the framework of TPT, the space-time structure of electrogravitational phenomena is invariant under the rotation of the coordinate system. We show that such a structure is described by a CASS. After that, we derive the energy conservation law for the CASS. The energy conservation law in the framework of CASS is equivalent to the energy conservation law in the framework of general relativity (GR). In particular, we show that the GR energy conservation law can be obtained as a special case of the energy conservation law for the CASS. We also show that the geometric structure of the CASS is described by a certain symmetrical tensor and that the components of this tensor can be directly obtained from the components of the energy tensor. Finally, we discuss the physical implications of our results."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present here high resolution radio continuum surveys of the inner part of M33, a nearby spiral galaxy. The surveys have been made with the Swedish-ESO Submillimetre Telescope (SEST) with a sensitivity of about 0.3 mK continuing to 50 GHz. The major part of the data was taken in the B configuration with 4 x 8192 pixels on a 1.6 arcmin field. This area contains a rich galaxy field and the target spiral M33 is in the centre. The observations have been made in the frequency domain with multi-pixel swap, and the images have been made using the WENET package. We present here the maps of all eight frequency pairs in the B configuration, and find a correlation between the integrated radio continuum emission and the optical galaxy number density, but no correlation between the radio continuum flux and the optical luminosity. The results are consistent with a large scale uniformity of the radio continuum distribution, superimposed with small scale fluctuations. The small scale structure is analysed with an isotropic84912) power law with a power law index of -1.45. The strength of the power law is found to be dependent on the frequency and the resolution, but a trend towards a more steep power law with frequency is found. We find that this is consistent with a cosy scenario with large scale structure and small scale structure on top, and discuss our results in the framework of a simple model with a constant field foreground, an extended background and the small scale structure. We also present a catalogue of over 200 radio sources detected in our images. The source distribution is found to be consistent with a random field, with no preference for sources to be placed at the centres of the largest galaxies. We find that the number density of the detected sources is proportional to the optical galaxy number density, but with no clear correlation to the optical luminosity. The source number density is found to be slightly higher than the number density of X-ray sources."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present an analysis of the spatial and kinematic structure of the central and satellite halos in a merging galaxy cluster system, the first study of its kind in a strong dynamical cluster. We find that the satellite halos exhibit significant three-dimensional structures, which we show are due to the ongoing collision between the two clusters. We demonstrate that the spatial and kinematic structures of the satellite halos are consistent with the expectation that the satellites follow orbits about the cluster centre of mass, and that they are not in a state of locked, three-body orbits. We show that the structure of the satellite halos can be used to infer the three-dimensional orbits of the satellites, and to estimate the mass and momentum of the cluster system. We discuss the relevance of our results to the dynamical friction and fluid-dynamical methods of computing the dynamical friction experienced by particles in a cluster.

{"text":"\nWe develop a microscopic theory of light interactions with quantum dots in a semiconductor microcavity, accounting for finite dot position and size, as well as spatial and temporal variations in the light. We show that in spite of the finite size of the dot, which should spoil the localization, the system can still be described by a set of elementary excitations which are localized in space and time. Our theory provides a good description of recent experiments on electromochromic etching of quantum dots. It also explains a new type of strong localization in a shallow semiconductor microcavity, observed in our recent experiments, in terms of a competition between a delocalized surface mode and a localized confined mode. Our theory also suggests a way to achieve strong localization in a deep microcavity, by using a special kind of quantum dot, which has a large enough overlap with the confined mode. We also found a generalization of the Israel-Weiss Grynszpan formula, which describes the statistical properties of the dot position, to our theory."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a Keck spectroscopy and Spitzer Space Telescope analysis of the outer disk of the Triangulum Spiral Galaxy M33. We aim to investigate the disk structure and kinematics, and the properties of the disk star formation. We find that the disk is warped and the warp is almost certainly the result of a density wave created by the massive inner disk. The radially-integrated star formation density is a factor of two higher in the high-density edge of the warp than in the interior of the disk, indicating that the warp triggers additional star formation. We also find a clear signature of the disk accretion shock at the inner boundary of the high-density edge of the warp. Using the Spitzer data we determine the stellar mass of the disk, which is a factor of four lower than found from optical observations. We discuss this in the context of recent results suggesting that the baryonic mass of the disk is a factor of two lower than the stellar mass. We propose that the baryonic mass is dominated by cold gas, which is tightly coupled to the stars. The lower stellar mass could either be due to a lower gas fraction in the outer disk, or to a lower efficiency of the star formation process."}
{"text":"\n\nWe show that a class of superstring isometries, recently proposed by D.FF. integrated with hidden dimensions, can generate a non-Abelian group, in apparent contradiction to the assertations of R. Durgin that superstring isometries must be Abelian. We then show that this result can be obtained by using a simple bijective mapping between the new isometry class and the class of what we call \"full-dimensional superstring isometries\". We show that the new isometry class can be obtained as the coset of a full-dimensional isometry in a suitable quotient group, and that the argument can be easily generalized to show that the full-dimensional isometry class can be realized as a coset of any subgroup of the group of superstring isometries. We also show that the group generated by the new isometry class is isomorphic to the full-dimensional isometry class, and that every element of the new isometry class can be obtained by taking the coset of a suitable element of the full-dimensional isometry class in the quotient group. These results suggest that the new isometry class may be more transparent and more efficiently computable than the full-dimensional isometry class."}
{"text":"\nWe report on a supersoft outburst event in the low-mass X-ray binary 1E0102.2-7219 (rewind) observed with Suzaku between July 18 and 25, 2005. We find that the accretion phase lasted for about 36 ks, during which the source brightness increased by a factor of three. We estimate the mass accretion rate to be \u00a00.36 d\u2057yr\u207b\u00b9, and the energy release to be 4 \u00d7 10\u2076 ergs\u207b\u00b9. The accretion phase is followed by a 19 ks long ejection phase, during which the source brightness decreased by a factor of two. We find that the accretion and ejection phases have a common spectral shape, with a nearly power law continuum and a cutoff emission line. We fit the shape of the continuum with a Band model, and obtain a best fit index of \u22121.45 \u00b1 0.04 and a best fit temperature of 2.0 \u00b1 0.1 kK. The best fit to the shape of the line is obtained with a Natta model, and results in a line center energy of 2.2 kK and a half-width of 0.93 kK. We find that the accretion and ejection phase can be described by the same set of parameters, with a small but non-zero probability. We discuss this result in the framework of the publicly available relativistic viscous disk model (REVISS), and show that it is consistent with a low-pressure-\ufffd configuration, provided that the accretion and ejection events are driven by the same mechanism."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present the results of a systematic search for edge-on disks around brown dwarfs using archival Hubble and Spitzer observations. Our search method uses a combination of silhouette and photometric measurements, which allows the simultaneous detection of disks and the determination of their physical properties. We have found a brown dwarf with a disk that has the unique property of being observed edge-on. This is the first detection of an edge-on disk around a brown dwarf. The brown dwarf is named 2MASS J2126, and it is a member of the TW Hydrae Association. We have determined the physical properties of the disk from our archival observations, which reveal a disk with a mass of gas and dust equal to 2-10x the mass of Jupiter. This makes it one of the most massive disks detected around a brown dwarf. The disk has a radius of 55-70 AU, which is typical of disks around low-mass stars. We have found no evidence that the disk is evolving. Our findings suggest that disks around brown dwarfs are not significantly different from disks around low-mass stars."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present the first search results from the CDF experiment that can be interpreted as the direct observation of a new elementary particle, the top quark.

We observe 2.9sigma evidence for the production of a single top quark in association with a bottom quark and a significance of 1.3sigma for the production of a single top quark in association with a charm quark. The observed single top quark production cross sections are consistent with the Standard Model prediction for a 100 GeV top quark, as is the observed ratio of top quarks produced in association with bottom quarks to top quarks produced in association with charm quarks. We observe a 3sigma excess of events with a charged lepton and an missing energy larger than 20 GeV, which could be due to the production of a top quark and an additional heavy quark.

{"text":"\nWe consider a general class of cosmological models in the presence of corrections proportional to $(1+z)^6$, where $z$ is the scale factor. We show that these corrections are linear combinations of higher-order derivatives of the scale factor. This generalizes the results of previous works in the case $z\\equiv1$. We find that the selection of models with six corrections is much more restrictive than the selection of models with two corrections only. We show that this is due to the fact that the higher-order derivatives become less important as the scale factor grows larger. The model selection problem is therefore much easier in the large-$z$ limit. In this limit, the model selection problem is equivalent to the problem of selecting the Lagrangian density $\\rho=\\rho_{\\rm matter}+\\rho_{\\rm gravity}+\\rho_{\\rm cosmological constant}$. We show that the allowed values of $\\rho$ are much more restrictive in the case with six corrections than in the case with two corrections.

{"text":"\nSemi-empirical pressure-volume-temperature equation of state; MgSiO3 perovskite\n\nWe present a semi-empirical equation of state (EOS) for MgSiO3 perovskite that is valid over a wide range of pressures and temperatures. The EOS is derived from the correlation of several semi-empirical pressure-volume (P-V) data sets and the pressure-temperature (P-T) data of shocks wave experiments. The best fit of the derived EOS to the available P-V data sets is obtained when the thermal expansion coefficient is assumed to be zero. The proposed EOS shows good agreement with the P-T data of shock waves, thereby providing a possible explanation for the observed post-shock compression. The predicted P-V curve for the transition pressure, which is about 8 GPa, shows a large and rapid volume decrease, followed by a high-pressure plateau. We propose that this feature may be related to the structural phase transition from the disordered perovskite to the ordered perovskite. The proposed EOS can be used to constrain the thermodynamic properties of perovskite at high pressures and temperatures."}

{"text":"\n\nWe propose a hybrid model for fusion at deep sub-barrier energies. The model is based on the fractional quantum Hall effect in a semiconductor miniband with a strong spin-orbit interaction and the Aharonov-Bohm effect in a ferromagnetic insulator. The model is derived from a general framework that allows one to study the interplay between various types of ordering, including orbital, spin, and charge ordering, in semiconductor quantum wells. The model predicts a novel type of a symmetry-breaking field, which we call a topological field, in addition to the usual spin and charge fields. The topological field is related to the non-Abelian nature of the Hall effect in a miniband with a strong spin-orbit interaction and has a dependence on the relative position of the Fermi level with respect to the miniband. We show that the topological field can be used to drive a transition between the normal conducting state and a superconducting state with a non-zero threshold field. The model predicts a large variety of non-linear effects that can be probed in a range of experiments."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider quasi-periodic oscillations in a model of charge distribution on a uniformly charged plane, in the presence of a uniform vertical electric field. The solution displays a novel type of limit cycle, which is shown to be stable against changes in the strength of the field, in the range of parameters considered. The quasi-periodic oscillations are associated with a limit-cycle triggered explosion, which in the ideal limit becomes a bolt of lightning of infinite length. In this respect, the present model differs from the classical143 and doughnut44 models oftp-ech discharge. In the limit, the dynamics of the charge distribution becomes the restrictedly three-dimensional elastic vibration of a semi-infinite cylinder of charge, of a mass density depending on the total charge and the square of the field intensity. This limit vibration is shown to conserve energy only if it is an exact integer multiple of the fundamental eigenmode. We show that, if this condition is not fulfilled, the energy of the system decreases with time, eventually leading to the burnout of the charge distribution. We then consider a realistic model of a charge distribution on a plane, in the form of a periodic grating with a small amplitude of vibration. The energy balance is discussed, and the criteria for the burnout of the distribution are derived. The results are consistent with the assumption that the charge distribution is described by the quasi-periodic oscillations, with a frequency close to the resonant frequency of the distribution. We also derive a simple expression for the burnout time, as a function of the initial amplitude of vibration and the field intensity. Finally, we briefly discuss the problem of the stability of the quasi-periodic oscillations."}

{"text":"\nWe present experimental signatures of low energy parity violation (PV) and associated unparticle effects in hadron collisions. We study the evolution of the spatial distribution of hadrons produced in collisions of hadrons with theSavage-Durney (SD) target, in which the weak interaction is turned off. In the limit of small to intermediate impact parameters, the hadron distribution is well described by a linear expansion in the longitudinal direction, with the same power law index for both positive and negative parity collisions. A departure from the linear evolution is observed for large impact parameters, which is consistent with a break-up of the colliding hadron beams into un particles, with a subsequent annihilation of un pairs to hadrons. We also present a signature of un particles in the transverse direction, which is motivated by the possible role of un particles in the production of inclusive direct detection signals in hadron collisions. A model-independent analysis of the transverse distribution of hadrons produced in collisions with the SD target is presented, which demonstrates a clear signature of a threshold transverse momentum (p_T) for the production of hadrons in the collision, with a p_T distribution which is well described by a single power law for both positive and negative parity collisions. The absence of a significant p_T variation as a function of impact parameter suggests that the initial hadron distribution is not strongly affected by unparticle effects.

Our algorithm is based on the solution of the moment equations for the growth rates of the ionized regions, obtained by a kinetic description of the reionization process in terms of a probability distribution function. We find that a simple generalized Wolf criterion for the triggering of new ionized regions is sufficient to reproduce the large-scale structures observed in the inner IGM, provided that the small-scale fluctuations are included in a self-consistent way. Our scheme is robust and efficient, and has a high degree of accuracy. The small-scale fluctuations have a strong impact on the large-scale structure formation, and they induce a significant statistical inhomogeneity in the large-scale distribution of ionized regions. We show that this inhomogeneity can be described in terms of a simple power law, which we use to analyze the large-scale structure in the IGM, and to evaluate the statistical significance of the small-scale fluctuations."}
{"text":"\nWe present here an analysis of our data on the distribution of magnetic fields among A-type stars in open clusters and associations. The analysis includes all clusters and associations for which we have reliable data on the magnetic field of at least 20 A-type stars, a total of nine clusters and three associations. We find that the fraction of A-type stars with magnetic fields in these clusters and associations is similar to that found in Galactic globular clusters, namely about 20 percent. This is in spite of the fact that the clusters and associations contain many more Population I stars than do the globular clusters. This result suggests that the inhibition of the magnetic field generation by the H-R diagram might be less important than previously thought. We also present evidence that the distribution of magnetic field strengths among A-type stars in these clusters and associations is similar to that found in globular clusters, namely, a large fraction of weak fields (B < 10 G), a small fraction of strong fields (B > 50 G), and a peak at intermediate field strengths (10 < B < 50 G). This is in spite of the fact that the clusters and associations contain many more Population I stars than do the globular clusters. We discuss these results in the framework of simple models of magnetic field generation and evolution."}
{"text":"\nWe consider the Extended Hubbard model on a C$_{20}$ molecule, which is a model system for the investigation of the dynamical and geometric properties of the quantum spin-1\/2 alphabet on a chain. We show that the Extended Hubbard model on a C$_{20}$ molecule is equivalent to the Haag-Fock-Brenner model on a C$_{40}$ molecule, in which the two spin-1\/2 sub-chains are combined by a singlet-triplet interaction. In this way we provide a geometrically meaningful basis for the investigation of the Extended Hubbard model on a C$_{20}$ molecule, which allows us to consider the model as a quantum spin-1\/2 alphabet on a chain. We calculate the total Hamiltonian, the single-particle basis, and the two-particle basis of the Extended Hubbard model on a C$_{20}$ molecule. We show that the structure of the two-particle basis is related to the shapes of the singlet and triplet basis functions, and that the basis functions can be chosen in such a way that the model is invariant under a circular permutation of the two spin-1\/2 sub-chains."}
{"text":"\n\nWe investigate the generation of Langmuir turbulence by jet shocks in a closed chamber. Our work is motivated by the fact that many laboratories around the world use radial jet diffusers to generate turbulence in their wind tunnels. We consider a turbulent boundary layer that develops on a flat plate inside a closed chamber where a strong jet blows through a circular orifice in the wall. We use large-eddy simulations to investigate the three-dimensional structure of the flow and find that the dominant turbulence structure is a random field of large vortices. The large-scale structures are robust against changes of the Reynolds number and the orifice diameter. We also perform local analysis of the flow in the boundary layer and find that the small-scale structures are different for different values of the Reynolds number and orifice diameter, which has important implications for the interpretation of wind-tunnel experiments. Finally, we investigate the generation of turbulence by a single strong vortex and find that its structure is different for different Reynolds numbers, which has important implications for the understanding of the transition to turbulence in rivers and the atmosphere."}
{"text":"\nWe have performed a systematic study of the influence of an applied magnetic field on the dynamics of the superconducting phase transition in the thermodynamic $(p, V)$-plane for a wide range of systems, including the high-$T_c$ cuprates, the organic conductors, and the intermediate-T_c superconductors. We find that the dynamics of the transition is characterized by a series of broken lines in the $(p, V)$-plane, along which the transition proceeds in a coherent manner. The lines are related to the band structure of the superconductors, and in particular to the location of the energy gaps. We show that the resistance-temperature curve can be used to infer the location of the coherent lattice vibrations, and we use this technique to study the influence of the electron-phonon coupling on the dynamics of the transition. We find that a moderate increase in the electron-phonon coupling, in a certain range, has the effect of strengthening the superconducting order and making it more stable against thermal fluctuations."}
{"text":"\n\nWe give product formulae for the Ozsvath-Szabo 4-manifold invariants of 3- and 4-dimensional representations of Lie groups. We show that these formulae generalize in an appropriate manner the product formulae ofWCNextTheorem:If $G$ is a locally compact second countable group and $V$ is a finite dimensional representation of $G$ then there is a decomposition $V=\\oplus$ of irreducible representations of $G$. The isomorphism class of $V$ determines an equivalence class of $G$-signed locally compact second countable groups, up to a class of Trivial groups. The decomposition is unique up to equivalence and order. We prove the product formula for the Ozsvath-Szabo invariants of a finite dimensional representation of a locally compact second countable group in the following steps: (1) We give a product formula for the Ozsvath-Szabo 4-manifold invariants of a finite dimensional representation of a locally compact second countable group in the case when the dimension of the representation is $n\\leq 4$. (2) We prove that the product formula for the Ozsvath-Szabo 4-manifold invariants of a finite dimensional representation of a locally compact second countable group in the case when the dimension of the representation is $n\\leq 4$, holds also in the case when the dimension of the representation is $n>4$.

{"text":"\n\nWe present a statistical study of the size distribution of dust particles in the Solar System, based on a data set of 70 collisions reported in the literature. We find that the size distribution is well described by a power law with a positive correlation between the collision energy and the particle size. This is in strong contrast to the expectations from the studies of the disks around young stars, where the size distribution is often found to be cut off by the so-called \"pebbling\" process. We discuss this finding in the framework of a simple model, where we include the major physical processes that are expected to govern the evolution of debris discs: the energy-dependent collisional fragmentation and the stirring of the disc by the planetesimals. We show that the prediction of our model is in good agreement with the size distribution of the 70 collisions, if we assume that the stirring of the disc is efficient and that the mass of planetesimals is small compared to the disc mass. We discuss the consequences of our finding for the discs around young stars."}
{"text":"\nWe present a chemodynamical model of the stellar halo based on the hypothesis that the accretion of metals by giant molecular clouds (GMC) from the ISM has a direct effect on the subsequent star formation in the outer parts of the Galaxy. Our model consists of three main elements: (i) the chemical structure of the ISM, (ii) the dynamical structure of the stellar halo, and (iii) the efficiency of the metal delivery to the GMC. We solve numerically the coupled equations for the chemical and dynamical evolution of the system, in a series of test boxes with different sizes, placed at different radii from the galactic center. We find that the accretion of metals by the GMC from the ISM has a direct and strong effect on the subsequent star formation in the outer parts of the Galaxy, and that this effect is more important in the inner parts of the stellar halo. We also find that this effect is stronger for low-mass stars than for massive stars. Our results suggest that a significant fraction (up to 30%) of the low-mass stars in the stellar halo could have been formed through the accretion of metals by the GMC from the ISM."}
{"text":"\n\nWe investigated the effect of light quanta on the physiological response of Brassica juncea seedlings subjected to Ni(II) stress. Seedlings were treated with different concentrations of Ni(II) and were maintained under three different light treatments: red light (R), far-red light (FR), and blue light (B). We found that R and B light treatments significantly relieved Ni(II)-induced injuries in the shoot and root of B. juncea seedlings. On the other hand, FR light treatment increased the injury symptoms of seedlings treated with Ni(II). These results were further supported by the measurement of photosynthetic performance and the gas exchange rate, which showed that R and B light treatments could attenuate the negative effects of Ni(II) on the photosynthetic performance and gas exchange rate of B. juncea seedlings. We also performed a transient response analysis of Ch1F, which indicated that R and B light treatments could transiently activate the photosynthetic apparatus of B. juncea seedlings. The transient activation of the photosynthetic apparatus by R and B light treatments was accompanied by a transient rise in the cellular pH and turgor pressure. Our results suggest that the light quanta modulated physiological response of B. juncea seedlings subjected to Ni(II) stress, which may be related to the transient activation of the photosynthetic apparatus by R and B light treatments."}
{"text":"\nWe construct a minimal S_3-invariant extension of the Standard Model (SM) which contains only three generations of fermions and two generations of leptons. The extension includes two flavors of quarks and two flavors of charged leptons, with the two light leptons being treated as Dirac fermions with small mass. In addition to the SM fermionic generators, the extension contains a complex structured minimal Lorentz symmetry group which is necessary to explain the small mixing angles of the light leptons as well as the structure of the weak singlet quark. The relevant complex Lorentz structure is derived from an S_3-invariant extension of the Lorentz group. We show that the extra fermionic generators are needed in order to produce an S_3-invariant theory with the two new leptons having Dirac masses which are small but non-zero, while still allowing for an adequate description of the quark and charged lepton masses. We show that the model is fully consistent with the flavor changing neutral currents as well as all the other flavor changing processes which have been observed."}
{"text":"\nWe propose a model of D-brane inflation based on the idea that a D-brane is a boundary of a \"membrane\" that has an interior bulk region, and the bulk region \"warps\" in a manner that is controlled by the three-form curvature. This allows us to formulate the model in terms of an explicit bulk function that describes the warping of the bulk region. This formulation has several advantages. First, the bulk function describes a single, continuous, and explicit function, which can be more intuitive and more tractable analytically than the convention of treating the bulk as a disjoint sum of different bulk regions. Second, this approach is better suited for exploring the connection between D-brane inflation and higher-dimensional bulk inflation. In particular, we show that the bulk function has the structure of a three-form, which relates the D-brane inflation to higher-dimensional bulk inflation. Third, we show that the bulk function is related to the geometry of a D-brane particle, and in particular, to its four- momentum, which allows us to formulate the bulk function as the four-momentum of a D-brane particle. This provides a framework for incorporating the dynamics of D-brane particles into the model. We explore several aspects of the model, including the behavior of the bulk function, the evolution of the D-brane particles, and the interactions of the D-brane particles with each other and with the bulk."}
{"text":"\nWe review recent progress in the theory of periodic holomorphic functions at c=1, due to Abellanas, groom and Bergeron. This theory gives a detailed description of the automorphism group of the elliptic curve $C$ over $\\mathbb C$ with a complete basis of functions of the form $z\\mapsto \\exp(z^2)$, where $z$ runs over the roots of the corresponding polynomial. In the case when the torsion subgroup is trivial, the automorphism group can be described using the Liouville theory of periodic holomorphic functions. The method is based on the construction of an equivalence relation on the set of such functions, by using the uniform limit theorem. The relation defines a quotient group isomorphic to the automorphism group. In this way, the problem is reduced to the study of the action of the automorphism group on the space of Liouville functions. In the case of non-trivial torsion, the construction of the equivalence relation is modified in an essential way. In both cases, the action of the automorphism group is described using the theory of admitting functions."}
{"text":"\nWe present a numerical investigation of the evolution of dust in primordial supernova remnants (PSNRs), a topic which has not been addressed before. We find that the lifetime of dust grains formed in the ejecta of a supernova (SN) is relatively short, on the order of $10^4$ years, because of the rapid evolution of the shock waves in the expanding SN envelope. In addition, the rapid cooling of the SN envelope, on a timescale of about $10^5$ years, will further accelerate the destruction of the grains. Hence, the dust grains are unlikely to survive in the SN ejecta, and even if they do, they will be unable to avoid being injected into the interstellar medium (ISM) at early times. Our results are consistent with the observed abundance of $C_{HI}$ in the ISM, but suggest that the injection of $C_{HI}$ into the ISM may have occurred earlier and in higher concentrations than previously thought. We discuss several physical mechanisms which may have driven the ISM to become metallized at early times, and find that a combination of the effects of supernova (SN) injections and planet formation is most likely to be responsible."}

{"text":"\n\nGrand minima and maxima of solar activity: New observational constraints\n\nWe present observations of solar activity taken with the Solar Optical Telescope (SOT)  on board the Hinode spacecraft during the recent solar maximum  and minimum, and a further minimum and maximum expected in the next solar cycle. We show that during the solar cycle minimum the solar corona is simply elliptically symmetric, with no indication of any large-scale field structures. During the subsequent solar cycle maximum the appearance of the corona changes completely, with the formation of a large-scale field structure in the western half of the solar corona. This large-scale field structure consists of a series of outward discontinuities (fluxtures) in the open solar magnetic field, surrounded by closed field structures, and is consistent with the large-scale structure being due to the emergence of large-scale sunspot groups in the solar photosphere below. We also present observations of the solar activity during a further minimum and maximum in the next solar cycle, which is consistent with the large-scale field structure being due to sunspot activity, and the resulting solar corona being more complex and structured than during the previous solar cycle minimum. We discuss the implications of these results for the triggering of solar activity, and in particular for the occurrence of grand minima and maxima of solar activity."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present an analysis of superradiance and stimulated scattering in SNR 1987A. The spectrum of the optical counterpart of the X-ray flare of 1987 April 27 is described by a power law with a photon index of 1.9 and a normalization of 2.4 kpc$^{-1}$ in the energy range 0.4-1.5 keV. We have derived the three-dimensional distribution of the radio source, which is located at the northern edge of the supernova remnant, to be a \ud8cc\udf211=(6.0 \u00b1 0.3)$ kpc$^{2}$ in extent. We find that this region contains a rather large fraction of the thermal and kinetic energy of the explosion, about $2$ kJ $^{-1}$. This means that a large energy reservoir is available in the interior of this source, which could be the engine that has been driving the X-ray and optical flaring activity. The temperature of the radio source is about $45$ K, which means that there is no strong cooling flow in this region. We discuss two possible physical interpretations of this finding. One is that the bulk of the cooling flow has been taking place in a region that is outside the region we have mapped. The other is that the gas has not been cooling, but has instead been expanding and accelerating. We also discuss a possible connection between superradiance and stimulated scattering in SNR 1987A."}
{"text":"\nWe study the micro- and macrorheological properties of isotropically cross-linked actin networks. Our main results can be summarized as follows. The impact of cross-linking density on the static and dynamic micro-rheological properties is significant. For a given cross-linking density, the addition of salt causes a non-monotonic change in the viscosity and the viscoelasticity. We found that the addition of salt increases the stiffness of the network, while the viscosity decreases. The change in viscosity and in viscoelasticity as a function of the salt concentration has a different behavior for each cross-linking density. At low cross-linking densities, the decrease in viscosity is more significant than the increase in viscoelasticity, while at high cross-linking densities, the increase in viscoelasticity is more significant than the decrease in viscosity. At very high salt concentrations, the viscosity and the viscoelasticity reach a constant value, which depends on the cross-linking density. We found that the structural properties of the networks, such as the radius of gyration and the number and the distribution of gyration modules, are not affected by the salt addition. Finally, we found that the dynamic micro-rheology, characterized by the frequency-dependent viscoelasticity, can be described in terms of a one-dimensional model, in which the relaxation of the net-work tension is described by an exponential law."}
{"text":"\nWe consider a quantum experiment designed to test two non-commuting observables, A and B, for a given state \u03c8. We show that a preparation of the state in a different state \u03c8\u2032 can affect the outcome of the experiment and may lead to an incorrect conclusion about the commutator [A, B] of the two observables. We call this effect state preparation induced tomography failure. We derive a simple inequality that relates the failure probability to the properties of the state \u03c8, \u03c8\u2032, and the experiment. As a simple example, we consider the case of a single qubit in a general state \u03c8 and an unknown state \u03c8\u2033. We show that by performing a quantum process tomography (QPT) measurement, one can certify that the qubit is in a state that is not described by the usual probabilistic theory. If \u03c8\u2033 is a pure state, this result implies that QPT is not a foolproof tool for studying the dynamics of open quantum systems. We also derive a more general result about the failure probability for a larger class of experiments. Our results suggest that one must be careful when applying QPT to study dynamics of open quantum systems."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate photonic-crystal slabs with a triangular lattice of triangular holes. We use a guided-mode expansion method and find that the infinite photonic-crystal slab supports many more guided modes than the infinite photonic-crystal slab with a square lattice of square holes. In particular, there are two types of degenerate guided modes with a total field pattern that is symmetric both spatially and with respect to the photonic-crystal slab's diagonal. One of them has a dark spot at the center of the photonic-crystal slab, while the other one has bright spots at the four corners. The difference between these two modes is that the mode with the dark spot has a local maximum in the gap between the left and right photonic crystals, while the mode with the bright spots has a local minimum there. Both of these guided modes can be obtained by a suitable superposition of the fundamental guided modes supported by the unit cell. We also found that the difference between these two types of degenerate guided modes is related to the fact that the photonic-crystal slab with the triangular lattice has a rotational symmetry, while the photonic-crystal slab with the square lattice does not."}
{"text":"\n\nWe theoretically study the coupling between photonic crystal slabs and embedded quantum wells in a unified framework that combines the principles of quantum theory of optical fields and many-body perturbation theory. The coupling strength is found to be dependent on the inter-subband transition dipole moment as well as the phonon-phonon coupling in the quantum well. We show that the strength of coupling can be enhanced by a factor as large as four by optimization of the device parameters. Our theory also predicts a strong dependence of the coupling strength on the ratio of the slab thickness to the inter-subband transition energy. We show that this ratio can be made large by using a thin quantum well in a thick slab, which can lead to a strong coupling even in the absence of a dipole moment. The theory also predicts a strong blue-shift of the coupled light, which can be utilized to achieve lasing at short wavelengths. We also discuss the limitations of our theory in the strong coupling regime."}
{"text":"\n\nWe demonstrate quantum key distribution (QKD) over a 40 dB channel loss using superconducting single photon detectors (SSPDs). The secret key rate of 100 kbps is achieved for the first time over such a strong loss channel, which is sufficient for most practical quantum communication protocols. The successful transmission over such a high loss is made possible by a new scheme that enables to minimize the photon detection efficiency (PDE) penalty caused by the channel loss. In the scheme, a pulsed laser is used as the light source, and the PDE is increased by detecting the same pulse over multiple passes through the channel. The technique effectively turns the channel loss into a noise, and the signal-to-noise ratio is improved by detecting the pulse multiple times. We successfully demonstrate a secret key rate of 100 kbps using a 40 dB loss channel and SSPDs with a PDE of $7\\%$. The success of the scheme is guaranteed by a theoretical analysis, which shows that the secret key rate does not drop below the physical limit, even if the channel loss is increased."}
{"text":"\n\nWe study the effect of failure on the performance of parallel tasks. We consider the setting of parallel tasks where the tasks are independent on each other, and the setting where the tasks are dependent on each other. We model the effect of failure by assuming that the tasks are independent on each other and each task has an execution time that is exponentially distributed with rate 1. We assume that if a task fails, then it must be re-executed immediately by a single processor. We derive the probability distribution of the total execution time of the tasks. We show that this distribution is expressed in terms of the ratio of the number of processors to the number of tasks. For the case where the tasks are dependent on each other, we show that the derived distribution of the total execution time is still expressed in terms of this ratio. Furthermore, we show that the distribution of the total execution time is the same for the case where the tasks are independent on each other and the case where the tasks are dependent on each other. As an example, we consider the problem of streaming data from a single processor to a set of receivers where the processor and the receivers are connected by independent parallel paths. We show that the distribution of the total execution time, which is the time it takes to transmit the data from the processor to the receivers, is expressed in terms of the ratio of the number of processors to the number of paths. Finally, we consider the problem of scheduling independent tasks on parallel processors such that the total execution time is minimized. We show that the optimal solution to this problem is also expressed in terms of the ratio of the number of processors to the number of tasks."}

{"text":"\n\nWe propose and analyze a lattice Boltzmann scheme for the solution of the compressible Euler equations in a simple geometrically periodic domain. The method is based on the solution of the Boltzmann equation with a stochastic cancellation procedure, which is exact in the limit of a large number of lattice sites. We show that this scheme is unconditionally stable and that it preserves the speed of sound, both of which are important and difficult to achieve in lattice Boltzmann methods for incompressible flows. To achieve these results we develop a new interpretation of the lattice Boltzmann method as a stochastic process with a reservation of the total kinetic energy. This interpretation is different from the standard one based on the Kolmogorov equation, but is more suitable for the analysis of the method and for the understanding of its limitations. This approach also enables us to study the statistical properties of the solution, which are different in the presence of compression. We show that the standard lattice Boltzmann method is not appropriate for high-speed compressible flows, due to the effect of the grid spacing on the speed of sound. Our method is shown to be accurate and stable for a large range of Knudsen numbers, including the limit in which the grid does not affect the solution."}
{"text":"\n\nWe investigated the dynamics of gene frequencies on rugged fitness landscapes using an evolutionary model with explicit representation of phenotypic fitness. We considered the evolution of selfish genotypes, that is, genotypes that have no effect on the fitness of other genotypes. Our results show that rugged fitness landscapes can be stable against invasion of selfish genotypes if the degree of ruggedness is not too large. We found that the invasibility of a population is determined by the relative distribution of fitnesses of the individuals within the population. The higher the relative fitness of the individuals in the population, the easier it is for the population to resist invasion of a selfish genotype. We also found that the population can invade the population of a selfish genotype if the distribution of the fitnesses of the individuals in the population is peaked on the fitness landscape. The probability of this invasion event increases with the sharpness of the peak and the number of individuals in the population. Our results suggest that the invasibility of a population to invasion by a selfish genotype depends only on the global structure of the fitness landscape and not on the particular genotypes that occupy the landscape."}

{"text":"\n\nWe present a scale-dependent galaxy bias model based on the analysis of the galaxy number counts in the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) domain. We show that the galaxy distribution in the FFT space can be well described by a power law with the power law index that varies smoothly from the inner to the outer parts of the Hubble Volume. We find that the bias parameter has a strong correlation with the power law index, which is used to quantify the scale-dependent bias. We demonstrate that our model can quantitatively reproduce the scale-dependent bias observed in galaxy number counts of the same data set used to derive the model. Our model is a generalization of the Schechter function to the FFT domain, and it can be used to describe the galaxy distribution in the FFT space with the linear bias and the scale-dependent bias.

{"text":"\nWe investigate the critical behaviour of irreversible reaction systems. We consider both steady-state and dynamical criticality, and study the relationship between the two. We find that steady-state criticality may be understood in terms of a generalised Nyquist diagram, which we call a criticality diagram.

We call the boundary between the first and second regions the criticity line, and the boundary between the second and third regions the supercriticality line. We find that the criticality diagram can be used to understand the critical behaviour of a wide range of irreversible reaction systems, including systems that have been previously studied using the singularity theory of Cannon and Articles. We also find that the concept of criticality can be extended to discrete-time dynamical systems, and that a criticality diagram can be defined for such systems.

{"text":"\n\nWatermark Embedding and Detection\n\nWe describe a novel scheme for watermarking an image by modifying the least significant bits of selected pixels in the image.

We also present a detection algorithm that uses the least significant bit of the image pixels as a map to the embedded watermark. Our detection algorithm has a small false positive rate and can detect the watermark even if the image has been processed with the same operations that our watermarking scheme is robust to. Our scheme has several advantages over other watermarking schemes. It is simple to implement and does not require a large amount of memory to operate. Our scheme also has the property that the watermark can be extracted at any location in the image.\n\nWe demonstrate the efficacy of our scheme with several examples.

{"text":"\n\nWe are motivated by the recent phenomenon of social and information networks, which has received significant attention from the research community and the industry. In particular, we focus on networks where the links do not have associated weights, and therefore, the graph is said to be unstructured. We study the problem of anonymity on unstructured networks. We define anonymity as the property that, for each link, the removal of that link does not change the number of anonymous nodes. We show that anonymity is a generic property of networks, in the sense that it is preserved by a large class of graph operations. We use this fact to characterize anonymity on unstructured networks. We find that the largest anonymous subgraph has a large number of components, and that the average degree of the nodes in this subgraph is small. We show that this result is tight in a sense that, if we consider a particular class of operations that preserve anonymity, the largest anonymous subgraph has the same number of components and the average degree is the same. We complement our study with an experimental investigation of anonymity on real-world networks."}
{"text":"\nWe have developed a theory of shock-triggered magnetic clouds that explains a wealth of observations on magnetic clouds from many different stars, in particular from massive stars. We find that the fundamental process is the same for all of these clouds: a supersonic stellar wind pushes against a standing shock, and the resulting compression of the magnetic field creates a magnetic cloud. We show that this process is able to produce clouds with a wide range of properties, from very long-lived clouds with many clumps, to very compact clouds with few clumps, to clouds with very small clumps that are difficult to observe. We also show that this theory can explain observations of clouds from low mass stars that were previously thought to be unconnected to massive star clouds. In addition, we find that the theory can explain why some clouds are much brighter than others, even though they contain the same number of clumps. We also show that the theory can explain why some clouds are very compact, and contain many clumps that are close together, while other clouds are very extended, and contain many clumps that are far apart. The theory also explains why clouds are more likely to be found in some parts of the sky than in other parts."}
{"text":"\n\nWe propose a definition of complexity in terms of the concepts of self-organization and emergence as an alternative to more eclectic definitions of complexity that are prevalent in the literature. Our definition encompasses several key attributes of complex systems. In particular, we emphasize the important role of information in the definition of complex systems. We show that a system can be complex in one context and simple in another, and that the complexity of a system can be assessed from the perspective of an observer or an agent. We illustrate the utility of our definition with examples drawn from physics, biology, and computer science, and we show how our definition can be used to identify new examples of complex systems.\n\nThe concept of complexity is not well defined, yet it is widely used in many fields, such as physics, biology, computer science, and the social sciences. In particular, the concepts of self-organization and emergence are often used to characterize complex systems, but there is no consensus about what constitutes a complex system, nor is there agreement about what characteristics of a system make it complex. This paper proposes a definition of complexity in terms of the concepts of self-organization and emergence that encompasses several key attributes of complex systems. We emphasize the important role of information in the definition of complex systems, and we show that a system can be complex in one context and simple in another.

{"text":"\n\nWe consider the possible production of a pair of weakly-interacting massive particles (WIMPs) at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) as a means of probing the neutrino sector. We show that such production is possible with a cross section that is large enough to be detectable above the expected background, provided that the mass of the WIMPs is larger than a few tens of GeV. The corresponding neutrino mass constraints are derived and discussed. In the case that the WIMPs are slightly-interacting massive particles (SIMPs), we show that a LHC search for pair production would be sensitive to the so-called 'Planck scale' of gravity, provided that the SIMP mass is sufficiently large. We also show that LHC searches for pair production of WIMPs and SIMPs could be used to probe the masses of other weakly-interacting particles which have masses smaller than the WIMPs or SIMPs. In this way, a LHC search for pair production could provide a sensitive probe of the entire neutrino sector, as well as the Planck scale of gravity. We discuss the practical aspects of a search for pair production, and we propose a method that uses the distributed computing power of the LHC to search for the corresponding events."}
{"text":"\nWe discuss conservation laws and potential symmetries of linear parabolic equations. Let us consider a linear parabolic equation of the form\n\nu_t + a(t) u_xx = f(t)\n\nin a Banach space X, with a(t) and f(t) being continuous. The motivation for this work is twofold. First, we show that a linear parabolic equation is stable under a transformation if and only if the infinitesimal generator is a linear conserved quantity, in which case the conservation law can be obtained by a straightforward calculation. As a by-product, we give a description of the symmetry properties of the solution in terms of the potential symmetries of the linear parabolic equation. Second, we study the structure of the solution space of a linear parabolic equation with a(t) and f(t) being symmetric. This is motivated by the fact that many interesting examples of linear parabolic equations, such as the heat equation or the wave equation, have symmetric nonlineary and symmetric initial conditions. We show that in general such an equation has a solution space with an internal symmetry. As a by-product, we show that the solution space of a general linear parabolic equation has an internal ecology."}
{"text":"\n\nWe investigate the fractal properties of sets of non-differentiability of Minkowski's ?-function, which is known to be non-analytic and non-smooth in the plane and several complicated fractal properties of this function have been obtained in the past. In this paper, we first prove that the set of non-differentiability of the Minkowski ?-function is itself a fractal set. We show that the fractal dimension of this set is strictly between 2 and 3, which is the first strict evidence showing that the fractal dimension of the set of non-differentiability of a function on the plane has a strictly real value strictly between 2 and 3, without any looseness in the proof. Then we show that the boundary of the fractal set of non-differentiability of the Minkowski ?-function is a fractal set with the fractal dimension strictly between 2 and 3. As a by-product, we show that the boundary of the fractal set of non-differentiability of the function f(x)=x if x is rational and f(x)=0 if x is irrational is a fractal set with the fractal dimension 2."}
{"text":"\nWe present here results of a statistical study of the environments of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) based on a sample of 60 bursts with well-observed afterglows. We have derived the spectral energy distribution of the afterglows, and have analyzed the spectral, spatial, and temporal characteristics of the bursts and their afterglows. We have also estimated the host galaxy magnitudes and distances, and have derived the redshift distribution for our sample. We find that GRBs are a powerful probe of the ISM in galaxies, and can detect gas at high optical depths, far beyond the reach of optical\/NIR observations. Our results suggest that the ISM in galaxies is not homogeneously distributed, but has dense pockets, which are potentially responsible for the energy budgets of individual bursts. We find a significant correlation between the burst duration and the peak fluence, and we discuss this in the framework of the radiative and kinetic energy budgets of GRBs. Our results suggest that the energy budgets of GRBs are potentially very different, depending on the details of the ISM structure in the burst's host galaxy. We also analyze the evolution of the afterglow color as a function of time, and find that the time evolution of the color can be described by a simple model, in which the color is directly proportional to the fluence. We discuss this model in the framework of the different physical processes which may be responsible for the afterglow emission."}
{"text":"\nWe review the physical nature of generic cosmological singularities, with an emphasis on the challenges that their investigation poses to the theory of general relativity, and on the status of their resolution by means of various proposals that have been put forth during the last century. We then focus on the special case of the Big Bang, and on the recent developments in the theory of cosmic inflation that have led to a resolution of some of the puzzles that surrounded the early stages of the universe's evolution. We discuss the idea that the decay of the quantum fluctuations that were generated during inflation may have generated the large-scale structure of the universe, and we examine the singularities that appear in this theory. We then turn to the theory of the early universe as it was developed by Hawking and Penrose, and we discuss the singularity that is predicted to occur at the beginning of time, as well as the ways in which this singularity can be resolved. Finally, we consider the implications of the theory of cosmic inflation for the fate of the universe, and we discuss the possibility that the universe will eventually contract to a singularity, or that it will continue to expand forever."}
{"text":"\n\nAbstract for: Virtual Sensor Based Fault Detection and Classification on a Plasma Etch Reactor\n\nThis paper presents a virtual sensor based fault detection and classification (FDC) framework for a plasma etcher. The motivation for developing this framework is twofold. First, the conventional FDC approaches based on physical sensors are often invasive and may affect the normal operation of the process. In contrast, the virtual sensor based FDC approaches make use of the process models and the readily available chamber data to detect and classify faults, and thus are non-invasive. Second, due to the highly complex and dynamic behavior of the plasma etch process, the conventional FDC approaches often fail to detect faults or misclassify faults when the process is subjected to different recipes or when the recipe changes dynamically. In contrast, the virtual sensor based FDC approaches make use of the dynamic process models which can capture the changes in the process behavior and thus are more reliable in detecting and classifying faults. In this paper, the virtual sensor based FDC framework is developed and validated using the etching data from a dielectric etch process. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework can detect and classify faults with high accuracy."}
{"text":"\nWe consider the properties of the volume operator in loop quantum gravity. We show that the naive definition of the volume operator as the integral of the spatial derivative of the physical field is inconsistent with the definition of the Beltrami-Klippererminde operator in terms of a polar decomposition. We show that this inconsistency can be resolved by introducing a non-trivial constraint operator which is an integral over the spatial derivative of the physical field. The resulting volume operator has a correct Beltrami-Klippererminde decomposition. We show that the non-trivial constraint operator is related to the Gram-Schmidt or Levi-Civita operator, depending on whether the spin connection is introduced as a non-degenerate symmetric two-form or as a general symmetric two-form with a non-trivial symmetric part. This resolves the question of the relative nature of the volume operator in loop quantum gravity, which was previously unresolved. We show that the volume operator in loop quantum gravity is the current volume operator in curved space-time, up to an overall factor which is related to the dimension of the underlying space-time and the signature of the space-time. We show that the constraint operator can be implemented as a symmetry generator, which relates the volume operator in loop quantum gravity to the induced volume operator in effective loop quantum gravity. We show that this symmetry generator can be related to the signature of the space-time. We show that the volume operator in loop quantum gravity is related to the twistor-Weyl volume operator in the sense that their projections onto any space-time-profile-frame are related by a universal constant which does not depend on the choice of the space-time-profile-frame."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider simple shear flow in inelastic Maxwell models. We show that the conventional strain energy function for such models, which is based on the total stress and strain, is not invariant under a constant shear strain. This problem is circumvented by introducing a local constitutive relationship between the shear strain and the shear stress, in addition to the conventional relationship between the stress and strain. The proposed approach is consistent with the local equilibrium principle and with the definition of the constitutive relation in the framework of thermodynamics. We obtain the analytical solution of the proposed model in the limit of small elastic strains. The predictions of the model are compared with the available experimental data for amorphous polymers and amorphous glasses. The model is used to study the role of local inelasticity on the arrest of shear flow. The model predicts the arrest of shear flow at a critical shear strain which depends on the inelasticity. We also show that the model is consistent with the definition of the shear viscosity and with the assumption of small deformations used in the definition."}
{"text":"\nWe consider a pricing problem for a financial instrument whose payoff is a function of the value of the underlying asset. The asset price at the beginning of each period follows a geometric Brownian motion process. We assume that the price at the beginning of each period is a linear function of the price at the end of the previous period. We find that this pricing problem can be solved by using the technique of optimal investment with an unbounded random endowment. In particular, we find that the price of the financial instrument is equal to the optimal investment value, and the optimal investment strategy is independent of the risk-free rate. We show that the optimal investment strategy is a random walk process. We find that this pricing problem has a probabilistic interpretation: the price of the financial instrument is the expectation of the optimal investment value, and the optimal investment strategy is the optimal solution to the random walk process. We show that the optimal investment strategy can be represented by using the technique of utility-based pricing."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a detailed design and implementation of a system for evaluating NAND expressions on flashed-based computers. Our system is based on a new two-level intermediate representation that is tailored to the specificities of flashed-based computers. It uses a very simple stack machine as a low-level intermediate representation that is compiled into a unique high-level intermediate representation that can be further compiled into different final architectures. Our system is the first that is both efficient in terms of execution time and memory usage, while being able to evaluate any NAND expression on a broad range of flashed-based computers. It is at least one order of magnitude faster than previous solutions in all tested configurations, while using at most one order of magnitude more memory. It therefore opens the route to efficient compilation chains that are able to take advantage of all the specificities of different flashed-based computers, something that was not possible with previous solutions."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a comprehensive study of star formation in M33 based on an analysis of the fundamental properties of the star-forming regions. We find that the star-forming regions can be divided into two distinct groups: old and young, which correspond to different epochs of star formation. The old regions are found to have typical properties of fields at local galaxies: they are not very rich in gas and they have low gas surface or volume densities, a small number density of young stellar objects, and a low star formation efficiency. In contrast, the young regions are gas-rich and have high gas surface or volume densities, a large number density of young stellar objects, and a high star formation efficiency. The young regions are also characterized by a strong correlation between the gas surface or volume density and the star formation efficiency. This correlation is not found in the old regions. We also present a simple model to explain the origin of the old and young star-forming regions. We show that such a model is consistent with the properties of the regions and the large-scale distribution of the regions in M33."}
{"text":"\nWe present photometric and spectroscopic observations of the Type Ic supernova (SN 2002ap), made since its discovery in 2002. Our high-resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio spectra show a strong stellar emission line, indicating that the progenitor star is still present. The observations needed to independently verify this interpretation, however, have been made only recently. We show that the observations are consistent with a free-free absorption model with an expansion velocity of 6,000 km s$^{-1}$, and that this model explains the changes in the SN 2002ap spectrum as observed between 2002 and 2014. We show that the un modelling the evolution of the supernova. If the observed progenitor star is a member of the stripped-down stellarator (a stripped-down Wolf-Rayet star), then its initial mass must have been at least $25M_{\\odot}$. If, instead, the progenitor was a massive convective envelope around a neutron star (or black hole), then its initial mass must have been at least $50M_{\\odot}$. We discuss the properties of the stripped-down stellarator, and compare the properties of SNe 2002ap and 2008ha."}
{"text":"\n\nWe relate two standard notions of secrecy for symmetric encryption algorithms. One is the notion of a family of encryption algorithms $\\mathcal{F}$ being (cca) secure, i.e., an encryption algorithm from $\\mathcal{F}$ is secure if any algorithm in $\\mathcal{F}$ is secure. The other notion is the one of (adaptively) chosen-key secure encryption algorithms, which roughly means that for any encryption algorithm $E$ there exists a (black-box) encryption algorithm $A$ such that $E$ is secure if and only if $A$ is secure. We show that if $\\mathcal{F}$ is (cca) secure, then for any encryption algorithm $E$ in $\\mathcal{F}$, there exists an (adaptively) chosen-key secure encryption algorithm $A$ such that $A$ is in $\\mathcal{F}$. We phrase this result in terms of (oca) constructions. We also show that the same result holds if $\\mathcal{F}$ is merely (adaptive) chosen-key secure. As a consequence we obtain that any (cca) secure encryption family contains (adaptive) chosen-key secure encryption algorithms, and that any (adaptive) chosen-key secure encryption family contains (cca) secure encryption algorithms."}
{"text":"\nWe present here results of a systematic study of the diffuse gamma-ray emission produced in cosmic ray (CR) interactions with the interstellar medium, using data acquired with the RXTE satellite. We have found that the spectrum of the diffuse gamma rays is well described by a power law with a photon index of 1 and a cut-off energy of  \u223c 100 keV. We find that the high energy tail of the CR-induced diffuse gamma-ray spectrum is well described by a single power law, with a decay index of 1.1 and a spectral index of 2.3. This result suggests that the CR-induced production of high energy gamma rays is dominated by a single mechanism, most likely due to the interaction of CRs with the local interstellar medium. This conclusion is supported by a comparison of the high energy gamma-ray tail with the high energy tail of the diffuse gamma-ray spectrum measured by the Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft, which is dominated by a different physical process, the interaction of CRs with the diffuse ISM, and has a different spectral and energy distribution. We have found that the total contribution of the CR-induced diffuse gamma-ray emission to the total gamma-ray emission produced in the interstellar medium is  \u223c 5\u201310%. We have found no evidence of a spectral break-up of the high energy gamma-ray tail, indicating that the dominant contribution to the high energy tail is due to a single physical mechanism. The observations suggest that the CR-induced diffuse gamma-ray production is well described by a simple physical model in which the CRs interact with the interstellar medium and produce a power law spectrum with a photon index of 1 and a cut-off energy of 100 keV, while the high energy gamma rays are due to a single physical process and have a decay index of 1.1 and a spectral index of 2.3."}

The motivation for the research is the need for a more efficient and effective way to exchange and share product information within a supply chain context. The key idea is the integration of a PDM and a PLM system to enable the exchange and sharing of product information between different organizations within a supply chain.

{"text":"\nWe present a model for the production of gamma rays in hadronic interactions of cosmic rays (CRs) in the intergalactic medium, based on the combination of the CR hadronization and the hadrotronization processes. This model explains not only the energy distribution of the primary gamma rays produced in the hadrotronization process, but also the relative contribution of the hadronization and hadrotronization processes to the total gamma-ray production, which is in good agreement with observations. The model further predicts that a substantial fraction of the hadrotronization energy deposition occurs at large distances from the hadronization site. As a result, the spectral features produced by the two processes are expected to be significantly different. We show that this hypothesis can explain the peculiar spectral features observed in the energy spectra of the TeV cosmic rays, in particular the \"ankyronic\" shapes of the high-energy parts of the spectrum and the long tail of the low-energy part. We also discuss the hadrotronization contribution to the non-thermal radiation produced by the CR interactions and show that this process is able to account for the non-thermal emission observed in the radio band in CR interactions with molecular clouds."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present high resolution spectroscopy in the mid-infrared (10-15 \u03bcm) of 14 ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) with the Short Wave Infrared Spectrograph (SWIRSpec) on board the James Webb Space Telescope (Webb). We observed the dust emission from the galaxies in the rest frame of each galaxy at the same time as a star in the Milky Way as a reference. We have measured the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the dust emission in these galaxies with an average signal-to-noise ratio of ~5. We find that the dust temperature in these galaxies ranges from 60 K to 120 K. We have derived the mass of the dust in these galaxies from the SEDs using the method ofstacking. We find that the dust masses range from 0.01 to 1.0 Earth masses. We find that the dust-to-stellar mass ratios range from 10^(\u22123) to 10^(+3). Our high resolution spectroscopy reveals the presence of multiple dust clouds in some of the galaxies. We find that the total number of dust clouds in our sample is 11. The most distant dust cloud from the star in our sample is 4.4 kpc. The average dust cloud mass in our sample is 0.38 Earth masses. We have derived the kinematics of the dust clouds using the Kashyap-Rojnal method. We find that the cloud kinematics is chaotic in most of the galaxies. We find that the intrinsic line width of the dust clouds is in the range of 1-5 km s^(\u22121). We find that the minimum distance between two clouds in our sample is 3.5 kpc. We find that the maximum distance between two clouds in our sample is 7.3 kpc. The number density of the dust clouds in our sample is 3.0 \u00d7 10^( \u2212 4) Mpc^( \u2212 3). We find that the total dust mass in the galaxies in our sample is 1.36 \u00d7 10^( \u2212 2) Mpc^( \u2212 3). Our results suggest that the number density of dust clouds in our sample is not sufficient to form a large-scale dust cloud complex like the one in the outer Galaxy. We discuss our results in the context of recent work on the populations of ULIRGs and massive young stellar objects."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a study of the kinematic structure of strong MgII absorbers in the solar photosphere. We use a combination of photospheric magnetic field measurements and spectroscopy of a small-area weakly-magnetized region in the photosphere to show that the kinematic structure of strong MgII absorbers is due to the superposition of three different populations of photospheric granules: (i) fast-moving granules at high latitudes, (ii) slow-moving granules at low latitudes, and (iii) a population of granules with intermediate speeds at all latitudes. We find that each of these three populations has a different velocity structure function (VSF), with the fast-moving granules having a VSF that is characterized by a cut-off at low frequencies and a slow-moving population that has a flat VSF. We show that these two populations can be fit well by power law distributions with different exponents. In contrast, the intermediate-speed population has a VSF that is well described by a single power law with a frequency-independent exponent. We argue that the observed VSFs are consistent with the different populations of granules being subject to different magnetic field strengths, with the fast-moving granules at high latitudes being subject to stronger magnetic fields and the slow-moving granules at low latitudes being subject to weaker magnetic fields. We show that the VSF for the intermediate-speed population can be fit well by a power law with an exponent of \u22121.7, suggesting that this population is subject to intermediate magnetic field strengths. We discuss various physical mechanisms that could give rise to these different populations of granules and find that the most promising mechanism is that the different populations correspond to different temperature structures, with the fast-moving granules at high latitudes being the coolest and the slow-moving granules at low latitudes being the warmest."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a kinematic analysis of 19 ultra-faint Milky Way satellites (galaxies <= 10^5 Lodded), representing the largest sample of satellites observed with high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) data. Our analysis comprises four different galactic orbits, four different galaxy-galaxy separation metrics, and both absolute and relative photometric and kinematic measurements. We find that the satellites are (i) distributed in orbits that are slightly more eccentric than those of the Galactic globular clusters; (ii) more numerous in their pericentric regions than their apocenter; (iii) less likely to have large relative velocities than the globular clusters; and (iv) significantly more likely to be member of a bound system than the globular clusters. The results are consistent with the globular clusters and the ultra-faint satellites belonging to a dynamically driven galactic ecosystem, with the globular clusters corresponding to the most massive and least frequent population. The ultra-faint satellites are more numerous, but also less massive, than the globular clusters, which reflects the fact that they are likely to be the least evolved objects of the galactic globular\/halo system. We also find a strong correlation between the orbital eccentricity and the galaxy-galaxy separation, which implies that the satellites are more likely to be involved in dynamical interactions than the globular clusters. We discuss the implications of our results for the formation and evolution of the Milky Way globular cluster system, as well as for the dynamical structure of the galactic halo."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a method to detect close pairs in galaxy clusters using an adaptation of the separate galaxy-galaxy correlation function (GGCF) technique. We show that the number of close pairs in a cluster is related to the cluster's dynamical state, in particular to the rate of infalling matter and the presence of mergers. We use the estimated close pair number as a proxy for these dynamical phenomena. We find that the estimated close pair number is correlated with the observed radial distribution of galaxies in clusters, the intergalactic medium, and the large-scale structure of the Universe, and we demonstrate that the close pair fraction is predictive of the strength of the cluster's central galaxy. Our results suggest that the number of close pairs is largely driven by the infall of matter and the occurrence of mergers, rather than by the particular choice of the pairs' definition. We find that approximately 1-2% of clusters contain a close pair, and that the percentage is independent of the cluster's richness. We discuss the application of our method to the analysis of clusters in the Universe, and we present a new algorithm to detect close pairs in N-body simulations."}
{"text":"\nWe have carried out a scaling analysis of the distribution of black holes and spheroids in the Cosmic Evolution Survey (CES) at z=0.36, using the Automatically Generated Cosmological Traverse (AGCT) method. We show that the masses of black holes and spheroids are in good agreement with a cosmological model in which the galaxies are taken to evolve from a state of small scale structure at high redshift to a state of large scale structure at low redshift, with a gradual increase of scale in between. We have investigated two different assumptions for the evolution of the number density of black holes and spheroids, and found that the shape of the distribution is consistent with a single power law increasing from high to low redshift, with a small but non-zero value of the power law index. The analysis of the correlation functions shows that the large scale structure in the black hole and spheroid distribution is described by a single power law correlation function, with a value of the power law index that is consistent with the one obtained in the analysis of the mass function. We have also found that the correlation functions of black holes and spheroids are consistent with a simple model in which galaxies evolve from small scale structure to large scale structure, while the distribution of black holes and spheroids in the intergalactic medium remains approximately constant. We discuss the implications of our results for the evolution of the structure of the Universe, and in particular for the problem of the formation of large scale structure."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a simple model of the evolution of Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs) that simultaneously addresses several outstanding issues in the study of this galaxy population, including the question of whether the population is old or young, and the origin of the distinctive morphologies of LRG galaxies. The model consists of a semi-realistic galaxy formation and evolution model coupled with a simple model of LRG formation based on the virialization of massive gas clouds. The model is used to investigate the merging history of LRG galaxies, and in particular, the time since the last major merger. We find that the observed merging timescales are consistent with the predicted merging timescales based on our simple model, except for a few extreme cases. This provides strong evidence that the merging history of LRG galaxies is not different from that of galaxies in general, despite the distinctive morphologies of LRG galaxies. We also use the model to investigate the relation between the mass of the nuclear bulge and the merging timescale, and find that a simple relation is consistent with observations, suggesting that massive nuclear bulges form as a consequence of a major merger. The model has several testable predictions, and suggests several possible ways in which future work can further constrain the merging history of LRG galaxies."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a study of the galactic supernova remnant G299.2-2.9 in X-rays, carried out with the Chandra X-ray Observatory. We find that the remnant has a very simple structure, consisting of a single, symmetrically-shaped, moderately-expanding shell, with a gas temperature of about 1.5 keV, a gas density of  \u223c 0.5 cm\u22123, and a linear shell velocity of  \u223c 20 km s\u22121. No evidence is found for the presence of a central engine. We estimate the mass of the remnant to be  \u223c 2.4 M o. This is consistent with the simple model in which the shell has been expanding isotropically since its formation 4 kpc from the Sun \u223c 5 kyr ago. We find that the chemical composition of the gas in the remnant is significantly different from that of the Sun, with a much higher fraction of He and a lower fraction of heavy elements. The bulk of the remnant lies along the plane of the Galaxy, but its long axis is inclined \u223c 60\u00b0 to the plane, in a direction between the Galactic spiral arms. The mean distance to the remnant is  \u223c 9.5 kpc. We discuss a model in which the supernova that formed the remnant also triggered the collapses of a nearby cluster of massive stars, producing a number of high-mass X-ray binaries. The orbital decay of these X-ray binaries could account for the chemical composition of the remnant gas, and could also account for its observed expansion."}
{"text":"\nWe consider a nonstationary random field, modeled as a wide-band random process with a power-law spectrum, subjected to an integral transform, that maps the field into a new field with a different power-law spectrum. The transform can be viewed as an unstable wave-diffusion process, which allows the investigation of the statistical properties of the nonstationary field in the context of the wave-diffusion theory. The random field is shown to be characterized by a stationary power spectrum, that describes the distribution of its energy, and a nonstationary power spectrum, that describes the statistical properties of its time evolution. We show that the nonstationary power spectrum can be obtained from the stationary power spectrum, by means of a simple relationship, and that it describes a wave-diffusion process with a dynamic coefficient related to the stationary power spectrum. A good characterization of the nonstationary random field is given by the wavespeed, that describes the speed at which the random field propagates, and the width of the random field, that describes the size of the random fluctuations. We show that these parameters can be related to the stationary and nonstationary power spectra by means of a simple formula. The wavespeed and the width of the random field can be used to define a new random field, called the random wavespeed field, that describes the speed and the size of the random fluctuations. The random wavespeed field is characterized by a power-law spectrum, that describes the distribution of its energy, and a nonstationary power spectrum, that describes the statistical properties of its time evolution.

{"text":"\nWe propose a new dark matter (DM) candidate: the Dirac neutrino. The Dirac neutrino has a non-zero mass and a small but non-zero probability of decaying to another neutrino flavor.

We then show that the Dirac neutrino is a compelling explanation for DM in its own right, regardless of the issues with the other DM candidates. The Dirac neutrino avoids the small-scale structure problem because it has a small but non-zero chance of decaying to another neutrino flavor. The Dirac neutrino avoids the baryon number problem because it has a non-zero mass. The Dirac neutrino also explains the reason why the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has not yet observed any new particles, while the highly-sensitive neutrino experiments have observed several new neutrino flavors. The LHC and the neutrino experiments are both looking for particles that could be DM candidates. We show that the LHC and the neutrino experiments are not looking for the same type of DM candidate, so it is not surprising that the LHC has not observed any new particles while the neutrino experiments have observed several new neutrino flavors. The LHC is looking for a new particle that would be a strong DM candidate, while the neutrino experiments are looking for a new neutrino flavor that would be a weak DM candidate."}
{"text":"\nWe present observations of the unique galaxies Ghostly Perspective and Psychological, found in the COSMOS survey at z=0.6. These galaxies contain an excess of radio sources, indicating a large number of supernovae (SNe) in their past. Using the Australian Telescope, we have imaged the gas and stars in these galaxies, finding that the gas is moving at unprecedented speeds of up to 1000 km\/s, much faster than the stars. We show that the gas in these galaxies has been ripped out of them by the SNe, and is moving so fast because the galaxies have been heavily distorted by their past star-formation and the infall of intergalactic gas. We calculate that the gas has been accelerated to these extreme speeds by a powerful torque, caused by the infall of gas and the strong local intergalactic magnetic field. This is the first time that such fast outflows have been discovered in massive galaxies at high-redshift. This discovery changes our understanding of how galaxies evolve at high-redshift, and provides a possible explanation for the unusual features of massive galaxies in the distant Universe."}
{"text":"\n\nAbstract.\nIn this work, we propose a new compressed regression model, which is a generalization of the classical least squares regression to the case in which the number of variables is much larger than the number of samples. The main idea is to exploit the fact that, in many applications, only a few of the variables are relevant, while the others are irrelevant. We show that in this case the dimension of the projection of the data onto the subspace spanned by the few relevant variables is much smaller than the dimension of the full data space, and we develop a regression method which takes advantage of this property. Our approach is motivated by the problem of model selection, and in particular by the problem of selecting the variables which are most relevant for the prediction of a response variable. We develop a series of theoretical results which guarantee the convergence of the proposed method, and we provide an interpretation of the model in terms of a sparse representation of the data. Finally, we present an application to a real-world problem, which shows the potential of the method."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a detailed study of the enigmatic cluster M82F using a combination of high-resolution near-infrared spectroscopy, high-resolution optical spectroscopy, and multi-object optical\/NIR imaging. We find that the cluster consists of two distinct groups of galaxies, which we term the North and South components. The North component contains a small number of bright galaxies, which are member galaxies of the Local Volume Subcluster, and a much larger number of faint galaxies, which form the majority of the M82F cluster. The South component consists of a relatively small number of bright galaxies which are probably member galaxies of the Comiccio- burial Subcluster and a much larger number of faint galaxies which are a minority population in the M82F cluster. We show that the M82F cluster is a member of the Fornax-Righarthed galaxy cluster system, and we determine the redshift of the M82F cluster to be z ~ 1.225. We discuss the dynamical state of the cluster and the physical properties of the galaxies in the context of the dominant galaxy formation theory."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present new results of a systematic study of large-scale structure of the Universe, based on the analysis of the cosmic microwave background radiation and large galaxy redshift surveys. Our analysis indicates that the transition from a decelerating to an accelerating universe occurred at an early stage of cosmic history, most likely between 7 and 10 billion years ago. We find that the local galaxy density is above the critical density for a flat Universe, and the local growth rate is below the critical rate for a decelerating Universe, both with a significance of about 5\u03c3. Hence, the large-scale structure of the Universe is in a state consistent with a dynamically arrested Universe, with a confidence level of about 95%. This conflicts with the hypothesis of a universe dominated by a cosmic repulsion, which should manifest itself on the largest scales by a preference for voids over high density regions. The early transition to a state of accelerating expansion challenges our current understanding of the evolution of the Universe, and suggests that a detailed analysis of the large-scale structure may be a powerful probe of fundamental physics."}
{"text":"\nWe present new near-infrared observations of the Z < 8 galaxy cluster 3C 48. The data were obtained with Subaru\/SuprimeCam, Subaru\/SuprimeCamPlus, Subaru\/HiLLS, and KeckII\/DEIMOS, and are used to study the source subtracted near-infrared properties of 3C 48. We find that the colors of the main galaxy population in 3C 48 are well described by a power law with a slope of -1.2 \u00b1 0.2 and an intercept of 1.06 \u00b1 0.14. This result is consistent with the colors of galaxies in clusters with a low galaxy redness\u2013housing ratio, and thus a low tendency to form spiral galaxies, and suggests that the main galaxy population in 3C 48 has a very blue tint. We conclude that the main source of the spiral galaxies in 3C 48 is a satellite galaxy population with a distinct color distribution. The color distribution of the spiral galaxies in 3C 48 is well described by a single power law with a slope of -0.83 \u00b1 0.03 and an intercept of 1.58 \u00b1 0.12. We find that the color distribution of the spirals in 3C 48 is well described by a simple model in which the galaxy formation process is treated as a competition between the main galaxy population and the spiral galaxy population, where the main population is characterized by the power law described above. This model provides a physical interpretation of the color distribution of the spiral galaxies in terms of the dynamical state of the cluster and suggests that the mechanism responsible for the formation of spiral galaxies is present in clusters with low galaxy redness\u2013housing ratios."}
{"text":"\n\nWe investigate the polarizabilities of intermediate-sized lithium clusters from density-functional theory (DFT). We calculate the polarizabilities of the ground state as well as several excited states for Li_{n} and Li_{n+1} clusters (n = 2-12). We find that the polarizability of the ground state increases with the cluster size, in good agreement with previous theoretical and experimental results. The most significant contribution to the polarizability comes from the outermost shell. In contrast to the small lithium clusters, the polarizability of the excited states decreases with the increasing cluster size. We explain this behavior by the difference of the distribution of the electronic charge between the ground state and the excited states. Our results are consistent with the findings in the small lithium clusters, where the charge is more concentrated in the outermost shell in the excited states than in the ground state. We also calculate the first few terms of the auto-correlation function (ACF) for the ground state and the first two excited states for several clusters. The differences in the ACF between the ground state and the excited states are consistent with the changes in the polarizability."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a new method for modeling novae explosions based on a systematic variation of the reaction rate coefficients. We show that the explosion height and the corresponding energy can be described well by two distinct reaction rate regimes. In a parameter range where the difference in the rate coefficients is large compared to the mean reaction rate, the energy release is controlled by a single reaction path. Outside this range, the energy release is governed by the sum of the contributions from many parallel reaction paths. Our results are consistent with a semidetached model in which the energy release is controlled by the strong dependence of the reaction rate on the number density.\n\nWe analyze the influence of the new rate coefficients on the evolution of a nova simulation. The basic properties of the system, such as the initial mass and the core mass, have only a minor effect on the outcome of the explosion. Instead, the main factor is the level of Underlind reaction rate coefficients. We show that a nova simulation can be evolved until it reaches a point where the reaction rate coefficients have the same level as in the observation. At this point, the simulation and the observation can be compared directly. We discuss the effects of non-equlibrium reactions and the influence of the chemical composition on the explosion.\n\nOur results suggest that the level of the Underlind reaction rate coefficients is an important parameter to constrain when analyzing observations of novae explosions."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present photometric observations of the optically dark Gamma Ray Burst (GRB) 051028, which occurred in March 2005. We find that the burst had a complex optical structure, containing several bright knots and a fainter, smoother component. We determine the times of outbursts from the bright knots and the evolution of the smooth component. We model the bursts with a pseudo- Ranaevilitec structure in which the knots are produced by the interaction of the burst with clouds. We estimate the total energy deposition from the burst in the clouds to be  \u223c 100 kJ, in agreement with earlier estimates based on observations of the thermal emission. The estimated optical depth of the clouds is log(\u03a6\/\u03a60) \u223c -0.6, where \u03a6 is the deposited energy and \u03a60 is the energy that would be deposited by a burst with the same energy distribution but passing through a cloudless medium. This suggests that the burst experienced significant absorption and scattering by the clouds, and that the energy distribution was hard to soft, with a peak at  \u223c 100 keV. We discuss possible mechanisms for the production of the burst, and the implications of our results for the study of GRBs and the composition of the circumburst medium."}
{"text":"\nWe study the interplay between thermal percolation and jamming upon dimer adsorption on binary alloys. We consider a two-dimensional (2D) suspension of hard disk-shaped particles with a small attractive interaction between the adsorbates and the substrate. We find that the coverage-dependent transition temperature between the disordered liquid-like and the ordered solid-like phases is modified by the shape of the adsorbates. For a dimer with a strong preference for a particular orientation, the transition temperature is increased by a strong surface roughness, but it is decreased by a weak one. For a dimer with a weak preference for a particular orientation, the transition temperature is increased by both strong and weak surface roughness. We explain the results by a careful analysis of the corresponding percolation models. Our work suggests that the preference of a given adsorbate for a particular orientation is important in determining the nature of the disordered phase below the glass transition temperature."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present the latest catalog of weak-line T Tauri stars (WTS) from the Spitzer c2d Survey. We find a total of 1251 WTS in the Survey area, 949 of which are new discoveries. We determine the radii of the disks for all the WTS in the catalog, and find that the median disk radius is 2.56 pc. The derived disk masses are in good agreement with the masses found in the literature for similar stars. We find a correlation between the disk radius and the disk mass, which we use to derive the relation between the two quantities. We find that the variation in the disk mass is large, even for stars with disks of similar radii. The observed correlation between disk radius and disk mass is likely to be a selection effect, with the more massive disks being larger simply because they are more evolved. We find that about half of the disks in the Survey are massive enough to have achieved the Roche limit, and that a large fraction of massive disks are likely to have evolved into close-in Jupiters. We discuss the implications of our findings for planet formation models."}

These stars are both members of the young open cluster Collinder 91. 7 Aql is a well-known Delta Scuti star, while 8 Aql has been suspected of being a member of the same class of variables. Our observations were made with the 1.5-m telescope at CKO value, the 1.0-m telescope at Boyden Station (Australia), and the 0.57-m telescope at Fairborn Observatory (Canada) during the period from December 2002 to March 2003. We obtained a total of 78 photometric observations of 7 Aql and 51 observations of 8 Aql. We find that 8 Aql is indeed a Delta Scuti star, although it spends much more time at minimum light than at maximum light, and therefore has a very different behaviour from 7 Aql. We determine the periods of both stars, as well as the amplitudes and phases of 8 Aql. We discuss these results in the context of other Delta Scuti stars in young open clusters."}

The geometric structure also provides a natural generalization of the concept of independence and allows us to define generalized forms of statistical independence and dependent structures. As an application, we consider a model for random data that has a dependent structure and show that this model can be considered as a generalization of the normal distribution.

{"text":"\n\nWe present the first stellar cluster found in a host galaxy beyond our own, the spiral galaxy NGC 346. We find the cluster to be composed of mainly blue stars, with a lower metal content and a larger proportion of young stars than the solar neighborhood. The cluster is located in the galactic disk, 17 kpc from the center of NGC 346, and has a radius of 6 arcmin, containing a total of 12 Gyr of orbital motion. We estimate the cluster to contain about 5,000 M sun of gas and 100,000 M sun of dust, with the dust being concentrated in a few clumps. The cluster contains many young stars, some of which are in the process of forming. We find that the stars in the cluster have a much smaller velocity dispersion than those in the solar neighborhood. A total of 48 proper motions were measured, the largest of which is 57 km s-1. This is much smaller than the velocity dispersions of clusters in the solar neighborhood, such as Pir reciprocals, and in galaxies closer to us, such as the cluster in M31. The cluster contains a number of blue giants and a very large number of low-mass stars. The metallicity of the cluster is somewhat lower than the solar value, but there is no clear trend in the metallicity distribution function. The age of the cluster is not well defined, but we estimate it to be at least several hundred million years. The cluster has a small peculiar motion with respect to the host galaxy, of 3.5 kpc x 3.5 kpc, and is not obviously part of a large-scale structure. The main problem in finding such clusters beyond the solar neighborhood has been the overwhelming glare of the host galaxy, which makes it difficult to detect the much fainter cluster stars. We have used image subtraction of two digital images obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope, and star counts in small fractions of the field to identify the cluster."}
{"text":"\nWe consider an expansion for self-interacting random walks. The expansion is in terms of the probability of large deviations from the mean.

{"text":"\nWe investigate the phase behavior of a fluid that has competing attractive and repulsive interactions. We find that the coexistence region of the fluid is a line, and that the line is either horizontal or has a negative slope depending on the competition strength. When the competition strength is large, the fluid has a stable structure that is periodically distorted by thermal fluctuations. We study the statistical properties of the fluid in the presence of an external field, which is modeled by a delta-pinning in a tilted field. The direction of the field is such that the fluid is in the same phase over the entire domain, but is under stress. We show that this stress is relieved by the creation of a line of defects, which separates the fluid into two phases. We also find that the defect line can move due to thermal fluctuations, and can either become stable or disappear, depending on the competition strength and the position of the defect line. Our results suggest that line defects can be formed by thermal fluctuations in a fluid with competing interactions, and that the defects can become stable if the stress in the fluid is relieved."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a simple, general method for finding the optimal window for detecting a point source in a spherical harmonic decomposition of a galaxy, as well as the corresponding optimal two-point function window. The method is applied to the problem of detecting the 2MASS dipole in the Galactic potential, using the Cl(...)20mg photographic survey. The analysis is performed in the basis set of the density field, using theKick (!) aperture to determine the optimal detection window. We find that the optimal window is sensitive to the radial aperture, but relatively insensitive to the angular aperture. The optimal window is quite large, and can be approximated by a single shell around the true dipole, with a width of about 60 degrees. We find that a good approximation to the optimal window can be found by assuming that the magnitude of the source is proportional to the local galaxy density, and that the detectability is inversely proportional to the square of the local galaxy density. We show that this approximation is accurate to within a few percent for detectabilities above 4sigma. The optimal window for the two-point function is found by a similar method, and we find that the optimal separation for the 2MASS-redshift experiment is about 1 kpc, independent of the radial aperture used to extract the spherical harmonic decomposition."}

{"text":"\nWe study the statistical mechanics of the three-dimensional random field Ising model. The model is exactly solvable, but the solution has a non-trivial structure, which reflects the special features of the transition to the Ising phase. We show that this solution can be obtained by a thermodynamic limit of a two-dimensional model with an exactly known solution. The transition to the Ising phase is characterized by a corner flow, which is related to a flow in the internal degrees of freedom of the Ising spins. This flow has a nature similar to the flow in the two-dimensional XY model, but it is more complicated, because of the three-dimensional structure of the interactions. The possible types of the phase transition are classified and the conditions for their appearance are derived. In particular, a phase transition to the Ising phase from a non-magnetic state is possible only if the Ising spins are in a (degenerate) helical state. On the other hand, a phase transition from the Ising phase to a non-magnetic state can have several different types, depending on the structure of the non-magnetic state. We also discuss the statistical mechanics of the random field Ising model in a general symmetric under the Ising transformation glass."}

{"text":"\nWe study the problem of information diffusion in social networks. We define an information diffusion epidemic as a rapid and extensive propagation of information in a social network. We identify three basic mechanisms for the diffusion of information: local updating, global updating, and error propagation. We study the effect of these mechanisms on the speed of information diffusion and on the spatial and temporal patterns of diffusion. In particular, we show that the speed of information diffusion increases with the density of the social network, but it decreases with the degree of the social network. We find that the local updating mechanism is the most important one in small social networks, while the global updating mechanism is the most important one in large social networks. We also study the spatial and temporal patterns of information diffusion, and we find that they can be explained by a simple model based on the Hopfield model. Finally, we present a simple model of information diffusion that is consistent with the main results of our study."}
{"text":"\n\nWe study cooperation in the spatial Prisoner's Dilemma. We develop a reward mechanism that rewards cooperation and punishes defection in the spatial Prisoner's Dilemma. In our model, a strategy's reward depends not only on its own history of cooperation, but also on the history of cooperation of other strategies in the same neighborhood. We show that this reward mechanism promotes cooperation in the spatial Prisoner's Dilemma. We find that the emergence of cooperation is related to the initial configuration of the strategies. In particular, if the initial configuration of strategies is sufficiently clustered, cooperation emerges in all regions. We also find that cooperation is more resilient in the spatial Prisoner's Dilemma than in the standard Prisoner's Dilemma. In particular, once cooperation emerges in a region, it is more difficult to reverse this cooperation. We discuss the implications of our findings for the emergence and resilience of cooperation, and for the effect of spatial structure on social dynamics."}
{"text":"\nWe consider a spherically symmetric problem on the brane and galactic rotation curves.

{"text":"\nWe present a comprehensive study of the phenomenology of supersymmetric (SUSY) models in light of the latest high-energy physics observations and precision electroweak data. The motivation for this work is the observation that SUSY model builders have been toooften guided by their theoretical prejudices rather than by the data. After reviewing the basics of SUSY theory and its implications for standard model (SM) physics, we evaluate the most direct SUSY predictions in light of recent and upcoming SM observations. We then present an overview of the current state of the art in SUSY model building, with a focus on those models which are most compatible with the data, and we analyze their phenomenology in detail. We find that while many of the SUSY models which are currently being advocated are capable of producing the standard model's data, there is no clear preference for any particular model. We also evaluate the implications of the latest SM observations for the basic SUSY theory and the simplest SUSY models, and we suggest how future observations may help to discriminate between the various SUSY models which are under consideration."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a study of very high redshift Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) detected by the Swift satellite. We find a population of bursts with very high redshift (z > 6), well separated from the well-studied low and intermediate redshift populations, and with unique properties. These bursts are found in galaxies with high redshift, relatively high gas content, and relatively low star formation rate, suggesting that the bursts are a powerful sink of gas at these galaxies. The main hypothesis we explore is that these bursts are produced in the centres of galaxies, in massive black holes (BBHs), and that they are able to grow and produce huge amounts of gas, because they are still accreting matter at these high redshifts. The large amounts of gas they produce could explain the large amounts of gas observed in the galaxies. We find that the physical properties of these bursts are consistent with this hypothesis, and also with the hypothesis that they are produced in galaxies with strong winds from starbursts. We also show that the GRBs in this population have much higher energy than the low and intermediate redshift bursts. We suggest that the very high redshift GRBs could be an important source of gas for the galaxies, and could have a large impact on their evolution."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a catalog of ionized nebulae around bright galaxies in clusters. Our sample consists of 52 galaxies in 29 clusters selected from the red sequence of clusters in the 2 Micron All Sky Survey. We use thecluster\/field galaxy number ratio as a criterion for cluster membership. We find 6 ionized nebulae around these cluster galaxies, 5 of which are new discoveries. These ionized nebulae are associated with 3 of the 52 cluster galaxies (62%) and all are within 3 effective radii of the cluster centers. We have derived the physical properties of these nebulae, such as size, temperature, and ionization state. The average ionization age is 2.6 kpc and the average temperature is log(T\/K) = 6.38. The smallest ionized nebula has a radius of 1.5 kpc and is located 1.6 kpc from the cluster center. The largest nebula has a radius of 7.4 kpc and is located 6.4 kpc from the cluster center. The mean metallicity of the gas in the ionized nebulae is 12 +log(O\/H) = 7.06, which is significantly higher than the gas in the clusters (12 +log(O\/H) = 7.00). We also present multi-wavelength images of these nebulae. We have found that the ionized nebulae in our sample have an average star formation rate (SFR) of 1.36 Msun yr-1, which is 1.67 times higher than the average SFR of the cluster galaxies (0.83 Msun yr-1). This result suggests that the ionized nebulae are sites of intense star formation and are associated with the brightest cluster galaxies."}

{"text":"\n\nWe present a detailed study of the evolution of the optical afterglow of Swift GRB 050802, a nearby gamma-ray burst (GRB) which was observed by the Swift satellite, as well as by several optical telescopes. The afterglow emission is found to be composed of two components with different properties, which we identify as the jet's fade-out and the radioactive afterglow of the burst's expanding bubble. The evolution of the jet's optical emission is well described by a power law with a 3.4 kpc coma scale, and its decay fits well a $\\mathrm{1\/t}$ law with a decay index of 1.2. The radioactive afterglow, in contrast, evolves differently, with a power law index of -1.7 and a different 1\/t decay index of 2.3. We estimate the energy fluence of the radioactive afterglow to be 3.1 kJ m-2. We find that the optical afterglow emission of GRB 050802 has a higher energy fluence than previously observed optical afterglows of nearby (5-100 kpc) GRBs, but is of the same order of magnitude as the optical afterglow of the distant (300-1500 kpc) GRB 030329. We discuss this in the framework of simple models for the optical afterglow, including a model in which the optical afterglow emission is the sum of the jet's fade-out and the radioactive afterglow. We find that, given the observed correlation between the jet's power law index and the optical\/NIR afterglow's energy fluence, a model in which the jet's fade-out is the dominant contribution to the optical\/NIR afterglow emission provides a good fit to the data, in the framework of the distance-from-bursts-to- observer binning that we use."}
{"text":"\nWe study the structure and dynamics of surface waves and related instabilities in dissipative rotating superfluid neutron stars. We consider both the hydrodynamic and the full-f fluid equations in the limit of small amplitude waves, and we analyze the different types of instabilities that may be excited by a small perturbation of the mean flow. We find that the fast waves ( whose speed of propagation is much larger than the inverse of the frequency) are very sensitive to the rotation of the star: they either break down into a large number of small waves or evolve into steady, large-scale waves with a frequency proportional to the rotation frequency. The slow waves ( whose speed of propagation is much smaller than the inverse of the frequency), on the other hand, are very stable against the presence of a rotating background, and they may be used to probe the interior of the star. We discuss the physical origins of our findings and we suggest that the slow waves may be used to probe the properties of the superfluid core of rotating neutron stars."}
{"text":"\n\nWe introduce a family of norms on the space of continuous paths on a simple algebraic variety that generalizes both the Lebesgue and Thurston norms. We show that these norms are equivalent to asking that a function be the restriction to a normal surface of a certain function on the Variety. As an application, we give an example of a function that is continuous on a non- normalize algebraic surface but is not the restriction of a continuous function on the variety."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider the problem of estimating a continuous field variable using randomly deployed, noisy, binary sensors. The deployment of the sensors is assumed to be random in the sense that the locations of the sensors are independently and uniformly distributed on a given grid. The measurements made by the sensors are binary in the sense that each sensor is either \"on\" or \"off,\" and the on\/off probability is independent of the other sensors. The measurements are also noisy in the sense that the on\/off probability is unknown and assumed to be drawn from some probability distribution. The goal is to estimate the field variable at the location of each sensor using the on\/off measurements of the sensors in the neighborhood of that location. We assume that the field variable has a smooth enough probability distribution, and that the effect of the noise is local in the sense that the noise affects the estimate of the field variable at each location independently. We propose a new algorithm for estimating the field variable at each location based on the ideas of maximum likelihood estimation and the binary decision tree algorithm. The proposed algorithm is simple and has a clear probabilistic interpretation. We show that the proposed algorithm is robust to the random deployment of the sensors and to the noisy nature of the measurements, and we evaluate the algorithm using simulation studies."}
{"text":"\n\nWe show that the time-evolution of a liquid-crystal (LC) domain can be controlled by applying a shear field to the LC on a periodically corrugated substrate. We report a fast and reversible tuning of the LC alignment, enabling the control of the orientation and the phase-separation of the LC. The coupling between the LC and the shear field is achieved by the alignsymmetric Coraline Doleum, a chiral molecule with a branched structure. The shear field induces a disclination line, and the coraline molecules are oriented along this line. The disclination line acts as a boundary of the LC phase, and the resulting phase-separation pattern is controlled by the shear field. We found that the application of a shear field to a LC on a periodically corrugated substrate, a so-called Liesegang experiment, allows to control the time-evolution of the LC domain. The Liesegang experiment is especially interesting for applications in optical and optoelectronic devices, since it enables the fast and reversible tuning of the LC alignment."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider the stress-energy tensor of a sixth-order theory of gravity in a general metric background. This tensor is decomposed into irreducible forms with respect to a proper modification of the ten-dimensional space-time. The variation of the action terms of the theory are calculated with respect to the nine independent components of the metric and the constraint term is then obtained by using the linear transformation properties of the irreducible tensor components. In the approximation in which the constraint term is ignored, the resulting theory is able to describe the symmetric and asymmetric variations of the stress-energy tensor. We show that the approximation of the stress-energy tensor by the irreducible forms can be used to reduce the dimension of the space-time by two, in a way similar to the well-known SPT approximation in general relativity, in which the ten-dimensional space-time is reduced to eight dimensions by using the symmetric and anti-symmetric parts of the stress-energy tensor. The approximation can be further simplified by using the symmetries of the problem, in a way similar to the SPT approximation."}
{"text":"\n\nCulminating paths\n\nWe present a new approach to the problem of computing the shortest paths between two points on a grid, which is motivated by the need to solve this problem for large graphs on large grids. We show that if the underlying graph is a tree, then one can preprocess the graph in order to find a vector of shortest path lengths between every pair of points. This vector is indexed by the two points, and is of size n\u00d7n, where n is the number of points on the grid. Given two points p and q, one can then find the shortest path between p and q by simply taking the minimum over i and j of the elements of the vector. For more general graphs, the preprocessing step is more involved, but it is still possible to compute a vector of shortest path lengths in this way. We show that this algorithm is much more efficient than the naive algorithm of computing the shortest path for every pair of points.\n\nOur work differs from previous work on this problem in several ways. First, we give a more general algorithm that is applicable to a wider class of inputs. In particular, our algorithm is guaranteed to work on graphs that are not tree-like. Also, previous work on this problem was restricted to square grids, while our algorithm is applicable to general rectilinear grids. Finally, our algorithm has a much better worst-case running time. In particular, we show that if the underlying graph is a tree, then our algorithm runs in O(n2log n) time, where n is the number of points on the grid. For more general graphs, the running time is still polynomial in n."}
{"text":"\n\nWe investigate the statistics of the evolution of quantum states which are initially occupied by several entangled particles, but not in a pure state. For a large class of such states, a precise analytical formula for the evolution is derived, in the framework of Gaussian perturbation theory. The resulting evolution is found to be well described by a generalized outline of the Landau-Ginzburg- Wilson (LGW) theory. In particular, a parameter related to the violation of the Bell inequality and a parameter related to the fidelity of the evolution are introduced. Our results show that the evolution is mostly governed by the former parameter, in a way which is very similar to the well-known LGW evolution in pure states. However, we also find a strong dependence on the latter parameter, which leads to a number of surprising effects, some of which can be exploited for quantum information processing. Our results also imply a general method for finding simplified models which describe the evolution of mixed states well, for a large class of mixed states."}
{"text":"\nWe study the effects of thermal fluctuations on the nuclear symmetry energy with a momentum-dependent effective interaction. The motivation for our work is to investigate the mechanisms of the enhancement of the symmetry energy due to the inclusion of the thermal-fluctuation-induced non-equilibrium effects in the effective interaction, which has not been considered previously. Our key idea is to employ the dynamic mean-field theory to evaluate the non-equilibrium corrections to the effective interaction at finite temperature. Our methodology is to first derive the effective interaction at the fixed temperature and then evaluate the thermal-fluctuation-induced non-equilibrium corrections to the effective interaction. Our results show that the non-equilibrium corrections can be sizable and have the opposite sign to the usual second-order correction, i.e., the non-equilibrium correction can lead to the enhancement of the symmetry energy at finite temperature. We also show that the non-equilibrium correction to the effective interaction depends sensitively on the system size and the temperature. Our results may have important practical and theoretical implications for the design of quantum many-body systems at finite temperature, in which one can enhance the symmetry energy by using a non-equilibrium effective interaction."}
{"text":"\nWe consider a model of the structure of space-time, which combines the principles of Einstein's theory of General Relativity and a Lorentzian aether. Within this model we investigate the strong field effects on binary systems. The aether part of the model is described by a vector potential field $A^\\mu$, which is related to the gravity field $G^{\\mu\\nu}$ by the following symmetric and antisymmetric combinations: $A^\\mu = \\epsilon^\\mu \\, G^\\mu \\, \\epsilon^\\nu \\, G^\\nu$, $A^\\mu = -\\epsilon^\\mu \\, G^\\mu \\, \\epsilon^\\nu \\, G^\\nu$, where $\\epsilon^\\mu$ is the completely antisymmetric tensor, and $G^\\mu\\nu$ is the symmetric tensor which comes from the Levi-Civita connection on the aether. In the strong field approximation the vector potential $A^\\mu$ can be expanded in the basis of the orthonormal functions $\\epsilon^\\mu$, $\\epsilon^\\mu$ and $\\epsilon^\\mu \\, G^\\mu$, $\\epsilon^\\mu \\, G^\\mu \\, \\epsilon^\\nu$, $\\epsilon^\\mu \\, G^\\mu \\, \\epsilon^\\nu \\, G^\\nu$. The leading term in this expansion is the minimum-action principle for the aether. The second term in the expansion is the only one which is Lorentz-invariant, i.e. which does not change with the choice of the origin of aether. This term is related to the trace of the aether-ether field $\\epsilon^\\mu \\, \\epsilon^\\nu$ in the symmetric density matrix $G^\\mu\\nu$ of the aether. The last two terms in the expansion are related to the non-decaying or self-sustained solitons.\nThe main result of this work is the formula for the full energy-momentum tensor $T^\\mu_\\nu$ of the self-sustained solitons in terms of the energy-momentum tensor $G^\\mu_\\nu$ of the aether and the symmetric density matrix $\\epsilon^\\mu \\, \\epsilon^\\nu$ of the antisymmetric tensor $\\epsilon^\\mu$. The energy-momentum tensor $T^\\mu_\\nu$ is related to the structure of the symmetric density matrix $\\epsilon^\\mu \\, \\epsilon^\\nu$. As the particular example we consider the spherical self-sustained solitons."}

{"text":"\n\nWe present a comprehensive study of the robustness of H-deficient post-asymptotic giant branch (AGB) tracks. We show that such tracks are not robust against vertical mixing, even in the case of non-supportive underlying flow. We consider tracks with a range of H-deficiencies, from slightly H-deficient to strongly H-deficient, in both supported and non-supported flows, and with a range of different mixing strengths. We find that the mixing strength required to destroy the track increases rapidly with H-deficiency. In other words, a track is relatively more robust against mixing if it is only slightly H-deficient compared to when it is strongly H-deficient. We also find that the required mixing strength depends only weakly on the supportiness of the underlying flow. These results are consistent with the idea that a track becomes less robust as the individual fibers making up the track become more tightly wound up. Our results suggest that a full three-dimensional treatment of the mixing process is necessary in order to correctly predict the evolution of H-deficient tracks."}
{"text":"\n\nWe revisit the born-again (VLTP) scenario for the demise of V4334 Sgr. We show that the mass of the remnants is strictly proportional to the orbital period of the donor star, provided the white dwarf has a mass below the Chandrasekhar limit. We derive a relation between the relative orbital period and the orbital eccentricity of the donor star. We show that this relation is consistent with a perfectly circular orbit for the donor star, if the mass of the remnant is large enough to avoid further accretion. We evaluate the mass of the remnants in the case of the born-again scenario, and find that it is (on average) a factor of a few less than the mass of the original white dwarf. We discuss the consequences of this for the interpretation of the observations of the system V4334 Sgr. We show that the system can be explained in the framework of the born-again scenario if the white dwarf has accreted a few Earth masses of material, but that this scenario requires a re-think if the white dwarf has accreted much more than this."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider the problem of estimating the parameters of a probability distribution when data is collected in a communication-constrained setting, where the amount of communication is limited. We propose a framework for making such estimates using a minimal amount of communication in the setting where the observations are iid and the distribution is completely specified except for the parameters. The framework is based on the idea of universal quantile estimation with feedback, and achieves the optimal rate of convergence in this setting. The framework is applicable to a large class of probability distributions, including the normal distribution. We show that the optimal rate of convergence is achieved by combining the information from three different sources: the data, the communication, and the quantile estimates based on the data and communication. We analyze the optimal rate of convergence for different distributions, and show that the rate of convergence is a function of the amount of communication as well as the tails of the distribution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method via numerical examples."}
{"text":"\nWe consider the asymptotics of hypergeometric multisums of the form \n$$\\label{eq:asym}\n\\sum_{i=0}^\\infty \\prod_{j=1}^N (1-z)^{j-1} (1+z)^i = \\sum_{i=0}^\\infty \\prod_{j=1}^N \\exp\\left( -z\\log(1-z) + iz \\right) .$$\nThe motivation for our research is that such multisums appear in the analysis of certain random models, in particular in the theory of random subordinators. Our main idea is to use the technique offull transformation of the exponential functions into the form involving the increments of the exponential functions and the corresponding logarithms. This approach allows to obtain an asymptotic formula for the multisum in the case when the degree of each polynomial in the multisum is equal to one. In this case the multisum (1) has a simple representation: \n$$\\label{eq:asym1}\n\\sum_{i=0}^\\infty \\prod_{j=1}^N (1-z)^{j-1} (1+z)^i = \n\\sum_{i=0}^\\infty \n\\exp\\left( -z\\log(1-z) + iz \\right)\n\\prod_{j=1}^N \\exp\\left( -z \\right)\n=\n\\exp\\left( -z \\right)\n\\sum_{i=0}^\\infty \n\\exp\\left( -z\\log(1-z) + iz \\right)\n\\exp\\left( z \\right) .$$\nThe last equality is obtained by using the fact that $\\exp\\left( -z \\right)\n\\exp\\left( z \\right) = 1$ and the properties of the exponential function.

{"text":"\n\nWe present photometric and spectroscopic observations of galaxies in clusters at $0.2\\le z\\le 0.6$. We find that the cluster red sequence is dominated by galaxies that are still quite blue in color, with the number of galaxies becoming increasingly red with clustercentric distance. The average redshift of the cluster red sequence is $z\\sim 1.5$. We find that the observed correlation between clustercentric distance and galaxy color is consistent with an increase in the star formation efficiency with clustercentric distance of $\\sim 1$ mag. We also present a simple model in which the decrease in the effective radius of a cluster with increasing redshift is included. The model produces a good fit to the data, and allows a prediction of the evolution of the number density of luminous galaxies in clusters. We find that the number density of luminous galaxies in clusters increases with clustercentric distance and then decreases with increasing redshift, with a peak number density at $z\\sim 1$. This is consistent with the hypothesis that the peak number density is determined by the number of clusters in the survey, while the decrease with redshift is due to the galaxies in the most distant clusters being drawn away from the clusters by the expansion of the Universe. We also present an analysis of the variation of the color of the cluster red sequence as a function of clustercentric distance, and find that the color distribution of the cluster red sequence is consistent with a single burst of star formation per cluster. We discuss the implications of our results for the future of cluster galaxies, and for the evolution of the large-scale structure in the Universe."}
{"text":"\n\nInflationary de Sitter solutions from superstrings\n\nWe consider the structure of solutions to Einstein's equations which are inspired by the de Sitter solution in an inflationary regime. Our basic idea is to use the Hamiltonian from the 11-dimensional superstring which has a cosmological constant term in a similar way as in the 4-dimensional case. The main difference is that we have two extra scalar fields which we can couple to gravity in a way to obtain the inflationary de Sitter solution. We show that these solutions have the same qualitative structure as the original de Sitter solution and in particular they have a big bounce at the end of the inflationary epoch.\n\nWe show that the bulk dynamics during the inflationary epoch is described by a closed Einstein universe with the cosmological constant term and a scalar field which is coupled to gravity in a way to obtain a solution with the speed of sound proportional to the scalar field. We show that this solution has a big bounce at the end of the inflationary epoch. In the effective Einstein theory with the cosmological constant term and a single scalar field this bounce has a very special structure. We show that the special structure of this bounce is related to the properties of the cosmological constant term in the effective Einstein theory. In particular we show that this special structure can be obtained only if the bulk dynamics is described by a specific class of Einstein solutions with the cosmological constant term and a single scalar field.\n\nThe solutions which we obtain in this way are exact solutions with a finite number of terms. We show that these solutions can be obtained from the 11-dimensional superstring by using the formalism of theEffective Einstein Theory."}
{"text":"\n\nWe have investigated the effects of a strong dipole moment and the presence of a two-level system (TLS) on the vibrational spectrum of a model glass former. We find that a vibrational instability can be induced in glasses by a strong dipole moment, which is enhanced by the presence of a TLS. The effect is more pronounced for the case of a single frequency of vibration, which results in a dramatic increase in the spectral width and a strong temperature dependence. In the case of a broadband spectrum, the effect of the vibrational instability is less pronounced.\n\nWe also study the effect of the vibrational instability on the boson peak, which is a feature of the density of states in glasses. We find that the boson peak is broadened by the presence of the vibrational instability, but that the position of the peak is not affected. The effect of the vibrational instability on the power law index of the boson peak is also investigated.\n\nThe results of our work are consistent with the idea that the vibrational instability is due to the strong dipole moment and the TLS. We propose that the vibrationally excited state is formed by the combination of the monopole and dipole degrees of freedom, which leads to a strong coupling between the two. The presence of the TLS results in a large non-linearity in the system, which is responsible for the vibrational instability.\n\nThe practical implications of our work are that glasses with a strong dipole moment and a TLS are likely to be more susceptible to vibrational instability. This could have important implications for the properties of glasses, such as their mechanical and thermal properties."}
{"text":"\n\nHot Jupiters in binary star systems\nWe present phase-resolved spectroscopy and photometry of the giant planets in the hot Jupiter systems TWA 5 and TWA 7. The observations were made with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) during the course of the Hubble Outer Planet Quest (OPQ) program. We find that both giants are inflated hot Jupiters, with equilibrium temperatures of \u22481000 K and \u22481280 K for TWA 5b and TWA 7b, respectively. The measured angular sizes of the giants are in good agreement with those obtained from models in which the giants are treated as perfect gases, but in disagreement with models in which the effects of interior structure are included. The radii of both giants are larger than predicted by theoretical models, but this discrepancy can be explained by small-scale mixing of heavy elements in the interior. We find that the kinematics of the giant planets are consistent with a perfectly coplanar orbit, and thus the giant planets in these systems do not exhibit significant orbital decay. We discuss these findings in the context of hot Jupiter system evolution, and consider the prospects for observing giant planet thermodynamics with the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope."}
{"text":"\n\nWe show that the energy spectra of the velocity increments in highly compressible turbulence display scaling laws that are consistent with a modified form of the Kolmogorov theory that includes a correction that depends only on the compressibility and the Reynolds number.

We find that the energy spectrum of the velocity increments is close to the Kolmogorov spectrum for Re >> Mc, where Mc is the Kolmogorov microscale, and it diverges as Re << Mc. We also find that the correlation functions of the velocity increments are close to the Navier-Stokes correlation functions for Re >> Mc and they decay algebraically as Re << Mc.

We show that the structure functions are related to the scattering functions of the turbulent field and that the knowledge of the structure functions can be used for the prediction of the energy spectrum of the velocity increments."}
{"text":"\nWe study the resolution of free fermion supergroup WZNW models in the thermodynamic limit. The free fermion fields are assumed to have no external sources, but are rather coupled to the WZNW model in a way that allows for the breakdown of the supergroup into its constituents. We consider the simplest case of a WZNW model with a single W' index and a single Z' index. The breaking of the supergroup symmetry results in a model with two types of gauge bosons and a single type of fermion. We show that this model can be quantized, and that its spectrum contains only states with vanishing energy. This implies that the resolved model does not have a physical ground state, and hence that it is not stable. We then study the more general case of a WZNW model with multiple W' indices and multiple Z' indices. The breaking of the supergroup symmetry results in a model with multiple types of gauge bosons and multiple types of fermions. We show that this model can be quantized, and that its spectrum contains only states with vanishing energy. This implies that the resolved model does not have a physical ground state, and hence that it is not stable. We also show that the resolved model can be obtained by taking the tensor product of the primary WZNW model with a certain (non-trivial) representation of the fermionic group. This has implications for the theory of representations of non-Abelian groups."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a detailed study of the structure and dynamics of ion-cyclotron beams in the multi-fluid coronal plasma. We focus on the low-frequency regime, where the beams are stable against bending and where the bulk plasma is highly collisional.

The main result is that the drift velocity is always positive, except in a small parameter domain, where it can be negative. We show that this result can be obtained by a simple consideration of the different possible ion-cyclotron frequencies in a multi-fluid plasma. We confirm our theoretical predictions by comparing our results with three different sets of observations: (i) measurements of the drift velocity from NASA's MSlab-EX and Hi-C probes, (ii) EUV images of the coronal holes from the Solar Dynamics Observatory, and (iii) spectropolarimetric observations from the Solar Heliospheric Observatory.

{"text":"\nWe study statistical mechanics models of time-independent non-dissipative nonequilibrium states. We develop a general formalism for such states, which are characterized by a density matrix that is not in general time-reversible. A key element in the analysis is a definition of a flow-like quantity that is related to the number of quantum walks of a given length that can be performed in the system. We show that this flow is related to the thermodynamic flow of an ideal gas, and that, in the case of a symmetric system, the statistical mechanics of the nonequilibrium states can be obtained from the statistical mechanics of the equilibrium states by a change of variables. We apply our method to the simple case of a symmetric system with a single degree of freedom, and study the properties of the statistical ensemble. In particular we show the existence of a new type of symmetry, which we call a resource symmetry, and a new type of nonequilibrium state, which we call a resource state. We also derive a general expression for the kinetic energy of the resource states."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a new set of N-body simulations of structure formation in the Universe, in which we study the effects of various cooling functions on the evolution of the matter density field. We have chosen the case of an expanding Universe with a negative spatial curvature, which corresponds to a model in which the scale factor increases over time. We employ a cooling function which is very general and contains as special cases the power law cooling and the two-zone cooling functions used previously in N-body simulations. We find that the main difference between the various cooling functions is the different initial conditions that they generate. For all cooling functions the evolution is always a slow descent towards a power law density field. The power of the density field is, however, different in general. The only case in which the power law index is not modified during the evolution is the case of the power law cooling function. For this special case we can also investigate the variation of the power law index as a function of the total matter content of the Universe. Our numerical results show that the evolution of the density field is very sensitive to the choice of the initial conditions. We find that the choice of the cooling function has only a very small effect on the final structure of the Universe. The results are in agreement with the conclusion that the evolution is governed by the slow descent towards a power law density field, and that the initial conditions have a far more important role in the evolution than the cooling function."}
{"text":"\n\nWe describe the calibration and data products of the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX), a space-borne ultraviolet-light telescope that was launched in 2003 and operated until it was decommissioned in 2013. GALEX was designed to map the sky in the ultraviolet with three different filters, two of which were substantially Broadband Imaging Spectrometers (BISs) that produced images of galaxies in the 350-650 nm and 160-210 nm wavelength ranges. The third filter was a pointed spectrometer that produced a spectrum of a selected point in the sky in the 900-1700 nm wavelength range. We describe the instrument's calibration, the data products produced, the data quality, and the level to which the products met the requirements of the science mission. We find that GALEX was a successful mission that produced high-quality data products that meet the requirements of the science mission. We also find that the GALEX calibration and data products are sufficiently well characterized that they could be used to produce high-quality scientific results with little additional effort."}
{"text":"\nWe study the dynamics of a single-mode laser field in an optical lattice. We find a novel type of the fractional quantum Hall effect, which is distinct from the linear and non-linear quantum Hall effects. The new effect is related to the interplay between the evolution of the light field and the discrete spatial structure of the optical lattice. We observe the formation of a quasicrystallic state in which the light field is spatially locked in a single lattice site. Our theoretical analysis shows that this state is characterized by a strong quantum correlation between the light field and the lattice. The fraction of the field intensity which is trapped in the lattice can be controlled by a suitable choice of the parameters. We show that this fraction increases with the lattice spacing, reaches a maximum, and then decreases with increasing lattice spacing. We also find a critical value of the lattice spacing, below which the field is completely localized in a single lattice site. Our results suggest that the new type of the quantum Hall effect can be used for the design of novel light sources, with interesting spectral and spatial properties."}
{"text":"\n\nWe show existence of smooth solutions for the rapidly rotating shallow-water and Euler equations. The solutions are given in the form of conservation laws for a certain class of functions. The solutions exist in a neighborhood of the origin and are regular in a neighborhood of the core. We show that the solutions are stable with respect to the small parameter $\\dot \\omega \\ll 1$. This allows us to regularize the solution by a Taylor expansion in this small parameter. In the limit $\\dot \\omega \\to 0$ the solution can be recovered from the conservation laws and the initial conditions. The solutions can be thought of as a generalization of the lazy-wave solution to the case of rapidly rotating flow. The solutions have a variety of interesting physical applications. In particular we show that they can be used to describe the flow in a rotating cylindrical tank with an insoluble contaminant, the flow in a rotating shallow water of constant depth with an impurity, the motion of a flexible membrane in a rotating frame, the dynamics of rotating bodies in a viscous fluid, and the evolution of vorticity in a rotating fluid."}
{"text":"\n\nMotivation:\nWhile the extraction of shape features from point clouds is well-developed, it is still an open problem to robustly and efficiently extract higher-level properties, such as genus or dimensions, from large point clouds of different shapes. In this work, we focus on the extraction of sequence to shape maps from large point clouds. \n\nKey ideas and methodology:\nWe propose a simple yet effective algorithm to extract sequence to shape maps from large point clouds. Our method takes advantage of the point cloud's local structure and the hierarchical octree to obtain a low-dimensional representation of the input point cloud. In our method, the shape features are extracted from this low-dimensional representation instead of the original point cloud. Since the low-dimensional representation has a much lower dimensionality than the original point cloud, the shape features can be efficiently extracted in our method. Our method has two main steps. In the first step, we construct a hierarchical octree from the input point cloud. In the second step, we extract the shape features from the leaf nodes of the hierarchical octree. The shape features extracted by our method can be used to represent the input point cloud. \n\nResults:\nWe evaluated our method on two benchmark point clouds. Our method achieved state-of-the-art performance in both tests. \n\nProblem work attempts to solve:\nOur work attempts to solve the problem of extracting sequence to shape maps from large point clouds. Our method is able to robustly and efficiently extract the shape features from large point clouds. \n\nPractical or theoretical applications:\nThe extracted shape features can be used to represent the input point cloud. Our method can be used to extract shape features from large point clouds in practical applications such as object recognition and segmentation. The extracted shape features can also be used in theoretical applications such as shape classification."}
{"text":"\nWe present a comprehensive analysis of jet-driven disk accretion in low luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGN) based on the radiative transfer code MCGARLY. We evaluate the disk accretion rate, the mass accretion rate, the power law index of the mass accretion rate, and the accretion efficiency. We find that the accretion efficiency is in the range 0.1-0.4, which is higher than previously estimated. The power law index of the mass accretion rate is steeper than 1.5 in all cases, which is consistent with the predictions of the Sellers-BeskQuota model. We discuss the effects of the physical properties of the disk on the accretion process and find that a higher efficiency is obtained when the disk is less massive, has a higher surface area, or has a higher temperature. The relative importance of these physical properties on the efficiency is different for different galaxies. We also analyze the influence of the jet properties on the disk accretion process and find that the most efficient accretion occurs when the jet-to-disk interaction time is shorter. The results of this work provide physical insights into the disk accretion process in low luminosity AGN and help to understand the origin of the disks in these galaxies."}
{"text":"\nWe propose and analyze a novel scheme for measuring the decoherence time of a quirked quantum bit, or quantonium, embedded in a quantum computer. Our scheme is based on a cavity- squeezed-state generation and relies on the quirked bit being embedded in a superconducting quantum computer. We show that our scheme is applicable to a variety of quantum computers and, in particular, it is more suitable for qubit registers in which the qubit coherence time is relatively long. We derive a simple formula for the probability of success of our scheme, which depends on the structure of the quantum computer, the details of the measurement protocol, and the level of squeezing. Our scheme is robust with respect to thermal noise and detector inefficiencies, provided that the qubit coherence time is long enough. We analyze the experimental challenges of our scheme and propose several possible realizations. Our scheme is in principle independent of the particular physical system used to realize the qubit, and thus it can be applied to a variety of systems, including superconducting qubits, ion traps, and solid-state qubits."}
{"text":"\n\nIC 342 is a young, high-mass star-forming region in the constellation of Camelopardalis. The ionized gas in the center of this molecular cloud is energized by a recently-formed, massive star, designated as 3.4 million solar masses by Appenzeller et al. (1997). We present here high-resolution X-ray images of the central region, obtained with the Chandra Observatory. These data reveal the presence of a bright X-ray source at the center of IC 342, which we attribute to the presence of a collimated outflow from the high-mass star. We find that the observed X-ray surface brightness is consistent with a single, power law distribution with a slope of -1.4 \u00b1 0.1. The half-light radius is estimated to be  \u223c 1.3 kpc, and the X-ray surface brightness is  \u223c 2.5 kpc2. We find that the X-ray emission is most likely due to a combination of a shocked wind from the high-mass star and material evaporated from the molecular cloud. We show that a simple formulation of the ionization-hydrogen-streaming-Expansion (IHSX) model is consistent with the observed X-ray surface brightness distribution. Alternatively, the X-ray emission may be due to a combination of a shocked wind from the high-mass star and material evaporated from the molecular cloud. We discuss the properties of the high-mass star and the evolution of the X-ray emitting region."}
{"text":"\n\nWe investigate theoretically the direct photon absorption in silicon and germanium nanocrystals embedded in a wide band-gap lattice. We calculate the differential cross sections for photon absorption in the interband, intraband, and excited-state direct transitions for a range of nanocrystal sizes. The main finding is the appearance of a strong wavelength dependence of the cross section in the nanocrystals of a few nanometers in size. We explain this effect by the presence of a discrete (degenerate) energy level in these nanocrystals. The results are consistent with the earlier experimental observation of the strong wavelength dependence of the extinction coefficient in Si nanocrystals. We also found the reduction of the cross section in the intraband and excited-state transitions as the nanocrystal size becomes smaller. The size-dependent behavior of the interband cross section is explained by the nanocrystal's size-dependent quantum confinement, while the reduction in the intraband and excited-state cross sections is due to the increase of the optical phonon scattering as the nanocrystal size decreases."}
{"text":"\nWe present a study of the nanomechanics of single keratin fibres using Raman spectroscopy. The motivation for this work is a desire to understand the mechanical properties of keratin fibres at the molecular level in order to gain fundamental knowledge that may be relevant to the design of new hair care products. We have investigated the effect of water on the alpha helix -> beta sheet transition temperature of the keratin polypeptide using high resolution Raman spectroscopy. We have also characterised the distribution of the different types of bonds present in the keratin fibre. The results of this work show that the water soluble fraction of the keratin fibre consists almost entirely of alpha helical structure, while the water insoluble fraction is largely beta sheet structure. The results also show that the transition temperature for the alpha helix -> beta sheet transition is significantly affected by the presence of water, with the transition temperature being raised by the presence of water. The practical application of this work is that it may be possible to design hair care products that can stabilise the alpha helix structure of the keratin polypeptide, and thus give better curl retention to the hair."}
{"text":"\n\nA Huge Filamentary Structure at z=0.55 and Star Formation Histories of Galaxies at z<1\n\nWe present a huge filamentary structure at z=0.55, which is likely the largest over-density in the local volume. It is comprised of two almost perfectly aligned filaments, possibly corresponding to a super-cluster and a cluster, respectively. We determine the 1-zone gravitational potential of this structure, and find that it is very well described by a twin-halos model with the two filaments and the matter between them considered as a single, almost spherical, over-density. We determine the statistical star formation history (SFH) of a sample of galaxies at z<1 drawn from a 10 deg^2 survey with the 6.5 m Magellan Telescopes, and find that the shape of the SFH is well described by a broken power law with a break at log(Mpc\/h)~1.5. We show that the huge filamentary structure has a major impact on the SFHs of galaxies in its vicinity, especially those in the northern half, where the mean star formation rate is suppressed by a factor of ~3 compared to the mean rate in the sample, and the median star formation rate is even lower. We show that the suppression of star formation is most likely due to the presence of the huge filament, which has a very large impact on the local potential field. We discuss the implication of this finding on the evolution of large-scale structures, and in particular on the role of super-clusters in the process of structure formation."}
{"text":"\n\nSpace Velocities of L- and T-type Dwarfs\n\nWe present new observations of the space velocities of 75 L- and T-type dwarfs in an attempt to determine whether these objects follow random orbits or display evidence of communal motion. The data are from an eight-year program in which the applauded but seldom used technique of finding relative velocities from proper motion was used to obtain space velocities for these stars. The stars were observed as they passed in front of, or transited, 27 glaciers and 20 stars. The glaciers have a well-determined motion, and so their velocity is known. Thus, by measuring the difference between the glacier velocity and the dwarf velocity, the space velocity of the dwarf can be found. We find that the space velocities of the L-dwarfs are distributed randomly in a range of plus or minus 7 km\/s, with no evidence of any preferred velocity. We find that the T-dwarfs display a non-random motion, with a statistically significant preference for a velocity of plus or minus 3.5 km\/s. Thus, although both the L- and T-dwarfs are known to have a close relation to the giants in their respective galactic neighborhoods, the L-dwarfs are apparently not moving in as a group, while the T-dwarfs are. We discuss a number of possible physical explanations for this difference."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider the construction of Bayesian deformable models via stochastic approximation. The motivation for our work is the difficulty of learning such models from data in a high-dimensional space. We show that the convergence rate of the stochastic approximation algorithm is related to the geometry of the model space and the choice of the prior distribution. In particular, we show that the convergence rate is faster if the prior is a Gaussian process, as opposed to a simple Gaussian distribution. This conclusion is derived from a rigorous analysis of the mean of the algorithm. The analysis also provides a general framework for studying the convergence of stochastic approximation algorithms for non-convex optimization problems. In order to illustrate our theory, we consider two examples. The first example is a bayesian linear regression model with a Gaussian process prior. The second example is a bayesian elastic net model with a Gaussian process prior. In both examples the algorithm is shown to converge to the true model with probability one, as the number of iterations goes to infinity."}
{"text":"\nWe present here the results of a detailed study of solar-like oscillations in the metal-poor subgiant nu Indi. Using high-resolution optical and near-infrared spectroscopy, we derive the properties of the acoustic spectrum in the inner-core region of the star. The observed power density spectrum can be described by a beta model with a baseline frequency of  \u223c 280 Hz, a spectral index of  \u223c 7, and a relative amplitude of  \u223c 3. We find that the non-linear frequency shift due to the gravity darkening is  \u223c 100 Hz. By fitting a simple model to the observed power density spectrum, we obtain the values of the gravity darkening parameter \u03b1 \u223c 1.6 and the microturbulent velocity  \u223c 5 km s \u2212 1. The density and temperature structure of the star is derived from the frequency-dependent temperature and density fluctuations. The temperature structure is characterized by a negative excursion in the interior of the star, which may be due to a hidden solar-like cycle. We also derive the mode lifetime and find that it increases with frequency. We discuss these results in the framework of stellar structure and evolution."}
{"text":"\nWe report on a scheme for the continuous loading of $^{1}S_{0}$ calcium atoms into an optical dipole trap. The method is based on the transportation of atoms from an atomic beam to the trap using a time-dependent form of the trap potential which is utilized to control the relative position of the atomic beam and the trap. The transportation process is found to be very fast and robust with a typical transportation time of less than 1 ms. The loaded $^{1}S_{0}$ atoms show a high degree of motional symmetry and a narrow distribution in their angular orientation with respect to the dipole axis. We show that a simple model of the dipole trap potential can quantitatively describe the loaded atom's distribution in the trap. The model includes a potential minimum which is slightly shifted in the radial direction with respect to the trap center in order to obtain a better description of the loaded atom's distribution. We also discuss a simple scheme how to obtain a deeper understanding of the dynamic properties of the loaded atoms by performing a time-of-flight measurement in the trap."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present here observations of the exceptional VHE gamma-ray flare from PKS 2155-304, a Type II-P core-collapse supernova (SN) observed in 2000, which reached its peak on January 2, 2002. Our observations were carried out with the H.E.S.S. array of atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes between September 2002 and March 2004. We find that the source flux in the energy range above 100 GeV is well described by a power law with a photon index of 1.4 \u00b1 0.3 and a turnover at an energy of \u223c 6 TeV. We extract the intrinsic (Point Source Vehicle, PSV) flux from the observed flux after applying a simple two-dimensional (2D)Clean algorithm. The PSV flux is found to be constant in the energy range between 1 and 2 TeV and to increase with energy above 2 TeV. A 1D Clean analysis shows that the source is point-like, with a slightly extended structure, and that it is located at the center of the SN, in agreement with the hypothesis that the flare is due to the formation of a rotating toroid around the black hole that formed from the SN. We discuss the energy distribution of the observed flare in the framework of different theoretical models."}

{"text":"\nWe present a set of numerical stellar population models that incorporate both mean atomic number and relative elemental abundance variations within a given stellar Initial Mass Function (IMF). We show that this approach is crucial in order to properly describe the observed correlations between stellar properties and the elemental abundances in their atmospheres. We assess the effects of variations in both the number of elements and their relative abundances, as well as the different chemical enrichment levels on the derived stellar properties. The aim of this work is to investigate the effects of the chemical composition on stellar evolution, in order to improve our understanding of the evolution of chemical elements in the Galaxy and the processes that regulate their distribution. We also show that the stellar models with the most extreme initial conditions, in terms of both number of elements and their relative abundances, do not produce the most extreme output. The results are consistent with a gradual increase of the number of elements in the Galactic medium, as well as a progressive increase of the relative abundances of the heavy elements with time. We find that this evolutionary picture is consistent with the chemical composition of massive stars in the present-day Galactic plane, and with the different chemical groups found in the solar neighbourhood. The problem of element production and distribution is also discussed, in the framework of simple chemical evolution models. Finally, we point out that individual element abundances can be used as a precise diagnostic tool of stellar evolution, providing new and independent information on the birth and life of stars."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a comparison of the optical-IR properties of galaxies in the Local Volume into which the Hubble Deep Field has stared, and of galaxies in the z~1 Hubble Deep Field. We find that the galaxies in the Local Volume have dust-re Ryu et al. albedos five times larger on average than the galaxies in the z~1 Deep Field, suggesting that the dust content of galaxies has decreased significantly with redshift. A comparison of the dust-to-stellar mass ratios for star-forming galaxies in the Local Volume and in the z~1 Deep Field shows that this ratio has decreased with redshift. We suggest that this is consistent with a simple model in which the conversion of gas to dust proceeds at a nearly constant rate, while the gas-to-stellar mass ratio decreases with redshift due to the finite gas-richness of the universe and the star formation efficiency. Our results suggest that the dust attenuation in star-forming galaxies is an important factor affecting the evolution of their optical-IR properties with redshift."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present the first CO J=6-5, 4-3 detections in two local ULIRGs: Mrk231 and Mrk650. These detections provide a critical benchmark for comparison with models of molecular cloud formation and evolution. We find that the derived molecular line luminosities are consistent with the CO-dark cloud model of Churchwell & 1996, if the molecular clouds are thermally-stratified with the CO-rich layer placed near the cloud's cold trap. The model also predicts that the CO luminosity should be proportional to the cloud's cooling budget, which is in turn proportional to the cloud's mass. We find that this prediction is consistent with the observed correlation between the molecular line luminosity and the total infrared luminosity, both in the optically-selected sample of clouds and in the subset of clouds that are particularly dense. This indicates that the cloud's mass is indeed proportional to its cooling budget, at least for the dense clouds in our sample. We find that the most dense clouds have a cooling budget that is about 2-4 times their mass, consistent with the predictions of the model. However, we also find that the least dense clouds have a cooling budget that is about 10 times their mass. This is a problem for the model, which predicts that the cooling budget should be proportional to the cloud's mass. We discuss several possible explanations for this discrepancy, including the possibility that the least dense clouds are not yet gravitationally stable. We find that the relative molecular line luminosity of the inner region compared to the outer region is consistent with the cloud being isothermal, at least for the cases where we have sufficient resolution to distinguish between the inner and outer regions. We discuss the implications of our results for future research."}
{"text":"\nWe propose a new framework for understanding the dynamics of anisotropic MHD turbulence. Our approach is based on the idea that nonlocal correlations carry critical information about the dynamics of the system. We show that in anisotropic MHD turbulence, the nonlocal structure functions are related to the underlying local structures in a universal way, which allows us to give a simple and general description of the nonlocal dynamics. Our description is based on the concept of the anisotropic relaxation time, which is related to the inverse of the correlation length. We show that the anisotropic relaxation time has a simple expression in terms of the standard local structure functions, and that it is a universal, nearly constant quantity that characterizes the dynamics of the system. We show that the dynamics of the nonlocal structure functions can be described by a simple analogy to the dynamics of the energy spectrum. We also show that the nonlocal dynamics is largely insensitive to the details of the local dynamics, except for a slow evolution of the anisotropic relaxation time, which is driven by the local dynamics. This framework provides a new and powerful way of understanding the dynamics of anisotropic MHD turbulence."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present the results of a statistical study of the spectral energy distributions of quasars in the Smithsonian Palomar-Green (SPG) survey. The SPGs are the largest and most homogeneously selected sample of quasars yet compiled. They were selected from 2MASS galaxies without known redshifts, on the basis of their very strong emission lines. The selection criteria have produced a sample of quasars with very well-defined properties. We describe the methods used to extract the spectral energy distributions, and we present a catalog of the properties of the quasars in the sample. The catalog includes a determination of the exact redshift for each quasar, as well as its 2MASS ID number. We present a statistical study of the spectral energy distributions of quasars in the SPs, and we find that they differ significantly from those of quasars in the rest of the quasar population. The quasars in the SPs are, on average, at higher redshift, are more distant, and have accretion rates that are, on average, lower than those of quasars in the general quasar population. We show that these differences are consistent with the idea that the quasars in the SPs are at an early stage of their evolution, while those in the general quasar population are at a later stage."}

{"text":"\n\nWe study the dynamics of localization phenomena for hardcore bosons in optical lattices. We consider a system of many ultracold bosons at absolute zero temperature, hosted in an optical lattice, and subject to a weak avoided crossing between different orbital states. We find that such a system is stable against thermal fluctuations, in the sense that the fraction of atoms that are localized in the lattice, instead of being uniformly distributed, does not decay with time. We analyze the dependence of the fraction of localized atoms on the parameters of the system, in particular on the boson mass m, the lattice spacing a, and the avoided crossing strength \u0394. Our results are consistent with the idea that the system is in a state of arrested development: the fraction of localized atoms does not increase with time, it does not decrease either, and it is very sensitive to the parameters of the system. We show that this fraction displays power law statistics, with an exponent that depends on the parameters of the system, and we discuss the possibility of a critical behavior for some values of the parameters. Our results suggest that there is a range of parameters for which the dynamics of localization phenomena is driven by a delicate balance between different interactions, and for which small perturbations can have a strong effect on the statistical properties of the system."}
{"text":"\nWe show that the Central Limit Theorem holds for a large class of linear structural error-in-variables models with explanatory variables in the domain of attraction of the normal law. This class includes the classical least squares model with an error term following a general normal distribution, with independent or not independent observations. We assume that the model matrix is invertible and we show that the covariance matrix of the associated estimate is a function of the degree of freedom of the error term only through the matrix inverse of the model matrix. We derive the limit distribution as a explicit function of this degree of freedom and of the parameters of the model and we show that the limit distribution is a function of the model matrix only through its inverse. The only assumption we make on the model is that the matrix of explanatory variables is invertible. We show that the law of the estimate is a special case of a more general rule for the law of the limit distribution of the estimate of a linear combination of random variables which is in the domain of attraction of a stable law. As an application, we show that the law of the estimate of the trace of a positive definite matrix is a special case of a more general rule for the law of the limit distribution of the estimate of a linear combination of random variables which is in the domain of attraction of the normal law."}
{"text":"\nWe present a systematic study of the merging activity of galaxy clusters as a crucial element to understand the kinetic polarization of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) signal. We aim to investigate the role of the merging activity in the energy injection in the intra-cluster medium (ICM) and, consequently, in the shape of the SZ profile. We find that the impact of the merging activity on the shape of the SZ profile depends on the amplitude of the perturbations as well as on the cluster's properties. We show that the depolarization of the SZ signal due to the merging activity depends on the ratio between the optical and the radio cluster sizes. We also analyze the effect of the bulk flow velocity on the depolarization and we find that the higher the bulk flow velocity, the less sensitive the SZ signal is to the merging activity. We derive a simple analytic expression for the expected shape of the SZ profile in clusters with a large optical size and find that the shape is well described by a series of spherical harmonics. Finally, we conclude that in clusters with a large optical size the shape of the SZ profile is mainly determined by the distribution of the mass in the ICM while in clusters with a small optical size the shape is largely influenced by the merging activity."}
{"text":"\n\nPossible evolution of dim radio quiet neutron star 1E 1207.4-5209 based on a B-decay model\n\nWe consider the hypothesis that the X-ray transient 1E 1207.4-5209 is a recently formed neutron star with a short cooling age (t<104 years) and a very low magnetic field. We test this hypothesis by using a simple model in which the evolution of the magnetic field is driven by the radioactive decay of 56Co. We find that the magnetic field has to be much stronger than observed in order to account for the observed radio activity. We conclude that either the transient is a very old object or that its magnetic field has been highly altered on a timescale of about 105 years. If the transient is an old object (t>104 years), the observed X-ray flux can be explained by the decay of 56Co alone. We also consider the case of a low-mass X-ray binary with a white dwarf companion, and find that the required accretion rate is too high to be consistent with the observed properties. We therefore conclude that 1E 1207.4-5209 is most likely a radio-loud neutron star with a strong magnetic field, and that it has been accreting for much longer than the observed cooling age. \n\nWe thank J.

{"text":"\nWe present here results of a monitoring campaign, carried out with INTEGRAL, of the hard X-ray transient KS 1741-293. The source was observed during a monitoring campaign in February-March 2002, with the INTEGRAL instruments OCK and SPI. We find that the accretion phase lasts at most 2-3 hours, with a few outbursts per year. The observed phenomenology is consistent with a smoothly increasing flux triggered at the periastron passage in a wide eccentric orbit with many short-lived (a few hours) accretion pulses and a final flaring phase of a few minutes when the gas is directly transferred to the white dwarf. The observed phenomenology is consistent with a continuous accretion process in which the gas is first accumulated in a large orbit and then gradually transferred to the white dwarf. The accretion process is likely to be a direct accretion onto the white dwarf. We discuss a possible explanation for the observed phenomenology in terms of a model in which the accretion process is controlled by the instability of a cavity around the white dwarf. We show that the main parameters of the system can be derived from the observed phenomenology. In particular we find that the white dwarf has a relatively long spin period (41-67 min) and that the accretion rate is at most 1.4 10^33 erg s^-1. We discuss a simple model in which the accretion process is treated as a viscous disc around the white dwarf. We show that such a model is consistent with the observed phenomenology and that it predicts a critical accretion rate of log(R_(acc)\/R_WD) = -1.1, where R_acc is the accretion rate and R_WD is the radius of the white dwarf."}
{"text":"\nWe report on a detailed study of the sub-Doppler spectroscopy of Cesium vapor confined in an extremely thin cell. We have observed three different regimes of sub-Doppler oscillations. The main motivation for this work was the lack of theoretical predictions for the sub-Doppler response in this system, which is a candidate for the realization of quantum degenerate gas cells for atomic clocks. Our results show that in all regimes the sub-Doppler spectroscopy can be used to probe the dynamics of the system, and in particular to distinguish between different models for the vapor-cell dynamics. In the quasi-2D regime the sub-Doppler oscillations show a clear signature of the limited spatial motion, thus providing a direct probe of the two-dimensional nature of the dynamics. In the 1D case, we find a clear signature of the dynamic instability of the core dynamics, and we are able to distinguish between different models for the dynamic instability.

We consider a lattice of N sites, each of which can be occupied by a boson with one of two possible spins. In a symmetric configuration, there are N\/2 bosons with one spin and N\/2 with the other. We find that below a certain temperature, the system becomes bistable, and can exist in either a low-temperature phase, where the spins are uncorrelated and the distribution is symmetric, or a high-temperature phase, where the spins are correlated and the distribution is asymmetric. We use dynamical mean-field theory to study the statistical properties of the correlated phase, and show that it is characterized by a long-range order and a broken symmetry. In contrast, the uncorrelated phase is characterized by a short-range order and a symmetric distribution. We also consider a more general model, where the spin of each boson can take one of three values, and show that the correlated phase can be further stabilized by a symmetry-breaking field."}
{"text":"\nWe present an analysis of the stellar populations of 22 Galactic globular clusters, drawn from the database of the second Galaxy Globular Cluster Survey, in order to investigate the distribution of stellar masses, ages, and metallicities. We show that these parameters are tightly correlated in a straightforward way, and therefore provide a powerful tool for inferring the dynamical history of each cluster. We find that the Galactic globular clusters can be divided into two groups according to their mass, with high-mass clusters (M>0.5M\u2299) being characterized by younger ages and higher metallicities than low-mass clusters (M<0.5M\u2299). Within each mass group, the clusters are well described by a single isochronous track, along which their stellar populations have evolved since their inception. The mass-age-metallicity relation for the high-mass clusters is consistent with the clusters having formed together in a single star-forming episode, followed by a progressive increase in metallicities due to various forms of chemical enrichment. The mass-age-metallicity relation for the low-mass clusters is consistent with their having formed in several star-forming events, with the clusters having intermediate metallicities because of an approximately equal mix of objects from the inner and outer Galaxy. We discuss the implications of our results for the formation and evolution of the Galactic globular cluster system, and for the properties of the molecular clouds that gave rise to these clusters."}

{"text":"\n\nWe present a new method for constructing a three-dimensional map of the distribution of matter in the Universe, based on the gravitational lensing of the hydrogen (HI) radio galaxies. The method is independent of the galaxies' redshifts, but requires a redshift-dependent calibration of the lensing effect. We have constructed a catalog of 30,000 galaxies in a redshift range of 1 - 2, and use this catalog to calibrate the lensing effect. We show that the method is able to detect the matter distribution in a range of scales from clusters to super clusters, provided that the clusters are located in front of the galaxies. We demonstrate that the method is sensitive to the matter distribution in a range of concentrations from 10 - 10^2 cm^-3. We show that the clusters detected by our method are consistent with the clusters found by the current cluster detection methods. We estimate the statistical significance of our detection, and compare it to the current cluster detection methods. We also discuss the systematic errors in our method."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a simple model of the evolution of dark matter halos from the formation to the virialization stage. Our main result is that the concentration of the dark matter halos, as a function of mass, is universal in the sense that it is independent of the detailed structure of the halos. We show this by comparing our model to the observations of galaxy clusters and to the results of numerical simulations. The model is based on the idea that the formation of structure in the universe can be described by the competition between the growth of halos and the increase of the mean density in the Universe. Our model predicts that the number density of halos is proportional to the volume density of the Universe. This is in agreement with observations, and it implies that the mass of a halo is proportional to the volume of the Universe. In addition, the model predicts that the density profile of a halo is independent of its mass. We discuss the implications of our result for structure formation."}

{"text":"\nWe have developed a first-principles-based framework for the calculation of the magnetic properties of nanographenes, which are single-layer graphene sheets with finite size. Our approach is based on the consideration of the most important degrees of freedom that give rise to magnetic properties, namely, the rotational and the orbital degrees of freedom. We show that finite size effects have a strong influence on the magnetic properties of nanographenes. In particular, we find that the introduction of a finite size gap in a nanogaphene can lead to a finite magnetic moment, which is in contrast to the case of a graphene sheet, where the magnetic moment is zero. We also find that the exchange interaction between adjacent nanographenes is very sensitive to the distance between the graphene sheets, and that it can give rise to a strong antiferromagnetic interaction between the nanographenes as the distance between them decreases. Our findings are in good agreement with recent experiments on magnetic nanographenes."}
{"text":"\n\nWe propose a model for Bondi accretion in the early universe in which the accretion rate varies harmonically in space. In our model the amplitude of the spatial variation is small compared to the typical size of the universe, so the variance of the accretion rate is simply proportional to the average accretion rate. We show that this model can explain the observed correlation between the large-scale structure of the universe and the small-scale structure of the primordial perturbations. We also show that this model can naturally explain why the universe is so homogeneous on large scales. We find that this model can quantitatively reproduce the observed power spectrum, without the need to introduce non-Gaussian corrections. Our model also naturally explains why the correlation function is positive on large scales, without the need for the often invoked anti-correlation mechanism. In addition, our model can also explain why the current universe is so homogeneous on large scales. We show that our model predicts that the galaxies should be distributed in a way that is consistent with the observed large-scale structure, without the need to introduce the cold dark matter model."}
{"text":"\nWe present here results of a statistical study of X-ray emission from bursts of high-energy gamma rays, recorded with the BATSE detector on board the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory. We find that the X-ray emission is characterized by a power law decay with a decay index of -0.1 \u00b1 0.3. This is in agreement with a simple model in which the energy deposition in the burst source is assumed to be isotropic and the X-ray emission is produced by thermal bremsstrahlung and thought to be absent during the earliest stages of the burst. We have also found that the X-ray emission is closely correlated with the total energy of the burst. Our results are consistent with a simple model in which the total energy is deposited in a finite region, with a radius of R \u223c 10\u201320 kpc, and the X-ray emission is produced by thermal bremsstrahlung from electrons accelerated by a distributed source, with a power law energy spectrum, in a uniform magnetic field, B \u223c 0.5 kG. The energy distribution of the bursts is well described by a power law with a photon index of \u0393 \u223c -1.6 \u00b1 0.1. A fit to the data assuming a cosine distribution of the burst arrival times gives a burst duration of T \u223c 2.4 ks.

{"text":"\n\nWe present high-resolution, near-infrared spectroscopy and photometry of EX Hydrae, a nearby (43 pc) young solar-like object. We have combined new data with previous data sets to monitor the object's optical and near-infrared brightness and spectroscopy, from 1999 to the present. Our analysis reveals four major outbursts of EX Hydrae that are coincident with significant brightenings in the object's optical and near-infrared photometry. The first outburst occurred in late August 1999, the second in late December 1999, the third in early February 2000, and the fourth in early March 2000. The accretion rate, determined from the observed wavelength shift of the object's spectral lines, increases by a factor of three to five during the outbursts. The accretion episodes are relatively brief, lasting a few tens of days. The observed phenomenology is consistent with a smoothly increasing flux during the outbursts, followed by a slow fading of the accretion phenomenon. We estimate the accretion rate to be  \u223c 1.2 \u00d7 10 \u2212 4 M \u2299 yr \u2212 1, corresponding to a mass accretion rate that is several times higher than the values derived from single-point observations of the object's photometry.

The long-term photometric behavior of the system is complex, displaying multiple short-term cycles superimposed on a long-term trend. We find that the primary and secondary components are not identical in terms of their chromaticity. If the secondary is actually a white dwarf with a temperature of approximately 12,000,000 K, as is widely believed, then the primary has a temperature of about 8,000,000 K. We discuss this discrepancy in terms of a model in which the secondary is a B8-type star with a temperature of approximately 8,000,000 K, rather than a white dwarf. The system is found to be spectroscopically stable, with no evidence of a significant magnetic field on either component. We estimate the orbital period to be approximately 76 years, with a slightly shorter orbital period (73 years) for the brighter component. A model in which the system is treated as a single star, with a non-radial gravity darkening profile, fits the light curve well."}

The catalog is derived from a principal component analysis of the galaxies' colors in the red and blue bands, and represents a significant improvement in the efficiency of the selection process. The galaxies are preferentially selected in the blue clouds of the Strong emission line galaxies (SELF) survey. We find that the clustering of these galaxies is consistent with a power law decay, with the exponent alpha = 1.5 +- 0.3, and the correlation length $\\xi \\sim 3.2 \\hspace{.01}$ Mpc.

This correlation is in agreement with a large scale structure formation scenario in which galaxies are positioned on the nodes of the large scale structure, and are drifting away from each other along the structure's fibers. We show that the high clustering of this galaxy population cannot be explained by the mean density of the local universe, but rather requires the higher density regions characteristic of large scale structure to be included in the analysis. The fact that this population of galaxies clusters more strongly than local galaxies is consistent with the idea that it is a fossil of the large scale structure in which it was formed."}

{"text":"\nWe present the results of a systematic investigation of the properties of strong MgII absorbers in the redshift range z=0.4 to z=2.

We have identified strong MgII absorbers in 19 quasars, in most cases by using the Hubble Space Telescope, and determined the corresponding redshifts. We find that in 17 cases the lensing effect is dominant, in one case the reddening effect is dominant and in one case the extinction effect is dominant. We derive the lens model parameters in the case of a strong lensing effect, and find that the lensing objects are located at mean redshift z=1.36, with a scatter of 0.3 in redshift. We estimate the ratio of the lensing to extinction effects, and find that it is relatively constant, with a scatter of 0.3, independent of the quasar redshift.

{"text":"\n\nWe introduce and study a class of generalized entropies in the framework of the Ising ferromagnets.

The motivation for this comes from the fact that in the Ising model the number of microstates with a given entropy is not a continuous function of the entropy, in contrast to the usual statistical mechanics setting. We show that the holonomic entropy can be related to the Lagrangian of a certain action, and hence the concept of holonomy can be used to generalize the maximum entropy principle to this setting. As an application, we show that a generalized principle of minimum cross-validation error can be obtained in this way. We also study the properties of the entropies defined by the regularization of free energies, which is related to the thermal kernel, and comment on a possible connection with the laws of thermodynamics."}

{"text":"\nWe present here results of a statistical study of the radial distribution of the inner magnetosphere plasma pressure as obtained from low-altitude satellite data during the March 1-8, 1982, geomagnetic storm. Our results show that the mean plasma pressure distribution is symmetric about the magnetic dipole and is anti-symmetric with respect to the magnetic equator. The standard deviation of the plasma pressure is relatively small in the region between the dipole and 10 degrees magnetic latitude. The standard deviation increases rapidly with increasing latitude. A power law fit to the standard deviation vs. magnetic latitude gives an index of 0.75. We also find that the relative contribution of the ion and electron pressure to the total plasma pressure is symmetric with respect to the dipole and has a broad maximum near the equator. During the main phase of the storm, the relative ion pressure is greater than the relative electron pressure in the inner magnetosphere. The maximum value of the ion pressure fraction is found at 5-10 degrees magnetic latitude. The ion pressure fraction decreases faster with increasing latitude than the electron pressure fraction. The difference between the ion and electron pressure fractions has a maximum value of about 30% at 80-90 degrees magnetic latitude. The results are consistent with a model in which the ion and electron pressures are approximately symmetric with respect to the magnetic dipole, with a broad maximum near the equator, and with an additional contribution of ion pressure from the ionospheric source to the inner magnetosphere in the afternoon sector."}

{"text":"\n\nWe investigate the possible manifestations of collisions of primordial black holes (PBHs) with stars in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). We find that a significant fraction of long-duration GRBs, which contain a significant portion of the total PBH mass in the Universe, can be produced by such collisions. We consider two different mechanisms for producing gamma rays in such events: the direct collision of the PBH with the star, and the capture of the PBH by the star. We find that the main difference between these two scenarios is that in the first case the burst duration is typically shorter, while in the second case the burst may be long-duration. We also investigate the energy distribution in the burst, and find that it is consistent with the jet having a constant power law throughout the burst, with a spectral index of 1.7 on average. We discuss the implications of our results for future searches for PBHs, and conclude that the effects of stellar debris on PBHs could potentially be detected as a subtle preference for bursts from certain directions in the sky, if the PBHs are captured by the star. We also propose that a statistical analysis of the duration and energy distribution of bursts, if performed with enough statistical power, could give information about the relative importance of the two mechanisms considered here."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate the effect of an external magnetic field on the decoherence of a central spin coupled to an antiferromagnetic environment. We consider a model of a single spin in an antiferromagnet, which is subjected to an external magnetic field that can be turned on and off. The model is solved exactly and the dynamics of the spin are obtained in the presence of an external field. We find that the external field has two different effects on the decoherence of the spin. When the field is turned on, the decoherence is enhanced due to the additional correlations induced by the field. When the field is turned off, the decoherence is suppressed due to the reduction of the correlations. We also consider a model of a spin glass in an external field, where the field is applied along a particular direction. The model is solved numerically and the dynamics of the spin glass are obtained in the presence of an external field.

{"text":"\nWe present a new method for measuring the dark energy density using data from gamma-ray bursts and other cosmological probes. Our method does not require a model for the dark energy and can measure the dark energy density with only three independent probes: two probes that measure large-scale structure (such as the cosmic microwave background and large-scale galaxy surveys) and one probe that measures the growth of small-scale structure (such as the distribution of galaxy clusters on small scales or the shapes of superclusters). Our method has several advantages over previous methods that use only two probes: it is more sensitive, it is less vulnerable to systematics, and it is not model dependent. We show that our method can measure the dark energy density to within a few percent uncertainty, provided that the data from the various probes are consistent with a flat universe. We also show that our method can measure the evolution of the dark energy density with a sensitivity of a few percent, provided that the evolution is slow (i.e., the cosmological constant does not change by more than a few percent per billion years). Our method can be used to test whether the dark energy density stays constant as the universe expands, which is a major prediction of the cosmological constant model. Our method can also be used to test whether the evolution of the dark energy density is described by a model in which the cosmological constant evolves proportional to the cube of the scale factor, which is a major prediction of models with a dynamical dark energy. We discuss how our method can be used to test the cosmological constant model and models with a dynamical dark energy."}

We conclude that the mass function of young stellar clusters is mainly controlled by the cluster age. The results are consistent with the idea that the stellar mass of a cluster is proportional to the exponential of the age. We have compared the mass function of the Arches clusters with recent theories of cluster formation, and find that the predictions of the theories are consistent with our observations. We find no evidence that the mass function is controlled by the cluster initial mass."}
{"text":"\nWe construct the complex CKM matrix and the unitary $\\mu$-$\\tau$ symplectic group in the framework of the QCD-inspired approach to the standard model (SM) and the general theory of strong interactions (GR). The motivation for this work is to investigate the structure of the complex CKM matrix and the $\\mu$-$\\tau$ symmetry in the framework of the QCD-inspired approach to the SM and GR, in which the structure of the $\\mu$-$\\tau$ symmetry and the complex CKM matrix are related to the spontaneously broken $\\mu$-$\\tau$ symmetry and the complex SM, respectively. In our QCD-inspired approach to the SM and GR, we regard the $\\mu$-$\\tau$ symmetry as an underlying, spontaneously broken symmetry, and the SM and GR as the resulting $\\mu$-$\\tau$-invariant theories. The complex SM and CKM matrix are then related to the real SM and CKM matrix, respectively, as the $\\mu$-$\\tau$-invariant theories, in which the $\\mu$-$\\tau$ symmetry is not spontaneously broken. By taking into account the complex $\\mu$-$\\tau$ symmetry, we show that the structure of the complex CKM matrix is related to the structure of the real CKM matrix, and that the complex CKM matrix has a simpler structure than the real CKM matrix. We also show that the complex CKM matrix can be obtained from the real CKM matrix by taking into account the complex $\\mu$-$\\tau$ symmetry."}
{"text":"\n\nWe investigate the effect of the Pauli potential on the symmetric nuclei and the role of the semantic variable in the binding energies and radii of these nuclei. Our results show that the Pauli potential has a strong effect on the binding energy and the radius of the nuclei. We find that the binding energy is reduced and the radius is increased by the Pauli potential. We also find that the radius is more sensitive to the Pauli potential than the binding energy.\n\nThe motivation for this work is the recent observation of the symmetric nuclei in the nuclei chart and the need to understand the effect of the Pauli potential on these nuclei. The key idea is to simulate the symmetric nuclei and to investigate the role of the Pauli potential in the binding energies and radii of these nuclei. The results obtained are consistent with the observation of the symmetric nuclei in the nuclei chart. The problem this work attempts to solve is to understand the effect of the Pauli potential on the symmetric nuclei.

The theoretical application of this work is to improve our understanding of the binding energy and the radius of the nuclei."}
{"text":"\n\nWe have developed a new index of geomagnetic activity, the InterHourly-Variability (IHV) index, based on the interhourly variability of the geomagnetic field, which is related to the ionospheric and tropospheric conditions as well as the solar wind intensity. Our results show that the IHV index has clear quasi-11-year and quasi-7-year cycles that are closely related to the solar cycle. We show that the IHV index can be used to derive the long-term variation of the solar wind speed from observations of the geomagnetic field. We have tested this derived solar wind speed by comparing it with independent measurements of the solar wind speed made by the Ulysses spacecraft. The comparison shows a high degree of consistency between the long-term variations of the solar wind speed derived from the IHV index and the direct measurements made by Ulysses. This indicates that the IHV index can be used to derive the long-term variation of the solar wind speed from observations of the geomagnetic field. The IHV index has clear applications in the prediction of space weather."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate non-adiabatic transport in a quantum dot turnstile. We consider a broad range of initial conditions and find that the transport is universal, in the sense that the total transport can be predicted from the initial condition most distant from the turnstile. The transport is due to a combination of quantum tunnelling and thermal diffusion, the latter being particularly important for the initial transport away from the turnstile. The transport is found to be ballistic for a range of initial conditions, and the ballisticity is shown to be related to the interatomic distance in the quantum dot. Our results are consistent with the transport being due to a non-adiabatic flip of the electron between two atomic orbits in the quantum dot, resulting in a discrete energy spectrum with a gap between the two orbitals. We also found a good agreement between our results and those obtained by numerical solutions of the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation for a broad range of initial conditions."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a simple optimal algorithm for generating pointed trivalent diagrams and pointed triangular maps. The input to the algorithm is a set of points in general position in the plane, and the output is a minimum set of lines connecting the points in general position so that the lines form a pointed trivalent diagram (i.e., so that no three lines intersect in a single point). We prove that the output of our algorithm is always a pointed trivalent diagram, and that it is the minimum possible set of lines connecting the points that will form a pointed trivalent diagram. Our algorithm is based on a new connection between the problem of generating pointed trivalent diagrams and the problem of generating pointed triangular maps, which we term the \" triangle transform.\" The triangle transform provides a simple method for reducing the problem of generating pointed trivalent diagrams to the problem of generating pointed triangular maps, for which there is a simple optimal algorithm. Our results yield a simple optimal algorithm for generating pointed trivalent diagrams, as well as a simple proof that the algorithm is optimal."}

{"text":"\nWe study the production of heavy Higgs bosons in association with top quarks at hadron colliders, using the massive Stimulated Gravity Waves (SGW) mechanism. We find that the corresponding Higgs production cross section is enhanced compared to the Standard Model (SM) prediction, by a significant factor of  \u223c 5\u201310, provided that the mass of the heavy Higgs bosons is in the range of  \u223c 1\u20133 TeV. Our result is based on the assumption that the SGW couples to the Higgs sector in a similar way as it does to the quark sector, which is not an entirely safe assumption. If the coupling is instead much stronger to the Higgs sector, the predicted Higgs production rate can be enhanced by as much as a factor of  \u223c 100. This should be within the reach of upcoming hadron colliders such as the LHC. We also estimate the expected SGW mass threshold to be  \u223c 1\u20132 TeV. This is much smaller than the current theoretical upper limit of  \u223c 5\u201310 TeV, but still large enough to explain the non-observation of SGW so far."}
{"text":"\nWe show that the trans-Planckian issue can be rescued if the Milne universe is replaced by a Taub-NUT-WBW universe with a suitable cosmological constant. In this model the Milne universe is recovered as a special case, which corresponds to the case of a zero cosmological constant. Our main tool is the possibility to deform the Taub-NUT-WBW model in a way that it remains covariant under a transformation to a new time variable, which we call fundamental time. This deformation allows us to choose the normal time variable to be realized in the future as a local time variable, that is, as a time variable that is observer dependent. We find that only for a vanishing cosmological constant this can be chosen to be the fundamental time. This is in contrast to the case with a positive cosmological constant, where we have two possible choices for a local time variable. For the case with a negative cosmological constant our results show that no choice of a local time variable can be made, which implies that in this case the theory is in principle non-relativistic.\n\nWe would like to thank Mario Scottsdale for helpful discussions.

{"text":"\n\nDielectric Relaxation and Phase Transition at Cryogenic Temperatures in 0.65[Pb(Ni_1\/3Nb_2\/3)O_3]-0.35PbTiO_3 Ceramics.\n\nWe have studied the dielectric relaxation and phase transition in 0.65[Pb(Ni_1\/3Nb_2\/3)O_3]-0.35PbTiO_3 ceramics by measuring the dielectric constant, the dielectric loss and the temperature dependence of the dielectric constant. The dielectric constant and the dielectric loss were measured in a frequency range from 100 Hz to 5 MHz at several temperatures in the interval from room temperature to the temperature just above the cubic-to-hexagonal phase transition temperature. The results show that the dielectric constant has a small temperature coefficient in the vicinity of the phase transition temperature, and the Curie-Weiss law is satisfied. We also observed the negative temperature coefficient of the dielectric loss in the low-frequency region and a positive temperature coefficient in the high-frequency region. These results suggest that the polar nano-scale domains are randomly oriented in the cubic phase, whereas they are oriented in a uniform direction in the hexagonal phase."}
{"text":"\nWe present a theoretical study of triplet nucleon-nucleon (NN) scattering within the framework of the single index quark field theory. A set of numerical solutions is obtained for the dominant (^2) and (^2) contributions to the triplet cross section in the small and large mass Q2 regions, respectively. A comparison of our results with previous theoretical predictions, as well as with available experimental data, is made. The triplet correlation functions are calculated in the small and large mass Q2 regions, for a fixed value of the scalar couplings and for a range of triplet westonia. Our results show a fair agreement with the data for small mass Q2, but a rather poor agreement for large mass Q2, except for the latest data from the WA102 collaboration which is in a good agreement with our prediction. The analysis of the contributions to the triplet cross section and correlation functions, for different values of the triplet westonia, indicates that the large mass Q2 data is in a better agreement with the theoretical predictions if the westonia is assumed to be small. This would suggest a small value for the westonia in the large mass Q2 region, contrary to the recent indications from the WA102 collaboration for a large westonia."}
{"text":"\nWe present a systematic study of the dynamical constraints on the component masses of the cataclysmic variable WZ Sge. Our analysis is based on the motion of the system in the orbital plane, and we use a simple model in which the two white dwarfs (WDs) interact via a zone of gravity that is wide enough to include the hydrogen-burning shell of the companion WD. Within this framework, we show that the masses of the two WDs are related by a constraint equation that has two different roots, which we term \"primary\" and \"secondary.\" We find that the dynamical masses of the components in a large number of observations are consistent with the primary root, but several observations have dynamical masses that are consistent with the secondary root. We discuss several possible physical explanations for this discrepancy, including the influence of tidal interactions and the possibility that the secondary solution is merely a resonance of the primary one. We conclude that a complete understanding of the component-mass distribution in CVs requires a detailed investigation of the dynamical evolution of the system, taking into account the three-dimensional structure of the WD pair and the tidal interactions."}
{"text":"\nWe study non-Markovian entanglement dynamics of quantum continuous variable systems in thermal environments. We show that thermal noise can have a significant impact on the entanglement dynamics, in particular the entanglement per time evolution, in spite of the fact that it does not change the average entanglement. Our results indicate that a careful account of the non-Markovian dynamics is essential for a complete description of the effects of the environment on entanglement. We also analyze the time-evolution of the tomahawk state, a special state which is robust against thermal noise, and show that it does not evolve according to the usual Markovian dynamics. Finally, we show that the two-time-slot squeezed-statetomahawk-state transformation, recently proposed as a practical scheme for transforming a squeezed state into a tomahawk state, is in fact non-Markovian. Our results have important practical implications for the realization of quantum continuous variable systems in thermal environments."}

{"text":"\nWe present a statistical mechanics approach to the problem of surface adsorption and desorption of simple molecules. We focus on the problem of H$_2$O on MgO (001), at low coverage, as a model system. The approach is based on the Ab initio determination of the total free energy of the system, by means of a simple and general algorithm. The main practical difficulty is the evaluation of the free energy of the adsorbate, which requires the solution of the Schur equation. We describe a simple and efficient algorithm, based on the use of the variational method, which can be applied to any system, and which is demonstrated here for the case of H$_2$O on MgO (001). The results are in good agreement with available experimental data, and also provide a good description of the more difficult case of coverage below one monolayer. The approach provides a general and simple framework for the statistical mechanics description of surface processes, which is based on the direct evaluation of the free energy of the system."}
{"text":"\n\nWe report on a project to measure, and subsequently understand, the backaction of a quantum measurement on a macroscopic quantum system. Our experimental system is an ultracold atomic gas, a system in which the measurement backaction is very small and, therefore, easy to observe. We have developed a scheme to make a quantum-mechanical measurement on the atomic gas and to detect the resulting backaction. We have applied this scheme to measure the backaction of a density measurement and a three-dimensional position measurement. In addition, we have developed a theory that successfully describes our measurements, thereby confirming the basic conceptual framework of our approach. The theory also enables us to extract the backaction coefficients for our measurements, which are in good agreement with theoretical predictions. Our results therefore constitute a rigorous test of quantum theory, in particular of the decoherence approach to quantum measurement. Our scheme is also a viable route to the experimental study of the dynamics of quantum measurement backaction."}

{"text":"\n\nWe have performed a systematic computation for the ab initio melting curve of molybdenum using the phase coexistence method within the framework of the generalized mean field theory. The total energy is given by the sum of the total atomic energy, the total internal energy, and the total interaction energy between different atom types. Within the framework of the generalized mean field theory, the total internal energy and the total interaction energy can be obtained by solving the generalized mean field equations with the help of the Hartree-Fock auxiliary basis sets. The major challenge in our computation is to keep the computational occupation numbers close to one during the whole melting process in order to obtain a smooth melting curve. This requires an accurate computation of the energy derivative with respect to the occupation numbers. To this end, the virtual atoms method is employed in our computation to evaluate the energy derivative. Our computation shows a good agreement with the available experimental data."}
{"text":"\nWe motivate and develop a general class of Brantian gravity theories inspired by the Horava-Lifshitz formulation of General Relativity. In these theories the geometric properties of the underlying Braneworld are related to the dynamics of a massive vector field coupled to the gravitational field. We show that in this framework the role of resonances is crucial in order to generate a dynamically stable spacetime. Within this picture we formulate a version of Horava-Lifshitz gravity inspired by the work of Grisaru and Trevi\u00f1o (GrT) where the role of a special kind of resonances, which we dub synergetic resonances, is essential in order to generate a dynamically stable spacetime. We show that, in the framework of our gravity theory, synergetic resonances can be identified with the submanifolds associated with the eigenvalues of a certain matrix. We analyze the dynamical properties of our theory in the presence of synergetic resonances and we show that, in this case, the theory is stable and possesses a unique, dynamically stable, ground state. We show that synergetic resonances can be understood as theogenetic entities and we analyze their role in the process of spacetime evolution. We finally comment on the possible physical meanings of synergetic resonances and we discuss the connection of our work with the work of Buchdahl, Khronopoulou and Liu."}
{"text":"\n\nWe study the statistical and dynamical properties of the square dimer model on a lattice, a simple model intended to capture the essential features of realistic two-dimensional lattices. We find that the model has a unique ground state for a large range of lattice constants, provided that the ratio of the hopping parameters is equal to a critical value. We determine this critical value analytically for the case of equal hopping parameters, and find it to be proportional to the ratio of the cube of the lattice constant to the square of the linear dimension. For lattices with a non-equal ratio of hopping parameters, we obtain the ground state numerically, and show that it has a very simple structure. We also investigate the localization of vacancies in this model, both in the ground state and after a local quench, and find a strong dependence of the critical density on the details of the lattice. Our results suggest that the square dimer model is capable of supporting long-lived vacancy islands, which may be relevant to the theory of glassy systems."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider a probabilistic model of a resource-constrained scheduled system, in which jobs arrive according to a Poisson process and have a random service demand. The scheduling policy is based on the concept of admissible scheduling, which was introduced by D.34 The system is adversarial: the scheduler wishes to minimize the variance of the sojourn time of the jobs subject to the constraint that the jobs do not wait too long. The analysis of the system reveals a connection with the probabilistic notion of anonymity, which was introduced by A.5 An anonymous process is one for which the distribution of the number of distinct elements in a sample is the same as the distribution of the number of distinct elements in the whole process. We show that a scheduler is admissible if and only if it preserves anonymity. We then show that any probabilistic scheduling policy that preserves anonymity has a deterministic equivalent that is admissible. As a by-product, we show that the deterministic restriction of an admissible probabilistic scheduling policy is itself admissible."}
{"text":"\nWe present an analysis of the impact of inhomogeneities in the Universe on the fitting problem. We show that the probability distribution of the measurements can be non-Gaussian even if the true distribution is Gaussian, provided that the measurements are sufficiently inhomogeneously spaced in space. We analyze this effect for different choices of the probability distribution of the noise, and show that in the case of a uniform noise distribution the effect is most severe, leading to a significant degradation of the statistical significance. On the other hand, if the noise distribution is peaked on small scales, the impact of the inhomogeneities is negligible. We analyze the optimal distribution of the measurements for a given noise distribution, and show that for a Gaussian noise distribution the optimal distribution is a highly non-uniform one, while for a Laplace noise distribution the optimal distribution is very uniform. We finally propose a simple method to reduce the impact of the inhomogeneities, which consists in performing a spatial binning of the data."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider random walks on partitions that are obtained by adding finitely many rectangles of random sizes to a fixed partition. Such walks are well-defined despite the absence of paths in general geometric structures. As a limit, we consider diffusions on infinite-dimensional Euclidean spaces. For such diffusions, the reflection principle holds true, and the fraction of the diffusional volume that is located outside the bounding box of the corresponding random partition tends to one in the limit. We show that such random walks on partitions share many of the properties of random walks on trees, including a definition of the Markov chain associated with the random walk and a rigorous proof of the law of large numbers for the random walk. We show that the volume of the diffusional region of such diffusions tends to the volume of the convex hull of the random partition in the limit. This has implications for the problem of random walks on geometric structures that are not well-defined as path spaces."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present here results of a systematic study of the H$_{2}$D^{+}$ line in proto-planetary disks. Our data set consists of 19 disks observed with ALMA at 1.3 mm, 8 of which are new detections. We derive basic properties such as the line flux, width, and derived molecular abundance. We find that the H$_{2}$D^{+}$ line fluxes are correlated with the disk accretion rate, but not with the disk mass. The line width is anti-correlated with the disk mass, but not with the accretion rate. We have developed a model to explain these relationships. We find that the H$_{2}$D^{+}$ line in disks arises from discrete sources, which are likely to be embedded in the disk rather than above it. The observed correlation of the line with the accretion rate can be explained if the rate of source formation is proportional to the accretion rate. We find that the anti-correlation of the line width with disk mass can be explained if the size of the sources decreases with increasing disk mass. Our model further predicts that the line flux should decrease with increasing disk mass, which is in agreement with our data except for a few outliers. We discuss the implications of our model for the chemical and physical structure of proto-planetary disks."}
{"text":"\n\nWe report on a new method to prepare ultracold cesium Feshbach molecules. First, a magneto-optical trap is filled with cesium atoms. Next, a weak avoided crossing between the two cesium atoms in the trap is induced by a Feshbach resonance. The result is a strong reduction of the trap-center molecular density, in analogy to a Feshbach resonance for atomic pairs. The reduction of the molecular density can be used to reach the conditions for strong bound-state cooling, in contrast to previous methods that rely on unbound-state cooling. We show that the cooling efficiency can be improved by a factor of three using the new method. We also present a scheme to produce a pure molecular gas, which is essential for obtaining high-quality molecular spectra. We demonstrate a high degree of control over the molecular dynamics by a variable Feshbach resonance, and our scheme is applicable to a large class of molecules. We observe clear signatures of molecular bound states, and we measure the molecular energy distribution as a function of the Feshbach resonance strength. Our results open the route to a precise determination of the molecular binding energy, and they lay the foundation for precision molecular spectroscopy."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider a fermionic system of identical weakly interacting fermions arranged in a lattice structure and subject to a constant mutual repulsion. The repulsion between fermions of the same chirality is stronger than that between fermions of opposite chirality. In a certain range of densities, the system at zero temperature is in a unique state of quasi-phase equilibrium, with a particular distribution of chiralities, and the phase shift between adjacent lattice sites is a constant multiple of $\\pi$. We show that the symmetry of the lattice is a necessary and sufficient condition for such a state to exist, and we evaluate the range of densities for which the state is stable. Within this range, the state is robust against changes in the magnitude of the repulsion. We also show that the stability range is very wide if the interaction is relatively strong, and that it is very narrow if the interaction is relatively weak. For densities outside the stability range, the system is in a state of phase separation, with different chiralities localizing in different regions of the lattice. We discuss the possible physical realizations of our model."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a new approach to the study of exoplanet atmospheres, based on the dynamics of the atmosphere.

We derive a dimensionless quantity that is related to the molecular density and the square of the wind velocity, and show that this quantity is proportional to the nutrient supply rate. We show that this result can be used to constrain the molecular composition. We then derive a simple model that relates the rotation rate of an exoplanet to the molecular composition of its atmosphere. The model is evaluated using a simple two-layer model atmosphere. We show that this model can be used to derive the relative abundance of molecules with different molecular weights. We also show that the model can be used to study the effects of changing the planetary rotation rate, and of adding a non-equilibrium component to the atmosphere. We finally discuss the limitations of the model, and how it can be extended to more complex atmospheres."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a semi-analytic model to study the evolution of supernovae (SNe) in wind bubbles around Wolf-Rayet stars. We derive a set of coupled equations for the bubble's inner and outer surfaces, the SN's center, and the cool-down history of the SN. We solve the set of coupled equations analytically and obtain a closed form for the bubble's volume and the SN's temperature as functions of the SN's radius. We use the model to study the evolution of SNe in non-rotating wind bubbles around Wolf-Rayet stars. We find that the SN's growth is always faster than the bubble's expansion. As a result, the SN is likely to fill the bubble and reach its photosphere earlier than the bubble's evolution would suggest. We also analyze the effects of the SN's torque on the bubble's evolution. We find that a SN with a torque below a certain threshold will not be able to drive the bubble's expansion and will remain trapped inside the bubble. We discuss our results in the framework of recent observations of SN 1987A and SN 1999em."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present Spitzer photometric and spectroscopic observations of the nearby late-type galaxy NGC 3621, in which a low-mass active galactic nucleus (AGN) was previously identified in X-ray observations. Our main goals were to investigate the nature of the ionization source and the gas distribution in the nuclear region. We find that the ionization structure is very similar to that in the well-studied low-mass AGN NGC 5128. The ionization is slightly extended along the PA ~ 80 deg in the direction to the counterpart galaxy NGC 3622. The gas distribution is very clumpy and the gas is distributed in a few clumps along the PA ~ 80 deg, in agreement with the ionization structure. The gas kinematics shows that the gas in the nuclear region is stationary, and the gas in the outskirts is expanding with a velocity of 11 km s^-1. We discuss the nature of the ionization source and gas distribution in the light of the nuclear morphology and kinematics, and suggest that the observed properties are consistent with a low-mass nuclear accretion phase."}
{"text":"\nWe present a study of a large sample of galaxies in the COSMOS field, selected to be nearly invisible in the observed optical and NIR bands, with the aim of gleaning information about the properties of the galaxies and the intergalactic medium in which they are embedded. We find that the galaxies in the sample are, on average, twice as massive as galaxies in the local volume, but have a luminosity and star formation rate typical of galaxies in the local volume. The observed distribution in redshift space is well described by a model in which the volume density of the neutral intergalactic medium varies inversely with the square of the redshift. This indicates that the high-redshift universe is significantly opaque to hydrogen radiation. We show that this is consistent with a model in which the intergalactic medium consists of a small number of very dense regions, embedded in a large volume of relatively empty space, and suggest that the high-redshift intergalactic medium may consist of a small number of relatively massive filaments. We discuss the implications of this finding for galaxy formation at high redshift."}
{"text":"\nWe present new observations of the candidate magnetic white dwarf 1E 1547.0-5408 and the nearby supernova remnant G327.24-0.13, which together form the X-ray transient designated CompXsr1. We find that the white dwarf's spin-down power is consistent with a relatively long spin period of 41.3 ms, and we show that the accretion rate has decreased by a factor of 4 since the source was discovered in August 2013. These observations are consistent with a scenario in which the accretion onto the white dwarf has ceased, in spite of the continued presence of an accretion disc around the white dwarf. We propose that the supernova remnant G327.0-0.13 is the probable origin of the CompXsr1 outburst, and that the supernova explosion has pushed the white dwarf to the edge of the remnant, causing the white dwarf to begin accreting matter from the remnant. This is consistent with the observed radial distribution of the radio emission from G327.0-0.13, which is elongated along the direction of the white dwarf's orbit around the remnant. We show that a previously proposed association between the white dwarf 1E 1547.0-5408 and the young stellar object 1E 22594500-613 cannot be correct, on the basis of both the white dwarf's spin period and the relative motions of the white dwarf and the young stellar object."}
{"text":"\nEC-FORC: A New Cyclic Voltammetry Based Method for Examining Phase Transitions and Predicting Equilibrium\n\nWe present a new cyclic voltammetry (CV) based method, which we term EC-FORC (electrochemical-force optical reflectance spectroscopy based method for examining phase transitions and predicting equilibrium), for studying the thermodynamics of phase transitions in electrolytes and for obtaining equilibrium constants for redox systems. The method utilizes the fact that the presence of a phase transition in an electrolyte will affect the equilibrium between reactants and products of a redox reaction. We show that, using EC-FORC, the equilibrium constant for the reaction can be obtained from the slope of the straight line relating the peak current of the reaction to the square of the scan rate. We also show that the technique is capable of detecting the presence of a phase transition in an electrolyte and also determining the position of the transition relative to the onset of the redox reaction. As an example application of the method, we report the detection of a liquid-liquid phase transition in an ionic liquid electrolyte and the determination of the position of the transition relative to the oxidation of the electrolyte."}
{"text":"\n\nPower-law distributions in empirical data\n\nWe show that a large number of data sets in empirical applications exhibit power-law distributions, which have a power-law tail rather than a normal tail. This is in sharp contrast to the common assumption that data sets are independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) and have a normal distribution. To explain this phenomenon we introduce a new concept, the fraction of independent draws, which measures the number of independent draws in a data set. We find that this fraction has a power-law distribution, with the power being equal to the number of independent draws in the data set. Our results suggest that the fraction of independent draws is a universal statistic that is capable of characterizing data sets with a large number of possible probability distributions. We show that the fraction of independent draws is a good measure of the amount of information in a data set, and we use this connection to derive a simple formula for the fraction of independent draws in terms of the data set's information entropy.\n\nThe fraction of independent draws provides a unified framework for characterizing data sets that have a wide range of probability distributions, including the normal distribution. This framework has a number of practical applications, such as allowing us to design optimal experiments and to choose optimal statistical procedures for analyzing data. We demonstrate these applications by considering the problem of designing experiments to estimate a probability density function, and by considering the problem of choosing a statistical procedure for analyzing data sets that have different probability distributions."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a new method to analyze the stability and the different dynamical modes of solar coronal loops using the thermodynamic irreversible energy principles. We determine the stability domains and the mode structure using only the information provided by the total irreversible thermodynamic energy and the internal energy. We show that this method is equivalent to the method based on the total mechanical energy. We also show that this method is robust against changes in the external parameters, in particular the temperature, and it is consistent with the mode structure obtained using the velocity field. The method can be applied to any system in which the total energy is well defined. We apply the method to a large number of observations of solar coronal loops made with different instruments and we show that the method is consistent with the observations. This new method does not require the knowledge of the velocity field and it is therefore particularly suitable for the analysis of observations of solar coronal loops made with low-resolution instruments."}
{"text":"\nWe have developed a microscopic theory of meta-nematic transitions in a bilayer system which consists of a nematic and a meta-nematic liquid layer. Our theory is based on the idea that a meta-nematic transition is induced by the change of the spontaneous polarisation of the dielectric layer. We calculate the polarisation P of the dielectric layer as a function of the director n of the nematic layer for a large number of constellations of the two layers. The results are consistent with the available experimental data. Our theory predicts a strong increase of P when the director n is equal to the easy axis of the dielectric layer. This effect is especially pronounced when the easy axis of the dielectric layer is parallel to the glass substrate. We also calculate the director n of the nematic layer as a function of P for a large number of constellations of the two layers. Our results suggest that the meta-nematic transition is first order. We discuss our results in the framework of a microscopic theory of the dielectric layer."}
{"text":"\n\nA multi-wavelength study of z = 3.15 Lyman-alpha emitters in the GOODS South Field\n\nWe present photometric and spectroscopic data for 971 galaxies in the Goods South Field (GSO) with photometric redshifts in the range z < 1.5. We identify 36 galaxies as z = 3.15 Lyman-alpha emitters (LAEs) based on the HST image and the M31 image from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. The galaxy number counts in the GSO LAEs are consistent with those in the Goods North Field (GNO) and the Hubble Deep Field-South (HDF-S), indicating that the LAEs in the GSO are a representative sample of the general galaxy population at this redshift. We find that the GSO LAEs are significantly different from the GNO LAEs in terms of their optical morphology and colours. The GSO LAEs are optically less luminous and have colours that are, on average, slightly bluer and relatively less orange-shifted with respect to the GNO LAEs. The GSO LAEs are further split into two groups according to their optical morphology: smoothly varying galaxies and galaxies with discrete knots. The former group has colours that are significantly different from the GNO LAEs, while the latter group has colours that are similar to the GNO LAEs. We discuss the possible physical mechanisms that may cause the different optical morphologies and colours of the GSO LAEs. We also present the velocity dispersion and the optical-based classification for the GSO LAEs. The velocity dispersions show a wide distribution, with a peak at log (sigma) = 1.4, and are consistent with the results from the GNO. The GSO LAEs are further classified into four groups based on their optical morphologies in combination with their colours. The groups show different distributions in the velocity dispersion and the optical-based classification, indicating that the GSO LAEs have different physical properties and may have different formation histories.

{"text":"\nWe present an algorithm to correct the anisotropic magnification distortion (AMD) in the 3D galaxy correlation function. This correction is based on the knowledge of the galaxy redshift distribution, the observed correlation function, and the full 3D distribution of galaxies. We show that a simple correction based on the 2D correlation function can produce a significant bias on the measured galaxy power spectrum, and that a more appropriate correction requires the 3D distribution of galaxies. We present an efficient numerical method to solve the resulting 3D integral equation, and we show that this method does not introduce any significant noise into the correlation function. With this method we are able to obtain the power spectrum and the bias caused by the correction. We show that the bias depends on the details of the redshift distribution, but that it can be estimated in a statistical way. We also show that the power spectrum is only sensitive to the shape of the 3D galaxy distribution in a limited volume around the peak of the correlation. This result is consistent with the fact that the power spectrum is only sensitive to the scale of the fluctuations. In this sense, our result provides a physical explanation for the typically observed feature of the power spectrum that the shape of the correlation function is only slightly modified by the addition of small amounts of noise. We finally discuss the implications of our results for the detection of non-Gaussianities in the power spectrum."}
{"text":"\n\nThe Merger in Abell 576: A Line of Sight Bullet Cluster?\n\nWe present a study of the galaxies in the well-known bullet cluster, Abell 576, using the combination of optical images from the Hubble Space Telescope and the Chandra X-ray Observatory. The optical data are used to identify the galaxies in the cluster and to measure their positions and photometric properties. The X-ray data are used to determine which of these galaxies are in the cluster and to measure their gas masses. We find that the bulk of the gas in the cluster is located in the galaxies that are most centrally located, and that this gas is generally metal-poor. This is in strong contrast to the galaxies in the outer regions of the cluster, where the gas is generally metal-rich. We show that the observed distribution of gas in the cluster galaxies is consistent with a simple model in which the galaxies in the cluster have been formed by the merger of two gas-rich galaxy groups, and that the merger is still in progress. We discuss this interpretation in the context of recent theoretical work on the formation and evolution of galaxy groups and clusters."}
{"text":"\nWe present here results of a systematic investigation of the abundances of light neutron-capture elements in planetary nebulae (PNe). The PNe sample used in this work comprises 52 objects with ages on the order of 103-104 years, representing a wide range of initial chemical abundances. The observed overabundances of the s-process elements are found to be consistent with their production by slow (or fast) neutron capture in a large stagnant cloud, followed by mixing with the original chemical composition. We find that the s-process enrichments are only slightly dependent on the initial chemical composition. However, a clear correlation is found between the s-process enrichments and the degree of mixing, as expressed by the ratio of the abundance of the s-process elements to the square of the abundance of Fe. We show that this correlation can be explained in a simple model in which the s-process elements are produced by slow neutron capture in a large stagnant cloud and are mixed with the original chemical composition in a few major events. We also discuss the implications of our results for future work."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present the results of a detailed statistical analysis of the distribution of star formation sites in galaxies selected from the GALEX and CFHTLS surveys, in the context of the large scale structure of the Universe. We find that the clustering properties of these galaxies are consistent with a random field, with a power law correlation function and a correlation length of the order of 1.5 hMpc. This is in clear contrast with the large scale structure revealed by the distribution of galaxies in the field, which is well described by a Scale Free Network with a correlation length of the order of 7 hMpc. We show that the difference between the clustering properties of galaxies selected in the rest frame UV and the large scale structure can be used to determine the relative contribution of galaxy-galaxy interactions and of the large scale structure to the distribution of galaxies. We find that only 20% of the variance in the distribution of galaxies can be accounted for by the large scale structure, while the remaining 80% can be explained by the galaxy-galaxy interactions. This result has important implications for the theory of structure formation, suggesting that the large scale structure has a minor role in the distribution of galaxies, while the major contribution comes from the evolution of galaxies within groups. We also find that the migration of star formation sites with cosmic time follows a random walk process, with a random walk parameter of the order of 1. This suggests that the migration of star formation sites is dominated by the internal dynamics of galaxies, rather than by the influence of the large scale structure."}
{"text":"\nWe develop a shear transformation zone (STZ) model for amorphous solids that captures the essential features of the shear band formation and propagation observed in experiments. The model is based on the assumption that the amorphous material is weakly ideal plastic and has a finite formability. We show that the model predicts the development of a strain localization band that is in qualitative agreement with the observations of singleshear bands in amorphous solids. We also find that the model can describe the formation of multiple shear bands observed in experiments, if the amorphous material is not ideal. We show that the localization band in the model is a boundary between a shear band and an extended region of non-uniform deformation. Our model also predicts the formation of a central region of uniform deformation in the amorphous solid where the shear band has been pinned. We discuss the conditions for the localization band to propagate in the model and the effects of the internal structure of the amorphous solid on the stability of the localization band."}
{"text":"\n\nCo-orbital Oligarchy\n\nWe investigate the onset of cooperation and the stability of oligarchic regimes in the tragedy of the commons. We consider a system of co-orbital planets, where each planet extracts a renewable resource from its orbit. We find that cooperation can arise if the resource extraction rate is low. However, if the resource extraction rate is high, the common pool resource is soon depleted, and the system evolves into an oligarchy. We determine the necessary and sufficient conditions for the stability of an oligarchy, and show that the most stable oligarchy is one where the resource extraction rate is proportional to the cube of the population. We find that the most stable regime is a direct power-law regime, where the influencer has a power law distribution of the number of followers. We analyze the effect of the influencer's reputation on the stability of the regime. We also analyze the role of a gossip network in the evolution of the system. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design of cooperative institutions to achieve sustainable development."}
{"text":"\nWe consider the one-loop massless triangle Feynman diagram and obtain an analytic result for its contribution to the S-matrix. The motivation for this work is the recent progress in the computation of the leading pion pion scattering amplitude which is necessary to extract the pure triangle diagram contribution to the S-matrix. The key idea is to use the fact that the massless triangle Feynman diagram is a totally antisymmetric structure in the coordinates of the incoming and outgoing pions. The main tool to obtain the analytic result is the technique of the master integrals. The result obtained is exact and has a very simple structure. We also derive an analytic expression for the contribution of the massless triangle diagram to the S-matrix for the elastic scattering of an incoming pion beam with an atomic nucleus. The result has a very simple structure which allows one to extract the purely triangle diagram contribution to the S-matrix in the large N limit. The practical application of the result is to extract the triangle diagram contribution to the S-matrix in the large N limit for hadron-nucleus collisions. The theoretical application of the result is to investigate the structure of the massless triangle Feynman diagram."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present here an analysis of the X-ray emission from the central regions of NGC 4593, a barred spiral galaxy in which a low-ionization nuclear ring and a prominent X-ray cavity have been discovered. We find that the ionization structure in the ring is maintained by both a central ionizing source and the reprocessing of accretion shock ionization. The ionization structure in the inner 30 arcsec is well described by a formalism that assumes a Gaussian distribution of ionizing source functions. The principal components of the X-ray spectrum can be accounted for by a model in which the ionizing source is a 0.6 kpc long, 1 kpc wide radio source (centrically located within the bar) that is optically thick and able to produce a full ionization spectrum with a photon index of 1.4. We show that this source is able to maintain the observed ionization structure in the ring, but that the same source cannot produce the ionization in the inner 30 arcsec, in which the spectrum isdominated by a power law with a photon index of 1.9. We show that this power law can be explained by a model in which the ionizing source is an optically thin, 1.4 kpc long, 1.5 kpc wide region (centered 3.5 kpc from the nucleus) that produces an ionization spectrum with a photon index of 1.0. We discuss a physical explanation for the presence of such a source in the form of a radioactive ring. We also discuss a model in which the X-ray emitting region in the inner 30 arcsec is due to reprocessing of ionization from the accretion shock. We point out that the combination of both of these effects may be needed to explain the ionization structure in the central regions of NGC 4593."}
{"text":"\n\nWe study the large-scale behavior of viscoelastic flows in simple geometries. We show that a flow in a long cylindrical tube will display super-diffusive behavior, with a coefficient of diffusion that decreases with the reciprocal of the Deborah number. We show that this is due to the combined effects of shear and extension on the flow, and that the super-diffusive exponent depends on the physical properties of the fluid, in particular on the ratio of the shear and extension viscosity. In the limit of a large Deborah number, the flow develops a solid-like behavior, with a strain-rate dependent viscosity, and a dilatancy that depends on the sign of the shear modulus. The spatial structure of the flow is governed by the evolution of a Deborah number field, which is shown to be related to the large-scale structure of the flow through an extra stress-strain relation. In addition, the local structure of the flow is described by a decomposition in elementary volume elements, which evolve according to a local dynamics that depends on the Deborah number field. We also discuss the case of a viscoelastic flow in a planar geometry, for which we show that the large-scale structure is described by a vectorial diffusion equation, with a non-monotonic dependence of the diffusion coefficient on the Deborah number."}

{"text":"\nWe present a systematic study of the temporal evolution of the photospheric flames in 37 Type Ia supernovae (SNe) observed by the Hubble Space Telescope, in an attempt to understand the physical mechanisms that drive the different observed flame morphologies. We find that a large fraction (72%) of SNe display a flame structure characterized by a rapid initial expansion followed by a slow expansion or quiescence, which is often associated with the ejection of matter in the form of a jet. The properties of the quiescent phase, such as the flame size and temperature, are consistent with the burning of the Si-burning shell, and suggest that the energy injection from the radioactive decay of 44Ti is not sufficient to drive the flame, at least in the cases we consider. We argue that the rapid expansion of the flame observed in many SNe is likely to be driven by the combustion of hydrogen in an inner layer, and that this combustion stops once the hydrogen is exhausted. The ejection of matter that is often associated with the quiescence of the flame probably results from the violent mixing that takes place in the immediate surroundings of the burnt-out Si shell. We also present detailed numerical simulations of the flame evolution in the gravitationally confined detonation scenario, and show that the agreement with observations is poor. We conclude that this scenario is unable to explain the wide range of observations, and that the true nature of the Type Ia SN mechanism remains unknown."}
{"text":"\n\nWe investigate the evolution of the vortex lattice in a closed Rayleigh-B\u00e9nard convection cell when the temperature difference \u0394T across the cell is reduced below a critical value \u0394Tcr, at which the lattice is in a stable configuration. We find that the vortex lattice undergoes a series of rearrangements, which we analyze with the help of statistical tools. The critical value \u0394Tcr depends on the initial condition of the vortex lattice and is related to the convergence rate of the velocity field to its stable configuration. Below \u0394Tcr the vortex lattice is in a metastable state and its evolution is governed by the different instabilities of the vortex flow. We find that the rearrangements of the vortex lattice are not in general uniform, but are localized in space and occur with different time scales. We explain this behavior on the basis of the different time scales of the various instabilities of the vortex flow. Our results are consistent with the idea that the structure of the vortex lattice is determined by the interplay between the competing instabilities of the vortex flow."}

{"text":"\n\nWe present the first morphological study of the richest and most massive galaxy clusters in the supercluster phenomenon. Our main goal is to investigate the morphology of superclusters in order to get some insights into the mechanisms that formed them. We have found that the morphology of the richest superclusters can be described by only two parameters: the global cluster fraction and the local cluster fraction. We have derived a simple expression for the global cluster fraction which has a power-law behavior with a power of -1.6. We have found that this power is almost independent of the scale over which the supercluster is observed. The local cluster fraction shows a clear power law behavior with a power of -1.0. The combination of the two cluster fractions allows us to distinguish between different classes of superclusters, which we call \"global\" and \"local\" according to the dominant cluster fraction. Within each class we have found that the shape is well described by two parameters: the concentration, C, and the global cluster fraction, f_c. The C parameter is related to the correlation function and describes the global structure of the supercluster. We have found that the superclusters with a higher global cluster fraction tend to be more concentrated, i.e. the global correlation function is more compact. The local cluster fraction, f_c, is related to the clustering on small scales and describes the local structure of the supercluster. We have found that the superclusters with a higher local cluster fraction tend to be more isotropic, i.e. the local correlation function is more compact. The morphological study also reveals that the superclusters with a more advanced morphology (more concentrated and more isotropic) tend to be more massive."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present the results of a systematic numerical study of the galaxy populations of the 50 richest superclusters in the context of the Great Wall of Galaxies. We use the three-color galaxy number counts from the 2 Micron All Sky Survey to determine the star formation density in each supercluster, and compare the observed distributions with those expected from a simple model in which the clusters are treated as over-densities in an otherwise uniform field. We find that the clusters follow the model expectations well in their inner regions, but show significant deviations in their outskirts. We show this is likely due to the interaction of the clusters with the large-scale structure in which they are embedded, in particular with the filaments of the Great Wall. The comparison of the observed and expected distribution of star formation densities in the clusters allows us to probe the structure of the Great Wall and its impact on the clusters, and in particular to determine the relevant length scales. We find that the cluster-scale density fluctuations are consistent with a wall having a fractal structure with a correlation length of 3-5 Mpc, which is in good agreement with the distance at which the Great Wall correlations were first detected."}
{"text":"\n\nRedesigning Computer-based Learning Environments: Evaluation as Communication\nThe increasing use of computer technology in schools has led to the development of a variety of computer-based learning environments. In spite of the potential of these new environments to support learning, their current use does not always result in effective learning. This is due in part to the fact that the development of these environments has not been based on sound educational principles. In addition, the fact that these environments are new and often quite complex means that teachers often do not have the necessary skills and knowledge to use them effectively. In this article, we discuss the results of a research project in which we redesigned a computer-based learning environment, with the aim of making it more effective for learning. The key idea behind the redesign was that the environment should be based on sound educational principles and that it should be evaluated in terms of how well it supported learning. We discuss the results of our evaluation, which showed that the redesigned environment was more effective for learning than the original environment. We also discuss the implications of our results for the design and evaluation of computer-based learning environments."}

Our model is motivated by the observation that, despite the significant advances in wireless communications, the provisioning of high-quality services over wireless networks remains a challenge. In particular, we focus on scenarios where a service provider has to offer services to users with heterogeneous wireless communication capabilities. Our model enables the service provider to efficiently allocate network resources among users with different capabilities, while maximizing the overall service quality perceived by all users. The model is based on a stochastic reward model, which takes into account the service quality perceived by each user and the wireless communication capabilities of each user. We show that the proposed model is equivalent to a stochastic game, where the service provider and the users are the players. We analyze the game and propose a solution, which results in a system of stochastic differential equations. We show that this system of equations has a unique solution, which corresponds to the optimal allocation of network resources among the users. Finally, we validate our results through simulations."}

We show that the assumption can be replaced by an assumption on the number ofnon-trivial poles, which leads to a Residue Theorem for functions of several variables withan infinite number of non-trivial poles.

We combine visible and near-infrared photometry, obtained with the Kepler and Canada-France-Hawaii telescopes, with visible spectroscopy, obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope, to constrain the orbital and physical properties of the asteroid. We find that VD17 has a diameter of 1.3 \u00b1 0.1 km, a rotation period of 1.7 \u00b1 0.1 hours, and an oblateness of J2 = 1.01 \u00b1 0.01. We determine the mass to be (6.7 \u00b1 2.1) \u00d7 10^18 kg, the density to be 3.9 \u00b1 1.1 g cm^(3), and the surface gravity to be 3.5 \u00b1 1.1 m\/s^2. The temperature of the surface is inferred to be approximately 170 K. We conclude that VD17 is a contact binary, composed of two bodies of approximately equal mass, with a small companion.

{"text":"\n\nMultimedia Content Distribution in Hybrid Wireless Networks using Weighted Clustering\n\nIn this paper we investigate the problem of multimedia content distribution in hybrid wireless networks using weighted clustering. In particular, we consider the case in which different types of multimedia contents are distributed, each one characterized by different levels of importance. We propose a solution that allows to take into account the different levels of importance of the various multimedia contents in order to improve the distribution process in the wireless network. The proposed solution is based on the use of weighted clustering, a technique that allows to create virtual clusters within the network, each one characterized by a different weight. Then, the distribution of the various contents is performed by taking into account the importance of the content to be distributed and the weight of the cluster to which the node belongs. The solution proposed has been evaluated by simulations and compared with a benchmark solution based on the use of conventional clustering. The results obtained show that the proposed solution is able to provide a higher quality of service, in terms of multimedia content distribution, with respect to the benchmark solution."}
{"text":"\nLocalized Support for Injection Point Election in Hybrid Networks\n\nA significant fraction of Internet traffic is currently carried by content delivery networks, which provide a scalable solution for the distribution of content, such as popular videos, to a large number of users. However, this solution relies on the availability of costly, high-bandwidth connectivity, which cannot be guaranteed in the long term. In this context, a solution based on a hybrid network architecture, which combines a content delivery network with a peer-to-peer system, has been proposed. This hybrid architecture is more resilient and cost-effective, as it exploits the available bandwidth in an opportunistic manner. In order to minimize the traffic in the content delivery network, a number of peers (e.g., users or servers) can be selected to serve as injection points for content. These injection points are the only ones able to fetch content from the content delivery network and distribute it to the rest of the peers. The selection of the injection points has a crucial impact on the performance of the hybrid network. In particular, a localized algorithm, which takes into account the selfish behavior of the peers, has been proposed. In this paper, we propose a new, localized algorithm, which improves the performance of the hybrid network in terms of fairness and resilience. To this end, we consider a modified selfish behavior of the peers, which can be modeled as a game. By using tools from game theory, we are able to analyze the proposed localized algorithm and to compare it with the current state-of-the-art. In particular, we show that the proposed localized algorithm is a dominant strategy, which cannot be easily defeated by a selfish behavior of the peers."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present an analysis of a sample of ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) selected from the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS), to search for galaxies that are potential tidal dwarf galaxy (TDG) candidates.

We determine the surface stellar mass density of the ULIRGs and the LVF, and compare the number of ULIRGs in the sample that have a surface stellar mass density greater than the LVF to the number of TDGs in the Local Group. We conclude that there are no ULIRGs in the 2MASS sample that are likely to be TDGs, given the surface stellar mass density is a good proxy for galaxy inclination. We show that there are many local galaxies that have a high surface stellar mass density and are probably inclined, but they have not been identified as TDGs because their star formation has been suppressed by the infall of the Milky Way. This demonstrates that the population of TDGs is likely to be dominated by galaxies that are infalling, not by those that are escaping the influence of a large galaxy."}
{"text":"\nWe study the generalized $B\\to K^* \\rho$ reaction within and beyond the Standard Model, in an attempt to provide some theoretical context to the $B\\to K \\pi$ puzzle. We show that the generalized $B\\to K^* \\rho$ reaction is entirely consistent with the Standard Model, given that the $rho$ meson is a non-Standard Model pseudoscalar meson with a mass much smaller than the Standard Model would predict. We then discuss a number of different ways the $B\\to K^* \\rho$ reaction can be extended beyond the Standard Model. In particular, we consider a new $B$ meson that is a gauge boson, and that is charged under a new symmetry group $G$. We show that this $B$ meson can be consistently produced in the $B\\to K^* \\rho$ reaction, and that the new $B$ meson can be made to be a close relative of the Standard Model $B$ meson. We also show that this new $B$ meson would be lighter than the Standard Model $B$ meson, in agreement with the $B\\to K^* \\rho$ data. We also propose that this new $B$ meson could be related to the $B\\to K \\pi$ puzzle, in the sense that the new $B$ meson could explain the $B\\to K \\pi$ data without any new quark flavors or quark charges."}
{"text":"\nWe have performed a systematic computational study of the global potential energy minima of small clusters of (H$_{2}$O)$_{n}$ on graphite, for n=2-6. We use a new algorithm that is based on the determination of the optimal way to add an extra molecule to a given cluster, starting from the isolated molecule and ending with the largest cluster. The results show that the number of local minima increases significantly as the size of the clusters increases, but the global minima still form only two or three different classes. For the cases of n=4 and n=5, the global energy minima are occupied by three different clusters, which are further split into two classes, based on the symmetry of the clusters. The most stable clusters are either symmetric or show a four-fold symmetry. Our results are consistent with a simple model, where the addition of a new molecule to the cluster is associated with a certain number of dangling bonds, and the energy is minimized by forming either a four- or eight-membered ring."}
{"text":"\nWe present an analysis of the evolution of interstellar and stardust within the solar neighbourhood, based on the observation of more than a thousand nearby stars. We show that the local interstellar medium is a large-scale turbulent structure, and that this turbulence is responsible for the relative increase in the mass of small grains in the local interstellar medium compared to the ISM in the distant solar neighbourhood. We determine the growth rate of the small fraction of the ISM, and find that it is in agreement with the prediction of the localisation theory, according to which small grains grow efficiently in the inner part of the ISM. We also show that the growth of the small fraction of the ISM is compatible with a pure diffusion process, in spite of the large-scale structure of the ISM. In addition, we find that the large-scale structure of the local ISM contains a significant amount of stardust, which has been recycled from old stars to the new ones. We compare our predictions concerning the evolution of stardust with observations of old stars, and find a good agreement."}
{"text":"\n\nThe multiple viewpoints as approach to information retrieval within collaborative development context. \n\nWe are motivated by the observation that software development, due to its nature, has to deal with a huge amount of information of highly diverse nature. The information may be located in different places, in various forms and representations, and related to very different contexts. For example, requirements for a new product may be gathered from customers by marketing people, while development team gets requirements from product management and tries to make sense of them in the context of existing products and their limitations. At the same time, development team has to deal with technical documentation produced by the vendors of the used technologies, with the requests from the product management to adjust the product to the changing market, with the problems encountered during the development and with the need to document the product for the future maintenance. We observe that such diversity and amount of information require special approach to its retrieval, management and storage. We claim that the collaborative development context brings new requirements and challenges to the information retrieval process and suggest a new approach, which is based on the multiple viewpoints concept, to solve the information retrieval and management problems within collaborative development context.\n\nThe proposed approach is based on the assumption that the information about the same object can be represented from different viewpoints, and the information retrieval effectiveness can be improved by using the multiple representations. In order to prove this assumption we consider the example of requirements information management. We describe the architecture of the proposed approach and present the results of its evaluation."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider the structure of extremal black holes in D=5 with the two-term (SUSY) and three-term (Gauss-Bonnet) extractions. We find that the SUSY extraction contains a genuine (topologically nontrivial) contribution, which is absent in the Gauss-Bonnet case. This is explained by the fact that the SUSY extraction is an extension of the Regge-Muraki mechanism, while the Gauss-Bonnet extraction is an extension of the ailing Farmelo-Taylor mechanism. In other words, the SUSY extremal black holes are obtained by starting with a perturbative expansion which is already in a topological regime, while the Gauss-Bonnet extremal black holes are obtained by starting with a perturbative expansion which is not in a topological regime and therefore requires an additional non-perturbative ( topological) correction to generate extremal black holes. We also consider the horizon structure of the SUSY and Gauss-Bonnet extremal black holes, and find that the two cases are different. The Gauss-Bonnet extremal black hole is described by a (Spanish) solution, while the SUSY extremal black hole is described by a (Mexican) solution. We also discuss the relevance of our results for string theory."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present Suzaku observations of 22 active galactic nuclei (AGN) detected in the Swift\/ BAT survey, and find that they are all of the so-called \"new type\" of buried supermassive black holes (SMBH), which is characterized by very low levels of optical and NIR emission and by the presence of a obscuring torus around the black hole. We show that the accretion efficiency of the SMBH in the \"new type\" AGN is, on average, 1-2 orders of magnitude lower than that of the \"old type\" SMBH, and discuss the implications for the formation and evolution of SMBH and for the theory of accretion disc instabilities. We also show that the \"new type\" SMBH is less efficiently accreting than the SMBH in the \"old type\" AGN even at low accretion rates, and that the accretion efficiency is correlated with the accretion rate, which implies that the accretion disc is more stable than expected in the low- accretion-rate regime. We discuss the possibility that the \"new type\" SMBH is in a different evolutionary stage from the \"old type\" SMBH."}

{"text":"\n\nWe show that the spectral properties of the Laplacian of a complex network are very sensitive to the details of the network architecture. In particular, we find that many of the spectral properties of random walks on complex networks are universal, in the sense that they do not depend on the choice of the generating process. This conclusion is quite contrary to the claims of many authors, who argue that the scale-free architecture of complex networks is crucial for the appearance of long-range correlations in the random walk. We show that such claims are incorrect, and that long-range correlations can appear in random walks on any complex network, regardless of its architecture, if the network is sufficiently large. In fact, we show that the correlation functions of random walks on complex networks can be well-approximated by a simple deterministic model, based on a very small number of spectral modes. We also derive a simple formula for the spectral dimension of the Laplacian, which has important implications for the dynamics of random walks on complex networks."}
{"text":"\n\nWe introduce and study a new class of stochastic dynamic systems, named Stochastic Loewner Evolutions, which are generated by a finite number of independent walks on the plane, each walk evolving according to a Loewner pattern. We find a close connection between the theory of Stochastic Loewner Evolutions and the theory of StochasticMeanField systems. We show that the parameter dependent martingale inequalities for Stochastic Loewner Evolutions can be obtained as an extension of the results for Stochastic MeanField systems. Furthermore we show that the small noise approximation for Stochastic Loewner Evolutions is given by a system of stochastic differential equations with constant coefficients, which can be obtained from the small noise approximation for Stochastic MeanField systems by a simple modification of the measure. We give an example of a system of Stochastic Differential Equations with constant coefficients for which the small noise approximation does not hold and show that this example can be obtained from a Stochastic Loewner Evolution by a change of the underlying measure."}
{"text":"\nWe study a class of gKdV equations with rational interaction functions. These are equations in which the interaction function is related to the soliton solution by a translation and a uniform scaling. Such a relation is in general non-unique. We show that this class of equations has a natural basis of solvable asymptotic solutions. This basis is made of two types of solutions, both of which depend on a small parameter which is the ratio of the root of the polynomial in the exponential of the interaction function to the absolute value of the polynomial. One type of solution is a kind of Newton's method which starts from an initial guess based on the soliton solution and the other type is a combination of this method with a \"Variable Substitution Method\". The basic tools to obtain these results are a formula for the solution of a certain kind of gKdV equation with an exponential interaction function, and an asymptotic formula for the solution of a specific type of singular nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation."}
{"text":"\n\nWe demonstrate a novel effect of gravity-like potential in photonic crystal fibers (PCFs) that can stretch supercontinuum (SC) and trap light simultaneously. By forming a PCF with a germanium-doped cladding region, a gradient of longitudinal potential wells is created along the fiber length. Due to the slowly-varying periodicity of the fiber, these wells are approximately flat-top, with a depth that increases along the fiber. As a result, the fiber effectively acts as a series of discrete, transparent, and non-interacting potential traps along its length. In addition, we show that a thermal gradient can be used to create a gravity-like potential in a PCF, in which the thermal effects in the core and cladding are differential, leading to a non-monotonic variation of the potential along the fiber. We discuss the physical origin of this potential, and show that it can have several unique features that are not present in a conventional gravity-like potential created by a pure geometric variation of the PCF. The proposed gravity-like potential can be utilized to trap, stretch, and compress light, and can be used to create a new class of optical elements and components."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present observations of the optically-selected supernova (SN) GRB 060206, made with the 1.5 m and 2.0 m telescopes at the W.M. Keck Observatory. The light curve of the burst's afterglow, obtained over a monitoring period of three months, shows several episodes of rebrightening and fading that are interpreted as due to the decay of the SN, with a color index changing from -0.6 to +0.6. A 1-2 kpc scale spherical shell of gas, seen in radio images, surrounds the burst. We find that a model in which the shell is composed of the supernova's ejected material, with a single-zone model of the inner engine, can reproduce the observed evolution of the afterglow's color index and flux, with the engine's temperature and radius determined selfconsistently. We discuss the possibility that the afterglow's rapid fade-out after the first two weeks of observations may be due to the decay of the SN inside a small, central engine, with the surrounding shell glowing for longer due to a slower-evaporating reservoir of gas. Thus, the GRB 060206 afterglow light curve exhibits an unusual double-peaked behavior, which we show can be understood in terms of the interplay between the inner engine and the surrounding shell."}
{"text":"\nWe present the first three-dimensional measurement of the transverse-spin asymmetry (TSA) in hadronic Dijet production in the forward region, at a longitudinal momentum distribution of the Dijet pairs in the range 0.4<p_T<1.1 GeV\/c, and an average Dijet pair production rate of 3.3 events per \u03bcB\u00b7GeV. We use a data sample collected with the BaBar detector at the PEP2 storage ring, corresponding to 232 million $ppbar$ pairs. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that the TSA is related to the three-dimensional structure of the produced hadrons, in that it is larger for more compact systems. We show that the TSA is consistent with the hadron pairs being produced by a direct collision between the $ppbar$ pairs, with a TSA of $(0.09\\pm 0.09) \\times 10^{-3}$ and a relative TSA magnitude of $0.71\\pm 0.03$. This is in agreement with theoretical predictions based on the semi-classical Boltzmann equation. We also present evidence that the TSA is smaller when the hadron pairs are produced by an intermediate hadron, with a TSA of $(0.38\\pm 0.17) \\times 10^{-3}$ and a relative TSA magnitude of $0.91\\pm 0.09$. We discuss the results in the framework of the standard quark model and show that a quarkonia-inspired model with an additional quark degree of freedom can also explain our data without any fine-tuning."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a statistical study of the age distribution of star clusters in the Small Magellanic Cloud. Our goal is to extract information on the formation history of the Cloud, as encoded in the age distribution of its star clusters, in a manner that is independent of the chemical composition of the stars. To this end we use the idea of two-point statistics, developed in the context of particle physics, to define a new observable, the pair-age, which is related to the age difference between pairs of clusters. We find that the pair-age distribution is well described by a superposition of two exponential functions, with indices of 1 and 2, that is, a super-exponential distribution. This indicates that the age distribution of star clusters in the Small Magellanic Cloud has a power law form with an index of 2. A comparison with other galactic globular clusters suggests that this is likely to be a general feature of globular clusters in galaxies. We also show that the pair-age distribution is in good agreement with a scenario in which the oldest clusters are confined to the core region of the Cloud and in which the clusters age according to a spherical schedule, with a fixed age of 13.4 billion years. The model is in reasonable agreement with observations, but there is a slight preference for models in which the clusters in the outer parts of the Cloud are slightly older. We discuss this in the framework of the chemical evolution of the Cloud."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a high-resolution survey of low-redshift (z < 1) QSO absorption lines in the O VI band, with the goal of studying the physical conditions and statistics of O VI absorbers. We use the Millennium N-Body simulation to generate synthetic absorption lines at low resolution, which we then upscale to a high resolution of $\\sim 1000$ lines per galaxy. We compare the simulated absorption lines to the observed ones, and use the results to set limits on the strength of O VI absorption and the fraction of the intergalactic medium (IGM) that is absorbing. We find that the distribution of absorption lines is in good agreement with the predictions of the N-body simulation, and use this to set limits on the mean strength of O VI absorption in the IGM. We show that the fraction of the IGM that is absorbing is, on average, smaller than the fraction that is transmitting. We also study the physical conditions of the absorbers by modeling the O VI absorption lines with a simple collisional model. We find that the temperature and density of the IGM are in good agreement with previous results based on observations of the H I and CO lines. We also discuss the effect of dust on the O VI absorption lines, and find that it has a significant effect only for lines of sight (LOS) close to galaxies. Our results suggest that the O VI band is probably the best probe of the physical conditions in the IGM at low redshift."}
{"text":"\n\nESO137-001 is a gas-rich cluster in the galaxy M31. It is notable for its rich array of intracluster ionisation structures, and for the large number of ionising sources which are responsible for their creation. We present a census of these sources, based on a detailed photometric study of the cluster in the H-alpha band. The census reveals the presence of at least eleven sites of ionisation, with a total ionising luminosity of 2.4 kpc^2. The ionising sources are split into two categories: a small number of relatively bright sources, and a large number of fainter sources. The most luminous sources are associated with the cluster's two brightest galaxies, ESO137-001 and ESO137-004. The ionisation from these sources has resulted in the creation of a large number of ionised knots, or \"tails\", which are aligned along the cluster's larger-scale ionised structure, the \"dragon\". We show that the ionised tails are likely to be a significant source of atomic hydrogen, and possibly also of molecular hydrogen, to the intracluster medium. We estimate that the total ionising flux into the intracluster medium is 3.5 kpc^2 Gyr^-1, which represents about 10% of the cluster's total ionising luminosity. The low surface brightness of the intracluster medium, compared to the high surface brightness of the ionised tails, implies that the tails are relatively efficient ionisers, in spite of their relatively small number. The high ionising efficiency of the tails may be due to the presence of small-scale turbulence, which enhances the ionising effect of the ionising sources. We discuss the relation between the observed properties of the ionised tails and the theory of intracluster ionisation, and we draw attention to several aspects of the theory which require further investigation."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present an analysis of the enrichment of the Inter Stellar Medium (ISM) by metal-rich droplets and the abundance bias in HII regions. We derive a simple analytical expression for the abundance ratio of [M\/H] in the ISM and the HII regions as a function of the metallicity of the former. Our results show that the [M\/H] ratio in the ISM is below the universal value by about 1.5 dex for metallicities [Fe\/H] > +0.4, and that the [M\/H] ratio in HII regions is usually above the ISM value by 0.5\u20131.5 dex. We explain this bias in terms of the enrichment of the ISM by large metal-rich droplets that have formed and survived in the ISM for several galactic orbits, and that have not suffered significant further chemical processing. We show that such droplets can be efficiently formed by the accretion of metal-rich gas from the inner-rim regions of accretion discs around low and medium mass stars. Our results explain both the under-abundance of metals in the ISM and the abundance bias observed in HII regions, without the need of assuming different enrichment histories for different metallicities."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a theoretical and experimental investigation of the role of ion trapping in the increase of stimulated Brillouin backscattering reflectivity of a passive optical fiber. A theoretical model of a fiber with a distributed Bragg grating is described by a rate-equation-based kinetic model. We solve this model analytically to obtain the reflectivity evolution as a function of the ion trap time. Our model parameters are derived from a combination of experimental measurements and first-principle-based calculations of the elementary processes that take place in the fiber. We show that the increase of reflectivity is mainly due to the creation of a new distribution of ions in the grating, in addition to the one produced by the traps. This result is consistent with the substantial conservation of the average refractive index modulation, as obtained from measurements of the reflectivity evolution along the fiber. Our model also predicts a new type of dynamic gratings, which depends on the trap configuration and the ratio of powers injected in the pump and probe waves. These gratings exhibit a strong temperature dependence and can be used as a temperature sensor with a large dynamic range."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a chemical model for the distribution of water vapour and hydrogen in the terrestrial-planet-forming region of a protoplanetary disk. Our model is based on the assumption that the gas phase is chemically homogeneous. The gas-to-grain ratio is treated as a free parameter. The model is used to derive a simple equation relating the gas and solid phase concentrations of hydrogen and water. The equation has one parameter, the excess gas-to-grain ratio, which measures the degree to which the gas phase is supersaturated with respect to the solid phase. The excess gas-to-grain ratio is derived from an iterative algorithm that minimizes the free energy of the system. We used the derived equation to study the effect of the gas-to-grain ratio on the chemical properties of the disk. We found that the gas-to-grain ratio has a strong influence on the relative amounts of water and hydrogen in the solid and gas phases. In particular, we found that the gas phase becomes supersaturated with respect to the solid phase as the gas-to-grain ratio increases. The supersaturation results in a higher gas-phase concentration of water vapour relative to hydrogen. We discuss the model in the context of observations of protoplanetary disks."}
{"text":"\nWe study the phenomenology of D-brane inflation with general speed of sound. In this framework, the standard scalar field dynamics is replaced by a generalization that allows for a non-monotonic evolution of the potential and non- equate increments of the speed of sound. This generalization is shown to preserve the special feature of D-brane inflation, namely the ability to produce an exponentially large amount of visible matter through a subtle mechanism based on the interplay between the inflationary dynamics and the instanton generated superfields. We show that in this general framework the evolution of the bulk and of the Universe can be very different, in particular the effective number of bulk vacua can increase or decrease, in contrast to the standard scenario where it is always increasing. We also show that the correct bulk dynamics can be recovered from a phenomenological approach based on the assumption that the number of vacua is constant and that the dynamics is driven by a non-monotonic potential, provided that the correct relationship between the potential and the speed of sound is recovered from the bulk Hamiltonian. In this sense our framework is more general and flexible than the standard one."}
{"text":"\n\nWe investigate the Inside-Out Evacuation (IOE) of transitional protoplanetary disks by the Magneto-Rotational Instability (MRI). The IOE is a result of a negative feedback between the disk magnetization and the turbulent stirring induced by the MRI. We find that a sufficiently fast rotation of the disk results in a dynamic regime where the standard fragmentation models (FFR, FRF, or PC) are not applicable, and the evolution is controlled by the MRI. We analyze the time dependence of the mass-loss rate and show that it has a power-law decay with the spin-down time, which we attribute to the increasingly efficient stirring as the angular momentum is lost. Our predictions are consistent with observations of transitional disks in our Solar System and around other stars. We show that the inclusion of the IOE in a standard disk evolution model results in a faster transition from the gaseous disk to the mature planetary system. In particular, the accretion-induceddisk instability can be accelerated by the IOE, and the disk can be completely disrupted in less than a planet-forming lifetime. We also show that the inclusion of the MRI in a standard disk evolution model results in a faster or slower evolution of the disk, depending on the relative strengths of the stirring and magnetization. Our results suggest that the MRI is important for the evolution of magnetic disks, and has a significant influence on the properties of the final planetary system."}
{"text":"\nWe present a cosmological framework for the co-evolution of quasars, supermassive black holes, and elliptical galaxies. We show that the main regulatory mechanism for the co-evolution is the Galactic feedback which is able to halt the quasar activity in quasars which are hosted in galaxies that are being merging with another galaxy. We obtain that the number of quasars is at its maximum, when the ratio between the number of quasars and the number of galaxies is equal to the fraction of galaxies which are in a merger. We also discuss the possible scenarios in which quasars can re-start, due to the galactic feedback. We analyze in detail the dependence of the quasar activity on the total mass of the system, on the mass of the central black hole and on the number of mergers, and we show that our results are consistent with the hypothesis that the quasar activity is related with the dynamical state of the host galaxy. We also discuss the connection between the quasar activity and the accretion episodes of the supermassive black hole."}
{"text":"\nWe discuss motivations for a proposed research program to study supersymmetric sources, integrability and generalized-structure compactifications.

We shall consider the simplest example of a geometrically-motivated supersymmetric theory, and show how the structure of the resulting space-time relates to the structure of the underlying geometry. We shall also consider more complicated examples, and show how the ideas we develop for the simple case can be extended to more realistic situations. The second theme is the relationship between supersymmetry, integrability and the structure of space-times. We shall consider various examples of integrable supersymmetric theories, and show how the structures they exhibit can be related to the structure of the space-times they generate. We shall also consider the relationship between supersymmetry and the ADE classification of integrable systems, and the relationship between supersymmetry and the geometry of algebraic varieties."}
{"text":"\nWe present a cosmological framework for the co-evolution of quasars, supermassive black holes, and elliptical galaxies. The model is based on the assumption that quasars are fully ionized galaxies, in which the accretion of gas onto the supermassive black hole provides the ionizing radiation that is responsible for the transformation of a spiral galaxy into an elliptical galaxy. The model explains why elliptical galaxies contain only old stars, while spiral galaxies contain both young and old stars. The model also explains why the gas content of an elliptical galaxy is much higher than that of a spiral galaxy, despite the fact that gas is accreted onto the supermassive black hole in an elliptical galaxy. The model further explains why quasars are always found in elliptical galaxies, and why supermassive black holes are always found in the centers of elliptical galaxies. The model finally explains why the number density of quasars is positively correlated with the number density of elliptical galaxies."}
{"text":"\nWe report a theoretical investigation of the spin-dependent optical response of a spin-polarized electron gas. Two methods are employed: photoluminescence and Raman scattering. We evaluate the absolute value of the spin polarization and the Zeeman energy by comparison with measurements on a spin- ensembles in solid state quantum dots. Our main results can be summarized as follows. The spin- dependent photoluminescence is very sensitive to the mutual spin exchange interaction, which can be screened by a weak dipole-dipole interaction. We show that the relative strength of the two interactions can be extracted from the ratio of the two photoluminescence intensities. The sign of the spin polarization can be determined from the polarization of the photoluminescence. In the case of Raman scattering the situation is more complicated, because the spin- dependent Raman scattering process involves two different molecular vibrations. We show that in this case the intensity of the spin- dependent signal is not proportional to the square of the spin polarization, but rather to the absolute value of the spin polarization. Furthermore, the sign of the spin polarization can be determined from the polarization of the Raman scattering, provided that the ratio of the intensities of the two molecular vibrations is known."}
{"text":"\n\nWe report the detection of the short-duration gamma-ray burst (GRB) 060927 at z = 5.47, the most distant burst recorded so far. The burst has a fluence of about 2.6 k_W m^-2, and an isotropic-radiation peak energy of about 1.6 k_T, with a redshift-corrected isotropic-radiation energy of about 4.5 k_T. The burst occurs at a glancing angle of about 45 degrees with respect to the line of sight, and the intrinsic energy distribution is well described by a power law with a photon index of about 1.3. The burst is accompanied by a weak optical afterglow, which is detected by the WFC3\/UVIS instrument on board the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) with a depth of about 19 mag, and by the ground-based optical telescopes, with an observed magnitude of about 16 mag. The HST observations are used to determine the burst's position to be about 3 arcmin south-west of the Hubble Deep Field (HDF) source DR2227, in the direction of the Subaru Deep Field (SDF). The location is consistent with the burst occurring in a star-forming region, as dust and gas clouds are visible in the HST images. We find that the burst properties are consistent with those expected from a short-duration burst, and that the burst energy is small compared to known bursts at low redshift. We discuss the use of GRBs as probes of the end of the Dark Ages, and find that bursts with an isotropic-radiation energy of at least 2 k_T would be needed to be detected at redshift 5 and beyond, assuming a line-of-sight coverage of 10 percent."}
{"text":"\n\nQuantum Fields on the Groenewold-Moyal Plane: C, P, T and CPT\nWe study a class of non-relativistic quantum fields on the Groenewold-Moyal plane. We show that, although this class of fields is wider than the class of relativistic quantum fields, their statisical properties are in one-to-one correspondence with the properties of relativistic quantum fields. In particular we show that a non-relativistic quantum field has the same statistical symmetries as a relativistic quantum field if and only if the non-relativistic quantum field is the adjunct of a relativistic quantum field. We also show that the time reversal symmetry is not a statistical symmetry for a general non-relativistic quantum field. (The proof of this fact is different from the proof of the corresponding fact for a relativistic quantum field.)\n\nWe also introduce the concept of a CPTP transformation for non-relativistic quantum fields and show that, although the time reversal symmetry is not a statistical symmetry, the CPT theorem is still valid for a general non-relativistic quantum field.\n\nWe also study the generalization of the concept of a wave function to the setting of non-relativistic quantum fields. In particular we show that the idea of a wave function for a non-relativistic quantum field is meaningful only if the field has a certain statistical symmetry.

{"text":"\n\nWe present photometric detections of a warm dust disk surrounding the young star EF Cha, as obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope. This is the first detection of a disk around a member of the 10 Myr old Chamaeleon star-forming region. The disk has a radius of approximately 50 AU and a mass of about 30 lunar masses. It is slightly inclined to the plane of the sky, and its surface density is very low, 0.05 small solar masses per square AU. The disk is not edge-on, as the star's Rossiter-McLaughlin effect is too weak for a definitive measurement. We find that the disk's temperature is about 45 K, and it contains about 0.5 percent by mass of the kind of dust that is present in the solar system. The disk is optically thick, with a tau value of 2.5. We discuss the disk in the context of known disks in the solar neighborhood. We show that it is a member of a class of disks that is preferentially found in the southern hemisphere. We estimate that the probability of this disk having an embedded planet system is about 20 percent."}
{"text":"\nThe Cosmic Code Comparison Project is a collaboration between the Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the Institute for Code comparison in Cosmology and Astrophysics at the University of Chicago. The goal of this project is to compare the cosmic microwave background radiation data from the WMAP and Planck satellite missions in order to constrain the exact scaling of the amplitude of the first peak in the power spectrum. The project is motivated by the fact that the first peak in the power spectrum is thought to be a key indicator of the level of non-Gaussianity in the early universe, and so precise measurements of this peak are important for understanding the nature of the primordial fluctuations. The comparison of the two data sets will provide a precise measurement of the first peak in the power spectrum, and will also provide a rigorous test of the current models for the power spectrum. The project is expected to provide important constraints on the nature of the primordial fluctuations, and will also provide a rigorous test of the current models for the power spectrum."}

{"text":"\n\nWe investigate the effects of planetesimal formation and growth on the retention of different size grains in protoplanetary disks. We employ a hybrid algorithm combining Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations to follow the collisional evolution of grains and planetesimals. We find that planetesimal formation and growth is most efficient near the snow line, where a large number of small planetesimals can grow into large bodies by colliding with pebbles and staying in the disk. We show that this efficient planetesimal retention due to multiple growth events can explain the preference for large planetesimals over the distance of the disk, without the need for a radial dependence of the planetesimal formation efficiency. Within our model, planetesimals grow efficiently as long as their size is larger than a threshold of about 1 cm. Below this threshold, the number of planetesimals is in general too small to explain the large number of planetesimals larger than 1 km observed in exoplanet systems. We discuss how this threshold may have been reached in the disk by planetesimal formation and evolution. Our model implies that planetesimals grow efficiently as long as the disk has a turbulence intensity above a certain threshold, which is about log(\u03a9\/L) \u223c -1.5, where \u03a9 is the typicality length and L is the disk's radial extent. We show that this turbulence level is typical for the solar nebula and many other protoplanetary disks, and is therefore sufficient to explain the rapid growth of planetesimals observed in the disk."}
{"text":"\nWe present multicolor observations of the optical afterglow of the short\/hard Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) 050724, made with the Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT) at La Palma, Spain. The observations were triggered by the detection of the burst by the Gamma Ray Burst Monitor (GRBM) on board the INTEGRAL spacecraft. We find that the optical afterglow of GRB 050724 is characterized by a very red continuum, which is consistent with a host galaxy spectral type of M, and a mildly blueshifted ultra-weak NII morphology. The host galaxy has a radius of 1.3 kpc and is at a distance of 60 Mpc. The afterglow exhibits no significant brightenings, and is thus considered to be a steady afterglow. We determine the redshift of the burst to be z = 1.645, which makes this burst the nearest burst observed so far. We discuss the nature of the host galaxy and its possible relationship to the burst, and find that it has properties consistent with a disk galaxy. The burst occurred in a relatively inactive part of the galaxy, at a radius of 7 kpc from the galactic center. This burst is the closest burst to a disk galaxy observed so far, and it suggests that bursts can occur in galaxies which are not predominantly elliptical galaxies."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a model of feedback heating by cosmic rays (CRs) in clusters of galaxies. Our aim is to investigate the effect of CRs on the evolution of the hot gas component in clusters and to derive a physically meaningful prescription for the distribution of the CR energy deposition in clusters. We show that the kinetic energy of CRs is deposited in the hot gas component following a ballistic trajectory in the cluster, and we derive a simple expression for the distribution of the energy deposition in terms of the thermal and kinetic energy components of the cluster gas. We find that the energy deposition follows a exponential decrease with the distance from the cluster centre, with a characteristic length that is in agreement with the feedback length derived in a companion paper. The feedback strength is found to be proportional to the cluster gas temperature, with a power law index that depends on theCRs-to-gas ratio. We show that the feedback strength is in agreement with the prescription derived from the analysis of the particle trajectories, and we discuss the physical implications of our results."}
{"text":"\nWe present a complete catalog of 966 Swift gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) with known durations and spectroscopic information, obtained between February 2000 and March 2005. We show that, contrary to previous suggestions, there is no correlation between burst duration and energy peak distribution, neither in the total burst energy nor in the energy in the first 100 keV. When the data are split according to the burst energetics in the 100\u2013300 keV energy range, a slight correlation is seen between duration and the energy peak distribution, but this is due to the very small number of long bursts (with durations > 2 s) in this energy range. We also present an analysis of the properties of the 16 bursts with the highest energy peak, which represents less than 1% of the total sample. We show that there is no correlation between the energy at the peak and either the burst duration or the total burst energy. We discuss the implications of our results for the physical origin of the pre-Swift high-energy correlations. We show that the lack of correlation between burst duration and energy peak distribution is inconsistent with the suggestion that these correlations may be due to a single physical mechanism, and we suggest that more than one physical mechanism may be responsible for these correlations."}
{"text":"\n\nWe propose a mechanism for radiative electroweak symmetry breaking in warped extra dimensions. The physical picture is that theHiggs sector couples to a U(1) gauge group that is itself warped in the extra dimensions. This produces a non-trivial Higgs potential with two distinct mass scales for the Higgs boson, one near the TeV scale and the other near the electroweak scale. The mass term for the Higgs boson is given by a non-trivial curve in the warped extra dimensions. We show that for a large class of warped extra dimension models, the mass term for the Higgs boson is always quadratic, and so the potential is aMexican hat potential. We consider the consequences of this model for the Higgs sector, and show that in certain cases the low-scale Higgs boson can be very light, and the high-scale Higgs boson can be very heavy. We show that this model can naturally explain the \"miracle\" that the Higgs boson is so light. We also show that in this model, the Higgs boson can have a Standard Model (SM) Yukawa coupling, and so the Higgs sector can be related to the SM Yukawa coupling in the same way that the SM Higgs sector is related to the Yukawa coupling in the warped extra dimensions. This has the potential to provide a unified framework for understanding both the Higgs sector and the Yukawa coupling in the warpped extra dimensions."}
{"text":"\nWe develop a folding model to study the isobaric analog excitation in the framework of the effective two-body interactions. The model comprises a Hamiltonian that includes the isovector core exchange contribution and the three-body Lane potential, and a system of additional Lagrange multipliers that allow one to tune the isovector density dependence. The model parameters are related to the parameters of the effective two-body interactions. We show that the folding model allows one to reproduce the available data for the isobaric analog excitation in a wide region of the isovector density dependence. We also show that the folding model can describe the data for the isobaric analog excitation in a region of the isovector density dependence that is not covered by the available data. The folding model allows one to study the isobaric analog excitation in a wider range of the isovector density dependence than the effective two-body interactions. In particular, we show that the folding model predicts a strong isovector density dependence of the isobaric analog excitation in a region where the isovector density is small. Our results are consistent with the isovector density dependence being described by a power law with a negative power. We discuss a possible physical interpretation of the power law in terms of the isobaryon contribution to the state and show that such an interpretation is consistent with the available data. We also discuss a possible physical interpretation of the negative power in terms of the relation between the isobaryon and isoparticle contributions to the state."}
{"text":"\nWe present the catalog of galaxies identified as host galaxies for LIGO searches for compact binary coalescence events. The catalog was constructed by cross-correlating the LIGO strain data from the first and second observing runs with optical images from the 2 Micron All Sky Survey. We identify the galaxy distributions in the LIGO FoRces (LIGO-FROG) and the new Advanced LIGO survey regions (ALIGO-Vig), and use the correlation functions with the galaxies in the LIGO-FROG region to derive the most sensitive galaxy selection criteria for LIGO in the absence of detections. We find that the host galaxies are well described by a power law distribution with a cut-off at Mpc, and that the bulk of the galaxies are within 1.5 Mpc. We show that at least for the LIGO-FROG region, the number density of galaxies is not uniform, but is correlated with the distribution of matter in the Universe. We find that the host galaxies are likely to be log(M\/Mpc2) > 1.5, corresponding to galaxies that are on average more massive than the galaxies in the general galaxy distribution. We conclude that the most sensitive search strategy for LIGO in the absence of detections is to use the galaxy selection criteria derived from the LIGO-FROG correlation functions to search a volume equivalent to the LIGO-FROG region in the ALIGO-Vig region."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a characterization of the low-redshift (z < 1) intergalactic medium (IGM) towards the galaxy PKS1302-102 with the goal of assessing the relative contribution of baryonic and non-baryonic physics to the evolution of the IGM. We employ the australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) to measure the distribution of neutral hydrogen (HI) and CO(1-0) in the IGM. We find that the IGM in this direction is composed of two components: a smoothly varying component with a correlation length of ~7-13hMpc, and a second component that shows sharp peaks and filaments, with a correlation length of 1.5-2.5hMpc. The ratio of CO(1-0) to HI is found to be higher in the high-correlation-length component, indicating that this component is more baryonic in nature. The low-correlation-length component is likely to be due to the non-baryonic component of the IGM. We find that the non-baryonic component of the IGM is significant in this direction, with a peak value of log(OH\/H2) = -0.9 in the high-correlation-length component, and log(OH\/H2) = -1.1 in the low-correlation-length component. The ratio of non-baryonic to baryonic components in the IGM is found to be in agreement with the simple model of IGM evolution in which the non-baryonic component is governed by the Ostlin-Webb distribution and the baryonic component by themartini-aware model."}

We show how to use framed monoidal categories to model many different types of algebraic structures, such as vector spaces, semigroups, and probabilistic processes. We show that framed monoidal categories can be understood as a generalization of the theory of monoidal categories to the setting of \"_)-\" categories, categories in which the left and right actions of the category structure on the objects of the category are not necessarily equal. We also show how framed monoidal categories can be used to model many different types of topological structures, such as Filtered Algebras, Filtered Monads, and Fibrations."}

{"text":"\nWe present a catalog of 967 Hi clouds in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) observed with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Our analysis pipeline combines images from the HST proposals 13350.H, 13650.H, 13 951.H, and 14 246.H. The HST\/WFC3 images were taken through the F350LP filter, which isolates the H\u03b1 emission line at 656 nm. We use the Ha Century Survey to define the clouds, and the LMC's distance of 1.5 kpc to convert the cloud pixel sizes into physical radii. The catalog is the most complete census of LMC Hi clouds to date, thanks to the combination of high spatial resolution and sensitivity of HST\/WFC3. The typical cloud radius is 4.1 pc, but the sizes range from 1.2 to 9.8 pc. We find a total gas mass of 1.97 kM\u22c5yr\u22121 (68% of the total baryonic mass) and a total gas surface density of log(\u03a3(H2\/Mpc2)) = 7.92, 0.43, and 1.58 for the inner, middle, and outer LMC, respectively. We find that the mass of a typical LMC cloud is 4.2 M\u22c5yr\u22121, but the sizes range from 2.1 M\u22c5yr\u22121 to 8.9 M\u22c5yr\u22121. comparing our catalog with the two other main catalogs of LMC H\u03b1 clouds (one from the European Space Agency's Herschel Space Telescope and the other from the HST proposal 13 738.H), we find that our catalog contains many more small clouds, with radii of <5 pc. This is likely due to the higher sensitivity and spatial resolution of the HST\/WFC3 data, and it might indicate a presence of a significant number of very low-mass (i.e., recently formed) clouds. Our catalog will be an important resource for studies of the chemical and physical properties of these clouds, as well as for studies of the galaxy's chemical and dynamical evolution."}
{"text":"\n\nChronic social stress (CSS) is a robust psychosocial stressor that can induce anhedonia, a loss of interest in rewarding activities. We investigated the effects of experimental context on the development of anhedonia in male mice exposed to CSS. In Experiment 1, CSS was induced by housing mice with an aggressive conspecific for 21 days. Mice exposed to CSS displayed a significant reduction in preference for a highly palatable food compared to control mice, indicative of anhedonia. In Experiment 2, the same CSS protocol was used, but the anhedonic assessment was performed in a different experimental context. In this case, the consumption of the palatable food was not significantly different between CSS-exposed and control mice, indicating that the experimental context can affect the development of anhedonia. In Experiment 3, CSS was induced by exposing mice to chronic foot shock. Mice exposed to CSS displayed a significant reduction in preference for a highly palatable food, whereas control mice did not, suggesting that anhedonia can also be induced by a different type of stress in a different experimental context. In conclusion, the development of anhedonia depends on the experimental context in which it is induced, suggesting that it is not a unidimensional phenomenon, but rather a complex phenomenon that can be influenced by several variables."}
{"text":"\nWe present INTEGRAL spectroscopy and photometry of the outburst from the LMXB companion star to GRO J1655-40, a member of the HR diagram with an extremely wide gap between the ascending and descending branches. We find that the outburst energy is at least 6 kJ, comparable to but slightly smaller than the recently observed outburst from the Galactic globular cluster M55. The accretion phase in GRO J1655-40 is much longer, however, lasting about four times as long as in M55. We discuss the accretion mechanism responsible for these outbursts and compare the properties of the accretion discs in both systems. We find that the mass of the accretion disc in GRO J1655-40 is smaller by a factor of  \u223c 3-4, which probably explains why its accretion phase is so much longer. We also present a simple model which describes the observed correlation between the accretion burst and the orbital period in terms of a constant accretion rate (or a very small number of discrete accretion events) and a single frequency modulated by the orbital period."}
{"text":"\nWe discuss the problem of matching up the waveform generated by a full-scale post-Newtonian (PN) model of a binary black hole with that produced by the numerical-relativity (NR) solution of the same system. We show that this is a necessary step toward the construction of a hybrid model which combines the strong gravity and fast evolution of the NR solution with the weak-gravity and slow-evolution approximation of the PN model. We then derive a simple expression for the mismatch between the NR and PN waveform that is valid for an arbitrary NR solution and for an arbitrary PN model. In particular, this expression is shown to be valid both for the NR solutions obtained using the standard slice method as well as the NR solutions obtained using the streamline method. We use this expression to compute the mismatch for a standard NR solution for a non-rotating binary black hole system and for a number of different PN models, including the Churchill-Appleman-diniz, Teukolsky-Fetherolf-N incentini, and Herriott-Tanner models. We find that the discrepancies between the NR and PN waveforms increase approximately as the square of the PN mass parameter $m_{\\rm PN}$, and thus are much more severe for compact binaries than for wide binaries. We also show that for all of these PN models the mismatch between the NR and PN waveforms can be greatly reduced by a simple modification of the PN model which consists of making the radial displacement of the circles of constant latitude proportional to $m_{\\rm PN}^{-2}$."}
{"text":"\nWe characterized synaptic conductance fluctuations in cortical neurons and their influence on spike generation. We found that synaptic noise is telegraphic, with most of the conductance fluctuations occurring within a few synapses of the soma. We developed a simple model of synaptic dynamics that reproduced these experimental observations. We found that the synaptic noise had a large influence on the shape of the spike, resulting in a significant amount of the information in the spike being due to the synaptic noise. We then investigated the impact of synaptic noise on the ability of cortical neurons to produce evoked spikes in response to a stimulus. We found that synaptic noise can significantly increase the probability of evoked spikes, and can greatly increase the synchrony of their firing. We developed a model that incorporated a dynamic synaptic noise term that allowed it to be synapse-specific, and found that this improved the ability of the model to generate evoked spikes. We also found that synaptic noise can significantly affect the way that stimuli are encoded into the spike train, resulting in an increase in the number of codes that are representable by a particular spike train."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider statistical scaling laws for the roughness distribution in an unstable elementary particle driven by a small external drive, in the limit of large system size. The analysis is based on a stochastic interpretation of the roughness distribution. It is shown that a power law scaling of the statistical variance of the roughness with the system size is compatible with the possibility of finite size effects in the underlying stochastic dynamics, provided that the drive is not too large. The most relevant physical example is that of a small drive oscillating at the edge of a Hopfield stability window of a financial market. In this case, power law variance scaling may signal a Hopfield transition to a new stable state. We show that, if this happens, a scale invariant regime, in which the variance of the roughness remains constant when the system size is increased, ensues. We also analyze the case of a large drive and show that in this case the variance of the roughness is driven to zero in the large system size limit, without any finite size effects. Our results suggest that finite size effects in statistical roughness scaling are potentially relevant for critical transitions in financial markets and in other critical systems with small drives."}
{"text":"\n\nWe have synthesized single crystals of Sr3NiRhO6 and Sr3NiPtO6, two new magnetic materials with frustrated magnetic behavior, and performed a systematic study of their magnetic properties. The crystals are formally triangular lattices of magnetic ions, with rhombohedral symmetry and a very large number of structural symmetry elements. This leads to a very complicated magnetic behavior, with several competing magnetic orders which areinduced by different processes. The various magnetic orders that we observe are collinear, with a very large number of possible modulations, and non-collinear, with a much smaller number of possible modulations. We have also performed magnetic neutron diffraction experiments, which show a very complex magnetic structure, with a large number of different magnetic domains and several different magnetic orders. The magnetic behavior is very sensitive to the applied magnetic field, the temperature, and the crystal orientation, and in general is very complicated and not easily described."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a survey of results on the theory of wreath products of Lie algebras. This theory has been developed by several authors over the last decades. The motivation for the research is the relation of wreath products to the representation theory of finite and infinite dimensional Lie algebras.

The results obtained are a description of the possible structures of the Wreath algebra in terms of the primary and simple representations and a characterization of the regular and special categories of the Wreath algebra in terms of the stable range of the respective representations. As an application we give a description of the quantum enveloping algebra of a general Wreath algebra.

{"text":"\nWe present a comparison of the two prominent models for low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs): the accretion model and the colliding wind model. The comparison is made for the well-studied LMXB LS I +61\u00b0303, which contains a white dwarf with a relatively long spin period (41.2 \u00b1 1.2 min), a relatively low magnetic field (B_WD \u2248 12 MG), and a rapid accretion rate (up to 10\u2077 met per second), and is therefore well suited to test the two models. We find that both models are able to reproduce basic properties of the system, such as the observed accretion rate and spin period. The accretion model is found to be superior in describing the observed relation between the accretion rate and the spin period, and its ability to reproduce observations is improved by including a parameter that allows for a superposition of two different accretion states. We discuss our results in the framework of a simple model that describes the evolution of the system's orbital and spin parameters as a function of the accretion rate."}
{"text":"\nDetailed study of the GRB 030329 radio afterglow deep into the non-relativistic phase\nThe burst of electromagnetic radiation which accompanied the first kilonova event in a distant galaxy is a unique data set for testing models of radio afterglow emission. The afterglow emission from the event, designated GRB 030329, was detected by the Lick Observatory Radio Halos with Arcminute Microkelvin Sensitivity (LOWAS) array at a very early stage, while the burst was still in the asymptotic chirp phase. As a result, the subsequent evolution of the radio afterglow can be followed in detail, deep into the non-relativistic phase. We find that the afterglow decay follows two distinct power laws. The initial power law has a decay index of -0.9 and is accompanied by a blueshift of 8 Hz\/s. The later power law has a decay index of -1.1 and is accompanied by a redshift of 2.5 Hz\/s. The transition between the two power laws occurs at a frequency which is close to the peak frequency of the burst. The highest peak in the afterglow emission occurs at 3.2 kpc from the burst and is more than an order of magnitude higher than the next highest peak. The spatial distribution of the afterglow emission is consistent with a combination of a smoothly-varying background and discrete sources, with the discrete sources being responsible for the highest peak. Our results are consistent with a model in which the afterglow is due to a combination of out-bound and in-bound particles, with the out-bound particles being responsible for the initial power law decay, and the in-bound particles being responsible for the later power law decay."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider the thermodynamics of a fluid inside a trap, subject to an arbitrary external potential field. We show that the virial expansion is a useful tool for extracting the relevant thermodynamic information from the solution of the full three-dimensional hydrodynamic equations. Our approach is to cast the problem in the framework of the virial expansion, which relates the thermodynamic quantities to the kinetic quantities by a series of elasticity terms. For a trapped gas these terms can be written in terms of the thermal expansion coefficients and the isentrope. In this way we obtain the general formula for the internal energy, and for the total change in internal energy for a generalized cycle. This includes the work done by the gas on the trap. Our results agree with the predictions of the statistical thermodynamics for the special case of a harmonic-oscillator trap, but disagree for an arbitrary trap. For a gas inside a V-shaped trap the change in internal energy for a full cycle is zero, in spite of the fact that the gas does work on the trap. The special case of a harmonic-oscillator trap is discussed in detail, and our results are compared with the predictions of the statistical thermodynamics."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider the problem of characterizing the dynamics of a viscous liquid in the long-wavelength limit. We show that such a liquid can be described by a generalization of the Boltzmann equation in which the molecular degrees of freedom are expanded in a basis set that includes both symmetric and antisymmetric tensor modes. For a given symmetric mode, the symmetric part of the stress tensor is related to the symmetric part of the velocity gradient tensor through a symmetric projection, and the antisymmetric part of the stress tensor is related to the antisymmetric part of the velocity gradient tensor through an antisymmetric projection. The symmetry of the dynamics is thus broken into a set of distinct symmetry classes, each of which can be described by a generalization of the Boltzmann equation. The dynamics of each symmetry class is characterized by a single set of parameters that includes a relaxation time, a characteristic length scale, and a power law index. These parameters can be determined from the dynamical properties of the liquid, such as the relaxation length and the molecular viscosity, which can be measured experimentally. We show that the symmetric and antisymmetric dynamics are affected by different types of defects, and we discuss the implications of this fact for the long-wavelength dynamics of disordered media."}
{"text":"\nWe study transients from initial conditions based on Lagrangian perturbation theory in N-body simulations. We consider a simplified model of the solar system with only one massive body, the sun, which is described by thesame system of ordinary differential equations as the full solar system but has only one degree of freedom instead of six. The initial condition is generated by the random distribution of a large number of small bodies, the transients are caused by the slow evolution of the massive body and the gravitational interactions between the massive body and the small bodies. The small bodies are treated as an ideal gas, the massive body is treated as a point mass. We found the transient evolution is very sensitive to the initial condition, in particular the relative position and velocity of the massive body. We also found that the initial condition can be approximately generated by the solution of a simplified system of differential equations with a small number of degrees of freedom, this approximation is valid as long as the massive body is far away from the main resonances. The simplified system of differential equations is obtained by using the method of Lagrangian perturbation theory."}
{"text":"\nWe present a detailed study of the cluster abundance and the S-Z power spectra in a standard CDM model with power lawtiered clusters and a slow-rolling model with a positive non-Gaussianity (NG) parameter \u00e1.

The disagreement can be cured by an ad-hoc decrease of the NG parameter \u00e1 in the slow-rolling model. The resulting cluster abundance is in good agreement with the observations, but the S-Z power spectrum of the slow-rolling model is different from the standard CDM model in a qualitative way. We find that the S-Z power spectrum of the slow-rolling model with \u00e1 \u2248 1 is consistent with the observations, but has a clear signature of NG, which is absent in the power spectrum of the standard CDM model. We also study the early dark energy model with a non-Gaussianity parameter \u00e1 and find that this model predicts a cluster abundance X_200 \u2248 1.3, in disagreement with the observations. We find that this disagreement can be cured by an ad-hoc decrease of \u00e1.

{"text":"\nWe present a study in depth of the radial mode f0(1370), which has been observed in the Sun's atmosphere in the form of small-scale structures. These structures are visible as bright points in the solar photosphere, in photospheric areas of enhanced temperature and low magnetic activity. We find that the amplitude of f0(1370) increases linearly with depth in the photosphere, then remains almost constant in the transition region, and finally decreases exponentially in the corona. The frequency of f0(1370) in the photosphere is slightly higher than that in the corona. Our results indicate that the source of f0(1370) is probably close to the solar surface, in a layer several thousand kilometers thick, and that the energy is carried to the corona by the emerging magnetic field. We propose that f0(1370) is related to the internal dynamics of the Sun and could be excited by different physical processes in different regions. Our findings are consistent with a picture in which the amplitude of f0(1370) is controlled by the competition between the upward and downward propagating components of the wave, which is related to the temperature, density, and magnetic field distribution in the solar atmosphere."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a reinvestigation of the dephasing time in AuPd, from both the theoretical and experimental sides. We find that the theoretical value of the dephasing time, as obtained from a careful solution of the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation within the framework of the generalized Oh- inrathi formalism, is in reasonable agreement with the available experimental data, provided that the applied magnetic field is not too large. In this regime, the dephasing time increases linearly with the magnetic field. In contrast, we find that an excess enhancement of the dephasing time with respect to the theory is observed when the magnetic field is large. We show that this effect can be explained in terms of a longitudinal polarisation of the electron spin, induced by the magnetic field, which results in an additional contribution to the dephasing time. We also derive a simple expression for the dephasing time as a function of the applied magnetic field, which is consistent with the available experimental data."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present multiwavelength photometry and spectroscopy of the afterglow of intermediate duration gamma-ray burst (IDGB) 040924 and its host galaxy. The IDGB, which had a duration of  \u223c 3 ks, was followed for several days by the afterglow. The afterglow emission at early times is described by a power law with a wavelength-independent index of  \u223c 1.5. The burst occurred in a group of galaxies at a redshift of  \u223c 1.4, and the host galaxy is a member of that group. The afterglow is not only a signature of the burst but also provides information on the burst-hosting galaxy. The host galaxy has a spectrum that is well described by an exponential continuum with a spectral index of  \u223c 1.4 and a turnover wavelength of  \u223c 4000 nm. The burst and afterglow properties are consistent with the host galaxy being an unperturbed late-type galaxy. The afterglow was also used to derive the redshift of the burst-hosting galaxy. We find that this is the first detection of an afterglow from an IDGB in a group of galaxies. We discuss this burst in the context of other recent IDGBs with bright afterglow emission."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present resolved binary and multiple systems containing very low-mass stars and brown dwarfs. The systems were found by searching two deep, high-resolution magnitude-limited (fainter than 19th magnitude) surveys, the Two Micron All Sky Survey and the Deep Near-Infrared Survey, for faint objects that are close to or unresolved binaries. We present detailed observations of 21 systems that contain a very low-mass star or brown dwarf as one or both components. The observations include high-resolution spectroscopy, high-resolution photometry, and, in some cases, radial velocity measurements. We determine the fundamental properties of the components in the systems, including the temperatures, masses, and ages. We find that the very low-mass stars in our sample are, on average, more massive and younger than those found in previous surveys of very low-mass stars in binary systems. The brown dwarfs in our sample have temperatures, masses, and ages that are consistent with those found in previous studies. We find that there is no evidence that the brown dwarfs in our sample have been polluted by infalling material from their companions, despite the fact that many of the systems are relatively close binaries."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present an analysis of the distribution of satellite galaxies in a sample of twenty-one luminous galaxies selected to have satellite populations of interest. The sample covers a wide range of galaxy types, including elliptical galaxies, lenticular galaxies, and galaxies in which the central region is obscured by dust. We find that the distribution of satellites is strongly dependent on the axis ratio and on the surface brightness of the primary galaxy. For galaxies with a ratio of axis lengths greater than 3, we find a correlation between the number of satellites and the surface brightness of the primary galaxy. This correlation is consistent with the expectation that the number of satellites is proportional to the surface area of the primary galaxy. For galaxies with a ratio of axis lengths less than 3, we find that the number of satellites is inversely proportional to the surface brightness of the primary galaxy. This correlation is consistent with the expectation that the number of satellites is proportional to the volume of the primary galaxy. We discuss these results in the context of the hypothesis that satellite galaxies are formed by the accretion of primordial perturbations."}
{"text":"\n\nWe describe a new 60-cm-diameter radio telescope with a sideband-separating SIS receiver for the 200 GHz band. We have obtained a high-resolution, high-sensitivity image of the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC), which is the first image to be obtained with a commercial SIS receiver at this frequency and with this kind of telescope. We also obtained a 1.5 $\\mu$m image of the ONC with the SCUBA camera on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope, to obtain a comparison with the submillimetre data. We find that the SIS receiver has a detectability threshold that is several times better than a conventional double-sideband receiver, and the SIS receiver also gives higher spatial resolution. We have discovered a new interstellar medium (ISM) feature in the ONC, which is a bright, compact source that is resolved at the source position. We have identified this feature as a region with a higher-than-average density, but the origin of the excess emission is not clear. The new 60-cm telescope and SIS receiver can be used to search for submillimetre sources in the Galactic Plane, and can also be used to study the ISM and star-forming regions in more detail than was possible with previous technology."}
{"text":"\n\nWater's Hydrogen Bond Strength\n\nThe hydrogen bond strength of water has been a topic of intense debate ever since the first issuance of the ice rules in the 1980s. We have investigated the strength of the hydrogen bonds in ice and have found a strong dependence of the strength on the orientation of the bonds. In particular, we have found that the strength is highest along the ice diamond structure, and is almost as strong along the short diagonals of the ice rhombohedral structure. This strength is found to be consistent with the idea that ice grows in a way that is most stabilizing with respect to the thermodynamic minimization of the total free energy. The strength of the hydrogen bonds along the long diagonals of the rhombohedral structure is found to be much lower than expected from a simple bond strength calculation. We have further investigated the role of the azimuthal angle of the hydrogen bonds on the strength of the bonds, and have found that the strength is highest for bonds along the a-b and the a-e axes, with the a-b bonds being slightly stronger. The c-d bonds are found to be much weaker. We have also found that the strength of the hydrogen bonds changes sign at a critical bond angle, which is close to the \" optimal\" bond angle of the hydrogen bonds in water. We have investigated the anisotropic nature of the hydrogen bond strength by measuring the average number of H-bonds per water molecule as a function of the orientation of the water molecules. We found that the number of H-bonds per water molecule is highest along the a-b and the a-e directions, with the number along the a-b direction being slightly higher. The number of H-bonds per water molecule is found to be much lower along the c-d direction. We also found that the anisotropy in the number of H-bonds per water molecule is highly correlated with the anisotropy in the strength of the H-bonds."}

{"text":"\nWe study the simplest non-trivial composite Higgs model which is an extension of the minimal supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model (MSSM) by two Higgs doublets and two sets of quark doublets. We show that such a model can be made ( Philosophically speaking ) consistent and stable against the automations of the corresponding supersymmetric model by introducing a new Higgs doublet, in addition to the two standard Higgs doublets, which is always hidden in the MSSM. This hidden Higgs doublet is the \" fourth dimension \" in our title, which does not mean a physical dimension but a \" technical \" dimension in the sense that it does not appear in the physical states and therefore does not lead to an expansion of the physical basis. We show that this model can be made stable and consistent by an appropriate choice of the three Higgs doublets and the quark doublets. We solve exactly the relevant MSSM for this model, and show that the only non-trivial MSSM scalar which is not a physical state is the one that is hidden by the construction. We show that the hidden MSSM scalar can be eliminated by a small modification of the standard MSSM so that the only MSSM scalars which are not physical states are the two standard Higgs doublets. We show that the model with the two Higgs doublets and the quark doublets is equivalent to the MSSM, except for the extra quark degrees of freedom which are \" eaten up \" by the MSSM."}
{"text":"\nWe study the thermodynamic quantum critical behavior of the Kondo necklace model on a chain. We find that this model is exactly thermodynamically critical in a large parameter range, in strong contrast to its statistical critical behavior, which is never exactly critical. The origin of this strong difference between the thermodynamic and statistical critical behavior is traced to the non-Markovian nature of the dynamics in the model. In particular, the exact thermodynamic criticality is shown to be related to the existence of an conserved negative kinetic energy term in the free energy, in spite of the fact that the model is statistical critical for all $q\\neq 0$. We show that this conserved negative kinetic energy term is related to the non-Markovianity of the model, and that it is generated by an additional internal degree of freedom which is not present in the statistical description. The interesting difference between the thermodynamic and statistical critical behavior of the Kondo necklace model on a chain is shown to be a general feature of non-Markovian models, and it may be understood from the simple idea that the non-Markovianity generates an additional internal degree of freedom which has an energy that is not vanished at the statistical critical point, in spite of the fact that the standard degrees of freedom have zero energy at the statistical critical point."}
{"text":"\n\nInterface Width and Bulk Stability: requirements for the simulation of Deeply Quenched Liquid-Gas Systems\nThe statistical ensemble hypothesis implies that the thermal properties of a substance are related to the properties of its elementary parts. We have developed a general method of reducing the statistical ensemble to a sum of spatial composites, and have used this method to derive a simple relationship between the width of the interface between two immiscible fluids and the bulk stability of the mixture. The relationship is derived for the special case of a deeply quenched liquid-gas system, and in particular for the special case of a surface tension reducing agent. We have verified the relationship for a wide range of parameters by direct numerical simulation of the dynamics of the interface, for systems in which the thermal properties are well known and for which the bulk stability is well documented. The width of the interface is related to the bulk stability through a parameter which is a measure of the thermal segregation of the mixture. The relationship is very general and can be applied to any system in which the interface between two immiscible fluids is a relevant length scale."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a scheme for achieving strong atom-field coupling in a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) in an optical cavity on a chip. We show that such a system can be used to produce a rich variety of atomic behaviors, including single-atom control, independent of the number of atoms in the condensate. Our scheme is based on a collective mode of the light field, which can be achieved by using a broadband light source and a high-quality optical cavity. We analyze a scheme for generating such a collective mode by using a tunable laser and a Fabry-Perot cavity. Our analysis includes an exact expression for the light-field spectrum in the collective mode, which can be used for designing a laser-pulse sequence for preparing a BEC in the strong-coupling regime. We also present a scheme for producing a collective mode by using a superlattice of quantum wells as the cavity, which enables strong coupling even with a broadband thermal source. We discuss several practical schemes for implementing our ideas. Our results offer new prospects for atom-photon interfaces on a chip, which could lead to new kinds of atom-optical devices that are practical and scalable."}
{"text":"\n\nWe develop a theory of elastic scattering in graphene based on the Boltzmann equation for the wave-vector-dependent probability density function (PDF) of the elastic wave. We solve this equation with the help of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and show that the solution exhibits a strong anisotropy, which reflects the underlying crystallographic structure of graphene. By further including the effects of an external electric field, we study the influence of this field on the local elastic scattering in terms of the elastic wave-vector-dependent polarizability. The anisotropy of the polarizability further reflects the underlying crystal structure, and can be used to probe the local electronic structure of graphene. By further extending our theory to incorporate the effects of a time-dependent electric field, we study the dynamics of the electronic structure of graphene. We show that our theory can be used to understand the recent experiments on elastic scattering in graphene, and to probe the local electronic structure in a variety of nanostructures."}

{"text":"\n\nControlling for individual heterogeneity in longitudinal models, with applications to student achievement\n\nWe consider the problem of controlling for individual heterogeneity in models for stationary longitudinal data. We focus on the widely used random-coefficient model, and consider both linear and quadratic forms of the random coefficients. We propose a new model-based method, which we term the \"category-threshold\" method, for controlling for individual heterogeneity. The method works by defining a threshold on the within-person variance in the random coefficients, and then using the threshold to group individuals according to the magnitude of their within-person coefficient variance. We show that the resulting group-level coefficients are then consistent with the null hypothesis of zero mean and finite variance, against the alternative of constant mean and\/or variance. The category-threshold method has several advantages over other methods for controlling for individual heterogeneity. In particular, it is simple and flexible, allowing the researcher to use any linear or quadratic form of the random coefficients, and to set the threshold in any way that is consistent with the data generating process. We demonstrate the performance of the category-threshold method through simulation studies, and apply it to a study of student achievement."}
{"text":"\nAnalyzing Design Process and Experiments on the AnITA Generic Tutoring System\nThis paper presents the design process and several experiments that have been carried out on the AnITA Generic Tutoring System (AGTS), a tutoring system for teaching programming that is based on the Architecture of Integrated Technological Assault (AITA) architecture. The motivation of the research is the lack of generic tutoring systems that can be used by several subjects. The main idea of the work is to analyze the impact of different factors on the performance of AGTS. The methodology used is a mixed approach that includes experimental research, design of experiments, and statistical analysis. Several experiments have been carried out in which several factors have been manipulated, such as the language used for programming, the type of exercise, and the level of assistance. The results of the experiments show that the performance of AGTS is affected by the language used, the type of exercise, and the level of assistance. The practical implications of the work are the possibility of using AGTS for teaching programming to different subjects. The theoretical implications of the work are the contribution to the understanding of the design process and the experiments in tutoring systems."}
{"text":"\n\nEvolutionary Mesh Numbering: Preliminary Results\n\nWe introduce a new data structure for representing and manipulating polyhedra and other meshed objects. The data structure is based on the idea of evolving a sequence of mesh shapes, starting with a very simple base shape and adding complexity by iteration. Each iteration is specified by a set of local transformations which are applied to the current mesh shape to produce the next one. We show how to compute the convex hull of the current mesh to produce a simplicial complex which is the convex hull of the previous iteration. We implement this construction in a procedure, evolutionary_mesh_numbering, which takes as input a set of points in general position in the space of mesh shapes and an initial guess for the convex hull, and returns the unique simplicial complex representing the convex hull of the limiting mesh shape. We implement this data structure using two different programming models, a functional model using only immutable data structures and a more conventional imperative model using mutable data structures. We present results from a performance analysis of the two implementations."}
{"text":"\nWe present a method to reconstruct the alignment of the spins of visible matter with the real-space tidal field in the presence of dark matter. We use the two-mass redshift survey to measure the redshift-space peculiar velocity field and a reconstruction method based on the Karhunen-Lo\u00e8ve (KL) transform to extract the real-space velocity field from the redshift-space velocity field. The reconstruction is performed in an oversimplified model where the dark matter is ignored and the visible matter is treated as a fluid. We find that the spins of the visible matter are aligned with the real-space tidal field, in agreement with the hypothesis that the visible matter was concentrated by the tidal field. We also find that the mean velocity of the visible matter is 5% higher than the bulk velocity of the fluid, suggesting that the visible matter is slightly out of equilibrium. The level of departure from equilibrium is consistent with the hypothesis that the visible matter is transported by large-scale structure, but is not well described by the standard models of structure formation."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a model of malicious singularities, which are defined as singular points in a signal that are of interest for a malicious actor. A malicious singularity can be, for example, the start point of a peak, the tip of a peak, or the start point of a trough. We consider two types of malicious singularities, corresponding to two different types of malicious intent: a simple (unforced) malicious singularity, where the malicious actor is interested in a specific value of a signal, and an iterated (forced) malicious singularity, where the malicious actor iteratively forces the signal to a specific value. We show that malicious singularities can be detected by observing the iterated Laurent series of a given signal. We implement our approach in two steps. In the first step, we use a supervised learning approach to build a model that distinguishes between signals containing malicious singularities and signals that do not. In the second step, we use this model to classify signals containing malicious singularities according to the type of singularity. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on simulated data, and we discuss the practical aspects of using our approach on real data."}
{"text":"\nWe consider the problem of regularizing ill-conditioned square or rectangular matrix inverses by means of free additive convolution. The method is based on the idea of regularizing the inverse of a square matrix A by using the inverse of a related rectangular matrix B, where B is derived from A by adjoining a number of additional columns to the original square matrix. In this way the condition number of the inverse of the rectangular matrix can be made arbitrarily close to the condition number of the inverse of the square matrix. We show that the minimum possible condition number of the inverse of the rectangular matrix is equal to the condition number of the inverse of the square matrix plus a quantity that can be made arbitrarily small by using a large number of additional columns. This in turn implies that any preconditioner based on free additive convolution will be able to approximate a good preconditioner for any rectangular matrix to within a factor that can be made arbitrarily close to one."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a spatially resolved spectroscopic study of the gas distribution in the supergiant HII region NGC 604, based on a new catalogue of 30 single-dish detections of the CO(J=3-2) line in the region. The catalogue also contains 21 detections of the CO(J=1-0) line, allowing a determination of the ratio of line intensities CO(J=3-2)\/CO(J=1-0) for each detection. The resulting map of the CO(J=3-2)\/CO(J=1-0) ratio shows an almost exponential decline with distance from the central star cluster, with an exponential coefficient of -1.5+\/-0.1. The same pattern is also seen when the catalogue is divided in two according to the visual classification of the stars in the region, resulting in a 'compact' part with a ratio of typically 1.5 and a more 'halo-like' part with a ratio of typically 1.9. We conclude that a significant fraction (up to 50%) of the CO(J=3-2)-emitting gas in the outer parts of NGC 604 has a velocity too low to be able to escape from the region, even at the low density (typical log(column density) = 7.5) measured in these regions. We discuss this low-velocity gas in the context of a simple model in which the gas is treated as a perfect gas and the stellar velocity distribution is used to prescribe the gas velocity distribution. In such a model, the gas distribution is capable of producing the arc-like distribution of high CO(J=3-2)\/CO(J=1-0) ratio gas surrounding the central star cluster, provided that the gas fraction is at least 10% of the total (gas plus stars) density. The minimum gas fraction required is found to be slightly higher (by a factor of about 1.5) for the 'compact' part of the region than for the 'halo-like' part. We discuss the problem of low-resolution spectra of gas in regions with very large scale molecular clouds and the problem of continuum-level data analysis in the case of highly non-linearly broadened spectra."}

We find that the accretion mechanism in this object is likely to be inefficient, with the mass-accretion rate depending on the magnetic flux through the inner accretion disc. We discuss a possible physical explanation for the observed accretion behaviour involving the formation of a concentrated magnetic flux tube in the inner disc, which may lead to the development of a inner disc magnetosphere and a dual-disc structure. We find that about half of the magnetic flux is contained in the inner disc, with the outer disc containing the other half. We discuss the relative importance of the inner and outer discs in controlling the accretion process, and the consequences of this for the production of x-rays.

{"text":"\n\nTuberculosis (TB) still represents a serious health problem, being one of the main causes of death worldwide. The complex nature of TB and the emerging problems associated with the occurrence of TB are among the main reasons for the lack of efficiency of traditional TB control measures. It is in this context that recent efforts have been made to use mathematical models for a better understanding of TB as a disease and to design optimal control measures. In this sense, the classic paradigm of susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed has been revised and new concepts such as the influence of the spatial structure and the dynamics of the infection have been added. In this work, we present a review of the recent advances in the field of mathematical models of TB, focusing on the effects of the spatial structure and the role of nonlinear dynamics. We analyze the different models proposed in the literature, discussing their assumptions, limitations and results, and we draw attention to the most relevant aspects of each model for a better understanding of the disease dynamics.

{"text":"\nWe study a hybrid inflation model with both a non-standard and a standard component.

This can be used to generate data for statistical analysis of inflationary periods. We generate random data and analyze the resulting inflationary periods in terms of the average duration and the total amount of inflation. We show that the data is consistent with the existence of a unique threshold value for the non-standard component which separates periods of high inflation from periods of low inflation. We analyze the data in terms of a simple functional relationship between the inflation rate and the duration of the inflationary period. The resulting functional form is consistent with a threshold value for the inflation rate which separates high inflation from low inflation. We also show that the standard component can be used to explain the origin of the universal Gerbera SIMA plot."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a systematic and comprehensive study of the prospects of searching for new physics in future neutrino factory experiments.

For each search strategy, we study the prospects of both a search for a new fundamental neutrino property, as well as a search for the effects of a new physics mechanism which may alter the neutrino properties. We find that a future neutrino factory experiment can provide a competitive sensitivity to a wide range of new physics effects, including a 200% improvement on the current sensitivity to a new fundamental neutrino EDM and a 1000% improvement on the current sensitivity to the strong CCR. We also derive a simple formula which relates the required statistics to the number of detectors and the neutrino flux, and use this to derive an approximate figure for the number of detectors required to achieve a certain sensitivity to a new fundamental neutrino property."}

{"text":"\n\nWe present a detailed study of the coherent manipulation of molecular vibrations using femtosecond laser pulses.

We focus on the case of warm molecules in a gas, where the distribution of vibrational states is highly disordered. We show that the use of a femtosecond laser pulse with a properly chosen intensity, duration, and frequency can produce a well-defined and long-lived vibrational state, even in such a disordered system. We present a theory that allows one to predict the outcome of the FWM process for a given molecular species and laser parameters. The theory shows that the dynamics of the molecular vibrations can be used to selectively excite particular vibrational states.

{"text":"\n\nWe study a simple model of heterogeneity and increasing returns to understand how socio-economic transitions can arise from positive feedbacks. We consider a world with two regions and two types of agents, each of which is either rich or poor. Rich agents are more mobile and more productive, but they also have a higher discount rate. This makes it harder for them to invest in public goods, and creates an underprovision of public goods relative to the level that would be optimal for both regions. We show that the resulting negative external effects can create a poverty trap: a situation in which an increase in poor agents does not increase the total amount of public goods, and therefore does not help to close the wealth gap. We then consider increasing returns to scale in the production of public goods, which can arise from the increasing returns to education, for example. We show that if increasing returns are sufficiently strong, they can create a poverty trap even in a model without heterogeneity. Finally, we study a model with increasing returns, heterogeneity, and an optimistic belief about the benefits of hard work. We show that such a belief can create a poverty trap even in a model with perfect mobility and no heterogeneity. Our results suggest that positive feedbacks are important to consider when thinking about socio-economic transitions."}
{"text":"\nWe present results of a detailed study of the allowed mass orderings of a simple two-neutrino scenario, the so-called \"lightest- sterile-neutrino- is-a- Dirac-neutrino\" model. We consider all physically allowed mass orderings and use the so-called \" Designer Neutrino\" scheme to extract the required mass matrix elements from the conditions of the standard model. In this way we can derive the masses of the three neutrinos in terms of the fundamental Standard Model parameters and the neutrino masses can be related to the masses of the other elementary particles. In the mass matrix we find the small element (with a value of about 0.07 eV) representing the Dirac neutrino mass. We find that the mass of the lightest sterile neutrino is a multiple of the Dirac neutrino mass, with the value depending on the details of the mixing and the mass ordering. The Dirac neutrino and the sterile neutrinos can be assigned masses within the framework of the standard model without the need to introduce new parameters. We discuss the implications of this scenario for neutrino mass detection and for the question of the mass ordering."}

{"text":"\n\nAbstract\nLysozyme is a small globular protein that is found in animals, plants, and bacteria, and it is known to be a potent antimicrobial agent. In this work, we investigate the effects of three disaccharides, trehalose, maltose, and sucrose, on the structural and dynamical properties of lysozyme using molecular dynamics simulations. Our results show that the addition of disaccharides to the lysozyme protein can have significant effects on both the structure and dynamics of the protein. The most significant changes were observed in the hydrogen bonding network of the protein, which was affected by the addition of the disaccharides. Additionally, we found that the dynamics of the protein also changed significantly, with the most significant changes observed in the modes of vibration and the conformational space explored by the protein. The results of this work suggest that the addition of disaccharides to lysozyme can have significant effects on the structural and dynamical properties of the protein, and may provide a useful tool for the study of protein-carbohydrate interactions."}
{"text":"\n\nWe investigate the statistics of finite-time Lyapunov stability exponents for the standard map as a function of the parameter a in the equation. For each a we compute the probability distribution of the number of islands of a given size. We find that the distribution is heavy-tailed, with large fluctuations of the number of islands. We show that this is due to the strong correlations between the sizes of the islands. By considering the time it takes for the largest island to disappear, we show that the probability of this event is quite large for small islands. Therefore, large islands are relatively more stable than small islands. Our results are consistent with a model where the islands compete for space, and the growth of a small island is slightly faster than that of a large island.\n\nWe also consider the problem of detecting small islands. We show that if we only consider the largest island, then the probability of missing a small island is quite large. We suggest two simple methods to detect small islands with a high probability."}
{"text":"\n\nWe investigate the use of time-delayed feedback control for a flashing ratchet, a recently proposed experimental platform for studying autonomy and self-reproduction in non-living systems. A flashing ratchet is a periodically driven thermal ratchet that, through parametric instability, creates a self-sustained, low-frequency flashing noise. We show that a small time-delayed feedback to the driving force can lead to a rich variety of dynamics, including the ability to switch between different modes of flashing. We consider both symmetric and asymmetric feedback, and analyze the effect of varying the strength of the feedback and the time delay. We find that, in spite of the simplicity of the system, it is rich in dynamics, and we are able to generate a variety of forms of low-frequency flashing, as well as high-frequency noise and harmonics. Our results suggest that time-delayed feedback control can be used to design complex dynamics in simple systems, and can be extended to control of more complex systems."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present here a systematic study of X-ray flares in low-mass stars of the Orion Nebula Cluster. We find that the occurrence of X-ray flares in these stars is not uniform, but rather, is correlated with several parameters such as spectral type, orbital period, and the presence or absence of a surrounding disk. We have found a correlation between the occurrence of X-ray flares and the magnetic activity level of these stars, as indicated by the strength of the Ca II H line. The flares occur most frequently (with a probability of about 80%) in low-mass stars (M0-M2 spectral type) with a high level of magnetic activity (Ca II H > 3.5 km\/s). The frequency of X-ray flares in G and K stars is much smaller, with only a few events detected during our monitoring campaign. We have found no evidence for a correlation between the occurrence of X-ray flares and the presence of a surrounding disk. However, a trend is observed in the distribution of X-ray flare occurrence in the different orbital periods, with the flares being more frequent in short-period ( \u2272 100 days) stars. We find that the X-ray flares in low-mass stars follow the same physical mechanism as in solar flares, where a reconnection process in the corona triggers a eruption of the solar plasma in the upper atmosphere, creating a radiation flare. Our observations suggest that magnetic activity is an important physical mechanism that plays a key role in the evolution of low-mass stars."}
{"text":"\nFree Energy of Activation for the Comorosan Effect\n\nWe have developed a theory of the Comorosan Effect, which is the increase in the frequency of polarized light transmitted through a chiral plasmonic metasurface. The theory successfully describes the effect for a large range of parameters and explains the conditions for the optimal conversion. The theory also reveals the existence of a minimal energy of activation for the effect, which is a key finding that enables the design of metasurfaces that can switch from a state of no effect to a state of maximal effect with a small perturbation. The theory suggests that the switching is a first-order process and does not require an initial transient, in contrast to what is usually assumed in the theoretical description of optical phase transitions. The energy of activation is practically relevant because it sets a minimum amount of energy that is required to switch on the Comorosan Effect. We show that this energy can be supplied by a thermal source, and therefore the Comorosan Effect can be used for optical information processing. We also discuss the limitations of the theory and the effect."}
{"text":"\nWe present observations of very high energy (VHE, E>100 keV) gamma-ray radiation from the stellar-mass black hole candidate Cygnus X-1. The observations were made with the VHE sensitive imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope (IACT) ZTF-magnometer (ZTF-m) and cover a period of more than ten years, from 2007 to 2017. We find that the VHE gamma-ray flux from Cygnus X-1 is highly variable, with a peak flux density of  \u223c 4 \u2212 10 counts per detector per hour (ch\/det\/hr) and an average flux density of  \u223c 1.3 ch\/det\/hr during the period of observations. These values correspond to a total VHE gamma-ray luminosity of  \u223c 4.1  \u2217 1036 erg s\u22121 and an average VHE gamma-ray luminosity of  \u223c 1.4  \u2217 1036 erg s\u22121 during the period of observations. We find that the VHE gamma-ray emission from Cygnus X-1 is likely due to the accretion disc around the black hole, in agreement with the predictions of magnetized drum-up models. Our results suggest that the accretion disc around stellar-mass black holes is able to produce a significant amount of VHE gamma-ray radiation, even in the presence of a strong magnetic field, and that much of this VHE gamma-ray radiation is absorbed by the accretion disc itself."}
{"text":"\n\nWe study the dynamics of solitons in a class of self-defocusing quadratic (Self-defocusing Quadratic or SQ) nonlinearities which includes the Segal and Komorovsky equations as special cases. We derive a simple expression for the compression of solitons in a chain of SQ nonlinearities which includes a parameter depending on the length of the chain and the strength of the nonlinearities. We show that the compression is very fast for weak nonlinearities and the speed decreases when the nonlinearities get stronger. We analyze the conditions for the onset of a new kind of phase transition where the speed of compression goes to zero and the solitons stop. The theory is confirmed by numerical simulations in chains of Segal or Komorovsky equations with different parameters. We also derive a simple expression for the distance the solitons travel in a chain of SQ nonlinearities which includes a parameter depending on the length of the chain and the strength of the nonlinearities. We show that the distance increases when the nonlinearities get stronger and it tends to infinity when the chain gets long. The theory is confirmed by numerical simulations in chains of Segal or Komorovsky equations with different parameters.\n\nWe also study the interaction of a single soliton with a single SQ nonlinearity. We show that the soliton keeps its shape if the nonlinearity is weak and the soliton breaks into a series of shorter solitons if the nonlinearity is strong.

{"text":"\n\nWe present a study of the ionised mane of the Horsehead nebula (NGC 7027), which is located behind the meridian about 3\u00b0 east of the third magnitude star Procyon. We find that the ionised gas in the mane is significantly cooler than the non-ionised gas in the head. We have made observations with the aim of investigating the relative temperatures and the velocity structure of the ionised gas in the mane, the neutral gas in the head, and the gas in the comet-tail shaped structure that appears to connect the mane to the head. Our main result is that the ionised gas in the mane is between 1.5 and 2.5 kK cooler than the non-ionised gas in the head, as determined from the ratio of the doubly ionised carbon atom C+ to the ionised carbon atom C. This result suggests that the ionised gas in the mane is moving towards us and is therefore much closer than the non-ionised gas in the head. This is supported by a comparison of the line ratios of C+ to C and CO+ to CO, which show a trend of increasing strength with line centre wavelength. The strength of the CO lines is consistent with the gas in the head being at a distance of about 85 pc, but the C+ lines require a distance of about 50 pc. The relative velocity structure of the ionised gas in the mane was determined from the difference between the observed distribution of the doubly ionised carbon atom C+ and a model distribution assuming that the gas is at the same temperature throughout. We find that the ionised gas in the mane is likely to be moving at about 30 km s$^{-1}$, and that this velocity structure is in agreement with a model in which the gas is driven by the infalling ionised matter from the Sco OB1 association. We also find that the ionised gas in the mane is likely to be much less dense than the non-ionised gas in the head."}
{"text":"\n\nWe show that the prediction by sunscreen pioneer George de Verdalle that black holes are likely to be undetectable as such, because they are likely to be surrounded by a cloud of photons, has a simple quantum-mechanical derivation. We also show that a cloud of photons around a black hole is equivalent to the quantum-mechanical description of a gravastar. Hence, if a quantum-mechanical argument can establish the undetectability of black holes, it can also establish the undetectability of gravastars, and vice versa. We discuss a simple experiment that can discriminate between a black hole and a gravastar. We show that the Hawking-like term in the SE Raptor model can be related to the moment of inertia of the secondary object in the frame of the primary object. We also show that this relation allows us to reproduce the Hawking-like term as a sum of three terms, each of which corresponds to the moment of inertia of a different axis of the secondary object in the frame of the primary object.

{"text":"\n\nWe present photometric and spectroscopic observations of the optical transient GRB051022, which is a prototype of a dark burst. We find that the transient is composed of two components: a bright precursor, and a dark burst that is ten times more energetic. The bright precursor has been observed for approximately 70 ks; during this time it exhibited a slow decline in brightness, followed by a sharp fade-out. The total energy output in the optical band is 1.4 kJ, which is approximately one order of magnitude larger than the optical energy output of a standard gamma-ray burst (GRB). The radiative efficiency of GRB051022 is found to be 2.0%, which is similar to that of other optically violent transient events. The spectral shape of the burst is well described by a power law with a photon index of -1.1 and a characteristic wavelength of 5300 \u00c5. The extinction by the host galaxy is A_(v) = 1.4 kpc^2. Based on the observed phenomenology of the burst, we argue that the energy is deposited in a small volume, and is therefore not the result of a supernova explosion. The origin of such an energetic transient is still unclear."}
{"text":"\nA novel method for evaluating the critical nucleus and the surface tension in systems with first order phase transition is developed. The method is based on the evaluation of the interface energy in the presence of a finite surface tension and its numerical integration which allows the evaluation of the over-barrier energy as a function of the number of particles in the critical nucleus. This provides a clear and direct evaluation of the critical nucleus and the surface tension without the need of fitting parameters in a theoretical model. The method is tested on a model system of a first order phase transition between a liquid and a gas phase, and the results are compared with predictions based on a simplified model. The good agreement between the different methods provides strong support for the proposed procedure. The method can be applied to a variety of systems with first order phase transition and can provide a more direct and precise evaluation of the critical conditions for phase transition than methods based on fitting theoretical models."}
{"text":"\nWe study critical scaling and heterogeneous superdiffusion across the jamming\/rigidity transition of a granular glass. We find that the variance of the diffusion coefficients increases several orders of magnitude as the system is cooled through the transition. This increase is accompanied by a breakdown of the uniform diffusion coefficient field, with the largest increases in the diffusion coefficients located at the boundaries of the clusters. Our results suggest that at low temperatures the dynamics is driven by long-range superdiffusion events that can cross cluster boundaries, in addition to the local superdiffusion events that occur inside the clusters. We also find that the superdiffusion is faster on the boundaries of the clusters than in their cores, a finding that is consistent with the large increase in the diffusion coefficients on the boundaries. We show that the dynamics is well described by a model in which the probability distribution of the displacement jumps has a power-law tail, and the superdiffusion is driven by long-range correlations in the displacement jumps."}
{"text":"\nWe present observations of the kinematics of the protocluster condensations in the main cloud of Ophiuchus. Our results indicate that these condensations are moving with a velocity between 17 and 31 km s^-1, and with a dispersive velocity of about 1 km s^-1. We also find that the motion is compatible with a constant radial velocity with respect to the cloud but with a non-negligible velocity dispersion. We discuss these results in the framework of different scenarios for the origin of these condensations. Scenarios involving the infall of the condensations from the outside of the cloud are discarded, on the basis of the radial velocity and the comparison with the infall velocity of therils. We conclude that the most plausible scenario is that the condensations are conceived inside the cloud, with a minimum of interaction with the cloud itself, except for thevirialization and the removal of the gas at the periphery. This result is consistent with a picture in which the main cloud has a strong self-gravity, capable of retaining matter, and where the virialization proceeds mainly in the periphery. We discuss our results in the framework of the different physical mechanisms involved in the formation of the solar system. We conclude that the relative importance of the different physical mechanisms will depend on the initial conditions of the star formation process, which have not yet been determined with enough accuracy."}
{"text":"\nWe have developed a new technique for monitoring the performance of the Large Area Telescope (LAT) instrument on board the Gamma-Ray Large Area Space Telescope (GLAST) satellite. The technique utilizes a series of interleaved observations of the same target region with the LAT and the Tracking Image Sensors (TIS), which are two instruments on board GLAST with different imaging properties. We show that careful analysis of the data from such observations can provide a wealth of information on the performance of the LAT in the energy range above 1 keV, in particular on the stability of the energy response and on the absolute energy calibration. We find that the energy response of the LAT is very stable on timescales of a few days, provided that the total absorbed charge in the detector is kept within certain limits. We show that this can be achieved by observing a suitable target region with a sufficient duty cycle and with a sufficient overlap between the field of view of the LAT and the TIS. We have derived a method for correcting the energy response of the LAT on board the satellite, and we have shown that this method is accurate to within a few percent in the energy range above 1 keV. We have also derived a method for monitoring the absolute energy calibration of the LAT, and we find that the absolute energy scale is stable to within a few percent over the course of an observation and from one observation to the other."}
{"text":"\nWe study the structure of the effective field theory (EFT) of nuclear matter in a framework that avoids the conventional ` constrained EFT ' approach. The new EFT is based on a covariantlet field theory, which has the same dynamics as the standard EFT, but has a different gauge group. The advantage of this approach is that the EFT is built directly from the basic interactions, without the need to introduce additional constraints to reproduce the Standard Model (SM) dynamics. The new EFT has a pure gauge group, which in the limit of large number of fermionic generations is equivalent to the SM. We show that the new EFT has a universal structure, which in the pure gauge limit corresponds to the constrained EFT. However, this structure is less constrained than the usual constrained EFT and contains more degrees of freedom. We study the structure of the new EFT by looking at the two-loop contributions. We show that the new EFT has a better accuracy than the constrained EFT, and in particular, the new EFT has an accuracy that is better than the leading pion pion scattering theory, while the constrained EFT has the same accuracy as the leading pion pion scattering theory. We also show that the two-loop contributions in the new EFT can be calculated analytically, while in the constrained EFT they must be calculated numerically."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider the problem of retaining a particle within a black hole, for a range of black hole spin and momenta. We show that the largest orbit that can be retained is limited by the size of the event horizon, and that for this orbit the particle's velocity must be comparable to the speed of light. We consider a range of possible physical mechanisms that might be used to drive a particle into such a large orbit, and find that only mechanisms that extract energy from the black hole, by increasing its entropy, can accomplish this. We then consider the specific case of a particle with very large recoil velocity, and find that such a particle can be retained in a wide range of black holes if the particle is scattered by a photon with a large energy. We show that there is a simple relationship between the black hole spin, the photon energy, and the probability that the particle will be scattered by the photon, and we present a qualitative explanation for this relationship. We also show that this mechanism for retaining a particle can be made to work for a wide range of initial conditions, without requiring fine tuning. We also show that the same mechanism can be used to produce a range of interesting effects, such as super-fast orbits, and the ejection of matter from a black hole."}
{"text":"\n\nWe propose and analyze a chain-boson model for the dynamics of a few coupled superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) in a phonon bath. We find a good qualitative agreement between the model and recent experimental data on the dynamics of coupled SQUIDs, in particular in the relaxation of the mutual coupling and the effectiveness of a feedback scheme. In our model the dynamics of each SQUID is fully described by a set of master equations for the dynamics of the induced supercurrent, the superconducting order parameter, and the coupling coefficient. We solve the set of master equations analytically, and obtain a good agreement with the available data. The model allows to study the dependence of the dynamics on the temperature, the applied current, and the feedback strength. We discuss the influence of the non-Markovian dynamics of the superconducting order parameter on the relaxation of the mutual coupling, and on the efficiency of a feedback scheme for the dynamics of coupled SQUIDs."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a simple model based on the assumption that the Galactic disc is a rigid body and that the flow of matter between the disc and the intergalactic medium is driven by a pressure gradient. We show that this model can reproduce the observed properties of the Galactic disc warps, in particular their strength and their correlation with the position of the disc. We discuss the physical origin of the pressure gradient and the different physical processes that may have an impact on it. We show that a warped disc is in a stable configuration, provided that the pressure gradient is not too steep. This has important consequences for the study of the Galactic disc, in particular the problem of the transition between the stellar disc and the Galactic halo. The properties of the pressure gradient are such that the matter flows in the same direction as the disc's rotation. This could explain why the disc is warped in the same sense as the rotation. The model also predicts that the strength of the warps depends inversely on the total mass of the disc, which is consistent with observations. We discuss a possible physical origin of the pressure gradient and of the different physical processes that may affect it. In particular we show that the viscous evolution of the disc can naturally produce a pressure gradient. We also show that the disc can be in a stable configuration provided that the pressure gradient is not too steep. This has important consequences for the study of the Galactic disc, in particular the problem of the transition between the stellar disc and the Galactic halo."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present Fourier resolved spectroscopy of the low-mass X-ray binary 4U 1728-34. We observe the system in quiescence and measure spectral and temporal properties of the outbursts. We find that the accretion disc fluoresces brighter in the blue than in the red, in spite of the fact that the disc is seen nearly edge-on. This effect is explained by a strong temperature dependence of the emission measure. The measured width of the accretion disc is consistent with the disc being stable on the timescale of our observations, which covers several outbursts. We determine the accretion disc density from the measured accretion rate and find that it is a factor of  \u223c 2 lower than expected from assumptions of isothermal accretion and auniform density. The observed frequency-doubled burst modulation and the high-frequency noise in the outburst spectrum are explained by a model in which the inner accretion disc is geometrically stable and the outer accretion disc is stable on the timescale of an outburst but becomes instable on longer timescales. We discuss the origin of the low accretion disc density and the frequent eruptions from quiescence."}
{"text":"\nWe consider the possibilities of characterizing separability and entanglement in $(2\\times{D})$- and $(3\\times{D})$-dimensional systems by single-qubit and single-qutrit unitary transformations. We show that while such characterizations are in general not possible, there exist ways of achieving this for certain classes of entangled states in these systems. In particular, we show that if a state is entanglement- fractured in one qubit (or qutrit) then it can be converted into an equivalent state which is separable in the other qubit (or qutrit) using only single-qubit (or single-qutrit) unitary operations. We also show that if a state is separable in one qubit (or qutrit) and that qubit can be mapped onto the other qubit (or qutrit) by a single-qubit (or single-qutrit) unitary operation, then the state can be converted into an equivalent state which is entanglement- fractured in the other qubit (or qutrit) using only single-qubit (or single-qutrit) unitary operations. We also consider the possibility of using sets of single-qubit (or single-qutrit) unitary operations to characterize the possibility of converting any given state to an equivalent state in which entanglement is distributed over all qubits (or qutrits) and the individual qubits (or qutrits) are separable. We show that such a characterization is in general not possible, but that it is possible for a certain class of states.

{"text":"\nWe present the first survey of X-ray flares from gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) observed by the Swift satellite. The survey consists of 42 X-ray flares from 33 bursts, observed during the period August 2005 to February 2007. We find that the X-ray flux rises faster and is, on average, two times higher during the prompt emission than during the afterglow. The observed phenomenology is consistent with a radioactive decay model in which the parent radionuclide decays with a half-life of  \u223c 2 ms to a stable end-product. For most of the bursts with observed X-ray flares, the total radiated energy in X-rays is  \u223c 5 kJ, which is  \u223c 1% of the total burst energy. We show that the observed X-ray phenomenology can be explained by a simple model in which the X-ray emission arises from a single region, located at the boundary between the radiative and kinetic energy deposition regions. Our model predicts that the X-ray flare should rise with a given burst's total energy deposition and decay with the corresponding kinetic energy deposition. We discuss the implications of our results for the energy budget of GRBs and for the nature of the energy deposition and radiative processes in the bursts."}
{"text":"\n\nMultiscale agent-based models are a flexible tool for simulating complex biological processes such as cancer. We developed a multiscale agent-based model to simulate non-small cell lung cancer by integrating anatomic, cellular, and molecular dynamics.

The rules were based on our understanding of the biological processes that lead to the development and progression of non-small cell lung cancer.\n\nWe used the model to simulate the progression of non-small cell lung cancer from its earliest stages to its most advanced stages. The results of the simulation showed that the development and progression of non-small cell lung cancer was driven by the accumulation of genetic mutations in the cells and the competition between the cells for resources. The model also showed that the spatial structure of the tissue played a role in the development and progression of non-small cell lung cancer.\n\nThe results of our simulation were consistent with our understanding of the biological processes that lead to the development and progression of non-small cell lung cancer.

{"text":"\n\nWe present here the measurement of several composition-sensitive parameters of the surface detector of the Pierre Auger Observatory. The parameters are the mixing width (WM), the detector's resolution (\u0394R), and the charge collection efficiency (CC), defined as the probability that an incoming particle creates an electron-hole pair that is detected by the surface detector. The values of these parameters are important to understand the detector's response to hadronized particles of different charges and energies. We found that the values of WM, \u0394R, and CC are relatively insensitive to the hadronization process and show only small variations with the particle's energy. These results are in good agreement with the expectations from the detector's design and indicate that the surface detector provides a high level of uniformity in the longitudinal direction. The values of WM and \u0394R are found to be very small, in agreement with the prediction that the detector is able to resolve individual tracks. The value of CC is found to be slightly above the unity value expected for a detector with a bare minimum threshold for charge generation. We also found that the dependence of these parameters on the particle's charge is in accordance with the predictions from a simple theoretical model and is consistent with the idea that the charge generated by hadronization is distributed between several channels in a way that is only slightly dependent on the particle's initial charge."}
{"text":"\nWe motivate the paper by a brief review of the status of the search for new physics at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and by reviewing the status of the discussion on the connection between the LHC data and the String\/M theory. We then formulate the problem which this paper addresses, namely, to investigate the possibility that the LHC data may already contain some evidence of new physics which is related to the String\/M theory. More precisely, we investigate the possibility that the new physics which is related to the String\/M theory may already be contained in the Standard Model (SM) and thus may be already manifest in the LHC data. We then present the main idea of the paper. This main idea is to use the recently proposed Kologorov-Weinstein-Rennelli (KWR) inequality to search for new physics at the LHC. The KWR inequality gives a general and very precise statement of the conditions which a theory has to satisfy in order to be consistent with the data from a collider experiment. We then describe the method which we use to apply the KWR inequality to the LHC data. In particular we describe the way we calculate the KWR constant and the way we use the KWR constant to derive the lower bound on the cross section for a given signal. We then report the results of our analysis of the LHC data. These results are expressed in the form of the KWR constant and the lower bound on the cross section. The results are compared with the Standard Model prediction and with the prediction which is based on the assumption that the LHC data contains only the SM particles. We show that both the KWR constant and the lower bound on the cross section are in agreement with the Standard Model prediction and in disagreement with the prediction which is based on the assumption that the LHC data contains only the SM particles."}
{"text":"\n\nWe show that the thermal derivation of the Coleman-De Luccia tunneling prescription, as proposed in Ref., is incorrect. We analyze the relevant thermodynamics and derive the correct form of the Coleman-De Luccia tunneling prescription. The main ingredient is the relation between the thermal derivative and the ordinary derivative. We show that this relation is not valid in general. The correct tunneling prescription is more complicated than the one previously derived, but it has the same form as in the absence of thermal fluctuations. We analyze the conditions on the parameters of the system for which the tunneling prescription is exact. We also derive a simple approximation for the case in which the tunneling barrier is weakly disordered. The main conclusion of our work is that the validity of the tunneling approximation is more restricted than previously thought. However, the exact conditions for the validity of the approximation are rather technical and difficult to assess in practice. Hence, we also propose a simple practical approximation, which is more liberal than the exact conditions, but still captures the essential features of the tunneling behavior."}
{"text":"\n\nWavelet Transforms in a Critical Interface Model for Barkhausen Noise\n\nWe investigate the problem of statistical learning of a boundary between two different physical systems, where the observed data is generated by the critical coupling of the systems. Such problems arise, for example, in phase transitions between different statistical mechanics systems, in systems biology, or in the case of threshold-like phenomena in engineering. We consider a model problem in which the observations are samples from a random walk on a lattice, with a randomly chosen step size, and where the transition to a different random walk with a different step size occurs at a threshold value of the step size. The unknown threshold value is estimated from the data by using a wavelet transform. We show that both the empirical distribution of the wavelet coefficients and the minimum cross-validation error of the estimated threshold follow a heavy-tailed distribution, and we provide a rigorous theoretical explanation for this fact. We also show that the learned boundary can be used to generate new, synthetic data with a desired statistical properties."}
{"text":"\n\nWe study the statistical mechanics of cosmic string formation in a uniform and stationary flux of energy through space. We find that such a flux can create cosmic strings in a statistically steady state, provided that the energy flux has an asymmetric probability distribution, with a preference for large values. In this case, the number density of cosmic strings is found to be proportional to the root-mean-square (RMS) value of the flux. The possible mechanisms of cosmic string formation in this scenario are discussed. We also find that the break-up of existing cosmic strings is driven by the energy flux: in a uniform and stationary state, a cosmic string will break up when its tension becomes smaller than the RMS value of the energy flux. The newly created ends of the string will be attracted by the flux distribution, and will move towards the regions of large energy values, where they can form a new cosmic string by joining together. We show that this process can drive a slow evolution of the cosmic string network, and can even produce a explosive evolution, in the case when the flux distribution is very asymmetric. We discuss the possible physical mechanisms for the energy flux to create and evolve cosmic strings, and the problems this model can solve."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present observations of the magnetic field in a selection of HST grism images of the Magellanic Stream, a large-scale structure in the southern Galactic halo, in order to study the origin of the Stream and the role of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) in its formation. We find that the magnetic field in the Stream is directed westward, opposite to the direction of the Stream's motion, in agreement with earlier observations of the field in the LMC. We also find that the magnetic field in the Stream is ordered, in the sense that its direction is parallel to the Stream's velocity vector within the Stream's central region, in good agreement with theoretical models of magnetic field generation in galaxies. We discuss several possible mechanisms of magnetic field generation in the Stream and conclude that the simplest model, in which the Stream forms through the interaction of the LMC with a large-scale spiral feature in the Galactic disk, is the most likely one. In this model, the ordered magnetic field in the Stream is generated by the LMC's motion through the Galactic disk, in agreement with theoretical models of magnetic field generation. The good agreement between the observation and theory suggests that large-scale magnetic fields in galaxies are generated by the interaction of galactic scale structures with global features of the potential field, such as large-scale spiral or ring-like features."}
{"text":"\n\nWe study the relation between integrable systems and complex geometry. We show that an integrable system can be viewed as a special kind of complex geometry, namely a symmetric twist of a ruled surface in the complex plane. We show further that the integrable system \\Phi^3_c(x)=1-x^3+2x^2\\cos(2x)-x\\cos(4x)+2x^4\\cos(8x)-x^2\\cos(16x)+x^4\\cos(32x) has a moduli space of pseudoconvex curves of a special kind, that we call line bundles. We show that this integrable system is related to the geometry of line bundles in several ways, in particular that the associated line bundle is special, in the sense that it does not admit a non-trivial line bundle structure. We show further that this special line bundle has a parameter which is related to the parameter of the integrable system. We show that these parameters have a special form, which allows to describe the corresponding line bundle by a meromorphic function. We show further that this special line bundle admits a principal branch. We show that the symplectic group acts naturally on this special line bundle. We show that this special line bundle has a symmetric recession function, and that its Taylor expansion at the origin is related to the integrable system. We show that this integrable system can be viewed as a symmetric twist of a special line bundle, and that the symmetric part of this integrable system is related to the symmetric recession function of this special line bundle."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present an empirical method for determining the redshift of galaxies and clusters from their photometric redshifts in the SDSS. We determine the photo-redshift probability distribution function as a function of redshift, for galaxies in the SDSS whose redshift has already been determined spectroscopically. We show that the empirical distribution is consistent with the redshift being proportional to the observed shift in the color of the galaxies. We apply the method to a sample of luminous red galaxies (LRGs) and clusters in the SDSS, and determine the redshift of these galaxies and clusters. For the LRGs in our sample, we find that their redshifts are in the range 1.12 < z < 2.18, with a peak at 1.44. The average redshift of the clusters in our sample is 1.37, with a standard deviation of 0.07. We compare the distribution of the redshifts of our sample galaxies and clusters to the distribution expected from the photo-redshift probability distribution function, and find that they are consistent with each other. We conclude that the photo-redshift method is reliable for determining the redshift of galaxies and clusters in the SDSS."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a sensitive search for ultra-faint galaxies in the region of the Virgo Cluster core. We have observed with the 21-cm technique a total of 972 hours of data on 883 galaxies in this region with the Australia Telescope, as part of the VIRGOHI survey, in order to search for an excess of radio sources in the region of the Virgo Cluster core. We have found strong evidence for the presence of a large (M >> 1011 Msun), extended radio source at a distance of  \u223c 7.7 kMpc (H0 = 100 km\/s\/Mpc), which we provisionally call VIRGOHI 21. The projected spatial extent of this source is  \u223c 70 kpc. We have detected eight compact sources within this source which we provisionally classify as globular clusters. The radio source has a peak in the middle at a distance of  \u223c 3.8 kMpc. We discuss a number of possible identifications for this source. We conclude that the simplest explanation is that VIRGOHI 21 is a globular cluster system in the process of accretion of a large number of globular clusters from another galaxy, possibly a satellite. We have detected three sources which are spatially coincident with galaxies in the local volume, two of which have radio sources which appear to be globular clusters, and the third of which is the radio galaxy MRK 1236. We discuss a number of other possible identifications for these sources. We present a class diagram for the sources in the local volume, and use this to make a prediction for the distribution of globular cluster systems in the local volume. We have also detected a further four sources which appear to be globular clusters, and a further eight sources which require further analysis."}
{"text":"\n\nA novel method for the evaluation of uncertainty in dose volume histogram computation\n \nWe propose a new method for the evaluation of uncertainty in dose volume histogram (DVH) computation. The motivation for this work is to provide a simple and objective method to evaluate the impact of the different computation methods and their associated parameters on the statistics of the DVH. The proposed method is based on the use of two dose volume images, one representing the \"true\" dose distribution and the other representing the uncertainty associated with the measurement process. The uncertainty image can be obtained using several methods, such as the Monte Carlo method or the use of an algorithm which takes into account the statistical properties of the measurement process. We demonstrate that the use of our method allows a simple and objective evaluation of the impact of the computation method and its parameters on the statistics of the DVH. The method is validated using simulated data and its application to real patient data is illustrated."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present here a method for finding groups of galaxies in the SDSS DR5 photometric data. We define a group as a collection of galaxies connected by a network of bridges, where a bridge is defined as a pairwise similarity between galaxies which is stronger than what would be expected in a field of galaxies drawn from the same distribution with random pairwise distances. The method is entirely automatic and is based on the analysis of the pairwise distances between galaxies. We use a model of the pairwise distance distribution which allows to automatically determine the significant bridges. We find 3129 groups containing 108240 galaxies. We provide a list of the group members for each group, and we also produce a catalogue of all the galaxies in groups, together with the group membership probability for each galaxy. The catalogue also contains a measure of the overall group probability for each galaxy, allowing to select the galaxies which are most likely to be group members. We have tested the catalogue on a sample of galaxies with known group membership, and we find that the selection based on the group membership probability performs significantly better than a random selection."}
{"text":"\nWe have carried out a comparative timing and spectral study of Cyg X-2 in quiescence and in outburst, using data from the Rossi-ubble X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) and the European Space Agency's X-ray Multi-Mirror Array (XMM-Newton). In quiescence, Cyg X-2 shows three groups of X-ray flares, with an average repetition time of 3.5 ks. The X-ray light curve shows a high degree of correlation with the optical one, with both the rise and the decay being relatively fast. The observed phenomenology is consistent with a uniform spherical layer of hot gas, with a temperature of about 6 kK, surrounding the white dwarf. The model explains the main features of the quiescence light curve, including the time evolution of the oscillations and their correlation with the optical variations. In outburst, the accretion disk is responsible for the long-term correlation between the X-ray and optical light curves, while the power law component is explained by a point-source model. We found no evidence of a direct correlation between the accretion rate and the X-ray luminosity, nor between the accretion rate and the X-ray temperature, for the power law component. We have derived a correlation between the accretion rate and the observed Bremsstrahlung continuum, which may be used to infer the accretion rate when the accretion disk is the dominant source of X-rays, as is the case in outburst. Our data also show a correlation between the accretion rate and the X-ray count rate, in the low-energy part of the X-ray spectrum (below 2 keV), where the accretion disk is the dominant source. We have verified that these correlations hold for other low-mass X-ray binaries, provided that the accretion disk is the dominant source of X-rays. Our results suggest that the accretion disk is responsible for the correlation between the X-ray and optical light curves in outburst, while the hot corona is the dominant source in quiescence."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a large-scale, high-resolution catalog of 743 prominent galaxies in the Lyman\\alpha forest, selected from an optically-selected sample of 483 galaxies in a half square degree survey of the southern Great Barrier Reef region. These galaxies were chosen to have no known optical counterpart, to be free from the strong contaminating light of a nearby bright galaxy, and to have an optical continuum luminosity of $10^{36}$ erg s$^{-1}$. We have determined the redshift and radial velocity of these galaxies, and find that they fall into three distinct groups: (1) at large radius (and high redshift) there is a group of galaxies with large radial velocities (50-100 km s$^{-1}$), (2) at small radius (and intermediate redness) there is a group of galaxies with small radial velocities (10-30 km s$^{-1}$), and (3) in between these two groups there is a band of galaxies with intermediate radial velocities (30-50 km s$^{-1}$). This large-scale structure is consistent with a King- Improved Follow filtration model with four parameters: (1) the large-radius group, (2) the small-radius group, (3) the location of the band, and (4) the width of the band. Thus, structure on scales of $\\sim 1$ Mpc is well described by only four parameters. This picture is consistent with a statistical model in which galaxies are smoothly distributed in space, but are more concentrated in small volumes, and are less well concentrated in large volumes. We discuss this model, and its implications for the evolution of structure in the Universe."}
{"text":"\nWe present a new type of spin transistor based on graphene. The device is comprised of a heterostructure of a ferromagnetic (FM) layer and a graphene layer that are connected to the source and drain electrodes and a gate electrode is placed on top of the graphene layer. The operation of the device is based on the tunnel exchange interaction between the magnetic layer and the graphene layer. We show that the combination of an exceptional spin-orbit coupling in graphene and the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy in the magnetic layer results in a strong spin-transfer effect, which enables the device to work efficiently at room temperature. Our device realizes a new concept of spin transistor, in which the spin degree of freedom is used to control the charge degree of freedom, unlike the traditional scheme of using charge to control spin. Our simulation results show that the device has a large spin-to-charge conversion efficiency and can work at a low drain voltage, which makes it possible to cascade the devices to construct a spin logic circuit."}
{"text":"\n\nWe have measured the production of charged pions by protons on a tantalum target. Our aim was to investigate the longitudinal development of the scattered proton as a function of its energy. The longitudinal development was measured by detecting the scattered protons in the forward direction, in the plane of the target. We used a magnetic spectrometer to detect the charged pions; it was found that the detection efficiency as a function of the pion's momentum was well described by a curve which was obtained from a simulation of the longitudinal development of the scattered proton. The data were compared with the results of a theoretical model which includes the stopping power as a function of the proton's energy. A reasonable agreement was obtained, except that the theory predicts a larger contribution from higher energy protons than we observed. The model also predicts a correlation between the stopping power and the ionization density as a function of the proton's energy, and we observed such a correlation in our data."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present the discovery of 11 new T dwarfs in the Two Micron All-Sky Survey. These discoveries bring the number of T dwarfs detected in the survey to 27, of which 25 are late-type T dwarfs and two are L-T transition binaries. We have found a population of T dwarfs with a large number of low-mass objects (M-dwarfs), suggesting that the low-mass stars form in a different manner from their more massive counterparts. The low-mass T dwarfs have a lower luminosity, a larger number of spotted stars, and a wider range in temperatures than the massive T dwarfs. Our sample contains a large number of young objects, many of which are members of known associations. We present basic photometric and temperature properties of our new T dwarfs, and discuss their properties in the context of known T dwarfs. The T dwarfs in our sample are very diverse in temperature and most likely represent different evolutionary stages. The low-mass T dwarfs are likely to be young, whereas the massive T dwarfs are likely to be older. We have found a single T dwarf with a temperature intermediate between the low-mass and massive T dwarfs. This object, designated 2MASS J2126, may be a L\/T transition binary. The low-mass T dwarfs are the first stars to have formed in the Galaxy. Their large number indicates that the low-mass stars form through a completely different mechanism from massive stars."}
{"text":"\nWe study the effect of spatial anisotropy on the order parameter and the related critical behavior in a class of coupled two dimensional XY systems which includes the Ising model on the square lattice as a special case. We show that in a large class of such systems the order parameter has a phase transition to a state with different statistical properties. We derive a general criterion for the appearance of such a transition and study in detail the particular case of Ising model on the square lattice. We find a strong analogy with the one dimensional case, the only difference being that in the two dimensional case the transition is of first order, while in the one dimensional case it is of second order. We also show that in the two dimensional case the order parameter has another phase transition to a state with the same statistical properties as the initial one, but with different symmetry. We find that the conditions for the appearance of this transition are much more restrictive than for the transition to the fully disordered state."}
{"text":"\nWe found a correlation between the dynamics of synaptic plasticity and the patterns of neuronal activity that could give rise to cognitive functions. We discovered that a form of synaptic plasticity, which we called 'reverberatory synaptic plasticity', can lead to the generation of reverberatory activity in simulated neuronal networks. This activity is characterised by a repetitive activation of a subset of nodes, which then become silent, while the rest of the network is activated. The reverberatory activity is dependent on the relative timing of synaptic and neuronal activity. We also found that a combination of reverberatory synaptic plasticity and a dynamic threshold for synaptic plasticity can account for a variety of different patterns of activity that could underlie different cognitive functions. The finding that synaptic plasticity can lead to such different patterns of activity suggests that, contrary to the current belief, the direction of information flow in the brain need not always be unidirectional. In our model, the direction of the synaptic changes determines the flow of information, and hence the cognitive function that is learnt."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider the non-cooperative scheduling of multiple bag-of-task (BoT) applications, each of which consists of a set of tasks whose execution is invoked independently at random times. We assume that the execution of each task is associated with a certain cost and that the tasks of each application are independent of each other. We aim to minimize the total cost incurred by the execution of the tasks of all the applications by defining a suitable objective function and by scheduling the tasks according to this objective function. Since the applications do not cooperate with each other in the execution of their tasks, the resulting schedule may not be optimal from the point of view of any individual application. We consider two objective functions, namely, the total completion time and the total energy consumption, under the assumption that the energy consumption is a fixed cost for each task. We show that the resulting schedules are not necessarily optimal for any individual application, even if the total cost is minimized. We also investigate the case where the energy consumption depends on the actual execution time of the tasks. In this case, the resulting schedules may be optimal for some applications but not for others."}
{"text":"\n\nWe investigate the angular momentum (AM) conservation in the Sun and solar-like stars. We find that the AM per unit mass is proportional to the cube of the star radius, and inversely proportional to the cube of the star mass. This is consistent with the assumption that the AM is mainly due to the orbital motion of the mass around the galactic center. The AM per unit volume, on the other hand, is proportional to the mass. This is consistent with the assumption that the AM is due to the bulk motion of the fluid in the star. Therefore, we can conclude that the AM is mainly due to the orbital motion, except near the core where the mass is concentrated. In other words, the AM conservation in the Sun and solar-like stars is approximately valid only outside the convective zone.\n\nWe have developed a simple model to study the torsional oscillations in the Sun and solar-like stars. The model consists of a shell-like structure with the density distribution constant and the same temperature throughout the star. The radial and tangential displacement of the shell is assumed to be small compared to the radius and the thickness of the shell, respectively. Therefore, the shell can be treated as a rigid body, and the torsional deformation can be obtained from the relative twist of the two sides of the shell. We obtain the natural frequency of the torsional oscillation, and find that it is inversely proportional to the cube of the star mass. We also discuss the effects of the temperature, density distribution, rotation, and gravity on the torsional oscillation."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate the large attractive depletion interaction in a model system consisting of hard repulsive spheres embedded in a soft attractive matrix. We show that the strength of the depletion interaction is dependent on the diameter of the hard spheres, the volume fraction of the hard spheres, and the ratio of the hard and soft sphere radii, and we obtain a general formula for the interaction in terms of these parameters. Our analytical model is verified by comparison with numerical solutions for several realistic mixtures. Our results show that large attractive depletion interactions can be obtained in mixtures of hard and soft spheres, even in the absence of large inter-sphere distances, provided that the soft sphere radius is sufficiently large compared to the hard sphere radius. Our results have implications for the design of functional particle mixtures for applications in tissue engineering and drug delivery, and they suggest new ways to engineer the spatial organization of particles in mixtures."}
{"text":"\n\nCritical Delays and Polynomial Eigenvalue Problems\n\nWe consider a system of polynomial eigenvalue problems (PEP) which arises in the study of the delay of predator-prey systems. The polynomial eigenvalue problem is a standard problem in matrix analysis, and a great deal of theory has been developed to study the algebraic and geometric properties of such problems. In this paper, we present a motivation for the study of a particular class of PEP which is symmetric, and has eigenvalues which are repeated roots of unity. We show that these PEP share many properties with the critical delay problem. In particular, we show that the critical delay problem can be recast as a PEP with polynomial matrices which have the same set of eigenvalues. This PEP has an additional parameter, which can be used to tune the delay. We then consider the set of PEP with this parameter, and show that this set is equivalent to the set of PEP with polynomial matrices which have the same set of eigenvalues and are symmetric. We then consider the PEP with symmetric polynomial matrices, and show that this set is a subspace of the set of all PEP. We then consider the set of PEP with symmetric polynomial matrices and polynomial matrices which have the same set of eigenvalues, and show that this is a subspace of the set of all PEP.

{"text":"\nWe report the observation of Josephson current in a superconductor -- ferromagnet -- superconductor junction with in-plane ferromagnetic domains. The current is found to be proportional to the number of magnetic domains in the junction, and the magnitude of the current is found to depend on the relative orientation of the magnetic moment of the domains with respect to the current flow. These results are consistent with a picture in which the magnetic domains provide a finite barrier to the superconducting current, and the current is able to tunnel through these barriers, provided the number of domains is not too large. We also report the observation of a peak in the Josephson current as a function of the applied voltage, and show that this peak is related to the formation of a vortex state in the magnetic domains. These results are consistent with a picture in which the formation of a vortex state in the magnetic domains allows the superconducting current to tunnel through the barriers provided by the magnetic domains more easily. The results of this work may be useful in the development of new types of magnetic memory devices which rely on the manipulation of superconducting currents."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a study of the chemical composition of the circumstellar envelopes around yellow hypergiant stars. We aim to compare the chemical composition of these envelopes with those of red supergiants, and to investigate the effect of the initial chemical composition on the evolutionary tracks of both types of stars. We find that the envelopes around yellow hypergiants have a much lower molecular fraction than the envelopes around red supergiants. We also find that the relative abundance of the molecular species are consistent with the chemical composition of the gas at the initial condition for both types of stars, despite their different evolutionary tracks. This suggests that the chemical composition of the gas at the initial condition has a large impact on the chemical composition of the circumstellar envelope, regardless of the evolutionary path of the star. We also find that the molecular species with the largest abundance differences between the two types of envelopes are the species that are likely to form through a bottom-up process in the outer layers of the envelopes, where the temperature is relatively low. Our results suggest that the chemical composition of the circumstellar envelope is primarily determined by the chemical composition of the gas at the initial condition, and that the effect of the evolutionary track of the star is relatively small.\n\nWe thank T. christian knecht for kindly providing his chemodynamical model.

{"text":"\n\nWe investigate the dynamics of three-agent games, that is, games involving three participants, each controlling one agent. We consider games in which the agents are allowed to share common knowledge and we focus on the so-called symmetric games, that is, games in which the agents have identical strategies. We find that in symmetric three-agent games the existence of a Nash equilibria is guaranteed if and only if the number of strategies is equal to 3 or is a multiple of 3. We show that this is a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a Nash equilibria in symmetric three-agent games. In addition, we show that in symmetric three-agent games with odd number of strategies the game is guaranteed to have a pure strategy Nash equilibria if and only if the number of strategies is 3 or the number of strategies is a multiple of 2 and the payoff matrix has a particular form. We also show that in symmetric three-agent games with even number of strategies the game is guaranteed to have a pure strategy Nash equilibria if and only if the number of strategies is a multiple of 4.

{"text":"\n\nWe present a formal analysis of the effects of stellar surface structures on the precision of astronomical astrometry. We derive a general expression for the projected atmospheric structure in terms of the star's photometric, spectroscopic, and astrometric properties. We then evaluate the precision of astrometry that can be achieved with state-of-the-art telescopes and instruments, and find that despite substantial improvements in recent years, the limiting precision is still set by the presence of atmospheric structures, with a typical precision of a few nanometers. We show that the size of the structures can be reduced by using different observing strategies, and we discuss how to further optimize the observing strategy to achieve the best possible precision. We also derive a simple expression for the size of the structures as a function of the telescope's diameter, the star's luminosity, and the wavelength used for the observations. We find that this expression is in good agreement with the results of numerical simulations, and that it can be used to predict the effects of stellar surface structures on the precision of astrometry for a wide range of observing parameters."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present new observations of millisecond pulsars in globular clusters in search for radio emission from an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH). We have observed three clusters, M13, M31, and M34, with the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) and two clusters, M1 and M53, with the Very Large Array (VLA) at frequencies between 20 and 100 MHz. We find that the radio source in M13 is most likely a millisecond pulsar, the first to be discovered in a globular cluster. Based on a careful analysis of our observations and previously published data, we conclude that an IMBH is unlikely to exist in M13, M31, or M34 at the reported masses. We set an upper limit on the radio-transmitting fraction among millisecond pulsars in these clusters at 10^( \u2212 6). We also search for a signature of radio emission from an IMBH in M1 and M53, but find no evidence for such an object. We conclude that the upper limit on the number of millisecond pulsars in these clusters is such that the chance of finding a radio-transmitting IMBH in these clusters is small, and that no such object is present in M1 or M53."}
{"text":"\n\nBrane Tilings: We show a one-to-one correspondence between bilateral tilings of the plane and star maps of three-dimensional hyperbolic space. For a fixed genus, the total number of tiles in the plane is bounded from above by a constant, and the number of unique tiles is bounded from above by a linear function of the genus. We deduce from these bounds that any bilateral tiling can be realized by adding tiles to a tile set of a fixed size. We show further that for a fixed genus, there is a linear lower bound on the number of tiles in a bilateral tiling which can be obtained by adding tiles to a set of size two. We deduce from this lower bound that any linear lower bound on the number of tiles in a bilateral tiling can be achieved by adding tiles to a set of size two. As a consequence, we show that the class of bilateral tilings is closed under the operation of adding a single tile to a tile set. We show that the convex hull of a set of star maps of genus at most two is isometric to the boundary of the convex hull of a set of bilateral tilings of the plane of the same genus."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a deep imaging survey for the Hercules double star cluster (dSph) with the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT). We have obtained two sets of images with the LBT Multi-Object Spectrograph (LMOS), one with the near-infrared filter and one with the mid-infrared filter, both at an average depth of ~25 mag. We have combined the two sets of images to produce a single image in which the near-infrared stars are marked in blue and the mid-infrared stars are marked in red. We have analyzed the resulting image to obtain the structural parameters of the dSph. We find that the main body of the dSph has an elongated structure with a projected axis of 37.6 pc and a total extent of 71.8 pc. We also find a number of substructures in the dSph, including several chains of stars, a compact subcluster, and a number of single stars. The largest of the single stars is likely to be the escaped member of the dSph. The properties of the substructures are consistent with the effects of three-body interactions within the dSph. We discuss the properties of the Hercules dSph in the context of other elongated dSphs."}
{"text":"\nNonequilibrium steady states (NESS) of matrix product forms (MPF) are important in many areas of physics, but are hard to calculate. We present a systematic way of constructing NESSs for MPF. The method is based on the construction of the effective Hamiltonian matrix in the basis of the single-particle basis renormalized in the presence of the thermal bath. The method can be easily generalized to the NESSs with correlations, and also to the pure dephasing channel. We obtain the explicit expressions for the NESSs of the XX, XY, and FY models in the thermodynamic limit, and for the XY model in the finite size. The explicit expressions for the matrix elements of the NESSs enable one to use the iterative method to solve the NESSs with a large number of basis functions. As an example, we solve the NESSs of the XY model in a one-dimensional chain with the basis functions equal to the Goldstone bosons. The method can be easily modified to solve the NESSs with the basis functions equal to the collective excitations."}
{"text":"\n\nAsteroseismology of alpha Cen A. Evidence of rotational splitting.\nWe present photometric observations of the resolved rotational splitting in the Delta Scuti star alpha Cen A. We find that the star pulsates with a frequency of 8.99 Hz, which is 2.51 Hz lower than the previously reported frequency of 11.50 Hz. Our photometry also shows a second frequency of 12.15 Hz, which is 3.36 Hz higher than the previously reported frequency. We show that the previously reported frequency is a beat frequency between the two frequencies we observe, and we explain the reasons for the discrepancy. Our observations suggest that the rotational period of alpha Cen A is close to or equal to the pulsation period. The observed properties are consistent with a simple model in which the star's shape is distorted by an oblateness factor of 5.4, corresponding to a polar gravity of about 2.4 times the equatorial gravity. We estimate the ratio of the semimajor to semiminor axis of the star's oblateness to be 2.55 +0.52 \/-0.14, with an uncertainty of 7%. This is consistent with a prolate spheroid with a polar radius 1.28 +0.14 \/-0.10 times the equatorial radius. We discuss this model in the context of a possible relation between the shape of fast-rotating massive stars and their hydrostatic equilibrium ( Superstar), and find that it is consistent with a slight prolate distortion (or even a perfect spheroid) of the star if the minimum radius is achieved at the equator."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present an analysis of giant planets in debris disk systems with central clearings. We estimate the fraction of debris disk systems with giant planets that display a central clearing, and use this fraction to derive a frequency for giant planets in general. We show that the number of giant planets in the disks we observe is consistent with the giant planet frequency estimated in a previous study, but is not consistent with a lower frequency. This suggests that either the number of giant planets in our galaxy is higher than expected, or that the disks we observe are not representative of the general population of debris disk systems. We discuss this in the context of our current understanding of giant planet formation, and present a simple model in which the properties of giant planets and debris disk systems can be used to constrain the giant planet formation rate. This model indicates that the number of giant planets in debris disk systems is probably close to the number expected from giant planet formation, given the current estimates of the number of protoplanets.\n\nWe present estimates of the frequency of giant planets in debris disk systems, and use these estimates to constrain the giant planet formation rate.

{"text":"\nWe introduce a new higher order derivative, called the Schwarzian derivative, which is defined on a class of functions (called Schwarzian functions) that are twist-invariant, i.e. their behavior is the same under an orthogonal transformation of the underlying space. The Schwarzian derivative is shown to have properties that make it a good tool to study chaotic behavior. We give a condition for a function to be Schwarzian, and show that this condition is also sufficient for a function to generate a chaotic dynamics. As an application, we introduce a new concept, called an almost-free system, which is a generalization of the concept of a free system to the case of non-holonomic constraints. We show that this concept can be used to obtain a new necessary and sufficient condition for a system to be chaotic, and that this new condition has a simple geometric meaning. We also show that our new condition is equivalent to a well known condition for chaos in the case of holonomic constraints, and that the new condition is more general and can be applied to a wider class of systems."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a giant planet dynamical model that includes a gaseous proto-planetary disk with an initial architecture similar to that observed in young stellar systems. The planets are described by the Bernoulli family of potential energy functions with an added fifth order radial harmonic and coupling to the disk potential. We vary the orbital elements of the giant planets to obtain stable orbital configurations that are consistent with the observations of the solar system. We find that the most compact system has an orbital period ratio of the giant planets close to the golden ratio, which has been proposed to be a fundamental evolutionary step in the formation of planetary systems. We also find that the giant planets can form a stable orbital configuration around a wide variety of initial conditions in the disk, suggesting that giant planet formation is relatively robust to variations in the disk structure. The stable orbits are generally close to a 1:3:5 ratio for the orbital periods of the giant planets, which is very similar to the current orbital architecture of the solar system. We find that the giant planets can evolve by means of several different mechanisms, such as the harmonically driven oscillations of the semi-major axis and the ponderomotile forces of the giant planets on the disk. We present a detailed analysis of the giant planet dynamics and discuss the results in the context of giant planet formation and the evolution of the solar system."}

{"text":"\n\nWe present photometric detections of ten outflows in the Perseus molecular cloud, nine of which are new. These outflows are associated with six Class 0 protostars, one Class 1 protostar, and three evolved stars. We find that the outflows tend to beoriented in a direction between east-northeast and east-southeast, perpendicular to the star formation plane. The outflows have an average mass of 2 M\u2299, with a range of 0.5\u20134 M\u2299. They have an average velocity of 17 km s$^{-1}$, with a range of 4\u201338 km s$^{-1}$, and have an average lifetime of 1 kyr, with a range of 0.1\u201310 kyr. The outflows are not perfectly aligned with the hydrogen cyanide (HCN) line of sight, indicating that the outflows are not simply driven by the radiation pressure of the parent star. We discuss several possible mechanisms for driving the outflows. Our observations are consistent with a model in which the outflows are driven by a combination of the radio ionization wind from the parent star and the Poynting-vector-included fluid motion due to the turbulent density fluctuations in the star-forming cloud."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a study of the surface nitrogen abundances and effective temperature scales of massive stars in the solar neighbourhood, based on an analysis of their forbidden [OIII] 5007 luminosity in images obtained with the VLT-FLAMES spectrograph. We find that the distribution of massive stars with respect to their surface nitrogen abundances follows two distinct probability distributions, corresponding to two different groups of massive stars: (i) a group of very metal-poor stars, with [O\/Fe] > +1 and [N\/O] > +0.4, and (ii) a group of stars with intermediate metallicity, with [O\/Fe] < +1 and [N\/O] < +0.4. The temperature scale of the first group corresponds to an evolutionary phase in which N is still a major constituent of the stellar atmosphere, while the second group corresponds to an evolutionary phase in which N has been almost completely consumed by nuclear burning. The good agreement between these two groups, with respect to both their surface nitrogen abundances and their effective temperature scales, suggests that massive stars in our Galaxy follow a well-defined evolutionary path, from their initial formation until they end their lives as extremely hot and massive objects (type IIn supernovae). Our results also show that massive stars in the Magellanic Clouds are more metal-poor than those in the Galactic disk, but they are more evolved in terms of their surface nitrogen abundances and effective temperature scales. We discuss our results in the framework of different evolutionary scenarios for massive stars, taking into account the peculiar chemical properties of their initial stellar atmospheres, as well as different assumptions regarding the mixing and transport of chemical elements in their interiors."}

{"text":"\n\nBasis set convergence of post-CCSD contributions to molecular atomization energies\n\nWe present an investigation of the convergence properties of the basis set (BS) and post-CCSD (CCSD) contributions to the molecular atomization energies (AE) for a large set of molecules. The set of molecules consists of the Workshop on Basis Sets and their Applications (WOBSA) benchmark set of non-periodic systems, the aristolene benchmark set, and several systems with large basis sets. We find that the BS contributions to the AE are relatively insensitive to the basis set size for all the sets of molecules. On the other hand, the post-CCSD contributions to the AE exhibit a strong basis set size dependence, with the qualitative behavior depending on the system. For example, for the non-periodic systems, we observe a slow-down of the convergence as the basis set size is increased, while for the aristolene set, the post-CCSD contributions to the AE converge rapidly as the basis set size is increased. We discuss our results in the framework of theEmpirical Formula (EF) approach, and show that a modified EF (MEF) which includes the BS and the post-CCSD contributions to the AE can be used to evaluate the performance of basis sets for all the sets of molecules in a simple and straightforward way."}
{"text":"\nWe consider the problem of determining the effective potential V(q) for a many-body system described by a second-order phase transition. We show that the renormalization group functions, constructed from the dynamics of the system, contain all the information needed to determine V(q) uniquely. This is in contrast to the usual procedure of expanding the effective two-body operator in a series ofERAL Charlie Johnson operators. The renormalization group approach has the advantage that it is exact, while the expansion in Charlie Johnson operators is an approximate procedure. The renormalization group functions can be computed exactly from the knowledge of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian, without any parameter fitting. As an application, we consider the recent proposal of Donath and engrailed to modify the standard method of constructing the effective potential in terms of Charlie Johnson operators. We show that their procedure is equivalent to a simple change of basis in the space of renormalization group functions."}

{"text":"\nWe propose and study a generalization of the orbital Hubbard model to describe the liquid-like behavior in manganites. The model includes the contributions of both the spin and orbital degrees of freedom and is based on the assumption that the single-particle basis renormalization is entirely due to an effective orbital field. We show that such a model can describe a wide range of experimental data on orbital excitations in various manganites, including the non- Fermi liquid behavior. The main ingredients of our model are the orbital Coulomb interaction and a potential that describes the single-particle basis renormalization. We find that a competition between an orbital liquid and a spin liquid is responsible for a wide range of non-Fermi liquid behavior, such as the appearance of a Hall effect and a non-zero resistivity at zero temperature. Our model allows us to understand the role of the Coulomb interaction in the formation of an orbital liquid and to quantify the importance of the various mechanisms that contribute to the orbital excitation spectrum."}

{"text":"\n\nWe extend the concept of coherence to pairs of multivariate time series. We show that a simple extension of the conventional definition of coherence allows one to characterize the dynamics of phase synchronization in such pairs. In particular, we find that a large number of common features previously identified on the basis of coherence can be understood in terms of the properties of this generalized measure. At the same time, our results reveal a number of new features that have not been identified before. As an application, we show that this generalized coherence can be used to remove the zero-lag contribution to synchronization, thereby revealing the underlying dynamical structure in a more direct way. In particular, we show that this procedure can be used to extract additive noise components from the original time series, provided that they are uncorrelated with the rest of the dynamics. This has important implications for the study of complex systems, since it provides a way to remove synchronization due to external driving and to focus on the internally generated dynamics."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present the discovery of 52 galaxies with hidden Seyfert 2 nuclei in the Chandra Deep Field North. These galaxies were selected from a list of 250 galaxies with low X-ray surface brightness and relatively high ultraviolet and optical surface brightness selected from a catalog of galaxies with known X-ray emissions. We present a list of the hidden Seyfert galaxies, together with their X-ray and optical properties, and discuss their implications for the obscured Seyfert population as a whole. We show that a significant fraction (52%) of the obscured Seyfert 2 population consists of galaxies with optical\/NIR surface brightnesses in the range 12-36 mag arcsec-2, a factor of ~2 brighter than the obscured Seyfert 1 galaxies. The hidden Seyfert 2 galaxies include a number of galaxies that are bright in the ultraviolet but have low optical surface brightness, consistent with a large unobscured nucleus in an optically thick dust shell. We also find that a number of galaxies in the hidden Seyfert 2 sample are likely to be unobscured Quasars, and are included in the sample due to their high ultraviolet surface brightness. The properties of the hidden Seyfert 2 galaxies are consistent with the idea that the UV-optical-NIR surface brightness is a useful tracer of the distribution of dust in the galaxies. We discuss the implications of our results for the unobscured and obscured Seyfert galaxies, and for the theory of galaxy formation."}
{"text":"\nWe present a study of the time-domain variations in the spectral index of Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), the massive black hole at the center of the Milky Way. We find that the spectral index displays strong circadian and suborbital modulations, with a peak-to-trough amplitude of  \u223c1.5. The suborbital variations are approximately in anti-phase with the photospheric radial velocity variations, with the maximum\/minimum occurring roughly at the radial velocity min\/max. We find that the high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs) in the globular clusters in the Sagittarius-Carina superbubble contribute to the variability of the spectral index. In particular, we show that the sum of the HMXB light contributes to the suborbital modulation with a period of a few days, in anti-phase with the radial velocity. Our analysis also suggests that the infalling gas is likely to be the source of the circadian modulation. We estimate the accretion rate of Sgr A* to be  \u223c1.4 10^-14 M\u22c5s-1. The relatively long period of the circadian modulation ( \u223c70 days) may be related to the period of the convection inside the accretion disc.

{"text":"\n\nWe present here results of a search for baryonic emission in the form of radio galaxies and clusters in a half square degree survey using the Australia Telescope at low redshift (z < 1). A total of 992 galaxies are detected in a half square degree survey with a mean redshift of 0.9. The distribution of these galaxies is very uniform, with no large scale structure visible. A statistical analysis of the redshifts of the galaxies shows that there is no significant peak in the distribution, suggesting that the local volume is representative of the Universe as a whole. A cluster search is also performed, and a total of 65 clusters are found with a mean redshift of 0.8. The clusters show a large range in radio power, and a number of the clusters show unusual morphology, including a number of mini-clusters. We discuss the nature of the clusters and the possible causes of the large range in radio power.

We find that the XLFs are well described by a broken power law, with the break at log(LMX\/L solar) \u223c -1.6. We split the XLFs into two parts: the faint end, with log(LMX\/L solar) < -0.6, and the bright end, with log(LMX\/L solar) > -0.6. We find that the bright end of the XLF is well described by a power law with a positive index, while the faint end is well described by a power law with a negative index. We also present the X-ray colors and the masses of the galaxies in the GOODS survey. The X-ray colors show significant correlation with the optical colors, but no significant correlation with the masses of the galaxies.

{"text":"\n\nWe consider the beta function of gauge theories at two loops in differential renormalization. The motivation for this work is to better understand the structure of the beta function as well as the relation between the different loop orders. We show that the beta function is related to the structure of the adjoint representation and that it can be obtained from the inner structure of the underlying gauge theory. The methodology is based on the use of the relationship between the differential and integral forms of renormalization, which allows us to systematically evaluate the beta function in this context. The main results are that the beta function is related to the duality between the adjoint representation and the fundamental representation, and that it is an element of the representation theory of the underlying gauge theory. We also show that the beta function is related to the structure of the coefficients of the theory, and that it can be evaluated in terms of the matrix elements of the operators involved. The problem this work attempts to solve is to better understand the structure of the beta function, and the theoretical implications of this structure.

{"text":"\n\nWe present mass-to-light ratios (MLRs) for a sample of 581 Ly-alpha emitting galaxies at redshifts z=5.7, 6.5, 7, and 8.8, selected from the two-dimensional Ly-alpha surveys done with the Hubble Space Telescope. We have derived the MLRs from the absolute photometric magnitudes and the radial velocity measurements from the GLASS survey. We find that the MLRs are well described by a power law with a index of 1.94 plus a constant of 2.45 kpc-1 Mpc-1. This is in reasonable agreement with the correlation between MLR and redshift found for galaxies in the local universe, but differs significantly from the relation found by 1996ApJS..108..713Grafton et al. for a sample of Ly-alpha emitting galaxies at high redshift (z<1). The MLRs of our sample at high redshift (z>>1) are also in good agreement with the local relation, but the sample is small and the scatter is relatively large. If the relation found by Grafton et al. is correct, the scatter in the MLRs of our sample at high redshift could be explained by a simple power law with an index of 1.8. The MLRs of our sample at intermediate redshift (z<<1) are well described by a single power law with an index of 1.94, in disagreement with the local relation. We discuss several possible explanations for this discrepancy, including the effects of interlopers, dust, and an evolving MLR correlation."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present here the fourth of several papers based on our ongoing Spitzer c2d Survey of large, nearby, interstellar clouds. Our primary goal has been to obtain high-resolution spectra of stars toward the north side of Lupus, a nearby stellar association that contains many young stars and their associated clouds. We have used these data to measure the temperatures, masses, and radii of these clouds, and to derive the kinematic and chemical properties of the gas in the clouds. We present here the analysis of our observations of clouds in Lupus that were observed with the Multiband Imaging Photometer for Spitzer (MIPS). We find that the clouds in Lupus are significantly cooler, on average, than those in the Rosette and Monoceros associations, but are more closely linked to their associated stars. The mass-radius relation for Lupus is consistent with an isothermal gas distribution, and is well described by a power law with a slope of 1.3. We also present chemical data for a subset of clouds in Lupus. The gas in these clouds is close to chemical equilibrium, but there are systematic differences between clouds, with some clouds being slightly metal-poor and some slightly metal-rich. The gas kinematics in the clouds are complex, with many clouds showing several kinematic components.

{"text":"\nWe present herein a new determination of the epicycle frequency in the galactic disk, and the derived rotation velocity V0. We use high-resolution Isaac Newton Group (ING) radio images obtained with the 5-element MeerKAT array, with 50 MHz of bandwidth, to measure the disk's rotational velocity with an accuracy of a few percent. This is an improvement on the previous such measurement by a factor of almost two, and it has significantly better precision than other recent measurements. We find that the radio galaxies in the disk have a mean radial velocity of 39.48 \u00b1 0.07 km s\u22121. We combine this with previous optical measurements of the galactic disk to derive the epicycle frequency, f, and the corresponding V0. The measured f is 72.75 \u00b1 0.19 Hz, and the best-fit model gives V0 = 1670 \u00b1 6 km s\u22121. We find that the scatter in the data is largely due to non-disk radio galaxies, and that a cleaned set of data gives f = 72.71 \u00b1 0.05 Hz and V0 = 1672 \u00b1 4 km s\u22121. This is consistent with the assumption that the epicycle frequency is the same as the rotation frequency of the disk. This determines the mass of the galactic disk to be  \u223c 4.1 kpc \u00d7 1.4 kpc \u2212 1 \u00d7 5.9 kpc \u2212 2 Mpc3, where the error is 1\u03c3, and the confidence level is 95%. This is equivalent to a mass of  \u223c 1.8 \u00d7 1012 M\u2299,  \u223c 0.9% of the total mass of the Milky Way. The lowest mass estimate for the disk is \u223c 1.4 kpc \u00d7 1.3 kpc \u2212 1 \u00d7 5.9 kpc \u2212 2 Mpc3 (1\u03c3 confidence), or  \u223c 0.6% of the total mass of the Milky Way. We discuss various ways in which this mass estimate can be improved, but even with these low-mass estimates, we can conclude that the disk has a very low mass compared to the mass of the bulge and the halo. This has implications for galactic structure, and for the relative importance of the disk in the formation and evolution of our galaxy."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present here a shell model study of the structure and properties of neutron rich oxygen isotones. The motivation for this work is to provide a better understanding of the structure and properties of these nuclei, which are relevant to the debate on the r-process mechanism and the observation of nuclear clustering in heavy nuclei. We use the standard quasiparticle random phase approximation (QRPA) and the random phase approximation (RPA) with the Jade sympathy potential. We study the effect of theQRPA and the RPA on the properties of these nuclei, and find that these approaches can give different results for the same nucleus, which has important implications for the study of these nuclei. The QRPA approach gives better agreement with the experimental data for the mass, the second moment of the charge distribution, and the quadrupole moment, while the RPA approach gives better agreement with the experimental data for the neutron number and the average distance between the protons and neutrons. The results obtained with the RPA approach are consistent with the expectation that the addition of a neutron to an oxygen isotone leads to a reduction of the average distance between the protons and neutrons, and a narrowing of the charge distribution. The results obtained with the QRPA approach are consistent with the expectation that the addition of a neutron to an oxygen isotone leads to a decrease of the mass, a decrease of the second moment of the charge distribution, and an increase of the quadrupole moment. The problem of the r-process mechanism is discussed in the framework of these two approaches."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present theoretical results for the excitation energies, polarizabilities, multipole transition rates, and lifetimes of ions along the francium isoelectronic sequence. The motivation for this work is to provide accurate theoretical results for highly charged ions which are needed to compute the various photonic processes which occur in a multipole ionizer. The key ideas and methodology are to use the random phase approximation to obtain the excitation energies and polarizabilities of a particular ion and to use the025 basis set to compute the transition rates and lifetimes. The results obtained are in good agreement with available experimental data. The only practical application for this work is for the computation of multipole ionization and excitation yields in a discharge lamp. The theoretical results can be used to optimize the discharge lamp and to provide a better understanding of the various photonic processes which occur in such a lamp. The theoretical results also have implications for future research. In particular, we have compared the results for the random phase approximation with those obtained for the random-phase-approximation-plus-relativistic-effects approximation. We have found that the latter approximation provides excellent agreement with experiment, whereas the former does not. Thus, it appears that the random-phase-approximation-plus-relativistic-effects approximation is the one which should be used in the future."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate the dynamics of a geometrically shocked relativistic fluid with vorticity, in the limit of strong vorticity and large shock strength, inspired by recent observations of geometrically shocked high-energy-density plasmas in magnetospheric multiscale (MMS) tornadoes. In our model the fluid is subject to a sudden acceleration, which results in the development of a shocked region with vorticity. We find that the velocity distribution function is well described by a WKB-type solution in the limit of a large and fast-growing shocked region, which shows the development of a vortex sheet and helical vorticity patterns. The slowly decaying core region is characterized by strong vorticity and is crowned by a vortex filament. We also discuss the limit of a large and slowly decaying shocked region, which is well described by a Buongiorno-Soul\u00e9-type solution with a slowly rotating core. Our findings suggest that geometrically shocked MMS plasmas with strong vorticity can be well described by a simple fluid model with a WKB-type solution, provided that the shocked region is large and fast-growing, while a more complex model is needed for slowly decaying shocked regions."}
{"text":"\nWe have developed a theory of energy generation by macroscopic turbulence in GRB afterglows, based on the idea that the energy is extracted from the afterglow turbulence by a violently rotating magnetic field. We consider a homogeneous isotropic afterglow with uniform density and temperature, and a turbulence velocity distribution described by the Kolmogorov model. We find that the energy extraction by the magnetic field is highly efficient, with an efficiency of about 60-70%. We also find that the energy in the magnetic field increases approximately linearly with the Kolmogorov scale and the square of the magnetic field rotation velocity, and decreases with the inverse of the magnetic field radius. These results agree with our previous estimates based on a numerical simulation. We also analyze the energy spectrum of the magnetic field, and find that it is consistent with a Maxwell distribution with a variance proportional to the inverse of the Kolmogorov scale. We discuss the physical mechanisms that may be responsible for the energy generation in the magnetic field, and explain why the energy generation is more efficient in the afterglow than in the inflowing gas. We also suggest a method for measuring the energy density in the magnetic field in a galaxy-sized magnetic field generator."}
{"text":"\n\nForbidden territories in the string landscape\n\nWe consider a family of inhomogeneous neurons coupled by a set of synaptic connections which can be randomly reconfigured. The possible topologies of the synaptic connectivity are restricted to a finite set of structures which we call the string topologies. The activity of the neurons is subject to a homeostasis process which acts to prevent the activity from wandering into a subset of the possible string topologies, the so-called forbidden territories. We show that, in spite of this regulation, the dynamics can visit a finite set of special topologies from which it can subsequently escape, and that the set of visited topologies is strictly contained in the set of string topologies. We consider the particular case of scale-free topologies and show that the dynamics can visit a set of scale-free topologies which is a proper subset of the set of all scale-free topologies. Furthermore, we show that the possible number of visited scale-free topologies is strictly smaller than the total number of scale-free topologies, thus providing a possible explanation for the so-called scale-free paradox. We also show that the set of visited topologies is necessarily a discrete set."}

We find that the X-ray luminosity of SN 2004et is dominated by the outward-propagating shock wave rather than by the radioactive decay of the iron core. We estimate the shock-wave luminosity to be L_{\\rm shock} \\sim 2.3 kcal { }  s^{-1} and the radiative-ogle luminosity to be L_{\\rm rad} \\sim 1.4 kcal { }  s^{-1}. The rest of the properties of SN 2004et, such as the mass of the progenitor star and the explosion energy, are consistent with a low-mass-core supernova. We discuss the physical mechanism of the X-ray emission in terms of the interactions between the shock wave and the expanding bubble of the radiative envelope. Our results suggest that Type IIp supernovae with a low-mass iron core can produce an X-ray emission feature that is similar to the so-called X-ray echo, which is thought to be due to the interaction between the shock wave and the boundary layer in a Type II supernova."}

In this paper, we mainly focus on the hyperblack hole solutions, which include the five dimensional black holes, wormholes and spacetime horns. We show that these solutions satisfy the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet equations, and we give a general method to construct the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet black holes in any number of dimensions. The main difficulty in the theory is that the bridge conditions become nonlinear when the number of dimensions is greater than two. Therefore the exact solutions of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory have been obtained in dimensions equal to or greater than seven. Our method provides a way to construct the exact solutions of the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory in any dimension, and in particular in five dimensions."}

This power-law singularity can be understood by considering a simple model in which the spins are localized over a finite region and interact with their neighbors according to a nearest-neighbor rule. We find that the power law exponent in this simple model is equal to the spectral dimension of the underlying lattice.\n\nOur results suggest a new way of understanding the critical dynamics of Ising chains, and have important implications for the study of criticality in lattice models.

{"text":"\n\nThe Carina Nebula is a vast stellar nursery located in the southern constellation of Carina. This extremely active star forming region is home to young, extremely hot stars, some of which are 50 times the mass of our Sun. These stars are shaping the nebula and causing the formation of gas clouds and dust clouds. The star formation and interactions of the young stars with the clouds are very dynamic and change rapidly. Our knowledge of the properties of these young stars and clouds has been derived from a variety of observations in different wavebands from radio to ultraviolet. We have combined new data from the Very Large Array (VLA) with data from the 2 Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) and the Ultra Violet EXOSAT Observatory (UVEO) to produce a comprehensive study of the stars and clouds in the Carina Nebula. We find that the VLA data are particularly sensitive to embedded radio sources and reveal many more sources than previous observations. We have also combined the VLA data with data from previous Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations of the Carina Nebula. We find that the VLBI data are sensitive to the coldest regions in the clouds and the VLA data are sensitive to the hottest regions. By combining these data we are able to study the full range of physical conditions in the clouds. We find that many of the regions in the clouds are much more turbulent than previously thought. In some regions the gas is moving with speeds as high as 30 km\/s. In other regions the gas is stationary. We find that these turbulent regions are associated with regions of high mass density and that they are relatively small on the scale of the cloud. We present models of the clouds which allow us to study the large scale structure as well as the small scale turbulence. We find that the large scale structure is relatively simple and that the turbulence has little effect on the overall structure."}

{"text":"\nWe study the nonlinear turbulent magnetic diffusion and effective drift velocity of large-scale magnetic field in a two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. The motivation for the research is to understand the basic mechanism of the energy transfer from the large-scale magnetic field to the small-scale magnetic field in MHD turbulence. The key ideas and methodology are to employ the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations with the large-scale magnetic field diffusion and the small-scale magnetic field generation by the small-scale turbulence. The effective drift velocity of the large-scale magnetic field is obtained by the Tomatoes techniques, which can be viewed as the local drift velocity of the large-scale magnetic field with respect to the small-scale turbulence. The obtained results show that the energy transfer from the large-scale magnetic field to the small-scale magnetic field is mainly due to the nonlinear turbulent magnetic diffusion. The effective drift velocity of the large-scale magnetic field increases with the increase of the large-scale magnetic field strength and the small-scale turbulence intensity, and it increases with the decrease of the Reynolds number. Our findings can be implications for future research in the large-scale magnetic field transport and the small-scale magnetic field generation in MHD turbulence."}

{"text":"\nCooperative action in eukaryotic gene regulation: physical properties of a viral example\n\nWe have recently proposed a simple model of cooperative gene regulation in which gene expression is governed by the binding of transcription factors to their cognate DNA-binding sites. In this model, the DNA-binding sites are assumed to be separated by a small distance, and the binding of a single transcription factor is insufficient to bridge the gap between the binding sites, resulting in cooperative binding of multiple transcription factors. We proposed that such cooperative binding could explain the rapid and efficient gene activation seen in many gene regulatory systems.\n\nIn this paper, we investigate the physical properties of cooperative gene regulation by analyzing a viral example. We consider the herpes simplex virus (HSV) gene regulatory system which is responsible for the switch from latency to lytic growth. This system is controlled by the binding of transcription factors to a set of DNA-binding sites located in the viral genome. We analyze the binding of these transcription factors to their cognate DNA-binding sites, and we show that this binding is cooperative, resulting in the rapid and efficient gene activation observed in the viral gene regulatory system.\n\nWe also investigate the physical properties of the viral genome, and we show that the cooperative binding of the transcription factors is a consequence of the physical properties of the viral genome. In particular, we show that the cooperative binding is a result of the long-range electrostatic interactions between the transcription factors and their cognate DNA-binding sites. We propose that cooperative gene regulation is a general feature of gene regulatory systems, and that it is a consequence of the physical properties of the genome."}
{"text":"\n\nThe solar transition region is a crucial but relatively poorly understood region of the solar atmosphere, where the temperature increases rapidly from approximately 6000 K to 1 MK. The dynamics in this region is complex, due in part to the competing gravitational and magnetic forces. The large-scale magnetic field is generally frozen into the convection, but on a local scale the field can be highly dynamic, with regions of enhanced, decreasing, or even vanishing magnetic field strength. The region is also the site of many interesting small-scale phenomena, such as solar flares and nanoflares. The behavior of the transition region is key to understanding solar wind acceleration, as well as the formation of solar active regions.\nIn order to better understand the solar transition region, we have used data from the Hinode spacecraft's EIS (EUV Imaging Spectrometer) instrument. We have analyzed the visible and ultraviolet data in combination with magnetic field data from the H\u03b1 telescope, in order to study the dynamic features in the transition region. In particular, we have looked at how the magnetic field is structured in this region, and how this field structure relates to the observed dynamic features.\nWe have found a strong correlation between the dynamic features and the magnetic field strength. In particular, we find that the appearance of small-scale dynamic features is highly dependent on the local magnetic field strength. These results suggest that the magnetic field plays a key role in the dynamics of the transition region, and point to the importance of considering the small-scale features in future transition region studies."}

We determine the cluster parameters (the number of massive stars, their mass, and the cluster's total mass) for the member stars in the 13 candidate clusters found. Four of the clusters (including the closest one, at 2.6 pc) are newly discovered. The number of massive stars in these clusters ranges between 2 and 99, with a total cluster mass of $1-3 \\times 10^{4} M_{\\odot}$. The highest mass cluster, Mensa, contains the largest number of massive stars.

{"text":"\n\nWe study the two-dimensional Burridge-Knopoff model of earthquakes by numerical simulation. The model consists of a background medium in which quakes nucleate and grow in an arcade-like pattern. We find that the dynamic structure of the system is characterized by a large number of branches of different length, which are all connected at their tips. These branches are capable of initiating quakes of various sizes, and the probability distribution of the sizes is given by the Gumbel distribution. In this way, the model is able to generate quakes of all sizes in a manner that is consistent with the observed size distribution of earthquakes. We also find that the dynamic behavior of the system is characterized by an exponential increase in the number of branches as the system evolves, and that the distribution of the number of branches at any time is given by a power law. The finding that the number of branches grows exponentially is consistent with the observation that the number of earthquakes does not change monotonically but rather shows sharp increases and decreases. We also discuss the effect of various model parameters on the dynamic behavior of the system."}
{"text":"\nWe present COSMOSOMAS observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and galactic foregrounds at 11 GHz, in the range 8 - 12 GHz. We report the detection of a large-scale foreground structure in the galactic plane, which we show to be associated with the distribution of cold hydrogen gas in the Milky Way. The intensity of this emission is much stronger than expected on the basis of simple models of the interstellar medium, and it is inconsistent with a uniform distribution of gas in the galactic plane. In addition, we report the detection of a significant background level of microwave emission at high Galactic latitudes, above the background level expected from the CMB, with a distribution that is consistent with a spherical shell centered on the North Galactic pole. We discuss a possible physical origin for these observations, involving a large-scale structure in the distribution of relativistic electrons in the Galactic halo. We show that a model involving a single, large diameter, torroidal orbit for the distribution of relativistic electrons can account for both the observed foreground and background structure in a self-consistent manner."}

{"text":"\n\nWe construct a slave boson theory of the extended Falicov-Kimball model. The extended Falicov-Kimball model is a recently proposed theory which combines the features of the standard Falicov-Kimball model and the gravity-mediating model.

The extended Falicov-Kimball model combines these two models by introducing a parameter a so that C \u2248 aC and C \u2248 aC. Therefore, in the extended Falicov-Kimball model, the mesons and baryons are treated in a unified way by means of the meson-baryon coupling constant aC, while in the gravity-mediating model, the mesons and baryons are treated separately by means of the meson-baryon coupling constants aC and aC, respectively.

{"text":"\nWe present a detailed analysis of the impact of accretion disk winds on the X-ray spectrum of AGN. We find that the most important effects are a reduction of the ionized column density and a removal of the gas pressure in the accretion funnel. This causes the X-ray lines to be broadened and a reduction of the number of ionized atoms along the line-of-sight. We evaluate these effects by comparing our models with observations of the accreting supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei (AGN), in particular with observations of the X-ray spectra of low-power AGN (LMXBs and DMXBs) and with observations of the wind-influenced X-ray emission from the microquasars. \n\nWe find that the impact of accretion disk winds on the X-ray spectrum of a distant observer depends in a non-monotonic way on the ratio of the wind's velocity to the escape velocity of the accretion disk. For the lowest power AGN (LMXBs) the wind has only a small effect on the X-ray lines, while for the highest power AGN (DMXBs) the wind can almost completely remove the X-ray lines. We also find that in the case of the microquasars the observed X-ray line width is in good agreement with the predictions of our model, while the observed X-ray luminosity is somewhat higher than what our model predicts. This can be explained by the fact that in our model the accretion disk is optically thick, while in the microquasars the accretion disk is optically thin. We discuss the observational consequences of our findings."}
{"text":"\n\nWe propose and analyze a general formalism of configuration space methods for scalar propagators in (anti and) de Sitter spacetimes. Our approach is based on the use of the so-called Twistor formalism, which allows us to associate to each geometric structure in (anti and) de Sitter spacetimes a unique twistor structure. This association enables us to give a unified treatment to both anti de Sitter and de Sitter spacetimes in the framework of configuration space methods. As an application, we analyze the structure of the annihilation and creation operators in the framework of the twistor formalism. We also study the relationship between our formalism and the well-known geometrical approach of John Wheeler. The main difference between our approach and the Wheeler's approach is that ours is more general, in the sense that it can be applied to both anti de Sitter and de Sitter spacetimes, while Wheeler's approach is restricted to de Sitter spacetime. We also study the problem of time ordering in the framework of our configuration space methods.

{"text":"\n\nWe consider the problem of describing the dynamical evolution of stellar clusters in galaxies.

We find that the relaxation time of the cluster is inversely proportional to the square of the ratio of the kinetic energy to the potential energy. We discuss the physical meaning of the solution, and show that the relaxation time is inversely proportional to the square of the cluster mass. We compare the result with the case of an N-body cluster, and discuss the differences.

Finally, we discuss some applications of our results."}
{"text":"\n\nUnambiguous coherent state identification: Searching a quantum database\nWe propose and analyze a quantum algorithm for unambiguous identification of coherent states of a qubit from a quantum database. The algorithm makes use of the quantum superposition principle and can be realized with elementary quantum gates. We show that if the states to be distinguished are not close in the quantum state space, then the algorithm has a high probability of success. In particular, if one wants to distinguish between two different coherent states which are not close in the Hilbert space, then success can be guaranteed by using only a constant number of quantum gates and resources. We analyze the algorithm efficiency as a function of the distance in the quantum state space between the states to be distinguished and show that it is a continuous function with a sharp threshold. The practical consequence is that one can implement the algorithm in practice with a given number of quantum gates and resources, and if it does not work, then it is guaranteed that it will not work, no matter how long one waits.\n\nWe also propose a quantum algorithm for searching a quantum database for a given state \u03c8. The algorithm is based on the quantum operation of shallow discrimination and uses a series of discrimination operations, each of which discards half of the states in the database which are not close to \u03c8. We show that if \u03c8 is not close to any of the states in the database, then the algorithm has a high probability of success. As for the coherent state identification problem, we analyze the algorithm efficiency as a function of the distance in the quantum state space between \u03c8 and the states in the database, and show that it is a continuous function with a sharp threshold."}

{"text":"\nWe present a systematic experimental study of the spatial correlations in the dynamics of glassforming liquids. We determine the temperature dependence of the correlations in two ways. First, we measure the spatial correlation functions of the dynamics in glasses whose ordering is known to be temperature dependent, namely, SiO2 and B2O3. Second, we measure the temperature dependence of the amplitude of the peak in the spectrum of the autocorrelation function of the dynamics. We find that in both cases the temperature dependence is well described by a single parameter, the temperature at which the glass transition occurs. Our results suggest that the temperature dependence of the correlations in glassforming liquids is due to the fact that below the glass transition temperature the dynamics is influenced by the structure of the glass, whereas above the glass transition temperature the dynamics is independent of the structure. We discuss our results in the framework of current theories of the glass transition."}

{"text":"\n\nWe present a detailed study of the structure of the solar corona using multi-instrument observations from two spacecraft, the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) and the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), as well as from the Solar Prompt Ultraviolet and Transition Region Coronal Explorer (SPUTTER) sounding rocket. We use the newly obtained ultraviolet observations from SDO in combination with the photospheric and transition region data from SOHO and SPUTTER to investigate the velocity structure in the solar corona. We find that the wind velocity is typically 1-2 km s$^{-1}$ in the corona, but locally it can reach 5-6 km s$^{-1}$. The velocity distribution is different for small- and large-scale structures. Small-scale structures, which are mostly thermal in nature, have higher velocities, up to 6 km s$^{-1}$, whereas large-scale structures, which are often non-thermal, have velocities up to 2.5 km s$^{-1}$. The large-scale velocity structure is well described by a power law with a bulk velocity of 1.1 km s$^{-1}$ and a power law index of 1.2. We also find that the distribution of the velocity is inhomogeneous in the corona and that there is a clear dependence on the location with respect to the solar surface. The finding that the corona is structured on many different length scales and that the solar wind is not a fully fledged, steady wind, but rather a complex, structured flow, has important consequences for our understanding of the solar wind and its effects on the planets and the heliosphere."}
{"text":"\n\nAbstract\n\nIn the field of medical imaging, inverse problems arise when one wants to interpret the image data in order to answer a clinical question. For example, in X-ray tomography, the goal is to determine the internal 3D structure of an object from its 2D radiographic projection. Most of the tomographic algorithms assume that the X-ray intensity measured at each voxel of the image is proportional to the volume of the material in that voxel. In practice, however, the measurement is affected by the surrounding material, giving rise to artifacts. We propose a variational approach to solve this inverse problem by incorporating prior knowledge about the possible structure of the material. In particular, we assume that the X-ray attenuation coefficient is a linear combination of basis functions, where the basis functions are related to the structure of the material. By minimizing the difference between the measured data and the projection of the solution, we recover the coefficients of the basis functions and the internal structure of the material. Our approach is general and can be applied to various tomographic algorithms, such as filtered back projection or likelihood-based methods. We illustrate our approach on simulated data, and we apply it to clinical data sets to demonstrate its potential."}
{"text":"\nWe present results from a systematic study of the stability of magnetized spine-sheath relativistic jets in the presence of a static background magnetic field. We consider the jet to be a dilute, magnetized, collisionless, perfect-fluid, and describe it using the Gradient-Reretto-Mascarenhas-Horita-Dietrich (GRMHD) or Ret inclusively, for short, GRMHD) equations, which are a combination of the Gradient-Reexchange-Mascarenhas-Horita-Dietrich (GRMD) and the Riemann-Maxwell-H believ (RMHD) equations. The jets are found to be stable against mode coupling and nonlinear unstable disturbances. We find the critical value of the downstream magnetic field strength, below which the jet is unstable to become more magnetized, and the critical value of the jet's own magnetic field strength, above which the jet becomes unstable to depolarize. We also find the critical value of the jet's own magnetic field strength, below which the jet is unstable to become less magnetized. Our predictions for these critical values are in agreement with previous results obtained from full-f fluid simulations. We show that the GRMHD equations can be used to study the stability of magnetized jets in external magnetic fields."}

We find that depending on the level of noise, different scenarios may be observed. If the noise is small (i.e. the power spectral density is small compared to the driving frequency), then the system behaves as a quasi-periodic solid. A particular case is that of a system with several discrete levels of activity, in which the transition between levels may be associated with the occurrence of waves. If the noise is large, then the system behaves as a quasi-sinusoidally varying solid. We observe that waves may also propagate in this case, but their speed is smaller than in the case with small noise. We also find that in certain cases, the waves may become unstable against the background of the periodic forcing. We discuss the different scenarios and analyze the effects of the noise level and the parameters of the driving force on the propagation of the waves."}
{"text":"\nWe study a field theoretic model which can be thought of as an expansion of the Standard Model by a sector $g\\phi^4 + h\\phi^6$ with $g,h$ real and $\\phi$ a fundamental scalar. We show that this model in the 1+1d Euclidean space has a novel phase structure which includes a distinctive naked singularity. The model has an explicit supersymmetric quantum deformation theory with a certain 1d grand canonical group $G$. We show that the model has a particularity which relates to the real structure of $G$. This relates to the recent discussion in the literature on the relationship between the real and the imaginary parts of the field theoretic model. We show that the real part of the model is invariant under a special kind of external symmetry group $G^{\\rm ext}$ which turns on in a certain range of the moduli. We show further that this real part has a special relation to the dynamics of the model and in particular to the appearance of the naked singularity. We show finally that the imaginary part of the model is related to the internal symmetry group $G^{\\rm int}$ of the model and that this internal symmetry group is related to the breaking of the external symmetry group."}
{"text":"\n\nWe study the adiabatic motion of a relativistic charged particle in a uniform magnetic field, in the presence of a finite retarding potential. The system is shown to have two distinct regimes of motion, characterized by the violation of the relativistic energy conservation law and the creation of a real energy flow from the magnetic field to the particle. An exact analytical expression for the energy balance of the system is derived, and the role of the bare mass of the particle in the energy flow is discussed. We show that the violation of the energy conservation can be traced to the non-Abelian structure of the symplectic group, which acts as the infinitesimal generator of the relativistic particle's motion. The energy flow from the magnetic field to the particle is shown to be due to the non-trivial structure of the Casimir operator in the presence of the retarding potential, and a general method for the evaluation of the energy flow is discussed. We also show that the real energy flow has a simple geometric structure, which is related to the structure of the Casimir operator."}
{"text":"\nWe consider systematic corrections to the measured cosmological constant due to local inhomogeneities in the distribution of matter. We show that such corrections can be significant for a wide range of parameters, including those consistent with a flat universe. We derive a general expression for the correction, which can be evaluated numerically with a standard finite difference scheme. In the case of a flat universe with matter homogeneously distributed, the correction is shown to have a pure cosine form, with the amplitude depending only on the total matter density and the local matter density. The amplitude can be as large as several percent, and it is not suppressed by the horizon reentering the domain of the constant. For a universe with a simple power law profile for the matter distribution, we evaluate the correction analytically, and show that it is proportional to the inverse of the power law exponent. For more general profiles, the correction can be estimated using the cosine form, by introducing a spatial average density parameter $\\overline\\rho$ which is related to the local matter density $\\rho$ by a functional form which is consistent with the measured cosmological constant. We discuss the implications of this correction for future experiments, and for a deeper understanding of the nature of the cosmological constant."}
{"text":"\nWe present observations of the 3-He content in a large sample of Galactic sight lines, which together cover the full 360 deg^2 sky visible from the Northern Hemisphere. We find that the 3-He abundance in the interstellar medium (ISM) increases with radius in all directions, consistent with the expectation that the ISM is dynamically stratified and that the 3-He is concentrated in the inner regions. We find a mean 3-He abundance of 3.01 +1.08 (1\u03c3) x 10^-4, rising to 3.81 +1.08 (1\u03c3) x 10^-4 at a Galacto-centric distance of 8 kpc. This is consistent with the 3-He being produced in the galactic interior and radially diffusing outward. The mean relative abundance of 3-He with respect to H_2 is 5.4 +2.1 (1\u03c3) x 10^-4, but this ratio is not uniform. We find that the ratio is higher in the inner Galacto-centric distance range, and lower in the outer range, with a turnover at a Galacto-centric distance of  \u223c 6 kpc. This is consistent with the hypothesis that the 3-He is produced in the core and the diffuses outward, while the H_2 is produced in the outer Galaxy and diffuses inward. We find that the gas phase metallicity of the ISM is correlated with the 3-He abundance, with the 3-He being more abundant in gas of higher metallicity. We discuss this finding in the context of the relative metallicity of the gas phase and solid phase of the ISM. We find that the radial distribution of the 3-He in the ISM is consistent with the expectation that the 3-He is produced in the core and the outer regions of the Galaxy are not yet affected by the production. We discuss this in the context of the Galaxy's history and the evolution of the 3-He abundance in the ISM."}
{"text":"\n\nWe propose a new efficient method for detecting periodic orbits in a broad class of nonlinear maps and flows. Our method is based on the construction of a linearly dependent vector field with respect to the independent variables in the underlying differential equation. We show that this linearly dependent vector field is related to the periodic orbits in the original map or flow, and can be used to detect these orbits. The proposed method is not based on the assumption that the solution is a linear combination of known basis functions. Furthermore, our method does not require any knowledge of the nonlinearities in the map or flow, except for a general assumption that they are not too large. Finally, the proposed method is efficient in the sense that the computation of the linearly dependent vector field can be performed in $O(n^2)$ time, where $n$ is the dimension of the domain. The only additional step required is to perform a linear least-squares fit on the data points generated by the linearly dependent vector field. The proposed method is illustrated by detecting periodic orbits in several examples of chaotic maps and flows, and it is shown that the method is reliable and robust with respect to noise and small perturbations in the initial conditions."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present high-resolution imaging polarimetry of the nuclei of 25 nearby radio galaxies in the first (and most nearby) radio galaxy filament, using data obtained with the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) onboard the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). We find that the light emitted by the nuclear regions is highly polarized, with the percentage of linearly polarized light (PL) ranging from 60% to 80%. The degree of circular polarization (CP) of the light emitted by the nuclei is large ( ranging from 20% to 50% when defined as the fraction of the total light that is polarized in a right-handed direction), indicating that the geometry of the emission is very likely dominated by torus-like structures. We find that the nuclei of radio galaxies in the first filament, in particular those with higher optical luminosity, have a higher degree of polarization in their optical light than the nuclei of radio galaxies in the second filament, even after controlling for distance, radio power, and optical luminosity. Our results suggest that in addition to the torus-like structures revealed by the high degree of CP, the nuclear regions of radio galaxies also contain large amounts of polarized light that is ordered along the direction of the jet, probably due to interaction of the relativistic jet with the torus. We find a correlation between the magnetic field strength measured in the radio band and the degree of CP in the optical band, suggesting that the magnetic field is responsible for the CP structure. Our results also suggest that in radio galaxies the large-scale organization of the magnetic field is likely to be correlated with the large-scale structure of the torus."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present high-resolution {{{H}}^2}O observations of the gas in the circumnuclear region of M100 (NGC 4321), a giant molecular cloud and massive star-forming region. The data reveal complex non-circular motions in the ionized gas, which is likely to be driven by the collapse of the molecular cloud. The high-resolution data allow the study of kinematic structures on the scales of cloud fragments, providing a view of the dynamic Cloud Top Index (CTI). The ionized gas is found to be rotating in a wide range of velocity scales. We find three main kinematic components: (1) a slow-rotating component in the north-west part of the cloud, (2) a faster-rotating component in the southern part, and (3) a large-scale, relatively quiescent component in the central region. We find that the kinematic component in the southern part is likely to be a rotating bubble, the ionized gas in which is moving at a speed of about 15 km s$^{-1}$. In contrast, the velocity in the central, quiescent component is only about 3 km s$^{-1}$. The observed non-circularity could be explained by the motion of the cloud relative to the infalling matter, which may be the same mechanism that is producing the non-circular motions observed in the Orion and nearby clouds."}
{"text":"\nWe report on electronic spin transport and spin precession in single graphene layers at room temperature. We show that spin transport in graphene is governed by two different processes: a thermally driven one, related to the transport of charges, and a pure spin-driven one. By using a method based on spin-dependent total variation, we are able to separate the two contributions and to evaluate the thermal spin transport. We find that it is always superdiffusive, with a characteristic length that increases with the square of the thermal energy, in agreement with the predictions of a Boltzmann transport model. By using the same method we also measure the spin precession in a gated graphene layer, and we find that it is very fast, in agreement with theoretical predictions. We also show that the spin precession depends on the type of charge transport: it is faster when the charge transport is ballistic, and much slower when the charge transport is diffusive. This finding may be relevant for spintronic applications, where one has to control the spin precession by controlling the charge transport."}
{"text":"\nWe continue our study of Ising spin glass models versus Ising models on general graphs. We give a rigorous formulation and a detailed proof for the case of general graphs.

{"text":"\nWe propose a new method to test the radiative neutrino mass generation at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) by measuring the neutrino flux and the non-diffractive cross section with a detector that can observe the hadronization process. The hadronization process is expected to have a non-monotonic behavior as a function of the energy, due to the possible intervention of the neutrinos. The LHC is expected to have a sufficient statistics to measure the hadronization process with a detector placed near the hadronization region, such as the LHCb detector. The method does not require to know the neutrino mass and the mass hierarchy. The only required information is the absolute value of the neutrino mass, which can be obtained from the combination of the active and the passive detectors. We show that the Standard Model (SM) and the minimalist extensions of the SM predict different shapes for the non-diffractive cross section as a function of the energy. We evaluate the significance of the test for the minimal supersymmetric extension of the SM (MSSM) and for the two minimal extensions of the SM that generate a non-trivial neutrino mass (CERN-E and EPS).

{"text":"\n\nWe present photometric observations of the unique system SDSS J080531.84+481233.0 (hereafter J0805) in the course of four years, which show it to be a close binary consisting of an unresolved L dwarf and a T dwarf in a retrograde orbit. This is the first such system to be discovered. The two components are of similar brightness, which precludes resolving the system with current technology. We find that the orbital period is 1.14 \u00b1 0.09 days, the orbital eccentricity is 0.31 \u00b1 0.04, and the orbital inclination is 124.3 \u00b1 1.5 deg. We compute the masses of the two components to be 1.34 \u00b1 0.07 M\u2299 and 1.00 \u00b1 0.05 M\u2299 (both in the solar mass range), and the radii to be 1.63 \u00b1 0.02 R\u2299 and 1.25 \u00b1 0.01 R\u2299 (measured in solar radii). We estimate the age to be roughly 2 Gyr. We find that the T dwarf has a higher effective temperature than the L dwarf by about 3 kK, a difference that is not sufficient to account for the discrepancy in the observed radii. The spectral types of the two components are in agreement with the definition of the T dwarf spectral class in the former rather than the latter sense, with a spectral type of T6 \u00b1 1 (M6 in the old scheme) for the L dwarf and T7 \u00b1 1 (M7 in the old scheme) for the T dwarf. We estimate the metallicity to be [Fe\/H] \u2248 +0.1 for the L dwarf and [Fe\/H] \u2248 \u22120.5 for the T dwarf, both in agreement with the solar ratio.

{"text":"\n\nChemical evolution of the Small Magellanic Cloud based on planetary nebulae\nThe chemical composition of a galaxy's stars is a record of its history, which can be investigated by studying the elemental abundances of stellar populations. We have used high-resolution echelle spectroscopy of 12 planetary nebulae (PNe) in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) to determine the chemical abundances of the stars which gave rise to these PNe. This is the first study of the chemical evolution of the SMC based on a large sample of PNe. We have used the results to investigate the evolution of the metallicity of the stellar populations in the SMC. We find that there is a lack of agreement between the models and observations. The most metal-poor stars in the SMC, with [Fe\/H] > +0.2, are found to have [Fe\/H] < +0.5 in their planets. This discrepancy increases with metallicity, so that the most metal-rich stars in the SMC, with [Fe\/H] < -0.6, are found to have [Fe\/H] > -0.2 in their planets. We discuss various models which might explain this discrepancy. Our results are consistent with the idea that the lowest metallicity stars in the SMC have evolved from an chemically pristine gas, but that the majority of the stars in the SMC have been chemically polluted by successive generations of Type II supernovae, possibly from a single event."}
{"text":"\nWe present a quantum-optical scheme for generating a two-mode squeezed vacuum state with a prescribed energy density in one of the two modes. The scheme relies on a cross-gain modulation between a squeezed state of one color and a vacuum state of another color in a parametric amplifier. This approach is general and can be applied to any combination of frequencies for which a parametric amplifier with suitable nonlineity is available. We analyze the scheme in detail for the case of a yellow-green laser (frequency-doubled neodymium-yttrium-aluminium-garnet laser) and a red laser (HeNe laser). In this case, the cross-gain modulation is achieved by means of a Michelson interferometer with a Mach-Zehnder interferometer in one arm. We present a simple and general formula for the efficiency of the scheme as a function of the pump power and the interferometric settings. The efficiency can be made large by tuning the Michelson interferometer to obtain constructive interference in the parametric amplifier arm that contains the squeezed state. We also derive a simple formula for the energy flux in one of the two modes of the produced squeezed vacuum state. We analyze the formula and discuss the regime of parameter values in which the energy flux is finite. We finally present a simple formula for the energy density-flux product in the aforementioned regime. We show that this formula results in a unique value for the energy density-flux product in the squeezed vacuum state, which differs from the corresponding value in a classical vacuum state. We discuss possible physical meanings of this difference and its implications for the statistical properties of the vacuum state."}
{"text":"\n\nWe develop a microscopic theory of toroidal moments in bulk periodic crystals. We show that the existence of such toroidal moments can be related to the existence of non-zero three- and four-particle correlation functions. We demonstrate that a straightforward microscopic derivation of the toroidal moment theorem based on the single-particle basis renormalization technique can be used to evaluate the toroidal moments in a number of representative systems. We also propose a scheme to estimate the expectation values of the toroidal moments in any system in which the single-particle basis renormalization technique is applicable. Our derivation is based on a careful analysis of the three- and four-particle correlation functions in the presence of a static magnetic field, which can be applied to any system for which the single-particle basis renormalization technique is applicable. We believe that this theory will be useful in the evaluation of the toroidal moments in arbitrary lattices, as well as in the analysis of the single-particle basis renormalization technique in the presence of a static magnetic field."}
{"text":"\nWe present new proper motion data for about one million stars in the Galactic bulge, obtained from the European Space Agency's Hipparchus mission. Proper motions in the bulge are dominated by large-scale streaming motions of the hydrogen and metal-poor old stars, with a different kinematic structure in the southern and northern halves. We show that the Galactic potential field in the bulge is well described by two superposed potentials, which explains the difference in the velocity fields in the two halves. We also present a model in which the radial velocity distribution of young stars is fit to the observed proper motions. This model indicates that the young stars in the bulge are confined to a thin layer, most probably related to the Galactic disk. We show that the radial velocity distribution of both old and young stars is consistent with a galactic fountain model in which the stars are upward-accelerated by supernova explosions in the Galactic center. Our data set also contains a significant number of high-velocity stars, which are likely to be members of the Galactic globular clusters. The proper motion of these stars is inconsistent with the assumption of a static cluster, and they must have been perturbed by the Galactic potential. We discuss the implications of our findings for the structure and dynamics of the Galactic bulge, and for Galactic evolution."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present here the first large, uniform, and statistically significant sample of tidal dwarf galaxies (TDGs) observed with the Hubble Space Telescope, the Wide Field Camera 3, and the Advanced Camera for Surveys. The sample consists of 86 galaxies with photometric redshifts in the range 0.155 < z_phot < 1.5. We have derived the dynamical redshift for each galaxy in the sample, using the galaxy's local group velocity from the Virial Stampede algorithm. We find that the agreement between the observed distribution of stellar mass in the TDGs and the prediction of the theory of Cold Dark Matter (CDM) is very good, provided that the small fraction of TDGs with extremely high orbital dynamics is excluded from the analysis. We show that this small fraction can be explained by the presence of massive central stars, which provide a torque that counteracts the gravitational pull of the larger galaxy that the TDG is orbiting. We discuss the implications of our results for the fundamental physics of CDM and find that the theory can produce the observed distribution of stellar mass in TDGs, provided that (1) there is a significant stellar mass in the vast majority of the galaxies and (2) the probability of having a massive central star is small."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a cosmological model that challenges the need for a cosmological constant in a universe with a flat space-time. Our model comprises a modified Einstein-Maxwell-Chern-Weinberg action with a cosmological constant that is absent from the dynamics, thus making the evolution of space-time effectively homeless. We show that this model is capable of producing the large-scale structure of the universe observed today, including the cosmic microwave background radiation, the large-scale galaxy distribution, and the cosmic hydrogen abundance, without the need for a cosmological constant or any other ad-hoc mechanism. We also show that the model can produce a broad range of small-scale structure, including the power spectrum of galaxies, galaxy spin-trails, and the distribution of intergalactic hydrogen, without recourse to a scale-invariant cosmological constant or any other ad-hoc mechanism. We show that the model's dynamics is driven by a combination of the ad-hoc cosmological constant and the dynamics of the Einstein-Maxwell-Chern-Weinberg action, which results in a universe that is scale-invariant and therefore free from the scale- hierarchies that appear in the data. Our model thus provides a simple and elegant explanation for the origin of the large-scale structure of the universe and the small-scale structure within it, without the need for a cosmological constant or any other ad-hoc mechanism."}
{"text":"\nWe propose a modification to the standard cosmological model of a self-accelerating universe, in which the accelerating expansion is due to a constant density of repulsive gravity sources, distributed homogeneously in space.

We find that in this model, the evolution of the universe is characterized by the formation and evolution of large-scale structures, such as sheets, bubbles, and voids, in a manner analogous to the way in which the evolution of the universe is currently thought to be characterized by the formation and evolution of large-scale structures, such as superclusters, voids, and sheets. Our results suggest that, rather than being due to a constant density of point-like repulsive gravity sources, the accelerating expansion of the universe may be due to a constant density of extended, low-power, localized sources of repulsive gravity."}
{"text":"\nWe show that the power spectrum sensitivity to primordial non-Gaussianity is limited by the cumulative gravity-dark energy evolution during inflation. We find that for scales smaller than the inflationary wavelength, the power spectrum is very sensitive to the initial conditions, whereas for larger scales the power spectrum is much less sensitive. Therefore, the primordial non-Gaussianity can have a spectrum with very sharp power-law cutoff at a scale larger than the inflationary wavelength, but the resulting power spectrum can be well described by a stretched exponential with the cutoff scale much larger than the inflationary scale. Our result is consistent with the lack of evidence for primordial non-Gaussianity so far. \n\nWe also study the power spectrum sensitivity to the initial conditions in the slow-rolling approximation.

{"text":"\n\nWe present photometric and spectroscopic observations of the Leo Elliptical NGC 3379, which is known to contain a large population of metal-poor stars. Our high-resolution spectroscopic observations reveal the presence of two distinct stellar populations in the nuclear region, which are distinct from the main body of the galaxy: an old population with average [Fe\/H] \u2248 +0.4 and a younger population with average [Fe\/H] \u2248 +0.9. The old population appears to be physically associated with the elliptical's central radio source, whereas the younger population appears to be an accretion feature. We determine the metal content of the two stellar populations by comparing the observed Fe II lines with models of stellar atmospheres, and find that the old population is <5% of the metal content found in solar spectra, whereas the younger population is at least 10% of the solar metal content. The observed distribution of the two stellar populations is consistent with a central point source (old population) and a ring-like structure (younger population) superimposed on the main body of the galaxy. Our photometric and kinematic measurements of the stellar populations in the nuclear region are consistent with a hierarchical structure, in which the old population forms a central mass concentration and the younger population forms a ring-like structure. We estimate the total stellar mass of the two populations to be Mstellar \u2248 1.8 \u00d7 108 M\u2299. This represents an increase of \u2248 4% in the total stellar mass of the system, suggesting that the recent history of the Leo Elliptical is characterized by accretion events. We discuss a possible scenario that explains the observations, in which a low-mass halo or a globular cluster enters the system and disrupts the nuclear region, forming the observed features."}

The long axis is aligned with the local galactic plane at a position angle of 133 deg. The gas distribution in the elliptical is approximately axially symmetric. The star formation efficiency is 1.7 per cent. We find 21 candidate Halo Stars in the NGC 3377. The photometry of the candidate Halo Stars is consistent with a range of physical conditions. We have derived a correlation between the H-alpha and H-beta magnitudes for the candidate Halo Stars. The correlation can be described by a power law, y = a xb, where y is the H-beta magnitude, x is the H-alpha magnitude and a and b are the power law exponents. We have compared the H-alpha and H-beta magnitudes of the Halo Stars in NGC 3377 with those of the Milky Way globular cluster M13. The magnitudes of the candidate Halo Stars are on average fainter than those of M13 in both filters. This is consistent with the Halo Stars in NGC 3377 being older and cooler than those in M13. We have found a single candidate extremely metal-poor star in NGC 3377, which is the faintest and coolest star in the elliptical. We discuss the possible physical properties of the candidate Halo Stars in NGC 3377 and place the observations in the context of recent theoretical work on the formation and evolution of globular clusters and the Halo."}

{"text":"\nWe study the dynamics of a semiconductor superlattice (SL) placed in a tilted magnetic field. We consider the SL as a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) with additional degrees of freedom given by the superlattice periodicity. Our main results are (i) a detailed classification of the different types of dynamical regimes, (ii) a thorough study of the impact of a transverse electric field on the dynamics, and (iii) a description of the governors of the different regimes in terms of simple stoichiometric models. In particular, we show that a tilted magnetic field can induce a transition from a regular ( bibliographically known) dynamics to a variety of different types of chaotic dynamics, which can be distinguished from each other by an appropriate choice of the model parameter values. Our analysis also reveals the existence of a novel type of regime, which we call complex periodic, in which the SL supports simultaneously a regular and a chaotic dynamics, each of them being in a different degree of complexity. We show that this complex periodic regime can be approached from the regular and from the chaotic regimes by a gradual tuning of the model parameters. We also show that a certain type of chaos, called hyperchaos, can be obtained by a specific choice of the model parameters.

We use the Millennium Simulation, a large scale cosmological hydrodynamical simulation including both dark matter and gas, with a resolution of $44\\,$hMpc, which can be used to study the formation history of galaxies up to redshift $z\\sim 1$. In our analysis we identify satellite galaxies using three different methods, and use the galaxy membership probabilities to derive the satellite metallicity and star formation density distribution. We find that the satellite galaxy population as a whole is very metal-poor and displays a star formation density excess of $\\sim 30\\%$ with respect to the main galaxy population, but the satellites of individual galaxies show much larger differences, up to an excess of $\\sim 300\\%$. We find that the stellar mass of the largest satellite in a system is proportional to the stellar mass of the main galaxy, and we show this relation to be consistent with the prediction of the Barred-iminicity theory of galaxy formation. We also analyse the formation of fossil groups, and find that the probability of a group of galaxies to be fossil is inversely proportional to the group mass. We discuss our results in the context of theories of galaxy formation and the formation history of the Local Volume Group."}
{"text":"\nWe present the results of a systematic investigation of the dynamics of fibrils in the solar chromosphere in the H-alpha and C IV wavelength domains. We found that in both cases the fibrils show a high degree of organization, with a distinct correlation between the location of the dynamic features and the large-scale structure. In the case of H-alpha, we observe a strong correlation between the dynamic and the large-scale features in the form of long-range, nearly perfect, linear correlations. We show that the spatial correlation function can be well described by a cosine function with a correlation length of about 1.5 Mm, and we demonstrate that the apparent non-correlation between the dynamic and the large-scale structure in the spatial domain can be healed by considering the velocity space. In the case of C IV, the dynamic features are less distinct and show only a weak correlation with the large-scale structure. The dynamic range in C IV is, however, larger than in H-alpha, indicating that the temperature is higher in C IV than in H-alpha. We also found that the dynamic structures in both wavelength domains show a clear signature of turbulence."}
{"text":"\n\nWe investigate the relation between the spin- and triplet-flavor of massive ( Nuevaola-BO1957 and Heisenberg-OULAMP ) and massless ( ABENGOA-DELGADO-OLIVA-RODRIGUEZ-VAZQUEZ-CUENCA ) triplons in spatially anisotropic frustrated antiferromagnets. The formalism is based on the notion of tripletons (or triplons) and spinons, which are respectively the massive and massless excitation associated with the triplet and spin degrees of freedom of the magnetic system. We show that the triplon-spinon correspondence is different in a frustrated antiferromagnet than in a regular one, due to the appearance of exotic massive and massless excitations, named here massive and massless triplons, in the thermodynamic limit. In particular, the massive triplon is a genuinely massive excitation, while the massless triplon is a genuine massless excitation, but with a finite lifetime. We show further that the lifetime of the massless triplon is related to the dynamical properties of the spin degree of freedom, in contrast to the massless spinon, for which this degree of freedom is always frozen."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a detailed Fourier analysis of plage in active regions (ARs) and investigate the physical origin of the frequency-dependent optical depths. We use a new algorithm that combines spectral synthesis with a multitaper method to obtain the power spectrum of plage intensity. The analysis reveals that the plage spectrum has a cut-off frequency that depends on the magnetic flux and the geometry of the AR. The low-frequency limit of the plage spectrum is consistent with a spectrum that can be described by a single power law. We show that a simple model in which the frequency-dependent absorption is caused by the superposition of plage along magnetic field lines can quantitatively reproduce the shape of the plage spectrum. Within this model the absorption is caused by an impedance miss-match between the plage and the background plasma. We determine the scaling of the plage spectrum by fitting our model to the low-frequency regime of the plage spectrum. We find that the plage spectrum is well described by a power law with a cut-off frequency that depends on the magnetic flux and geometry of the AR."}

{"text":"\n\nNode-based interactions are central to a wide range of applications, including collaboration networks, protein interaction networks, and communication networks. We consider a specific class of node-based interactions, namely encounter-based interactions, in which the activity of each node depends only on its current neighbors. We propose a simple model in which each node keeps track of the number of its neighbors and the sum of their activities. The node then uses these quantities to determine its own activity. We show that this model is capable of producing a wide range of complex behavior, such as power-law degree distributions and small-world properties, while remaining analytically tractable. We use this model to analyze two real-world networks, namely the collaboration network of scientific papers and the calling network of mobile phones, and show that our model is able to reproduce a variety of features present in these networks. We also use our model to analyze a synthetic network in which the node attributes are generated according to a probability distribution, and show that our model is able to extract meaningful information about this distribution from the activity of the nodes. Our work suggests that encounter-based interactions can be a powerful and analytically tractable abstraction of node-based interactions."}
{"text":"\n\nThe Chemical Compositions of the Type II Cepheids -- The BL Her and W Vir Variables\n\nThe chemical compositions of 31 type II Cepheids (14 BL Her and 17 W Vir variables) are presented. These data are used to discuss the relation between chemical composition and the period-color magnitude diagram. It is shown that the classical P-M diagram can be used to estimate the metallicities of type II Cepheids. The mean metallicity of the BL Her variables is found to be very close to solar, a result which is consistent with their very low peculiar-velocity orbits. The average metallicities of the W Vir variables are also close to solar, indicating that these stars have relatively low-metal winds. However, the properties of some of these stars are inconsistent with the assumption that all W Vir variables have low-metal winds. It is suggested that the W Vir variables form a chemically heterogeneous group. The membership in the different chemical groups defined here is consistent with the available evolutionary theory. The relatively low metallicities of the type II Cepheids imply that these stars have had a relatively low-metal accretion history. The results are consistent with the relatively high metallicities found for the type I Cepheids, indicating a different chemical history for these two populations."}
{"text":"\n\nHot Topics from the BABAR Experiment\n\nWe present some of the latest results from the BABAR experiment, a large-scale collaborative effort to study the weak interactions of the nucleon and the electroweak interactions of heavy quarks. The motivation for the research is the desire to better understand the weak interactions and the nature of the quarkonium. The key ideas and methodology are to use a precise, high statistics experiment to study the weak interactions in a model-independent way, and to search for new, heavy quarkonia states. The results obtained are the most precise measurement of the weak matrix elements of the nucleon, and the first observation of a new, heavy quarkonia state. The practical application of the results is to better understand the weak interactions and to possibly use the quarkonia as a resource for quantum information processing. The theoretical applications are to test quantum gravity theories that predict new quarkonia states, and to better understand the quarkonium."}
{"text":"\n\nPower Allocation for Discrete-Input Delay-Limited Fading Channels\n\nWe consider the problem of power allocation for discrete-input delay-limited (DIDL) fading channels. In this problem, the transmitter has a finite set of discrete signal levels and the channel is characterized by a real positive scalar fading gain. The goal is to design a power allocation strategy such that the average distortion is minimized. We show that for a large class of fading channels, this problem can be simplified to a power allocation strategy for a reference channel without fading. This enables us to obtain an outer-bound on the achievable performance, which is then used to design a near-optimal power allocation strategy. The strategy is shown to achieve a performance close to the outer-bound, while having a substantially lower complexity. The strategy is applicable to both single-user and multi-user scenarios, and is shown to achieve almost the same performance as the case with an infinite set of discrete signal levels."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate the origin of slow thermal variations observed in the Sun's photosphere and chromosphere. We find that the most likely explanation is thermal micropulsations (TM) with a variety of temporal scales, the most prominent being half-hour oscillations. We show that such oscillations can be excited by a resonance of the thermal creeping flow with the solar rotation, provided that the temperature is higher at the photosphere than in the convection zone below, such as in the case of thermal subsidences. We find that the frequency of these oscillations is related to the spatial variations of the temperature in the convection zone, and that this relation is consistent with a simple model in which the convection zone is treated as a single, large-scale cell. The model predicts that the oscillation frequency depends only on the dimension of the convection zone, not on the details of the temperature distribution within it. We show that this prediction is consistent with the observations, which can be explained by a wide variety of convection zone temperature distributions, as long as the convection zone is sufficiently deep. We further show that the amplitude of the oscillations depends on the detailed temperature distribution in the convection zone, such that a small variation in this distribution can excite large oscillations. This may be relevant to the recently discovered gravitational signatures of large-scale TM, which appear to be sensitive to the temperature distribution in the convection zone."}
{"text":"\nWe consider the structure of the phase spaces of relativistic theories of gravity and their implications for the structure of spacetime. In particular, we show that the presence of an attractor in the phase space of a relativistic theory of gravity leads to a gravitational singularity. We then consider the possibility of eliminating this singularity by modifying the structure of the phase space. We show that this can be achieved by introducing a phase space parasite, which we call a ``hole,'' that eats away the singularity. We analyze the properties of this hole and show that it is stable against small perturbations in the parameters of the theory. We also show that the hole is as effective at communicating gravitational forces as the original singularity, and thus does not affect the predictions of the theory except at the singularity. We conclude by considering the physical implications of this hole, and discuss a possible experimental signature that could be used to test whether a theory with a hole is preferred over a theory with a singularity."}
{"text":"\nWe consider a recently proposed model of analog neural networks with synaptic noise inspired on the Bi-fica model and study the effect of temporal fluctuations in the strength of synaptic connections on the dynamics of the network. We show that the addition of even small amounts of noise can dramatically affect the qualitative behavior of the network, leading to the transition from ordered to chaotic behavior. In particular, we show that the introduced noise can destroy the underlying symmetry of the dynamics, even if this symmetry is not present in the synaptic connectivity. In addition, we show that a special class of symmetries, which we call Almost Symmetric, can be robust to small amounts of synaptic noise, in the sense that the dynamics keeps a symmetry of this type, even if the underlying synaptic connectivity does not have it. Our results are consistent with the idea that a key feature in the development of order and symmetry in biological neural systems could be the relative absence of synaptic noise."}
{"text":"\n\nWe give a simple description of the geometry of exceptional secant planes of a curve in the projective plane. The curve is assumed to be general, that is, having no special symmetry, but the description makes use of a linear series along the curve.\n\nWe first recall the definition of exceptional secant planes. Let P(V) be a plane in the projective plane which is not contain in any symmetry of the curve. We can always find a transversal to P(V) which intersect the curve in two points, called the exceptional points of P(V). The exceptional secant plane of P(V) is the plane through the exceptional points, orthogonal to P(V).\n\nWe show that the exceptional secant planes can be completely described using only the main symmetry of the curve, up to an orthogonal transformation. We then describe the exceptional secant planes using the symmetry of the curve together with a linear series along the curve. This description is not unique, but it has a simple and conceptual interpretation.\n\nFinally, we show that the exceptional secant planes are a generalization of the secant planes of a curve, which can be described using only the main symmetry of the curve up to an orthogonal transformation.\n\nOur results have no practical application. They are of purely theoretical interest, in the sense that they provide a geometrically simple description of an object which is conceptually not too far from the basic objects of geometry, that is, planes and curves in the projective plane."}
{"text":"\n\nWe show that the higher-dimensional formulation of Einstein's equations, in a suitable choice of coordinates, can be exactly solved for a Schwarzschild black hole, with the solution describing an N-species  fluids interpretation of a black hole, in a large N limit. This is done by an integral transform of the Einstein equations which has as its kernel the species kernel of the Poincare group. This formulation allows a solution of the Einstein equations for an N-species fluids system which asymptotically approaches the solution for a black hole in the limit N \u2192 \u221e. We solve this system of equations numerically in the limit N = 1000, in a grid size independent of the mass M and radius R of the black hole, and find a very good agreement with the exact solution for a Schwarzschild black hole, given in terms of the geodesic collision coordinates. Our result is independent of the choice of the initial conditions, which is an interesting feature of the solution. We discuss the physical and mathematical meanings of our result, in the framework of the Large N approach to quantum gravity."}

The processes are defined by the system of balance laws which conserve the energy only in the thermodynamic sense. The special cases of the Marcus-Lushnikov processes are the conservative processes, the Smoluchowski and Flory models.

{"text":"\n\nWe present a hybrid N-body algorithm for the efficient simulation of star clusters and their parent galaxies. The algorithm combines two distinct methods: a tree-based method for the self-consistent solution of the gravitational field, and a direct method for the calculation of the motion of the particles. We show that such a hybrid algorithm is necessary for the reliable and efficient simulation of the dynamics of star clusters and their parent galaxies. In particular, we show that the use of a direct-only method without a tree-based method leads to the inefficient evaluation of the gravitational field and the need to introduce artificial viscosity in order to obtain reliable results. We also show that the use of a tree-based method without a direct method is not able to provide a fully self-consistent solution of the gravitational field. We present a detailed analysis of the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, and show that it is able to produce reliable results for star clusters and galaxies, without the need to introduce artificial viscosity. We also present a comparison with other hybrid algorithms that combine a tree-based method with a direct method.

{"text":"\nWe present BubbleSched, a portable framework for building thread schedulers for hierarchical multiprocessors. It comprises a hardware abstraction layer and a reusable library of software components that can be combined in different ways to create different thread schedulers. BubbleSched is based on a hierarchical scheduling architecture that maps threads to a hierarchy of execution bubbles. A bubble is a container for a group of threads and is the basic unit of execution. The hierarchy of bubbles is mapped to the hierarchy of processors in the system. Threads within a bubble can be executed concurrently, but execution bubbles themselves are scheduled serially. A thread is executed using a sequence of execution bubbles that share the thread's resource requirements and memory state. The key idea is that different scheduling policies can be implemented by dynamically associating threads to bubbles, and by configuring the manner in which bubbles are scheduled. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by implementing several example schedulers, including a conventional multiprocessor OS thread scheduler, a task-based thread scheduler, and an event-driven concurrent programming model. Our results show that by exploiting the hierarchy of processors, BubbleSched can effectively reduce the overheads associated with scheduling threads and managing their resource requirements."}
{"text":"\nWe present a method to probe CP violation in neutrino oscillations using neutrino telescopes. We consider a narrow-band neutrino source, such as a nuclear reactor or a plasma created by a lightning strike, which produces both direct detection and oscillation of neutrinos. The main idea is to measure the arrival time distribution of the neutrinos at the telescope and to use the correlation between the phase of the oscillating neutrinos and the direction of their propagation to determine the sign of the neutrino helicity. The sign of the helicity is related to the violation of CP in the neutrino sector. We show that a discovery potential of $3\\sigma$ for a $30\\%$ confidence level in the helicity could be achieved with the IceCube neutrino telescope and a $10^{52}$ eV neutrino source located at a distance of $500\\,{\\rm km}$ from the detector.

{"text":"\nWe consider the Bianchi model of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization. This model is able to explain the large scale structure of the CMB polarization, the Nadal-Christiansen (NC) effect, and the sources of the CMB anomalies, such as the cold spot and the warm spot, in a self-consistent way. The key idea is that, while the large scale structure is due to the actual physical Bianchi model, the origin of the NC effect and of the CMB anomalies are related to the fact that the Bianchi model is recovered from the real CMB observations only after a joint fit with a linear polarizer, i.e., a two-stage procedure. The main drawback of this model is that it requires a physical Bianchi model with two different inflationary epochs with different physical properties, in order to reproduce the CMB observations. We analyze this model in the framework of the slow-rolling model, assuming the presence of a potential field, and discuss the problem of the slow-rolling parameters determination."}
{"text":"\nWe consider a diffusive planar streamer instability driven by the Laplacian term in the equations of hydrodynamics. The analysis is based on the idea of the so-called pulled front method, which enables one to study the streamer dynamics in the presence of an external force that acts to pull the front in the direction of the instability growth. The main aim of this work is to determine the necessary and sufficient conditions for the unbounded growth of the instability and the corresponding properties of the limit cycle, as well as to discuss the properties of the most unstable regime of the Laplacian instability. We show that the most unstable regime corresponds to the case when the strength of the pulling force is small compared to the front's growth rate. In this case, the corresponding limit cycle is a thin, long and very sensitive structure, which is able to be quickly excited by a small perturbation. The theoretical results are illustrated by numerical simulations in a simple model problem."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present molecular line opacities for low-mass metal-poor AGB stars undergoing the Third Dredge Up. The molecular line spectra of 19 stars observed with the aim of detecting HCO were analyzed to derive the strengths of the fundamental lines in the regions where these are not affected by blending with lines from other regions. We derive a relationship between the opacities of the fundamental lines and the corresponding effective temperatures. The derived relation, based on a fit to a double log-normal distribution, shows that the extinction in the fundamental lines is between 2 and 12 percent, with a mean value of 5 percent. The corresponding variance is between 0.4 and 1.4 percent, with a mean value of 0.8 percent. The accuracy of the derived molecular opacities is comparable with that of previous analyses based on observations of high-mass stars. The molecular opacities are consistent with a distribution that has a scale height of 1.5 km, in agreement with previous analyses. We discuss the effect of non-LTE effects on the derived molecular opacities, and find that these can be neglected. We show that the molecular line spectra contain information on the relative strengths of the different atomic lines."}
{"text":"\n\nDark Matter Annihilation in Substructures Revised\n\nWe have developed a model of dark matter (DM) annihilation in small substructures that are embedded in a larger three-dimensional (3D) structure.

{"text":"\n\nThe Lower Mass Function of the Young Open Cluster Blanco 1: from 30 Mjup to 3 Mo\n\nWe present photometric observations of the young open cluster Blanco 1 made with the Hubble Space Telescope to study the cluster's lower mass function in the mass range from 30 Mjup to 3 Mo. Our analysis shows a significant under-abundance of massive stars in Blanco 1 compared to the predictions of the linear metallicity-mass relation for star formation, particularly for stars in the range 30 < log(M\/M\u2299) < 1.5. The under-abundance is even more pronounced if the corrected mass function of the solar neighbourhood is used as the benchmark, which suggests that massive stars in Blanco 1 are less massive than their main sequence turn-off mass. We also find a clear over-abundance of low-mass stars in the cluster compared to the local mass function, but this may be due to contamination from field stars. The ratio of massive stars to low-mass stars in Blanco 1 is consistent with the predictions of theinitial mass function for a cluster born with a turn-off mass of 1.4\u20131.5 M\u2299. We therefore suggest that the main mechanism responsible for the formation of massive stars in clusters is the accretion of gas onto the most massive seeds, provided that these seeds are massive enough, rather than the competitive accretion of many small seeds. The study of the low mass function of clusters is important for understanding the process of star formation in general, and particularly for testing the theory of competitive accretion."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider a ring made of a bilayer of graphene, in which a gap is opened by removing a strip of material in one of the layers. We find a novel type of Aharonov-Bohm effect, in which the orbital motion of an electron in the ring is influenced by the break in the lattice at the gap, leading to a violation of the principles of quantum mechanics. The effect is analogous to the way in which a particle's path is affected by a discontinuity in a potential field, but in this case the effect is due to the particular structure of the electron's wave function, which is related to the topological properties of the graphene lattice. The Aharonov-Bohm effect is most dramatic when the size of the gap is comparable to the phase coherence length of the electron, which depends on the frequency of its motion. We also consider the case of a single layer graphene ring, and show that in this case the Aharonov-Bohm effect is much weaker, because the ring has a valley-degeneracy, meaning that an electron moving around the ring has multiple different wave functions that are equally valid. The Aharonov-Bohm effect can be understood as a way to resolve the valley-degeneracy, by breaking the symmetry of the ring and introducing a preferred wave function for the electron to occupy. Our results suggest that the Aharonov-Bohm effect could be used as a way to control the properties of graphene devices, by introducing small breaks in the lattice in specific locations."}
{"text":"\n\nTraffic on DNA is a problem for any molecular motor that wants to move along it and produce RNA. In especially crowded regions, such as gene promoters, the motion of RNA polymerase can be restricted, resulting in pausing or stalling of the motor. This in turn can lead to the concentration of polymerase enzymes in these areas, which can lead to further congestion. We have developed a stochastic model that describes the motion of RNA polymerase as a random walk on DNA, incorporating various types of stall behavior. In this paper, we investigate the effects of polymerase stalling on the production of RNA. We find that the effect is quite dramatic in some cases, with several-fold increases in RNA concentration in regions of polymerase stalling. We also find that the effects are quite position dependent, with different motors being affected in different ways by the same DNA sequence. We discuss the relevance of our results to possible experimental observations, and we consider the effect of dynamic modifications to the DNA substrate on motor behavior."}
{"text":"\n\nIRAS08281-4850 and IRAS14325-6428: two A-type post-AGB stars with s-process enrichment\nWe present an analysis of the chemical and physical properties of two A-type post-asymptotic giant branch (post-AGB) stars: IRAS08281-4850 and IRAS14325-6428. These two stars are particularly interesting because they contain large amounts of s-process-enriched material. The s-process is the mechanism by which many elements are created from unstable nuclei which have acquired extra neutrons, and these elements are then distributed into the interstellar medium by the violent ends of stellar life. Because of the importance of the s-process in understanding the chemical evolution of the Galaxy, and because of the very low yields of the s-process in our Galaxy, these two objects are of great interest.\nWe find that the chemical compositions of these stars are very different from each other. The dominant element in IRAS08281-4850 is Fe, which may have been produced by the r-process. The r-process is the mechanism by which unstable nuclei which have acquired extra protons are converted into stable nuclei with the same number of protons but more neutrons. We also find that the chemical composition of IRAS14325-6428 resembles the s-process enrichment observed in SN 1987A. The physical properties of both stars are very different. IRAS08281-4850 is a massive object with a low density and a large temperature, while IRAS14325-6428 is a relatively small object with a high density and a low temperature. We suggest that these two objects are at very different evolutionary stages, with IRAS08281-4850 being very massive and very hot, and IRAS14325-6428 being relatively small and cool. We discuss the possible evolutionary histories of these two objects, and the possible mechanisms by which they acquired their distinctive chemical compositions."}

{"text":"\n\nWe have carried out a systematic study of the high-resolution photometry of the contact binary star HD 73526. We find that the photometric brightness of this star is very stable, with a standard deviation of 0.03 mag. This result indicates that the system is in radiative equilibrium, in spite of the fact that the visible companion is a giant star with a temperature about half that of the Sun. The high stability of the brightness is probably due to the large orbital period (55.4 min), which leads to very small orbital derivatives. The equilibrium temperature of the companion is derived to be about 6,000 K, which is consistent with the temperature of a red giant of spectral type K. The contact binary nature of this system is confirmed by the large variations in the radial velocity, which exhibit a strong sinusoidal pattern. A period analysis of the radial velocity data set yields a complete harmonic series, the first five terms of which are in good agreement with a contact binary model in which the two stars are separated by a disk of sublimed matter. The method of observation and analysis used in this study is a powerful tool for the study of close binary systems. \n\n(Hleney, 1993) \n\nThe stability and formation of the resonant system HD 73526 is investigated. We find that the system is stable against a wide range of initial conditions and parameter variations. The only stable configuration is a contact binary with two stars of equal mass and a separation of 0. We discuss the possible formation scenarios of this system and conclude that the most likely one is the three-body encounter. We also show that the tidal interaction between the components is very small and that the system can be treated as a two-body problem. The analysis of the stability of the system is based on the method ofasyncronous substitution, which is also used to evaluate the tidal interaction."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider a family of generalized spin glasses with long-range interactions and study the Universality of the REM (Response to External Fields) for their dynamics. We show that, for glasses whose symmetry is not too badly broken by the external fields, the dynamics is described by a set of master equations which are symmetric under the action of the internal symmetry group of the glass. This symmetry is not an exact one however, and is modified by a certain form of theuidyl representation. Our results are consistent with a large number of exactly solvable models which can be thought of as \"derived\" from the master equations by a process of \" froze-in\" symmetry breaking.

{"text":"\nWe present factorization analysis for the fragmentation functions of hadrons containing a heavy quark. The motivation for the research is that the heavy quark fragmentation functions are crucial for an understanding of the hadronization process and the structure of hadrons containing a heavy quark. The key ideas and methodology are that we use the factorization method, which has been well-established for the fragmentation functions of hadrons containing a light quark, to the fragmentation functions of hadrons containing a heavy quark. As the heavy quark fragmentation functions are known to be related to the quark distribution in hadrons, we evaluate the heavy quark fragmentation functions by the use of the quark distribution in hadrons. The results obtained are that we succeed in the extraction of the heavy quark fragmentation functions from the quark distribution in hadrons. The problem this work attempts to solve is that the fragmentation functions of hadrons containing a heavy quark are not well understood. The practical application of this work is that the fragmentation functions of hadrons containing a heavy quark are important for an understanding of the hadronization process and the structure of hadrons containing a heavy quark, which in turn are important for an understanding of the early universe and the structure of the cosmic microwave background radiation. The theoretical application of this work is that the factorization analysis for the fragmentation functions of hadrons containing a heavy quark is an important step for the construction of a theory of the hadronization process and the structure of hadrons containing a heavy quark."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present photometric and spectroscopic observations of the pre-main sequence M1 dwarf LHS 1070 in an attempt to constrain the evolutionary state of this triple system. The two closer components, LHS 1070 A and B, display the characteristics of young, solar-type objects in a close orbit with a short orbital period (83 min), while the more distant component, LHS 1070 C, displays a spectral type that is unusual for a solar twin, with a relatively strong magnetic field (B = 2.6 kG) and a line-of-sight velocity that implies a mass fraction of >70% (by comparison, the solar ratio is approximately 1%). We find that the observed physical properties of the system are consistent with a bound system with the following evolutionary state: LHS 1070 A and B are in a wide orbit around a cool dwarf star (M1) with a low magnetic field (B < 1.5 kG) and a period of approximately 2 kyr. The M1 dwarf has a mass fraction of <30% and has been leaking angular momentum to its companions in a prograde fashion, resulting in the current wide orbit and short orbital period. The low magnetic field of the M1 dwarf is the result of either an initial field that has been diluted by the accretion of a non-magnetic companion or the simple cooling and shrinking of the initial magnetic field as the M1 dwarf has evolved off the main sequence. We have identified only one other triple system with a similar orbital configuration (LHS 3844), although we note that the current orbits in LHS 3844 are not well known. We discuss a number of other possible evolutionary states that are consistent with the available observations. In particular, we suggest that the system has probably evolved from a configuration with two or more brown dwarfs in a wide orbit around a more massive object (M>M1) and that the brown dwarfs have been captured into a much tighter orbit as a result of gravitational interactions."}
{"text":"\nWe present a multidimensional data redistribution scheme for dynamically redistributing a large amount of data among multiple processors in a parallel computation. Our scheme is motivated by the need to support dynamic resizing of parallel computations, in which the number of processors may be increased or decreased during the course of the computation. We focus on minimizing the amount of data movement required to support such resizing, while also minimizing the amount of space required to store the redistributed data. Our approach is to use a hierarchical redistributing strategy, in which processors at one level of the hierarchy are used to redistribute data among processors at the next level of the hierarchy. This strategy is applied iteratively until the data is finally redistributed among the processors at the lowest level of the hierarchy. The data redistribution is designed to be efficient, in the sense that each processor receives a large fraction of the data that it will need to compute its portion of the solution, while also minimizing the amount of data stored on each processor. We evaluate the efficiency of our scheme by measuring the amount of data movement and space required for the redistribution, as well as the overhead imposed by the redistribution process. We also present a simple model of the redistributing process, which is used to predict the efficiency of the redistribution process."}
{"text":"\nWe present a quantum-orbit analysis of the high-harmonic generation (HHG) process in diatomic molecules. Our approach is based on the study of the electronic wave functions and the molecular orbitals that are involved in the process. We show that the main molecular orbital that is responsible for the emission of high harmonics is the one that is involved in the transition from the electronic ground state to the first excited state. We find that the molecular orbitals that are involved in the emission of high harmonics are very sensitive to the symmetry of the molecular system. In particular, we show that a change in the molecular symmetry may result in a dramatic change of the harmonics that are generated. As an example, we consider the case of HCl, which has a non-bonding lone pair that is responsible for the emission of high harmonics. We show that if we remove this lone pair, the spectrum is drastically changed, and high harmonics are no longer generated. In addition, we also analyze the effect of the symmetry of the electromagnetic field that is used to drive the transition. We find that a symmetric field is more efficient in driving the transition, but it also results in the emission of less harmonics."}
{"text":"\n\nThe polar ring galaxy AM1934-563 revisited\nWe present deep optical and near-infrared images of the polar ring galaxy AM1934-563 obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope. We show that the ring is dominated by the emission of the dust ring and contains only a few bright stars. We determine the radial and azimuthal extent of the dust ring and derive a simple model for the distribution of the dust within the ring. We find that the dust in the ring is distributed in a manner consistent with a Maxwellian distribution and that it is likely that the dust is composed of relatively large grains. We also present a catalog of about 150 stellar objects in the region. The catalog includes many stars that are in the disk of AM1934-563 and several objects that are probably satellites. We determine the orbits of the satellites and find that they are generally in orbits that are not highly eccentric. Finally, we compare the properties of the polar ring galaxy AM1934-563 with those of the polar ring galaxies AM2631-001 and AM2944-1896. We find that the properties of these galaxies are generally similar, except that AM2631-001 contains a bright inner ring of stars and a dust tail and that AM2944-1896 has a much more extended system of globular clusters than does AM1934-563."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a new selection algorithm for dualheaps. Our algorithm is efficient, inherently parallel and somewhat mysterious. The efficiency comes from the observation that the inner loop of the selection algorithm can be replaced with a one-sided rank-down heapify. The inherent parallelism arises from the fact that this one-sided heapify can be implemented by having each processor take over a portion of the input array and then merge the resulting subheaps. The mysteriousness comes from the fact that our selection algorithm, although selection-theoretic in flavor, does not have a good intuitive interpretation in terms of selections. We show, however, that our algorithm is closely related to a more intuitive algorithm for selecting the kth smallest element from a parallel array, which we call the k-way division selection algorithm. We give a simple proof of a strict inequality between the efficiency of our selection algorithm and that of the k-way division selection algorithm. We show that our selection algorithm can be used to implement an efficient parallel selection algorithm for a more general priority queue data structure. We also show that our selection algorithm is closely related to an efficient parallel merge algorithm for permutations."}
{"text":"\nThe competition of hydrogen-like and isotropic interactions on polymer collapse\n\nThe competition between hydrogen-like and isotropic interactions in macromolecular systems is an old and controversial problem. The objective of this work is to reexamine this problem in the framework of the Cray surfing model. We consider the effects of different macromolecular interactions on the equilibrium structure and the dynamical properties of the polymer chain. We show that the different interactions compete with each other in a different way for the collapsed and the extended states. Our main result is that the competition between the different interactions is effectively reduced to the competition between the hydrogen-like and the isotropic interactions, if the difference between these two interaction strengths is sufficiently large. The practical consequence of this result is that the collapse of the polymer chain is a truly competitive process, while the dynamics is mainly influenced by the strong hydrogen-like interactions, if the differences in the strengths of the various interactions is sufficiently large. We discuss the relevance of our results for experimental studies of the dynamics of biological macromolecules."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present far-infrared flux densities of galaxies in the local volume, as derived from Spitzer data. We find that the distribution of far-infrared emission is strongly correlated with the distribution of star formation, but that the two distributions only partially overlap. The far-infrared emission from galaxies is mostly from dust at intermediate redshifts (z < 1), while star formation is more evenly distributed over galaxies in the local volume. The excess of far-infrared emission over star formation is largest for galaxies in the local group, and decreases monotonically with galaxy redshift. We find that the observed correlation is consistent with a simple model in which the dust emission from a galaxy is due to a single burst of star formation, and the star formation rate is simply extrapolated to low redshift using the relation between star formation and redshift. We discuss the implications of our findings for the origin of dust in galaxies, and for the process of galaxy formation and evolution."}
{"text":"\n\nA Research-Based Curriculum for Teaching the Photoelectric Effect\n\nThe photoelectric effect is a key concept in the teaching of both physics and chemistry. However, many students have difficulty in understanding the underlying principles. In this paper, we present the results of an extensive study of students' conceptions of the photoelectric effect, and we use these results to develop a research-based curriculum for teaching this effect.\n\nOur study involved 78 students from China, France, Japan, and the United States. The results showed that the students' conceptions can be divided into three categories: (1) conceptions that are consistent with the scientific view; (2) conceptions that are partially consistent with the scientific view; and (3) conceptions that are inconsistent with the scientific view. Based on these results, we developed a curriculum that includes three parts: (1) a pre-activity that is used to activate the students' prior knowledge and to identify the students' conceptions; (2) a concept-formation activity that is used to help the students to revise their conceptions and to form a correct conception of the photoelectric effect; and (3) a post-activity that is used to evaluate the students' conceptions.\n\nThe results of an effectiveness study showed that the students' conceptions were significantly changed after the teaching activities. In addition, the students' ability to use the photoelectric effect to explain various phenomena was significantly enhanced. We also found that the effect of the curriculum was significantly better than that of the traditional curriculum.\n\nThe results of this study have important implications for teaching the photoelectric effect. First, it is necessary to understand students' conceptions of the photoelectric effect. Second, a research-based curriculum that is designed to help students revise their conceptions should be used to teach this effect."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a multiwavelength study of the dust environment of six young massive star forming regions, based on an analysis of the far-infrared to ultraviolet spectral energy distribution of these regions. We find that the far-infrared spectral energy distribution can be described by a simple model in which the dust temperature varies inversely with the distance to the nearest massive star. The shape of the model is consistent with a simple argument based on the competition between the heating and cooling of the dust by the star and the gas. The model can be used to derive the size of the regions. We also derive a simple expression for the mass of the molecular cloud in these regions, in terms of the mass of the stars. The derived masses are consistent with the idea that the mass of the molecular cloud is about two to three times the mass of the stars, in units of solar masses. We have compared the present results with the results of a previous study of three star forming regions, and found that the two sets of results are consistent with each other. We have also compared the present results with a model of the interstellar medium, and found that the two sets of results are consistent with each other. The results of the present study show that massive star forming regions are more compact than expected from a simple application of the theory of molecular clouds. We have discussed this result in the framework of the theories of molecular clouds and massive star forming regions."}
{"text":"\nWe have developed a theory of magnetic reconnection in high energy plasmas, based on the principle of least action. This theory is capable of describing a wide variety of magnetic reconnection phenomena, such as magnetic braking, stochastic diffusion, and explosion, as different limiting cases. The theory provides a good description of experimental data on magnetic reconnection in several types of laboratory plasmas, such as shocked ropes, spark discharge plasmas, and electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) plasmas. It also provides a good description of data on magnetic reconnection in space plasmas, such as the solar wind and the magnetospheric plasmas, in the form of the so-called super diffusion model. Our theory also makes it possible to determine the basic mechanisms of energy conversion in magnetic reconnection, and the efficiency of this process.

{"text":"\n\nWe present observations of two substellar companions in the open clusters NGC 2423 and NGC 4349.

We present new observations of these two targets, including high-resolution spectroscopy, that reveal the properties of these two companions in more detail. We find that both companions are likely to be extremely low-mass ( <= 7 Jupiter masses) and have low orbital eccentricities. We present a comparison of the observed properties of these two companions with predictions from atmospheric models for planets of different masses, and find that these two objects are best described as having rocky super Earth masses (3-7 Earth masses). We conclude that a large fraction of massive (10-100 solar masses) clusters such as these are likely to host several substellar companions, the majority of which are likely to be super Earths."}

{"text":"\nWe review the problem of cosmic acceleration and the alleged discovery of dark energy. We question the assumptions that have led to the dominant theories and point out that there are alternatives that can explain the observations without the introduction of a dark energy component. We also point out that the observed acceleration might be a natural consequence of the evolution of the universe and its topography, and that a continued expansion is not inconsistent with a universe dominated by matter and without a cosmological constant. We review the evidence that the large scale structure of the universe is a natural consequence of the behavior of galaxies and clusters, and we discuss the alternatives to the cold dark matter theory. We point out that a large scale structure with the right scale to explain the cosmic acceleration can be obtained without any exotic component. We discuss the role of the cosmological constant in the evolution of the universe, and the different forms that it can take. We show that the evolution of the universe can be fully explained without a cosmological constant and that the observed acceleration can be obtained by a combination of the expansion of the universe and the evolution of its scale structure. We discuss the implications of our scenario for the nature of the dark matter and the energy components of the universe, and for the fundamental physics."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider the problem of describing the structure of a liquid in terms of the structure of its components. We focus on the case of a liquid which consists of a lattice of one component, embedded in a second component which is charge-carrying. We show that in a certain range of concentrations of the charge-carrying component, the liquid can be well-described by a cartoon picture, where the sites of the lattice component are occupied by a single charge-carrying particle each, and the rest of the liquid is occupied by the second component in a disordered fashion. This picture is in agreement with the structural properties of the liquid, as obtained from a variety of different experimental methods. In particular, the dependence of the liquid structure on the concentration of the charge-carrying component is consistent with a picture where the charge-carrying particles are disorderedly packed in the space between the lattice sites, in a way which is dictated by the structure of the lattice. Our results suggest a possible general framework for describing liquids which contain strongly-correlated electrons."}
{"text":"\nWe present scaling relations between the multi-wavelength properties of galaxy clusters, based on a sample of 44 clusters in the redshift range 0.125 < z_ cluster < 1.02. We use the catalog of cluster galaxies extracted from the Two Micron All Sky Survey, and fit the linear relation between the X-ray and optical galaxy number densities, and the X-ray and radio galaxy number densities, respectively, as a function of cluster mass. We find that the relation for the X-ray and optical galaxy number densities is described by a power law with a linearly dependent index, and the relation for the X-ray and radio galaxy number densities is described by a power law with a quadratically dependent index. We show that the difference between these two scaling relations is explained by a simple model in which the radio galaxies are selected from a general population of galaxies on the basis of their X-ray emission, and the optical galaxies are selected from a general population of galaxies on the basis of their X-ray emission and their radio emission. The model predictions are in good agreement with the observed relations, thus providing a simple explanation for the different scaling relations for the number densities of galaxies selected on the basis of their X-ray emission. We discuss the implications of this analysis for future galaxy cluster surveys, in which galaxies are selected on the basis of their X-ray emission, and the resulting scaling relations for the number densities of these galaxies are used to study the relation between cluster mass and cluster environment."}

{"text":"\n\nWe study the problem of detecting an electric field along a line in the presence of a magnetic field which is perpendicular to the line and constant along the line. We show that in this case the detected electric field is a constant multiple of the incident field, and that this multiple is proportional to the ratio of the strengths of the two fields. We deduce a method for measuring the two fields simultaneously which does not depend on any scalar parameter, and hence is applicable in any inertial frame. This method can be used to measure the ratio of the strengths of the two fields, provided that the strengths of the two fields are different at the two ends of the line. We show that if the two fields are not orthogonal at every point along the line, then the detected field is not proportional to the ratio of the strengths of the two fields. We deduce a geometric construction which shows that the orthogonal condition is equivalent to the statement that the two fields are equal at every point along the line. This deduction is made by means of a suitable choice of coordinate system. We also show that if the two fields are not equal at every point along the line, then there is a point along the line at which the detected field is equal to zero."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present here results of a systematic study of the cycle of interstellar dust in galaxies of different morphological types. We found that the abundance of interstellar dust is almost constant, independently of the galaxy morphological type. The total dust mass is, on average, about 2% of the stellar mass. The dust-to-stellar mass ratio is in good agreement with the predictions of the hypothesis of a steady-state model of dust evolution in galaxies. We found a direct correlation between the galaxy luminosity and the mass of dust in its interstellar medium, both in local and in distant galaxies. This correlation is in agreement with the prediction of the dust evolution model, according to which the dust-to-stellar mass ratio is proportional to the inverse of the galaxy luminosity. The analysis of the data on the stellar mass, the luminosity, and the dust mass in galaxies shows that the main phase of dust evolution, with the highest rate of dust condensation, takes place at the galaxies' ages between 1 and 10 billion years. We found that in the galaxies with the age less than 1 billion years the interstellar medium is very poor in dust, which is in good agreement with the prediction of the dust evolution model that the initial phase of dust evolution is very slow. The analysis of the data on the stellar mass, the luminosity, and the dust mass in galaxies shows that the galaxies' ability to convert the stellar mass into dust is almost constant, independently of the galaxy's age. We found that the dust evolution in galaxies is controlled by the stellar mass and the luminosity, and the rate of dust evolution is almost constant, independently of the galaxy's morphological type. We discuss these results in the framework of the hypothesis of a steady-state model of dust evolution in galaxies."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate the relationship between curvature, deformations and contrations on a Riemannian manifold. We show that the entropically motivated deformations of the metric, which have been proposed in the literature as a way of constructing finite volume metrics on Riemannian manifolds, have a simple description in terms of a large class of curvature functions which have a particular form in the covarient derivatives. In particular, we show that the affine curvature and the 1-form curvature are such curvature functions. As a by-product of this description we obtain a geometrically simple formula for the Compression function and we show that this agrees with the one obtained via the heat flow equations in the literature. We then use this description to obtain a simple formula for the volume of a contraction on a Riemannian manifold which is motivated by the idea of a deformation volume. We show that this has an intuitive geometric meaning which is related to the idea of a volume being the amount of space that an object occupies. We apply this to the setting ofsymplectic geometry, where one can think of a symplectic form as an object which occupies space in a Riemannian manifold, and use this to obtain a geometrically simple formula for the variety of a contact structure on a Riemannian manifold in terms of the associated curvature function. We also show that this variety has a natural description in terms of the Dirac operator on the symplectic form, which relates it to the geometric setting of Dirac operators on Riemannian manifolds."}

{"text":"\n\nWe present a dynamical analysis of the Norma Cluster (ACO 3627), the most massive cluster in the Great Attractor. A large fraction of the cluster's total mass is contributed by a group of giant molecular clouds (GMCs) which are responsible for the high metallicity of the cluster. We show that the kinematics of these clouds are consistent with a massive infall from the systemic cirrus clouds of the Orion arm. We have identified a total of eight satellite clouds around the main cluster, four of which are associated with the GMCs. We show that the relative velocity of the clouds is in agreement with the cluster's radial velocity of +5 km s$^{-1}$. We have used the ages of the stars in the cluster to determine the cluster's formation history. We show that the age distribution of the cluster is consistent with a model in which the gas infall happened before the massive starburst in the central region, and we discuss the relation of this event with the origin of the short-lived radio sources in the cluster."}
{"text":"\nWe propose and analyze a new type of defect modes in periodically structured photonic lattices, which are formed by introducing two-dimensional (2D) defects in the original lattice. The 2D defects are created by removing one row or one column from the lattice, which results in a lattice with 2D symmetry. The defect modes are formed by the linear coupling between the defects and the normal modes of the 2D lattice. The allowed defect modes have very rich and interesting structures, and can be found by solving the 2D discrete Biot-Savart equation. We analyze the defect modes from the perspective of symmetry and local symmetry. The results show that the defect modes can have either 2D or 3D symmetry, and can be further classified into several classes according to the local symmetry. We also derive the relationship between the 2D defect modes and the conventional 1D defect modes, and find that the 2D defect modes can be regarded as the superposition of several 1D defect modes with different phases. Our work provides a new way to construct interesting photonic devices with 2D symmetry."}
{"text":"\nWe present a wide deep infrared survey of the Pleiades cluster with UKIDSS, which provides new constraints on the substellar binary fraction and the low mass initial mass function (IMF). We use a combination of sensitive wide-field imaging and high-resolution spectroscopy to detect infrared excesses from 37 stars in the cluster, of which 19 are new discoveries. Follow-up spectroscopy of these objects demonstrates that 21 are low-mass stars with temperatures in the range 1500-4000 K, and hence are likely to be members of the cluster. We conclude that the proportion of substellar objects in the cluster is at most 15%, significantly less than previous estimates. The properties of the IMF can be derived directly from the observed properties of the low-mass stars in the cluster. We show that a lower mass limit of 0.6 MJup (0.2 M\u2299) can be excluded for all stars in the cluster, assuming that the high-mass end of the IMF is flat. A lower mass limit of 0.45 MJup (0.16 M\u2299) is derived if the high-mass end of the IMF is extrapolated from the Sun's birth mass. The lower limit on the IMF derived in this work is consistent with a recent analysis of the low-mass end of the IMF in globular clusters. We discuss this analysis in the context of recent work on the formation of the solar system and the search for extra-solar planets."}
{"text":"\nWe study a dynamics-controlled truncation scheme for nonlinear dynamics in semiconductor microcavities. We consider a system of two microcavities which are coupled through a common linear amplifier. We use a special kind of a highly resonant microcavity, which in contrast to usual linear cavities, does not possess a well-defined steady state. The system is driven by a pulsed laser and the coupling between the two cavities is controlled by a dynamically adjustable optical fiber tap. By changing the coupling strength in time, we can drive the system from a regular to a chaotic regime and vice versa. We observe four different types of damped oscillations, where the damping time depends on the initial conditions. We find that the dynamics of the system can be controlled by changing the coupling strength in a certain way. Our scheme allows one to drive the system from any initial condition to a specific final state by means of a sequence of appropriately chosen impulses. We show that such a control scheme can be realized with a high degree of precision by using suitable pulse shaping and that it is robust against realistic variations of the parameters of the system."}
{"text":"\nWe present a distributed implementation of standard oracle operators. The implementation is based on a divide-and-conquer strategy and can be used in a variety of settings, including distributed databases and distributed constraint reasoning. The main idea is to divide the input data into smaller chunks and to process each chunk independently. The results of the processing are then combined to obtain the final result. The division of the input data can be done in a number of ways, depending on the specific requirements of the application. For example, if the input data is very large, it can be divided into smaller chunks based on a predetermined size. If the input data is very complex, it can be divided into smaller chunks based on a predetermined level of complexity. The processing of each chunk can also be done in a number of ways, depending on the specific requirements of the application. For example, if the processing of each chunk is very simple, it can be done in a single step. If the processing of each chunk is more complex, it can be done in a series of steps. The results of the processing can then be combined in a number of ways, depending on the specific requirements of the application. For example, if the results of the processing are very simple, they can be combined in a single step. If the results of the processing are more complex, they can be combined in a series of steps. The overall performance of the distributed implementation depends on a number of factors, including the specific requirements of the application, the size of the input data, the complexity of the processing, and the number of steps in the combination of the results. We discuss the performance of the distributed implementation in a number of settings, including distributed databases and distributed constraint reasoning."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present high-resolution FUSE and HST ultraviolet spectroscopy of the central star of Sh 2-216, a prominent planetary nebula. We find a strong N III luminosity peak in the FUSE data, indicating the presence of a massive hot spot on the white dwarf's atmosphere. We estimate the white dwarf's temperature to be around 12,000 K, which is consistent with previous optical spectroscopy. We derive an estimate for the white dwarf's radius of  R = 1.7 R . Our data also yield a measurement of the orbital period, P = 5.82 \u00b1 0.08 min. We find that the FUSE and HST data are consistent with a white dwarf with a cool atmosphere (log Te = 7.5), unless the hot spot temperature is much higher than the bulk atmosphere. The hot spot, if composed of material at a temperature of 12,000 K, would have a lifetime of  \u223c 105 years. Alternatively, if the hot spot is at a higher temperature, its lifetime would be shorter. We discuss several models to explain the hot spot, including magnetic induction and the impact of planetesimals."}
{"text":"\nWe report on the growth mechanisms and structure of fullerene-like carbon-based thin films: superelastic materials for tribological applications. The motivation for the research is the demand for novel materials with unique properties for tribological applications. The key ideas and methodology are the use of the detonation process as a method for the synthesis of fullerene-like carbons, and the implementation of in situ diagnostics by using a quartz microbalance that allows us to monitor the growth process. The results obtained are the description of the growth mechanisms and the determination of the structural and tribological properties of the films. The problem the work attempts to solve is to find a method for the synthesis of fullerene-like carbon films with tailored properties for tribological applications. Any practical or theoretical applications from the findings or implications for future research include the potential use of fullerene-like carbon films as novel materials with unique properties for tribological applications, and the potential use of the detonation process as a method for the synthesis of nanocarbon materials with tailored properties."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate the dynamics of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) in a one-dimensional optical lattice, which is first prepared in a thermal equilibrium state and then rapidly displaced out of equilibrium by a short laser pulse. We find that the dynamics of the BEC during the evolution towards the new equilibrium state can be described by a general theoretical formalism based on the concept of non-equilibrium coherence. Our theory provides a good description of the experimentally observed dynamics in a recent experiment by Lucas et al., in which a one-dimensional BEC in a shallow optical lattice was driven out of equilibrium by a laser pulse. We also make predictions for the dynamics of a BEC in a deep optical lattice, which has not been investigated experimentally so far. Our results are relevant for a better understanding of the dynamics of quasiparticles in non-equilibrium states and for the development of practical schemes for the realization of matter-wave solitons in optical lattices."}

{"text":"\n\nStep density waves (SDWs) are an exotic but robust form of long-range order that can appear on the surface of crystalline materials, in particular on the vicinal surface of silicon. They are formed by a periodically modulated arrangement of terrace-dwelling steps, which give rise to a periodically oscillating surface free energy. We have developed a model which is able to describe the formation of SDWs on vicinal silicon surfaces, based on a minimalist description of the surface, which treats the step edge as a nematic liquid crystal. In particular, we focus on the interplay between the internal degrees of freedom of the step edge and the elastic response of the surface to a lateral stress, which we demonstrate to be sufficient to form a stable SDW state. Within this model, we are able to derive a simple expression for the pitch of the SDW, which is in good agreement with experimental observations. We also discuss a number of geometric effects which can lead to a violation of the periodicity of the SDW, and to the formation of a faceted surface."}
{"text":"\nWe propose a framework for consistent reasoning about a continuum of hypotheses on the basis of finite evidence, which we call discriminatory sketch-based reasoning (DSBR). Given a collection of sketches representing pieces of evidence, DSBR maps the sketches into a latent space of hypotheses and uses a discrimination function to score the hypotheses. We show that DSBR is well-defined provided that the discrimination function is monotonically related to a continuous function of the sketch representations. We then develop a general framework forDSBR, and show how it can be applied to several concrete tasks, such as discriminating between handwritten digits, faces, and gestures. We also show how to optimize the performance of DSBR using a branch-and-bound method. Finally, we present an experimental evaluation of DSBR on the tasks mentioned above, as well as a new task of distinguishing between yoga and Pilates poses, and demonstrate that DSBR achieves state-of-the-art performance on all tasks while being computationally efficient."}
{"text":"\nWe present a detailed study of the three dimensional structure of the intergalactic medium in the nearby galaxy NGC 891. The analysis is based on a new high-resolution near-infrared extinction map of the galaxy, which is combined with a re-examination of published far-infrared and submillimeter data. The new map reveals a sharp rise in the extinction coefficient of the intergalactic medium to the north of the plane of the galaxy, reaching a factor of 2 above the mean value in the region 8 kpc above the plane. We show this to be a signature of a large-scale three-dimensional structure, possibly a bubble, in the intergalactic medium. The origin of this structure is not understood. It could be a chance structure, or it could be related to the flow of the intergalactic medium in the neighbourhood of the galactic centre. The existence of this structure has implications for numerical simulations of galaxy formation. Most numerical simulations of structure formation do not include the effects of an ordered magnetic field in the intergalactic medium, despite the fact that the observed structure is very similar to the large-scale magnetic field structures observed in the solar wind. We discuss this in the context of a simple model in which the large-scale structure is due to a large-scale helical magnetic field, trapped in the ISM."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present photometric and spectroscopic observations of the eclipsing binary V471 Tau. The white dwarf primary has a relatively long orbital period of 446.6 \u00b1 0.4 min, which results in a large number of eclipse cycles observable over a short timescale. We have analysed a set of 37 eruption events observed during 2000-2003, and found that the accretion events occur in eclipse, with a delay of typically 200-1000 seconds after inferior conjunction. We find that the accretion rate is variable, with a magnitude range of 6.4 mag, and a power law distribution with an index of -1.2 \u00b1 0.1. We find no evidence for a larger eruption size for the first eruption in an eclipse sequence. We have observed four main types of eruption, with masses of 1.6-2.0 M\u2299, and a total mass-loss rate of  \u223c 6.7 \u00d7 10-14 M\u2299 yr-1. The observed properties of the accretion disc are consistent with the disc being composed of four zones: a hot inner zone, with a temperature of  \u223c 80000 K, a transition zone, with a temperature of  \u223c 40000 K, an accretion zone, with a temperature of  \u223c 15000 K, and an outer zone, with a temperature of  \u223c 10000 K. We find that the accretion disc is geometrically thick, with a thickness of  \u223c 2.5 RJD, where RJD is the Roche lobe. We have determined the white dwarf's mass to be  \u223c 1.0Pursuant to our findings, we conclude that V471 Tau is a member of a new class of binary systems, in which the accretion disc is stable over many orbital periods. We estimate that there are  \u223c 100 systems of this type in the Galaxy."}
{"text":"\n\nWe investigate the impact of longitudinal impedance and wake from X-ray Free-Electron Lasers (XFELs) on current-enhanced schemes for SASE amplification. We consider the particular case of the FERMI@Elettra XFEL, which is an XFEL with a passive resonant cavity that provides a high-repetition-rate ultra-short pulse source in the energy range above 10 keV. We model the XFEL as a voltage-controlled current source in series with a variable resistance and a capacitor. The model allows us to evaluate the impedance of the XFEL as a function of the X-ray energy and the repetition rate. We find that the resulting impedance can be described by a sum of a low-frequency (RF) resistance and a high-frequency (zero-order) resistance. We then use a simple model to evaluate the wake in the X-ray energy range above 10 keV. We consider the particular case of a XFEL wake containing a single spot in the cross-sectional plane and a Gaussian distribution in the longitudinal direction. We find that, for XFELs with a high-repetition-rate (above 1 Hz) and high-energy (above 10 keV), the wake can be approximated by a short-circuit in the cross-sectional plane. We finally evaluate the impact of the XFEL impedance and wake on the current-enhanced scheme. We find that the XFEL wake creates a condition for a stable self-sustained electron discharge. We discuss the practical implications of our findings and their consequences for future research."}

{"text":"\n\nWe present the results of a narrow band H-alpha imaging survey of 52 galaxies in the local volume selected for their isolation and lack of any detected dust emission. We find a total of 78 diffuse H-alpha emitting regions in the disks of 36 galaxies, in association with star forming regions in 26 galaxies and as isolated objects in ten galaxies. The median number of H-alpha regions in the disk of a galaxy is one, with the exception of the Antennae galaxies where we find eight regions. The total H-alpha luminosity of the disk in the Antennae galaxies is 2.4 times the luminosity of the entire rest of the local volume. The H-alpha regions are located within 1.5R\u2097\u2092 from the core, where R\u2097\u2092 is the radius of the disk and the core is defined by the peak of the spatial distribution of the atomic hydrogen. The H-alpha luminosity distribution in the disks is well described by a broken power law with a sharp cut-off at the boundary of the disk, with a shape that depends only on the scale of the disk. The break-points of the power laws are at 0.3R\u2097\u2092 and 0.6R\u2097\u2092, with an index of \u22120.4 \u00b1 0.1 and \u22120.1 \u00b1 0.1 for the inner and outer regions, respectively. We conclude that the diffuse H-alpha regions in the disks of galaxies are well described by a broken power law distribution, with the break-points of the power law defined by the boundary of the disk. The total H-alpha luminosity of the disk is found to be proportional to the stellar mass M\u22c5_(\u2299) of the galaxy, with a correlation coefficient of 0.9. We also find that the H-alpha luminosity in the disk is inversely proportional to the radius R\u2097\u2092 of the disk, with a correlation coefficient of \u22120.5. We discuss these results in the context of the global star formation history of the Universe and the theory of disk evolution."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present photometric detections of the substellar twin 2MASS J11011926-7732383 AB at optical and near-infrared wavelengths using the NASA\/ESA Hubble Space Telescope and the VLT\/FORS. We find that the photospheres of the stars are not obscured by the disk, in contradiction to previous claims. We also find that the disk is slightly eccentric and inclined to the line joining the two stars, in agreement with the predictions of analytical models. We show that the disk's properties are consistent with a model in which the disk forms via the accretion of planetesimals. The measured disk properties are consistent with a relatively rapid (by solar system standards) migration of the giant planets, a scenario that is supported by dynamical models. The derived mass of the disk is consistent with a mass formed by the accretion of planetesimals but is inconsistent with the mass required to form giant planets by the accretion of planetesimals. We discuss various scenarios that could explain this discrepancy."}
{"text":"\n\nWe investigate the role of carrier-carrier entanglement and transport resonances in the transport properties of semiconductor quantum dots. We consider a spherical quantum dot attached to the leads, which are attached to the substrates, and a finite-sized quantum dot in a similar configuration, which are placed in a disorder bath. We found that both quantum dots can be in an entanglement-induced negative-temperature state below a certain critical temperature, and the state is very stable against temperature variations. We also found the finite-sized quantum dot to be in a state with very long coherence time, and the dynamics in this state is completely different from the coherent state with low entanglement. We show that these results can be explained by a simple model, in which a certain number of carriers are 'trapped' at the dot-lead interface and their spatial distribution is influenced by entanglement and transport resonances. We also derived a simple formula for the entanglement-induced negative-temperature state. Our results provide a route to engineer non-trivial states in quantum dot systems by using carrier-carrier entanglement and transport resonances."}
{"text":"\n\nWe consider the boundary value problems for elliptic partial differential equations which are invariant under conformal transformations. Such problems are motivated by the desire to construct equations which have solutions with specified boundary conditions on a Riemannian manifold, in a fashion analogous to the Dirichlet problem for the Laplace equation. Two such problems are given by the generalized Christoffel equation and the generalized Nirenberg equation. We show that the solutions of these problems are hypersurfaces in H^{n+1}, with the boundary conditions imposed via a constraint on the normal bundle. We then describe the geometry of these hypersurfaces, and give a necessary and sufficient condition for the boundary conditions to be compatible with the solution hypersurface. We also show that the generalized Nirenberg equation has a solution on any Riemannian manifold which is a Legendre transform of the solution of a Dirichlet problem for a certain elliptic partial differential equation on the interior of the manifold."}
{"text":"\n\nWe have performed a three-dimensional (3D) analysis of the di-pion transitions among the upsilon(3S), upsilon(2S), and upsilon(1S) states. The calculation is based on the 3D Lanczos method for the gauge-field-pulse-evaporation (GFE) theory. We found the relative contributions of the two-pion and three-pion channels to the transition rates to be very different for the three pairs of upsilon states. We also found the interference terms between the two-pion and three-pion channels to be very small for the upsilon(3S) and upsilon(2S) states but large for the upsilon(1S) states. This result is consistent with the large rate of the three-pion channel for the transitions from the upsilon(1S) states to the upsilon(3S) states.\n\nThe motivation for this work is to study the structure of the upsilon(3S) and upsilon(2S) states in the framework of the GFE theory. The GFE theory is a microscopic theory for the strong interaction in the framework of the evolution theory. The states with the upsilon(3S) and upsilon(2S) symmetries are excited states with the quark- antiquark-antiquark configuration. These states have a very small lifetime against the strong interaction, and the transitions to the lower states with the upsilon(1S) symmetry are very fast. Therefore, the large rate of the transitions from the upsilon(1S) states to the upsilon(3S) states may be understood in the framework of the GFE theory as a consequence of the strong repulsion between the antiquarks in the upsilon(3S) and upsilon(2S) states. We also discuss the possibility of a GFE interpretation for the structure of the upsilon(3S) and upsilon(2S) states in the framework of the GFE theory."}
{"text":"\n\nWe study the geometry of a class of regular shear-free null geodesic congruences in general spacetimes. We show that this class has a natural description in terms of CR functions. We use this description to study the asymptotic behavior of the number of branches of regular shear-free null geodesic congruences as the spacetime dimension increases. This allows us to prove the conjecture of Detweiler and Teitler that the only regular shear-free null geodesic congruence in spaces of dimension three and higher is the empty set. We also prove that any regular shear-free null geodesic congruence of rank two in spaces of dimension five and higher has at most two branches. As an application of our geometric description of regular shear-free null geodesic congruences, we give a description of the set of all regular null geodesics in terms of CR functions. This description allows us to prove the disqualified conjecture of Dunkl that the only regular null geodesic in spaces of dimension three and higher is the empty set. We show that the only regular null geodesic in spaces of dimension five and higher is the set of all half-spheres. As another application of our geometric description of regular shear-free null geodesic congruences, we study the properties of solutions of the flat-space Maxwell equations which are in general position with respect to a regular shear-free null geodesic congruence.

{"text":"\nWe show that a general and rigidly fixed Quark-Lepton number generation mechanism in the strong interactions, with a non-trivial structure of the Quark-Lepton multiplets in the fundamental representation of the relevant symmetry group, is possible if the Quark-Lepton number is generated non-dynamically, i.e. independently on the quantum state of the system. The structure of the Quark-Lepton number generation mechanism in the strong interactions is governed by the geometry of the relevant symmetry group. Therefore the possibility of a non-trivial Quark-Lepton number generation mechanism in the strong interactions depends on the existence of a non-trivial geometry of the relevant symmetry group. We show that such a non-trivial geometry exists in the case of a certain family of spontaneously broken symmetries with a three-fold rotation axis, which includes the SU(2) symmetry group of the strong interactions.

The extra-tidal population has a mean orbital radius of 17.5(?)+1.9R_0, where R_0 is the orbital radius of the cluster. The extra-tidal stars have a higher velocity dispersion than the cluster's tidal stars, and they show a clear excess at the blue end of the color-magnitude diagram. The orbital elements and photometry of these stars are consistent with an origin in a satellite globular cluster that was accreted by M31's globular cluster system. The extra-tidal stars have a high proper motion, indicating that they are moving out of the M31 system. We estimate that the extra-tidal cluster has a mass of  \u223c 2x105M\u2299, corresponding to  \u223c 1% of the primary cluster's mass. We have searched for a possible relationship between the extra-tidal cluster and the large blue star-forming region in the M31 disk, but the extra-tidal stars are not part of any known star-forming complex.

{"text":"\nWe study the statistical properties of local morphological measures computed on the WMAP full-sky map. In particular, we consider the statistics of the \" hearth \" defined as the pixels that are surrounded by a high-explanatory-value region. We show that the distribution of the number of pixels in each \" hearth \" has heavy tails and is not Gaussian. This non-Gaussianity is due to the fact that the large scale structure in the Universe is not completely described by the power law, but has a lot of small-scale fluctuations. We show that this non-Gaussianity is in fact a general feature of the distribution of the number of pixels in a region with a given morphological measure. We find that this non-Gaussianity is in fact scale-free. We show that the same type of non-Gaussianity can be obtained by a simple model in which the large scale structure is described by a power law with a cut-off, while the small-scale fluctuations are generated by a Gaussian random field. We show that the distribution of the number of pixels in a region with a given morphological measure has a few remarkable features: (i) it has heavy tails, (ii) it is scale-free, and (iii) it can be well described by a simple model."}
{"text":"\nWe present a comparison of the X-ray-derived and weak-lensing-derived masses for a large sample of 50 galaxy clusters selected from the Southern Cluster Survey with high Jacoisci values, which are indicative of strong lensing by the clusters. The clusters are selected to have well-observed X-ray and weak-lensing data available. We find that the X-ray-derived masses are, on average, 1.5 times larger than the weak-lensing-derived masses. We show this ratio is consistent with a constant conversion factor for converting between the two mass estimates, with the exception of clusters in the most distant half of the sample, for which the conversion factor is significantly larger. We discuss various physical mechanisms that may be responsible for the discrepancy between the X-ray-derived and weak-lensing-derived masses, and conclude that the most likely explanation is that the X-ray-derived masses are contaminated by gas in the intercluster medium. We show that the proportion of gas in the X-ray-derived masses for the clusters in our sample is, on average, 18%, with a significant tail toward higher values (up to 50%). We discuss the implications of our results for cluster scaling relations and the application of the weak-lensing method to the study of clusters."}

The key idea is to use the ECC method which has already been successfully used to describe the quarkonia production in hadron collisions. The main challenge is to tune the ECC parameter to describe the charm quark fragmentation in a broad energy region, in which the charmonia production is also described. We show that this can be achieved by using two different sets of the ECC parameters, which are tuned to describe the charm quark fragmentation and the charmonia production respectively in the low energy region and in the high energy region. The problem the work attempts to solve is to provide a framework which is able to describe the charm quark fragmentation in a broad energy region, in which the charmonia production is also described. The practical application of the work is to provide a description for the charm quark fragmentation which is free from any extra parameters. The theoretical application of the work is to study the structure of the charm quark and antiquark in the quark-antiquark collision."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate the formation of black holes in very massive stars in full general relativity. We consider a model in which the stellar mass is distributed homogeneously, and the star is rotating and axially symmetric. We find that for stars with a mass $M\\sim10^{32}$ kg, the gravitational instability against an axisymmetric perturbation (which we consider in a first approximation as adelta-pinch) is not stable against a rotation frequency $\\Omega_{\\rm crit} \\sim 2.2 \\cdot 10^{29}$ Hz. Thus, for these stars the magnetorotational instability will not be the relevant mechanism for the formation of black holes, but other mechanisms such as the direct collapse of the star to a black hole or the formation of a accretion disc around the collapsed object, that can be eventually accreted by a black hole. In addition, we find that the evolutionary track of the stellar collapse is very sensitive to the value of the adiabatic index $\\gamma$ of the gas, which must be known with a good accuracy. In particular, we find that the tidal gravity waves generated during the collapse can produce a significant increase of the gravitational radius of the object, in spite of the fact that the total mass is decreasing."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present multiwavelength photometry and spectroscopy of the superbubble around the young stellar cluster NGC1705-1, which is a potential Birth-site of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). We find a clear signature of a soft X-ray transient, which is likely to be the accretion phase of a young stellar object, in the same location as the low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) in our previous study. The transient is invisible in the optical image, but its presence is inferred from the very high probability that the X-ray transient and the LMXB are physically associated. We also identify an arch-like feature in the radio image, which might be the counterpart of the X-ray transient in the radio band. The multiwavelength data are consistent with the interpretation that the X-ray transient is a young stellar object in the process of accretion. We discuss a simple model in which the radio arch is the result of the interaction of the accretion flow with the surrounding medium. We also re-investigate the possibility of a connection between the LMXB and the superbubble. The distribution of radio sources in the superbubble is consistent with the bubble being the result of the gas infall from the surrounding medium to the LMXB. We estimate the accretion rate of the LMXB to be  \u223c 1 \u2212 10^( \u2212 5) M_(\u2299) yr^( \u2212 1), which is  \u223c 10^( \u2212 5) \u2212 10^( \u2212 3) of the rate derived from the observations of long-duration gamma-ray bursts. We discuss the implications of this finding for the birth-site scenario."}
{"text":"\nWe are interested in the topological features of complex networks that are correlated with their functional properties. We focus on two features that have been found to be highly correlated with the efficiency of information propagation in complex networks: the strength and the distribution of chain motifs, which are subgraphs in which two or more nodes are linked in a sequence without other edges crossing them. We find that the distribution of chain motifs can be described by a simple model in which chains are formed by first adding a random number of edges between a pair of nodes and then repeating this process for all pairs of nodes until a network is formed. The number of edges in the resulting network is found to be close to a power law distributed around the number of nodes. We find that this simple model is able to capture many of the properties of real complex networks. In particular, we show that the fraction of time that a node is connected to a chain is proportional to the node's out-degree, and that the fraction of time that a chain is connected to other chains is proportional to the chain's length. These results suggest that the formation of chain motifs is an important step in the evolution of complex networks."}
{"text":"\n\nWe theoretically study the structural and electronic properties of ferroelectric potassium nitrate, in order to investigate the effects of the cation and anion on the polarizability of the crystal. We first perform a structural optimization, which consists in finding the set of distances between all the atoms that minimize the total energy of the system. In particular, we consider the effect of the anisotropic correlation functions in theBorn-Markov approximation. The results show that the anisotropic correlation functions have a strong effect on the polarizability of the crystal, being the second harmonic generation more efficient along the c-axis than along the a-axis. We also calculate the dielectric function in the frequency domain, which shows a clear peak at the so-called \"friendly\" frequency, being the dipole moment of the crystal along the a-axis. We also investigate the effect of a tensile strain along the a-axis on the electronic properties of the crystal, by means of a Hamiltonian that includes the strain term. We find that, by increasing the strain, the energy gap increases, being the effect more pronounced for the a-axis than for the c-axis. Our results are in good agreement with the available experimental data."}
{"text":"\n\nLine and Mean Opacities for Ultracool Dwarfs and Extrasolar Planets\n\nWe present line and mean opacities for twenty-two ultrashort-period planets and cool dwarfs. These are the first opacities for many of these objects and are crucial for determining atmospheric properties. We present new reduced-molecular-weight opacities for several molecular species in the infrared and new opacities for the visible region based on an improved molecular-hydrogen-equivalent method. We derive an expression for the visible opacity for a pure hydrogen atmosphere that includes the contribution from the Rayleigh scattering. We apply these new opacities to derive the effective temperature and surface gravity for each object. We find that nine of the objects have effective temperatures in the range between 1200 and 1800 K, which is similar to the temperature range found for the solar chromosphere. Three of the objects have effective temperatures below 1000 K. The derived surface gravity ranges from log(g) = 7.06 to 7.58, with a median value of 7.25. We compare the derived properties to those expected from a model atmosphere, and we find that they are consistent with an atmosphere that is fractionally hydrogen, with a solar metallicity, and with a temperature structure that is isothermal with a mean temperature between 1000 and 1300 K."}
{"text":"\nWe show that LHC and ILC can be connected via a Quintessence scenario in which the messenger field has a complex structure. The model is an extension of the one recently proposed by Degrassi et al. (arXiv:1302.7166). We find that such a model can be made to work in a realistic way, provided that the messenger field is a complex scalar field with a very small (of the order of the Planck scale) non-zero vacuum expectation value, and provided that the messenger field is not introduced as a \"new\" field, but rather as a \"change\" in the dynamics of an already existing (symmetric) scalar field. We show that in this case the dynamics of the symmetric scalar field can be made to display the same features of the standard Quintessence scenario, with a small modification in the parameters. We analyze the model in some detail and find that the new Quintessence scenario has all the features of the standard one, including the ability to give a dynamical explanation to the acceleration of the Universe, the ability to produce a scalar field which has the correct value at the correct time (the so-called \" scalar curate\" problem), and the ability to consistently generate a spectrum of cosmic rays which is in agreement with observations. We also find that the model is consistent with the cosmological constant being exactly zero."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a physical orbit for the pre-main sequence star V773 Tau A. The orbit is based on a least-squares fit to astrometric data from the Hipparchus and Tycho catalogs, Proper Motion data from the RAAMS database, and photometry from the Hipparchus and 2MASS catalogs. We find a best-fit orbit with a dynamical mass for V773 Tau A of 1.175  M circled by two giant planets, a Uranus-mass and a Saturn-mass, in a 4.5  day and a 19.39  day orbit, respectively. The semimajor axis of the orbit is 1.02  AU, with an orbital eccentricity of 0.67  and a maximum orbital inclination of 125  deg. We find that V773 Tau A has a minimum mass of 1.52  M  and a maximum mass of 2.67  M . We discuss this range of masses in the context of known planetary systems. We also find that the masses of the giant planets are consistent with the planetary system having formed through a smooth gravitational collapse of a gas cloud, with no need for a violent collapse, such as a core-collapse supernova, to form the heavier elements."}

{"text":"\nWe find a characteristic observable signature of preferred frame effects in relativistic binary pulsars. We consider the simplest case of a binary system in which the two objects have the same rest mass, and the only relevant gravitational interaction is between the two objects. In this case, the preferred frame is a frame in which both objects are at rest, and the observed effects are exactly those predicted by the equivalence principle. We find that this signature is characterized by three quantities: (1) the relative motion of the objects as observed in the rest frame of the system, (2) the time variation of this relative motion, and (3) the difference in the observed frequencies of the two objects. If the observed system is a relativistic binary pulsar, we find that these three quantities have specific expected values which are characteristic of the preferred frame effects, and are different from the values which would be obtained if the objects were observed in a non-relativistic reference frame."}
{"text":"\nAllovalency is a powerful tool used to investigate the recognition properties of substrates and inhibitors. We have developed a general approach, AlloMap, which uses the collection of all possible inorganic derivatives of a given ligand as a fingerprint for searching against the entire protein universe. AlloMap has been successfully applied to numerous cases where the native substrate or inhibitor is a protein, and the investigation of these systems has revealed new themes in allosteric regulation and substrate recognition. Here, we revisit the allovalent world and expand the utility of AlloMap by investigating the allosteric mechanism of two enzymes, one of which is a kinase. Our results reveal that the mechanism of allosteric regulation is tightly linked to the ability of the ligand to form multiple bonds with the protein, a phenomenon that we term multisite allovalency. We show that the degree to which a ligand can exhibit multisite allovalency is correlated with the dynamics of the protein, the nature of the allosteric mechanism, and the ability of the ligand to compete with the native substrate. We also show that a multisite allosteric inhibitor can function as a competitive inhibitor by forming a noncovalent complex with the enzyme, whereas a monovalent allosteric inhibitor requires the formation of a covalent adduct to achieve inhibition. Finally, we use our method to investigate the binding of inorganic pyrophosphate to a protein phosphatase, and our results reveal that this process is allosteric and involves multiple phosphate binding sites. Our work provides a general framework for the investigation of allosteric mechanisms and offers a new avenue for the design of allosteric effectors and inhibitors."}
{"text":"\nWe show that any iterated endomorphism on a polynomial algebra over a field has a common general form: it is either an iterated map to an algebra over a field or it is a combination of such iterated maps with an iterated map to the field itself. As an application, we give a description of the iterated endomorphisms of the polynomial algebra over a field in terms of the polynomial algebra's non-zero pivot elements."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present observations of the scattering polarization of the Sr I 4607 \u00c5 line towards the planet Mars, made with the 1-m telescope at La Silla Observatory. The observations were made in the Diffraction Limited Mode, i.e. with thepolarimeter placed at the aperture stop of the telescope, at a spectral resolution of $\\sim 4\\times 10^3$, close to the diffraction limit. We find that the degree of linear polarization of the scattered light increases with the viewing angle, in a way that is consistent with the radiative transfer model based on the laws of geometric optics. We derive an expression for the anisotropy of the polarization in terms of the thermodynamic properties of the atmosphere and the optical properties of the soil. The obtained value of the anisotropy, $\\sim 4\\%$, is consistent with the one found from the study of the statistical distribution of the polarization, $\\langle P_V\\rangle\/\\langle P_H\\rangle \\sim 3.5\\%$. The difference between the two values is due to the fact that the soil has a non-isotropic structure on the micro-scale, as revealed by the measurements made at low altitude. We find that the anisotropy of the scattering polarization is, on average, $\\sim 4\\%$, independent of the distance to the surface. We also find that the radiative transfer model based on the laws of geometric optics, which has been extensively used in the past to study light scattering from random media, is in good agreement with the observations, thus providing a simple and reliable tool to interpret polarization observations of planetary atmospheres."}
{"text":"\nWe re-examine the energy gap $\\Delta$ of the cut-off approximation in the theory of superconductivity in cuprates, and point out that an overlooked translation symmetry in the mathematical derivation of the energy gap $\\Delta$ of the paired impurity model on the square lattice $L\\otimes L$ results in an incorrect formula for $\\Delta$. After a correct derivation of the energy gap $\\Delta$ of the cut-off approximation, we show that the usual $\\Delta$ is not the minimal energy gap in the full paired impurity model on $L\\otimes L$. In fact, the minimal energy gap is achieved by the so-called $L\\times L$-term, which describes the long range entanglement of the order parameter, and is related to the $L\\times L$- grassland in the problem of statistical mechanics. We show that the energy gap $\\Delta$ of the cut-off approximation is related to the spectrum of the Laplace operator on the $L\\times L$-term. In particular, the energy gap $\\Delta$ of the cut-off approximation is related to the Casimir energy of the Laplace operator. We show that the energy gap $\\Delta$ of the cut-off approximation exhibits a strong difference between the $L\\otimes L$- and $L\\times L$-terms, which may be related to the difference between the long range entanglement and the short range entanglement in the paired impurity model."}
{"text":"\nWe propose a theory for superconductivity in a magnetic field based on a local approximation approach. Our theory accounts for the anisotropic nature of the superconducting order parameter, the fact that the superconductivity is strongly coupled to the magnetic field, and the energy scales of the problem. Within our framework, superconductivity in a magnetic field is regarded as a competition between anisotropic superconductivity and magnetic order. We determine the minimal anisotropic order parameter and the corresponding symmetry of the superconducting order parameter. Our theory predicts a transition temperature T_c^{*} below which the system is in the normal conducting state with a minimal superconducting order parameter of vanishing magnitude. We also derive a simplified model in which the anisotropic order parameter is replaced by a isotropic one. The predictions of this model are in good agreement with the experimental results for the system with the anisotropic order parameter in a strong magnetic field."}
{"text":"\nWe present a new method for measuring the large-scale structure of the Universe, which combines weak lensing tomography with galaxy clustering. Our technique uses the distribution of galaxies in the galaxies-only and galaxies-and-quasars catalogs from the Dark Energy Survey to measure the large-scale distribution of matter, while using the weak lensing measurements from the same survey to constrain the large-scale structure of the dark energy density. We show that the combination of these two methods results in a measurement of the growth factor of structure Gs(z) that is accurate to 2% and does not require any prior assumptions about the large-scale structure of the Universe. We use our measurement to constrain the dark energy density at the level of 3.5% confidence. Our result is consistent with a flat Universe and a constant dark energy density, within the error limits of our measurement. This is in sharp contrast to the result obtained from galaxy clustering alone, which clearly shows a deviation from a flat Universe. Our result therefore provides a new constraint on the large-scale structure of dark energy. We also find that the shape of the large-scale structure of dark energy is consistent with a Gaussian, as predicted by the standard model of cosmology. Our measurement methodology is independent of the shape of the Universe, the small-scale structure of dark energy, or the non-linear evolution of structure. Our method therefore provides a clean, model-independent measurement of the large-scale structure of dark energy, which is not sensitive to any possible small-scale structure or non-linear evolution."}
{"text":"\nWe consider the constraints that the latest cosmological observations place on f(R) models, which are scalar fields theories with a variable equation of state (f(R) = the function that relates the scalar field variable R to its potential). We show that a f(R) model with a variable equation of state can successfully describe the recent observations, provided that the variable equation of state is very close to a cosmological constant. We consider a possible physical explanation for this result, by analogy with the recently proposed \u2018hypertensor\u2019 model. We also point out that a variable equation of state with a small parameter that is not close to a cosmological constant can successfully describe the recent observations, provided that the parameter is dynamically controlled by the evolution of the Universe. This can be achieved by adding a variable cosmological constant to a model with a variable equation of state, so that the total equation of state is the sum of the two contributions, provided that the cosmological constant contribution is dynamically controlled by the evolution of the Universe. We show that a simple model in which the cosmological constant is related to the variable equation of state by a non-trivial power law can successfully describe the recent observations, provided that the power law parameter is dynamically controlled by the evolution of the Universe."}
{"text":"\n\nWe reconsider the question of the possible violation of parity in hydrogen and show that the original experiment of R.E. Millikan can be significantly improved. The purpose of our experiment is to determine whether there exists a preferred direction in the hydrogen atom, and if so, to what extent this preferred direction is aligned with the nuclear spin. We find that a clear and unambiguous answer to this question requires a more precise determination of the nuclear spin than has been achieved in previous experiments. We present a new and simple method for directly measuring the nuclear spin, and show that previous measurements, which claimed to demonstrate a preferred direction in the hydrogen atom, are in fact consistent with either a preferred direction or complete parity violation. We then present a new analysis of the experimental data that unambiguously demonstrates the existence of a preferred direction in the hydrogen atom. The preferred direction is shown to be aligned with the nuclear spin, as expected from the Dirac equation, and we present a good fit to the data using a model in which the electron's orbit is a function of the nuclear spin. Finally, we present a new and improved version of the Millikan experiment, which we argue can provide unambiguous evidence for or against parity violation in the hydrogen atom."}
