{"text":"\nThis paper studies the connection between ordinary Schroedinger quantum mechanics and a non-standard representation known as polymer quantum mechanics, which has become the focus of interest in recent years due to its potential links to Planck scale physics. We first proceed in deducing polymer quantum mechanics from ordinary quantum mechanics by taking a particular limit, followed by a further consideration of the continuum limit, in which the process of going from the discrete to the Schroedinger description is explored. Resources are put into examining various relevant examples, such as the harmonic oscillator, a free particle and a simple cosmological model."}
{"text":"\nThis work presents an analysis of the c2d Spitzer Legacy observations of the star-forming region of Serpens. We propose criteria to distinguish genuine young stellar objects, YSOs, from the contamination by extra-galactic sources. Using these criteria, we record 286 YSOs in total, 7.5% of which have been identified by previous infrared and X-ray studies. We further analyse the colors of the observed sources and compare them with those of theoretical star\/disk\/envelope models. Objects that appear to be stars plus disks, to the extent of our observational capacity, demonstrate a diverse range of disk properties from active disks to passive disks and even debris disks. We also observe that the luminosity function of YSOs in Serpens extends at least to 0.001 Lsun or lower for a 260-pc distance. Additionally, we observe that less evolved YSOs tend to be more clustered from a spatial correlation analysis."}
{"text":"\nThe spectroscopic observations of IP EX Hydrae in quiescence, which were carried out in 1991 and 2001, are reported. Spin-modulated radial velocities, indicating a place of origin in the outer disc, were newly identified. The velocities were found to be in the range of ~500-600 km\/s, corresponding to material revolving around the Roche lobe radius. Spin Doppler tomograms also suggested accretion curtain emission extending from ~ 500-1000 km\/s, verifying the predictions by the King & Wynn (1999), Belle et al. (2002), and Norton et al. (2004) model. An overflow stream of matter falling onto the magnetosphere was also seen, as proposed in Belle et al. (2005). Moreover, the hbeta and hgamma spin radial velocities appear to be the consequence of the rotation of the funnel at the outer disc edge and the halpha velocities originated from a narrow and a broad-based component close to and far from the white dwarf, respectively, corresponding to the accretion curtain model."}
{"text":"\nThis paper presents two classes of methods for numerically approximating nonlinear stochastic differential equations whose solution evolves on a smooth finite dimensional manifold: namely, Lie group integrators based on the Munthe-Kaas methods, and Castell--Gaines methods. By utilizing Lie groups and their associated Lie algebras, these integrators allow us to pull back and push back the stochastic flow to the underlying manifolds while preserving the form of the flow. For the crucial underlying ordinary differential integrator, we employ the Munthe-Kaas approach, which is known to have better accuracy than the classical Taylor schemes. We apply our methods to the simulation of afree rigid body and an autonomous underwater vehicle being perturbed by independent multiplicative stochastic noise processes, and show that they yield uniformly accurate results."}
{"text":"Thechromosphere of the Sun is enigmatic and has been studied intensively withlimited success in fully understanding its structure and dynamics. This studyexplains how millimeter observations will help to reveal the secrets of thesolar chromosphere. Carried with a sophisticated dynamic model of the solarchromosphere, it was demonstrated that emission in the mm-wavelength range issensitive to dynamic processes in the chromosphere. Moreover, by looking in thisrange, it may be possible to clearly differentiate between different models. Initialobservations at 3.5mm with a resolution of 12 arcsec from the BIMA array yieldedsignificant oscillations with amplitudes of 50-150K and frequencies of 1.5-8 mHzwith a preference for shorter-period oscillations in internetwork regions. Theseresults suggest that higher resolution observations are necessary for a separatestudy of the solar atmosphere, and this is precisely what ALMA can provide."}
{"text":"\nWe explore the capability of detecting non-standard neutrino interactions (NSI) using neutrinos emitted from a supernova. Utilizing a three-neutrino model, we take into account both the NSI-induced resonant conversions that can occur in the interior layers with low lepton number and the modulations of the spectrum of the electron antineutrino due to the passage of shock waves, the varying electron fraction and the effect of Earth's matter. Additionally, we consider whether the neutronization Burstein burst of electron neutrino is detectable. We determine that a significant modification of the electron antineutrino spectrum may be observed if non-universal NSI magnitudes of a few percent or higher flavor-changing NSI above a few $\\times 10^{-5}$ are present."}
{"text":"This paper analyses the number of steady states present in a general multisite phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle, while also exploring how the number of steady states may change under different biological parameters. We show that the number of steady states range from n+1 (if n is even) or n (if n is odd) to a maximum of 2n-1. It is also demonstrated that parameters near the standard Michaelis-Menten quasi-steady state conditions result in a maximum of n+1 steady states, while parameters far from the typical conditions lead to one steady state at most."}
{"text":"\nThis study evaluates the capability of the Discrete Dipole Approximation (DDA) in modelling the light scattering from particles that are much larger than the wave wavelength. We describe a highly efficient, publically-available DDA program that is capable of processing the numerous dipoles required for these kinds of simulations. We examine scattering in spheres for different refractive indices, with the size parameter varying from x=160 to 40, and compare the results of DDA with those of the Mie Theory. The errors in both integral and angle-resolved scattering quantities augment as the refraction index increases, with no discernible relation to the size parameter. Additionally, the computational times required for the simulations rise with the size parameter as well as refraction index, taking up to 2 weeks on a cluster system composed of 64 processors. Aside from its functionality to parallelize a single DDA simulation over multiple computers, this computer program's leading feature is its ability to simulate the scattering of very large particles. Eventually, we provide a discussion of possible solutions to the current restrictions in the program."}
{"text":"\nThe scalar radius of the pion, \\la r^2\\ra^\\pi_s, is of great significance in determining the \\pi\\pi scattering behaviour. Recently, Yndur\\'ain derived an Omn\\`es representation of the I=0 non-strange pion scalar form factor that gives \\la r^2\\ra^\\pi_s=0.75\\pm 0.07 fm^2. This value contrasts sharply with the 0.61\\pm 0.04 calculated by Muskhelishvili-Omn\\`es equations. We reexamined Yndur\\'ain's approach and discovered that by preserving continuity between the input \\pi\\pi phase shifts, there is an implicit requirement for a zero in the form factor. With this taken into account, the revised value is \\la r^2\\ra_s^\\pi=0.65\\pm 0.05 fm^2. The principal source of uncertainty comes from the current experimental errors of the low energy S-wave I=0 \\pi\\pi phase shifts, along with the not yet established QCD asymptotic phase of the scalar form factor."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate the notion of a quantum group of isometries for classical and noncommutative manifolds, formulated as the assignment of a compact quantum group to a given manifold in order to define a smooth, isometric action. We identify the quantum isometry group as the universal object in the category of 'quantum families of smooth isometries', introduced by Woronowicz and Soltan. We demonstrate a unitary representation of the quantum isometry group on the space of forms, and present explicit descriptions of the quantum isometry groups of commutative and noncommutative tori. This allows us to obtain a quantum double torus, as the universal quantum group of holomorphic isometries of the noncommutative torus."}
{"text":"\nThis paper presents an entropy-based approach to controlling spurious oscillations in the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM). We develop and analyze two families of entropy limiters that are designed to eliminate undesired numerical effects while leaving smooth solutions unchanged. Compared to flux limiters used in finite difference, finite volumes and finite elements methods, the entropy limiters developed here offer additional advantages such as better control of entropy production and more accurate estimates of artificial dissipation added to the simulation. We test the limiters on two standard benchmarks, a 1D athermal shock tube and a 2D lid-driven cavity, and demonstrate that they perform well over the range of Reynolds numbers Re between 2000 and 7500 on a coarse 100x100 grid. The efficacy of the limiters is demonstrated for both entropic and non-entropic quasiequilibria."}
{"text":"\nThis paper examines the turbulent process that takes place in astrophysics plasmas, such as the solar wind, interstellar medium, galaxy clusters, and accretion disks. We hypothesize that the turbulence is composed of two components-- kinetic and fluid-- operating at different scales with respect to the mean magnetic field. We propose that energy injected at the outer scale dissipates to collisions, creating a kinetic cascade which converts the energy into heat. The process is separated into multiple scale ranges; in the inertial range, it takes the form of an Alfvenic cascade observed in RMHD equations, while compressive fluctuations are found to obey a linear kinetic equation. In the dissipation range, we find two cascades: a KAW cascade governed by Electron RMHD equations and a passive phase-space cascade. The latter suggests that ion entropy fluctuates, dampened by wave-particle interaction, before collisional heating takes place. With respect to these observations, we provide scaling relations to help explain the phenomena. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings in various astrophysical and space-physical scenarios."}
{"text":"\nThe present paper investigates the evolution of solitary wave and undular bore propagation in shallow-water flows across a gradual slope affected by bottom friction. Using the Whitham averaging approach for perturbed integrable equations, this study goes beyond current understanding of wave effects by incorporating the Chezy law for variable topography and bottom friction. It shows the effects of these two factors on the propagation of undular bores, with special attention paid to the global restrictions and the additional solitary wave amplitude growth that can arise. A traditional adiabatic approach does not account for this non-local effect, which can be expected from nonlinear wave interactions within the bore."}
{"text":"This article presents Part I of an exploration into locating simultaneous, continuous acoustic emission sources. This intelligent acoustic emission locator utilizes a combination of a sensor antenna and a general regression neural network to solve the problem of non-destructive testing of aircraft frame structures. Testing results assessed the locator's performance based on sound velocity and attenuation of the specimen, dimensions of the testing area, and the data stored. Comparable accuracy to traditional triangulation methods was obtained by this intelligent locator with the additional benefit of avoiding an analysis of sonic ray paths---resulting in a more general application of the locator. Part II further examines this technology with its focus on blind source separation, time delay estimation, and locating two sources."}
{"text":"This paper provides a comprehensive global perspective of the theory of special Finsler manifolds. Definitions, relationships and results of such manifolds, along with identities and properties of their torsion and curvature tensor fields are studied and examined, in particular, locally Minkowskian, Berwald, Landesberg, general Landesberg, $P$-reducible, $C$-reducible, semi-$C$-reducible, quasi-$C$-reducible, $P^{*}$-Finsler, $C^{h}$-recurrent, $C^{v}$-recurrent, $C^{0}$-recurrent, $S^{v}$-recurrent, $S^{v}$-recurrent of the second order, $C_{2}$-like, $S_{3}$-like, $S_{4}$-like, $P_{2}$-like, $R_{3}$-like, $P$-symmetric, $h$-isotropic, of scalar curvature, of constant curvature, of $p$-scalar curvature, and of $s$-$ps$-curvature. Additionally, an appendix is presented providing local information of the special Finsler manifolds studied."}
{"text":"This article addresses the intercalation of potassium into graphite by means of first-principle theory. To correctly quantify the intercalate formationenergy, it is necessary to properly account for the nonlocal dispersive interactions that determine the binding between the layers of graphite. This is accomplished by combining ordinary density functional theory (DFT) with a van der Waals density functional (vdW-DF) approach. Results indicate that the use of vdW-DF stabilizes the graphite crystal, with crystal parameters in agreement with experiments. Results for graphite and potassium-intercalated graphite include: intercalate formation energy, binding separation, layer binding energy, bulk modulus, adsorption energy, and sub-surface potassium absorption energy. Compared to the traditional semilocal approach, the use of vdW-DF weakly softens the elastic response."}
{"text":"\nWe present evidence of the mass and radius of the unseen M-dwarf companion in the single-lined eclipsing binary HAT-TR-205-013. This system of two stars have a period of $P=2.230736 \\pm 0.000010$ days and an orbit near zero eccentricity, $e=0.012 \\pm 0.021$. We calculate the surface gravity of the secondary star from the characterisitics of the light curve and spectroscopic orbit which yields a unique mass-radius line. In addition, the radial velocity of the primary star gives a radius value of $R_{\\rm A} = 1.28 \\pm 0.04$ \\rsun and hence the radius of the secondary as $R_{\\rm B} = 0.167 \\pm 0.006$ \\rsun, with a semimajor axis of $a = 7.54 \\pm 0.30 \\rsun = 0.0351 \\pm 0.0014$ AU. From the semimajor axis and spectroscopic orbit, we derive individual masses, $M_{\\rm B} = 0.124 \\pm 0.010$ \\msun and $M_{\\rm A} = 1.04 \\pm 0.13$ \\msun, for both components. Our result lies above the theoretical mass-radius models from the Lyon group, which is in agreement with double-lined eclipsing binary systems. Our method provides a way to study stars of the lower end of the stellar mass-radius relation."}
{"text":"This article examines the relationship between different kinds of generalized cosine transforms and their application to $\\lam$-intersection bodies, a special class of star bodies, including $k$-intersection bodies and finite dimensional subspaces of $L_p$-spaces. We discover that the spherical Radon transform and the generalized cosine transform maintain their integral-geometric structure when restricted onto lower dimensional subspaces. We use this result to develop new characterizations of $\\lam$-intersection bodies and provide examples. Additionally, we also include a review of known facts and offer novel proofs for them."}
{"text":"\nWe use the superfield formalism to examine the off-shell and on-shell nilpotent Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) and anti-BRST symmetry of the (3+1)-dimensional (4D) (non-)Abelian 1-form gauge theories. This enables us to comprehend the relevant geometric aspects of (i) the nilpotent symmetry and (ii) the Lagrangian densities by analyzing the 4D ordinary gauge theories in a (4,2) dimensional supermanifold defined by four spacetime coordinates x^\\mu (\\mu=0,1,2,3) and the Grassmannian variables \\theta and \\bar\\theta. Moreover, this formalism allows us to greatly simplify the understanding of the nilpotent symmetry."}
{"text":"This article examines the Littlewood-Richardson polynomials, a family of rings of symmetric functions depending on an infinite sequence of parameters. We provide a combinatorial rule for calculating the structure coefficients of these polynomials, as well as a manifestly positive formula for their calculation in the sense of W. Graham. Additionally, we use these polynomials to calculate the product of equivariant Schubert classes on Grassmannians and to describe the multiplication rule in the algebra of the Casimir elements for the general linear Lie algebra. By doing so, we establish a stability property of the structure coefficients and provide a manifestly positive formula for such an expansion, first addressed by A. Knutson and T. Tao using combinatorics of puzzles."}
{"text":"\nThis paper examines the permissible algebraic commutation relations in the Lagrangian quantum theory involving free scalar, spinor and vector fields. Firstly, the Heisenberg equations\/relations of the dynamical variables and a specific condition for the uniqueness of the its operators are used as sources for these commutation relations. It is suggested that the paracommutation relations or some of their generalizations constitute the most general ones for maintaining validity of all Heisenberg equations. However, the problem arises when attempting to simultaneously fulfill the Heisenberg equations and the uniqueness requirement. A redefinition of the dynamical variables, similar to the normal ordering process, provides a solution, which alters the admissible commutation relations. The incorporation of the concept of the vacuum then limits the possible commutation relations. This eventually simplifies the redefinition of the dynamical variables to simple normal ordering. The requirements of an efficient method of calculating vacuum mean values is the last restriction posed on the commutation relations, leaving the conventional bilinear commutation relations as the only ones shown to satisfy all these conditions, and not contradicting existing data."}
{"text":"\nThis research examines the spatial order of epitaxial self-assembled quantum dots (SAQDs) necessary for the development of functioning optoelectronic and electronic devices. Using linear analysis on a commonly used model, formulas for characterizing SAQD spatial order and corresponding correlation lengths are obtained. It is found that small correlation lengths occur when wetting potential is not present but increase when SAQDs are formed at a near-critical film height. Furthermore, the relationship between SAQD order and anisotropy is evaluated, as well as mathematical aspects to statistically analyze SAQD formation and order."}
{"text":"This article explores the construction of uniquely determined dynamical objects that are invariant under the pullback action of a (not necessarily invertible) smooth self-map of a compact manifold. Taking advantage of differences in expansion rates between terms inside of a sheaf cohomological long exact sequence, we are able to lift finite-dimensional invariant subspaces from one term to the preceding one, which then allows for the formation of unique invariant currents and measures of a given type. We also discuss conditions for which the subsheaf cohomology of these currents is identical to the sheaf cohomology, as well as conditions to canonically identify the sheaf cohomology of the currents to the deRham cohomology groups. Our theorem can be applied to both smooth and holomorphic settings."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate the relation of the Milky Way's globular cluster mass function (GCMF) to the half-mass density of clusters (rho_h). We demonstrate that a greater rho_h leads to higher turnover mass (M_TO) and a narrower GCMF. We interpret this pattern as evidence that the mass of a cluster is gradually drained away through two-body relaxation-driven evaporation proceses. Our model, which likens cluster evaporation rates to -dM\/dt = mu_ev ~ rho_h^{1\/2}, is supported by observed GCMFs in terms of their dependence on rho_h, central concentration c, and Galactocentric distance r_gc. Our interpretation contradicts a literal 'universality' of M_TO to r_gc, showing instead that it is the varying M_TO with rho_h combined with random scatter in rho_h as a function of r_gc that explains this result. We propose other forms of the loss rate including mu_ev ~ rho_t^{1\/2} and mu_ev ~ Sigma_t^{3\/4}, demonstrating their consistency with the GCMF. We conclude that the timescale of cluster lifetime required for our model is standardly meaningful."}
{"text":"This paper examines the dynamics of bright solitons with finite background in spinor Bose-Einstein Condensates (BECs) that are modeled as a matrix nonlinear Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation with self-focusing nonlinearity. The inverse scattering method is employed to study soliton solutions that have been extended from vanishing boundary conditions. These solitons are classified into two types termed 'domain-wall' (DW) or 'phase-shift' (PS) depending on their behavior at infinity. The DW type corresponds to a ferromagnetic state with a non-zero total spin, while the PS type carries a zero total spin meaning a polar state. The collisions of two solitons are further researched and the spin-mixing is confirmed in a collision involving a DW type. Moreover, the robustness and the usefulness of solitons in spinor BECs are emphasized."}
{"text":"\nThis paper presents a path integral approach to understanding the origin of the Universe, exploring why there is something rather than nothing. A density matrix of the Universe is proposed, and it is demonstrated that this corresponds to a uniform but peaked distribution in the phase space of true physical variables. In terms of observable spacetime geometry, this is represented by a set of cosmological instantons with a limited range of cosmological constants. These cosmological instantons lead to accelerating inflationary cosmologies with a low-energy scale, allowing for the concept of dynamic extra dimensions. Thus, this microcanonical ensemble suggests a mechanism for constraining the landscape of string vacua, and could potentially provide an explanation for the dark energy phenomenon via the quasi-equilibrium decay of the Universe's microcanonical state."}
{"text":"\nIn this article, we use the method of granular hydrodynamics to analyze the process of clustering of particles which occurs due to inelastic collisions in a very dilute and cooling gas. By taking into account the effects of bulk energy losses, we employ Lagrangian coordinates and solve the equation of ideal gas dynamics to obtain a family of exact, non-stationary analytical solutions that depend on one spatial coordinate. This solution exhibits a new type of singularity, where the density of the gas blows up in finite time from smooth initial conditions. As $t_c$ (the time of density blow-up) approaches, the maximum density follows a power law of $\\sim (t_c - t)^{-2}$. The velocity remains continuous, forming a cusp rather than a shock at the singularity, and the temperature drops to zero. Additionally, there is an exact solution which shows that the density blowup can coexist with an ordinary shock, where fields are discontinuous but finite. We conclude that such solutions are stable by numerically solving the hydrodynamic equations, as well as verifying that it follows the same pattern independently of initial and boundary conditions."}
{"text":"\nIn this paper, we analyze the property of universality that arises when considering covariant field theories in space-time expanded around pp-wave backgrounds. We show that the space-time lagrangian density evaluated on a certain restricted set of field configurations, referred to as the universal sector, is the same across all pp-waves, even when they are off-shell, if they contain the same transverse space and have identical background scalar profiles. We focus our attention on tensorial fields only. When applicable to bosonic string theory, we find that universality implies the existence of a universal sector of world-sheet operators whose correlation functions are independent of the pp-wave properties of the metric and background gauge flux. We also use non-polynomial closed string field theory as a means to examine off-shell pp-waves with a flat transverse space and a dilaton that is not dependent on the transverse coordinates. We show that the field transformation linking the low-energy effective field theory and CSFT, having excluded all massive modes, is limited to a quadratic level in fields. Therefore, the off-shell pp-waves can be detected on either side. We additionally propose an iterative method for computing higher massive modes in CSFT through the equations of motion, given the existing massless pp-wave field configurations. All of our considerations regarding the bosonic string theory can also be carried over to the common Neveu-Schwarz sector of superstrings."}
{"text":"\nThis study presents the spectroscopic, energetic, and temporal characteristics of radiation in conjunction with the photonic flame effect. When an artificial opal is placed on a copper plate cooled to liquid nitrogen's boiling point (77 K) and illuminated with a nanosecond ruby laser pulse, a long-term luminescence lasting up to ten seconds with a finely structured spectrum is generated in the antistokes part of the spectrum. A similar delayed luminescence was observed in other opal samples on the same plate. The luminescence threshold was found to be reduced and the spatial distribution of the bright emitting area on the opal surface altered when the opal was infused with nonlinear liquids. Additionally, long-term blue bright luminescence took place in frozen samples of nonlinear liquids when placed on the copper plate, with temporal characteristics similar to opal matrices."}
{"text":"This article presents a general approach to the statistical modeling of physical laws,  centering around the use of a kernel estimator to express the probability density function of measured variables. Subsequently, the physical law is determined and extracted from experimental data with a conditional average estimator. Using an example of a return map of noisy chaotic data, the nonparametric regression is used to infer a future value of chaotic time series from the present one. A new definition of predictor cost function is formulated using mean predictor error and the mean square distance between data points. The optimal number of data for the model is then estimated from the minimum point of the cost function."}
{"text":"\nIn this article, we explore the implications of timing and lensing observations of the colliding Bullet Clusters to estimate the amount of dark matter in the merged galaxy. Utilizing particle orbits and potential models that fit the lensing data, we find {\\it barely adequate} models of Cold Dark Matter (CDM) with Newtonian gravity in which the bullet subhalo possesses a total mass of around $1\\times 10^{15}\\msun$ and moves at a speed of $3000\\kms$, while the 'bullet' X-ray gas can move at a rate of $4200\\kms$. These velocities represent near the high end of what is hope to be manageable by the gravity of two truncated CDM halos in a Hubble period, even without taking into account the influence of ram pressure. If the upper extremes of bullet gas speed ($5000-5400\\kms$) are accepted, the consistency breaks down, and the gas would not remain bound to the sub-cluster halo for the entire Hubble time. Models with V_{DM} = 4500\\kms ~ V_{gas} would necessitate an excessive amount of CDM for a cluster holding $~10^{14}\\msun$ of gas. Our conclusions are applicable beyond General Relativity, for example, a velocity of $4500\\kms$ is easily achieved in the relativistic MONDian lensing model of Angus et al. (2007). Moreover, MONDian models with a marginal quantity of Hot Dark Matter ($M_{HDM} \u2264 0.6\\times 10^{15}\\msun$) and CDM models with reduced halo mass ($ \u2264 1\\times 10^{15}\\msun$) are just barely consistent with both lensing and velocity data."}
{"text":"\nThis article considers inequalities related to those of Ando and Zhan, namely the non-negative convex and concave functions $f$ and $g$ on $[0,\\infty)$ with a unitarily invariant norm. More recently, these inequalities have been extended by Bourin and Uchiyama, and Kosem with non-negative concave functions $f$ and convex $g$. Here, the question focuses whether the inequalities obtained by Ando for operator monotone $f$ with inverse $g$, $||| f(A)-f(B) ||| \\le ||| f(|A-B|) |||$ and $||| g(A)-g(B) ||| \\ge ||| g(|A-B|) |||$ respectively, also have a generalization to non-negative concave $f$ and convex $g$. The answer to this is generally negative in the case of general matrices and positively in that of $A \u2265 ||B||$. This work introduces the newly defined concept of $Y$-dominated majorization of the spectra of two Hermitian matrices and its related property, which is effectively used to strengthen the results obtained by Bourin-Uchiyama and Kosem."}
{"text":"This paper studies how quark-quark and antiquark-antiquark double scattering in an nuclear medium affect quark and antiquark fragmentation functions, a process commonly referred to as multiple parton scattering. Results show that this modification is orders of magnitude smaller than those from quark-gluon scattering due to the factor of $C_F\/C_A=4\/9$. This modification is not insignificant for realistic kinematics and is seen to be dependent on the quark or antiquark distributions in the medium. It is further seen to cause an asymmetry between quark and antiquark fragmentation functions, leading to a flavor dependence of the leading hadron suppression in semi-inclusive DIS off nuclear targets. Additionally, quark-antiquark annihilation results in a mixing of quark and gluon fragmentation functions in the large fractional momentum region of heavy-ion collisions, causing a flavor dependence of jet quenching."}
{"text":"A breakthrough was achieved with the development of a Langmuir Blodgett (LB)\nmethod for assembling densely aligned single walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs)\nfrom bulk materials.

{"text":"The nonlinear dynamics of the phonon stimulated emission in the nonautonomous microwave solid-state resonator of the phaser generator has been studied both through experiments and numerical simulations. An increase in the electrical pumping levels of the system revealed the branching of the emission states and its long-term refractory time, in accordance with the analytical estimations of its density in the phase space. The refractorie nature of the emission pulses was determined to be related to strange attractors crashing with the unstable periodic components of the higher branches of the emission states."}
{"text":"\nBy utilizing a first-order reversal curve (FORC) method, we investigate and capture the magnetic \"fingerprints\" of billions of sub-100 nm Fe nanodots as they transition between single-domain to vortex states. We observe that, as the size of the nanodot increases from 52 nm to 67 nm, the FORC diagrams present clear distinctions, despite only slight changes in the major hysteresis loops. The 52 nanometer nanodots possess single-domain behavior, which is supported by the coercivity distributions taken from the FORC distributions in comparison to calculations based on the measured nanodot size distribution. In addition, the 58 and 67 nanometer nanodots display vortex states, with the nucleation and annihilation of the vortices seeing expression as butterfly-like features in the FORC distribution, which is further verified by micromagnetic simulations. By the same token, the FORC technique permits a quantitative assessment of the magnetic phase fractions, and vortex nucleation and annihilation fields."}

{"text":"We have studied the properties of orbits that travel very close to an extremal Kerr black hole, a situation that deviates substantially from Newtonian intuition. In particular, when the black hole spin is very large (J\/M > 0.9524M), the angular momentum of the orbit increases - as opposed to 'normal' orbits - with increasing inclination towards the equatorial plane. This phenomenon, which has previously been observed for circular orbits, has now been extended to all generic orbits, both circular and eccentric, that reach very close to the horizon of the black hole and has been dubbed \"nearly horizon-skimming orbits\". Our study of these orbits showed that, according to the most up-to-date calculations based on Teukolsky-fluxes, the inclination of these orbits increases over time; although, the rate of increase is very small. As such, it is unlikely that these orbits will have an observable effect on the gravitational waveforms that could be observed by the space-based observatory LISA."}

It discusses the circulation of fluid surrounding a vortex, the quantization of vortices in superfluids, and their wide occurrence. It examines the observation of single vortices, vortex lattices, and vortex pairs and rings in BECs, as well as the observation of quantized vortices in a fermionic gas indicating the resultant condensation and superfluidity of fermion pairs. It then considers other fields involving quantized vortices, such as superfluid Helium, nonlinear optics, and type-II superconductors."}
{"text":"\nThis work examines the longitudinal and transversal spin decoherence times, $T_1$ and $T_2$ in semiconductor quantum dots using the equation-of-motion approach while taking into account different magnetic fields, dot sizes, and temperatures. The factors that affect spin decoherence, such as hyperfine interaction with the environment, Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling, $g$-factor fluctuations, and spin-phonon interactions due to phonon-induced strains, are contrasted with the equation-of-motion approach in both the Markovian and non-Markovian limits. Additionally, the effects of spin-orbit coupling and temperature on the spin relaxation time are explored. Results point to spin dephasing being more efficient at high temperatures as opposed to spin relaxation, causing the two to only differ by a factor of two at low temperatures."}

The study also scrutinizes the discrepancy in double-peaked susceptibility and specific heat of the system at finite temperatures, where the peak positions and intensities are dependent on the competition of the couplings, thus displaying quite different behaviours when subjected to the XXZ anisotropy with regards to the F and AF couplings. Finally, the theoretical predictions of susceptibility, specific heat and magnetization for the compound Cu$_{3}$(CO$_{3}$)$_{2}$(OH)$_{2}$ are examined in comparison to the experiments."}
{"text":"In this article, a reliable approach is presented for extracting an accurate physical law y=yo(x) from joint experimental data concerning x and y. The probability density functions (PDFs) of joint, marginal, and conditional data are evaluated using an estimator integrated with the instrument scattering function. Optimal estimator estimator values are estimated using the conditional average. To analyze the accuracy of this estimator, a new prediction quality definition is proposed. The joint experimental information and the redundancy of the joint measurements are analyzed via relative entropy. It is found that with the number of experiments, the redundancy increases while the experimental information eventually converges to an end-limit value. The difference between this ending value and the initial experimental value signifies the variance between the experimentally determined properties of the phenomenon and their actual properties. This discrepancy measure is combined with the redundancy to generate a cost function whose minima is used to determine the precise number of data elements needed for the extraction of the law yo(x). Mutual Information is calculated by means of the marginal and conditional PDFs. The ratio of Mutual Information and Marginal Information indicates which variable is independent. These statistics and their properties are demonstrated with deterministic and random variables."}
{"text":"\nThis paper details a computer program to accurately and efficiently predict the intensities of atomic and molecular lines created in interstellar environments. The program takes into account various collisional, radiative processes and the external radiation coming from background sources. The optically thick effects are calculated with escape probability method. In addition to this, the paper also provides links to the molecular data files stored in the Leiden Atomic Molecular Database (LAMDA). These data files are always being improved. Furthermore, the paper compares the performance of this proposed program with other existing methods (approximate and more advanced). To conclude, it provides diagnostic plots to determine physical manifestations based on intensity-ratios of commonly observed molecules. This program will surely serve as an essential tool for analyzing the observations from present and future radio and infrared telescopes."}
{"text":"\nAn analysis of experimental data redundancy and related statistics is presented which provides a method to approximately calculate the entropy, a measure of the complexity of the natural phenomena being explored. The approximate expression of redundancy only involves a sum of the experimental data which makes it more efficient than conventional calculation of entropy. This approach allows for an estimation of the complexity of the phenomenon, as well as a determination of the optimal number of experiments needed for full exploration. The efficacy of the approach is demonstrated on normally distributed two-dimensional random data."}
{"text":"This paper is concerned with the study, classification, and elimination of smooth codimension-one foliations on a smooth manifold $M$, with Morse-type isolated singularities. Additionally, the paper seeks to determine if classical results, such as those of Haefliger and Novikov, concerning the existence of non-degenerate singular points and closed transverse curves, respectively, still hold in the presence of singularities. To this end, we first describe the possible configurations of pairs of singularities and the corresponding codimension invariant sets. We then provide an elimination procedure for suitable center-saddle and saddle-saddle configurations. In the second part of the paper, we define weakly stable components of the singular set, $Sing(\\F)$, as those components admitting a neighborhood where all the leaves are compact. If $Sing(\\F)$ contains only such components, which are smoothly embedded curves diffeomorphic to $S^1$, we can prove an extension of Haefliger's theorem. Finally, if the foliation possesses a closed curve, transverse to it, then a Novikov-like result is attained."}
{"text":"The extraction of the weak phase $\\alpha$ from $B\\to\\pi\\pi$ decays has been the subject of debate from a statistical standpoint with the frequentist-bayesian confrontation. This article examines several questions that have been disregarded but that are important for understanding the extraction of $\\alpha$. Reparametrization Invariance (RI) is used to ascertain that certain Standard Model inspired parametrizations can be inaccurate or inadequate if they move beyond the minimal Gronau-London assumptions. These assumptions include the single weak phase $\\alpha$, just in the $\\Delta I=3\/2$ amplitudes, the isospin relations and experiment data. After assessing these issues, the author uses several applicable parametrizations to extract $\\alpha$, finding no noteworthy discrepancy between the frequentist and bayesian outcomes. Most significantly, RI shows that values of $\\alpha \\sim \\pi\/4$ are ruled out, even if New Physics might be contributing to the $\\Delta I=1\/2$ component."}

{"text":"This article investigates the dependence of tensile properties on temperature for 20 layered (10,10) single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) using an O(N) tight binding molecular dynamics (TBMD) simulation. Results demonstrate that the SWCNT exhibits structural stability at 300K with strain values of 0.23 in elongation and 0.06 in compression. Additionally, the elastic limit, Young's modulus, tensile strength, and Poisson ratio are calculated as 0.10, 0.395 TPa, 83.23 GPa, and 0.285, respectively at 300K. When temperatures rise from 300K to 900K, Young's modulus and the tensile strength decrease, whereas the Poisson ratio increases. Contrarily, when the temperature rises from 1200K to 1800K, the SWCNT starts to become deformed and softened, and applying strain to these softened SWCNTs do not conform to the same pattern observed in the temperature range of 300K to 900K."}
{"text":"\nUsing observations from the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE), we studied the influence of the transverse proximity effect on the UV radiation field in the line of sight to the quasar HE2347-4342. We identified 14 quasars in its vicinity, including three in the foreground of HE2347-4342, and analysed the HI and HeII absorption properties of the intergalactic medium surrounding these quasars. Our results indicate that the UV spectral shape near HE2347-4342 and in the vicinity of the three foreground quasars is statistically harder than expected from UV background models dominated by quasars, indicating the presence of a transverse proximity effect in the form of a local hardening of the UV radiation field. While this hardening was most significant in the projected vicinity of QSOJ23495-4338, we were unable to determine further constraints on the shape of the ionising field due to three highly ionised metal line systems in their vicinity. Our findings point to the significance of radiative transfer in the intergalactic medium, as well as a lower limit of ~25 Myr on the quasar lifetime obtained from the transverse proximity effect of QSOJ23495-4338."}
{"text":"\nThis work investigates the natural generalization of the groups G_{k,1} of Richard Thompson and Graham Higman to monoids, called M_{k,1}, and to inverse monoids, called Inv_{k,1}. This research shows that these monoids and inverse monoids are both congruence-simple and J-0-simple when all k are considered. Furthermore, they possess k-1 nontrivial D-classes. Connections to the multiplicative part of the Cuntz algebra O_k, as well as finite and infinite generating sets, are explored. Results show that the word problem for M_{k,1} and Inv_{k,1} is decidable for any finite generating set, and for certain infinite sets is coNP-complete.

{"text":"\nIn this article, we analyze the validity of the SK assumption that the direction of the incident neutrino is the same as that of the detected charged lepton for Fully Contained Events and Partially Contained Events due to QEL. We develop a Time Sequential Monte Carlo Simulation to simulate every physical process concerned in order to determine the accuracy of this SK assumption. By comparing the zenith angle distribution of the emitted muons under the SK assumption and the one produced by the Time Sequential Simulation, we conclude that the measurement of the direction of the incident neutrino for the events occurring inside the detector in the SK analysis is not reliable, regardless of whether or not neutrino oscillation exists."}
{"text":"\nBy analyzing the entire Protein Data Bank, we unveil several intricate knots found within proteins. These unique geometries play a crucial role in the functionality of many proteins and have allowed for the preservation of certain characteristics across species. Amongst them is the most intricate knot discovered to date in a human enzyme, ubiquitin hydrolase, which serves as a protective mechanism against degradation. Additionally, we expose a unique knot found only in some transcarbamylases leading to a shift in the enzymatic function of the protein. This suggests that the simple insertion of a small amount of DNA could be enough to create this transition. Altogether, our research brings forth revolutionary insights regarding protein knot structures and their impacts on evolution and functionality."}
{"text":"\nWe explore the effects of fluctuating environment on an electrostatic qubit through a model of single electron transistor (SET). We look into the dynamics of the qubit to determine its decoherence and relaxation rates, and the spectral density of its fluctuating parameters. In weak-coupled systems, we find the decoherence and relaxation rates are associated with the spectral density at the Rabi frequency or zero frequency depending on the parameter. Even with the back-action of the qubit, this correlation still occurs. In contrast, in strong coupling or when the back-action is strong, the correlation no longer holds. Our model also exhibits localization of the qubit, similar to that of the spin-boson model, when the coupling is strong."}
{"text":"This article examines the use of average sensitivity to analyze random Boolean networks. This extends upon prior work by James Lynch to prove Kauffman's conjecture; that in random networks, few ineffective and freezing gates exist in the ordered phase, and many in the disordered phase. Setting $\\lambda$ as the expectation of average sensitivity, we use Lynch's proof to analyze networks with arbitrary connectivity and biased Boolean functions. We further deduce the expectation of average sensitivity when a specific connectivity and bias of functions are randomly chosen."}
{"text":"Given a finite irreducible Coxeter group $W$, we present a methodology that facilitates the calculation of the number of decompositions, of a given Coxeter element, into subgroups with types drawn from a specific finite set. Moreover, we describe how to apply this technique to count multi-chains in Armstrong's generalised non-crossing partitions poset. We demonstrate that our results enable the solution of the problem of rank-selected chain enumeration in the type $D_n$ generalised non-crossing partitions poset, verifying the $F=M$ Conjecture in this setting."}
{"text":"\nWe present the results of a census conducted by the Spitzer Space Telescope on the IC 348 nebula and its embedded star cluster. This census was complemented with ground-based spectra, adding a total of 42 class II T-Tauri stars to the cluster. About 20 class 0\/I protostars have also been identified. We estimate that the total population of IC 348 is of the order of 400 sources after accounting for unidentified, diskless members. Our Spitzer census revealed an anti-correlated spatial distribution between protostars and T-Tauri stars, which form the cluster's central condensation around a B star. The protostars are mostly located at the periphery of the cluster, forming a protostellar ridge about 1 pc away from the B star. This ridge exhibits a star formation rate consistent with the one that built the exposed cluster. Additionally, we identify fifteen cold, starless cores interspersed among the protostar population, suggesting that the IC 348 nebula is still in the process of forming stars. We estimate that IC 348 is a few crossing times old and its smooth radial profile and confirmed mass segregation indicate it is a relaxed cluster. From the results of this census, we can infer that star formation in dark clouds can be a much longer process than previously thought."}

{"text":"\nWe study the capacity of a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) fading channel enabled by using a quantized selection of a transmit precoding matrix. With the help of the receiver's feedback, the strongest channel modes can be activated. Random Vector Quantization (RVQ) is considered to select the precoding matrix from a random codebook composed of independent and isotropically distributed entries. The performance of RVQ is examined in comparison to a simpler reduced-rank scalar quantization scheme, in which the beamformer is limited to rest on a random subspace. By assuming i.i.d. channel elements known to the receiver, the large system capacity of the beamforming is calculated for increasing values of feedback. It is found that RVQ is asymptotically optimal, meaning no other quantization can achieve a larger rate. An approximate analysis is also conducted for the arbitrary rank precoding matrix and the optimal and linear receivers (matched filter and Minimum Mean Squared Error). Results from finite-size systems are closely consistent with the approximations. Finally, the amount of feedback for linear MMSE is observed to be only slightly larger than for the optimal receiver, while the matched filter may demand substantially more feedback."}
{"text":"\nThis study investigates the hydrodynamics, non-thermal radio emission, and X-ray emission of the Galactic non-thermal radio source G328.4+0.2 to ascertain its nature as either a pulsar wind nebula or supernova remnant. With the help of X-ray data from XMM, a high resolution 1.4 GHz image from the Australia Telescope Compact Array and deep radio pulsation searches from the Parkes Radio Telescope, we are able to determine the physical properties of G328.4+0.2. Analysis of the radio emission reveals a flat spectrum in most areas and a steeper index of -0.3 in some parts of the eastern edge. A hydrodynamic model indicates that G328.4+0.2 is a young (< 10,000 year old) PWN with a low magnetic field (< 10^12 G) neutron star created by an energetic (> 10^51 ergs), low mass (< 5 Solar Masses) supernova explosion which occurred in a low density (n~0.03 cm^{-3}) environment."}
{"text":"\nResults from the STAR experiment on 3-particle correlations in $pp$, d+Au and Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=200 GeV are discussed. Through comparison of the away-side shape in central Au+Au, relative to $pp$, d+Au and peripheral Au+Au collisions, several scenarios are proposed to explain the modification of two-particle correlations including: gluon radiation, jet deflection, energy loss, and conical flow. Three-particle correlations are used to differentiate these scenarios to determine if a Mach-cone conical flow is present. The $p_T$ dependence of the observed shapes is used to distinguish conical emission from sonic booms and Cerenkov radiation. The combinatorial backgrounds and flow harmonics v2 and v4 are studied in detail, with the implications of the results for the presence of conical flow discussed."}
{"text":"\nThe X-ray emission of the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 3783 has been closely inspected with XMM-Newton in an effort to probe, through orbital motions, the innermost regions around the black hole. Our analysis revealed a time-variable and redshifted Fe K line emission that is correlated to the source continuum on a time-scale of 27 ks. This value agrees with the local dynamical time-scale of the black hole disc at 10 r_g. The line shape and overall X-ray pattern suggest the origin of the line likely lies in the vicinity of the black hole, under its large gravitational field."}
{"text":"This article provides an approach to tackling the P vs. NP and related problems through geometric complexity theory (GCT). This approach, known as the flip, reduces the negative hypothesis in complexity theory (the lower bound problems) to the positive hypothesis (the upper bound problems). This article proposes to realise the flip by reducing the needed complexity-theoretic positive hypotheses to showing that certain, relaxed forms of decision problems belong to the P complexity class. This is in reference to proving that the fundamental structural constants in representation theory and algebraic geometry exist with nonnegative coefficients (positive formulae) and functions associated with them. These functions have similar positivity properties as the Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials and the multiplicative structural constants of the canonical (global crystal) bases in the theory of Drinfeld-Jimbo quantum groups. The proposed approach links the truth of the P vs. NP conjecture in characteristic zero to the Riemann hypothesis over finite fields and its associated problems."}
{"text":"This research delves into the mineralogy of two newly identified basaltic asteroids in the outer Main Belt (a > 2.85 AU). Observations were conducted at the Calar Alto Observatory, Spain during November and December of 2006. Spectral features characteristic of V-type asteroids were found; however, a shallow absorption feature was discovered around 0.65 microns that had never been observed before in basaltic asteroids with the same intensity. It was postulated that this was caused by the presence of chromium. Results reveal (1459) Magnya, asteroids (7472) Kumakiri, and (10537) 1991 RY16 could possibly be the currently known only basaltic bodies present in the outer Main Belt."}
{"text":"\nAstrometric accuracy approaching 10 microarcseconds through the use of Very\nLong Baseline Arrays (VLBA) and beyond can enable the discovery and  characterization  of  exoplanets.  We  present  RIPL,  the  Radio  Interferometric  Planet Search, a program which will survey 29 low-mass, active stars with the VLBA and the Green Bank 100m Telescope. With the upgrade of the VLBA bandwidth, the astrometric accuracy could improve by an order of magnitude while the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) could potentially achieve an unprecedented 1 microarcsecond detection and characterization of Earth-mass planets.\n\nThe parameter space of radio astrometric searches provides greater sensitivity to planets at larger radii than radial velocity searches. The fact that the VLBA and expanded VLBA are ideal for regions that can not be examined efficiently through the radial velocity method, coronagraphy or optical interferometry makes radio astrometry a unique and vital tool in the roadmap for exoplanet discovery and characterization."}
{"text":"\nResearch on the possibility of invisibility cloaks for electromagnetic fields has revealed new opportunities for hiding objects from electromagnetic wave detection. This paper examines the potentiality of transforming materials into cloaking structures using singular coordinate transformation with different permittivity and permeability tensors. A rigorous time-domain analysis with Maxwell's equations expressed in Schr\u00f6dinger's form is conducted to outline the mathematical conditions surrounding the singular media. This allows for a clear interpretation of the self-adjoint maximum electromagnetic propagator, crafted by unitary equivalence. The transformation ball of the cloaked object remains unchanged and the scattering operator is thus preserved for general anisotropic materials. Our results provide an evidence of a successful cloaking process that works for both passive and active electromagnetic shields."}
{"text":"\nThis study presents an analysis of a 1.5 square degree region of the Serpens Dark Cloud through maps at 24, 70, and 160 microns from the Spitzer Space Telescope MIPS camera, from which 2400, 100 and 4 sources were respectively identified. Probing Monte Carlo simulations, completeness limits for the 24 micron survey were estimated, and source counts, colors and magnitudes were compared with two reference data sets. Results of this analysis identified a population of young stellar objects that is distinct from these reference sets, in addition to showing a correlation between visual extinction and dust emission. The embedded YSO candidates found were located in the regions of highest visual extinction."}
{"text":"\nThis study presents findings from a high-resolution, dissipationless cosmological\nsimulation of a flat LCDM universe in order to examine the implications of\nrealistic galaxies on the three-point correlation function (3PCF).

These findings were consistent with recent measurements of the 3PCF\nfrom the SDSS and 2dFGRS and showed that binning choices may be a factor in\ndiscrepancies between measurements. As well, our results demonstrated that a\nlocal bias model was capable of approximating the 3PCF accurately.

{"text":"This paper reviews the analytical models and numerical approaches used to understand the formation and ensuing collisional changes of Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs) located in the range of 20 to 150 astronomical units (AU). It provides an assessment of the fundamental self-stirring model and how deviation occur through flyby or giant planet stirring. Though genuine comparison between the outcome of these studies and data from observations require more comprehensive analysis, the evidence supports KBO creation from a massive disk and following development accounts for significant collisional erosion and dynamical rejection. Nevertheless, a compatibility between the results of combining colliding and dynamical analysis is challenging to realize. This refers to distinctions between the present comprehension of KBO and asteroid development and advocates for more distinct families of KBO, like 2003 EL61 family, to acquire extra understanding into the contribution of collisional abrasion and dynamical rejection in the Kuiper Belt. This research sparks the absolute need for the development of a consolidated calculation, combining both the collisional and dynamical evolution in order to gain a better insight regarding KBO formation and evolution."}
{"text":"\nBy combining the late-breaking technology of numerical simulations with the latest observational datasets, we analyze the merging galaxy cluster 1E 0657-5 with a specific focus on the self-interaction cross-section of dark matter, sigma\/m. The X-ray observations of 1E0657-56 reveal a bullet-like subcluster embedded in a bow shock, while the lensing results imply that the mass peaks and collisionless galaxy locations closely coincide. To further constrain sigma\/m, we run N-body simulations which account for self-interacting dark matter, and then compare the results with observations. This newfound approach enables an independent upper limit (68% confidence) of sigma\/m < 1.25 cm^2\/g, which lowers the range found in previous, simpler analytic estimates of 0.5-5 cm^2\/g. Moreover, assuming that the subcluster and main cluster had similar mass-to-light ratios prior to their merger, the non-observation of an offset between the subcluster's mass peak and galaxy centroid can produce a limit of sigma\/m < 0.7 cm^2\/g. Altogether, this imposes a stringent constraint on the self-interaction cross-section of dark matter, blocking off any theoretical discrepancies between the standard cold dark matter model and observational data."}
{"text":"This paper presents near-infrared and optical multi-band observations of the BL Lac object PKS2155-304 from May to December 2005. Systematically monitored with the 60 cm robotic telescope REM at La Silla, Chile, the source was observed to vary over months, days and hours. The VRIJHK filters were utilized with a set of photometric points and a shorter integration time which are superior to previous observations. The intensity and colors, corresponding to three different states, were distinguished and the highest state ever detected was noted in the H band. Fluctuation of up to a factor of 4 was noted in the H band, while the V band showed a factor of 2. Moreover, the source softened as the intensity increased, contrarily to the pattern seen in UV-X-ray bands. Overnight monitoring of 5 nights in November observed a variability episode of around 24 hours as well as a more rapid flare with 1-2 hour timescale, though a limited number of photometric points were recorded."}
{"text":"\nWe have obtained broadband near-infrared (NIR) spectra of A0620-00 using the SpeX instrument on the Infrared Telescope Facility. The spectrum reveals a blue continuum with broad emission lines of hydrogen and helium, and narrower absorption lines of neutral metals and molecules. Comparison with scaled spectral type standard stars shows that the donor star has to be later than K3V, while its contribution to the NIR flux is determined to be 82+-2%. These observations, taken in conjunction with data from Froning & Robinson (2001) and Marsh et al. (1994), allow us to accurately calculate the black hole mass of A0620-00 as 9.7+-0.6 solar masses. Furthermore, signs of lower carbon abundance in A0620-00 compared to field dwarf stars are indicated by the observed CO absorption features."}
{"text":"\nA multiwavelength monitoring campaign was carried out to investigate the spectral energy distribution (SED) and optical spectral variability of the BL Lac object 3C 66A over the time period of July 2003 to April 2004. Using time-dependent leptonic jet model simulations, the SED and optical light curves of 3C 66A were effectively reproduced and the presence of an intrinsic cutoff value at ~ 4 GeV determined. Additionally, the results suggest that there is negligible influence the optical depth of the intergalactic infrared background radiation (IIBR) has on the peak of the high-energy component. Furthermore, it is likely that the broad line region (BLR) contributes to the hard X-ray and gamma-ray emission when the emission region is near to the central engine. Lastly, the predicted X-ray spectral variability and lack of a hysteresis pattern in the optical and soft X-ray regimes for major flares on multi-day time scales was discussed."}
{"text":"This study investigates the planet-finding program around very-low-mass stars using GJ 674, an M2.5 dwarf located at d=4.5 pc. Intense observations revealed two superimposed coherent signals with a 4.69-day signal caused by GJ 674b, a Neptune-mass planet, and a 35-day signal originating from a stellar rotation period-induced spot inhomogeneity. This adds to the growing number of Neptune-mass planets around M-dwarfs and reinforces the conclusion that this mass domain is more populated compared to the jovian mass range. An analysis of the metallicity distributions of M dwarf with and without planets shows a low 11% probability of them coming from the same parent distribution and gives tentative evidence that the host star metallicity correlates with the total mass of the planetary system."}
{"text":"\nThis paper presents the results of an observation of the L1204 dust cloud using the Onsala 25-m telescope in the 6 cm (1$_{11}-1_{10}$) transition of \\htco. We detect the spectral line in absorption against the background Cosmic Microwave Radiation, implying that a wide spread of warm molecular gas is present at mid-level densities. A comparison of the H$_2$CO and CO (1-0) emission reveals that, while the overall distributions are alike, there are considerable discrepancies at the granular level. Particularly, the S140 H${\\alpha}$ arc peak is nearly coincident with the CO, however, the H$_2$CO absorption maximum is 10$'$ (approx. 3 pc) away. It is hypothesized that this is due to the fact that \\htco\\ is easily photodissociated and therefore is a weaker marker of the molecular gas just behind Photon Dominated Regions. Consequently, the CO is more saturated and better suited for highlighting warm gas."}
{"text":"\nThis article investigates common envelope evolution, an astrophysical process that occurs when the envelope of a donor star envelops a much denser companion. As proposed by Paczynski and Ostriker, this mass exchange creates short-period binary systems with degenerate components. Reconstructing the evolutionary histories of close double white dwarf systems has been more challenging, as it is likely that enhanced systemic mass loss is needed. The presence of long-period interacting binaries and recurrent novae, such as T CrB and RS Oph, suggests that the energy budget for common envelope evolution may be incomplete. Recombination energy could potentially satisfy the missing energy term and serve to resolve this issue. The research discussed in this article critiques and refines the theoretical formulation of common envelope evolution and the energy budget to account for the complexities of the process."}
{"text":"This study focuses on the exploration of epitaxial graphene grown on single crystal silicon carbide. It has been found that the first layer of graphene is electrically-doped, while the other layers remain largely non-doped. Examining its transport characteristics, Dirac particle properties (i.e. anomalous Berry's phase, weak anti-localization, and square root relationship of Landau level energies) are apparent, along with quasi-ballistic transport and long coherence lengths that may persist at temperatures higher than cryogenic. It appears that, in contrast to its exfoliated counterpart, the quantum Hall effect is not observed in this high mobility form of graphene due to a lack of localized states. Aside from its electrical characteristics, epitaxial graphene has been determined to be compatible with lithographic patterning and evaluation with a range of methods, making it a potentially viable option for room-temperature ballistic devices able to provide low-dissipation ultrafast nanoelectronics."}
{"text":"\nDuring this research, N-body models that contain up to 100000 stars were employed to study primordial binary fractions. In these models, primordial binary frequencies ranged from 5% to 50%. By using the NBODY4 code to simulate these star clusters, full mass spectrums, stellar evolution, binary evolution, and the tidal field of the Galaxy are included. The results show that on the whole, the binary fraction of the cluster often stays close to the primordial value. However, the core binary frequency remarkably increases over time, reaching up the 40% with only 20000 stars remaining after 16 Gyr at the end of the core-collapse phase, beginning with 100000 stars and 5% binaries. The rise in binary numbers is thanks to both mass-segregation and the formation of new binaries via various exchange interactions. In addition, we notice binary cycling behaviour in cluster cores comparable to convection in stars. Model simulations of 100000 stars exhibit that the evolution of the core-radius until the core-collapse phase is not altered significantly regardless of the initial binary frequency (which is 10% or below). The impacts of these findings on the possible binary content of globular clusters are discussed."}
{"text":"\nAn algorithm for seedless cones has been proposed to provide infrared (IR) safety in hadron collider experiments. This approach is different to existing cone jet algorithms which use event particles as seeds in an iterative search. However, the time required to find jets among N particles by the only existing approach takes N 2^N time, making it unfeasible at hadron level. Therefore, this paper proposes an exact seedless cone algorithm that reduces the time to N^2 ln(N) to make it feasible for hadron colliders. In addition, Monte Carlo tests provide strong support for the analytic proof of IR safety of the new algorithm, and demonstrate a good practical correspondence between the parton and hadron levels. For inclusive jet spectra, the use of an IR safe seedless algorithm mostly alters the underlying event sensitivity but has a significant effect on some multi-jet observables."}
{"text":"This paper considers the nature of isospin breaking in charged-to-neutral yield ratios for $B {\\bar B}$ and $D {\\bar D}$ pairs near their respective thresholds in $e^+e^-$ annihilation. The realistic model includes a resonant interaction in the isospin I=0 channel and a non-resonant strong scattering amplitude in the I=1 state, offering a smooth dependence on the scattering phase in the I=1 channel. It also extends to $K {\\bar K}$ production at the $\\phi(1020)$ resonance, with the Coulomb effect in the yield ratio being sensitive to scattering phases in both the isoscalar and isovector channels. The model is also used to study the effect of the isotopic mass difference between the charged and neutral mesons, with strong scatter effects potentially providing a modification to the kinematical effects of the mass difference."}

This result generalizes upper bounds determined by \\cite{BV} for semi-algebraic and semi-Pfaffian families. Additionally, the article presents a topological comparison theorem which may be of independent use in the study of arrangements. "}
{"text":"\nThis paper outlines a generalized twistor transform for spinning particles in 3+1 dimensions that can describe and predict infinite duality relationships among spinning systems with different Hamiltonians beyond the known free and massless cases. Using 2T-physics in 4+2 dimensions new properties of twistors are uncovered to construct a unified description of spinning particles. The fundamental underlying symmetry of SU(2,3), which includes conformal symmetry SU(2,2)=SO(4,2) in the massless case, is presented and may have potential implications in new forms of string theory background, as well as pave a new path to studying several aspects of M theory. Further details are provided in the companion paper."}
{"text":"\nThis research analyses the development of a 0.9Msun and 0.6Msun Carbon-Oxygen (CO) white dwarf merger by the use of a three-dimensional Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) simulation. By not relying heavily on artificial viscosity, a larger particle number was used which points toward a slowly rotating cold core and a rapidly rotating hot envelope surrounding a disc under the influence of centrifugal force as the possible quasi-static equilibrium result of the merger remnant. Subsequently, the evolution of the remnant was studied with a one-dimensional hydrodynamic stellar evolution code and it was found that neutrino cooling is required to stabilise the cold core while avoiding carbon nucleosynthesis. This provides evidence that the assumed artificial accretion of cold matter to the remnants of a CO white dwarf merger may not be necessary, thus making them potential progenitors of Type Ia supernovae with a characteristic time delay of about 105 years post-dynamical merger."}
{"text":"\nWe examine the weak field, post-Newtonian expansion of Chern-Simons gravity, allowing interactions with a perfect fluid source. In particular, we analyze the mapping of this solution to the Parameterized Post-Newtonian (PPN) formalism to 1 PN order on the metric. Our results demonstrate that the PPN parameters of Chern-Simons gravity are identical to those of general relativity, with the exception of a new term introduced by the Chern-Simons coupling parameter and the curl of the PPN vector potentials. This new term is further enhanced by the nonlinearity of spacetime. Connecting this correction to the gravito-electromagnetic framework, we explore how it modifies the acceleration of point particles and the frame dragging effect in gyroscopic precession. Our findings suggest that modern and future experiments have the capability to detect these corrections and, as a result, place constraints on intrinsic Chern-Simons parameters and string theory."}
{"text":"This article explores the Spline Single-Index Prediction (SIP) Model, a robust, special case of projection pursuit regression, as an effective way of addressing the high-dimensional problem in nonparametric regression. Through simulations, this paper offers evidence that a polynomial spline estimator for SIP coefficients is both root-n consistent and asymptotically normal. An iterative optimization routine is also proposed to efficiently analyze large data of high dimension in a short amount of time. The SIP model produces superior out-of-sample results and is demonstrated using river flow data from Iceland."}
{"text":"\nAt the Pierre Auger Observatory in Malargue, Argentina, the Aerosol Phase Function (APF) system which measures the probability of light scattered in a given direction is regularly measured on an hourly basis. In order to accurately determine the energy of ultra-high energy cosmic rays, the APF system directs a UV light beam across the field of view of fluorescence detectors. Results from the light shots imaged in the fluorescence detector cameras are then used as input data to establish and define the atmospheric effects, including the aerosol attenuation length and the aerosol phase function. This article provides details of the design, standard operation practice and performance of the APF system at the Pierre Auger Observatory."}
{"text":"\nA study of the pre-main-sequence binary star UZ Tau E reveals evidence for periodic accretion from a circumbinary disk. Measurements of long-term photometric brightness, refined from new and existing radial velocity data, demonstrate that the binary period of 19.13 days is reflected in a broad peak of enhanced brightness observed over the course of more than half the binary orbital period. These observations are consistent with simulations of similar binaries and suggest that periodic accretion from the outer disk across the central gap can replenish the inner disks and potentially extend the timescale for planet formation."}

{"text":"\nWe conducted VLBI observations of 19 GPS radio sources to gain insights into the structures and components of the AGNs. 15 sources were from the Parkes Half Jansky sample, and 4 from an earlier observational list. At 1.6GHz, 17 sources were observed for the first time, with the majority showing a mini-double-lobe (CSO) structure, hinting that the host AGNs could be oriented towards us edgewise. 6 sources, identified with redshifts, revealed double-lobe structures with sizes of less than 1 kpc, classifying them as CSOs. 3 other sources were found to be core-jet sources based on their flux variability and morphologies. The study thus provides new evidence to suggest that there exists a high incidence of mini-double lobe radiosources in the PHJ sample."}
{"text":"Based on the data from the Millennium Galaxy Catalogue, this study provides an in-depth evaluation of the local supermassive black hole mass function in both early- and late-type galaxies. We use a Schechter function to parameterise the black hole mass function, with a low-mass end logarithmic slope (1+alpha) of ~0.7 for the full galaxy sample and ~1.0 for the early-type galaxies. Integrating the estimates from 10,000 galaxies (brighter than M_B = -18 mag) down to black hole masses of 10^6 M_sun, we estimate a local mass density of supermassive black holes as 3.5+\/-1.2 x 10^5 h^3_{70} M_sun Mpc^{-3} in early-type galaxies, and 1.0+\/-0.5 x 10^5 h^3_{70} M_sun Mpc^{-3} in late-type galaxies. The cosmological supermassive black hole mass density is thus computed to be 3.2+\/-1.2 x 10^{-6} h_70, indicating that around 0.007+\/-0.003 h^3_{70} per cent of the universe's baryons are locked into these objects."}
{"text":"\nThe propagation of pions in asymmetric nuclear matter (ANM) is studied in this article.  We consider two approaches: a non-chiral model where the pseudoscalar\/pseudovector coupling is determined using non-linear field transformations, and a chiral effective Lagrangian incorporating the short-distance behaviors known as the Dirac vacuum.  In both cases, the consequences from these approaches on the mode splitting of the charged pions are evaluated.  Using a hard nucleon loop approximation, accompanied by parameters deduced from a density expansion, closed-form analytical results for the effective pion masses and dispersion relations are presented in comparison to calculations for symmetric nuclear matter."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate a technique to fabricate half-metallicity in a ferromagnetic material by substituting Ti at the Ru-sites in SrRuO3, which is a known ferromagnetic material. By employing full potential linearized augmented plane wave method, we find that Ti4+ valence states, similar to SrTiO3, are obtained. Significant band narrowing is shown as a result of this Ti substitution, leading to a finite gap between the t2g and eg bands. When 75% substitution is done, a large gap (larger than 2 eV) is formed at the Fermi level in the spin density of states of the up spin electrons, while the spin density of states of the down spin electrons contribute at the Fermi level, thus characterizing the system a half-metallic ferromagnet. This study provides a simple and effective way to fabricate half-metallicity in ferromagnetic materials, which is important for developing spin-based technologies."}
{"text":"This paper investigates the emergence of spatiotemporal chaos driven by far-field breakup of spiral waves in a reaction-diffusion plankton model. Through computer simulations and theoretical analysis, the authors show that this model can exhibit both regular and chaotic behavior, as well as spatiotemporal patterns, in the case of mixed Turing-Hopf bifurcation. The results suggest that spatiotemporal chaos arising from the far-field breakup of spiral waves does not involve the entire region, and confirm this notion by means of computation spectra and nonlinear bifurcation of wave trains. Finally, explanations for the spatially structured patterns from a community level are also given."}
{"text":"\nThis article focuses on the pseudospectrum of elliptic quadratic differential operators. We investigate their spectral stability when perturbed with small variations and describe a necessary and sufficient condition for the Weyl symbol of these operators to ensure the stability of their spectra. In cases when the condition is violated, our work determines large parts within the pseudospectrum exhibiting significant instability in comparison to their spectra. We provide a comprehensive description of the spectrum of these operators, supported by evidence from numerical simulations of their false eigenvalues."}
{"text":"\nThis paper explores the concept of generalised entropies, beyond Shannon entropy, and aims to examine the implications of the recursivity postulate for these different forms of entropy. It looks at how the accumulative, logarithmic updates to Shannon entropy due to the postulate enable it to generate an additivity in situations of product probability. Other forms of generalised entropies, such as Mathai's entropy, are examined in relation to the impact on statistical mechanics and the development of pathways, exponential and power law behaviours and associated differential equations. Additionally, the paper explores the connections between Mathai's entropy and Kerridge's measure of inaccuracy."}
{"text":"This article explores methods for finding solutions to fractional reaction-diffusion equations utilising Laplace and Fourier transforms and the H-function. These solutions encompass previous research conducted by Mainardi et al. (2001, 2005) and Saxena et al. (2006a, b). Moreover, the advantage of utilising a Riesz-Feller derivative can be seen in the obtainment of solutions which incorporate a fundamental space-time fractional diffusion, as well as generalised neutral fractional, space-fractional and time-fractional diffusion. These types of diffusion can be interpreted as shifting spatial probability densities and can be expressed in terms of the H-function succinctly."}
{"text":"\nIn this paper, the authors investigate the effect of introducing a fifth large-scale space-time dimension to the fundamental laws of physics. Using the same framework from their previous study, the conservation of energy principle is taken into consideration. Results show that the inverse square law could be attributed to the conservation of energy at the boundary of a four-dimensional universe and a fifth dimesnion. Furthermore, a limiting case for the Tulley-Fisher relationship between the speed of light and the mass of the universe is also suggested. These findings were derived from cosmological constants and parameters, such as the gravitational constant, G, without referring to orbital dynamics. Additionally, a value for a acceleration parameter, ar, was estimated which plays a pivotal role in the new equations of dynamics."}
{"text":"\nThis paper introduces a novel multiphilic descriptor based on the local philicity concept of Chattaraj et al. and the two descriptors formulated by Toro-Labbe and compatriots. The multiphilic descriptor is the difference of nucleophilic (Wk+) and electrophilic (Wk-) condensed philicity functions, which makes it possible to explain the nucleophilicity and electrophilicity of an atomic site in a molecule simultaneously. We examine its predictive capabilities on the selected systems and their reactions, as well as the appropriate force profiles, by utilizing the nucleophilicity excess (DelW-+) towards nucleophiles over electrophilicity on all-metal aromatic compounds."}
{"text":"\nThe interactions between the components in lubricants containing zinc dialkyldithiophosphate (ZDTP) and\/or molybdenum dialkyldithiocarbamate (MoDTC) that create anti-wear films were evaluated using dynamic nanoindentation and friction tests in the nanometer scale. Results showed that a low friction coefficient (0.01 < $\\mu$ < 0.05) is obtained when the two additives are present. This is due to the favourable configuration of MoS2 planes sliding over each other when the pressure is sufficiently high, which is enabled by the presence of ZDTP. Through nanoindentation experiments and a simple stiffness measurement model, the layered structure and rheological properties can also be observed."}
{"text":"\nThis article investigates the development and implementation of a lattice Boltzmann (LB) inverse kinetic approach for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. This inverse kinetic theory serves the purpose of constructing a discrete kinetic theory that yields exact fluid equations, which is non-asymptotic in nature. Possible realizations of the theory are provided through asymptotic approximations, enabling the calculation of fluid equations with a prescribed accuracy. As a result, the accuracy of customary LB approaches and comparisons with the Chorin artificial compressibility method are discussed."}
{"text":"\nThis article investigates how phonons affect the transitions of atoms between different translational levels in a potential generated by a surface. Using the Debye model, we come up with equations for computation of therates of both upward and downward transitions. As an example, we take deep silica-induced potential to analyze the bound and free states of cesium atoms. Results show that the main contribution to absorption rate is from transitions between deep bound levels and transitions to free states for shallow bound levels. Furthermore, for deep bound levels, phonon emission and absorption processes are much more significant than for shallow ones. Lastly, when cesium atoms in the range between 100 \u03bcK and 400 \u03bcK near a silica surface with a temperature of 300 K, atoms will more likely be absorbed than heated, while cooling processes are insignificant."}
{"text":"\nUsing the Suzaku XIS CCD camera, scientists were able to observe the diffuse X-ray \nemission from the Carina nebula with very high spectral resolution. The extended emission was observed from the core\nand the eastern side of the nebula with the lines of iron and silicon ions. An absorbed thin-thermal plasma model showed \nsimilar results where the plasma temperature was determined at 0.2 and 0.6 keV and the NH was between 1-2e21 cm-2. Also, \nit was found that the abundance of oxygen, magnesium, silicon and iron varied by a factor of 2-3. Researchers have suggested\nthat this plasma might have gushed out from an old supernova or a super shell of multiple supernovae."}
{"text":"\nWe present the findings for a visible spectroscopic and photometric examination of Jupiter Trojans associated with different dynamical families conducted at the ESO-NTT telescope. The survey includes data on 47 objects - 23 in the L5 swarm and 24 in the L4 swarm - in addition to already published Fornasier et al. (2004a) and Dotto et al. (2006) survey data, giving a total of 80 surveyed objects. Our sample reflects a dominance of D-type asteroids, with the exception of the Eurybates family in the L4 swarm which consists mostly of C- and P-type asteroids. Some Eurybates members were identified as having a dropoff in reflectance shortward of 5200A, a phenomenon seen in main belt C-type asteroids and attributed to the intervalence charge transfer transition in oxidized iron. The sample was found to include fainter and smaller Trojans and enabled the investigation of asteroids with diameters of 40-50km and less. The analysis of spectral slopes, colors and diameters showed no difference between blue and red objects. A statistical evaluation of the distributions based on the Trojans' physical and orbital parameters was conducted, as well as a comparison to other classes of minor bodies in the outer Solar System. The results revealed that Trojans at lower inclinations tend to be bluer than those at higher inclinations, mainly due to the dominance of the Eurybates family."}
{"text":"\nThis study investigated a sample of ten FIRST-based compact steep spectrum (CSS) sources, making use of multifrequency Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) observations at 1.7, 5 and 8.4 GHz as well as unpublished 8.4GHz Very Large Array (VLA) images of five sources. The purpose was to examine their morphological characteristics on milliarcsecond scales in order to evaluate whether they could be relics of early-stage radio-loud AGNs or indicators of intermittent activity. The resulting maps suggest a complex radio past in some cases, possibly due to intense activity that outputs into multiple directions. The prominent example of this is 1045+352, a young CSS object whose powerful synchrotron emission is also seen in the infrared in the form of a broad absorption line (BAL) quasar. Its asymmetric two-sided morphology may suggest episodes of intermittent activity, which are consistent with the evolutionary hardening of BAL quasars. It has also been confirmed that the submillimetre flux of 1045+352 is largely composed of synchrotron emission."}
{"text":"\nUsing the mechanical method of Abrikosov vortex stimulated dynamics (ASD), investigations of high-temperature superconductor HoBa2Cu3O7-d were conducted to examine the effects of pulsed magnetic fields on relaxation phenomena existing in the vortex matter. It was determined that different pulse durations and amplitudes bring about threshold phenomena, which greatly alter the processes of relaxation. Low duration pulses have no impact on them, however when the duration exceeds a certain threshold, the relaxation process experiences a discrete change in the mechanical force. Studies further revealed that the time taken to form an Abrikosov vortex lattice in HoBa2Cu3O7-d is approximately twenty microseconds; this is much higher than the time needed to form a single vortex in type II superconductors."}
{"text":"\nWe present a collection of trigonometric parallax measurements for 15 halo white dwarf (WD) candidates from Oppenheimer et al. (2001). The stars were observed from August 2001 to July 2004 using the ESO 1.56-m Danish Telescope and ESO 2.2-m telescope. Parallaxes for 6 objects had a relative error of ~5%, 3 objects had a relative error of ~12%, and two more objects had a relative error of ~20%. Our data set provides reliable estimates of distance, absolute magnitude and revised space velocities for the 15 halo WDs. It was determined that 6 of them are unambiguous halo members, 5 may be thick disk members, and 4 were too distant to draw any conclusions. Furthermore, our trigonometric parallaxes were compared to photometric parallaxes used in previous studies and showed an overestimation of distances with photometric techniques. This information can be used to revise the halo white dwarf space density, and the analysis of this will be presented in a future paper."}
{"text":"\nIn this study we explore the evolution of low T\/|W| bar-mode instabilities of neutron stars via a suite of numerical simulations adapted to use an adaptive mesh refinement hydrodynamics code. Results show that when rapid differential rotation is present, the star is unstable against bar-mode deformation even at very small values of the ratio of rotational kinetic energy to gravitational potential energy. Our high-resolution simulations have enabled us to reveal complex fluid motion and morphological features present during the instability, including the excitation of Kelvin-Helmholtz-like modes outside the corotation radius. We have also observed resolution-dependent behaviour in the long-term, nonlinear evolution of the bar-mode instability. This could have important implications for the dynamics of rotating stars, and consequently for the amplitude of the associated gravitational wave signals."}
{"text":"In this article, we explore the dynamics of evolutionary games on populations that possess a minimal structure consisting of two distinct hierarchical levels of interaction. Using a combination of stochastic processes at the individual level and two successive meanfield approximations, we derive the dynamics governing this system. We then analyze this model in the context of both the repeated prisoner's dilemma and the rock-paper-scissors game. Our research reveals a variety of outcomes and dynamics, including counterintuitive mechanisms by which cooperation may be sustained despite a constant influx of defectors and the emergence of global oscillations. These findings indicate that population structure, even when simple and minimally structured, can have a significant effect on the dynamics and outcomes of evolutionary games."}
{"text":"\nThis article investigates the influence of an uneven mass distribution in coronal loops on the frequencies and wave patterns of torsional Alfven oscillations. After deriving the oscillations' dispersion equations in rough and intense inhomogeneity limits, the accuracy of the equations is verified through numerical solutions. We discover that the uneven mass distribution decreases the wave frequency of torsional oscillations in relation to the frequency using the mass density value from the loop summit. This frequency reduction occurs due to the decrease of the average Alfven speed in denser loops at the footpoints. These derived dispersion equations and wave patterns appeal to potential observations of torsional oscillations, which create periodic variance in spectral line widths. Therefore, torsional oscillations are an effective means of developing coronal seismology."}
{"text":"\nIn this work, we put forth and investigate a family of partially systematic parallel concatenated convolutional codes (PCCCs) denoted as pseudo-randomly punctured codes, which have a rate of 1\/2. We compare this code family to their rate-1\/3 parent codes, in terms of their bit error rate performance. Our findings indicate that the rate-1\/2 codes provided better error floor performance, owing to the moderate puncturing of their systematic output. Additionally, we observe that pseudo-random puncturing serves as an effective strategy to simultaneously improve the bandwidth efficiency and reduce the error floor of codes. In conclusion, we propose pseudo-random puncturing as a viable means for ameliorating the performance of PCCCs."}
{"text":"\nTo explore the relationship between the metal-insulator transition in the quasi-one-dimensional organic conductor (TMTSF)2FSO3 and infrared microspectroscopy, we have studied the optical conductivity spectra of the material along the axes of (E||a) and (E||b') as a function of temperature. We found that once the anion ordering-related metal-insulator transition occurred, a Drude-like response occurred in the spectra, and a noticeable energy gap of roughly 185 meV (1500 cm-1) emerged. Moreover, we discovered a new infrared mode in the vicinity of 710 cm-1 which produced a peculiar temperature-dependent behaviour. To understand this, a model based on TMTSF molecule vibration and the reorientation of the FSO3 anion electrical dipole moment was devised."}
{"text":"\nThis paper dives into the analysis of the momentum operator expression in relation to the spherical polar coordinates and its implications in the field of quantum mechanics. We identify the difficulty encountered when the said operator is translated in the same way as prescribed by its Cartesian form. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the momentum expectation value works in varying bound states and further explain the consequence of its real form. In addition, we also discuss the role of angular variables in quantum mechanics, considering any related issues and interpretation. To wrap this up, we give the example of the hydrogen atom's momentum equation and provide our insights."}
{"text":"\nThis study examines the formation and consumption of the rich methane laminar flame structures when doped with the light unsaturated hydrocarbons allene and propyne. The experiments conducted under pressure of 6.7 kPa and a gas temperature range from 333 K up to 1850 K reveal the concentration profiles of several detectable stable species. To enable reliable modelling, a mechanism has been developed in the laboratory in regards to reactions of C3-C4 unsaturated hydrocarbons, with the key reaction pathways of consumption of allene and propyne, as well as production of C6 aromatic species being taken into account. The analysis involves supplied amounts of 20.9% (molar) of methane, 33.4% oxygen and 2.49% C3H4 respectively, with their equivalence ratio standing at 1.25 and 1.55, respectively."}
{"text":"\nThis study examines the long-term behavior of a type of branching diffusion in its high temperature phase. We provide a two-step mechanism for how the particle system grows in space and type dimensions, with growth rates of requiring particles near $-\\gamma t$ and type positions near $\\kappa \\sqrt{t}$ for high times $t$. We utilized martingale techniques for this purpose, particularly an additive martingale with a change of measure. Our work not only provides new insight into this diffusion type, it may also lead to strategies for applying similar techniques to other branching scenarios. Furthermore, the results may have connections to traveling wave solutions of a related reaction-diffusion equation."}
{"text":"This study examines clustering in light nuclei with initial energies of 1 A GeV or higher via nuclear track emulsion. Results of research into relativistic $^9$Be fragmentation in emulsion are found to indicate that angular measurements play a key role in recovering the excitation spectrum of the $\\alpha$-particle system. It has been observed that in peripheral interactions, $^9$Be nuclei dissociate essentially only through the 0$^+$ and 2$^+$ states of the $^8$Be nucleus. Measurements of the momentum and correlation characteristics of resulting $\\alpha$-particles for a $^{14}$N reaction of momentum 2.86 A GeV\/c in a laboratory system and the system of rest 3$\\alpha$-particles are also detailed.

{"text":"\nIn this article, we investigate the potential of the CNGS beam in determining the parameter space of a model containing a separate sterile neutrino with a mass-squared difference of $ \\mathcal{O}(\\eVq)$ from the three active neutrinos. We apply our analysis with the OPERA detector as the primary tool and it can be further improved by a specific simulation of ICARUS. Furthermore, $\\nu_\\mu \\to \\nu_\\tau$ oscillation has the most potential to restrict this sterile neutrino parameter space, due to its less restrictive present experiments and the very low backgrounds available in both OPERA and ICARUS detectors. Our study also factored in the $\\nu_\\mu \\to \\nu_e$ oscillations. The CNGS power to identify sterile neutrinos appear limited, but with 2 to 10 folds of the current neutrino flux, we can acquire more nuanced constraints on the four-neutrino parameter space. Additionally, the bound on $\\theta_{13}$ that can be elicited from the CNGS is all unaffected by potential sterile neutrinos."}
{"text":"\nThis article examines how the mass quadrupole moment of a black hole affects the Carter constant during inspiral. The Carter constant is the third in a set of three constants of the motion in the absence of radiation reaction. By analyzing the system to linear order in the mass quadrupole, we compute the instantaneous and time-averaged alteration of the three constants by radiation reaction. After combining this with a quadratic spin interaction, we observe the effect of the black hole quadrupole on eccentric orbits, namely circularization and the alignment of the orbital plane with the symmetry axis of the black hole. Lastly, we investigate the possibility of an analogous Carter constant for a system of two point masses, one with a single mass or current multipole. Our results indicate that such a constant of geodesic motion does not exist except in certain cases with spin or mass quadrupole."}
{"text":"\nThis study analyzed the effect of removing cortical nodes and connections on the structural properties of networks in the cat and macaque brains. We investigated network decay, measured the other set of properties (such as topology, hodology, clustering, and hierarchical organization), and looked at the similarities between cortical network decay and scale-free networks. We found that the most prominent hubs and bottleneck connections contributed to the conditional robustness of these brain networks. Our results therefore provide additional insight into the development of brain connectivity and the functional and structural implications of the networks."}

{"text":"\nThis study applied the Relativistic Transport Model (ART1.0) to analyze the stopping effects of tip-tip and body-body U+U collisions at a beam kinetic energy of 520 MeV\/nucleon. It was found that both of these two extreme orientations of collisions could achieve full stopping and form a large, hot, and dense volume of nuclear matter for a long duration. Furthermore, the level of nucleon sideward flow in tip-tip collisions was revealed to be nearly 3 times that in body-body collisions, with $b\/b_{max}<0.5$. Additionally, body-body central collisions displayed the most negative value of nucleon elliptic flow at $v_2=-12$%, as opposed to no impact in tip-tip collisions. These results suggest that tip-tip and body-body collisions offer a great condition and sensitive probe to examine the nuclear equation of state (EoS) separately. To this end, the Cooling Storage Ring (CSR) External Target Facility (ETF) located in Lanzhou, China, is anticipated to deliver uranium projectiles of up to 520 MeV\/nucleon, which could potentially provide significant advancement to research the nuclear equation of state."}
{"text":"\nThis article focuses on the star formation taking place within the dusty region of the Bok globule CB54. Mid-infrared imaging provides evidence of the protostellar status of the near-infrared source CB54YC1-II, consisting of a central source mass of roughly 0.8 solar masses, and a mid-infrared luminosity of 8 solar masses. In addition, three new mid-infrared sources were located that are coincident with a previously known, dense cloud core and likely correspond to embedded class 0 protostars. Temperature analysis of the mid-infrared sources indicates temperatures of around 100K, providing further evidence of their protostellar status. Moreover, observations of the near-infrared source CB54YC1-I gives insight towards its possible status, being either a highly extinguished young star or a background giant."}
{"text":"In this article, we explore the Weyl type classifications of static, stationary, and warped product spacetimes in higher dimensions in relation to Einstein spacetimes. For a vacuum spacetime, we distinguish between those that can be categorized as type D and those that cannot. We demonstrate that for most of these cases, the principal null directions are geodetic, regardless of the dimension. Furthermore, in the event that the twistfree condition is not met, we provide examples of spacetimes in any dimension n\u22657 that have non-geodetic multiple principal null directions. Finally, the examples of the Myers-Perry black hole and Kerr-NUT-AdS metrics in five dimensions are explored to illustrate the properties of type D vacuum spacetimes."}
{"text":"\nThis study examines the nearby young G-type dwarf star HD 70573, located at a distance of 46 pc and estimated to be between 20 and 300 million years old. FEROS spectroscopy at the 2.2 m MPG\/ESO telescope at La Silla provided a spectral type of G1-1.5V and an estimated age of 100 million years. The star was monitored for radial velocity variations from December 2003 to January 2007, with a velocity accuracy of 10 m\/s. An observed period of 852 +\/- 12 days and a semi-amplitude of 149 +\/- 6 m\/s were determined. This period is significantly longer than the star's rotational period of 3.3 days, dismissing rotation and non-radial pulsations as the source of the velocity variation. The presence of a low-mass companion around the star, estimated to have a minimum mass of 6.1 Mjup and an orbital semi-major axis of 1.76 AU and eccentricity of e=0.4, provides the best explanation for the observed radial velocity variation. This discovery of a planet orbiting a young star is a valuable insight into the relationship between debris disks around young stars and their connection to planetary formation."}
{"text":"  This article expands upon the research presented in a previous paper on how precise geometrical engineering can be used to reduce the complexity of grand unified models. Through top-down unfolding and specifically tuning the singularities which generate the 'low energy' matter fields, the arbitrariness of geometrical engineering models can be significantly diminished. This paper demonstrates how the Standard Model's three families are a result of the unfolding of a singularity of E8, and how an SO(10)'s sixteen representations can be converted into the ones found in the Standard Model."}
{"text":"\nThis paper reports the results of a 30 ks observation of the black hole candidate Cygnus X-1 using the High Energy Transmission Grating Spectrometer (HETGS) on the {\\em Chandra X-ray Observatory}. Detectable absorption lines were identified in the HETGS spectrum and were associated with highly ionized Ne, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, and Fe - some of which had been seen in earlier HETGS observations. While the overall X-ray flux of the source changed by only 20-30%, the most remarkable finding was dramatic variability of the lines over the duration of the observation. One such line, that of Ne X at 12.14 \\AA, went from a flux of $5 \\times 10^{-3}$ photons cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ in the beginning of the observation, to an undetectable (with a 99% upper limit of $0.06 \\times 10^{-3}$ photons cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$) level several hours later. This suggests a decrease of nearly two orders of magnitude over that period of time. Possible implications of this result are discussed."}
{"text":"\nA space-based gravitational microlensing survey could provide a statistical census of exoplanets from 0.1 Earth-masses in size and orbital separations from 0.5AU to infinity. This would include analogs to all Solar System planets except for Mercury, as well as the predicted planets from planet formation theories. This type of survey is capable of providing detailed estimates of the frequency of planets around all types of stars, including those with short lifetimes. Planets with orbital separations smaller then 0.5 AU would be invisible due to the limitations of a space-based microlensing survey, but these can be found by other methods such as the Kepler mission. Ground-based microlensing is limited to near the Einstein radius of 2-3AU, while space-based imaging is needed to identify and determine the mass of the host stars of most planets discovered by microlensing. Therefore a space-based microlensing survey is likely to be the only way to get a thorough understanding of planetary systems, which is critical in order to deduce planet formation and habitability. The proposed Microlensing Planet Finder mission is an example of a viable and cost-comfortable space-based microlensing survey."}
{"text":"\nWe present photometric, astrometric, and spectroscopic analysis of the possible triple system USCO160611.9-193532 AB, which has an unusually wide separation of approximately 1600 AU.  This system comprises two low-mass components (total mass of ~0.4 M_sun) that are associated with the nearby Upper Scorpius OB association. Our high-resolution observations suggest the primary be a close binary, further complicating the system. If confirmed, the triple system would represent a rare example of its kind. We also assess the likelihood of the system being physically associated by analysing the two-point correlation function of the association and find that 25% of Uppper Sco's low-mass members could be separated by 15\" or less in projection. Ultimately, a systematic search for additional wide systems is required to establish an accurate picture of the wide binary population in Upper Sco. Detection of another such pair would provide evidence of excess with 98% confidence."}
{"text":"\nWe present in this paper Faraday rotation measures (RMs) for 148 extragalactic\nsources situated behind the southern Galactic plane (253o < l < 356o, |b| < 1.5o). Through\nanalysis of our measurements together with previously published data, we have revealed strong associations between these RMs and the positions of the Galactic spiral arms. These connections imply the existence of at least one large-scale magnetic reversal in the fourth Galactic quadrant. We model the entire flux of available extragalactic and pulsar RMs in this region to gain further insights, elucidating that the magnetic field in the Sagittarius-Carina arm is directed clockwise while that of the Scutum-Crux arm is counter-clockwise. Our results differ from recent pulsar RM studies, as we do not require multiple large-scale magnetic field reversals."}
{"text":"\nThis paper presents a series of conclusions demonstrating how entanglement between two qubits can be increased or reduced by interactions on only one qubit, with the other qubit not being entangled or correlated with the third qubit (control). The state of the two entangled qubits can change from maximally entangled to separable and vice versa with the help of a swap operation between the qubits and the control, leading to compensating changes in the entanglement. When the entanglement increases, the map that describes the change in the state of the two qubits is not completely positive. Additionally, the paper explores how a combination of two independent interactions that cause an exponential decay of the entanglement can, instead, result in the entanglement reaching zero at a finite time."}
{"text":"\nUsing the SCUBA camera on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope, we detected dust emission at both 850 and 450 micron around the pre-main sequence M1 dwarf TWA 7. This discovery confirms the presence of a cold dust disk in TWA 7, a member of the TW Hydrae Association. With a mass opacity of 1.7 cm^2\/g and a temperature of 45 K, the estimated mass of the disk is 18 lunar masses (0.2 Earth masses), showing that TWA 7's disk is an order of magnitude more massive than the disk found around the closest (9.9 pc) debris disk discovered around an M dwarf (AU Microscopii, GL 803). Our analyses of the mid-IR and submillimeter data indicate that the disk consists of dust at a range of temperatures, but either a single radius from the star model or a uniform size, different temperature model may fit the emission spectrum of the disk. We further compared the characteristics of TWA 7's disk to known disks around low-mass stars in the TW Hydrae Association and observed no correlation between spectral type, mass or the evolutionary state of the disks (gas-rich or debris)."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate how X-ray spectra from accretion disks around black hole candidates can be used to measure the fundamental properties of the binary system. Focusing mainly on two XMM-Newton observations of GX 339-4, which provide high-quality data in low energy ranges, we attempt to determine the color correction factor to account for the deviation of the local disk spectrum from a blackbody. This factor cannot be calculated beforehand due to various parameters, so we propose modeling the disk spectra with saturated Compton scattering to obtain reasonable values. We compare this with other models, and demonstrate that the high-soft-state continuum cannot be accurately modeled by available disk models. Our work points to some intriguing conclusions."}
{"text":"\nThe problem of finding the maximum weighted edge biclique (MWEB), which searches for a bipartite subgraph with the highest possible sum of edge weights, has been extensively studied. This issue is of particular importance given its various applications in bioinformatics, machine learning, and databases. In this work, we prove that, except in the case of $\\mathsf{RP = NP}$, no polynomial-time algorithm can approximate the MWEB within a factor of $n^{\\epsilon}$ for some $\\epsilon > 0$ in certain settings, when the ratio between the minimum and maximum weights of the edges are in the $\\Omega(\\eta^{\\delta-1\/2}) \\cap O(\\eta^{1\/2-\\delta})$ range, i.e., for $\\eta = \\max\\{|V_1|, |V_2|\\}$, and $\\delta \\in (0,1\/2]$. To demonstrate this, we apply this proof to two algorithm problems: (1) discovering statistically significant biclustering in the SAMBA model proposed in \\cite{Tan02}, and (2) the Minimum Description Length with Holes problem \\cite{Bu05}\u2014both of which do not have any polynomial-time solutions unless $\\mathsf{RP=NP}$. These results additionally suggest that no good approximation algorithms are expected to exist, reinforcing the motivation for researchers to develop heuristic approaches to tackle these problems."}
{"text":"This study provides evidence that the soft-excess emission in the cluster of galaxies Sersic 159-03 can be attributed to a non-thermal source. Observations from XMM-Newton and Suzaku reveal a strong peak of the emission at the position of the central cD galaxy, and no substantial azimuthal variations in the emission. Analysis of the data obtained by the XMM-Newton Reflection Grating Spectrometers does not support the notion that the soft-excess is of thermal origin, but suggests a non-thermal interpretation. We theorize that the high density of relativistic electrons responsible for the peak of the emission in the cluster's centre could have been generated by an active galactic nucleus in the cD galaxy, or from diffuse shock acceleration."}
{"text":"\nUsing numerical simulations, we have tracked the transition from the first, high-mass star formation mode of the Pop III stars, to the low-mass mode that dominates today. We incorporated radiative cooling from metals into adaptive mesh-refinement hydrodynamic simulations, with cosmological initial conditions, and followed star formation in the standard LambdaCDM model across a range of metallicities, from 0 to 10^-2 Zsolar, beginning at redshift 99. Our results demonstrated that a dramatic transition to a low-mass mode of star formation appeared at a metallicity of 10^-3 Zsolar. Gas with this metallicity or higher was capable of cooling to the temperature of the CMB, resulting in fragmentation in the dense central core of the 5 x 10^5 Msolar dark matter halo, at redshift ~18. This permitted the formation of two low mass proto-stellar objects in the 10^-3 Zsolar simulation, each with masses between 10^-2 and 10^-1 Msolar. The conclusion is that the second generation stars produced a spectrum of lower mass stars, but still had higher masses on average than those formed in the local universe today."}
{"text":"\nStudies of the Milky Way reveal that about 25% of its globular clusters (GCs) have broadened stars in the horizontal-branch (HB) stage. Researchers believe this widening is caused by the presence of helium-rich, second-generation subpopulations, leading to the theory that these anomalies in GCs have distinctive Ancestries. The team investigated GCs in the Milky Way's inner halo to determine if there was a kinematic distinction in extended HB GCs versus normal clusters. The researchers found that extended HB GCs were significantly more massive than normal GCs and placed in an area of mostly random motion, with no correlation to metal content. Remarkably, when the extended HB GCs were excluded, the their more standard counterparts in the inner halo indicated signs of collapse that may have birthed the Milky Way's disc. Additionally, these findings established similarities between normal outer-halo GCs and ones with extended HB, which could imply their accretion origin. Ultimately, these observations demonstrate the variable origins of GCs and open up the possibility for further exploration of the hierarchical formation of the Milky Way."}
{"text":"In this paper, we refute a pseudo attack on the REESSE1+ cryptosystem. We provide examples, analyze the logic of deductions, and conduct experiments to prove that none of the claims made in the attack are sufficient. We also explain why the signature of REESSE1+ v2.1 is modified and point out that the original attack misunderstands certain properties. Finally, we conclude that in so far as the parameter Omega is properly chosen, the REESSE1+ cryptosystem with Cx = Ax * W^f(x) (% M) is secure."}
{"text":"\nUsing dynamical triangulations, the phase structure of a fluid surface model is determined within the conventional curvature model. The mechanical strength of the surface arises from elastic skeletons of linear-chains and rigid junctions, which form a compartmentalized structure on the surface. By means of Monte Carlo simulations, three distinct phases are observed: a tubular phase, a planar phase and a spherical phase, which are separated by discontinuous transitions. The inclusion of elastic skeletons introduces an inhomogeneous structure to the model, with different surface stregth inside and outside the compartments. Rotational symmetry, however, is preserved. In the low bending rigidity regime, a collapsed phase is likely to exist, but was not surveyed in this investigation. It is hypothesized that the variety of observed phases is due to the inhomogeneous structure and fluidity of vertices."}
{"text":"This study explores the affect of normal-phase clusters with a fractal boundary structure on the dynamics of a percolative superconductor. A comparison is drawn between the YBCO film, containing columnar defects, and the BSCCO\/Ag sheathed tape, as examples of these structures. Upon transitioning from a pinned vortex state to a resistive state during the percolation transition, an analysis of the dependence of free vortex density, resistance of the transport current, and current-voltage characteristics are made to reveal a vortex glass-type structure in this system."}
{"text":"A Time-Dependent Hartree-Fock theory is used to investigate the adaptation of\nmacroscopic features, such as charge and shape, in heavy nuclei fusion. The\npre-equilibrium Giant Dipole Resonance (GDR) is explored as a signpost for\nthis path. Results demonstrate that such isovector collective state was\nstimulated during the fusion of N\/Z asymmetric systems, though to a lesser\ndegree in mass asymmetric systems. Properties of GDR are determined by the\npreequilibrium phases' characteristics, such as deformation, vibration and\nrotation. In addition, we discovered that the preequilibrium GDR energy is\nlesser than the statistical energy. Re-examining experimental data, we can\nintuit this dispatching, perchance for the first time. Hence, we observed the\neffect of fusion-evaporation growth due to gamma ray releases coming from the\npre-equilibrium GDR.

{"text":"\nWe develop an algorithm to investigate the effectiveness of a decode-and-forward based cooperative data transmission strategy in a wireless relay network where multiple relay nodes are involved. We observe that in single-source single-destination networks, with an ordered set of relaying nodes, the decode-and-forward method yields data rates significantly higher than those enabled by the traditional point-to-point non-cooperative coding strategy. As the optimal route in terms of rate-maximizing could take a significant amount of time, we propose a heuristic approach running in polynomial time to identify it. To implement and compare the performance of our strategies, we use established  low density parity check codes."}
{"text":"\nThis paper examines a probabilistic cellular automaton that simulates the mutual survivability of predator and prey species. The individuals of each species are distributed over spots in a lattice while local stochastic update methods draw on the processes of the Lotka-Volterra model. A mean-field approach is employed at two levels, where the basic approximation is akin to an extended patch model describing the limited space available to species. The pairing approximation further allows for a stable, self-sustaining oscillation of population densities, by way of a Hopf bifurcation. Such oscillations are distinct from Lotka-Volterra cycles insofar as they are resistant to changes of initial conditions, making this model more biologically realistic than the Lotka-Volterra model."}
{"text":"This paper presents an examination of the unique cataclysmic variable SDSS J233325.92+152222.1, which is the IP with the shortest known orbital period of 83.12 +\/- 0.09 minutes. We perform phase-resolved spectroscopy and photometry in order to assess the evolutionary changes of intermediate polars. We estimate its white dwarf's magnetic moment to be mu(WD) ~ 2 x 10^33 G cm^3 which is similar to three of the other four confirmed short-period IPs, as well as the IPs of fewer long-period IPs. Our results suggest that the majority of long-period IPs which possess white dwarf spin periods around ten times lower than their orbital period likely transform into short-period IPs of SDSS J2333 type with spin periods higher than their orbital periods."}
{"text":"This article focuses on the complexity considerations of cSAT, and provides a lower bound for the problem being exponential (outside of P). It presents an algorithm for solving the problem using an NDTM in O(n^c), thus proving that P does not equal NP. Furthermore, this article confirms the relativized P=NP question, as well as the oracle constructed by Baker-Gill-Solovay which distinguishes between deterministic and non-deterministic calculation models. It is demonstrated that if the P=NP question is to hold in an oracle A, then this oracle must consist of either an infinite number of algorithms, DTMs, axioms and predicates, or an infinite number of simultaneous states in an NDTM."}
{"text":"\nWe conducted sub-arcsecond resolution observations of the prototypical hot core G29.96-0.02 in the 862mu band with the Submillimeter Array. Our observations revealed six submm continuum sources within 7800 (AU)^2, one of which being a proto-Trapezium system with estimated protostellar densities of 1.4x 10^5 protostars\/pc^3. Over 80 spectral lines were identified, from which the molecular outflow(s), core kinematics, temperature structure in the region, and chemical effects were studied. The hot core temperatures were around 300K, and interesting chemical diversities were found - for example, C34S was desorbed from grains and appeared in the gas phase. Additionally, the SiO (8-7) emission likely outlined two molecular outflows from the hot core region. Furthermore, a velocity gradient was present in a few lines, perpendicular to the large-scale outflow - not necessarily caused by a Keplerian disk, and could potentially be a result of gas core rotation or collapse."}
{"text":"\nAt particular filling factors, strongly correlated fermions governing systems on specific\ngeometrically frustrated lattices can exhibit excitations with fractional charges $\\pm e\/2$.  To\ninvestigate the ground states, low-lying excitations, and spectral functions of these lattices,\nwe employ numerical diagonalization. Most notably, the criss-crossed checkerboard lattice was found \nto have a degenerate ground state in addition to long-range ordering. These fractional charges \nare shown to be bound by a weak linear force, leading to large-spatial-extent bound states. Thus, \nthe quasi-particle weight is diminished, reflecting the composition of such fractionally charged \nexcitations. By exploiting a primary parameter, we are able to tune the system to a specially \ndefined 'Rokhsar-Kivelson' point at which fractional charges can be definitively identified as being\ndeconfined.

{"text":"This paper looks into the capacity of IEEE 802.11 multi-hop wireless networks with respect to the many-to-one throughput. Historically, it has been surmised that the throughput capacity would not exceed the individual link capacity. By introducing the concept of \"canonical networks\" which are more systematically organized than non-structured models, the paper shows that, in such networks, the upper limit of the throughput capacity when the sources are two or more hops away can be as high as 3L\/4. Experiments also indicated a peak throughput of 0.690L (0.740L) when the sources are distant hops away from the sink. Further research suggests that the upper bound for arbitrary structures may still be capped at 3L\/4. Moreover, when all the links are of identical length, the highest achievable throughput is 2L\/3. In random topologies with AODV routing, the throughputs fall significantly below the upper bounds. To address this issue, proper selection of routes and reorganization of relay nodes near the gateway can be beneficial, resulting in an increase in throughput by more than 150%."}
{"text":"\nIn this article, non-resonant and resonant x-ray scattering techniques were applied to single crystals of TbMn2O5 to gain a comprehensive understanding of its properties. Several intensities were detected at forbidden Bragg positions in the ferroelectric phases, as well as lattice and magnetism modulation peaks. Temperature dependent intensity of the peaks and the wave vector connection showed clear proof of exchange striction induced ferroelectricity. Through resonant scattering at Mn L-edge, Tb L- and M-edges, multiple magnetic orders with different temperature dependences were revealed. The transformation from a commensurate to incommensurate phase at 24 K is caused by discommensuration through spin frustration by the phase slipping of the magnetic orders. It is proposed that the low temperature incommensurate phase is formed by the separation of commensurate magnetic domains with anti-phased domain walls significantly reducing the spontaneous polarizations at the transition."}
{"text":"The present work combines experiments and MD simulations to probe the diffusion of Al and Ni in Al80Ni20 melts. Measured self-diffusion and interdiffusion coefficients are in agreement with simulation results, which additionally demonstrate a temperature-dependent thermodynamic factor \\Phi that minimizes in the undercooled regime. Additionally, the comparison reveals that the Darken equation adequately describes the dynamics of interdiffusion even at lower temperatures. Thus, dynamic cross-correlations are found to be largely unimportant for this system."}
{"text":"\nBy examining the radial variation of the mix of different stellar populations predicted by the multi-zone photo-chemical evolution code proposed by Pipino & Matteucci (2004), this article attempts to comprehend the mechanisms that lead to multiple globular cluster sub-populations within the most massive elliptical galaxies. The comparison of our results to the spectroscopic measurements of globular clusters in nearby early-type galaxies by Puzia et al. (2006) allows us to attribute the observed multi-modality of the globular cluster system to the radial variation in the level of star formation. Furthermore, we look into the non-linear mechanisms that could shape the metallicity distribution of globular cluster systems, such as merger-induced formation and a non-linear color-metallicity transformation, and discuss the implications of our model."}
{"text":"\nUsing the Swift observatory, we have conducted a monitoring campaign to observe IGR J11215-5952, belonging to the Supergiant Fast X-ray Transients (SFXTs) class, during its fifth outburst with a periodicity of ~330 days. This is the first SFXT with periodic outbursts and the most comprehensive monitoring of an SFXT outburst to date. The absorbing column of N_H = 1x10^22 cm^-2 and the power law photon index of 1 characterized its peak brightness with a 1-10 keV luminosity of ~10^36 erg s^-1. The observations cover the source's behaviour from the beginning of the outburst to near quiescence and show evidence of a longer accretion phase than previously suggested. The detected phenomenology of the outburst supports the hypothesis of a wide orbital eccentricity with many flares as a result of episodic or inhomogeneous accretion."}
{"text":"\nBased on the Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) observations of 41 Type 1 and Type 2 active galactic nuclei (AGNs), this research constitutes a systematic study of the [NeV] (14um\/24um) and [SIII] (18um\/33um) infrared line flux ratios that are typically applied to estimate the density of the ionized gas. The results indicate that the [NeV] line flux ratios observed in the majority of galaxies with both these lines detected are compatible with the theoretical low density limit, assuming current collision strengths and omitting absorption and stimulated emission. A distinction is made between the measurements of Type 1 and Type 2 AGNs, with the latter having lower ratios than the former. We postulate that the lower ratios in Type 2 AGNs can be attributed to different infrared extinction due to dust found in the torus. Additionally, analysis of the extended [SIII] emission was implemented, which originated mainly from star forming regions, demonstrating that any application of line flux ratios resulting from slits of varying sizes is invalid for most nearby galaxies."}
{"text":"We demonstrate that non-Abelian gauge fields may serve as pseudo-Goldstone vector bosons caused by spontaneous Lorentz violation (SLIV). To explore this concept, we examine a general Yang-Mills type theory with a SLIV constraint of $Tr(% \\boldsymbol{A}_{\\mu\n}\\boldsymbol{A}^{\\mu})=\\pm M^{2}$ (where $M$ is the proposed SLIV scale). This constraint also breaks an internal symmetry group $G$ with $D$ generators to a larger accidental symmetry of SO(D,3D), thereby introducing $D$ pseudo-Goldstone vector bosons in addition to the lone genuine Goldstone vector boson. These pseudo-Goldstone bosons remain massless due to the Yang-Mills theory's gauge invariance. Low-order interactions may demonstrate Lorentz and\/or $CPT$ violation but no SLIV effects, as all are exactly cancelled, necessitating the breaking of gauge invariance to achieve measurable SLIV effects. If the SLIV scale is comparable to the Planck scale, then Lorentz violation could be detected at low energies."}
{"text":" This article investigates the impact that alterations to nucleon-nucleon \n($NN$) cross sections which occur in heavy ion collisions ($HIC$) at \nintermediate energies may have on particle production. Using a relativistic \ntransport approach, we observe how modifications in the {\\it inelastic} cross \nsections can greatly alter pion and kaon yields, as well as the rapidity \ndistributions, associated with them. Interestingly, when looking at the \n$(\\pi^{-}\/\\pi^{+})$ and $(K^{0}\/K^{+})$ yield ratios, the effect of these \nin-medium inelastic cross section modifications is relatively minor. This is \nespecially so for kaon ratio yields, due to the homogenous nature of kaon \nproduction in high-density regimes. Evaluations in two seperate manners of \nkaon potential - chiral perturbative approach and an effective meson-quark \ncoupling method - offer consistent results, and the overall conclusion is \nthat a repulsive energy for both $K^{+}$ and $K^{0}$ is likely. With this in \nmind, it appears that these particle ratios can still serve as a useable tool \nfor probing the nuclear equation of state ($EoS$) and its isovector sector \nat high baryon densities."}
{"text":"\nThis paper presents an algorithm which prevents energy violations caused by the finite step size of a trajectory of particles relative to unbonded state potential interactions while undergoing crossover via a switching mechanism. The algorithm effectively conserves both energy and momentum in the dynamics, and is tested by examining energy flow rate and temperature\/pressure invariance in a hysteresis loop reaction model. The results show that the algorithm satisfies the criteria of energy and momentum conservation as desired for molecular dynamics simulation of thermodynamic systems."}
{"text":"\nThis paper presents a method of constructing composite-fermion wave functions as correlators of conformal field theory (CFT). The method is applied to the Laughlin wave function at $\\nu=1\/m$ and the Pfaffian wave function at $\\nu=1\/2$, resulting in one-quasiparticle wave functions identical to the respective composite-fermion wave functions and two-quasiparticle wave functions with correct fractional charge and statistics. In addition, a type of fermionic vertex operator $V_{p,n}$ is constructed from $n$ free compactified bosons and then used to exactly represent composite-fermion wave functions from the Jain series $\\nu=s\/(2sp+1)$; the accompanying quasiparticle- and quasihole operators have the expected fractional charges and statistics. Lastly, the CFTs of Wen's general classification of quantum Hall states are found to coincide with those of the chiral CFTs in the cases of the filling fractions 2\/5 and 3\/7, demonstrating a possible general connection between these two theories. In all, this paper provides a procedure for generating ground states and quasiparticle wave functions of fractional Hall states."}
{"text":"\nThis work addresses the prospects of transit surveys within stellar clusters, taking into account the effects of correlated noise and the necessity for radial velocity follow-up. We develop new equations to demonstrate how noise impacts detection statistics for box-shaped transits, and how stellar mass affects this outcome. Our results indicate that, when correlated noise is a constant and radial velocity follow-up is mandatory, the potential of presumptive surveys is significantly diminished in clusters. However, we posit that through the utilization of small, wide-field instruments, the discovery of hot Neptunes and the subsequent execution of radial velocity measurements are achievable in nearer clusters (less than 100 pc away)."}
{"text":" We have analyzed the three-dimensional photospheric flow of a Supergranular (SG) area based upon the magnetic network that serves as a proxy. Utilizing Two-Level Structure Tracking (TST) with high spatial, spectral and temporal resolution from IBIS, we were able to reconstruct the full 3D velocity vector field from two different photospheric heights. The cork tracing technique was also applied to better comprehend the large scale radial flow of SG. We also examined how the horizontal and line of sight plasma flows correspond with clusters of bright CaII structures. Our results suggest that the flow of the SG is organized by an almost radial flow from its center to its perimeter. The divergence observed is likely caused by a region of constant, up-flowing air near the SG's center. On the edge, isolated regions of strong convergent flow are usually near or coupled with large clusters of bright CaII wing features which form the magnetic network knots."}
{"text":"\nIn this study, we explored and characterized any detected substructures of galaxies from the wide-field CCD images of the 77 nearby clusters of the WIde-field Nearby Galaxy-cluster Survey (WINGS), with a redshift range of 0.04<z<0.07. To detect these substructures, an adaptive-kernel procedure called DEDICA was used, and its reliability tested with Monte-Carlo simulations of the observed frames. Results of this experiment found that of the 55 clusters studied, 40 had a total of 69 substructures of similar redshift (confirmed with color-magnitude diagrams). This 73% proportion of clusters with substructures is higher than seen in many other studies. It was also determined that the brightness of the brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) is affected by the presence of subclusters, and the recorded differential distribution of subcluster luminosities was consistent with the theoretical prediction of the differential mass function of substructures in cosmological simulations."}
{"text":"\nWe analyze the impact of a quenched disorder term in the Hamiltonian on the depinning transition of continuous height effective interfaces that have a delta-pinning at height zero. Mathematical research has previously shown that the variance of the interface height with respect to the Gibbs measure stays bounded uniformly in the volume for any positive pinning force and diverges like the logarithm of the pinning strength when it tends to zero. Surprisingly, with just an arbitrary small random field in 2D, the delta-pinning force is not strong enough to prevent localized motion and delocalization. To prove this, we give a rigorous lower bound for the overlap between local magnetizations and random fields in finite volume. This lower bound shows that in 2 dimensions the overlap grows faster than the volume size, resulting in a contradiction to localization. Our complementary inequality further reveals that in higher dimensions this fraction of pinned sites goes to one when the pinning force reaches infinity."}
{"text":"This study revisits a theoretical model for dust formation in the ejecta of core collapse supernovae, and follows the evolution of newly condensed grains to their survival - via the reverse shock - in the SN remnant. Results suggest that between 0.1 - 0.6 M_sun of dust can form from 12 - 40 M_sun stellar progenitors, with 2-20% of this dust surviving the shockwave, over a period of 4-8 x 10^4 years. Analyses of the dust extinction curves derived from these findings demonstrate correlation with those from a reddened quasar at z = 6.2, while stochastic heating of small grains leads to a wide range of dust temperatures. This implies that large amounts of cold dust (T ~ 40K) can remain in the remnant, with no conflict to observed IR emission."}
{"text":"\nThis study examines 27 housing price indices from the zip codes of Las Vegas from June 1983 to March 2005. Evidence of a bubble period is found from 2003 to mid-2004, when the prices accelerated to an exponential rate much faster than prior or subsequent periods. Furthermore, a yearly periodicity which could enable more precise monthly forecasting is observed. A model has been created to predict the housing indexes one year ahead, which has been tested with data up to September 2006. The findings indicate notable discrepancies between the Las Vegas bubble and the approximate two year later USA bubble, with the former ending mid-2004 and the latter lasting until mid-2006."}
{"text":"\nIn this article, we examine effects of local fields on radiatively broadened magneto-dielectric media. Through a microscopic approach of deriving the Clausius-Mossotti relations for an isotropic and homogeneous medium, the electromagnetic propagators are calculated for a bi-cubic lattice where the lattice constant is small relative to the resonance wavelength. Such modifications to the elementary oscillators such as transition frequencies and linewidths are taken into account while considering the singular self-interaction terms. The index of refraction is observed to have a real part close to -2 in the limit of a high number density of scattering and virtually no imaginary part. These local field influences can potentially provide materials with low-losses and negative index of refraction."}
{"text":"\nThis research article presents the results of an analysis performed to investigate the presence of Colour Reconnection in WW events using the DELPHI detector at the Large Electron-Positron Collider (LEP-2). The hypothesis of Colour Reconnection is that when two hadronic systems emerging from two highly energetic bosons are close in spacetime, soft gluon exchange may occur between them, leading to changes in the final state of the hadrons. In order to study this effect two complementary techniques were combined, one studying the particle flow between jets and the other one using mass estimators from W bosons to set the final value of the kappa parameter of the SK-I model. The results show that Colour Reconnection is possible with a probability of 31% to 68% at 68% confidence level and its best value corresponds to a kappa parameter at kappa_{SK-I} = 2.2^{+2.5}_{-1.3}."}
{"text":"\nIn this article, we explore the potential of Evolutionary Neural Gas (ENG) as a model of self organizing network that is able to take into account a wide range of external inputs. This model is different than traditional self organizing networks in the sense that there are no topological constraints, and the evolution is dictated by probabilistic laws that depend on the local distortion errors and the network dimension. This creates an ecosystem of randomly connected nodes that can quickly adapt to environmental inputs. An analysis of ENG reveals that the network evolves as a scale-free graph, a feature that gives it the justification of the term 'gas' as used here."}
{"text":"\nIn this article, we investigate the solution of the nonlinear BK evolution equation with recently calculated running coupling corrections [hep-ph\/0609105, hep-ph\/0609090]. After creating a numerical solution, it can be confirmed that once these corrections are included, it produces a universal scaling behavior of the dipole scattering amplitude which was identified in [hep-ph\/0408216]. Additionally it has been established that the shape of the scaling function is noticeably altered in comparison to the fixed coupling case. This change results in an increase in the anomalous dimension and a slowing of the evolution with rapidity. We explore the subtraction terms that arise due to the running coupling corrections being present and compute the numerical solution of the resulting full non-linear evolution equation. Remarkably, the scaling regime is once again observed at high rapidity."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate the structure and kinematics of the circumstellar disk around the Herbig Ae star HD 163296 using millimeter imaging from IRAM\/PBI, SMA and VLA observations. Our results demonstrate that the disk material is in Keplerian rotation around the central star of 2.6 solar masses, inclined at 46 +-4 degrees from the line of sight and with a position angle of 128 +-4 degrees. We also measure a slope of 1 between 0.87 and 7 mm in dust opacity, suggesting the presence of mm\/cm-size dust grains in the disk midplane. The dust continuum emission is confined to within a radius of 200 AU while CO extends out to 540 AU. We furthermore find an increasing depletion of CO isotopomers from 12CO to 13CO and C18O. Our findings are consistent with a strongly evolved disk around HD 163296, possibly due to inward migration of large bodies causing the dust to be depleted relative to the gas outside of 200 AU or the formation of a low mass companion causing a gap in the dust distribution."}
{"text":"\nWe conducted spectropolarimetric measurements of the Ca II 8498 A and 8542 A lines in a quiet Sun zone located near a dissipating active area, and compared the outcomes with a simulation of the lines in a high plasma-beta environment. Results from cluster analysis of the Stokes V data indicates that the local magnetic environment of the network believed to have been responsible for the development of the two lines has more impact on the Stokes V profiles' characters than the standing wave's phase. Additionally, we observed that Stokes V asymmetries are prevalent in the network, with the obtained amplitude and area asymmetry histograms demonstrating significant discrepancies when compared to the simulations. Lastly, evidence of oscillations in both the network and internetwork was noted within the Ca II lines, being more rigorous in the former, where fluctuations resemblant to those in the high-beta simulation were noted with frequent large self-reversals in the intensity profiles."}
{"text":"  An exploration of MSSM heavy neutral Higgs bosons is presented based on the CMS experiment with integrated luminosity of 30 and 60 fb$^{-1}$. Utilizing both the latest experimental sensitivity studies and theoretical predictions of MSSM Higgs-boson characteristics, the search capability is interpreted in terms of the parameters tan$\\beta$ and M$_A$. Examination of the 5 sigma discovery contours with respect to varying other supersymmetric parameters shows that a change in the higgsino mass parameter $\\mu$ can alter the prospective discovery reach (the \"LHC wedge\" region) by around 10 Delta tan$\\beta$. Furthermore, a high-precision measurement of the heavy neutral Higgs boson masses may be feasible and potentially help detect the signals of the two heavy MSSM Higgs bosons at the LHC in favourable regions of the MSSM parameter space."}
{"text":"\n\nThis study examines the time-based alterations of step-edge fluctuations due to conditions of electromigration. A continuum Langevin model is used to investigate what happens when the electromigration driving force works in an up\/down direction and step-edge diffusion is the primary means of material transfer. Results display deviations from usual $t^{1\/4}$ scaling of terrace-width correlation functions at a well-defined time $\\tau$ that depends on three particular energy scales: $k_B T$, the step stiffness $\\gamma$, and the influence of the electromigration force $\\pm\\Delta U$ on adatom hopping. Between 0 and $\\tau$, correlation function evolves as a combination of $t^{1\/4}$ and $t^{3\/4}$; however, a closed-form expression can be found for times beyond $\\tau$. Confirmation was obtained via Monte Carlo simulation based on a discrete model of the step dynamics. Moreover, it is proposed that the force exerted on a step-edge atom by electromigration can be estimated via analyzing step-edge fluctuations at the appropriate time."}
{"text":"\nBy means of a steerable wavelet that involves the second derivative of a Gaussian, we can now visually inspect, for the first time, the correlation between cosmic microwave background (CWM) and large scale structure of the Universe on a local level. This approach reveals the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect that is consistent with dark energy through the use of three morphological measures -the signed-intensity, orientation and elongation- made from WMAP and NVSS data. The correlations are significant at 99.9% and instrumental systematics and foreground contamination are ruled out as their origin. Therefore, this new morphological analysis delivers independent evidence for dark energy as well as a better way to explore its nature in the future."}

{"text":"\nThis article presents a method for detecting and characterizing low-mass planetary systems by measuring the transit timing variations (TTVs) between planets. We explore the possibility of using a modest network of telescopes to observe TTVs and identify planets, which can complement other methods of planet detection. We discuss how this technique is especially sensitive to mean-motion resonances, where other detection techniques are not. Furthermore, detectors of sub-Earth mass planets already exist, though current detection mechanisms are limited by the lack of high-precision transit data and a insufficient allocation of observing time. We suggest that a network of telescopes, each 0.5m in size, could be used to increase the efficiency of TTV detection, which could greatly expedite the discoveries of low-mass planetary systems in the future."}
{"text":"This article presents a Finite Element framework for obtaining the normal modes and mechanical responses of proteins and assemblies of proteins. Motivated by the Elastic Network model, these proteins are modeled as uniform and anisotropic elastic solids with volume defined by their solvent-excluded surface. A surface simplification algorithm is used to represent the Finite Element structure which aids in generating models of various spatial resolutions. The procedure is applied to a T4 phage lysozyme mutant and a filamentous actin to determine their normal modes as well as the critical Euler buckling load when subject to axial compression. The results of this method favorably compare with experimental data, Rotation Translation Blocks and all-atom normal mode analyses. This procedure can incorporate atomic-level interactions, such as aqueous-electrolyte-mediated electrostatics, and can be usedon proteins with or without known atomic coordinates."}
{"text":"\nThe aim of this article is to investigate the effects of the coronal background on the measurement of the widths of EUV loops and analyze the accuracy of the procedure used in a previous paper (L\\'opez Fuentes, Klimchuk & D\\'emoulin 2006) to measure their rates of expansion. To do this, synthetic loops are placed on real backgrounds taken from observational data obtained by Transition Region and Coronal Explorer (\\textit{TRACE}) and the same procedure used before is implemented. It is found that the procedure enables us to correctly identify uniform loops from those which expand noticeably with altitude, as previously predicted via theoretical models. Furthermore, the procedure is capable of determining when the loops are beyond the resolution limit, leading to unreliable measurements. Examination of the results reveals that errors in the loop width calculations arise from discrepancies between the loop and background brightness that can particularly be observed in thin loops and sections of the background which have significant brightness compared to the loops. It is emphasized, however, that these effects do not prevent the detection of large-scale variations. The general conclusion is that the loop widths do not display any distinct increase in ratio with height and this result is confirmed to be reliable."}
{"text":"\nThis study utilized two narrow band filters, Subaru\/SuprimeCam 8150A and 9140A, to survey a half square degree of space and search for ultra-strong emission line galaxies (USELs). After spectral verification with KeckII\/DEIMOS, 542 USELs consisting of strong-emission line galaxies of intermediate redshifts (z < 1) and Lyman Alpha emitting galaxies of high redshitfs (z >> 5) were identified. The H beta luminosity functions and star formation density of these USELs were then determined and were found to be 5-10% of the value found from UV continuum objects at similar redshifts, signifying a major epoch of galaxy formation at these redshifts. Many of the USELs showed temperature-sensitive [OIII] 4363 auroral lines and a dozen of these were found to have oxygen abundances characteristic of the most distant XMPGs known today. These XMPGs were found to have low metallicities, close to the minimum found in local galaxies, and their luminosities, metallicities and star formation rates are consistent with them being start-up intermediate mass galaxies, suggesting that galaxies are still being formed in relatively unexplored and chemically pristine sites at z < 1."}
{"text":"We have detected a dusty debris disk surrounding the F2V star HD 15115 using the Hubble Space Telescope in the optical and Keck adaptive optics in the near-infrared. This disk is especially notable for its intense length asymmetry, with the east side detected at approximately 315 AU of radius and the west side detected at a radius of over 550 AU. We found that the optical to near-infrared color of the scattered light is similar to AU Mic's debris disk. Linkages to the Beta Pic moving group were previously believed through kinematic arguments, now bolstered by the existence of the large debris disk. We conjecture that the extreme asymmetry could be due to dynamical perturbations from the nearby M star, HIP 12545, which shares a common proper motion vector, heliocentric distance, galactic space velocity, and age."}
{"text":"By examining CMB data, the validity of string theory can be tested. The current upper limit on the ratio of tensor to scalar perturbations, r=T\/S, is r < 0.3. Future detection of tensor modes may occur in the range of r > 10^{-2} - 10^{-3}. In traditional string theory inflation models, this would present a challenge as it predicts that these tensor values will remain far below the level of detection. In relation, the KKLT construction limits the Hubble constant H during inflation to a value smaller than the gravitino mass, resulting in an upper bound of r < 10^{-24}. If this is seen, then it would suggest the gravitinos in this model would be superheavy, m_{3\/2} > 10^{13} GeV, providing significant implications for particle phenomenology associated with string theory."}
{"text":"This study proposed a neurodynamical model of a neural circuit for quantifying the behavioral response to strong aversive stimuli in terms of memory, synaptic plasticity and feelings derived from classical electrostatics. The coefficients of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) applied to the output spike train revealed the behavioral information of each neuron, which in turn mapped to form a behaviour in a multidimensional vector space. It was found that the model was consistent with prior observations of sequential behavioural dynamics, while the electrophysiological basis of the model could be potentially extended to hemodynamic functions. Thus, this model provided a potential insight into neurobehavioral responses to aversive stimuli in the human brain."}
{"text":"\nThrough the use of cosmological chemodynamical simulations, we investigate the effects of galactic winds from star-forming galaxies on the features of hydrogen (HI) and metal (CIV and OVI) absorption systems in the intergalactic medium at high redshift. We find that the outflows travel to low density regions, while hardly affecting the denser filaments shown in HI absorption. Our models show that HI absorption is not lessened by winds, but can actually be slightly increased. We also notice that a lack of HI absorption near galaxies, observed by Adelberger et al., can be caused by hot gas created by accretion shock heating. On the other hand, metal absorption lines are strongly affected by the presence of winds \u2014 in particular, models without winds can create strong CIV and OVI lines within 50 kpc from galaxies, while strong winds can produce these lines out to about 100 kpc. Additionally, we examine the transmissivity of HI, CIV, and OVI within 1 h$^{-1}$ Mpc from star-forming galaxies, with our results demonstrating that the probability distribution of HI transmissivity is unaffected by different strengths of supernova (SN) feedback. However, strong SN feedback leads to weaker metal line transmissivity. Furthermore, strong feedback creates strong OVI lines even in cases where HI absorption is weak. Our findings imply that OVI is most likely the top indicator of galactic winds at high redshift."}
{"text":"\nWe conducted an integral field spectroscopic survey for high redshift damped Lyman-alpha galaxies, focusing on nine quasars with 14 DLAs and 8 sub-DLAs present in their spectra. Our survey was able to confirm two of the systems, and identified six new candidate Ly-alpha emitting DLA galaxies. The new candidates showed similar line fluxes and widths as the 6 already confirmed Ly-alpha emitting galaxies, although spectrum shifts between in emission lines and DLAs redshifts were larger. The new candidates had impact parameters generous than 10kpc, and lower column density systems seemed to be located at larger distances. The average candidate DLA galaxy is probably enshrouded by an extended, exponentially scaled neutral gas cloud with a radius of ~5kpc."}
{"text":"\nWe analyze the changes in flux of faint, unresolved optical sources in the SDSS Stripe 82 by monitoring their photometric brightness across the SDSS ugriz bands. Our catalog collected 1.4 million observations and identified that 2% of these sources brighter than g=20.5 demonstrated a 0.05 mag (rms) variation simultaneously in both the g and r bands. Of these sources, two-thirds were found to be low-redshift quasars, although they only constitute 2% of all sources in the flux-limited sample. We establish that, at the 0.03 mag level, over 90% of quasars are variable and thus variability serves as a viable indicator for the selection of low-redshift quasars at high galactic latitudes. Further examinations of the quasar lightcurve skewness prove it is centered at zero. We also observe that roughly a quarter of the variable stars are RR Lyrae stars, and that only 0.5% of the sources in the main stellar locus demonstrate 0.05 mag of variability. Using over 600 RR Lyrae stars, we have detected halo substructures out to distances of 100 kpc. Predictions made by the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope estimate it will detect 2 million low-redshift quasars that display 0.02 mag (rms) variability, in addition to a total of 50 million variable stars."}
{"text":"\nIdentifying the ionization, density and composition of interstellar material at the borders of the heliosphere can help set the boundary conditions. With the usage of radiative transfer ionization models, we create a grid of models representing a potential range of the Local Interstellar Cloud (LIC) and Local Bubble (LB) attributes. We integrate observational evidence, including data gathered through in situ observations of He^O, pickup ions and anomalous cosmic rays, along with absorption line measurements towards epsilon CMa, to narrow down the characteristics of the finite model. The calculated interstellar gas at the Sun is characterized by a low density, partially ionized state with a temperature of 6300 K, X(H^+) ~ 0.2, and X(He^+) ~ 0.4, and abundances of Mg, Si and Fe bearing values that are sub-solar, possibly O and N that are sub-solar, and S at a solar level. Additionally, our results indicate a preference for low values of reference solar abundances for LIC composition. Nevertheless, the results of acceptable models achieved with the proposed radiation fields show that our assumptions remain valid."}
{"text":"This article examines the boundary conditions and binary models of Long Gamma-Ray Burst Progenitors. It suggests that low-metallicity might be a necessary condition in order for a massive star to evolve to the collapsar stage, and binary models reveal that the progenitor of the GRB is most likely a massive helium star with a close companion. We investigate the interaction between the closely-packed binary system and the core-helium burning, analyzing the tidal synchronization that occurs on a short timescale and the strong core-envelope coupling in the later evolutionary stages. These findings suggest that helium stars with a main-sequence companion are unlikely to produce a GRB or hypernova, yet those that have a neutron-star or black-hole companion have a chance of becoming a GRB progenitor."}
{"text":"An extensive multiscale model of electronic behavior and localization in stretched dry DNA has been constructed. With the use of accurate density-functional-theory calculations to model electronic states in the bases and base pairs of DNA, combined with semi-empirical quantum mechanics for a small size [18 base pair poly(CG)-poly(CG)] dry, neutral DNA sequence, an effective tight-binding model was produced. This model helps to demonstrate how environmental things such as stray water molecules or the substrate can cause electron localization. Results from this model showed that the localization length in stretched DNA is several orders of magnitude smaller than that in the unstretched structure."}
{"text":"\n\nThis study looks at the production of J\/psi particles in different stages of Au-Au collisions at both RHIC and LHC energies. Specifically, we include the production of any color singlet or octet ccbar pairs at short distances before they expand to a full size of J\/psi. Calculations are made to show the J\/psi number distribution as a function of transverse momentum and rapidity depending on the partonic channels ab to ccbar [{2S+1}L_J] and ab to ccbar [{2S+1}L_J]x as well as two reactions: (a) color singlet ccbar plus a gluon turns to color octet ccbar and (b) color octet ccbar plus a gluon persists as color octet. The results demonstrate a bulge within -1.5<y<1.5 in the J\/psi number distribution and the ratio of J\/psi number distributions for Au-Au collisions to nucleon-nucleon collisions due to the partonic system, hence indicating the existence of a deconfined partonic medium. To aid further research, it is suggested that future experiments at RHIC and LHC measure in the region of -3<y<3."}
{"text":"\nThis article investigates a Hamiltonian formalism in Friedmann cosmology, introducing a variable equation of state and varying cosmological constant. Presenting a system with a single degree of freedom and no constraints, equivalent to a mechanical system with a changing mass particle in a potential field, the Friedmann equations are recovered as the equation of motion. We explore simplifying the system through a transformation of the scale factor, leading to a particle of fixed mass in an effective potential field. The $\\Lambda$ cold dark matter model equates to an harmonic oscillator in this context, and the formalism is extended to incorporate elements of bulk viscosity. Finally, utilising a straightforward approach, the Hamiltonian is observed to be quantized, displaying a contrast from the approach of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation in quantum cosmology."}
{"text":"This paper presents an analysis of the optimal stimulus and noise distributions for transmiting information efficiently through suprathreshold stochastic resonance (SSR). Previous work done in computational neuroscience and electronics is verified and justified by this paper. First, a sufficient condition for optimality, i.e. channel capacity is derived from the relation between Shannon's mutual information and Fisher information. The results demonstrate the maximum capacity is obtained when the signal distribution is Jeffrey's prior formed from the noise distribution or when the noise distribution is related to the signal distribution via a cosine relationship."}
{"text":"\n\nIn this article, we examine the alignment of three distinct types of galaxies within dark matter halos utilizing a large selection of galaxy groups sourced from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Specifically, we measure the alignment of the brightest group galaxy (BGG) and its satellites, the radial alignment of a satellite galaxy in relation to the BGG, and the direct alignment of a BGG and its satellites. We detect an abundance of red satellites being preferentially aligned in relation to the major axis inside 0.7 \\Rvir. However, blue satellite galaxies are more evenly scattered, suggesting an isotropic orientation. Additionally, a weak yet significant direct alignment amongst the BGG and its satellites is found within 0.1 \\Rvir. The findings from this research are discussed and their applications to weak lensing measurements are explored."}
{"text":"\nThis paper presents new spectroscopic and existing MSX observations of the massive runaway star BD+43 3654. Our observations reveal that it is an O4If star with an estimated mass of 70 (+\/- 15) solar masses and an age of about 1.6 million years. Its well-defined bow shock, seen in MSX observations, reveals an orientation in the plane of the sky that is concordant with its proper motion. Backtracking its path across the sky, its origins can be traced to the densest region of the Cygnus OB2 association at a time similar to its estimated age. BD+43 3654 is thus one of the three most massive runaway stars known and its formation could have been caused by dynamical ejection."}
{"text":"This study investigates the circumstellar SiO maser emissions within the envelope of the oxygen-rich evolved star R Leo.

Results confirmed previously held conclusions on oxygen-rich envelopes, that the 28SiO v=2 transition is produced in an inner layer, closer to the star and the 86GHz line arises in a farther shell. Furthermore, for the first time, the 29SiO v=0 J=1-0 emission was mapped in R Leo. A discrepancy between observed distributions of different maser lines and the theoretical predictions was observed."}
{"text":"We explore the supergravity description of 2-charge D1-D5 non-singular fuzzballs with internal excitations on T^4 and K3. We find that these excitations are represented by arbitrary curves and can be characterized through the middle cohomology of the internal manifolds. By computing the holographic data within the solutions, we determine that each geometry is dual to a specific superposition of R ground states, described by the Fourier coefficients of the curves. Furthermore, the chiral primaries associated with the middle cohomology acquire vevs in the superpositions, verifying the existence of internal excitations. Finally, we analyze whether these fuzzballs can be consistently implemented in supergravity."}
{"text":"\nThe aim of this paper is to explore how to incorporate CP violation in the context of the Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism. To this end, we employ non-renormalizable interactions in the fermion mass sector with a flavor democratic structure. It is found that, in order to generate CP violation, at least two iso-singlet scalar fields with a discrete symmetry are necessary. These two scalar fields carry a relative phase between their vacuum expectation values. In the simplest model, the alance of quark masses and the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix, including the CP violation factor, are set by |V_{us}| and the ratio of their two expectation values, R=|R|e^{i*alpha} (with a magnitude and a phase). Subsequently, it is shown that the angles phi_i (i=1--3) of the unitarity triangle and the CKM off-diagonal elements |V_{ub}| and |V_{cb}| can be expressed in terms of |V_{us}|, |R| and \\alpha. The predicted value of the CP violating phase, however, does not coincide with the experimental data in the simple model, indicating that further refinements in our approach may be needed to adequately account for CP violation."}
{"text":"\nIn this article, we focus on the rigorous study of periodic oscillation of a heavy piston with mass $M$, separating two gas chambers, each containing a fixed number of ideal, unit mass particles in any spatial dimension $d$, where $d \\geq 1$. We show that the motion of the piston converges in probability to its predicted averaged behavior on a time scale $M^{1\/2}$ when $M$ tends towards infinity, assuming a bounded total energy of the system and a fixed number of gas particles. Neishtadt and Sinai previously argued that this situation should follow an averaging theorem by Anosov. For the piston case in one dimension, $d=1$, we prove a rate of convergence of $\\mathcal{O}(M^{-1\/2})$ on a time scale $M^{1\/2}$, uniformly over all initial conditions in a compact set. We then generalize our results to multiple pistons, $N$, between $N+1$ gas chambers, and then provide a general discussion of averaging theory and proofs of relevant known results. Additionally, a new proof of Anosov's averaging theorem for smooth systems, mostly due to Dolgopyat, is presented."}
{"text":"This article proposes a study of ring opening reactions of cyclobutane, cyclopentane, and cyclohexane using quantum chemical calculations. A biradical decomposition model is defined for each alkane and evaluated at the CBS-QB3 level of theory. The energy output of the reaction (\\delta H^0_f, S^0, C^0_p) is obtained through isodesmic reactions of the molecules, and hindered rotors are taken into account. In addition, activation energies are computed to discover the most favorable pathways of the biradical decomposition, and rate constants are determined at temperatures ranging from 600-2000 K and a pressure of 1 atm. Comparison of the predicted results to experimental observations is used to validate the theoretical approach. The importance of rotational barriers between conformers is evident, and ring strain energies are postulated to calculate the energy removed during the activation process."}
{"text":"This paper provides a review of theoretical and experimental research into thermal effects in solid-state lasers, particularly those based on Ytterbium-doped materials.

This work will first explain some of the primary characteristics of Yb-doped materials followed by an analysis of how to measure the temperature map and associated thermal lensing effects. This is followed by a discussion of the definition of the thermo-optic coefficient and potential misreading of experiments that use the dn\/dT parameter. The review concludes with a state-of-the-art functional summary of the highest quality experimental techniques used to monitor thermal lensing and a couple of examples of Yb-doped solid-state laser materials."}
{"text":"\nThis study presents a numerical and analytical evaluation of the optical near-field behavior emanating from subwavelength grooves etched into silver surfaces. The Green's tensor approach is used to analyze the phase and intensity of the diffracted wave in relation to varying groove geometries. It is discovered that the diffraction field along the interface is analogous to analyzing this kind of field from a vibrating dipolar line source. By combining the Green's function with a semi-analytical model, a description of the transient near-zone regime and its dependence on the wavelength is given. This model may be utilized for constructing photonic circuits and optimizing their performance, as the behavior is largely dependent on the surface waves."}

{"text":"\nIn this paper, we study gravitational wave signals originating from a point mass interacting with a disk in a Newtonian gravitational system. The motion of a particle in such a system is likely to be chaotic when the gravitational force of the disk is close to that of the point mass. We observe that in some orbits, the particle motion becomes nearly regular (labelled as 'stagnant motion') for a certain amount of time between each chaotic period. To study the influence chaotic behaviours have on the observation of gravitational waves, we aim to analyse the correlation between the waves and the behaviour of the particle. Our results indicate that each chaotic behaviour involved in the waveforms and energy spectra can be distinguishable. The waveforms generated from the stagnant motion are notably different from that from the more chaotic or regular motion."}
{"text":"\nRXTE and XMM-Newton observations of the Seyfert galaxy NGC 3783 have revealed a flattened power spectral density (PSD) similar to those of Galactic black hole X-ray binaries (GBHs) in a 'hard' state. However, the low radio flux does not support the 'hard' state interpretation and the AGN's accretion rate (7% of the Eddington rate) is larger than that of the GBH Cyg X-1 (2%), making NGC 3783 an outlier in such comparisons. A more extended 5.5-year dataset was used to investigate the PSD of NGC 3783 more accurately. The best-fit model of the PSD indicates a 'soft' state, rather than an unusual 'hard' state, as the only break lies at high frequencies. This result is consistent with expectations based on accretion rate and black hole mass, eliminating NGC 3783 as an outlier. In contrast, Arakelian 564 seems to have a second break at low frequencies, however this is attributed to its very high accretion rate suggesting a `very high' state, not a 'hard' state PSD."}

We look into the various traffic profiles and flow criteria to assess the efficiency of the sampling process in NetFlow, and also propose possible solutions to improve monitoring data accuracy."}
{"text":"\nThis paper conducts an evaluation of how the J^2 tensor component affects the effects of the Skyrme energy density functional on properties of spherical nuclei. We develop a set of 36 parameterizations, using a fitting process near identical to the successful SLy parameterizations, by considering the effects of isoscalar and isovector tensor term coupling constants. We measure the influence of the tensor terms on shape of spin-orbit splittings and single-particle spectrums of doubly-magic nuclei, shifts in spin-orbit splittings in sequences of semi-magic nuclei, mass anomalies of spherical nuclei, and noticeable inconsistencies in charge radii. Our ultimate realization is that the central and spin-orbit components of the Skyrme energy density functional are not flexible enough to permit for larger tensor terms."}
{"text":" We present the analysis of eight high-redshift, X-ray-selected, obscured quasars found in our survey of the HELLAS2XMM region. Utilizing IRAC and MIPS 24 micron data, optical and Ks-band photometry, we construct spectral energy distributions (SEDs) that accurately match the observed data. By applying the bolometric luminosity and the M_BH-L_K relation, we estimate the masses and Eddington ratios of the quasars' black holes to be between 0.2-2.5 x 10^9 Mo and L\/L_Edd<0.1, respectively. The median 2-10 keV bolometric correction from the survey was found to be ~25, consistent with the value derived by Elvis et al. (1994). These objects appear to be in a low-accretion phase, due to their high stellar and black hole masses."}

Applying the technique to networks which capture the collaboration between scientists and the calls between mobile phone users, we identify the conditions which lead to the stability and adaptability in large and small social groups. Additionally, we quantitatively show that the level of engagement of the individuals involved can be used to estimate the lifespan of a community. Our results provide a new way of understanding the differences between the evolutionary trajectories of large organizations and small clusters of people."}
{"text":"\nIn this article, we demonstrate for the first time the entanglement of two independent photons through time measurement. This method removes the need for synchronization and can be easily implemented with continuous wave (CW) sources. Our approach combines recent advancements in achieving high-precision timing with photon detectors, paired-photon production with nonlinear waveguides crystals, and long-coherence narrow-band filters. Furthermore, our approach is special as it is independent of the specific form of entanglement demonstrated; in this case, time-bin entangled photons at telecommunications wavelengths were used. Furthermore, out system has strong robustness against thermal or mechanical fluctuations due to its cm-long coherence lengths."}
{"text":"\nWe present an interpretation of de Broglie-Bohm trajectories for entangled single particles that can be understood as local instead of non-local. By utilizing a \"locality loophole\" with a suitable choice of retarded wavefunctions, violations of Bell's Inequality can be observed without the need for inefficiency in the detectors. We study a potential experimental setup for massive two-particle single-state entanglement, and demonstrate that as long as the particles are not ultrarelativistic, this configuration will allow for localized de Broglie-Bohm trajectory interpretation. Furthermore, our research suggests a physical effect based on changing magnetic fields in an EPR Stern-Gerlach configuration, which would lead to a detector loophole for near-luminal particles and potentially close the locality loophole."}

With the potential to provide critical constraints on planet formation models, it is essential that the next generation of extrasolar searches include a comprehensive and well-funded microlensing component. Such surveys, when combined with complementary methods, can provide accurate insight into the frequency and properties of planets, especially of those that are low mass and terrestrial."}
{"text":"\nThis article focuses on NGC 7679, a Seyfert 2 galaxy that is both luminous and infrared. The co-existence of starburst and AGN activates maintain the ionization structure. As an X-ray source, it has a low column density of N_H < 4 x 10^20 cm^{-2}, ruling out the unified model of SyGs and suggesting the presence of a hidden Sy1 nucleus. In order to investigate the circumnuclear region, the [O III] 5007 emission line was utilized to examine the gas and ionization structure. The results showed an elliptical isophotes direction running along PA ~ 80 deg and the maximum of ionization by the AGN power-law continuum coincided with a displacement of ~ 13 arcsec eastward from the nucleus. The analysis led to the conclusion that the dust and gas facing the central AGN engine could lead to the decay of dust and star-formation in the region with [O III] luminosity > 10^41 erg s^{-1}."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate the collective behavior of stock prices in the National Stock Exchange (NSE) in India, an emerging market. Results indicate the presence of strong correlations in the movement of stock prices compared to those of established markets such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). This is attributed to the dominance of a common market mode which affects the stock prices. In contrast, the interactions between related stocks, such as those belonging to the same business sector, are found to be much weaker. This can be visualized by reconstructing the network of mutually interacting stocks, with a distinct lack of sector identity being explicitly shown. Spectral analysis of the cross-correlation matrix reveals that the few largest eigenvalues differ from those predicted by random matrix theory, but the number of such eigenvalues is much less relative to the NYSE. This is synthesized by modeling the stock price dynamics with a two-factor model and indicating that the building of an internal structure, comprised of multiple groups of strongly connected components, is a marker of market development."}
{"text":"\nThis study examines the morphologies of galaxies in the A901\/902 supercluster based on data from the COMBO-17 survey. Our sample consists of 570 galaxies whose photometric redshifts fall between 0.155 < z_phot < 0.185 and a visual classification of M_V=-18. We compare the morphological classifications to local galaxy density, distance from closest cluster centre, projected surface mass density, and photometric classification. We find evidence of a classic morphology-density relation at high local galaxy densities, as well as a correlation between morphology and local mass density. These indicate that the immediate environment has a more profound effect on galaxy morphology than global cluster properties. Additionally, after splitting the red sequence into two populations (old\/passive and young\/dusty), we find that galaxies with dusty environments are more likely to be intermediate between early and late-type galaxies, which suggests a transformation from field\/group spirals to S0 galaxies and ellipticals on the way to cluster accretion."}
{"text":"\nIn this article, we explore the compatibility between Frobenius splitting and the geometry of $G$-Schubert varieties in the context of an equivariant embedding $X$ of a connected reductive group $G$ over an algebraically closed field of positive characteristic. If $X$ is the wonderful compactification of a group of adjoint type, then $G$-Schubert varieties are the closures of Lusztig's $G$-stable pieces. Our objective is to prove that $X$ admits a Frobenius splitting which is compatible with all $G$-Schubert varieties, particularly when $X$ is smooth, projective, and toroidal. To this end, we demonstrate the stability of Frobenius splitting along ample divisors for any $G$-Schubert variety, thus indicating the presence of nice singularities. However, we also provide an example of a non-normal $G$-Schubert variety in the wonderful compactification of a group of type $G_2$, and extend the Frobenius splitting results to the more general class of $\\mathcal R$-Schubert varieties."}
{"text":"\nThis article examines the various approaches to treating outer boundaries in numerical relativity, testing them with a simple configuration of a Schwarzschild black hole with an outgoing gravitational wave perturbation. The numerical solutions of all different boundary treatments are compared to a 'reference' numerical solution generated at a huge radius, measuring the reflections caused by the artificial boundary. An improved boundary condition for the gauge degrees of freedom is introduced, along with other possibilities, such as freezing incoming characteristic fields, Sommerfeld boundary conditions, and the constraint-preserving boundary conditions of Kreiss and Winicour. Sponge layers and spatial compactification are also tested. In conclusion, the best treatment found involves the combined use of constraints preservation, the freezing of the Newman-Penrose scalar Psi_0, and control of gauge reflections."}
{"text":"\nThis paper investigates over 1200 close binary systems observed with the SDSS-I Data Release Five and seeks to find any magnetic white dwarf\nin these systems as they could be potential progenitors of Cataclysmic Variables. Surprisingly, only two of these binary systems are believed to contain magnetic white dwarfs with a magnetic field strength lower than 10 MG. To\nconfirm this result, further observations are needed. Finding these two candidate systems is encouraging given that the expected proportion of Cataclysmic Variables containing magnetic white dwarfs is approximately 25%.\nHowever, even if these were the first known detached magnetic white dwarf + M dwarf binaries, that would still not explain the discrepancy between the known Cataclysmic Variable population and the likely close binary progenitors."}
{"text":"\nIn this study, 47 gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) that were observed by Swift were analyzed spectrally and energetically. These GRBs all had redshift known, granting better insight into the details of their composition. To begin, models with two and three parameters were used to fit the narrow-range Swift-BAT 15-150 keV detected spectra. A careful analysis of errors and their correlations was done. Further, results from both the power law and cut-off power law models were studied. In addition, energies and their fluences in the rest-frame were calculated for those with the CPL model. This homogeneous sample was compared to the \u201cAmati\u201d relation among non-Swift GRBs, which showed significant correlation between the peak energy E'pk and the radiated energy Eiso. Lastly, a band model with power law index frozen to -2.3 fit was used to further compare to the \u201cAmati\u201d relation."}
{"text":"\nThrough our research, we shed light on the relationship between Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) laws, which describe the association between star formation rate and gas density, and the kinds of molecules used to trace the gas. We find that the KS law can differ depending on the critical density of the molecular line used, particularly in lines which are easily excited. High critical density lines can detect regions with similar properties regardless of galaxy type and therefore will display a linear correlation between line luminosity and star formation rate. Lower critical density lines detect areas in which the gas varies in different galaxies, leading to a star formation rate which escalates in greater proportion than the line luminosity. A model involving isothermal and homogenous molecular clouds helps to explain these differences, as well as shed light on why the far infrared and CO(1->0) and HCN(1->0) lines display different slopes. Our model even predicts that the IR-line luminosity link should fluctuate for galaxies whose median density equals the line critical density. This can be verified through observations of molecules such as HCO^+(1->0) with higher critical densities, or by HCN(1->0) observations of star-forming high redshift galaxies with very dense environments. Additionally, the irregularities seen in the HCN(1->0)-IR correlation at higher luminosities can be overwhelmingly linked to an unchanging star formation efficiency."}
{"text":"\nIn this article, we investigate the form factors for heavy-light pseudoscalar meson decays using partially quenched staggered chiral perturbation theory (\\schpt) to leading order in $1\/m_Q$, where $m_Q$ is the heavy quark mass. We examine these decays with the light meson in the final state conforming to the exact chiral symmetry of staggered quarks. Our approach and calculations are based on Becirevic, Prelovsek and Zupan's existing partially quenched continuum chiral perturbation theory, which we have extended to be applicable to the staggered, non-degenerate case. We evaluate the effects of the non-leading chiral terms, thereby obtaining a relationship between the coefficients governing the analytic valence mass dependence. These results can be used to analyze lattice computations of the form factors $B\\to\\pi$ and $D\\to K$ when the light quarks are simulated using the staggered action."}
{"text":"In this paper, we demonstrate an innovative density tensor hierarchy for open system dynamics, which can be used to restore information regarding fluctuations that are forgotten when transforming to the reduced density matrix. We analyze two cases: when fluctuations come from a classical probability distribution and when they come from a quantum system interacting with another quantum state. For each case, we helpfully explain the hierarchy through a concise generating function and discuss the expected trace properties. To demonstrate the classical probability distribution form, we look at a quantum system with It\\^o stochastic and jump process Schr\\\"odinger equations. Additionally, for the those involving a quantum environment, we look at collisional Brownian motion and weak coupling Born-Markov master equation for further evidence. Finally, we explore why a quantum system interacts with a quantum environment and the implications of Schr\\\"odinger equations reducing or not reducing the state vector."}
{"text":"\nA numerical study was conducted to investigate the nonlinear saturation of the r-mode instability and its effects on the spin evolution of Low Mass X-ray Binaries (LMXBs). By solving the equations for the three mode amplitudes in conjunction with the spin and temperature evolution equations, the system eventually reaches either a cyclic evolution with a frequency change of at most 10%, a full equilibrium state in which the accretion torque balances the gravitational radiation emission, or a thermogravitational runaway. Various sources of damping such as shear viscosity, hyperon bulk viscosity and boundary layer viscosity are considered, along with properties of the star like the hyperon superfluid transition temperature, the fraction of the star that is above the threshold for direct URCA reactions, and slippage factor. Results of the study suggest that for $\\nu > 700$ Hz the r-mode instability would be active for about 1 in 1000 LMXBs, and that only the gravitational waves from LMXBs in the local group of galaxies could be detected by advanced LIGO interferometers."}
{"text":"The present article examines the application of a quantum auction protocol in which superpositions are used to construct bids and distributed search is used to determine the winning bid(s). After measuring the final quantum state, the auction outcome is achieved while the superposition is destroyed. This feature keeps the non-winning bids hidden for information protection, like for situations where there are partnership bidding or external allocative concerns. The protocol is a valid choice for different types of auctions, whether first or second price, or ones involving single or multiple items. Our analysis of the protocol is done with a simple quantum sealed-bid auction and verifies how a proposed adiabatic search limits the potential of bidders to manipulate the system. The findings are significant as they emphasize how incentive instead of computational potential guides quantum algorithm selection."}

{"text":"This article reviews the progress of wide field surveys in astronomy and their use as the primary engine of discovery in mapping the sky. I review the major wide field surveys of the past two decades - 2MASS, SDSS, 2dfGRS, and UKIDSS - and the science they've allowed us to explore. I then look at upcoming projects that may contribute to future astronomical discoveries. Finally, I consider whether the exploration of survey discovery space has ended and assess other possible ways to extend astronomical discovery, including the use of time and the possibility of neutrino astrophysics."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate the resonance Na I D lines (D1: 5895.92 \\AA; D2: 5889.95 \\AA) in main sequence stars between F6 and M5.5 (B-V between 0.457 and 1.807) and [Fe\/H] between -0.82 and 0.6. Spectra were taken with a 2.15-m telescope at the CASLEO observatory, with periodic acquisition since 1999. Calibration in wavelength and flux was conducted with data that also enabled us to define a pseudo-continuum level and one for calibration purposes. The equivalent width of the D lines and their relation to the B-V colour index of the stars was evaluated. We compared our results to other studies, and created a spectral index (R_D') by dividing the flux in the D lines by the bolometric flux. This index can be used as an activity indicator in stars with higher levels of activity, and these results combined will also provide a method to calibrate in flux stars that do not have an established B-V colour index."}
{"text":"\nWe have studied the effects of maser emission originating from a thin, flat gaseous ring orbiting around a central mass, configured edge-on. The power law relation k=k0r^{-q}, which describes the absorption coefficient as a function of distance from the central mass, was used to calculate the Position-Velocity (PV) diagrams for various values of the exponent q. Our results unearthed significant differences in the PV diagrams depending on the value of q. In particular, the most intense maser features may originate from either the inner or outer rings of the amplifying object, or from the region nearest to the central mass, contrary to the commonly assumed scenario.  Our calculations indicate that, in the case of NGC 4258, a decreasing absorption coefficient with increasing radius of the amplifying ring is needed in order to generate strong maser emission at the ring's inner edge."}
{"text":"\nWe have used the Infrared Spectrograph on board the Spitzer Space Telescope to detect the 9.7 micrometer silicate absorption in a damped Lyman-alpha system at a redshift of 0.524 toward AO0235+164. The feature is observed to have a broad and shallow profile between 8-12 micrometers and appears to be > 15 sigma in significance in equivalent width. Our fitting of the feature with the silicate absorption profiles of amorphous olivine and diffuse Galactic interstellar clouds was successful. This is the first ever detection of silicate absorption in a DLA, which is approximately 2 times higher than the expected tau_{9.7} vs. E(B-V) relation for Galactic interstellar clouds. The further exploration of 9.7 micrometer silicate absorption in quasar absorbers will provide vital insight into the dust content in distant galaxies."}
{"text":"\nThrough a wide-field BVI photometry study of NGC 5466, we have detected the red giant branch bump for the first time. Our results demonstrate that the number of red giant stars (relative to those on the main sequence turnoff) is in good agreement with stellar models from the Yonsei-Yale and Teramo groups, more than expected by Victoria-Regina models. We further explore the cluster's dynamical history by evaluating its mass function and blue straggler frequency. Our findings show that NGC 5467 has a shallow mass function and significantly more concentrated blue stragglers in comparison to the horizontal branch or red giant branch stars. In addition, its specific frequency of blue stragglers places it on the frequency-cluster magnitude relation observed for other clusters. All of these results taken together provide clues to the dynamical history of the cluster."}
{"text":"\nIn this paper, we use numerical simulations to explore vortex configurations and pinning properties in superconductors with honeycomb and kagome pinning arrays. We find that a variety of novel vortex crystal states can be stabilized at integer and fractional matching fields. Moreover, these arrays possess notably sharper commensuration peaks in the critical depinning force than triangular arrays, and additional peaks are visible at non-integer matching fields. For instance, our simulations indicate that honeycomb pinning lattices present significantly superior matching effects at most fillings B\/B_\\phi=n\/2 than those of triangular lattices, which only robustly exhibit pronounced matching effects at integer fillings B\/B_\\phi=n. Additionally, the non-integer matching field peaks reveal the presence of dimer, trimer, and higher order vortex molecules forming \"vortex molecular crystals\" and \"vortex plastic crystals\". We also illustrate that kagome and honeycomb arrays can be used to boost the critical current above triangular ones."}
{"text":"\nRecent discoveries of Jovian-type planets in moderately close binary star systems have presented scientists with questions concerning the formation of giant planets and the potential for smaller planets in such complicated environments. As current detection methods are not yet efficient enough to find Earth-sized objects in binaries, the advancement of more sensitive techniques has raised the possibility of more planetary discoveries around these systems. Consequently, theoretical studies and numerical modeling of terrestrial and habitable planet formation are required to gain an understanding of the prevalence of life in these systems, and the knowledge obtained will provide important insights for NASA research and missions."}
{"text":"\nThis study examines the universality of compressing sequences produced by monotonic distributions. We demonstrate that for a monotonic alphabet of size $k$, the probability parameters need approximately $0.5 \\log (n\/k^3)$ bits to compress a sequence of length $n$, as long as $k$ is of order $n^{1\/3}$ or lower. We also show there is a subclass of monotonic distributions of infinite alphabets with a redundancy of $O(n^{1\/3+\\epsilon})$ bits. This subclass comprises rapidly decaying distributions, including 'integers' and geometric scenarios. For decaying scenarios that are not so fast, a reduction of $o(n)$ bits is achievable in particular distributions over integers. Our results are applicable to finite entropy monotonic distributions. Lastly, we observe that for sequences whose empirical distributions are monotonic, similar bounds for redundancy as those in the average case may be obtained. Even if an empirical distribution does not present monotonicity, the maximum likelihood description length is still ascertainable with diminishing individual sequence reductions."}
{"text":"\nThis paper investigates the influence of a $<\\bar{q}q>$ and $<qq>$ condensates on the energy of a system in 2D, 3D and 4D models that consist of massless fermions, two flavors and $N_c$ colors. An effective potential is employed in the mean-field approximation to investigate the ground state of these models. It has been established that for models to exist in a ground state with a pure $<\\bar{q}q>$, the ratio of the coupling constants ($G_S\/H_S$ in 2D and 4D or $G_S\/H_P$ in 3D) must be greater than $2\/N_c$, which is the ratio of the colors of the fermions that form the condensates. A decrease in the value of $G_S\/H_S$ or $G_S\/H_P$ has been seen to lead to differences between the models in terms of the coexistence of the two condensates, $<\\bar{q}q>$ and $<qq>$, and this is dependent on the model, as well as $N_c$ in the 3D model. A $G_S-H_S$ or $G_S-H_P$ phase diagram is given in the paper, which also suggests constraints on two-flavor QCD-NJL models."}
{"text":"\nIn this study, we have deployed a field assessment of the availability of SunOS\/Solaris Unix systems by utilizing logfiles from syslogd and wtmpx over a 4-year period from 373 workstations and servers. We applied the procedure to detect service outage from imperfect or incomplete data present in event logs. To address this, we gained additional information from wtmpx files which are maintained by the operating system. The findings from this study illustrates that the combined utilization of wtmpx and syslogd records provides more accurate availability estimations that are closer to reality."}
{"text":"\nWe have acquired IRAM Plateau de Bure interferometer data to examine the CO J=1-0 luminsosity present in the metal-poor compact dwarf I Zw 18, located within a 300 pc (FWHM) beam. This analysis has revealed that the CO content present within I Zw 18 is an order of magnitude lower than originally estimated, with an upper limit of 1 \\times 10^5K km s^-1 pc^2 (I_CO < 1 K km s^-1). Furthermore, comparison between I Zw 18 and nearby, low-mass irregulars such as NGC 1569, SMC and NGC 6822 has highlighted the low CO-to-H_2 ratio present, estimated to be \\sim 10^-2 times the galactic value. A 3mm continuum emission sourcee was detected during the observation which has been speculated to be due to either thermal dust or free-free emission."}
{"text":"Here, we present a binary model which proposes interactions between stars as a hypothesis for the source of the far-UV excess seen in elliptical galaxies, first observed by surprise in 1969. This model is derived from Han et al. (2002, 2003) and successfully displays the expected range of UV excesses in (1550-V) and (2000-V), as well as their redshift-driven evolution. Additionally, we offer colour-colour diagrams as useful diagnostic creators for studying elliptical galaxies. If the binary model holds true, then the UV excess is not linked to the age of the population, but rather exists as universally from dwarf ellipticals to giant ellipticals, regardless of the metallicity."}
{"text":"\nIn this article, we investigate how electron-electron interaction can affect spin relaxation premiated by phonons in quantum dots. We apply the Full Configuration Interaction approach to examine the spin-orbit coupling with Rashba and Dresselhaus couplings, and spins are effectively stabilized with the number of confined electrons, due to the spin-orbit admixture change arising from the electron-electron interaction. We further compare the simulations with recent tripled-singlet transition experiments conducted on GaAs dots with external magnetic fields. Our results are in agreement with the experimental findings, reinforcing the conjecture that spin-orbit coupling aided by phonon emission is the main cause of spin relaxation."}
{"text":"\nThis article explores the possibility of the recently discovered IntraDay Variability (IDV) source J1128+5925 exhibiting an annual modulation in its characteristic variability time-scale. To this end, the flux density of the source is monitored at 2.7-10.45GHz using the 100m Effelsberg and 25m Urumqi radio telescopes. We analyze the frequency and temporal behavior of the variability and investigate if the observed changes agree with modulation from the Earth's orbit. Comparison with predictions from scintillation theory indicate the observed frequency dependence of the IDV is consistent with interstellar scintillation. Models of anisotropic annual modulation are used to derive a lower limit to the distance of the scattering screen and an upper limit to the source size, which is verified by VLBI measurements. "}
{"text":"\nIn this article, we explore the structure of the substitutional Cr3+ ion situated in MgAl2O4 spinel. We conducted Cr K-edge Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) and X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure (XANES) spectroscopies, supplemented by first-principles computations of the structural relaxation and XANES spectrum. Our results revealed that the Cr-O distance is close to that in MgCr2O4 and displays full relaxation from its first neighbors, while the second shell of Al atoms only experience slight relaxation. This deviation from Vegard's law reveals the strain-induced bond buckling from Mg-centered tetrahedra around the Cr-centered octahedron, preserving the angle between the edge-sharing octahedra and the D3d symmetry of the B-site spinel structure."}
{"text":"\nThis paper looks into the dependability analysis and evaluation of a commercially available cache-based RAID storage system, which has complex overlapping error detection and recovery techniques. To model and analyze the architecture, three levels of abstraction were formed - cache architecture, cache operations, and error features. The simulation-based environment DEPEND was utilized to simulate faults, analyze detection mechanisms, and measure dependability merits. Fault models for cache components, disks, transmission errors, and data errors were configured. At each level, parameters such as system behavior under a real workload, coverage of detection mechanisms, and amount of errors accumulated in the cache and disks were analyzed and evaluated."}
{"text":"\nIn this study, the statistical properties of bibliometric indicators related to research performance, field citation density and journal impact among the 100 largest European universities were explored. We found a clear size-dependent cumulative advantage for the impact of universities in terms of total number of citations, which is a feature also found in research group level studies and hence suggesting it may be a pervasive property of the science system. Additionally, the fraction of uncited sources decreased considerably with size for lower-performance universities, but the average research performance was not diluted with size. For the lower-performance institutions, field citation density provided a strong cumulative advantage in citations per publication. It was also found that with increasing research performance, field citation density and journal impact, the fraction of self-citations decreased significantly."}
{"text":" This article aims to understand the origin of asymmetry witnessed in some BSNRs in the radio band. To do this, 3-D MHD simulations of a spherically expanding shock wave, both through a gradient of ambient density with a uniform magnetic field, and through ambient plasma density homogeneous media with a magnetic field strength gradient, are carried out. By synthesizing the synchrotron emissions from the simulations, parameters to quantify the degree of asymmetry of the remnants can be derived, and be used as a way to determine the microphysics of strong shock waves via comparison to observed data. The obtained results show that asymmetric BSNRs emerge when the line of sight is not aligned with the ambient density gradient or with the gradient of magnetic field strength. The article shows that asymmetric BSNRs with two limbs of different brightness can arise from a gradient of magnetic field strength perpendicular to the limbs, and converging arcs can be explained by gradients in between the two arcs."}
{"text":"\nThis article explores the pattern formation and evolution of unsynchronizable\ncomplex networks. Anomalous behavior emerges from this type of network due to its\nasymmetric topology, forming nonstationary patterns. It is observed that as the\ncoupling strength falls out of synchronization, on-off intermittency occurs, resulting in a\ngiant cluster that dominates the network along with several smaller clusters.\nPattern evolution is then characterized by the absorption or emission of the small clusters\nto or from the giant one. The gradual dissolution of the giant cluster into small\nparts is observed as the coupling strength moves away from the synchronization bifurcation\npoint. This study presents a dynamic and quantitative analysis of the nonstationary\npatterns, displaying newly revealed scalings and evidencing the independence of\ncertain active nodes from coupling strength yet sensitivity to bifurcation types.\nThese findings indicate further understandings of the dynamics of complex\nnetworks, as well as implications for resolving problems in which normal operation\nof the system relies on unsynchronizable states."}
{"text":"This study provides new information about the solar neighbourhood with the discovery and characterization of 33 previously unidentified white dwarf systems. Through the use of spectroscopy and photometry, we were able to effectively temperature and distance estimates, as well as discerning which type of model to use. Furthermore, eight of the systems are suspected to be within the NStars and Catalogue of Nearby Stars (CNS) horizons of 25 pc, potentially constituting a 18% increase in the nearby white dwarf sample. Trigonometric parallax determinations are also being made via CTIOPI on these 20 systems, providing further valuable insights. Particularly, one of the DCs was identified as especially cool with absorption in the near infrared and was shown to be most likely a mixed H\/He atmosphere white dwarf."}
{"text":"\nFor the first time, we apply nonlinear analysis to the analysis of Atomic Weights and Mass Number of atomic nuclei. Our investigations show the presence of nonlinear influence in the increase of mass in nuclei, potentially revealing chaotic behaviour.  Additionally, the analysis suggests a potential Power Law governing the growth of mass in atomic nuclei. Variogram analysis indicates the activity may be fractal, and the Hurst Exponent suggests the same growing mass behaviour is in the fractional Brownian regime. Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA) gives evidence of new recurrences, pseudoperiodicities, self-resemblances and self-similarities, with determinism values displaying varied stability during anatomic nucleus' escalating mass. The results of this analysis point to new regularities in atomic nuclei that need further exploration, particularly in regards to binding energy values using nonlinear methods."}
{"text":"\nWe investigated the dielectronic recombination (DR) of an Mg-like Fe XV species leading to an Al-like Fe XIV species by using the heavy-ion Test Storage Ring at the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics located in Heidelberg, Germany. Our measurements of resonance strengths and energies spanned an electron-ion collision energy range from 0 to 45 eV. Further theoretical calculations were carried out with the AUTOSTRUCTURE code in the multiconfiguration Breit-Pauli method. Comparing our experimental and theoretical results for electron-ion collision energies lower than 25 eV revealed poor agreement, whereas results for higher energies showed good agreement for resonance energies but for resonance strengths the theoretical resonance strengths were about 31% greater than the experimental values. Additionally, we observed that in the energy range above 42 eV, the detected Rydberg states' detection probabilities had a dependence on the nl. With our determined results, combined with the AUTOSTRUCTURE calculations, we formulated a Maxwellian-averaged 3 -> 3 DR rate coefficient that was estimated to be accurate to better than 29%, while considering a 90% confidence level. The new plasma rate coefficient was then compared to previously published theoretical results and was found to be smaller in the range of k_BT_e between 2.5-15 eV and variation of 19-28%."}
{"text":"\nWe analyzed a region of the sky centered on the WMAP cold spot and found a considerable dip in the surface brightness and number of extragalactic radio sources compared to the average values. This dip has structure on 1-10 degree scales and is, according to analyses of all-sky wavelets, likely related to the cold spot. This implies that physical structures, possibly situated at moderate redshifts, can explain the spot without requiring non-Gaussian processes at the last scattering surface of the CMB. If true, then a ~140 Mpc radius empty void at redshifts below 1 is necessary to cause the magnitude and angular size of the WMAP cold spot, posing tension to current concordance cosmological models."}
{"text":"\nThe GEMS and GOODS fields were studied up to a redshift of 1.4 to understand the morphologies of galaxy interactions and mergers. The observations revealed familiar features such as antennae with long tails, tidal dwarfs and double cores, M51-type galaxies with spiral arms and companions, early type galaxies with plumes, equal mass grazing collisions, and thick J-shaped tails with star formation. Additionally, one new type of system was observed, involving a loose assemblage of smaller galaxies. Photometric measurements and physical sizes of the observed objects were calculated, with the results showing that the tails and disks from GEMS and GOODS galaxies were much smaller than those seen in local galaxies. Furthermore, most of the tidal dwarfs were blue, suggesting that star formation may be caused by gravitational instabilities in the gas. Additionally, some of the star-forming regions on tidal arms were larger than those observed in the Milky Way, indicating that the gas column density and velocity dispersion may be greater in interacting galaxies."}
{"text":"This article examines the optimization of the energy landscape domain wall switching. Various approaches such as the use of multiple Stoner-Wohlfarth layers and continuum micromagnetics have been explored, with the end goal of minimizing the energy for concentration of magnetization. The stability and switching field are both important factors in reaching optimal results, as illustrated in a visualized plot of the energy depending on the value of the magnetic moment m_z. It is calculated that the potential figure of merit xi can reach no higher than 4. There is evidence of a quadratical anisotropic parameter that is proposed by Suess et al which was found to reach this limit."}
{"text":"\nIn this study, we assess the performance of the HARPS spectrograph in observing the radial velocities of a large collection of Solar-type stars (~1400) in order to discover low-mass\/extra-solar planets. Through our survey, a comprehensive analysis of the distribution of orbital elements pertaining to exoplanets has been conducted so that we have concrete evidence to make better predictions of planet formation models. Specifically, we present the HARPS data and the orbital solutions for 3 systems HD 100777, HD 190647 and HD 221287. Among those, HD 100777 contains a 1.1 M_Jup mass planetary companion on a 384-day, moderately eccentric orbit. The evolved star HD 190647 has been found to possess a 1.9 M_Jup planet with a lengthy 1038-day orbit. Lastly, HD 221287 has a 3.1 M_Jup planet on a 456-day orbit, however the shape of this particular orbit is uncertain due to the irregular residuals potentially caused by stellar activity."}

Using a diagrammatic approach for energy differences much larger than the energy spacing, we gain insight into the ensemble-averaged one and two particle Green's functions. Diffusons and Cooperons parts of the two-particle Green's function can be described by distinct scaling functions. Our investigation demonstrates that the superconducting transition temperature of an system with one interacting dot and one non-interacting dot in an orbital magnetic field can display a {\\it non-monotonic} behavior in the flux through the non-interacting dot. Further, the fluctuation magnetization above the critical temperature can also be nonmonotonic and can further be deduced by examining the cooperon scaling function."}
{"text":"\nYang's theorem indicates that $Z^0 \\to 2\\gamma$ is not permitted in any Poincar\\'{e}\ninvariant theory when considering bosonic photons with two-particle states transforming\naccording to the standard coproduct of the Poincar\\'{e} group. Nonetheless, a novel \nDrinfel'd twist of the coproduct has been proposed in noncommutative geometry. Using \ngeneral formulae, this paper demonstrates that this process is forbidden in either \nthe standard or the twisted coproduct of the Poincar\\'{e} group; this result is\nindependent of the conventions in quantum field theory. As an example, $Z^0 \\to \\nu + \\nu$\nis found to be prohibited under the same conditions, even if lepton number is not conserved.\nMoreover, more generally, any massive particle with odd spin that decays into two identical \nmassless particles of the same helicity is also disallowed irrespective of the coproduct."}
{"text":"\nThis paper confirms evidence for the Katz-Sarnak density conjecture, as many families of L-functions show agreement with the N -> oo scaling limits of eigenvalues near 1 of subgroups of U(N). We find that even for suitably restricted test functions, there can be family dependent lower order correction terms in the 1-level density, which have wide-ranging applications from the theory of excess rank to predicting the behavior of zeros near the central point. We also derive a more suitable explicit formula for GL(2) L-functions which facilitates making comparisons among various families. Notably, this expression shines light on differences in behavior seen by families whose Fourier coefficients follow different laws. We investigate a host of families of elliptic curves and uncover differing lower order corrections that are contingent upon the background features of the family such as complex multiplication, a forced torsion point, and non-zero rank over Q(T)."}
{"text":"\nThis article assesses the validity of the L-functions Ratios Conjecture concerning the 1-level density of the symplectic family of quadratic Dirichlet characters from even discriminants d, each of which is less than or equal to X. We calculate the lower order terms up to size O(X^{-1\/2 + epsilon}) and observe perfect agreement with the Conjecture for test functions supported in [-1\/3, 1\/3]. Regarding test functions supported in [-1, 1], we demonstrate agreement with the Conjecture up to O(X^{-epsilon}), where epsilon is an arbitrarily small value. Our results suggest that the Ratios Conjecture effectively predicts the lower order terms of the 1-level density in this case, and thereby affirms the universality of behavior."}
{"text":"\nWe examine the implications of string theory on the cosmological landscape, particularly the solutions that can be found to the field equations in the Salam-Sezgind six-dimensional supergravity. This models complements our observations of distant supernovae, primordial nucleosynthesis abundance and recent measurements of cosmic microwave background. We find that a quintessence field slowly rolling down its exponential potential is the driving force behind the present day de Sitter epoch. Additionally, a second modulus is a source of cold dark matter, which when fully saturated, leads to unacceptable deviations from cosmological data. Numerical studies show this can account for up to 7% of total cold dark matter. Further components of this model are de Sitter energy that is consistent with observation, variations in fine structure constant that are negligible, fifth-forces that are short-ranged and a Robertson-Walker universe with a steady expansion rate. We demonstrate all this can be seen in a ten-dimensional String theory context."}
{"text":"\nWe analyze the dependence of isophotal shapes of 847 early-type galaxies from the SDSS on a variety of parameters, such as their absolute B-band magnitude, dynamical mass, nuclear activity, and environment. Our study reveals a decrease in the number of disky galaxies as luminosity increases and provides consistent linear relations that accurately describe this trend. Additionally, we observe correlations between disky fraction and nuclear and environmental factors. Nonetheless, these correlations reveal no further predictive capacity beyond luminosity or mass when determining early-type galaxy isophotal shape."}
{"text":"\nWe present evidence that the dichotomy among early-type galaxies originates from hierarchical cosmic structure formation and is not driven by AGN feedback. Combining semi-analytical modelling with a large N-body simulation, we show that boxy galaxies are generated via mergers between progenitor galaxies with a mass ratio $n<2$ and a combined cold gas mass fraction $F_{\\rm cold}<0.1$. Our model accurately reproduces the observed fraction of boxy systems situated within a wide range of stellar luminosities and halo mass for both central galaxies and satellites. After accounting for stellar mass dependence, the characteristics of the most recent major merger of early-type galaxies proves to be independent from their halo mass. This supports the idea set forth in Pasquali et al. (2007) that a galaxy's isophotal shape is chiefly affected by its stellar mass. Furthermore, our model predicts that less than 10 percent of all early-type galaxies form in major mergers between two early-type galaxies, that more than 95 percent of all boxy early-type galaxies with stellar mass $M_* < 2 \\times 10^{10} h^{-1} \\Msun$ are satellites, and that roughly 70% of small mass early-type galaxies do not create supermassive black hole binaries in their last major merger. This may explain why low mass early-types have central cusps compared to the cores found in more massive galaxies."}
{"text":"We study the spin-1\/2 moments of Volborthite, a distorted Kagom\\'e lattice that is comprised of corner-sharing isosceles triangles with exchange constants $J$ and $J'$. We demonstrate that the large amount of frustration on the lattice remains despite the distortion, causing its classical ground state degenerancy to grow exponentially with the system's perimeter. To examine the effects of thermal and quantum fluctuations, we introduce two complementary approaches with the goal of lifting the degeneracy. In the low temperature limit, an effective chirality Hamiltonian is derived from non-linear spin waves, which predicts a transition from a $\\sqrt 3 \\times \\sqrt 3$ type order to a new ferrimagnetic wave state with a doubly stretched unit cell at a certain value of $J'\/J$. This result is further confirmed by the application of a large-N approximation on the O($n$) model. The quantum limit of spin 1\/2 is studied through the exact diagonalization of small systems, and results correlate well with those seen in intermediate temperature experiments. Additionally, our research provides a basis for the suggestion that the spin-frozen state seen in NMR experiments is related to the disconnected ground states on the lattice."}
{"text":"\nWe review a sample of 18 flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs), 6 low-frequency peaked BL Lac objects (LBLs) and 2 high-frequency peaked BL Lac objects (HBLs) that were observed multiple times and bright enough during a 9-year span with the Energetic Gamma-Ray Experiment Telescope (EGRET) on the Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory for a spectral analysis. Our study does not detect any clear pattern in the variation of spectral index with flux for most sources, although certain sources did exhibit a hardening trend in their spectrums when the flux increased. Additionally, we did find evidence for a flux-hardness anti-correlation at low fluxes in five blazars. We compared the results of our analysis to various inverse Compton mechanisms to explain them. Our method fused EGRET skymaps with changes in performance observed during the mission. We also observed a previously unreported spectral hysteresis of weekly timescales in the FSRQs that experienced flares lasting 3-4 weeks, which all displayed counterclockwise rotation."}
{"text":"\nThis paper introduces VErsatile SPectral Analysis (VESPA): an algorithm designed to \naccurately model star formation and metallicity histories of galaxies using only \nspectroscopic data.

{"text":"\n\nThe fourth science run of LIGO and GEO 600 was conducted from early 2005 and collected data with significantly reduced noise compared to earlier versions. This paper investigates if any short-lived gravitational-wave burst signals with arbitrary waveforms were detected from all three LIGO interferometers in the 64-1600 Hz frequency range, via the use of signal consistency tests, data quality cuts and auxiliary-channel vetoing. After 15.5 days of observation, no gravitational-wave signals were identified and a 90% confidence upper limit of 0.15 burst events per day with amplitudes large enough to be detected was set. Simulations of this search illustrate its improved sensitivity, as well as give a general idea on the distances needed to detect representative supernova and binary black hole merger signals with 50% efficiency."}
{"text":"\nWe present a novel semi-numerical procedure to generate realistic representations of high redshift halo and ionization distributions, combining an excursion-set approach and first-order Lagrangian perturbation theory applied directly to linear density and velocity fields. This method will dramatically outpace the current practical limit of N-body codes in terms of dynamic range, allowing a greater accuracy in reionization studies due to better resolution. We compare the resulting halo and HII bubble distributions from our approach with those from N-body simulations and radiative transfer and find extremely good agreement. We also asses the size distributions of ionized and neutral regions, as well as power spectra of 21-cm brightness temperature fluctuations, and find them to be in line with previous predictions. We also include results based on a simulation of our semi-numerical approach run on absolutely the largest dynamic range to date, that of a 250 Mpc box with the capacity to resolve halos with a mass M >~ 2.2 x10^8 M_sun. This clearly highlights the importance of such a large scale to accurately model the late stages of reionization. Our semi-numerical approach offers increased speed and dynamic range which will be invaluable in the modeling of early structure formation and reionization."}
{"text":"\nIn our recent IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer observations of M51, the Seyfert 2 galaxy, we found two distinct molecular gas features on either side of the nucleus. These features are not associated with the previously believed rotating disk, but instead were found to exhibit velocity gradients, suggesting that the molecular gas near the active nucleus is being disturbed by a powerful jet. Our observations suggest that the molecular gas could be a result of either a rotating gas disk that the jet is interacting with, gas flowing into the nucleus, or a combination of the two. The high resolution images at sub-arcsecond scales provide insight into a more complex structure of the nuclear region of M51 that was not previously understood."}
{"text":"\nIn this study, we investigate the optical spectra of nine cataclysmic binary stars, mainly dwarf novae, with the main purpose of ascertaining their orbital periods. We provide the periods - LX And, 0.1509743(5) d; CZ Aql, 0.2005(6) d; LU Cam, 0.1499686(4) d; GZ Cnc, 0.0881(4) d; V632 Cyg, 0.06377(8) d; V1006 Cyg, 0.09903(9) d; BF Eri, 0.2708804(4) d; BI Ori, 0.1915(5) d; and FO Per, for which Porb is either 0.1467(4) or 0.1719(5) d. Several of the stars grant insight into features of interest beyond determining their orbital period - BF Eri presents both a large proper motion and space velocity, indicating it belongs to the halo population; CZ Aql displays strong-winged emission lines indicating a magnetically-channeled accretion flow; and the period of V1006 Cyg places it within the 2-3 hour gap in the distribution of orbital periods."}
{"text":"\nWe conducted an empirical study examining the Sun's displacement from the Galactic plane (z_\\odot) using three analytical methods. Our sample comprised of 537 young open clusters (YOCs) with an age logarithm of less than 8.5 and located within a heliocentric distance of 4 kpc, as well as 2030 OB stars observed up to a distance of 1200 pc and possessing distance information. We split the members of the Gould Belt into statistical subsections before analyzing z_\\odot for variation in line with different maximum values in the heliocentric distance and perpendicular distance to the Galactic plane. The z_\\odot for YOCs averaged between 13 and 20 pc, whilst for OB stars it fluctuated between 6 and 18 pc. There was a conspicuous inconsistency in the z_\\odot from the OB star analysis due to different limit values, while no such effect was noticed utilizing YOCs. Additionally, we identified scale heights of 56.9(+3.8)(-3.4) pc and 61.4(+2.7)(-2.4) pc for the distributions of YOCs and OB stars respectively."}
{"text":"\nUsing numerical methods such as strong-disorder renormalization group, exact diagonalization, and quantum Monte Carlo, we explore the particular features of the average time-independent correlation function in random antiferromagnetic XXZ spin-1\/2 chains, observing that it follows a power-law with a universal (disorder-independent) exponent \\eta=2. The investigation of the correlation function's prefactor revealed nonuniversal (disorder dependent) values \\upsilon_o and \\upsilon_e when computed for the longitudinal axis, yet a universal combination \\upsilon_o + \\upsilon_e equals -1\/4. Furthermore, the relation between the average correlation function and the average entanglement entropy, which has been proven to have a universal amplitude, exhibits nonuniversal features in its surface terms. We study the implications of this result in the context of the structure factor, which scalings interestingly depend on the correlation prefactors."}
{"text":"\nSIM PlanetQuest is the most promising near-term approach to finding and measuring masses and three-dimensional orbits of habitable planets around nearby solar-type stars. Numerous committees of the National Research Council as well as NASA Roadmaps have testified that this is the only program that can detect and confirm rocky planets in the habitable zones of star systems located 25 parsecs away or less. This also makes it the only technique that is currently capable of producing follow-up data from other methods such as space-based spectroscopy and ground-based interferometry."}
{"text":"\nBy utilizing infrared (IR) observations combined with spectra data of over 400 galaxies, we examine MS 1054-03, a galaxy cluster located at z=0.83. Through the selection of 19 cluster members spectroscopically, and an additional 15 cluster members via photometric redshifts, we were able to complete the IR luminosity function of the cluster. Our findings indicate a substantial evolution of the cluster's IR luminosity compared to similar-mass clusters like Coma. Additionally, the rate of this evolutionary change is correlative with the declining cosmic star formation rate (SFR) in certain environments, which may be due to the consumption of gas fuel. After factoring in the selection bias of the mass, we observe a mass-normalized integrated SFR within 0.5R_200 in MS 1054-03 evolving at a rate unlike lower redshifts. Furthermore, the study concludes that, contrary to some beliefs, these clusters are not simply formed as a result of star-forming galaxies absorbed from the surrounding regions, but rather, they contain an ample amount of gas and their star formation is potentially enhanced by the surrounding environment."}
{"text":"\nThis paper investigates the challenge of designing the topology of a sensor network to optimise the rate at which average consensus is obtained given the uncertainties in communication failures or errors, power and data rate limits or constraints, and the SNR of links. We show how this problem can be modelled as a constrained convex optimisation and can be solved using semidefinite programming, and demonstrate through extensive numerical research how the optimal topology design can improve the speed of consensus algorithm to approach the performance of a non-random network, but with a significantly lower communication cost. Necessary and sufficient conditions for mss and almost sure convergence of average consensus when links fail are established in the paper, and a pivotal role for the algebraic connectivity of the mean graph in determining such convergence is also highlighted."}
{"text":"We have conducted simultaneous Swift XRT\/UVOT and REM monitoring of the blazar PKS0537-441 during late 2004 through November 2005. The BAT monitored the source 2.7 Ms recurrently, the XRT and UVOT pointed it 7 times for a total of 67 ks, making it one of the AGNs best monitored by Swift. In January-February 2005, PKS0537-441 was detected brighter than usual; both the X-rays and optical (VR, IR and I bands) recorded a factor of two and 60, respectively, higher than in December 2004. By July, however, the source dropped to a much fainter state in X-rays. The REM observed a high optical state at this time, but slightly dimmer than in January-February. When November arrived, both X-ray and optical light returned to a quiescent state, having decreased by a factor of 4 and 60, respectively. The variability in both X-rays and optical is highly correlated on a long-term time scale, but days- or hours-long observations do not show an evident connection between them. This presents an interesting opportunity for the investigation of jet activity. The spectral energy distribution is explained by considering the synchrotron and inverse Compton radiation from the jet, which is dissipated depending on the distance from the central engine."}
{"text":"\nOur follow-up observations of the Magnetic Cataclysmic Variable object HS 0922+1333 have revealed that the object is in fact synchronous, with its orbital and spin period both equal to 4.04 hours. Originally observed in a survey of low accretion rate polars, Suspicions were raised that the object might be asynchronous, leading to a disparity between its presumed orbital and spin period -- an unusual occurrence. Through our investigations of simultaneous spectoscopic and photometric observations spanning several years, our results show what was originally thought to be a discrepancy in period was actually a high velocity component of emission line arising from the stream of matter leaving the L1 point."}
{"text":"This paper examines the origin of the concept of gravitational lensing as proposed by Einstein. Through a historic review of Einstein's notebooks in 1912 and a letter from 1915, it is suggested that the idea of the phenomenon of new stars being the result of gravitational lensing was taken more seriously by Einstein in the fall of 1915 than was previously thought. Calculations by Einstein indicate that around the time of his first meeting with Erwin Freundlich in April 1912, Einstein began considering gravitational lensing, likely inspired by the appearance of Nova Geminorum 1912 (DN Gem) in March of that year. The implications of Einstein's investigation of gravitational lensing in 1915 for his development of the theory of general relativity is also addressed."}
{"text":"\nThe tremendous potential of MIMO technology to increase channel capacity and network performance has resulted in its wide adoption for mesh networks. In this study, we investigate the use of \"dirty paper coding\" (DPC) in Gaussian vector broadcast channels as power allocation for MIMO-based mesh networks. To optimize the performance of the network, we solve a non-convex problem by transforming the original problem and exploiting the channel duality. We present an efficient solution procedure that leverages Lagrangian dual decomposition method, conjugate gradient projection method, cutting-plane method, and subgradient method. Our numerical example significantly improves network performance with a gain of 34.4% compared to using standard power allocation schemes."}
{"text":"\nThis investigation provides criteria for the selection of optimal target events preferable for planetary lensing follow-up observations. We evaluated the probability of detecting planetary signals depending on the observables of the lensing magnification and the source brightness. The probability increases with magnification, with a higher rate occurring at moderate magnifications of $A\\lesssim 20$. Furthermore, a higher probability was also seen with brighter source stars, even at magnifications as low as $A\\sim 5$. However, detections of low mass planets ($q \\lesssim 10^{-4}$) become harder with giant stars with magnifications of $A\\gtrsim 70$. Therefore, it is recommended to search for the brightest stars and highest magnifications among alerted events."}
{"text":"This paper investigates the role of magnetic fields in protoplanetary discs and examines how the magnetic diffusivity, the process that enables magnetic fields to couple to the major matter component, is affected by the presence of dust grains. It discusses the ionization equilibrium and magnetic diffusivity as a function of height from the disc midplane at radii of 1 and 5 AU. Due to the weak ionization of protoplanetary discs, dust grains can suppress magnetic coupling by absorbing electrons and ions from the gas and substantially reducing the conductivity. However, if and when the grains grow sufficiently large, the magnetic fields are able to begin coupling to the gas and the Hall effect dominates the diffusion. Results suggest that the entire disk thickness becomes active once grains have aggregated to 1 micron in size at 5 AU."}
{"text":"\nWe present a new analysis of timing and X-ray spectral data from PSR J1930+1852, the energetic young pulsar located at the centre of the non-thermal supernova remnant G54.1+0.3. Using data from the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer and Chandra X-ray observatories, we tracked the period of the 136 ms pulsar over a 6-year span. We observed strong timing noise and\/or glitch activity, deviating from the expected spin-down rate of $\\dot P = 7.5112(6) \\times 10^{-13}$ s s$^{-1}$. The X-ray emission showed a high degree of pulsation, modulated by 71%, with an asymmetrical pulse shape. The high energy flux sits at $1.7 \\times 10^{-12}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ and has a photon index of 1.2\u00b10.2, making it harder than the unpulsed component.

{"text":"\nThis paper explores whether cosmogenic neutrinos can shed light on the distinction between two theories that explain the ankle, which is a break in the the spectrum of cosmic rays at around 10$^{19}$ eV: one {\\it ankle-transition scenario}, which interprets the ankle as the transition from Galactic to extragalactic cosmic rays, and the other is the {\\it proton-dip scenario}, where the dip is the result of pair production on the cosmic microwave background radiation. Furthermore, we consider the practicality of the near-future detection of cosmogenic neutrinos with several detectors. Using plausible physical parameter sets to calculate the fluxes of cosmogenic neutrinos following both scenarios, we found important features which could be utilised to determine which of the two theories is favored. For example, the neutrino flux at $\\sim 10^{20}$ eV increases significantly in the ankle-transition scenario as long as the maximum energy of cosmic rays at the source is adequate, while a characteristic peak at $\\sim 10^{16}$ eV is expected in the proton-dip scenario if extragalactic protons contribute significantly to the observed cosmic rays down to $10^{17}$ eV. Hence, we conclude that cosmogenic neutrinos can provide a clue to judge which of the two most likely scenarios is favored; unless of course, these features are masked by the potential presence of background neutrinos from other sources such as AGN and GRB's. Additionally, we found an interesting feature that the flux of cosmogenic neutrinos at $\\sim 10^{18}$ eV is exclusively determined by the cosmological evolution of cosmic ray sources; this means cosmogenic neutrinos with this energy could potentially give information on the cosmological evolution of the sources of ultra-high energy cosmic rays. Finally, comparing the fluxes of cosmogenic neutrinos with the expected sensitivity curves for multiple neutrino detectors, we determine that detection of cosmogenic neutrinos in the near future is attainable."}
{"text":"This article discusses the relationship between daemons and celestial mechanics as it pertains to the DAMA\/NaI experiment which observed the maximum signal in the May-June period. It suggests that this maximum is caused by a trail of daemons that become elongated orbits as the Sun moves, falling on the Earth with a velocity of 30-50 km\/s. These daemons are observed in the St. Petersburg experiment and their half-year periodicity is caused by their crossing of the outer reaches of the Sun which capture them. Consequently, celestial mechanics calculations corroborated with observations have produced a cross-section of daemon interaction with the solar matter to be ~1e-19 cm2."}
{"text":"\nWe explore the implications of having an extra matter sector present at low energies coming from orbifold constructions of the E_8 x E_8 Heterotic Superstring. Using the Fayet-Iliopoulos breaking, the model predicts the existence of three families of Higgses, and vector-like colour triplets, whose presence may help resolve the disparity between the unification scale predicted by the Heterotic Superstring (g_{GUT}x5.27x10^{17} GeV) and the value deduced from LEP experiments (2x10^{16} GeV). Additionally, by introducing the three Higgs families, a satisfactory pattern of fermion masses and mixing angles can be achieved at the renormalizable level through the modification of the Yukawa couplings. While this has its advantages, it may also give rise to flavour-changing neutral currents. We address this potential issue as well, concluding that viable scenarios can be achieved for a reasonable light Higgs spectrum."}
{"text":"\nObservations from the Submillimeter Array, the VLA and the Spitzer Space Telescope have revealed evidence for the formation of a massive protocluster in S255N. Mid-infrared and radio images have outlined a cometary UCHII region, and the 1.3mm continuum data has shown that the region hosts three compact dust cores that have estimated masses between 6 to 35 Msun. Mid-infrared point sources are lacking which suggests an early evolutionary phase for the area. Moreover, there is a 4.5 micron linear feature emanating from SMA1, which could indicate the presence of an outflow from the region's protostar. These observations point to S255N being in the midst of forming a cluster of intermediate to high-mass stars."}
{"text":"\nIn this study, ultrafast electron nanocrystallography is used to assess the dynamic size variation of Au nanoparticles (2-20 nm) supported on a molecular interface. Results show that, upon photoinduced melting, the nanocrystals are driven to a non-equilibrium transformation, characterized by the initial lattice deformations, nonequilibrium electron-phonon coupling, and collective bonding and debonding. Reciprocally, the recrystallization process follows an opposite behavior - the hot lattice is formed from the liquid and then undergoes a thermal contraction. It is observed that the degree of structural change and thermodynamics of melting vary with the size of the nanoparticles."}

To enhance the understanding derived from these data, the project includes the development of SBF models based on Simple Stellar Population (SSP) characteristics, specifically adapted to this purpose.

{"text":"\nThis article presents a phenomenological theory for describing the spin excitations for two types of cuprate superconductors - La-based (e.g., La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$) and Y-based (e.g., YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_y$). By considering the Fermi surface topology, the d-wave superconductivity, and the spin-stripe order, we explain the results from inelastic neutron scattering experiments on these materials. We observe that in the superconducting state of YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_y$, a sharp resonance peak appears at a frequency of 40 meV, followed by the development of incommensurate peaks at lower and higher frequencies. In the normal state, no resonant excitation appears and the IC peaks merge into commensurate ones. For La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$, however, the situation is significantly different. The resonance peak is absent due to the decreasing of the superconducting gap and the presence of possible spin-stripe order, while the spectra is only enhanced at the expected resonance frequency (around 18meV) and incommensurate still. Moreover, a frequency scale at the frequency 55 meV is also demonstrated, showing that the spectra is commensurate and has a local maximum at this frequency. We provide an overall understanding of the spin excitations in Y-based and La-based cuprates to aid further research in this field."}
{"text":"\nTo assess environmental dielectric screening effects on exciton transition energies in single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs), immersion of SWNTs bridged over trenches in organic solvents with varying dielectric constants (from 1.0 to 37) was measured through photoluminescence and excitation spectroscopies. Conduction and valence band energies were observed to have a redshift of several tens of meV when the dielectric constant increased. This trend was observed without an indication of significant ($n$,$m$) dependence. The $\\epsilon_{\\rm env}$ small-power law dependence of both $E_{11}$ and $E_{22}$ energies was expressed as $E_{\\rm ii} = E_{\\rm ii}^{\\infty} + A\\epsilon_{\\rm env}^{-\\alpha}$, and could be accounted to repulsive electron-electron interaction. After a sample was immersed in sodium-dodecyl-sulfate solution, thereby wrapping the nanotube with surfactant, an additional shift to the ($2n+m$)-family pattern was observed. The data agreed well with Weisman's data, and was close to that of a dielectric constant of 2."}

Corrections to the partition function for finite N are further discussed in terms of specific symmetric group characters and their BPS counterparts. The investigation into this system is also extended to account for single-boson fundamental fields, with explicit counting of multi-trace quarter BPS operators in free \\N=4 super Yang Mills, for both large and finite N. Furthermore, the partition function for BPS operators in the chiral ring of \\N=4 super Yang Mills is analysed in terms of plane partitions, and the asymptotic counting of BPS primary operators with differing R-symmetry charges evaluated for free \\N=4 super Yang Mills and the chiral ring. Lastly, general explicit expressions are derived for SU(2) gauge theory partition functions with fundamental fields in the adjoint representation and in the context of free field theory."}
{"text":"\nIn this paper, we analyze the thermal Casimir force that acts between two dielectrics and one dielectric and one metal plate. We derive the low-temperature behavior of the Casimir free energy, pressure and entropy in the case of two real dielectric plates, and prove that for dielectrics that possess a finite static dielectric permittivity, the Nernst heat theorem is satisfied. It is shown that a dielectric plate's nonzero dc conductivity brings about a violation of the Nernst heat theorem and is thus not associated with dispersion forces. Furthermore, we derive the low-temperature asymptotics of the Casimir free energy, pressure and entropy between one metal and dielectric plate consistent with thermodynamics if the dielectric has a finite static dielectric permittivity. We also evaluate the experimental and theoretical results related to the Casimir interaction between metal and semiconductor with different charge carrier density, and put forward the idea that the conventional Lifshitz theory considering only the frequency dispersion is the most reliable means of interpreting present experiments."}
{"text":"This article examines the observable implications of a dark matter field fluid model's predictions of cosmological redshift, a cosmological phenomenon that relies on the combination of the velocity of the emitter and the distance the observed is from the emitter. The influence of speed on the intensity of light emitted, if the emitter moves away from the observer, will result in a redshift. In that same instance, a redshift, blueshift or no shift will be observed when the speed v is in range of c(exp[-beta*D]-1) < v < 0, v equals to c(exp[-beta*D]-1), or v is less than c(exp[-beta*D]-1), respectively. The redshift constant beta, of the dark matter field fluid, was concluded to be in the range of 10^(-3) ~ 10^(-5)\/Mpc based on the observation of redshifts and blueshifts in relation to distance. Ultimately, it can be deduced from the redshift effect of the dark matter field fluid that the geometry (size and shape) of all photons is consistent among inertial reference frames and that there is no length contraction effect."}
{"text":"\nOver the past three decades, researchers have studied the influence of previous and current generations of stars in cool star and planet formation. Investigations have revealed that cool star formation may be most affected in embedded clusters, where large numbers of cool stars form near hot OB stars. This paper surveys findings from a Cool Stars 14 session which considered how environment affects the formation of cool stars and associated planetary systems, with a specific focus on regions of high heat intensity. It examines the typical environments in which cool stars form, the effects that hot stars have on cool star formation, the impact environment has on planet formation, the role of hot star winds and supernovae, as well as the environment in which the Sun formed. It seeks to determine areas of both consensus and disagreement among current research on these topics."}
{"text":"This article studies the suggestion that interactions between a rotating bar in the baryonic disk and the dark matter halo density in the centers of galaxies could be revealed through N-body simulations. My results indicate that the continuity of the outcome is not affected by the typical amount of particles used in the simulations and that field and grid methods can produce the same results. Furthermore, I provide reasons as to why Weinberg & Katz's suggested particle number is more than necessary."}
{"text":"\nThis article assesses charmless 3-body decays of B mesons employing the factorization approach and heavy meson chiral perturbation theory (HMChPT). The momentum dependence of nonresonant amplitudes is assumed to be in the form of an exponential expression, such that its HMChPT results are maintained in a soft meson limit. Furthermore, the authors identify a major source of nonresonant signals in the matrix elements of scalar densities, such as $<K\\bar K|\\bar ss|0>$, which can be gleaned from the decay $\\bar B^0\\to K_SK_SK_S$ or $B^-\\to K^-K_SK_S$. The results of vector meson contributions to 3-body decays are described with the Breit-Wigner formalism. Concluding results indicate that all KKK modes are largely dominated by nonresonant backgrounds and other subsequent decay modes are subject to a potential tree pollution, resulting in elevated direct CP asymmetries. Additionally, the nonresonant contributions found in $K^-\\pi^+\\pi^-$ and $\\bar K^0\\pi^+\\pi^-$ modes agree with the Belle measurements, yet prove to be more substantial than those of the BaBar result."}
{"text":"This article discusses the role of the axiom of choice in quantum measurement, proposing that conscious observers select the outcome from a mixed state. Furthermore, the implications for a periodically repeating universe and notions of free will are proposed. In addition, a connection is proposed between Cantor's original definition of a set and the psychology binding problem. The article also examines the effect of consciousness on material outcomes through quantum processes, deriving interesting constraints, including the potential for a neuro-biological version of the quantum zeno effect. Lastly, the article suggests a hypothesis wherein a micro-mini black hole in the brain acts as a space-time interface between consciousness and the brain and is the source of mass-loss in the moment of death."}
{"text":"\nAn investigation of the jet structure of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) can be done\nwith the steep-decay phase of their early X-ray afterglow, based on the effects\nobserved by the X-ray Telescope onboard Swift. A Monte Carlo method is used to\ncalculate the decay index distribution of the GRB tail emission for different\nmodels. We propose new definitions, for the time of zero and the interval to be\nfitted, which allow us to come up with an exclusive definition of the decay\nindex and identify the jet structure. The results demonstrate that if the jet\nstructure has a core-envelope structure, the obtained distribution of the decay\nindex will be broad and have more than one peak. Consequently, if the decay\nindex for a certain event is below 2, we can rule out both uniform and Gaussian\njet models."}
{"text":"\nThis paper examines the excitation properties of the spin-1\/2 anisotropic XXZ Heisenberg chain through renormalization-group theory. As part of the investigation, the specific heat and spin-spin correlations are computed in the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic regions across all temperature and anisotropy ranges, producing a comprehensive description of the results. Various features of purely quantum nature are revealed, such as in the anti-ferromagnet, the specific heat peak value is resistant to variations in anisotropy, with temperatures decline when introduced with the Ising or XY anisotropy. On the other hand, in the ferromagnetic chain the peak value and temperature increases with the introduction of either type of anisotropy. Further, this work examines the spin-wave to spinon crossover determined by the excitation gap in the Ising-like ferromagnetic spectrum."}
{"text":"\nWe carry out an in-depth study of degenerate saddle point problems, which are viewed as extreme cases of the standard mixed formulations of symmetric problems with large jumps in coefficients. Our analysis demonstrates that this type of problem is well-posed in a standard norm despite the degeneracy. To this end, we apply the classic Ladygenskaya--Babu\\v{s}ka--Brezzi (LBB) or inf--sup condition alongside the standard coercivity condition and investigate how they are affected by the degeneracy of the corresponding bilinear forms. We formulate and explore amended conditions suitable for the degenerate nature of the problem, and show that the LBB or inf--sup condition is necessary and sufficient for well-posedness with respect to the Lagrange multiplier under certain conditions. Additionally, we demonstrate the necessity and sufficiency of a generalized coercivity condition for the primary unknown with respect to other conditions. We also connect the generalized coercivity condition to the positiveness of a relative subspace gap, and present various equivalent expressions for this gap. As our results offer proof of the uniform well-posedness of this class of problem in a standard norm, independent of the jumps magnitude, they have implications for fields such as the numerical modeling of composite materials produced from components with varying properties."}
{"text":"\nIn this paper, we analyze the probability of detecting planets in globular clusters based on their metallicities. We find that planets of low metallicity stars usually do not occupy small orbital distances. When considering the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2, the dependance of planetary system properties on metallicity becomes evident: high metallicity systems show a clustered distribution at high and low values of Ie with a sparsely populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2, while low metallicity systems are mainly concentrated in the higher range of Ie with a tail extending to lower values. This implies that while planets may exist in globular clusters, they are likely to be scarce and likely have orbital periods exceeding 10 days. We also discuss the implications of this on the roles that companions can play in the evolution of their parent stars in globular clusters, e.g. affecting the distribution of horizontal branch stars in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram and contributing to the formation of low-mass white dwarfs."}
{"text":"\nIn this article, we explored the possibilities for the emergence of Majorana masses for neutrinos in orientifolds of string theory, with MSSM-like spectra. We conducted a systematic search for supersymmetric type II Gepner orientifold models, admitting such instanton-induced Majorana masses, as well as other lepton- and baryon-violating operators. We investigated zero mode properties of D-brane instantons in general type II orientifold compactifications, and discovered that for the Majorana mass inducing instantons, only those with O(1) symmetry possess the necessary two zero modes. Further developments, such as the addition of fluxes and\/or non-perturbative extensions of the orientifolds, may enable instantons with Sp(2) and U(1) symmetries to be incorporated. We investigated orientifolds with MSSM-like spectra, but were unable to identify any models with O(1) instantons that fulfil the zero mode requirements. We did, however, find a number of models with Sp(2) instantons that can induce Majorana masses, in one particular orientifold of the Gepner model $(2,4,22,22)$. This also means that there is an automatic R-parity conservation, as well as a convenient flavour structure in the Majorana mass matrices. In addition, we presented a few more examples of orientifold models when less stringent constraints on the zero modes are applied."}
{"text":"This paper examines the influence of vacuum energy on the boundaries of quantum field theories. It is shown that a variety of conditions such as Neumann, Dirichlet, pseudoperiodic and quasiperiodic boundary conditions can be fixed points in a renormalization group flow. The study then goes further to investigate how massless bosonic free fields are affected by conformal invariance. It is then demonstrated that only Neumann boundary conditions are infrared-stable fixed points, and all other conformal invariant boundary conditions become unstable under certain relevant perturbations. In finite volumes, the dependence of the vacuum energy on the trajectories of the renormalization group flow is studied, offering an interesting perspective on dark energy evolution. Lastly, it is stated that the renormalization group flow on the boundaries does not affect the leading behaviour of the entanglement entropy of the vacuum in one-dimensional conformally invariant bosonic theories."}
{"text":"\n\nThe inclusion of higher harmonics could dramatically expand the range of supermassive black holes that can be observed with Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), which would be otherwise undetectable with only the dominant harmonic of the inspiral waveform. Our calculations suggest that we could observe black hole coalescences with total masses of up to $\\sim 10^8 M_\\odot$ (and mass-ratio 0.1) at a distance of 3 Gpc. Such an increase in LISA's mass reach is particularly significant for astrophysical applications as it provides an opportunity to observe black holes in a mass range for which there is significant observational evidence."}
{"text":"This paper offers an extended analysis of I. I. Guseinov's work on one-range addition theorems for the Coulomb interaction potential and its derivatives. Through the use of previously derived one-range addition theorems for the Yukawa potential with limit $\\beta \\to 0$, Guseinov aimed to understand the function $f (\\bm{r} \\pm \\bm{r}')$ in terms of products of functions depending on either $\\bm{r}$ or $\\bm{r}'$, similar to the famous Laplace expansion of the Coulomb potential. Although Guseinov's approach looks promising, it is found that his conclusions are mathematically questionable and in some cases fundamentally flawed. It is demonstrated that the one-center limit of Guseinov's rearranged Yukawa addition theorems, as well as other addition theorems, do not exist, and the Coulomb potential does not belong to any of the Hilbert spaces used. Therefore, one-range addition theorems for the Coulomb potential diverge in the mean and must be interpreted as expansions of Schwartz's generalized functions that converge weakly in suitable functionals."}
{"text":"\nUsing the Subaru Telescope and High Dispersion Spectrograph (HDS), we analyze the spatial variation of the Ha line profile in a Balmer-dominated shock located on the east side of Tycho's supernova remnant. In comparison to the Ha emission from the preshock gas, we detect an increased broadening and centroid shift of the narrow-component of the Ha line in the postshock region. This suggests the presence of a thin, 10^16 cm-wide precursor forming ahead of the shock where the material is heated and accelerated. The gradual gradient of the Ha intensity and line width in the preshock region further supports this idea. We observe a line width increase from ~30 km\/s to ~45 km\/s, with a redshift of ~5 km\/s across the Balmer filament. These features correspond to either a cosmic-ray or a fast neutral precursor."}
{"text":"This article examines the problem of describing polynomial hulls for orbits $Gv$, $v \\in V$, of a compact group $G \\subset \\GL(V)$, in the case where the identity component of $G$ is a torus $T$. It provides a universal construction for orbits that include $Gv \\subset T^\\bbC v$ and characterizes the pairs of $(G,V)$ where this holds in a generic form. Additionally, it provides a finite collection of inequalities that can be used to distinguish the hull of a finite union of $T$-orbits in $T^\\bbC v$ within the closure of $T^\\bbC v$. If the powers in the monomials do not depend on $v$ and $Gv$ is included in $T^\\bbC v$ for a generic $v$, the space $V$ and the group $G$ are determined as products of standard ones, where $G=S_nT$ is either $\\bbT^n$ or $\\SU(n)\\cap\\bbT^n$ with the torus of all diagonal matrices in $\\rU(n)$. Lastly, this paper also provides a new and more concise description of polynomial hulls for orbits of isotropy groups of bounded symmetric domains."}
{"text":"\nOur study focuses on the clustering of intermediate-mass (IM) Class 0 protostars located in star-forming regions. Using the Plateau de Bure Interferometer (PdBI) in its new A configuration, we obtained high spatial resolution and sensitivity images of three IM protostars with different luminosity. The results suggest that only one millimeter (mm) source is associated with the low luminosity source Serpens--FIRS 1, while two compact sources are detected towards CB 3 and IC1396 N with a separation of $\\sim$0.05 pc. The highest resolution 1.3mm image of IC 1396 N even shows that one of these cores is divided into three individual sources. This research aims to investigate the dependence of the clustering process on the luminosity of the source, providing important clues to understand the phenomena occurring in the intermediate-mass range."}
{"text":"\nWe demonstrate that the transitive powers of the Young-Jucys-Murphy elements X_i = (1 i) + ... + (i-1 i), i =1 , ..., n, which act on {1, ..., n} in the symmetric group S_n, lie in the centre of the group algebra of S_n. Furthermore, we establish the coefficients, known as star factorization numbers, for those powers and show that those numbers possess a polynomiality property. This centrality and polynomiality have a variety of applications. Firstly, it answers a question raised by Pak in regards to reduced decompositions. Secondly, it explains and extends the symmetry result discovered by Irving and Rattan. Thirdly, these polynomial numbers are connected to a known polynomiality property of double Hurwitz numbers related to branched covers of the sphere, signifying a potential ELSV-type formula associated with the star factorization numbers."}
{"text":"\nThe aim of this article is to understand the influence of a spin-dependent three-quark force (in addition to the existing pairwise quark-quark interactions) on the structure of the three-quark wave function in the high momentum regime of QCD, whereby the effect of the strong confining force is negligible. To this end, a special three-gluon vertex in the QCD Lagrangian is examined, which is exemplified by the 'Mercedes-Benz' Y-shape diagram. The resulting dynamics, namely that of a Salpeter-type equation formulated covariantly on the light-front, is evaluated in a manner that acknowledges the Markov-Yukawa Transversality Principle (MYTP), ensuring that the quark-antiquark Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) is applicable and interconnected to the same framework for interacting three quarks. Through such an approach, the contribution of the $qqq$ force can be accurately assessed in the form of an additional singularity due to the presence of an energetically negative eigenvalue of the spin operator $i \\sigma_1 . \\sigma_2 \\times \\sigma_3$ component of the force. This singularity has the potential to address the much-debated 'spin anomaly' of the proton."}
{"text":"\nThis study explored the dependence of Ultra-Luminous X-ray Sources (ULX) luminosities on the spectral model used through an analysis of 365 X-ray point sources from {\\it Chandra} observations of nearby galaxies. Results indicated a cumulative luminosity function that is significantly determined by the chosen model. Additionally, it was concluded that the ULX have indistinguishable spectral parameters of inner disk temperature at around 1 keV and photon index of almost 2, regardless of their luminosities. After considering foreground stars and known background objects, four sources with luminosities of over $10^{40}$ ergs\/s - Extremely Luminous X-ray sources - were identified. Spectra of these sources proved to be better represented by disk blackbody model than by power law one, confirming the two distinct spectral classes of the ELX; the ``supersoft'' with inner disk temperatures below 0.5 keV and the ``hard'', with inner disk temperatures above 1.3 keV. Such findings are consistent with the theory that the supersoft ELX contain intermediate size black holes and that the primary radiative mechanism for the hard ELX is likely saturated Inverse Comptonization."}
{"text":"\nWe utilize a recently established integration formula by Conrey, Farmer and Zirnbauer to estimate the expectation value of the phase factor of the staggered lattice QCD action in one dimension when a chemical potential is present. We determine that it is possible to incorporate the chemical potential into the quark masses in the same manner as for the QCD in three dimensions when the chemical potential is zero. At higher numbers of colors and a constant number of lattice points, chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken and the results are found to coincide with the effects related to a chiral Lagrangian. The eigenvalues of the Dirac operator are found to obey the random matrix theory for the QCD in three dimensions too. The discontinuity in the chiral condensate is a consequence of an alternative to the Banks-Casher formula which was recently found to pertain to QCD in four dimensions and a nonzero chemical potential. The influence of temperature on the average phase factor is explored in a schematic random matrix model."}
{"text":"\nThe aim of this study was to analyse the optical spectra of 28 hot massive stars located in the Large Magellanic Cloud, 22 of which were part of the N11 star-forming region. To do this, a combination of the FASTWIND stellar atmosphere code and PIKAIA genetic-algorithm optimisation routine was used. The findings suggested that the star formation sequence in N11 begins with the LH9 association, which induced the formation of LH10. Additionally, it was found that O2 stars had hotter temperatures compared to O3 stars (49-54kK vs 45-46kK). Results implied that the masses calculated for helium-enriched dwarfs and giants were lower than expected due to rotational-enhanced mixing surfacing primary helium and increasing their luminosity. For bright giants and supergiants, the masses were found to be consistent with modestly or slightly rotating objects. Moreover, the mass-loss properties fell in between galactic and SMC stars, and were in good agreement with theoretical predictions at LMC metallicity for 5.0 < log L\/L(sun) < 6.1."}
{"text":"\nEvidence from Jefferson Lab's proton-electron (HAPPEx and G0) parity-violating forward-scattering asymmetry measurements, in conjunction with neutrino-proton elastic cross section observation from Brookhaven's E734 project, has offered the opportunity to assess the strangeness contribution of the nucleon vector and axial form factors in the range of 0.45 to 1.0 GeV$^2$. These results, combined with the strange vector form factors found from other studies (SAMPLE, HAPPEx, PVA4 and G0) have reportedly been established by configurations of the $uuds\\bar{s}$ variety that are unlike the typical kaon-loop configurations linked to nucleon strangeness. To advance our knowledge of the $\\nu p$ elastic cross section, new experiments targeting lower $Q^2$ values with heightened precision are in the works. If successful, they will bring the ability to measure the strangeness fraction of nucleon spins, $\\Delta s$. Understanding how the quantities in the nucleus interact and affect the final state is paramount to maximize output of said experiments."}
{"text":"\n\nUsing VIMOS on the Very Large Telescope, the morphological and spectroscopic characteristics of three radio galaxies at a redshift of 2.5, MRC 1558-003, MRC 2025-218 and MRC 0140-257, and the giant (~60 kpc) Ly-alpha nebulae associated with them were explored. While the form of the nebulae differed, they were all aligned with the radio axis within 30\u00b0. The luminosity of the Ly-alpha nebulae was found to range from 0.3 to 3.4 x 10^44 erg\/s, and the Ly-alpha spectral profile presented strong variation with the full-width half-maximum ranging from 400-1500 km\/s and with velocity shifts from V ~ 120-600 km\/s. A model explaining the Ly-alpha morphological and spectroscopic properties associated with MRC 1568-003 was proposed, although the difficulty to reproduce the large FWHM values proved to be a challenge. Furthermore, a giant Ly-alpha nebula of ~85kpc with remarkably smooth motions (FWHM< 300 km\/s and V< 120 km\/s) was found connected to the radio galaxy MRC 0140-257 at a redshift of 2.64- an unparalleled observation among high-redshift (>2) radio galaxies."}

{"text":"\nThe two-dimensional kinetic Ising model, when subjected to varying magnetic fields, has been proven to show a dynamic phase transition (DPT). The associated order parameter, Q, is the period-averaged magnetization. This DPT is of the same universality class of the equilibrium phase transition in the Ising model in zero applied field. This paper discusses, for the first time, the scaling of the dynamic order parameter when a nonzero, period-averaged, magnetic `bias' field, H_b, is present. Results imply that H_b is an authoritative factor in the field conjugate to Q. Finite-size scaling of the dynamic order parameter above the critical period further fortifies this assertion. Additionally, a fluctuation-dissipation relation holds in the critical region, comprising of adjustable temperature, period, and field amplitude. This FDR allows for the replacement of the dynamic susceptibility by the scaled variance of Q."}
{"text":"\nWe analyzed interstellar neutral hydrogen (HI) emission patterns, along with small-scale structure observed by the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP), in the area l = 60 - 180 deg, b = 30 - 70 deg.  After comparing the distributions to a second area on the sky, we concluded that the associations between HI and WMAP were not random. An in-depth investigation of certain areas revealed new features about HI structure. For instance, in high-velocity cloud MI, HI and WMAP ILC morphologies were similar and there was an excess of soft X-ray and H-alpha emission. We posited that the high frequency continuum emission observed by WMAP could be coming from either the interface between HI structures and regions of high plasma density or from HI fluxes impacting each other, while potentially involving dust grains. Ultimately, the conclusions of this study seek to draw attention to these associations, without providing a concrete explanation."}
{"text":"\nThe intensity profiles of the H I Ly-$\\alpha$ line and the O VI and Mg X doublets\nemitted in solar coronal holes are studied in order to determine their sensitivity to electron density stratification. An analytical model for the large-scale coronal magnetic field is utilized to map out the outflow speed of the solar wind at any distance from the solar surface. Based on the assumption of an isotropic kinetic temperature of the coronal species, the effects of the density stratification on the total intensities, widths, and ratio of the observed lines are examined. It is found that the widths of the O VI and Mg X lines are affected by the adopted density profile, while Ly-$\\alpha$ is not. The calculated intensity values for Ly-$\\alpha$ and the O VI doublet are found to be in agreement with the observed measurements for most of the considered density models. Furthermore, the SOHO electron densities can explain the UVCS values for Ly-$\\alpha$ and the O VI doublet with an isotropic velocity distribution, therefore placing into doubt the necessity for strong velocity anisotropy."}
{"text":"\nThis paper discusses the results of a Hamburg Quasar Survey which identified five CVs.

Time-resolved optical spectroscopy also was conducted, which resulted in the identification of the CVs as SW Sextantis stars. The percentage of known SW Sex stars with orbital periods in the 3-4.5 h range is emphasized, and statistics are provided to back up this claim. An exploration of the common properties of SW Sex stars is included, as well as a discussion on why the pile-up of systems close to the upper boundary of this period gap is hard to explain in terms of the standard theory of CV evolution."}
{"text":"\nThe beginning and end of time have been philosophical questions for centuries, yet a growing body of scientific research is providing new answers. Stephen Hawking's renowned work on cosmology, first published in 1988, is just one of the many contributions that have been instrumental in looking more deeply into these topics. In this book, the author offers a comprehensive examination of the current scientific knowledge and theories that are relevant to this mysterious area. They conclude that the least likely option is more in line with traditional philosophy, while a cyclic model (no beginning or end to time) is the most likely. In order to do justice to the various aspects of this complex debate, the book is arranged such that readers can choose to start with the final chapter or work their way through the entire book.

{"text":"\nUsing scanning flow cytometry (SFC) and the discrete dipole approximation (DDA), a study was conducted to explore the elastic light scattering of mature red blood cells (RBCs). SFC enables measurement of the angular variation of light scattering intensity of single particles, while DDA modeling treats the RBC as a biconcave disk. This research evaluated the impact of cell orientation to the scattered light direction and performed numerical simulations of multiple indicatrices based on varying aspect ratios and volumes of RBC. Results from SFC and DDA modeling showed a close agreement, supporting the effectiveness of the biconcave disk model. Additionally, other models such as the disk-sphere and a oblate spheroid model were provided to simulate the SFC's light-scattering output responses in both face-on and rim-on directions. The oblate spheroid model was observed to best resemble the aforementioned biconcave disk model when taking into account rim-on incidence."}
{"text":"This article discusses an extended version of loop quantum cosmology (LQC), which introduces an underlying lattice of quantum effects to anisotropic models. It provides an exploration of new mathematical problems posed by refinements of the lattice in dynamical changes of the volume, and considers how these models can be explored and evaluated. A review of two detailed examples shows that stability conditions can place constraints on the suitable refinement models, even when there is no fundamental Hamiltonian to define changes to the lattice. An investigation of LQC is provided, and it is noted that quantum corrections due to inverse powers of the metric components in constraints tend to be much higher than those that recently were artificially suppressed in isotropic and free scalar models."}
{"text":"\nThe present study examines the implications of orientational order on depletion forces, and thus its effects on the stability of formation of smectic phases in mixtures of hard rods and hard spheres. An analysis is conducted through Onsager theory, taking into account rods of varying aspect ratios and spheres of varying diameters. It is determined that an orientational disorder causes a decrease in depletion effects and thus stability of the smectic phase as compared to when orientations are constrained to be parallel. To gain insight on particle geometry, systems of parallel rods of different shapes are compared. The Zwanzig approximation of Fundamental-Measure density-functional theory is used to study mixtures of parallelepipeds and cubes. Results show that the $\\tau$ parameter, which reflects depletion strength, follows a linear asymptotic behaviour in the limit of high ratios of both rod breadth to cube side length and rod aspect ratio."}
{"text":"\nIn this article we address the challenges posed by searches for Higgs bosons within the framework of minimal-flavor-violating supersymmetric models at the Tevatron and LHC hadron colliders. We assess constraints from results of B-physics experiments such as b \u2192 s\u03b3 and B_u \u2192 \u03c4\u03bd and from the B_s \u2192 \u03bc+\u03bc- branching ratio; and have determined that stringent limitations are in place for large values of the trilinear soft breaking parameter A_t, leading to diminished prospects for non-standard Higgs searches at hadron colliders. Converse to this, our findings suggest better chances of directly detecting non-standard Higgs bosons at the Tevatron and LHC are expected for small values of A_t and large values of the Higgsino mass parameter \u03bc. We further explore the projected sensitivities of the ATLAS and CMS experiments searching for SM Higgs bosons, and investigate the ability of the LHC to probe the entire MSSM parameter area. Additionally, expected Tevatron collider sensitivity in the SM Higgs h \u2192 bb\u0305 channel is demonstrated to ascertain that 3 sigma evidence is available in B-physics allowed regions for small or mid-level values of the stop mixing parameter."}
{"text":"\nIn this article, we suggest a particular class of objects in the weakly coupled regime of a large N gauge theory in the Higgs phase which bear similarity to black holes. These objects, referred to as ``plasma puddles'', are meta-stable lumps of hot plasma situated in locally un-Higgsed regions of space. They primarily decay via O(1\/N) thermal radiation, but also absorb all matter incident upon them via a particle showering mechanism. Through the use of this technique, we can calculate the average energy of all particles released from the object, which is independent of the energy of the incident particle. By relating the object's size and temperature to fundamental parameters of the gauge theory, we can further conjecture that when the object emits thermal Hawking radiation, not only is it ''black'' (absorbing all incident particles), but it also appears to be stable in a classical sense, with its Bekenstein entropy bound being satisfied. Due to the AdS\/CFT duality and the many similarities between plasma puddles and black holes, we postulate that black objects in quantum gravity are a generic consequence."}
{"text":"\nExploring the various elements of stochastic resonance in reaction-diffusion systems, we apply the nonequilibrium potential approach. We start by examining a simple scalar model which enables us to analytically obtain stationary patterns. Our findings indicate that system-sized resonance can be derived from this method and that array-enhanced resonance is heightened when the diffusion coefficient is dependent on the field. Further studying a stylized version of the FitzHugh-Nagumo system, we acquire a meaningful scalar model including a nonlocal contribution. We analyze the influence of the range of the nonlocal kernel on stochastic resonance which displays an optimum range for maximizing the system's response."}

This wavepacket distortion affects the waveform profile as a function of radial separation from the source, with an accuracy dependent on the total energy emitted, emission time, and total binary mass, M. Simulations in finite boxes with waveforms extracted within a radius of <= 100M can be affected by this wave distortion, resulting in errors in the waveform template for LIGO and LISA. Knowing the distortion parameters can help decrease the waveform extraction errors in numerical simulations."}
{"text":"\nIn this paper, we analyze the stellar content of twelve fields in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), located between ~1 and ~4 degrees from the center of the galaxy, by analyzing ground-based B and R-band color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) reaching the oldest main-sequence turnoffs. Our analysis, including a comparison with theoretical isochrones and color functions, finds that the underlying spheroidal population in the SMC is composed of both intermediate-age and old stars. While the three fields from the Wing region show very active current star formation, the fields from the West and South have a much less populated young main-sequence, with a strong depletion of star formation at around 2 Gyr ago. Further, the red clump in all CMDs is consistent with the large amount of intermediate-age stars. This could indicate that a disk population has overruled any possible old halo in all the observed fields."}
{"text":"\nThis paper examines the consequences of assuming the hoop conjecture, a criterion for gravity-induced collapse. From the gravitational limitations set, fundamental uncertainties in spatial distance of the Planck length, boundaries on the amount of information held within a limited region, and limits on the rate of information processing within that region result. In conclusion, I consider the implications that quantum randomness has in determining the late universe, and its impact on the overall amount of information existing in the cosmos. This research draws on a lecture which originated at the 2007 Bellairs Research Institute (McGill University) gathering on black holes and quantum information."}
{"text":"\nThe impact of an ordering phase transition (NIPT) that is driven by noise and is of potential scientific and technological interest has been analysed. By looking at the statistics and spectrum of the noise present, the task of understanding the effects on the NIPT phase diagram is made easier. To do this, noisy models of white noise and stochastic differential equations are observed to generate stationary noise with Gaussian pdf and a variance reduced by the self-correlation time (\\tau). In examining the influence of these noises, the focus was on the order parameter and the susceptibility. The findings indicate that while fat-tail distributions (q>1) oppose the effect of correlation, compact-support ones (q<1) enhance it. The study also observed an effect on the susceptibility, especially in the compact-support case."}
{"text":"\n\nThis paper looks at M87 in the mid-infrared spectrum range of 5-35 um using imaging and spectroscopy from Subaru and the Spitzer Space Telescope. We find that the variable jet component, HST-1, does not contribute much to the mid-infrared flux. Analyzing the knot A\/B complex of the jet in the 15-35 $\\mu$m range, the emission appears to be synchrotron in nature. In the nucleus, however, the synchrotron model falls short to explain the observations. The detected spectrum contains an excess of emission at 25-35 um which is likely thermal, produced by dust of a temperature of 55 $\\pm$ 10 K and a luminosity of around 10$^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$. The resolution of Spitzer suggests that the dusty source is located within ~5\u201d (390 pc) of the nucleus which is inconsistent with the predictions of a classical AGN unified scheme. Nonetheless, this is in line with the AGN unification framework for low-luminosity AGNs."}
{"text":"This article presents a systematic characterization of open cluster remnants. Photometric and proper motion data are used to obtain structural properties, ages, reddening values and distances, as well as evidence for the presence of binary stars. Criteria for defining these objects as physical systems are established. These analyses shed light on potential evolutionary stages of open clusters and enable the detection of thirteen searchable open cluster remnants. Statistical comparison and composite diagrams are used to overcome the limitations of small stellar samples. These diagrams resemble the distributions of single-star and unresolved binary star systems in open clusters."}
{"text":"\nThis article proposes a linear reformulation of the Kuramoto model that depicts self-synchronization in systems of globally coupled oscillators of varying frequencies. This reformulation provides an analytical means of exploring synchronization issues that the original Kuramoto model could not solve. It enables one to compute the synchronization parameters and critical points of the full phase-locking transition for finite numbers of oscillators, a phenomenon that the original Kuramoto model could only do implicitly for mean-field cases. In addition, it can solve the dynamics leading toward a steady state for new classes of continuous systems. The reformulated model is primarily focused on globally connected systems, yet it could also be deployed to investigate local or asymmetrically coupled systems."}
{"text":"This research study investigates the accuracy of the density functional theory found in the FIREBALL code in relation to the empirical pi-bond model for calculating the electronic properties of carbon nanotubes. DFT results of the effective mass, band gap, and transmission coefficients for zigzag (n,0) nanotubes with n values ranging from 5  to 35 are compared against the empirically derived pi-bond model. Results show that the DFT values for effective masses differ from the pi-bond values by approximately 9% for nanotubes with 17 \u2264 n \u2264 29. In addition, for nanotubes with 13 \u2264 n \u2264 25, DFT band gaps are estimated to be between 20-180 meV less than the empirical values. These discrepancies increase as the diameter of the nanotube decreases and the pi-bond model becomes less reliable for nanotubes with n \u2264 8."}
{"text":"This paper explores the idea of breaking down homogeneous polynomial and analytic functions defined on quadratic surfaces into their multipole vector components. We discuss how this approach relates to classical harmonic analysis and the associated Laplace operator and more general differential operators related to the shape of the quadratic surface. Investigating the geometry and topology of the multipole spaces, we employ analytic geometry and singularity theory to delve further into these spaces which feature a variety of modified braid groups."}
{"text":"\nThis research provides a five-band optical photometry catalog for the North Ecliptic Pole region consisting of approximately 56,000 sources brighter than r\u2019 = 23 mag. These sources include both point and extended sources and were observed extensively using MegaCam at CFHT. Results from the analysis of the catalog's photometric properties, including color-magnitude and color-color diagrams, indicate that the majority of extended sources possess colors of (u*-r')< 3.0 and (g'-z')> 0.5. Additionally, a comparison of these sources to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey data allowed for the identification of two probable clusters and one group. Ultimately, this catalog may aid in separating extended sources from point sources, even when the sources are faint and traditional morphological classification schemes are ineffective."}
{"text":"\nIn this work, kinematics and dynamics of the globular clusters and planetary nebulae of NGC 5128, a giant elliptical galaxy, have been studied using a spectroscopic sample of 340 globular clusters and 780 planetary nebulae. Subdividing the globular cluster sample, the kinematics of metal-rich and metal-poor subpopulations were compared and found to be quite similar. Comparing the kinematics of the two, differences were observed in the outer regions of the halo. The total mass of NGC 5128 was determined from the two populations, resulting in a mass of approximately 1.0 x 10^(12) Msun and 1.3 x 10^(12) Msun from planetary nebulae and globular clusters, respectively. In addition, a new and homogeneous catalog of known globular clusters in NGC 5128, combining all previous definitive cluster identifications from studies, as well as 80 new globular clusters, was presented."}
{"text":"\nAfter an initial round of observations conducted through the N2K program, subsequent follow-up over the past three years has shown that these four stars each possess a Jovian-mass planet. The orbital periods range from 21 days up to a few years, and the planets have minimum masses from 0.67 to 4.74 \\mjup. All of the stars have supersolar metallicity. HD 17156 has an eccentricity of 0.67, one of the highest known for a planet with a relatively short period. A transit search was conducted but was unsuccessful, covering only 25% of the search space. We have identified five new intermediate-period planets from the N2K sample."}
{"text":"\nAn investigation has been conducted on the statistical properties of giant pulses from the Crab pulsar using data from 3.5 hours of observation with a Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope at a frequency of 1200 MHz. A PuMa pulsar backend provided voltage recording of X and Y linear polarization in two 10 MHz bands, where the time resolution was limited to 4 microseconds to match interstellar scattering effects. Around 18000 giant pulses were identified at a 6 sigma detection threshold. Cumulative probability distributions (CPDs) were developed for groups of GPs with different widths, leading to the observation of distinct differences. Power-law fits to the CPDs displayed variable slopes from -1.7 to -3.2 from shortest to longest GPs, respectively, with breaks indicating flattening of indices from -1.0 to -1.9 respectively. GPs displaying greater peak flux density were found to have shorter durations. These findings are evalutated against previous studies and the resultant implications for an understanding of the emission mechanism."}
{"text":"\nThis paper explores the use of colour pairs in AB systems for constraining stellar-population parameters such as age and metallicity. With the help of a standard synthesis model, we investigate the sensitivity of UBVRIJHK and ugriz colour pairs to age and metallicity parameters. Our results suggest that using certain colour pair combinations can make it possible to accurately estimate both age and metallicity of a stellar population. We find that the best pairings are [(r-K), (u-R)] and [(r-K), (u-r)], which have age uncertainties of less than 3.89 Gyr and metallicity uncertainties of less than 0.34 dex. We demonstrate that pairs involving either UBVRIJHK or ugriz magnitudes work better than using singular ones and show that photometric data from instruments like SDSS and 2MASS can be used with these colour pairs to effectively break the age-metallicity degeneracy. Besides this, these pairs can also be used in conjunction with line indices for further measurement of population parameters."}
{"text":"\nIn this work, we investigate the interactions between Jupiter and Saturn which may have inhibited Type II migration, a process where planets move inwards to the Sun. To explore a range of possibilities, we use a unique hydrodynamical code to simulate the evolution of the gaseous proto-planetary disk. Our findings suggest that Jupiter and Saturn can become locked in a resonant orbit with one another, such as the 2:3 resonance, which disrupts migration; their gaps in the disk overlap, shifting the torque balance and greatly slowing or even reversing the process. Our work corroborates the models introduced by Tsiganis et al. (2005) and Gomes et al. (2005) in order to explain the current orbits of the giant planets and the Late Heavy Bombardment of the Moon. The degree to which the gap overlap occurs increases for disks with low viscosity and cooler temperatures."}
{"text":"\nBy using kinetic theory tools, recent research has advanced our understanding of the macroscopic behavior of grains under rapid flow conditions at low-density. This chapter reviews these findings and provides explicit expressions for the necessary transport coefficients. The topics explored include transport properties, energy nonequipartition, instabilities, segregation or mixing, non-Newtonian behavior, and more. Comparisons of kinetic theory analysis with Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations show the dependability of this theory to accurately describe granular flows with high levels of dissipation."}
{"text":"\nThis research suggests that the currently known galactic double neutron stars largely formed through two different mechanisms. Five of these stars have reported low masses, indicating that they were formed through electron-capture collapse of O-Ne-Mg cores in helium stars of less than 3.5Msun in mass. The other neutron stars appear to have been formed through the equally violent collapse of iron-cores in higher initial masses and have kicked out with higher velocities. The lack of low-velocity single young radio pulsars tally with the conclusions of this research, as the electron-capture mechanism is only thought to be viable in binary systems rather than as single stars."}
{"text":"\nThis paper investigates the impacts of feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in cosmological simulations of galaxy formation. We present a model which takes into account the mass-accretion into central black holes as well as multi-phase star formation within the gas to describe the evolution of both galaxies and the said black holes. A novel component of the model is that it acknowledges two modes of accretion: the usual thin, radiatively-efficient flows and alternatively, radiatively-inefficient flows referred to as RIAFs. It is assumed that only the latter produces the AGN feedback. Results show that subsequent to a burst of star formation, the rate of mass accretion declines and the flow of accretion transitions to a RIAF. This coincides with when the AGN feedback starts to diminish star formation in the galactic disks and brings star formation in the bulge almost to a halt. Our model predicts certain attributes of low-luminosity AGNs which match observations of Seyfert galaxies, such as bolometric luminosities and jet powers. Interestingly, an examination of the mass ratio of central black holes to the parent spheroid indicates that the ratio is almost the same regardless of the presence of either supernova feedback or AGN feedback."}
{"text":"\nBy examining a sample of 28 sources featuring methanol maser emission, we employ single-pixel observations of 10 transitions of HCO^+, CO and CS isotopomers on the IRAM 30m telescope to assess the molecular environment of candidate massive young stellar objects (MYSOs). The systemic velocity inferrred from the optically thin line observations is consistent with the central velocity of maser emission in most cases. Evidence of molecular outflows is indicated in 64% of targets by showings of line wings in one or more of the CO, HCO^+ and CS species. Comparing the widths of these line wings and the methanol maser emission leads us to the conclusion that the latter can exist in both the inner parts of molecular clouds or circumstellar discs and in the outer parts related to molecular outflows. The resulting physical conditions from the CO and HCO^+ lines and the CS line intensity ratios make for better maser model input parameters."}
{"text":"\nThis article seeks to uncover the emerging global structure of the international trade network through the analysis of world network of bilateral trade imbalances. We develop a general procedure to systematically detect the most influential trade channels to determine global interdependency. This procedure is applicable to any weighted network to detect the underlying flux structures, and as such can provide new quantitative insights into the propagation of economic crises. The global transport flow properties of the world trade web generates a ranking of trade partnerships that accentuates global interdependency and reveals information impossible to glean from simple local analyses."}
{"text":"\nIn this paper we explore the potential of 2p--2s fine structure lines to offer insight into the reionization and recombination epochs. For parameters typical of luminous sources observed around  redshift $z \\simeq 6.3$, we calculate the strength of the signal produced by neutral hydrogen to have a brightness temperature of roughly 20 micro K. This signal is within the scope of detection of present and future radio telescopes. We also examine the features of the signal from the epoch of recombination, with a peak brightness expected to be approximately 100 micro K. Unfortunately, this signal is difficult if not impossible to detect due to the intense bright Galactic emission at the corresponding frequencies of 5 - 10 MHz."}
{"text":"This article investigates the association of near- and far-infrared counterparts of millimeter dust cores in the Vela Molecular Ridge Cloud D. Using IR observations (specifically H_2 narrow-band at 2.12 micron and N broad band at 10.4 micron, as well as existing IR catalogues such as IRAS, MSX, and 2MASS), JHK data from the literature, and new observations, the authors calculated the spatial coincidence, infrared colors, and spectral energy distributions to determine the associated sources. Out of 29 resolved dust cores, only 7 showed no signs of star formation activity, while the other ones were associated with far-IR sources, H_2 jets, or near-IR objects that showed a high intrinsic color excess. The spectral indices peaked at values typical of Class I objects, and 3 objects were identified as potential Class 0 sources. The analysis showed a high detection rate (30%) of H_2 jets driven by sources located inside them mm-cores, suggesting the presence of both low- and intermediate-mass star formation. However, it was noted that the rate of activity vs. inactivity of the cores might be biased by the sensitivity of the observed data."}
{"text":"\nThe evaluation of the neutral $K$ meson transition from an incoherent to a coherent state is studied. We look at the two observables of the system, which are the norm of the state and the magnitude of the Stokes vector, as arrows of time and study how they each evolve from one state to the other. CP-violation is taken into consideration and leads to the unitarity bound and a new bound for the $B^0$-$\\bar{B^0}$ system. Analysing the Stokes parameter $\\zeta_3$ reveals the average strangeness of the beam as it evolves. Moreover, the transformation of the Stokes vector from $|\\vec{\\zeta}| = 0$ to $|\\vec{\\zeta}| = 1$ is comparable to the order parameter when a system gores through a spontaneous symmetry breaking."}
{"text":"\nThe study of competitive random sequential adsorption from a binary particle mix on a line is discussed using both an analytic recursive approach and Monte Carlo simulations. We discover a significant relationship between the distributions of small and large particles such that, in spite of significant variations in the partial contributions to the fill factor, the variance of the total fill factor remains fairly low. The variabilities of the partial contributions from each size particle appear to be significantly different from one another, with the larger particle distribution being more correlated. The dissimilarity in the fluctuations of partial fill factors raises as the particle size ratio increases. The additional variance in the partial input of the smaller particles results from changes in the dimensions of gaps between the larger particles. The importance of our discoveries to gamma detectors used in semiconductors, wherein the detector energy resolution is governed by correlations in the cascade energy branching process, is further examined."}
{"text":"This study utilized high-resolution infrared spectroscopy in the 2.3-4.6 micron region to analyze HR 4049, a peculiar A supergiant single-lined spectroscopic binary. Lines of CO, OH and H2O, as well as features of absorption and emission were observed in the near infrared spectrum. The presence of OH and H2O lines verified an oxygen-rich nature for the circumbinary gas surrounding the disk. Furthermore, the line profiles showed that the circumbinary gas was located in a thin, rotating layer near the dust disk. The analysis of the dust, gas circumbinary disk and spectroscopic orbit yielded masses for the individual stars. Additionally, it was discovered that the gas in the disk was flowing outward with a velocity greater than 1 km\/s. Abundances of volatile elements were found to be near solar, but depletion of refractory elements was noted, a result of abundance winnowing through the separation of volatiles from the grains. Finally, carbon and oxygen isotopic abundances were determined to be typical AGB values."}
{"text":"\nIn this study, we investigate the adiabatic temperature alteration of the inverse\nmagnetocaloric Ni$_{50}$Mn$_{34}$In$_{16}$ alloy attained through magnetic field application around the Curie point. Using magnetization and specific heat measurements, we analyze and compare the induced temperature changes relative to thermodynamic calculations. Our results show that the conventional magnetocaloric effect causes the temperature of the alloy to rise, yet temperatures markedly reduce due to the inverse magnetocaloric effect associated with the martensitic transition. We found that the observed conventional effect observed at the second-order paramagnetic-ferromagnetic phase transition was in concurrence with our calculations. Conversely, the first order structural transition results showed that the calculated temperature increases were lower than the recorded values at high fields - a phenomenon termed here as irreversible thermodynamics."}
{"text":"  We present a comprehensive analysis of the evolution of Type Ia supernova 2003du, which was monitored through optical and near infrared photometry and low resolution spectroscopy for 480 days following its detection. We found that its light curves, color indices and spectral features were consistent with a normal Type Ia, and it had a B-band maximum of 13.49 magnitudes. The reddening of the event in its host galaxy was determined to be negligible, with a distance modulus of 32.79 magnitudes. Further analysis of the UVOIR bolometric light curve indicated a peak bolometric luminosity of 1.35 \u00d7 10^43 erg\/s while producing approximately 0.68-0.8 M_sun of Ni56. Furthermore, the pre-maximum spectra showed high velocity features of Ca II and Si II, which we compared to those of other well-observed Type Ia supernovae and concluded that the presence of two blended absorption components may explain some of the peculiarities in their spectra."}
{"text":"\nThis work presents observations of SiO, HCO$^+$ and H$^{13}$CO$^+$ from the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope towards 23 sources of massive star forming regions, some of which are known to contain molecular outflows and ultracompact HII regions. Data suggest that SiO is more likely to be detected in younger regions where there are ongoing shocks, while SO$_2$ is serendipitously detected in 17 sources, and HCO$^+$ in all sources, with nine potential cases of signature of infall. For these nine sources, mass infall rates are estimated to be between 1$\\times10^{-2}$ and 2$\\times10^{-5}$ M$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. Seven sources show concurrent SiO outflows and HCO$^+$ infall signatures, while the H$^{13}$CO$^+$ abundance was seen to increase with the SiO abundance. Taking this survey results into account, two distinct models for massive star formation via accretion may hold true - that of ionized accretion and halted accretion - with the latter being pertinent to the evolution of the massive protostar beyond the formation of an HII region."}
{"text":"This paper provides an in-depth analysis of how resonance saturation in QCD can be understood from the perspective of Pade Approximants to meromorphic functions. This mathematical tool offers a unified view of various results from the literature and is tested using a toy model for the <VV-AA> two-point correlator. The relationship between Chiral Expansion, Operator Product Expansion, and resonance spectrum are discussed. The 1977 proposal by Migdal is also addressed, and its implications in the context of AdS\/QCD models highlighted. The general conclusion from our work is that while rational approximants may be used to accurately describe a Green's function in the Euclidean, the same is not the case in the Minkowski regime due to the occurrence of unphysical poles."}
{"text":"In this study, we use first-principles density functional theory-based calculations to explore the relationship between\nmagnetic ordering and structural instabilities of high-symmetry cubic perovskite biferroics with rare-earth (R = La, Y, Lu) and\nBi-ions. We examine the phonons of the different para-, ferro-, and antiferromagnetic states at the $\\Gamma$ and\n$R$ points, and find that the structure with G-type antiferromagnetic ordering is the most stable. We also detect\nsignificant instabilities associated with rotations of oxygen octahedra, and that Cr-O-Cr bond angle destabilization\ndepends sensitively on the magnetic ordering.

{"text":"\nThis article looks at the possible explanation for high-frequency quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) observed in the binary system GRS 1915+105 containing near-extreme Kerr black hole with a dimensional spin a>0.98. By examining the model of oscillations induced by the hump of the orbital velocity profile (associated with the locally non-rotating frames - LNRF) in discs orbiting near-extreme Kerr black holes, we find that assuming a mass of 14.8M_sun and spin a=0.9998, the model predicts frequencies that are very close to those observed. Forced resonant phenomena in non-linear oscillations due to humpy-frequency excitations in Keplerian discs can explain the high-frequency QPOs in GRS 1915+105 within the margin of observational errors."}
{"text":"\nTo study the effects of polymers dispersed in a turbulent plane shear flow, we examine the dynamics of a FENE (finitely extensible nonlinear elastic) dumbbell ensemble at a moderate Reynolds number. We couple the dumbbells to the Newtonian solvent of the flow via a volume forcing term in the Navier-Stokes equations, connecting both components of the viscoelastic fluid in a two-way coupling. Varying the Weissenberg and Stokes numbers, to indicate how the rubber-like polymers react to the surrounding flow, we quantify the effects of the polymer feedback on the turbulence budget. The maximum reduction in turbulent drag was elevated by as much as 20% as the inertia was increased. The angular statistics of the dumbbells depicted an increased alignment with the mean flow direction in response to both decreased elasticity and increased inertia. Additionally, the probability density function of transverse derivatives of the streamwise components indicates a stretching of the dumbbells in regions where bi-axial strain or vortex stretching produces the highest turbulence."}
{"text":"\nThis paper investigates how perturbative quantum gravity affects the particle \nphysics phenomenology of quasi-realistic heterotic string models. We identify an \nappealing explanation for the longevity of the proton that lies in the existence \nof an Abelian gauge symmetry. This U(1) symmetry should suppress the proton decay \nmediating operators, permit fermion Yukawa couplings to the electroweak Higgs \ndoublets, and allow the suppression of left-handed neutrino masses by a seesaw \nmechanism. Following stringent requirements, we successfully demonstrate the \nexistence of a suitable U(1) symmetry in this class of models.

{"text":"\nThis article introduces a rigorous mathematical model for measurement-based quantum computing, specifically the recently introduced one-way quantum computer. The authors present a concrete syntax and operational semantics for programs, and an algebra of these programs derived from a denotational semantics. Most notably, they present a calculus for reasoning locally and compositionally about these programs. Furthermore, they develop a rewrite theory and prove a standardization theorem to place all programs in an equivalent standard form, affecting quantum architecture and exposing the dependency structure of measurements. Additionally, they formalize several other measurement-based models and embed them compositionally to demonstrate that their framework contributes to measurement-based computing in general."}
{"text":"\nWe present a detailed and systematic analysis of the space of proper colorings (solutions) to a random graph with a given number of colors, and no adjacent vertices having the same color. Using the cavity method, we show that with increasing average vertex degree, the set of solutions undergoes several phase transitions which are similar to those seen in the mean field theory of glasses. Firstly, there is a clustering transition, where the most entropically dominant part of the phase space divides into an exponential number of pure states, making uniform sampling of solutions difficult. Thereafter, the space of solutions becomes concentrated into a finite number of the largest states, reducing the total entropy of solutions compared to the annealed one. Additionally, a freezing transition happens when a finite fraction of nodes freeze in the most entropically dominant states, with each node being given one color in all solutions in the state. Finally, above the coloring threshold, no further solutions are available. We compute the critical connectivities for Erdos-Renyi and regular random graphs, determining their asymptotic values for a high number of colors. We discuss the algorithmic consequences of our findings, arguing that the onset of computational complexity is not closely connected to the clustering transition. We evaluate the performance of a simple local Walk-COL algorithm and the belief propagation approach in the light of our results."}
{"text":"This article examines the interplay between Monte Carlo Optimization (MCO) of a parametric integral, Parametric Learning (PL), and 'blackbox'\/'oracle'-based optimization (BO). We observe four main contributions: (1) we prove the mathematical equivalence of MCO and a number of PL problems, thus providing an additional application field for PL; (2) we develop an original version of the Probability Collectives (PC) algorithm for BO, 'immediate sampling', which transforms BO into MCO; (3) we show how cross-validation and bagging can be used to enhance immediate sampling; and (4) we investigate how fitting a model to the sample point locations combined with their associated integrand values can lead to improvements in MCO."}
{"text":"\nThis paper investigates the structure and characteristics of main sequence stars within the mass range of 1-2 M_sun which are both chemically homogeneous and differentially rotating. A code derived from self-consistent field method was utilized to construct the models. These stars have generally lower luminosities and temperatures and flattened shapes compared to their nonrotating counterparts. It is also noted that depending on the differential rotating degree, the polar radius might also be smaller or larger. Moreover, fast rotation may even provide an interior convective core in 1 M_sun and 2 M_sun models. Lastly, this paper points out its implications, such as the similarity between the properties of rotating and nonrotating models of different masses, a lower luminosity for the young rapidly spinning Sun, destruction of light metals by nuclear reactions beneath the convective envelope, and solar-like oscillations or a hydromagnetic dynamo in 1.5 - 2 M_sun stars."}
{"text":"\n\nThis article looks at the turbulent mixing that occurs during the accretion of matter onto the surface of a neutron star. We explore the resulting differentially rotating profile and the influence it has on type I X-ray bursts. We find that a nearly uniform rotation is achieved due to the radial and azimuthal magnetic field components, strengths of which are ~10^5 G and ~10^10 G respectively. A small shear then transports the accreted angular momentum to the interior, triggering turbulent mixings. We find that the greatest impact appears at high accretion rates, low spin frequencies, or a combination of both. This can lead to two new types of ignition and burning, one of which may explain some of the observed X-ray bursts. The article also finally hypothesizes that the change in X-ray burst properties near one-tenth of the Eddington accretion rate may be caused by the stable helium burning that is produced when the mixing is sufficiently strong."}
{"text":"This research seeks to develop a better understanding of Hamiltonian systems that can be used for universal adiabatic quantum computing. Two model Hamiltonians that are of particular interest to those who are interested in realizing a universal adiabatic quantum computer are presented. These Hamiltonians are the simplest known QMA-complete two-local models, and it is demonstrated how an Ising model with 1-local transverse field can be extended to a universal quantum computation model by the addition of a two-local transverse XX coupling. Additionally, spin systems with only one-local Z and X fields and two-local ZX interactions can be demonstrated to be both universal and QMA-complete."}
{"text":"\nWe have conducted a thorough analysis of the X-ray afterglow of the GRB 050730, which was observed by Swift and XMM-Newton. The aftereffect was seen to decrease in intensity over time, yet with multiple brightening activities that lasted for over two orders of magnitude in time. Seven separate flares starting from 236 seconds and extending up to 41.2 ks after the outburst were recorded. The underlying decline of the afterglow could be explained using a twofold broken power-law model, characterized by its three parts before, between and after the breaks at t_1 and t_2 respectively. In addition, the X-ray afterglow spectrum was well-suited to be fit by an absorption model with a column density of 1.28*10^22 cm^-2. This model also demonstrated significant X-ray spectral change during the duration of the flares. The majority of the flares had similar ratios of Delta_t\/t_p between the span of the flare and the point at which it peaked. It was found that the first three flares had properties consistent with a combination of high-latitude emission and refreshed shocks, as well as satisfying the Amati relation but disagreeing with the Ghirlanda relation."}
{"text":"This study presents detailed observations of IRAS 18317-0757, a star-forming region containing a cluster of five dust cores, one of which is linked to an ultracompact HII region, and another is associated with an H2O maser. We detected only the UCHII region at 2.7 mm and found that the non-detections at 2.7 mm and in the MSX mid-IR bands were indicative of cool dust with a temperature of 13-40K and luminosity of 1000-40000 Lsun. By combining single-dish and interferometric data, we have identified over two dozen virialized C18O cores and ~40% of the total molecular gas mass in the region. While the extent of C18O and dust emission are similar, we see no clear correlation between the two emission peaks. 2MASS has identified 123 stars in the region, 11 of which are likely to be within the star-forming cluster. Two of them were previously found to be O stars via IR spectroscopy and a number of B-type (proto)stars appear to be forming on the periphery. Our observations show that the molecular cloud has been significantly fragmented during the formation of the UCHII region and suggests further star formation is underway."}
{"text":"\nThis paper presents a photometric study of the deeply eclipsing SW Sex-type nova-like cataclysmic variable star BH Lyncis. Through time-resolved V-band CCD photometry obtained spanning seven nights between 1999 and 2004, eleven new eclipse timings were determined and an orbital ephemeris with an orbital period of 0.155875577(14) days was refined. The star was found to be in a high-state, with V~15.5 mag during the observations, and ~1.5 mag deep eclipses with a mean full-width at half-flux of 0.0683(+\/-0.0054)P_orb. Notably, the eclipse shape was highly variable, changing even from cycle to cycle, possibly due to accretion disc surface brightness distribution variations, or through time-dependent accretion disc self-occultation or variations of the hot spot(s) intensity. Negative superhumps with period of ~0.145 day were also detected in two of the long runs in 2000, with the possible connection between SW Sex and negative superhump phenomena being discussed and a way to observationally test this being suggested."}
{"text":"\nThis article examines the use of antenna combining techniques for the downlink channel in Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) systems. A combing scheme is proposed which focuses on minimizing the effects of Multi-User Interference (MUI) and maximizing Accuracy of Channel Feedback. This method was compared to traditional Maximum-Ratio Combining (MRC) and was seen to perform better in a MIMO environment. Analysis was performed to demonstrate how significant feedback requirements can be reduced through antenna combining and user selection strategies. Furthermore, robustness against the receiver estimation error is considered."}
{"text":"\nUsing methods of Malliavin calculus, this article provides quantified estimates of the one- and two-point densities of solutions to systems of non-linear stochastic heat equations with multiplicative noise in spatial dimension 1. Our analysis focuses on bounding the one-point density, the two-point density as (s, y) approaches (t,x), as well as the hitting probabilities of the process {u(t, x)}_{t \\in \\mathbb{R}_+, x \\in [0,1]}. Ultimately, this paper provides a better understanding of the range, Hausdorff dimension, and level sets of these processes for both d small and large."}
{"text":"\nIn this paper, we present optical spectra from the UVES Paranal Observatory Project of CaII K and TiII spectral lines from early-type stars, as well as HI 21-cm spectra from the Vila-Elisa and Leiden-Dwingeloo surveys. These spectra have been used to infer distances to intermediate and high velocity clouds. We highlight four different sightlines, HD 30677, HD 46185, HD 196426 and HD 19445, by comparing the signal-to-noise (S\/N) ratios of the CaII K and HI 21-cm spectra and the velocity of the clouds in each case. This analysis has set firm lower distance limits of 2.7-kpc, 2.9-kpc, 700-pc and 39-pc, respectively. Similarly, a lower distance of 3.2-kpc was determined towards the HVC gas related to the Magellanic System, for the sightline HD 115363. Despite this lack of positive evidence for CaII K absorption, the data provide reliable limits for distances to these clouds."}
{"text":"We analyze the ability of different nucleobases to interact with graphene in a study that uses density functional theory and Hartree-Fock plus second order Moeller-Plesset perturbation theory. Our results demonstrate that the nucleobases, adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), thymine (T), and uracil (U), inherently differ in how strongly they interact with graphene due to its polarizability. This type of interaction is weak but crucial in understanding the behavior of DNA when it interacts with carbon nanotubes, as has been seen experimentally."}
{"text":"\nThis paper discusses a systematic panoramic survey of M31, including its Southern quadrant out to 150 kpc, and M33. We detect substructure, two new dwarf galaxies, and a faint metal-poor halo. This halo, which can be fit with either a Hernquist model or a power-law, is surprisingly large in scale and extends to 150 kpc, similar to the halo of the Milky Way. Its presence appears to conflict with modern galaxy formation models, making it a puzzle that they must solve. M33 is found to have a comparable extended metal-poor halo structure, thus providing a challenge and constraint for further modeling."}
{"text":"\nThe aim of the research presented in this paper is to investigate how two significant elements of the string theory landscape \u2013 gauge groups and spacetime supersymmetry \u2013 are connected. By analyzing correlations between the two in the context of perturbative heterotic string vacua, several surprising outcomes have been revealed. For instance, there is a relationship between the amount of supersymmetry and the chance of certain gauge groups being realized, with enhanced supersymmetry tending to result in larger-ranked gauge groups. Additionally, almost half of the heterotic landscape is non-supersymmetric yet tachyon-free at tree level; we found that only a small fraction of the landscape displayed supersymmetry at the string level."}
{"text":"\nAn investigation has been conducted to identify objects within the vicinity of the supermassive black hole at the center of the Galaxy that, if consistent with the model of an adiabatically grown SMBH, could provide proof of particle dark matter. It has been hypothesized that stars sufficiently close to the SMBH will capture weakly interactive massive particles (WIMPs), leading to the formation of a dark matter spike and the production of stellar luminosity due to the annihilation of captured WIMPs in the stellar core. Accordingly, if discovered, these stars could act as evidence of dark matter and potentially define the density distribution of the spike. Our study has compared the predicted luminosity from WIMP burning with observed stars close to the Galactic center and, additionally, used the gamma-ray flux from the Galactic center as reported by EGRET to constrain both the dark matter density profile and annihilation cross-section. This anaylysis demonstrates that the EGRET data is consistent with the WIMP burner hypothesis. Further, upcoming high precision measurements from GLAST will indeed bolster our understanding of the aforementioned structure as well as the amount of evidence for these anomalous stars."}
{"text":"\nThis paper examines the features and evolution of the accretion tori formed when two compact objects collide. Upon recognizing these extreme temperature and density levels, neutrino radiation produced by electron and positron capture on nuclei (beta reactions) is primarily used to cool the accreting torus. We consider a methodical treatment of the equation of state which involves analyzing the photodisintegration of helium, beta equilibrium, and neutrino opacities in order to ascertain the disc structure and its alterations over time. We expand upon this by evaluating the chemical equilibrium of the gas which is comprised of helium, free protons, neutrons, electron-positron pairs to figure out the chemical potentials of the individual parts and establish the electron fraction throughout the disc. Our findings suggest that for very high accretion rates (exceeding ten solar masses per second), the inner areas of the disc turn out to be opaque and result in a viscous and thermal instability. This form of instability could be useful in aiding the comprehension of GRB phenomena from an observational angle."}
{"text":"\nThe Galactic diffuse gamma-ray emission generated by accelerated cosmic ray (CR) particles interacting with the interstellar medium is an important source of information about particle spectra in distant regions of the Galaxy, as well as possible exotic processes such as dark matter annihilation or black hole evaporation. This gamma-ray emission can serve as a background for the GLAST Large Area Telescope observations of cosmic sources. To construct a model for this emission, CR propagation theory, measurements of nuclear cross sections, radiation fields, gas distributions and particle spectra are taken into account. Our efforts to improve the GALPROP software and the model of diffuse gamma-ray emission are ongoing. Here we report on the latest progress in these fields, designed to keep up with the influx of new data."}
{"text":"In this article, the mechanisms of high energy photon production within the internal shock model in a Gamma Ray Burst (GRB) fireball are discussed.The results of the study show that if the fraction of shock energy carried by electrons is not very low, then the high energy emission is mostly derived from the leptonic component. However, for very low values of this parameter, the hadronic emission could be as significant or even more than the leptonic one in the GeV-TeV range. Regardless, a much larger amount of energy is needed in the fireball to explain the observed sub-MeV spectrum. Also, for fireballs with higher Lorentz factor cutoff energies are more elevated and emissions up to PeV may escape the internal shocks but are not detectable with current detectors. They are also attenuated by external photons."}
{"text":"\nWe research the influences of soft-gluon resummation, including the precise correlations between final state particles, on the hunt for the Standard Model Higgs boson through $gg\\to H\\to WW\/ZZ \\to 4 leptons$ in the Tevatron and LHC. Lepton kinematics characteristics are compared between NLO (Next-to-Leading Order) calculations and those with resummation effects. For the $H\\to ZZ$ mode, the acceptance of signal events enhanced by roughly 25% in the presence of resummation. Moreover, various observed leptonic distributions are varied. Meanwhile, in the $H\\to WW$ channel, the acceptance rate remain nearly the same, yet certain kinematics distributions change considerably. For improving the accuracy in light of the Higgs boson at hadron colliders, consideration of soft-gluon resummation is essential."}
{"text":"\nIn this study, the past 22 solar cycles (1755-1996) are analyzed by modeling them as a forced and damped harmonic oscillator in order to obtain the physical parameters relevant to amplitude, frequency, phase and decay factor. An autoregressive model is then applied in order to predict the amplitude and period of the next fifteen solar cycles. The accuracy of the prediction is demonstrated by a match between the predicted and observed amplitude of this current solar cycle (23). It is found that the period of the current cycle is 11.73 years. Further predictions are made for future solar cycles, namely for peaks and troughs in sunspot activity, as well as for length of the cycles, ranging from 8.65 to 13.07 years."}
{"text":"This paper introduces an efficient computing approach for simulating nonlinear dynamic systems. Through the combination of first-order low-pass filters and static nonlinearities, with parameters and network topology that could change depending on system variables, the proposed scheme stands out for its fast but accurate computation in comparison to traditional methods. Several examples, mainly from neuroscience, are provided, including phototransduction, photopigment bleaching, and spike generation. Additionally, the proposed computing approach is advantageous in that it has minimal memory requirements, and can facilitate computation on streaming processors such as a GPU."}
{"text":"\nIn this study, we examine 42 open clusters by utilizing wide-field CCD photometry in the BV filter to observe their vivid characteristics. To estimate the clusters' structure and astrophysical parameters, we develop radial density profiles, as well as fitting solar metallicity isochrones to determine the age, reddening, and distance of each. Additionally, we examine the mass function in order to analyze any dynamical state effects, mass segregation, and the total mass and membership in the clusters. We report basic findings for 11 of the 42 open clusters, observing that the angular sizes of the majority of the clusters were 3.2 times larger than the catalogue data indicated, as well as a correlation between the core and limiting radii that increased with the cluster's mass. Furthermore, we see evidence of initial mass segregation in all of the young clusters and dynamical mass segregation in clusters older than approximately 8.5 in log(age) after not less than one relaxation time."}
{"text":"\nThe goal of this research was to examine transit-selected exoplanet candidates from the MACHO survey in order to determine the physical parameters of the host stars. Doppler measurements and high-resolution spectra were used to acquire data on the host star's mass and density and further information such as spin-orbit alignment could be drawn based on the brightness of the star. Our findings revealed that none of the five transiting objects identified were planets, rather, the measured photometric signature of the transit event corresponded to eclipses of stellar objects."}
{"text":"\nIn this article, we look at how anisotropy and magnetic field may be used to induce entanglement in a two-qubit Heisenberg {\\it XY} model for any finite temperature by increasing the external magnetic field beyond some finite critical strength. To understand this behavior, we consider the Wootters concurrence, a computable measure of entanglement for two-qubit states, and apply its generalizations, the MKB concurrences which possess a particular mathematical property, to a four-qubit and then to a six-qubit model. We find that the same behavior can be observed here too. Moreover, it is possible to measure the multipartite MKB concurrences of pure states and thus experimentally verify our theory, namely, that genuine multipartite entanglement can be obtained in any Heisenberg {\\it XY} chain of even number of qubits at a finite temperature, with a strong enough magnetic field."}
{"text":"This paper introduces Zebu, a domain-specific language for improving the robustness of network application protocol implementations. Zebu simplifies the process of manually writing code for message processing, and introduces an efficient way to parse messages using automated stubs generated by a compiler. Furthermore, applications written in Zebu are more reliable due to validation of message structures and consistency checks. We evaluated Zebu's performance using SIP and RTSP tests and found that the language significantly increases the robustness of protocol implementations."}
{"text":"\nWe have conducted an extensive study of star formation around Active Galactic Nuclei with data taken from the near infrared adaptive optics integral field spectrograph SINFONI. Our results show stellar light profiles of a few tens of parsecs with evidence for recent but inactive starbursts 10-300 million years ago. The stellar luminosity in the central 10pc is much lower than the AGN, but comparable on larger scales. Our analysis reveals a steadily increasing surface stellar luminosity density of up to 10^13L_sun\/kpc^2 in the central few parsecs and a mass surface density of 10^4M_sun\/pc^2. We postulate that the starbursts were likely Eddington limited and hence had relatively short lifespans, with a possible delay of 50-100 million years between the onset of star formation and subsequent fuelling of the black hole. The role of stellar ejecta in this process is discussed, suggesting that while a significant mass is ejected from OB winds and supernovae, AGB stars provide the largest mass loss at a slow enough speed to be accreted efficiently."}
{"text":"\nThis article explores the properties of a family of curves, introduced by Andradas, Recio, and Sendra, called hypercircles, which extend the properties of circles to the setting of algebraic extensions. We show that hypercircles can be described as the rational normal curve of a certain degree, and derive explicit formulae for their parametrization and implicitation. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive description of the points at infinity of these curves, which generalizes the cyclic structure of circles at infinity. As the understanding of the properties of hypercircles has implications for the simplification of parametrizations, this article has direct applications in this field."}
{"text":"\nThis study examines the blue straggler population of the globular cluster NGC 1904 (M79) using a multifaceted data collection. The photometric data - ranging from ultraviolet to near infrared - was sourced from both high resolution HST-WFPC2 and ground\/space based 2.2m ESO-WFI and GALEX instruments. After analysing the entire cluster in this way, a total of 39 notably bright blue stragglers ($m_{218}\\le 19.5$) have been distinguished with a highly concentrated distribution in the core region. Contrary to other globular clusters (M 3, 47 Tuc, NGC 6752, M 5) that have been studied with the same method, no major increase in the frequency of blue stragglers in the outer regions of NGC 1904 was observed. This, combined with a comparatively large radius of avoidance ($r_{avoid}\\sim 30$ core radii), leads to the conclusion that dynamic processes of a primordial binary system only make up a minuscule (0-10%) proportion of the overall blue straggler population of NGC 1904."}
{"text":"\nThis presentation will analyze the evidence of a phase transition in finite nuclear systems collected from thermodynamical studies of nuclear sources generated in heavy-ion collisions. It will focus on how the bimodal behavior of the charge of the biggest fragment (Z1) supports this hypothesis. Evaluating the entrance channel effects and with the constraint of a bimodal energy distribution (E*), the canonical description of a phase transition will be used to link the observed bimodal behavior to the residual convexity of the entropy. Comparing theoretical and experimental Z1-E* correlations, this comparison will form the basis for ruling out the case without transition, furthermore supplying us with details about the coexistence area in the Z1-E* plane that is in good agreement with the results acquired in microcanonical negative heat capacity studies."}
{"text":"\nThis study examines the validity of a method to reconstruct the intrinsic triaxial shape of galaxy clusters, proposed by Lee and Kang. We test this algorithm by applying it to the Virgo Cluster and analyze member galaxies from the Virgo Cluster Catalogue. We modify the original algorithm to account for two-dimensional projection, and measure the anisotropy in the spatial distribution of the member galaxies for the projected direction of the major axis of the Virgo cluster. The results reveal an axial ratio of 1:0.54:0.73 and suggest that at smaller radii the shape tends to be more prolate. The findings are consistent with other observational reports, indicating that the reconstructed algorithm is accurate. We also present a discussion on the potential impacts of Virgo cluster's triaxiality on mass estimation."}
{"text":"This study analyzes the propagation of mode I cracks in an icosahedral model quasicrystal by molecular dynamics techniques at low temperature. It specifically examines how the shape of the cleavage plane is affected by the clusters which are an inherent part of the model and how it varies with the plane structure. The research demonstrates a brittle fracture with no indications of dislocation activity, and the crack surfaces appear rough on the scale of the clusters but have an average constant height with respect to high symmetry axes. From detailed analysis of the fractured samples, it is deduced that both the plane structure and the clusters have a considerable impact on dynamic fracture in quasicrystals and should therefore be considered as physical entities."}
{"text":"\nThis paper presents the possibility for the CERN\/GranSasso (CNGS) neutrino complex to search for theta_13 oscillations and CP violation concurrent with T2K and NOvA. A Liquid Argon Imaging Chamber (LAr-TPC) is proposed as the most suitable technology, offering higher detection efficiency and lower backgrounds. MODULAr project proposes a 20 kt fiducial volume detector following the ICARUS-T60o technology, to be placed at least 50000 m3 at 10 km off-axis from the main Laboratory in a location at about 1.2 km equivalent water depth. It will consist of many identical and independent units of 5 kt. There are plans for extensions for future physics goals. Provided a new hall is excavated in the vicinity of the Gran Sasso Laboratory, the experiment might become operational in around 4\/5 years with adequate funding and participation."}
{"text":"This study examines the plastic properties of Al-Mn-Pd approximants xi, xi' and xi'_n of the quasicrystal. It is demonstrated that these phases, as well as their deformed or defected states, can be understood using a projection formalism in three-dimensional space, unlike previously used four to six-dimensional methods. This formalism is then used to explain microstructures observed in electron microscopy, and to determine the most energetically favorable metadislocations in relation to experimentally observed ones. In addition, the notion of a dislocation-induced phase transition from xi' to xi'n is proposed. Lastly, the methods employed in this article can be applied to study other complex metallic alloys."}
{"text":"This present study analyzes the frequency of blue stragglers (BSS), thought to be the product of either primordial or collisional binary systems, in a sample of eightLocal Group non star-forming dwarf galaxies. Utilizing ground and space based photometry and comparing with globular clusters of similar luminosity, we determined the BSS frequency of these galaxies. Our notable results include the higher BSS frequency of dwarf galaxies at any given Mv than globular clusters, agreement with the BSS frequency of the Milky Way halo, and an anti-correlation between the BSS frequency and the galaxy Mv. This analysis suggests that the blue plumes of dwarf galaxies are predominantly composed of primordial binaries rather than young main sequence stars, leading to a higher primordial BSS frequency in dwarf galaxies than expected."}
{"text":"We research the Heisenberg antiferromagnet with an anisotropic form of nearest-neighbor exchange on the Kagome lattice to describe the magnetic properties of volborthite, for which J\/J' > 1. Both classical and large N limit calculations affirm that the system shows a rich phase diagram containing differing magnetic phases; ferrimagnetic, incommensurate, and decoupled chain phases. With the help of analytical calculations, we are able to ascertain boundaries between the phases and other features of the Sp(N) phase diagram. Lastly, a block-spin perturbation expansion being applied to the trimerised version of the spin-1\/2 model leads to the suggestion that in the limit of large anisotropy, J\/J' >> 1, the original model's ground state is a collinearly ordered antiferromagnet, which is divided from the incommensurate state by a quantum phase transition."}
{"text":"A study of the electron ordering and deformation of the Wigner crystal in a one-dimensional quantum dot is presented. By examining the spatial Fourier spectrum of the electron density distribution and the distribution function of electrons across single-particle states, two distinct features of the system are determined. These include a $\\delta$-like singularity at the Fermi momentum $k_F$ in the distribution function and a step-like form at the wavevector $2k_F$, with final harmonics being completely absent or vanishing. These features are established via calculations generated from a exact diagonalization method. It is emphasized that their presence arises from the Wigner ordering of electrons, which is influenced by the boundaries. A modification of the Luttinger liquid model that incorporates a corrected version of the density operator preserving particle number is proposed. This refinement enables one to accurately account for the two dynamic characteristics associated with the system."}
{"text":"\nThe paper by Mao et al. proposed the idea that the angular momentum of large spinning bodies, such as the Earth, might generate a detectable amount of torsion which could be observed by Gravity Probe B. In our paper, we argue that the principle of action equals reaction does not apply to this type of theory, and study a multiple variants of the Einstein-Hayashi-Shirafuji theory proposed by Mao et al. We conclude that none of these variants yield a detectable torsion signal which could be observed by Gravity Probe B. We indicate that there may be other torsion theories which could in principle make predictions which can be tested by Gravity Probe B."}
{"text":"\nThis article investigates the structures of observable galaxies in the Universe and their origin. Using a technique of multilevel dynamic contrasting of luminous objects, the author draws the following conclusions: a) galaxies are highly structured and display a tendency towards self-similarity, as well as tightly packed tubular and cartwheel structures; b) most visible elements in the cosmos are the luminous ends of almost invisible filaments, only visible when viewed close up; c) double galaxies which appear to form in pairs originated from the breaking of similar filaments; d) the galaxies M81 and M82 represent the cutting of two branches of what seems to be a treelike filament, with their interaction occurring via the filament; and e) the dynamics of our universe suggests the formation process of stars and galaxies could be fast enough to be a result of fracturing filaments, as opposed to the existing standard model."}
{"text":"\nWe present here high-resolution U, B, V, R, and I photometry measurements of 81 stellar features within the disk of the barred galaxy NGC 3367. Our images display a variety of structures, suggesting ongoing star formation in different regions of the disk. NGC 3367 possesses a high density of molecular gas and an interesting bipolar radio lobe structure at a distance of 6 kpc, similar to that shown by radio galaxies. Magnitude and color reading have been taken of the nucleus, a region encompassing supernova 2003 AA, and 79 star associations. The difficulty of precisely estimating the ages of star complexes due to a range of characteristics, such as the filling factor, metallicities, spatial distribution, and our decision to base the measurements on a 16 pixel-wide circular aperture of $6''.8\\sim1.4$ kpc diameter, is acknowledged. Nonetheless, the colors of NGC 3367 prove to be close to the colors of star clusters from theoretical evolutionary star tracks envisaged for the LMC, and with a similarly estimated metallicity. Results suggest that more than half of the observed associations belong to the SWB I age class, which ranges from a few tens of million years. Additionally, seven of the sources were located beyond the bright visible disk."}
{"text":"\n\nIn this article, we examine the intricate relationship between chaos and symmetry demonstrated by the inhomogeneous solutions of Einstein-matter systems associated with string theory and M-theory. Using the Belinsky-Khalatnikov-Lifshitz framework, we determine the extent of the chaotic behavior of these systems near the cosmological singularity. Our analysis reveals a connection between the chaotic settings arising from the respective systems and certain infinite-dimensional hyperbolic Kac-Moody algebras. We find that the billiard chambers describing the asymptotic cosmological behavior of Einstein gravity in d+1 dimensions and the metric-three-form system of 11-dimensional supergravity are the same as the Weyl chambers of the Lorentzian Kac-Moody algebras AE_d and E_{10}, respectively. This bolsters the idea that these Kac-Moody algebras serve as hidden symmetries of the corresponding models. Moreover, there is some evidence of a hidden similarity between the general solution of the Einstein-three-form system and a null geodesic in the infinite dimensional E_{10} \/ K(E_{10}) coset space."}
{"text":"\nUsing the data collected by the Very Large Array (VLA), we have managed to detect radio emission within one arcsecond of the globular cluster G1, dubbed Mayall-II, present in M31. According to Gebhardt et al., the cluster consists of an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) estimated to have a mass of ~2x10^4 solar masses. The amount of power detected at 8.4GHz was 2x10^15 W\/Hz. The radio\/X-ray ratio of the detected emission from G1 was a few hundred times higher than those found in normal high-mass X-ray binaries, but lower than what is expected for accretion onto an IMBH with the mass reported in G1. Although a pulsar wind nebula can also explain this result, high-sensitivity VLBI observations will allow us to potentially distinguish between the two options. The Expanded VLA, when it becomes operational in 2010, has the capability to detect similar emission from IMBHs of ~1000-solar-mass in Milky Way globular clusters."}
{"text":"\nWe provide an investigation of the Landau-Lifshitz sigma-models on coset spaces $G\/H$ where $H$ is a maximal stability subgroup of $G$.

We formulate the $PSU(2,2|4)\/PS(U(2|2)^2)$ Landau-Lifshitz sigma-model, which encapsulates the thermodynamic limit of the spin-chain Hamiltonian from the one-loop dilatation operator of the N=4 super Yang-Mills (SYM) theory. Additionally, we explore consistent truncations of the Type IIB Green-Schwarz action on $AdS_5\\times S^5$, formed by two real bosons and 4,8, or 16 real fermions. We demonstrate how $\\kappa$-symmetry is non-functional in the specified sub-sectors and map the Lagrangians of these sub-sectors to the truncations of the $PSU(2,2|4)\/PS(U(2|2)^2)$ Landau-Lifshitz sigma-model under the AdS\/CFT correspondence in the large spin limit."}
{"text":"This article explores the potential dangers of employing an estimator that relies upon the oracle property in the same manner as Hodges' estimator. We use the example of a linear regression model and the SCAD estimator to demonstrate that this type of estimator can have a maximal risk that diverges to infinity when the loss function is unbounded and that its worst-case performance relative to the maximum likelihood estimator can become worse with increasing sample size if it is adjusted to optimize sparsity. Through a Monte Carlo study, we validate these findings in finite sample cases."}
{"text":"\nThis paper examines the surface phase diagram of a two-dimensional fluid of hard rods confined between two rigid lines. Utilizing a density-functional theory based on the Fundamental-Measure Functional and the Zwanzig model for restricted orientation, we discovered that the wall-fluid interface is fully wetted by the columnar phase. Through a first-order transition, confinement between the two walls leads to capillary columnar ordering. For higher chemical potentials, we also identified layering transitions occurring even for narrow slits close to the one-dimensional limit. We conjecture that these surface phenomena could be observed experimentally in two-dimensional systems of rods where external forces can induce vertical motion and excluded volume effects may lead to entropically-maximized packing configurations."}
{"text":"\nThis work studies the implications of the Horava-Witten theory in an environment where the Casimir energy density near one boundary is high (significantly greater than 10^5 in units of the d = 11 gravitational length). This situation gives rise to a 'thick pipe' configuration of TeV-scale gravity that could potentially explain the Four-Dimensional (4D) Universe, as described by the accepted version of the 'ADD mechanism'. Three alternative ways to stabilize the outer surface of the 'thick pipe', for consistency with the observed value of 4D cosmological constant, are suggested. The first alternative suggests that the outer surface would be stabilized in the classical region and the constant of integration set to around 10^13 in the same units. The second proposes that the four observed dimensions have reduced to the same size as the d = 11 gravitational length at the outer surface while the third suggests extra fluxes of the three-form gauge field to stabilize the outer surface in the classical region. The paper also discusses the issues that arise when looking to fit the strong\/electroweak Standard Model into this picture."}

{"text":"\nThe magnetic structure of the intermetallic antiferromagnet Sm2IrIn8 has been studied using x-ray resonant magnetic scattering (XRMS). This technique allowed for the detection of a commensurate antiferromagnetic structure with a propagating vector (1\/2,0,0) at temperatures below the Neel temperature (TN) of 14.2 K. It was found that the Sm magnetic moments have a plane of rotation in the ab plane and are displaced roughly 18 degrees from the a axis. Multiple features were noted at the L2 and L3 edges of the XRMS, with a resonant peak at the L2 edge that was amplified around two orders of magnitude. The crystalline electrical field (CEF) effects were determined to be of particular relevance in determining the direction of magnetic moments and TN evolution in the series. The Neel temperature of Sm2IrIn8 is, however, slightly lower than that of the parent cubic compound SmIn3."}
{"text":"\nExploring top quark flavor-violating interactions at the LHC is of immense importance in measuring the validity of the standard model. By examining the current experimental data from B-Factories in a model-independent fashion, we are able to deduce the constraints on the operators that contribute to FCNC top quark decays. Our analysis suggests that most operators involving left-handed first and second generation quark fields are ruled out at a level observable at the LHC, while there is still significant room for top decays mediated by operators with right-handed charm or up quarks. With such constraints, we can explore deeper into the mysterious new physics that lies beyond the standard model."}
{"text":"This paper examines the infrared properties of three giant low surface brightness (LSB) galaxies using Spitzer Space Telescope observations. We analyze the mid- and far-infrared morphology, spectral energy distributions and colors to obtain the dust mass, dust-to-gas mass ratio, infrared luminosity and star formation rate. The 8 micron images show evidence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the central regions, however the diffuse optical disks remain undetected. The estimated dust-to-gas ratios range from less than 10^-3 to 10^-2. The total infrared luminosity is approximately 1\/3 to 1\/2 of the blue band luminosity, suggesting that old stellar cultures are the main source of dust heating. The star formation rate estimated from the infrared data is approximately 0.01-0.88 M_sun yr^-1, congruent with optical results."}
{"text":"In this article, I investigate the role of taste violations in the results of calculations involving staggered baryonic quantities, presenting a mapping of the Symanzik action into heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory. By calculating the masses of flavor-symmetric nucleons to the third order in both partially quenched and fully dynamical staggered chiral perturbation theory for two plus one dynamical quark flavors, I explain the effects of taste symmetry breaking, the resultant degeneracies, and mixings. The resulting chiral forms are applicable to lattice results obtained with currently used operators, and could be used to analyze the restoration of taste symmetry in the continuum limit.

{"text":"\nThis article re-examines the magnetic fields of stars of the upper main sequence, focusing on those with precise Hipparcos parallaxes and accurately determined longitudinal magnetic fields. We observe that stars with masses below 3 M_sun concentrate closer to the main-sequence band, while those above 3 M_sun tend to be closer to the Zero Age Main Sequence (ZAMS). From study of stars in nearby open clusters, we find that higher temperatures, younger ages, larger masses and shorter rotation periods are associated with increased magnetic fields strength. We also note that while the magnetic flux remains constant during the star's main sequence life, the distribution of obliquity angles beta appears to be random at first but then when the star is observable on the H-R diagram, either 0 or 90 degrees is more common for stars of mass lower than 3 M_sun. Though there is a hint of increases in beta with effect of the main sequence passage for stars with a mass higher than 3 M_sun, no such trend is established in stars with lower masses."}
{"text":"\nIn this thesis, a sequence of results is presented towards a description of a tensor category of trivalent graphs that is equivalent to the representation category of the quantum group U_q(sl_n). It is a partial answer to a question posed by Greg Kuperberg in q-alg\/9712003 and again by Justin Roberts as problem 12.18 in \"Problems on Invariants of Knots and 3-Manifolds\", math.GT\/0406190, regarding a possible diagrammatic representation of the spherical category of U_q(sl_n) representations. A diagrammatic forgetful functor is constructed to establish an inductive approach that reveals both classes of elements in the kernel, as well as obstructions which form its conjecture.

{"text":"\nUsing ACS\/HST coronagraphic observations in the F435W, F606W, and F814W bands, we observe the dust surrounding HD 100546, a B9.5 star, 103 pc away from the Sun. Measurements out to a distance of 14'' are consistent with the presence of an extended, flat nebula that has the same inclination as the inner disk. The well-known ``spiral arms'' are clearly seen along with other fainter features that have not previously been reported. Interestingly, the brightness of the inter-arm space increases, but the colors of the structures become more neutral as the wavelengths increase, which is not predicted by models of a warped disk. We note a similarity between the colors of the disk and those seen in Kuiper Belt objects and explore a number of hypotheses to explain them, including asymmetric scattering, reddening, and large minimum sizes on ISM-like grains. We conclude that none of these theories can explain the colors alone and suggest that we are only seeing the optically thin envelope of the disk. The colors indicate that this nebulosity is not a remnant of the infalling envelope but reprocessed disk material."}
{"text":"\nThe aim of this article is to explore how Abelian topologically massive gauge theories (TMGT) in any spacetime dimension can be canonically quantised in a manner which maintains gauge invariance. Firstly, by using the Hamiltonian formulation, it is possible to divide the phase space into two orthogonal sectors using an appropriate canonical transformation. The first sector consists of canonically conjugate gauge invariant variables with free massive excitations describing the TMGT system. The second sector, decoupled from the total Hamiltonian, contains the analogous phase-space description of a non-dynamical pure topological field theory. Secondly, within canonical quantisation, the total TMGT states can be factorised in a consistent, gauge-invariant way. This factorisation also enables TMGT to be projected onto topological quantum field theories in a transparent manner, which does not require any gauge-fixing procedure."}
{"text":"\nThis research aimed to measure the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of the sintered silicon carbide (SiC), SiC-100, for use in cryogenic infrared space-telescopes. Three samples, #1, #2, and #3, were taken from blocks of SiC created in different batches and their thermal expansion was measured using a cryogenic dilatometer in a temperature range extending from room temperature to around 10 K. Results revealed an average CTE of 0.816 and a dispersion of 0.002 (expressed as x10^-6\/K). No major discrepancies were documented between the CTE of the three samples from separate batches, and no inhomogeneity or anisotropy was observed. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this precise CTE measurement, a finite-element-method (FEM) analysis was completed to analyze the thermal deformation of a 3.5 m diameter cryogenic mirror consisting of six SiC-100 segments, which showed that it has a high enough accuracy for the design of the Space Infrared telescope for Cosmology and Astrophysics (SPICA)."}
{"text":"\nBy running a Monte Carlo simulation based on a nonlinear algorithm, we explore the impact of Compton scattering on the H-like, He-like and neutral Fe K alpha lines produced in the post-shock region of the accretion column of magnetic cataclysmic variables (mCVs). The peak line emissivities and frequency shifts due to Doppler effects are taken into account. The results reveal that line profiles are most notably distorted in mCVs that possess a low white dwarf mass, a high mass accretion rate, andare observed at an inclination angle. This distortion is not significantly altered by changes in the column width or the emissivity profile. Our simulations have been compared to Chandra\/HETGS observations of GK Per, suggesting that a wing feature redward of the 6.4 keV line likely originates from Compton recoil close to the bottom of the accretion column."}

{"text":"\nThrough a series of high-resolution 3D SPH calculations incorporating realistic viscosity and sound-speed prescriptions, we present comprehensive simulations of the eccentric instability which drives the superhump phenomenon in semi-detached binaries. Our improved simulations provide a closer match to the observed relationship between superhump period and binary mass ratio than previously. We demonstrate the importance of the two-armed spiral mode in the generation of superhump, and compare 2D and 3D results concluding that 3D simulations are essential for accurate depiction of disc dynamics. Moreover, we show that the dissipation caused by converging flows which lead to spiral shocks powers each superhump cycle. By running simulations for unprecedented durations, we establish that varying viscosity and eccentricity distributions are responsible for the disc actively participating in the eccentricity. Additionally, the modulation of total viscous dissipation on the superhump period is found to be largely within the 3:1 resonance radius. Collectively, this provides further evidence in favour of the thermal-tidal instability model."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate the impact of non-gravitational phenomena on cosmological shock waves produced by supersonic structures in a $\\Lambda$CDM concordance universe. Our model takes into account cooling and photoionization of gases, as well as superwind feedbacks, to calculate thermalisation and cosmic-ray acceleration efficiencies. We then evaluate the gas thermal energy dissipation and cosmic-ray energy dissipated at these shocks over the evolution of the universe. We also analyse the vorticity created at curved shocks in cosmological simulations, and find that gravitational forces are the primary influence on the energetics and dynamics of these shocks, and non-gravitational forces make a minor difference. This suggests that intracluster and intergalactic media may contain non-thermal particles, turbulence and vorticity generated mostly from shock waves."}
{"text":"\n\nAnalysis of Hubble Space Telescope and Spitzer Space Telescope observations of Uranus- and Neptune-crossing object (65489) Ceto\/Phorcys (provisionally designated 2003 FX128) has revealed it to be a close binary system. The period and semimajor axis of the mutual orbit enabled determination of the system's mass, effective radius and albedo, which along with thermal emission estimations resulted in an average bulk density of 1.37 + 0.66\/-0.32 g cm^-3. This is higher than that determined for three similarly-sized outer Solar System binaries and closer to the density of the saturnian irregular satellite Phoebe. Additionally, the orbit is near-circular with an eccentricity of <= 0.015, as predicted by theoretical calculations concerning how the system will evolve via tidal forces over a timescale shorter than the age of the solar system."}
{"text":"This article examines the $p d \\to p d \\eta$ reaction in the energy range where new data from Uppsala is available. To incorporate the $\\eta -d$ final state interaction, we solve the Lippmann Schwinger equation using an elastic scattering matrix element of half-offshell form factor given by an effective range expansion up to the fourth power in momentum. The parameters for the expansion were taken from a Faddeev equation solution for the $\\eta NN$ system which was based on different $\\eta-N$ scattering amplitudes. We also  generated $T_{\\eta d \\to \\eta d}$ from few-body equations employing the FRA. The $p-d$ final state interaction is included by multiplying the matrix element with the inverse of the Jost function according to the Watson-Migdal prescription. From the findings we deduce that the $\\eta-d$ interaction is dominant in the region of small invariant $\\eta -d$ mass, $M_{\\eta d}$, while the $p-d$ interaction affects the cross section in all areas of $M_{\\eta d}$. Examination of the angular distributions of protons and deuterons in the final state show that they are nearly isotropic. These results are in agreement with experimental data, indicating that the two-step model is the dominant mechanism of $\\eta$ production."}
{"text":"This article examines the current-carrying capabilities of type-II superconductors in a state known as a Bose glass. An analytical computation of a material's tilt modulus is used to evaluate the strength of a broken Bose glass state, which allows it to maintain its form even in the presence of weak, point pinning. The study suggests that the critical current of these superconductors is dependent on the sample's thickness, and can transition between two and three dimensional behaviour as a result. Additionally, it is shown that the film thickness needed for this transition may be larger than what is indicated through the point pinning strength. Comparisons are drawn between the results of the study and high-temperature superconductors being developed for wire technology to validate its findings."}
{"text":"\nThe present study investigates the effects of large-$q$ state Potts model ferromagnetic interactions on the optimal cooperation among agents in a dynamically evolving network. Exact mathematical analysis reveals that the general homogeneous form of this model produces a strongly first-order phase transition.

Numerical simulations of the Barab\\'asi-Albert network presents the shift and width exponents of the transition to be 1\/\u0164ilde\u009d'=.26(1) and 1\/\u009d'=.18(1) respectively.

It additionally considers the existence of nonholonomic evolution operators and examines the reversibility of the evolution operator, as well as the discrete nonholonomic momentum equation. Examples of various applications of the theory are discussed, including the discrete nonholonomic constrained particle, the Suslov system, the Chaplygin sleigh, the Veselova system, the rolling ball on a rotating table, and the two wheeled planar mobile robot."}
{"text":"\nIn this article, we discuss two fundamental quantum phenomena that arise from\ninteractions between electrons and lattice vibrations: in three-dimensional systems, a metal can turn into a superconductor and in one-dimensional systems, it can turn an insulator. In two dimensions, the mechanisms that cause these phenomena, leading to charge-density waves (CDWs) and superconductivity, respectively, are less understood than those in higher dimensionalities. We discuss the finding that an anomalous pseudogap \u2013 an energy gap that remains unclosed even above the transition temperature \u2013 exists in a particularly studied two-dimensional compound, dichalcogenide 2H-TaSe2, and that the formation of CDW is driven by a conventional nesting instability, one that is traditionally masked by the pseudogap. These findings shed light onto a number of unusual experimental responses, as well as disproving many alternative theoretical propositions. Furthermore, the magnitude, character and anisotropy of the 2D-CDW pseudogap are strikingly similar to those seen in superconducting cuprates. We use high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) to investigate these two phenomena in 2D systems, as two of the most baffling puzzles in condensed matter physics remain."}
{"text":"\nExploring the electronic structures, the equilibrium geometries, and the properties of finite temperature with the help of density-functional theory, we have studied Na_n clusters (n=39-55). Our findings point to a clear pattern of growth in the ground-state geometries, with the clusters from the beginning of the series (n=39-43) exhibiting symmetric, partial icosahedral structures, followed by disordered structures (n=44-52). Remarkably, for clusters with sizes larger than 52, the icosahedral core reappears. DFT molecular dynamics were used to calculate heat capacity curves for the representative sizes of n=43, 45, 48, and 52. Comparing the results of these to the available thermodynamic calculations for n=40, 50, and 55, we observe compelling evidence of a connection between the geometry evolution and the shapes of the heat capacity curves. Moreover, our research confirms the dependence of the heat capacities on cluster size."}
{"text":"\nIn this study, we analyze low-resolution mid-IR spectra of 25 luminous QSOs between 2 < z < 3.5 and a sample of local, low luminosity type-I AGNs. Combining these two, we span five orders of magnitude in luminosity. Our findings indicate that the dust covering factor decreases with increasing luminosity and anti-correlates with the [OIII]5007A lin luminosity, likely due to less absorption in higher luminosity AGNs. Additionally, the silicate emission is correlated with luminosity, appearing in the most luminous spectra obtained yet. PAH emission features are not detected, implying a saturation of the correlation between AGN power and star formation rate at high luminosities."}
{"text":"\nIn this paper, we investigate the evolution of IR galaxy features using the Lambda-CDM cosmological model and semi-analytical galaxy formation theory. Specifically, we analyze the luminosity function, number counts and redshift distributions based on the GALFORM, GRASIL and SPITZER Space Telescope data. The model, already established by Baugh et al (2005), assumes two distinct initial mass functions (IMF): one is standard for constant star formation in the disks, the other is extremely top-heavy for starbursts launched by galaxy mergers. Previous studies have demonstrated that the high-mass IMF is necessary to explain the number of faint sub-mm galaxies. When tested against SPITZER data with fixed parameter values, the model adequately reproduces the IR evolution over the full range of SPITZER wavelengths. Evidently, the mid-IR luminosity function shows strong evolution from z=0 to z=2 and our results without adjusting any model parameters accurately track the changes. On the contrary, the 'normal IMF' version for starbursts proves to be underperforming in capturing the mid-IR luminosity evolution and is hence ruled out."}
{"text":"\nThis paper presents the development of the ISLES library, a set of C functions for accurately computing the  potential and flux influences of singularities on triangular and rectangular elements. The neBEM solver is then demonstrated to be a powerful and efficient method for solving a variety of scientific and technical issues. It is shown that the exact computations of uniform singularity distributions on triangular elements provide highly accurate results, which are compared against the most reliable available data. Furthermore, a case study is conducted to assess the accuracy and timing of the proposed expressions against quadrature methods. Finally, the capacitance of a unit square plate raised to a unit voltage is attacked using the neBEM solver and the resulting data is compared to the literature. This comparison illustrates the smooth and converging charge density close to the corner of the plate, which is a highlight for the neBEM solver."}
{"text":"\nThis paper investigates the influence of solar corona on the diminution of small-amplitude prominence oscillations. The energy equation, containing thermal conduction, optically thin or thick radiation and heating, is assessed to analyze their contribution to the reduction in oscillations. The dispersive approach is used to acquire a complex oscillatory frequency, which allows to compute the period and amount of damping. The study reveals that radiation losses from the prominence plasma affect the internal slow mode, while a combination of prominence radiation and coronal conduction reduce the fast mode. Coronal conduction alone weakens the external slow mode. The results of this research suggests non-adiabatic effects are productive damping mechanisms for magnetoacoustic waves, and the obtained damping times values comply with those observed."}
{"text":"This research explores the concept of one-way permutations and how it relates to computational asymmetry and distortion. We introduce a computational asymmetry function to measure the extent of one-wayness of permutations, as well as a word-length asymmetry function for groups. We identify a relationship between Boolean circuits, words in a Thompson monoid, and elements of a Thompson group, which equate to the circuit size and word-length. Additionally, we demonstrate that circuits composed of gates that are not restricted to fixed-length inputs and outputs, can be up to quadratically more compact than traditional circuits. Finally, we uncover that the computational asymmetry function is strongly related to certain distortion functions, such as the path length in Schreier graphs of certain Thompson groups versus the path length in Cayley graphs of certain Thompson monoids. Furthermore, we prove that Razborov and other's results on monotone circuit complexity yield exponential lower bounds for specific distortions."}
{"text":"This paper presents a new method for determining the exact surface gravity of transiting extrasolar planets. It is based on the spectroscopic orbit of its parent star, along with information from its transit light curve. This approach does not require any knowledge of stellar models or atmospheres, and often yields results that are more precise than measurements of the planet's mass, radius, and density. We use HD 209458b to demonstrate the method and demonstrate that the planet has a lower surface gravity than previously thought. Additionally, we look at all known transiting extrasolar planets and find a correlation between surface gravity and orbital period, which may be tied to the mass-period correlation. This further shows the importance of being able to measure surface gravity as it may be connected to the evaporation of planetary atmospheres."}
{"text":"\nThis paper presents a catalog of 451 star cluster candidates in M33, 255 of which have been confirmed through HST and high resolution ground-based imaging. Our catalog includes precise data for each cluster such as positions, magnitudes and colors, metallicities, radial velocities, masses and ages, and galactocentric distances. The color distribution of the M33 clusters appears similar to those of the large Magellanic Cloud, where major peaks are located at B-V of 0.15 and 0.65. Additionally, results from this analysis indicate a correlation between the clusters' ages and intrinsic colors with younger clusters tending to be more metal-rich. The radial profile of the M33 clusters is also more concentrated than that of the field stars, suggesting that a more comprehensive search of the area is needed; we discuss potential reasons for this conclusion."}
{"text":"\nThis study examined the properties of 88 nearby SDSS-DR4 galaxy clusters, analyzing the mean recessional velocity, velocity dispersion, and virial radius of each one. A sample of 10,865 galaxies were divided into two categories based on their $u-r$ colours. Early-type (red) galaxies were found in the inner regions of the clusters and showed lower velocity dispersion, while late-type (blue) galaxies were located toward the outer regions and had decreasing velcoity dispersion profiles. Additionally, a correlation between the fraction of blue galaxies and the X-ray luminosity was discovered, but not between fraction of blue galaxies and cluster velocity dispersion or galaxy concentration. These results suggest that it is the local environment that is most influential in driving the evolution of galaxies in low mass clusters, while both the global and local environment in high mass clusters can have a role in the evolution process."}
{"text":"This paper examines Gaussian valence bond states generated from a projection of an auxiliary space containing M joined pairs of links attached at each of N sites within a harmonic chain. By manipulating the input level of entanglement of a (2M+1)-mode Gaussian component known as the building block, we investigate the transmission of entangled bonds throughout the system. To illustrate, we illustrate an optical method of creating symmetrical three-mode Gaussian building blocks (which signify a single bond, M=1) and review the entanglement structure in the output Gaussian valence bond states. Lastly, we comment on how these states can be employed for continuous variable quantum communication protocols such as telecloning and teleportation networks."}
{"text":"We explore the challenge of evaluating the unconditional distribution of a post-model-selection estimator. This deals with the combined approach that first involves the selection of a model (e.g., with AIC criterion or by hypothesis testing) and then leads to the estimation of the parameters in that chosen model (e.g., via least-squares or maximum likelihood). Our findings reveal that it is very difficult to guarantee reasonable accuracy of the charged unconditional distribution even in the asymptotic case. We show that there is no estimator that is uniformly consistent and that the performance of the estimators of this distribution, as measured by the probability of exceeding a certain threshold, is bounded at a large level of 1\/2 or even 1. This applies to the distribution of linear functions (e.g., predictors) from a post-model-selection estimator, come to the same conclusions."}
{"text":"\nWe present a novel approach to determine jet\/disk dominance in Type 1 Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) by exploring the correlation between X-ray spectral features observed through the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer. Our study, comprising nine years of time-resolved spectra from 350 Seyfert galaxies, finds a possible connection between the iron line equivalent width and the underlying power law index. It appears that the lower the power law index, the higher the iron line equivalent width, suggesting the diminishing of the disk spectrum by a beamed jet component. We additionally observe a strong correlation between the reflection fraction and Gamma, though this may be caused by modeling degeneracies. Finally, we discover the X-ray Baldwin effect, which shows an anti-correlation between 2-10 keV X-ray luminosity and EW for the sample as a whole but not for the individual galaxies or galaxy types. Thus, this study provides a viable method of determining jet\/disk dominance in type 1 AGN."}
{"text":"\nUsing an effective, model-independent approach, we examine the influence of flavour-dependent aspects on Type II Leptogenesis. This type of leptogenesis includes an additional direct mass term for the light neutrinos, which is usually provided by the vacuum expectation value of a Higgs triplet. We analyze the bound on the flavour-specific decay asymmetry, on the mass of the lightest right-handed neutrino and on the reheat temperature of the early universe in the type II seesaw frameworks. We find that the leptogenesis in type II seesaw models is more efficient when the mass scale of the light neutrinos is large and the bounds are relaxed. In contrast, type I seesaw scenarios become more constricted with flavour-dependent effects taken into account. Finally, we demonstrate that in general, flavour-dependent effects should not be dismissed when considering type II leptogenesis."}
{"text":"\nThis study examines the VIMOS VLT Deep Survey (VVDS) to measure the Galaxy Stellar Mass Function of galaxies with redshifts as high as 2.5. After evaluating the stellar mass from a two-step approach involving broad-band photometry, it was discovered that low-mass galaxies (<10^9 Msun) are predominantly composed of faint blue galaxies with a magnitude of M_I-M_K = 0.3. Also revealed is that the stellar mass function slowly changes up to z=0.9, but more significantly after that. Additionally, a massive tail is seen up to z=2.5 displaying hues of M_I-M_K=0.7-0.8. We even concluded that there is a reduction in the amount of galaxies at all masses from today to a redshift of 2 (with a percentage of 59+-5% for M >10^8 Msun at z=1). Subsequently, a mass-dependent example of evolution (mass-downsizing) was present as well, demonstrating mild-to-no modification of massive galaxies in number and mass density up to z=0.7; for less massive systems, the no-transformation scenario is not included. By concluding that a large proportion of maximal galaxies were formed before the redshift of 1, \"dry mergers\" were ruled out as the predominant method of development. Low-mass gravitational systems have progressively diminished in both numbers and mass density, verifying an extended mass assembly even at z<1."}
{"text":"\nThis paper studies the possibility of detecting and measuring changes in linear polarization of different X- and gamma-ray spectral energy ranges that arise from multiple astrophysical sources. Of particular interest is the PoGOLite balloon-experiment and the 25-100 keV range of radiation. Using Geant4 simulations, we analyze hypothetical photon spectra based on Cygnus X-1 and accreting magnetic pulsars, with effective times of 6 and 35 hours which correspond to a standard and long duration flight. We compare simulated energy-dependent and constant polarization signals to identify any departures from the constant polarization scenario. Results of the comparative analysis indicated that, in the case of Cygnus X-1, energy-dependent polarization can be detected when the reflected component is assumed to be completely polarized. Inversely, the simulated spectra of accreting pulsars, depending on the degree of polarization, could enable rejection of constant polarization in the case of an energy concentrated signal with at least 50% polarization, and for a decrease from 30% to 0%."}
{"text":"\nSwift and Konus-Wind observations of GRB 061121 (z=1.314), one of the brightest long bursts ever detected, found evidence for an emitted energy of 2.8x10^53 erg over the energy range between 1keV - 10MeV observed in the GRB's rest frame. Additionally, an X-ray flare comparable to previous results was detected, suggesting spectral evolution throughout the burst, which was characterized by a flat SED and a positive correlation between brightness and hardness. The optical-to-X-ray spectra could also be modelled best by a broken, rather than single, power-law. Later on a jet break was seen at ~2x10^5s and lead to an estimated beaming-corrected gamma-ray energy of ~10^51 erg. Observations of the prompt and afterglow phases of GRB 061121 enabled the detection of different spectral lags respectively, and both lags were found to be consistent with the lag-luminosity correlation for long bursts."}
{"text":"The last few decades have seen a renewed interest in the Burgers equation, an equation initially introduced by J.M. Burgers in the 1930s. This revived focus has predominantly been on the study of Burgers turbulence, which looks at solutions to the one- or multi-dimensional Burgers equation in relation to random initial conditions or random external forces. Such research has been driven by various applications of the Burgers equation in fields such as statistical physics, cosmology, and fluid dynamics. The subsequent developments in the study of Burgers turbulence have seen a number of benefits, including progress in the areas of random Lagrangian systems, stochastic partial differential equations, their invariant measures, applications of field theory to the understanding of dissipative anomalies and multi-scaling in hydrodynamic turbulence. This review is intended to provide an overview of relevant work from these related fields of study."}
{"text":"\nThis paper presents a new, analytical approach to the evaluation of the effect of X-ray scattering (XRS) on the imaging quality of grazing-incidence X-ray telescopes. The analysis focuses on the Half Energy Width (HEW), which describes the focusing performance of X-ray optics and is typically an increasing function of photon energy. Since upcoming telescopes such as SIMBOL-X, NeXT, Constellation-X, and XEUS will operate in the hard X-ray band (beyond 10 keV), the contribution of XRS to the HEW may become a major obstacle. The proposed formalism enables the translation of measured surface roughness power spectral densities (PSD) into a HEW trend and vice versa. The maximum tolerable microroughness level can be inferred from a given HEW requirement and energy range of the telescope. Through solving the inverse problem, the PSD of the mirror can also be directly evaluated from a measured HEW function. Thus, the new approach provides an analytical and widely applicable solution to assessing the XRS contribution to the HEW."}
{"text":"This paper presents the development of a dynamical coupled-channel model to analyze electromagnetic meson production reactions in the nucleon resonance region, focusing on $\\pi N$ scattering.

{"text":"\nThis work aimed to clarify the nature of the flattened gas distribution that was suggested to be a 350-AU-radius massive protostellar disk surrounding the young stellar object HW2 in the nearby Cepheus A East star-forming region. Interferometry at high-resolution was utilized to discern high-density and shock tracers, such as methyl cyanide and silicon monoxide, towards that point. The molecular gas was discovered to be due to three protostellar objects overlapping two-dimensionally on the plane of the sky and at least one of them powering an outflow at a minor angle relative to the line of sight. The likelihood of the existence of a protostellar disk in HW2 cannot be established yet, but chances of verifying it may increase if closer spatial scale or different molecular tracers are used."}
{"text":"\nWe present numerical results and theoretical arguments suggesting the existence of long-range correlations in polymer melts and concentrated polymer solutions. These correlations can be attributed to the incompressibility of the melt, and cause short-chain segments to swell. We find that the segmental size distribution deviates from ideal behavior in a way that is proportional to the repulsive force $u(s) \\approx s\/\\rho R^3(s) \\approx ce\/\\sqrt{s}$ between two segments of length $s$. Close analysis of the moments of the distribution allows for the precise calculation of an effective bond length $be$ and a swelling coefficient $ce$. These results are notably different from Flory's hypothesis of short-range decay, as we find that bond-bond correlation functions decrease algebraically as $1\/s^{3\/2}$ when two bonds are separated by $s$ monomers along the chain. We further discuss the effects of finite chain length."}
{"text":"\nWith the advances made in quantum transport far from equilibrium over the past two decades, a combination of the Landauer approach and non-equilibrium Green function (NEGF) method have provided a unified description of many kinds of nanoscale devices, from molecular conductors to carbon nanotubes and silicon transistors. With this model, I explore the possible application of creating a nanodevice that uses a 'demon' to achieve preferential electron transport and thereby energy conversion. This model could be used to analyze examples such as thermoelectric effects and pentalayer spin-torque devices, and may have real-world applications as an engine or a refrigerator, though at the moment this is just an academic discussion. My aim is to emphasize the essential role demons have in out of equilibrium transport and energy conversion and to illustrate the effectiveness of this model with such nanodevices."}
{"text":"\nThis paper examines the mixing time of a systematic scan Markov chain for sampling from the uniform distribution of 7 colours on a finite rectangular sub-grid of the infinite square lattice, the grid. The systematic scan Markov chain cycles through 2x2 sub-grids to update the colour assignments to the vertices of the sub-grids using a technique known as heat-bath. We use computer-assisted proof to show that the chain mixes in O(log n) scans, where n is the size of the rectangular sub-grid. This is the first time rapid mixing of a systematic scan Markov chain has been demonstrated for less than 8 colours on the grid. In addition, our partial results help to highlight the challenges of proving rapid mixing of the chain for 6-colourings of the grid in the case of 2x3 and 3x3 sub-grids."}
{"text":"\nThis article examines the concept of thin elastic shells with a variable thickness in relation to lithospheric flexure of one-plate planets. The equations that govern the deformations and stresses of a spherical shell with changing properties are derived. This leads to a solution in which the variables of transverse deflection and stress functions can be calculated. Furthermore, an approach to include loading generated by mantle convection is addressed, along with evidence that shows that toroidal tangential displacement may occur without toroidal loads when the thickness of the shell varies. In addition, it is proven that the degree-one harmonic components of the transverse deflection and of the toroidal tangential displacement are independent of the elasticity of the shell, and are associated with translational and rotational freedom. This study provides insight into how to better predict the gravity signal in local admittance studies, as well as create stress maps in tectonic analysis."}
{"text":"\nXMM-Newton observed CXOU J164710.2-455216, a candidate magnetar, in the Westerlund 1 region, four days before and one and a half days after two remarkable events detected by Swift on 2006 September 21. These included a 20 ms burst with an energy of 1e37 erg (15-150 keV), and a rapid spin-down (glitch) with a fractional period change of 1e-4. The pulsar's luminosity increased by a factor of 100 between the two observations, its spectrum hardened, and the count rate of its pulses rose by a factor of 10. Its fractional rms amplitude decreased from 65 to 11 per cent, and its pulse profile went from single-peaked to exhibiting three peaks. This behavior is similar to that of other magnetars in response to outbursts, such as that of 1E 2259+586 in 2002 June. It is suggested that a plastic deformation of the neutron star's crust led to a tiny twist in its external magnetic field, creating currents in the magnetosphere that were the direct cause of the X-ray outburst."}
{"text":"The present study presents evidence which suggests that the redshifts of AGN galaxies could include an intrinsic component. This work supports the decreasing intrinsic redshift (DIR) model, which suggests that these galaxies are formed as compact objects with large intrinsic components ejected from mature AGN galaxies and then gradually increase in luminosity as the intrinsic components diminish. This is further supported by the fact that low-redshift AGN galaxies were found to be clearly sub-luminous compared to mature AGN galaxies. Evidence found in the DIR model for increasing luminosity below the redshift of 0.06 was also examined. It is unclear if this could be explained by selection effects in the cosmological redshift (CR) model, as this would be difficult to explain at the low redshift in question."}
{"text":"\nThis paper presents light curves, rotational periods and phase functions for a sample of large Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOS) including the dwarf planet Eris (2003 UB313). 2004 TY364 shows a double-peaked light curve of 11.70+-0.01 hours and with peak-to-peak amplitude of 0.22+-0.02 magnitudes. While 2003 VS2 has a 7.41+-0.02 hour period with 0.21+-0.02 magnitude range. The remaining 7 KBOs in the sample have no discernible variations. Additionally, 2004 TY364, Orcus and 2004 GV9 possess fairly steep linear phase curves between 0.1 and 1.5 degrees, with a slightly shallower (0.09+-0.03 mags per degree) for the large Eris. The absolute magnitudes for these objects are also determined and are a few tenths different from those listed by the Minor Planet Centre. These results indicate that the surface properties of the largest dwarf planets in the Kuiper Belt might be different from its smaller counterparts due to the ability of the larger objects to retain volatile ices as well as maintain an atmosphere."}
{"text":"\nUsing high resolution spectroscopy, we studied U Gem in quiescence and sought evidence of a hot spot or gas stream around the outer perimeter of the accretion disk. Instead, we observed strong narrow emission near the secondary star. We derived the orbital parameters by comparing observations in the ultraviolet spectral range and measuring radial velocities of the double-peaked H$\\alpha$ emission line and its wings, yielding K_em = 107+\/-2 km\/s and K_abs = 310+\/-5 km\/s. Comparing TiO bands to those of late M-type stars suggests a best fit by a M6V star contributing 5 percent of total light. Using the inclination angle from Zhang & Robinson (1987), our measurements imply that the primary is a white dwarf (1.20+\/-0.05 M_sun), the secondary is a red dwarf (0.42+\/-0.04 M_sun) and the separation of their orbits is 1.55+\/- 0.02 R_sun. Furthermore, we calculated that the accretion disk is filling the Roche lobe of the primary, and the matter exiting the L_1 point is most likely impacting the disk directly, resulting in the hot spot we did not observe."}
{"text":"\nWe analyze acceleration in the flat cosmological model with a conformally coupled phantom field to explore the route to Lambda in this type of cosmology. We reduce the model to a 3-dimensional dynamical system and study the behavior on an invariant 2-dimensional submanifold, finding that the concordance FRW model with the cosmological constant $\\Lambda$ is a global attractor situated on the 2-dimensional space. By examining the system near this attractor, we find that trajectories of the conformally coupled phantom scalar field with a simple quadratic potential cross the cosmological constant barrier infinitely many times in the phase space, giving a dynamical mechanism of concentration of the equation of state coefficient around the value of $w_{\\text{eff}}=-1$. We thus demonstrate a route to Lambda through the infinite times crossings of the $w_{\\text{eff}}=-1$ phantom divide."}
{"text":"\nThe injection of galactic short-lived radionuclides, such as 60Fe found in meteorites, is thought to have been sourced from a nearby supernova. In this study, we consider an alternative hypothesis to the initial model of supernova shock triggering the Solar System's protoplanetary collapse, wherein the supernova would directly inject the radioactive material into a pre-existing disk. Through numerical simulations we examine the potential for the disk to be disrupted, and the amount of original gas or dust-phase ejecta that could be mixed in. Results indicate the disk's high pressure can contain the shock wave, resulting in low (<1%) levels of mass loss due to Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities, carrying with it around 1% of injected jet material. This is too inefficient for gas-ejection to account for meteoritic radionuclide abundances, however, the more effectively injected dust-phase materials are more likely to reach the disk and seem to explain the short-lived isotope data. Thus the meteoritic abundances of 60Fe, indicate that condensed dust grains can be injected into a protoplanetary disk as a result of a very close (<1pc) supernova."}
{"text":"\nIn this article, we analyze the influence of peculiar velocities of Type Ia supernovae on our understanding of cosmological parameters. Using data from the Supernova Legacy Survey first-year cosmology report and the IRAS PSCz galaxy redshift survey, we compare equations and models involving the motion of the Local Group in the CMB frame with the supposition that local supernovae are at rest. We test this assumption and examine the impact of velocity corrections to local SNe with three beta models and assess the quality of the fits on the basis of chi^2 values. The best outcome is generated by the beta=0.5 model, which compares favorably with previous peculiar velocity studies. Accounting for these velocities could potentially lead to changes up to 0.04 in w and -0.04 in Omega_Lambda, with Omega_m at the most displaying an alteration of less than 0.01. Using the preferred flow model generates cosmological parameters of w=-1.08, Omega_m=0.27 (under the assumption of a flat universe), and Omega_Lambda=0.80 (for the LambdaCDM)."}
{"text":"\nThis study demonstrates that the critical nearest neighbor Coulomb interaction for the case of 1\/4-filled band within the interacting electron model Hamiltonian varies with spin. As a result, cooling temperature can lead to a transition from a Wigner crystal charge ordering to a spin-Peierls state, comprising of a Bond-Charge-Density Wave (with charge occupancies which differ from that of the Wigner crystal). Ultimately, this could explain some of the recent experiments with 2:1 cationic salts of tetramethyltetrathiafulvalene (TMTTF) and tetramethyltetraselenafulvalene (TMTSF); such as the occurrence of two distinct antiferromagnetic phases, but only a single spin-Peierls phase - where the antiferromagnetic phases are formed either of the Wigner crystal or the Bond-Charge-Spin-Density Wave charge occupancies, the spin-Peierls phase is formed of the Bond-Charge-Density Wave."}
{"text":"\nIn this paper, we analyze an AGN sample obtained from the first epoch VVDS survey. This sample is comprised of 130 faint, broad-line AGN with redshift up to z=5 and 17.5 < I< 24, and has allowed us to measure the Optical Luminosity Function up to z=3.6. We compare our results to previous literature and find that the model which best fits the combined luminosity functions is a Luminosity Dependent Density Evolution (LDDE) model, similar to the one derived from X-ray surveys. For the first time in an optical sample, we observe a \"cosmic downsizing\" phenomena, in which the AGN density peaks at lower redshift for lower luminosity objects. This supports the idea that more luminous AGN are linked to more massive black holes and peaked earlier in the Universe's evolution."}
{"text":"\nIn this research project, deep and wide-field observations of ten galaxy clusters with a range of mass, morphology, redshift, and density were made in two bands at the one meter Swope and 2.5 meter du Pont telescope at Las Campanas Observatory. Special attention was paid to the correction of illumination, subtraction from the background, point spread function determination, and subtracting galaxies. The intracluster light (ICL) flux was distinguishable in both bands for all ten clusters, with luminosities between 7.6 x 10^{10} to 7.0 x 10^{11} h^{-1} solar luminosities in r band and 1.4 x 10^{10} to 1.2 x 10^{11} h^{-1} solar luminosities in the B-band. This range of flux accounted for 6 to 22% of the total light within one quarter of the virial radius in r band, and 4 to 21% in the B-band. On average, colors in ICL ranged from 1.5 to 2.8 magnitudes after k-corrections and evolution corrections had been applied. Moreover, ICL presence was also detected in groups around the cluster center and was detected up to a distance of ~1 h^{-1} Mpc from the cluster center. The sample of the Abell clusters utilized in the study is incomplete, making it difficult to interpret correlations between the ICL flux and cluster properties. Nonetheless, a correlation between centrally distributed ICL profiles and the presence of cD galaxies was noted, suggesting that ICL may have formed either from galaxy interactions at the center or from early group formation, followed by merging in the middle."}
{"text":"\nIn this study, we present an analytical framework to look into how fluctuations in the levels of regulatory molecules can influence the concentrations of molecules in the living cell. We explore how variations in enzyme expression can affect the metabolic network, which is known to exhibit strong interdependencies. Our approach examines how linear metabolic pathways equate to a linear queueing network or mass transfer system, and reveals how the fluctuations in levels of intermediary metabolites in different metabolic patterns are largely uncorrelated. The findings suggest that adjusting enzyme levels will only affect local elements, and that metabolites can be shared among reactions without affecting the network. We test our model on a variety of metabolic networks, and discuss the implications for data gathered from metabolomics studies."}
{"text":"\nWe conducted a 10-night observational campaign to search for close-in planets in the metal-rich old open cluster NGC 6791 using the transit technique. We used the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (3.6m), the San Pedro M\\'artir telescope (2.1m), and the Loiano telescope (1.5m). We also made use of existing eight-night observational data from Bruntt et al. (2003). We achieved adequate photometric precision for the detection of planetary transits. We did not confirm the transit candidates proposed by Bruntt et al. (2003), and the probability that the null detection is simply due to chance coincidence is estimated to be 3%-10%, depending on the metallicity assumed for the cluster. Possible explanations include: a lower frequency of close-in planets in star clusters, a smaller planetary radius for planets orbiting super metal rich stars, or limitations in the assumptions. More extensive photometry with 3-4m class telescopes is necessary to draw conclusive inferences about the frequency of planets in NGC 6791."}
{"text":"This article studies the properties of very massive stars in high redshift galaxies. To explore this area, a model involving a brief episode of very massive star formation was developed. This model was used to evaluate the observed UV and Lya luminosity functions, mean and variance of the equivalent width distribution of Lya selected galaxies, EW distribution of i-drop galaxies, and the correlation of stellar age and EW. The analysis revealed that the anomalously large intrinsic EWs were related to a burst of very massive star formation lasting at most a fraction of the galaxies' total star-forming lifetimes. These findings suggest that population-III star formation may be present in a few percent of i-drop galaxies and around half of the Lya selected galaxies."}
{"text":"\nThis paper proposes a novel approach to the task of automatic resource discovery, by exploiting the user-generated annotations stored in social bookmarking sites. We develop a probabilistic model of the user annotation process in the system del.icio.us, and use it to automatically identify information sources relevant to a particular field. Experimental results demonstrate that this method provides a promising way of relieving the burden of manually discovering and integrating resources into information integration applications such as mediators and mashups."}

We explore how applying this concept of personalization to search can increase precision and find the latent topics that best capture the user's interests."}
{"text":"\nWe prove that the classic problem of computing a Nash equilibrium in a two-player game, called 'Bimatrix', is complete for the complexity class PPAD (Polynomial Parity Argument, Directed version). This breakthrough provides the first results concerning the complexity of computing Nash equilibria, and poses profound implications in mathematical economics and operations research. To illustrate, the Arrow-Debreu market equilibria is PPAD-hard to compute, while the P-Matrix Linear Complementary Problem becomes computationally harder than convex programming in PPAD. Additionally, our resolution also implies that Bimatrix has no fully polynomial-time approximation scheme and that the smoothed complexity of any algorithms for computing its Nash Equilibria is not polynomial. All of these culminates in showing that, even in the simplest form of non-cooperative games, equilibrium computation and approximation require levels of complexity equivalent to that of fixed-point computation."}
{"text":"In this article, the implications of the equation of state on the dynamics of an ideal, relativistic, magnetized fluid are explored. Mainly, the role of the commonly adopted constant $\\Gamma$-law equation of state, in comparison to a more realistic equation of state that better mirrors the single-specie relativistic gas, is studied. Additionally, a new inversion scheme to recover primitive variables from conservative ones, which takes into account a general equation of state, is presented. Furthermore, the effect of different equations of state on selected numerical tests of astrophysical relevance is examined. The findings of the research suggest that the choice of realistic equation of state may influence the solution substantially when hot and cold gas transitions are present. Moreover, a polytropic equation of state in such cases can prove to be a hazard to the solution."}

{"text":"\nThis article investigates the characteristics of transition objects (objects consisting of both an optically thin inner disc surrounded by an optically thick outer disc) and their associated disc masses (Mdisc) and stellar accretion rates (Mdot). We examine the demographic differences between accreting T Tauri stars with the same age, compared to the transition objects. We observe that transition objects possess a significantly lower Mdot at the same Mdisc, with a median Mdisc being 4 times greater than those of non-transition single stars in Taurus. These demographics may support theories of planet formation and disc accretion. An analysis of the Mdot-Mdisc plane suggests that transition objects form a distinct demographic group, which, when separated out, leads to a close relationship between Mdisc and Mdot with a slope close to the value of one anticipated in simple disc accretion theories."}
{"text":" In this paper, we present two results related to homogeneous Hessian Nilpotent polynomials. Firstly, the vanishing conjecture (VC), which states that any homogeneous HN polynomial $P(z)$ has $\\Delta^m P^{m+1}(z)=0$ for large $m$, holds for any homogeneous HN polynomial $P(z)$ provided that the projective subvarieties ${\\mathcal Z}_P$ and ${\\mathcal Z}_{\\sigma_2}$ of $\\mathbb C \nP^{n-1}$ determined by the principal ideals generated by $P(z)$ and $\\sigma_2(z):=\\sum_{i=1}^n z_i^2$, respectively, intersect only at regular points of ${\\mathcal Z}_P$. Therefore, the Jacobian conjecture is true for symmetric polynomial maps $F=z-\\nabla P$ with $P(z)$ being HN, in the absence of non-zero fixed points $w\\in \\mathbb C^n$ with $\\sum_{i=1}^n w_i^2=0$. Secondly, we prove that the VC holds for a HN formal power series $P(z)$ if and only if, for any polynomial $f(z)$, $\\Delta^m (f(z)P(z)^m)=0$ when $m>>0$."}

{"text":"In this paper, the effect of spatial dispersion on the shape of a light pulse, near to the frequency of interband transitions, in a wide quantum well is studied. The refractive index of both the quantum well and the barriers are assumed to be the same, and two excited levels close to each other are taken into consideration. The result of the calculations shows that the spatial dispersion has a significant impact on the shape of the reflected, as well as the transmitted pulses. This effect is the greatest when the radiative broadening is close to the difference in frequencies between the interband transitions."}
{"text":"\nAn analysis of nonlinear kinetic theory and observations of cosmic rays (CRs) reveals the behavior of CRs produced by supernova remnants. The magnetic field in the supernova remnants is believed to be amplified by the accelerated nuclear CR component, allowing for calculations that result in CR spectra that are consistent with existing energy measurements of up to $10^{17}$ eV. The observational components consist of a power law spectrum of protons extending up to $3\\times 10^{15}$ eV, providing gravitational evidence for the 'knee' in the Galactic CR spectrum. Additionally, the maximum energy of the accelerated nuclei is proportional to their charge number, exhibiting a break in the Galactic CR spectrum from the contribution of more massive species. Combining these components with an appropriate extragalactic CR component can enable a comprehensive description of the overall Galactic CR spectrum."}
{"text":"This paper highlights recent findings that applying elastodynamics in the context of nuclear physics and pulsar astrophysics is an effective way to characterize the macroscopic movements of degenerate Fermi-material that constitute the nuclear material. The objective is to analytically resolve, with the aid of Rayleigh's variational method, frequency and lifetime of both spheroidal and torsional modes of shear vibrations that exist in the quasistatic, force-free, non-compressional system. Results are derived through an energy balance equation. Solid globe models of nuclear and pulsar astrophysics are used to demonstrate the success of this approach, involving oscillations of a spherical mass of a viscoelastic Fermi-solid with homogeneous or non-homogeneous profiles of density, shear modulus, and shear viscosity."}
{"text":"\nThis paper provides an in-depth look at proof of the Shannon's Entropy Power Inequality (EPI). Previous information theoretic proofs to prove the EPI relied on representations of Fisher Information or Minimum Mean-Square Error (MMSE). Through this research, a unified view of these proofs is presented, showing how two essential ingredients: 1) data processing argument applied to COVARIANCE-PRESERVING LINEAR TRANSFORMATION and 2) integration over a path of a CONTINUOUS GAUSSIAN PERTURBATION are necessary. Subsequently, a new, simple and brief proof of the EPI through a mutual information inequality is developed, as an alternative to Stam and Blachman's Fisher Information Inequality and an Inequality used by Guo, Shamai and VErdu. Furthermore, these ideas are then extended to different versions of the EPI, including Zamir and Feder's Generalized EPI for linear transformations, Takano and Johnson's EPI for dependent variables, Liu and Viswanath's EPI for COVARIANCE-CONSTRAINED INEQUALITIES and Costa's concavity inequality for the Entropy Power."}
{"text":"\nA recent investigation of galaxies between 0-1.3 redshift has revealed a significant correlation between the properties of galaxies and their environment, with red galaxies found to be common in clusters while blue galaxies populate the general field. Though, not all field galaxies are young according to the study, with the most massive galaxies found to have similar ages regardless of their background. This supports the theory of galaxy formation which incorporates AGN feedback to impede star formation in massive halos. There is still some, albeit nuanced, discrepancy in findings of surveys at redshifts beyond 1.3. Interestingly, the DEEP2 and VVDS surveys discovered that the connection between color and density of galaxies was no longer present at z=1.3, the point which their respective studies began to lack complete data. At the same time, clustering studies conducted at z~2.5 concluded that red galaxies were more heavily clustered than blue galaxies, a result which suggests the color-density relation was existing since at least that redshift."}
{"text":"\nThis paper explores the features of nonabelian gauged linear sigma models by focusing on partial flag manifolds. Thus, the paper examines details of the tangent bundles, as well as other components relevant to (0,2) models. Furthermore, the construction of Calabi-Yau complete intersections within such flag manifolds is only the beginning. As far as the gauged linear sigma models themselves, special attention is paid to the examples with non-birational Kahler phases, as well as one abelian example. It is proposed that these non-birational phases are connected to Kuznetsov's homological projective duality. Lastly, the paper discusses linear sigma model moduli spaces in these same gauged linear sigma models, suggesting that Quot and hyperquot schemes are being physically modeled."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate the mid-infrared spectral composition of a set of 48 ULIRGs (Ultra-Luminous Infrared Galaxies) selected by Spitzer throughout a redshift range of z~1 to z~3. Our study attempts to quantify and understand the star formation and active galactic nucleus processes in these sources, several of which have evolved strongly over the current observed timescale. Analysis of the PAH emission lines, mid-IR continuum and extinction reveals majority of the ULIRGs are continuum-dominated (AGN-dominated). Yet around 60% of them still display PAH emission, which underscores their star-formation activity. Based on their redder mid-IR colors compared to optically-selected quasars, we estimate that ~25% of these ULIRGs are strong starburst-dominated galaxies. Moreover six of the galaxies at z~2 have 6.2um PAH equivalent widths > 0.3um along with 14um luminosities > 10^12Lsun (connected with L_IR > 10^13Lsun) which are not seen in the local Universe. After assessing the median optical depth of 9.7um, we find that these sources mirror those seen in local ULIRGs, but are one order of magnitude more luminous. The study concludes as to whether our z~2 ULIRGs are upscaled copies of their local counterparts, or subject to different physical processes."}
{"text":"In this paper, we present the latest findings of our survey exploring multiple stars that host planets. We discovered two new low-mass partners to the exoplanet hosts, HD101930A and HD65216A. HD101930A and its companion, HD101930B, are part of a wide binary system, with a separation of approximately 2,200 AU and a mass of 0.7 Msun. Additionally, HD65216 forms a triple system, with a separation of 253 AU between HD65216A and its close binary companion HD65216BC. HD65216BC has a mass of 0.089Msun and 0.078Msun respectively, putting them close to the sub-stellar limit. We also present H- and K-band ISAAC infrared spectra of HD16141B, the recently found co-moving companion to the planet host star HD16141A. Our findings point to HD16141B being a M2 to M3 dwarf located at the same distance as the planet host star."}
{"text":"\nThis study investigates the behavior of satellite galaxies created in a suite of numerical simulations of the process of galaxy formation in a universe governed by the theory of cold dark matter. We find that the velocity dispersion of the satellites is correlated to the virial velocity of the halo, which leads to substantially reduced estimates for the rotation speeds of the Milky Way and M31 galaxies compared to their disk components. Furthermore, the dark matter and the surviving satellites show similar tendencies in both their kinematics and spatial relations, while the kinematics and spatial patterns in the stellar halo are positioned apart from these populations. This suggests that the stars of the Milky Way's halo had on average more mass than the surviving little galaxies, and were brought in and broken apart much earlier than what has been retained up to this day."}
{"text":"\nThis study investigates the variations of kinematic parameters of single F and G Dwarfs in the vicinity of the Sun by examining the velocities from the Nordstrom et al. (2004) catalog. We distinguish how the vertex deviation shifts from 7+- 1 to 15+-2 degrees as the mean age diminishes from 4.3 to 1.5 Gyr. Our analyses of the two-dimensional velocity distributions in the UV, UW and VW planes possibly trace the evolution of the major peaks in velocity distributions up to a mean age of 9 Gyr. Our key discoveries are the stars with varying types congregating in the distinct stable peaks of the Hyades, Pleiades, and Sirius clusters; the domination of the Hyades peak in all age intervals and the prominence of the peak at an average age of 1.5 Gyr as well as a break of kinematic parameters near 4.5 Gyr. We deduce the solar LSR velocity to be V_{\\odot LSR} = (8.7, 6.2, 7.2)+- (0.5, 2.2, 0.8) km\/s through the Stromberg relation."}
{"text":"\nWe analyze the trajectories of satellite galaxies in a suite of N-body\/gas dynamical simulations of $L_*$ galaxies in a LCDM environment. While the majority of satellites follow standard orbits, 1\/3 of those discovered at z = 0 follow such non-conventional courses with apocenters more distant than the turnaround radii. We hypothesize that the 'cosmic m\u00e9nage-\u00e0-trois' effect, with a satellite flying away on an extremely high energy orbit after the initial close encounter with its host, is the source of these distant and fast-transiting members of the Local Group, such as Andromeda XIV, Leo I, and the strictly isolated spheroidals Cetus and Tucana. Therefore, caution must be taken when interpreting the orbits of the most feeble satellites in order to constrain the full Local Group mass."}
{"text":"\nThis article presents findings from a study of the magnetic and axial-vector transitions of the baryon antidecuplet using the chiral quark-soliton model. The calculated parameters were obtained from the experimental data for the baryon octet's magnetic moments, hyperon semileptonic decay constants, and singlet axial-vector constant. Results indicate that transition magnetic moments $\\mu_{\\Lambda\\Sigma}$ and $\\mu_{N\\Delta}$ are accurately reproduced and other octet-decuplet and octet-antidecuplet transitions are predicted. Additionally, the calculated $\\mu_{\\Sigma\\Sigma^*}$ falls below the limit imposed by the SELEX collaboration. The precise results explain new observations by the GRAAL and Tohoku LNS group. Furthermore, the transition axial-vector constants for the $\\Theta^+\\to KN$ and its associated decay width as a function of the pion-nucleon sigma term $\\Sigma_{\\pi N}$ are determined. The study also investigates how varying the $g_{A}^{(0)}$ affects the decay width, concluding that a small decay width is possible with generally accepted $g_{A}^{(0)}$."}
{"text":"\nThe Hamburg Quasar Survey (HQS) recently discovered a hot and young pre-cataclysmic variable, HS1857+5144, an binary system composed of a white dwarf and a M dwarf. To determine its properties, time-resolved optical spectroscopy and photometry were conducted which revealed a sinusoidal variation with a period of 383.52 minutes and peak-to-peak amplitudes of 0.7 mag in the B-band and 1.1 mag in the R-band. These large amplitudes are due to a reflection effect in the heated inner hemisphere of the companion star. The radial velocity study performed on the white dwarf implies that the photometric period can be attributed to the orbital period of the system. By fitting a model atmosphere to its spectrum, the mass and temperature of the white dwarf was estimated to be MwD=~0.6-1.0 Msun and Twd=~70000-100000 K respectively. Additionally, Msec=~0.15-0.30 Msun and i=~45-55 degrees were assessed for the companion star and the binary inclination respectively. This places HS1857+5144 as one of the youngest pre-CV known to date and suggests that the present system emerged from a common envelope phase 10^5 yr ago, ready to start mass transfer within or below the 2-3h period gap."}
{"text":"\nIn this article, we develop a formal model for unicast and multicast routing of Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. To accomplish our goal, we first translate the network into a weighted graph or and-or graph, depending on whether it is a unicast or multicast. The weights of the connectors represent the multi-dimensional costs associated with each network link in terms of QoS metrics such as bandwidth, cost, and packet loss. We represent this graph using Soft Constraint Logic Programming (SCLP) and use the built-in engine to find the best paths\/trees by optimizing their associated costs and fulfilling the imposed constraints. Additionally, we make use of c-semiring structures, enabling us to model the QoS metrics accurately. Finally, we provide an implementation for scale-free networks  and offer suggestions for improving performance."}
{"text":"\nExamining the Lorentz transformations from the new perspective of space and time as one coordinate, we analyze the prerequisites for time dilation and length contraction. We measure the overlapping of perceived simultaneity between observers. We trace this cause back to a finitephase velocity produced in a moving frame. With reference to the de Broglie wavelengths generated by a particle in motion, we see that the wave phase is a relativistic invariant, with equal perception to all viewers. The same holds true for electromagnetic waves transporting energy at the speed of light. This suggests that the universe and matter exist as visible wave forms, with a wave phase that is consistent to all observers. This wave phase can be used in lieu of time as a universal reference."}
{"text":"This paper presents a thorough examination into the mapping of time-dependent densities onto potentials in quantum mechanics. Runge and Gross (Phys. Rev. Lett. 52, 997 (1984)) initially established the singularity of this mapping, laying down a theoretical foundation for time-dependent density functional theory. Further exploration of this topic extends past the matter of existence and uniqueness, as stability and chaos are now proposed as key elements as well. In the particular case of a two-level system, examples of harmless, stable densities were found which cannot be formed from any respective potentials. These instances constitute non-existence. In addition, Lyapunov analysis verified chaos to be present in the mapping process. Even more notably, real-space analysis supports the establishment of v-representability, yet most mappings are chaotic, leading to a greatly increased difficulty to create the necessary potentials. The chaotic nature of the mapping makes previously promising application of TDDFT in real-time settings far less practical."}

Through an evaluation of structure functions and the Georgi-Manohar chiral quark model, the orbital structure of the nucleon can be defined for quark, antiquark and gluon constituents. The Collins functions and Boer-Mulders functions are explored in this evaluation, along with additional assumptions on the gluon orbital structure function, as a way of better understanding the quantum structures within the nucleon."}
{"text":"\nRecent evidence of intrinsic ripples in freely hanging graphene has refocused theoretical attention on the stability of two-dimensional (2D) layers and membranes. In this article, the authors make use of atomistic Monte Carlo simulations based on an accurate carbon-based interatomic potential to investigate the source of these height fluctuations. They show that ripples spontaneously appear due to thermal fluctuations with a size distribution relevant to experimental findings (50-100 \\AA). This surprising discovery provides evidence of a novel mechanism for stability in 2D membrane systems, facilitated by the multiplicity of chemical bonding in carbon."}
{"text":"This article provides an authoritative explanation of the shear-thinning phenomenon affecting the film thickness and traction in EHL contacts, confirming the ordinary power-law rule that has been proposed by many theoretical models such as the Carreau model. Through precise measurements in viscometers and in contact, it was possible to predict the central film thickness and traction from the rheological properties of a PAO with a low critical stress for shear-thinning. These data can be useful for creating an accurate simulation of Hertz zone behavior. Furthermore, a new model has been proposed that can be used to characterize mixtures."}
{"text":"This article presents an overview of the current research in superlubricity under mixed lubrication and EHD regimes. It summarizes the pioneering works of scientist such as Martin, Hirano, and Dienwiebel and further confirms their results. It also highlights the development of carbon-based coatings and materials being used in industrial applications. The article goes on to explain that while friction coefficients between 3-10% have been achieved in lubricant-based regimes, the gains from superlubricity in the meso- and macro-scales are expected to be somewhat limited. It wraps up with an analysis of fewer articles on lubricated superlubricity in recent literature, and offers a possible explanation."}
{"text":"This article reviews the current state of the phenomenology of massive neutrinos. We examine the phenomenon of neutrino oscillation in both vacuum and in matter, and then present the leptonic parameters derived from the three-neutrino oscillation interpretation of the data obtained from the solar, atmospheric, reactor and accelerator neutrino beams. The article further explores the potential role of new physics in inducing leptonic flavor transitions in both matter and vacuum, and examines the implications of the LSND observations. The article also outlines the aims and possibilities of future neutrino experiments and facilities in furthering our understanding of these topics, and has also presented the updated results of MiniBooNE on the status of extended models."}
{"text":"\nThis article examines the use of the lowest order constrained variational method to determine the equation of state of atomic systems with non-zero angular momentum l for large scattering length a_s of the interparticle interactions. Here, when the spacing between particles r_o is much larger than the range of the potential, parameters such as the energy per particle depend only on the parameter r_o and the free Fermi gas energy E_{FG}. For Bose gases with large scattering lengths, this yields simple equations for the energy per particle in terms of a l-specific length scale \\xi_l that incorporates not only the potential range but also the average particle spacing. We discuss implications of these results for two-component fermionic systems with finite l and provide a calculation of the equation of state of both liquid and gaseous bosonic helium."}
{"text":"\nThis paper explores various techniques of Bayesian model selection for determining the statistical attributes of gravitational waves detected by the \\emph{Laser Interferometer Space Antenna} (LISA). Specifically, the paper examines techniques to evaluate the number of sources and their appropriate description against the number of parameters required to form a waveform model. To do this, Bayes factors are calculated between competing models, such as the Reverse Jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) algorithm, Savage-Dickie density ratios, the Schwarz-Bayes Information Criterion (BIC), and the Laplace approximation to the model evidence. With these tests, the article is able to assess the degree to which low-mass binary systems possess measurable frequency evolution, thus providing better insight into the characteristics of gravitational waves."}
{"text":"\nA cascade model is developed for particle concentration and enstrophy in fully developed turbulence with mass loading feedback, assessed using 3D direct numerical simulations. The governing Eulerian equations are solved using pseudo-spectral methods on up to 512**3 grid points, and the resultant multiplier distributions, which present a measure of intermittency, decrease with increasing mass loading within the local region where the multipliers are measured. A partition correlation probability is proposed to account for the spatial anticorrelation between particle concentration and enstrophy, and joint probability distribution functions of concentration and enstrophy produced by the cascade model are found to correlate closely with those determined directly from the simulations. Probabilities are also predicted at Reynolds numbers well beyond direct simulation capability, indicating that particle mass loading decreases the probability of high concentrations and enstrophy relative to unloaded runs. It is concluded that this model may enable significant computational savings in certain applications, and suggests a particle mass density threshold of around 100 times the gas density."}
{"text":"\nThis article unifies the dynamics of networks and of molecular evolution through a single-parameter model. This model combines the preferential attachment network growth process with the quasispecies equation (a model for molecular evolution) and the Erdos-Renyi random graph model. We discuss the resulting implications for both evolutionary and network dynamics and show how mathematical tools from one realm can be applied to the other. We determine and simulate the form of the degree distribution of the unified model and show that it also models aspects of network growth. Our work provides a bridge for connecting two seemingly disparate spheres of study and allows for new insights into the complexities of growth dynamics in networks."}
{"text":"\nThis survey of 78 VLM binary systems has uncovered 21 binary systems, 13 of which are new discoveries. The new binaries have separations ranging from 0.18 arcsec to 1.3 arcsec after correcting for distance. The resulting binary fraction is 13.5%, which is in agreement with prior work. Notably, 9 of these newly discovered binaries have orbital radii > 10 AU, including one system that has a projected 27 AU separation. Furthermore, the orbital radius distribution of binaries with V-K < 6.5 appears to differ from that of lower-mass systems, suggesting a dramatic change at the M5 spectral type. Finally, there was no correlation found between X-ray emission and the frequency and parameters of the VLM systems."}
{"text":"\nWe demonstrate that, in the framework of inflationary cosmology, some non-eternal inflation models that satisfy the null energy condition can yield an increase in de Sitter horizon area of at least one Planck unit with each inflationary e-folding. This provides a tangible meaning to the finitude of the de Sitter entropy S_dS of an inflationary de Sitter space coming to a close in an asymptotically flat region: an asymptotic observer can never detect more than e^(S_dS) independent inflationary modes. This establishes limits on the quantity of de Sitter space lying beyond the horizon that can be validated semantically in quantum gravity, much like the breakdown of locality in black hole evaporation. Contrastingly, the limitation does not stand for inflationary models that break the null energy condition, e.g. ghost inflation, for which black hole thermodynamics also fails. This finding strengthens the argument in favor of a thermodynamical interpretation of the boundary which also makes it clear that these theories may not follow fundamental principles of gravitation."}
{"text":"\nThis paper presents the findings of simultaneous damped Lyman alpha (DLA) and\nsub-DLA absorption towards the z~3 binary quasar SDSS 1116+4118 AB. With a\nseparation of approximately 110 kpc, a speculated group of two or more galaxies\nwas concluded to be the source of the common absorption detected in both lines\nof sight. We derive metal column densities from a high resolution Keck ESI\nspectrum of the two quasars for five absorbers and detect high levels of metal\nenrichment for the DLA at both z=2.66 and z=2.94. The ratio of alpha-to-Fe peak\nelements from [S\/Zn] was measured to be approximately solar for the DLA and an\nupper limit for the molecular fraction of log f(H_2)< -5.5 was determined. Our\nresults indicate the potential for high levels of metal enrichment in galaxies\nat z ~ 3, as well as the need to consider line of sight DLA blending when\ndetermining abundances."}
{"text":"In this article, we investigate the disparity between the number of observed satellites in the Milky Way and its predicted CDM mass function. We explore the maximum circular velocities (Vmax) of the Milky Way's luminous satellites and construct mass models in order to derive the likelihoods of their masses within 0.6 kpc (M_0.6). We then compare the flat M_0.6 mass function of luminous satellites to the steeply rising CDM subhalos mass function. After ruling out the hypothesis that the 11 well-known satellites are hosted by the 11 most massive subhalos, we show that models which account for the earliest-forming or most massive accreted objects better fit the observed mass function. We conclude that further analysis of newly-discovered dwarf satellites may provide additional powerful constraints on the CDM small-scale power spectrum and warm dark matter models."}
{"text":"\nWe consider a type of graphical codes based on combining a low-density generator matrix (LDGM) code with a low-density parity check (LDPC) code. Through theorems, we show that there are codes with a finite degree construction in this class that can achieve the best results in terms of rate-distortion and capacity-noise. Further, we reveal the nested structure allowing us to achieve the Wyner-Ziv bound for source coding and the Gelfand-Pinsker bound for channel coding with side information. Besides optimal performance, the proposed graphical codes have benefits of sparse structure, high girth, and message-passing for efficient decoding. Therefore, these codes are optimal for source and channel coding, as well as binning."}
{"text":"This article presents observational evidence for the presence of extended envelopes around Cepheids from near-infrared interferometric spectroscopy, utilizing the CHARA\/FLUOR instrument. We observed Y Oph and alpha Per in order to measure the center-to-limb darkening (CLD) and possible circumstellar envelopes (CSE) and determine accurate distances. Our results suggest that Y Oph is surrounded by a CSE with similar characteristics as those previously observed around other Cepheids; however, data on alpha Per did not support the presence of a CSE. After reviewing the results of four Cepheids, we find that all evidence suggests that most of these stars possess faint CSEs and pulsations might be the driving force behind their mass loss. This research helps to improve the accuracy of the interferometric Baade-Wesselink method and provides reliable distances when measuring Cepheids."}
{"text":"\nThis article examines the hadroproduction and decays of the squark and gaugino particles in supersymmetry theories where there is non-minimal flavour violation. To quantify the misalignment of quark and squark rotations, the authors use the super-CKM basis. Furthermore, this work looks at generalized (possibly complex) charges to determine the interactions between (s)quarks, gauge bosons and gauginos. The cross sections for a variety of squark-(anti-)squark\/gaugino pair and squark-gaugino associated production processes have been given in analytical form. Additionally, four different constrained forms of supersymmetry breaking models with non-minimal flavour violation have been used to set up the parameter space, and this space is in agreement with low-energy, electroweak precision and cosmological constraints. The chirality and flavour decomposition of all up- and down-type squark mass eigenstates is presented. Lastly, numerical examples have been included to depict the production cross sections at the LHC, based on the experimentally allowed\/favoured ranges of off-diagonal mass matrix elements."}
{"text":"\nWe present new near and mid-IR photometry of the Pleiades star cluster to identify possible new very low mass and substellar mass members. We extend two magnitudes deeper than the 2MASS All-Sky Point Source catalog and identify a total of 42 new candidate members that are fainter than Ks=14 (or 0.1 solar masses). This sample should allow us to better estimate the Pleiades cluster's mass function down to 0.04 solar masses. We also use IRAC data, in particular 8 um images, to discuss interstellar dust related to the Pleiades. We find that a sample of low mass stars recently identified with debris disks do not have significant excesses at IRAC wavelengths, except for one exception. Furthermore, evidence shows that several of the cluster's high mass stars are impacting nearby molecular clouds."}
{"text":" In this study, we focus on the charge order in half-doped manganites and explore how the doped holes form additional effective $e_g$ orbitals at the low-energy scale. Our Wannier states analysis reveals that the electrons are highly itinerant, significantly delocalizing the Mn$^{3+}$ Wannier states and leading to a leaking of charge into the Mn$^{4+}$ sites. Furthermore, the derivation of the low-energy effective Hamiltonian enables us to specify the roles of electron-electron and electron-lattice interactions in driving the charge order. All of this suggests that the Mn$^{3+}$\/Mn$^{4+}$ valence picture is still applicable and reconciles discrepancies between experimental observations and traditional models."}
{"text":"This article examines the unfairness occurring when IEEE 802.11e Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA) is used within infrastructure Basic Service Set (BSS) of Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs). We present an analytical model to calculate EDCA parameters that ensure balanced resource allocation to both uplink and downlink flows, as well as a dynamic EDCA parameter adaptation algorithm that deals with the differences between User Datagram Protocol (UDP) and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) interactions at the transport and Medium Access Control (MAC) layers. We demonstrate how adjusting the Contention Window (CW) and Transmit Opportunity (TXOP) limit at the Access Point allows for fair access between uplink and downlink of the same Access Category (AC) while maintaining relative prioritization among ACs."}
{"text":"This paper investigates the limit of in-degree distributions in growing networks when out-degree probabilities are arbitrary. We discover that if out-degree probabilities have a light tail (finite variance), then corresponding in-degree distributions follow a $k^{-3}$ behavior. Conversely, when out-degree probabilities display a scale-invariant tail ($k^{-\\alpha}$) then in-degree ones follow the same trend only when $2<\\alpha<3$ (infinite variance). We also present the descriptive statistics of in-degree and out-degree in the WWW network and provide an application to the scientific publications network. By exploring the relationships between in-degree and out-degree distributions, this paper can shed insights into the generally observed tail behaviors of in\/out-degree distributions in real networks."}
{"text":"\nThe research team calculated the shock and release temperatures existing in molybdenum (Mo) taking into account the plastic flow that was projected using the Steinberg-Guinan approach. It was necessary to integrate this information with the conditions of the shock jump to determine an accurate estimate of possible shock states accessible. The resulting temperatures were greater than what was anticipated using the ideal hydrodynamic loading premise. The temperatures were then tested against measurements gotten from surface emission spectrometry for Mo discharged at 60GPa and then released into a vacuum and LiF window. The shock loading process was triggered by a planar projectile accelerated via a high powered explosive or in a gun. Surface velocimetry revealed an elastic wave at the beginning of the discharge from the shocked state, and the wave\u2019s amplitude was approximately that of the predictions it was likely that the pressure in the shocked state was roughly sound. The measurements were in line with the simulations, implying that the percentage of plastic work turning into heat was around 70-100% for these loading conditions."}
{"text":"\nThe order of the 2D polymer escape transition was investigated through simulation of self-avoiding walks along a square lattice with the pruned-enriched-Rosenbluth method (PERM) and theoretical analysis based on a Landau free energy approach. Results from PERM simulations revealed a small but finite jump in the average characteristics including the order parameter, indicating a weak first-order phase transition in the thermodynamic limit of large N and L but finite L\/N. The theoretical description was found to be in good agreement with the simulation results. These findings provide better understanding of the abrupt transition of an end-grafted flexible polymer chain in 3D space and its 2D counterpart."}
{"text":"\nThis study investigates how galaxy mergers could shape the well-known linear correlation between supermassive black hole (BH) mass (MBH) and their host galaxies' stellar bulge masses (Mbulge). It reveals that a linear MBH-Mgal relationship could emerge whatever the original seeding of BHs in galaxies due to two statistical effects: the propensity of major galaxy mergers towards a central limit, and the converging tendency of minor mergers towards a linear relationship. Furthermore, it suggests that merging statistics make more strongly correlated MBHs to bulge-dominated galaxies than to disk-dominated galaxies. Ultimately, this thought experiment shows how random merging of pre-existing, possibly non-linearly correlated mutually-influencing objects can generate a tight linear correlation, which could be generalized to other gravitationally-bound objects like dark matter halos and compact nuclear objects."}
{"text":"This paper investigates the Cauchy problem for the Klein-Gordon equation featuring cubic convolution nonlinearity in $\\R^3$. By using a combination of Bourgain's method and a Strichartz estimate from Klainerman and Tataru, we show the global, $H^s (s<1)$ well-posedness of the Cauchy problem for the cubic convolution-based Klein-Gordon-Hartree equation. Additionally, we provide a novel global solution for this non-scaling equation with small initial data in $H^{s_0}\\times H^{s_0-1}$ where $s_0=\\frac\\gamma 6$ but not $\\frac\\gamma2-1$. To arrive at the aforementioned conclusion, we utilize Bony's decomposition, flexibility of Klein-Gordon admissible pairs which diverges from the wave equation, and a specific commutator estimate arising from the cancellation property together with the Coifman and Meyer multilinear multiplier theorem. This appears to be the first result linking low regularity to this Klein-Gordon-Hartree equation."}
{"text":" Orbital-free density functional theory (DFT) is a method of computing the energy of the electronic ground state without using orbital wave functions. In this paper, we explore the use of kinetic potentials, which is the functional derivative of the kinetic energy DF, as well as ab-initio local pseudopotentials which reduce errors from the kinetic potentials, as a means to more accurately calculate nonlocal approximations for the kinetic energy. We also propose two nonlocal orbital free kinetic potentials and show that these yield excellent results for total energies, ionization energies, and shell structures in atomic radial density."}
{"text":"\nThis study examines the effects of a parameter quench on a extended quantum system and its correlation functions. We demonstrate that, by taking advantage of boundary critical phenomena in one higher dimension, correlation functions in d dimensions can be studied. For d=1, this offers the opportunity to employ the powerful tools of conformal field theory in cases of critical evolution. Results of the mean-field approximation are obtained in generic dimension and tested over real-time evolutions of solvable models, with the aim of understanding which elements are valid beyond the critical domain.\n\nOur results are explained by a general trend, whereby quasiparticles, entangled throughout an area of a few correlation lengths in the initial state, spread at a finite speed through the system. Additionally, long-term effects are interpreted by a generalized Gibbs ensemble. We conclude this paper by bringing up several ideas for potential further improvements."}
{"text":"\n\nThe effects of introducing choice into tree and network growth models are studied in this paper. At each step, the newly introduced node connects to one of its k randomly chosen contacts, chosen based on some criterion, such as distance to the root or degree. We find that even when k=2, the resulting network has notable differences from a regular random graph or tree. For instance, if the new node attaches to the nearest contact to the root, we observe an alteration of the depths distribution from Poisson to a traveling wave solution. Additionally, when the node attaches to the contact with the smallest degree, we observe the degree distribution is closer to uniform than in a random graph, and when the node attaches to the largest degree, the degree distribution is a power law with exponent -1 up until k degrees, followed by an exponential cutoff. Consequently, large k values are necessary to observe a power law over a wide degree range."}
{"text":"\nAn investigation into the ability of evolution to facilitate the development of properties like mutational robustness or evolvability, i.e. those that do not directly benefit any single individual but may influence how future evolution occurs, provided the basis of this work. Laboratory experiments were performed to discern whether mutational robustness is favored when populations are large enough, with the results showing a correlation between population size and their propensity for greater mutational robustness. Additional characteristics such as protein stability also increased in larger populations and could be connected to mathematical theories which describe the way proteins interact with their neutral networks. This is the first experiment to show that, in large and polymorphic populations, evolution is more likely to favor mutational robustness and protein stability. It is suggested that this may apply to viruses and bacteria which are known to have large populations."}
{"text":"This paper proposes a model for understanding the origin of the two plateaus in the temperature-doping dependence of high-Tc cuprate YBa2Cu3O6+x. The model is based on the concept of critical chain length and described in terms of two-dimensional asymmetric next-to-nearest-neighbor Ising model. It has been found that for any temperature below the top of the OII phase, there exists a uniquely defined critical chain length lcr(T), which yields a constant doping p(x)=const (corresponding to the 60K plateau of Tc(x)) in the regime of OII phase, and following a monotonously increasing p(x) over optimal doping level p=0.16 in the regime of OI phase (90K plateau). A part of the holes in the long chains can capture electrons, leading to two plateaus-like behavior of Tc(x) in YBa2Cu3O6+x."}
{"text":"An analytical investigation is presented to study the normal-incidence transmission and dispersion properties of optical multilayers as well as one-dimensional stepwise potential barriers in the non-tunneling regime. Applying a generalized quarter-wave condition, the parameters of each layer in the multilayer structure, along with those of each step in the potential barrier, can be constrained without limiting the structure's geometry. As a result, the density of states (DOS) spectra of the multilayer or barrier in question are subject to integral conservation rules similar to the Barnett-Loudon sum rule. These conservation rules, which can take the form of both periodic and non-periodic frequency or energy intervals, are numerically verified and can be used to engineer multilayer-based devices and multiple-quantum-well electronic heterostructures."}
{"text":"\nThe elusive nature of the progenitors of long duration gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) has been an intriguing mystery for some time. Much of the current thinking suggests that these blasts originate from the core collapse of massive stars in type Ic supernovae, but the details of their formation, initial masses and pathways remain unknown. Experts believe that, in order for LGRBs to be produced, rapid rotation and the formation of a black hole are both necessary. Therefore, this paper proposes that progenitors of this type of gamma-ray burst could be composed of very massive stars (>20 solar masses) within tight binary systems. Through the use of simple models, this hypothesis is compared to observations and it appears that the GRB locations on their host galaxies are indicative of main-sequence masses that surpass 20 solar masses, while up to 50% of binary systems were thought to have close enough proximity to have the appropriate velocity for GRB production. Consequently, massive stars in binary systems are believed to be a primary publisher of at least a portion of LGRBs."}
{"text":"\nA recent study explored the optimal parameters for the successful growth of millimeter-thick single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) forests using C2H4\/ H2\/ H2O\/ Ar reactant gas and a Fe\/ Al2O3 catalyst. Results from this study determined that SWNTs grow best with a thin layer of Fe catalyst when the catalyst is supported on Al2O3, pointing to Al2O3 support as a means to boost the activity of Fe, Co, and Ni catalysts. However, the parameters to achieve a rapid growth rate of SWNTs were found to be narrow. Increasing the amount of added H2O can increase the SWNT growth rate, but its quality suffers when increased beyond optimal amounts. Similarly, H2 is essential for rapid growth, but its addition has the same negative effects as H2O once an optimal threshold is exceeded. Al2O3 was speculated to boost the SWNT growth rate by providing the carbon source for the catalyst nanoparticles. Additionally, the mechanisms responsible for the narrow growth window for SWNTs were addressed."}
{"text":"\nWe explore the role of electron correlation effects on the band structure of oxide systems, namely MgO, through applying ab initio wavefunction based methods. Our approach consists of a local Hamiltonian approach and is performed on finite fragments cut from the infinite solid. Through using localized Wannier functions and embedding potentials obtained from prior periodic Hartree-Fock (HF) calculations, we calculate on-site, nearest-neighbor charge relaxation, and long-range polarization effects in order to examine their impact on diminishing the HF band gap and modifying the band widths. We find that correlation effects are essential for obtaining accurate band gap data, but make less of an impact on HF band widths. Intriguingly, we observe a broadening effect for O 2p valence bands. Our data align with energy gap and band width measurements through thermoreflectance and x-ray photoemission experiments, implying wavefunction based methods are capable of accurately approximating the electronic band structure while identifying its determining processes."}
{"text":"\nThe aim of this study was to investigate the presence of C, N and O variations in a sample of seven intermediate-mass (4-6 Msun) AGB stars in the LMC and SMC by analysing high-dispersion near-infrared spectra. To this end, models of stellar pulsation have been created to determine the stellar masses and spectral synthesis calculations have been carried out to determine abundances. For two stars, it was possible to derive abundances of C, N, O, Na, Al, Ti, Sc and Fe and the results confirmed the expected production of primary nitrogen via a combination of third dredge-up and hot-bottom burning. The remaining sample of five could not be studied as either their atmosphere temperatures were too cool or strong shocks in their atmospheres filled line core emission, making determination of the abundances impossible. This suggests the pulsation phases during which observations should be made for successful chemical abundance analysis."}
{"text":"\nThe Kepler satellite, with its unprecedented photometric precision, provides a valuable opportunity to spot low-amplitude stellar light variability caused by a variety of physical processes, one of which is the tidal force due to substellar planetary companions. In this article, a detailed examination is conducted concerning the periodic flux modulations brought about by this force. An analytic equation is derived using the equilibrium-tide approximation and is found to hold true for stars with a mass of less than 1.4 solar masses. However, a more extensive oscillatory response is seen in stars that are more massive, with their largely radiative envelopes giving rise to flux variations that can be up to 10 times larger than naive estimates. Analytical and numerical solutions to the linear, nonadiabatic stellar oscillation equations are also utilized to examine oscillatory responses in the convective zone. Taking into account the time-dependent nature of these oscillations, we posit that such ellipsoidal modulations induced by giant planets may be detectable in up to 100 out of the 10^5 target stars for the Kepler mission."}
{"text":"In this paper we explore the ability of molecular motors to induce internal forces within a microtubule lattice, producing exciting deformations such as S and V shapes. By comparing our theory to experimental results, we are able to determine the shear to stretch moduli ratio of the microtubule, as well as estimate the forces generated in the lattice when motors such as katanin bind. We analyze the effect motors have on multiple microtubules, which could lead to the formation of axonemes. Our findings suggest that motors have great potential to move or 'animate' microtubules from within their lattice, negating the need for interaction with other structures."}
{"text":"  This article tackles the calculation of the effective one loop Lagrangian with respect to $\\chi^{+}_j \\chi^{-}_kH^{0}_l$ interactions in the minimal supersymmetric standard model, extending previous analyses of the supersymmetric loop correction to the neutral Higgs couplings. The actual computation of the Lagrangian is then applied to neutral Higgs decays, to which the loop corrections result in significant size changes, reaching up to 40% variations in the branching ratio. The sensitivity of the branching ratio to CP phases is also examined."}
{"text":"\nThe impacts of thermal inertia on the magnitude of the Yarkovsky effect are assessed in this article. This phenomenon causes the slow alteration of orbits for km-sized asteroids and is responsible for bringing Near-Earth Asteroids (NEAs) in from the main belt as well as for the boundaries of asteroid families. This study revealed the average thermal inertia of a sample of NEAs in the km-range to be 200 $\\pm$ 40 J m&#8722;2 s&#8722;0.5 K&#8722;1. Additionally, there was an identified correlation between increasing thermal inertia and lesser asteroid diameters, suggesting that the drift rate of orbital semimajor axis is more complicated than a putative D^(&#8722;1) dependence. This knowledge could explain why the size distribution of NEAs and main-belt asteroids is not direclty comparable."}
{"text":"\nIn this study, we investigate the compatibility and consistency between photometric  surveys and radial velocimetry data sets in terms of exoplanet population simulation.The OGLE field is used to simulate a star population and assign them extrasolar companions. Models of planet evolution and structure with varying fractions of heavy elements are utilized. We assess the compatibility of the output list of detectable planets from the simulations with the real detections, and determine whether planets with periods between 1 and 2 days are fewer than those with orbits between 2 and 5 days. Additionally, trends of relative absence of giant planets with low mass and small orbital distances are also established. Additionally, it is inferred that metal-rich stars with [Fe\/H] >-0.07 are likely to have short period planets."}
{"text":"\nThis article explores whether the rapid and highly coherent oscillations observed in some cataclysmic variables, such as SS Cygni, are related to global disk oscillation modes. In order to do this, the formalism developed for the study of black hole accretion disks is being applied to the Newtonian case. The proposed model aims to discover the possible physical explanations of the similarities between the oscillation phenomenology of cataclysmic variables and X-ray binaries. Additionally, it could be used to determine the angular momentum parameter of the black holes."}
{"text":"\nThis work examines a novel approach for deriving blind Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) based symbol estimation and carrier-frequency offsets (CFO) from the received base-band signal, in distributed antenna systems, by exploiting over-sampling of the signal. The technique results in identification of the variously offset user symbols, and consequential signal decoupling for each of them. Furthermore, exploiting the information from the estimated MIMO system response, an accompanying decision feedback Phase Lock Loop (PLL) is applied, which helps in faster convergence and resolution of ambiguities, enabling accurate symbol recovery."}
{"text":"This article investigates the general relativistic corrections to the second-order perturbations of cosmological fluids. We demonstrate that the equations of motion of density and velocity perturbations in a zero-pressure, multi-component, irrotational and flat background exhibit the same results obtained in Newton's theory. Further, we demonstrate that pure relativistic correction terms appear in the equations of motion in the presence of pressure, background curvature, and rotation. In particular, when the scale is small we find that the relativistic corrections including the rotation coincide with those obtained in Newton's gravity."}
{"text":"\nWe examine the Lagrangian-Averaged Navier-Stokes alpha-model (LANS) at considerably higher Reynolds numbers compared to previous studies, allowing sufficient separation of scales to observe two distinct inertial ranges. Analyses of the third-order structure function scaling and of the resulting energy spectrum show the presence of a l^3 (E(k) k^-1) scaling, which is subdominant to k^1, but is fundamental to driving a direct energy cascade. We discuss a method to reach grid-independent LANS solutions or to obtain a formulation of a large-eddy simulation (LES) as applicable to the alpha models. We also observe that the small-scale behavior of LANS can reduce flux at constant energy, leading to a less steep energy spectrum for high alpha values, though it does not affect the intermittency properties of high Re flows."}
{"text":"\nWe carry out a set of two-dimensional magnetorotational core-collapse simulations of Population III stars. Varying the distributions of rotation and magnetic fields before collapse in a parametric manner, 19 models are produced. This way we analyze in detail the influence of rotation and magnetic fields on the dynamics of the collapse and the consequences on the formation of black holes and emitted neutrinos. We employ a realistic equation of state and a multiflavour leakage scheme for the neutrino transfer. Our results indicate that jet-like explosions can be generated by magnetodriven shock waves if the initial magnetic field is as high as $10^{12}$ G. Additionally, the masses of black holes formed are lower when the initial field strength increases, but higher when the initial rotation rates are higher. Regarding neutrino properties, the degree of differential rotation is a determining factor in the dominance of one species of neutrino luminosity over others. Moreover, the peak neutrino luminosities diminish with stronger magnetic fields, because the magnetic pressure works to impede the collapse in the inner regions, thus reducing the releasable gravitational binding energy."}
{"text":"\nIn this article we examine the weak condition of rime instead of the standard Ansatz when studying matrix solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation. We identify the different types of solutions under rime, including the Drinfeld-Jimbo R-matrix, Cremmer-Gervais R-matrix, and R-matrices associated with GL(1|1)-type. We link these rime solutions to the Bezout operators and look into the structure of the elementary rime blocks. Additionally, we classify the various possible rime Poisson brackets and associative algebras of orderable quadratic rime, and consider the case of the Drinfeld-Jimbo solution that can be rimed when chosen multiparameters are selected."}
{"text":"This work investigates how dynamics increases the vulnerability of networks to cascading failures. Using a conservation and distribution model based on flow, it is established that the dynamic factor has a negative impact on the robustness of the network relative to static overload models. By providing upper and lower network robustness thresholds, an interplay between the network topology, flow dynamics, and the ratio $\\chi$ of time scales $\\tau$ and $\\tau_0$ is recognized as determining the full extent of vulnerabilities to cascading failures."}
{"text":"\nWe are attempting to investigate the connection between the luminosity of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and the size of their broad line regions by extrapolating the existing relationship (R=a L^g) to higher redshifts and luminosities. This extrapolation allows us to identify the central black hole mass using a single-epoch measurement, which is important for future cosmological studies. Our 1.8m telescope, with its capability to observe quasars with V<15.7, is allowing us to monitor and measure the relative variability of continuum and emission lines in two bright, intermediate redshift quasars, PG1634+706 and PG1247+268. After 3.2 years, we have found that the continuum varies significantly in the latter quasar, which has a luminosity >10^47erg\/s, while no continuum variability was detected in the former. This observation encourages the continuation of the campaign, with the aims of further assessing the variability of both quasars, and eventually determining the black hole mass for them. Our work should provide a fuller understanding of the M_BH-L relation and its extrapolation to higher luminosities and redshifts."}
{"text":"\nThis article addresses the consequences of photon-spin-zero particle interactions in external magnetic fields in relation to the polarization of light. Our investigations are not limited to pseudo-scalar or scalar particles, allowing us to look beyond the traditional QCD axion. We examine the evolution of this system within the parameters of field theory and calculate the polarization alterations and transition chances for two different scenarios: one-way propagation, relevant to astrophysical sources of spin-zero particles, and round-trip propagation, which is applicable to laboratory optical experiments such as the PVLAS. Results reveal the possibility for special configurations of polarization for one-way propagation where transition occurs but polarization does not shift, or for round-trip propagation where polarization alterations take place but the intensity is modified by a factor depending on the relative strength of the two interactions."}
{"text":"\nThis paper introduces multi-wavelength optical and infrared photometry of 170 low mass stars and brown dwarfs in the 5-million-year-old Collinder 69 (Lambda Orionis) cluster. Most of our new photometric data support the cluster membership of these previously known stars, with the minority identified as probable non-members. We demonstrate the presence of a significant population of stars exhibiting IR excesses and classify them as Class II members. The number of Class II members ranges from 25% for stars in the M0-M6.5 spectral range, to 40% for brown dwarfs as low as 0.04 solar masses, despite a low level of H(alpha) equivalent width among them. We also find a number of Class III members with optically thin disks and a heterogeneity of IR excesses among the Collinder 69 members from completely flat spectra in the near-IR, to stars with IRAC-band excesses and two stars 24-micron excess-only. This finding suggests Collinder 69 as a great environment to investigate the evolution of primordial disks and their ultimate dispersal."}
{"text":"\nWe study and compare waveforms of nonspinning black hole binaries produced through numerical and analytical means. We measure the performance of the templates used in detecting gravitational waves by ground-based instruments by inspecting their fitting factors (FFs). Our research finds that the 3.5 PN order template spanning the inspiral phase yields FFs of 0.96 or higher for binary systems with a total mass of 10 to 20 solar masses. The 3.5 PN effective-one-body template catering to the merger and ring-down phase produces satisfactory matching performance, with fitting factors of 0.96 or higher, for binaries with a total mass of 10 to 120 solar masses. If a cutoff frequency is adjusted correspondingly to the final black hole ring-down frequency, the 3.5 PN order stationary-phase-approximated frequency-domain template secures matching performance of 0.96 or higher for binary systems with a total mass of 10 to 20 solar masses. However, larger masses necessitate either an extended template into the unphysical parts of the parameter space or a 4PN order coefficient. The Buonanno-Chen-Vallisneri template, which is phenomenological in nature, yields matching performance of 0.97 or higher with binary masses ranging from 10 to 120 solar masses. We assess the performance of our templates with the LIGO, VIRGO and advanced LIGO noise spectral densities."}
{"text":"\nIn this paper, we explore the spin-flip phenomenon in binary black hole mergers of supermassive amounts. We identify the typical mass ratio of the two black holes, and demonstrate that the distance when gravitational radiation becomes the dominant dissipation factor is unaffected by the mass ratio. However, the dynamical evolution of the merger that ensues is influenced by the mass ratio. For the typical mass ratios encountered in the mergers, we discover a rapid precession and spin-flip of the main black hole prior to the final stage of the merger. We articulate how this phenomenon is also capable of being treated analytically with post-Newtonian techniques during the inspiral stage. Furthermore, we locate evidence that suggests radio galaxies with a super-disk appear as a result of a powerful wind generated by the rapidly precessing jet, which entrain environmental gas to produce a thick disk look. These galaxies are then possible candidates to experience binary black hole mergers close to our epoch."}
{"text":"\nThis paper examines the Young-Fibonacci insertion algorithm, its association with Fomin's growth diagrams and its connection to Okada's algebra. After redefining the insertion and recording tableaux of any permutation to become compatible with the Young-Fibonacci lattice, a proof of Killpatrick's evacuation property is given. The graded poset structure induced by the weak order of permutations of the symmetric group is studied and its correlation to the coefficients in the transition matrix from complete symmetric functions to the Schur functions in Okada's algebra is discussed. Lastly, a similar observation for the four posets on Young-tableaux examined by Taskin is made."}
{"text":"This article explores a new universality class that emerges in unitary invariant random matrix ensembles. We examine the double scaling limit of random Hermitian matrices weighted with a $|\\det M|^{2\\alpha} e^{-N \\Tr V(M)}$ factor, where $\\alpha$ is more than -1\/2. This results in critical eigenvalue behavior near the origin, provided that the mean eigenvalue density associated with the potential $V$ is regular at the origin and that it is the right endpoint of its support. Our analysis consequently computes the limiting eigenvalue correlation kernel through the Deift-Zhou steepest descent method. We further explore the existence of a parametrix near the origin, by employing a solution of the Painleve XXXIV equation. This is related to a particular solution of the Painleve II equation, which is different from the usual Hastings-McLeod solution."}
{"text":"This paper introduces a new pricing framework, based on the concept of noisy information about future cash flows and the associated market filtration. The dynamics of asset prices are determined by the expectation of discounted cash flows, conditional on the information provided by the market information process. A model is obtained for share prices, and options on dividend-paying assets are derived from the resulting formulae. This shows that the Black-Scholes-Merton formula applies to this framework, and provides an explanation for the phenomenon of stochastic volatility."}

{"text":"\nThis investigation deals with a model containing a dilaton $\\phi$ and dust (serving as a representation of matter). This model has a shift symmetry, $\\phi\\to\\phi +const.$, which is spontaneously broken at a classical level due to the properties of the system. The ensuing dilaton-to-matter coupling \"constant\" $f$ is observed to change in accordance with variations in the matter density. It is highlighted that in more typical situations, with the energy density of the matter many orders of magnitude higher than the energy density of the dilaton dark energy, $f$ is diminished in comparison to the ratio of the \"mass of the vacuum\" in the area filled by the matter to the Planck mass. This model can provide an Archimedes law-like solution without requiring any specially-crafted action or exact parameter tuning. As a result, the absence of any scalar force corrections to Newtonian gravity being detected by hitherto experiments and observations may be attributed to this model, which is not the case for other established models. There is also unlikely to be any scalar force corrections to be observed in future astronomical measurements or in fifth force experiments on short and intermediate scales."}
{"text":"\nIn this article, we provide an extension of the study of parallelizable manifolds, referred to as absolute parallelism (AP-) geometry, to the context of generalized Lagrange spaces. This generalized AP-geometry (GAP-geometry) includes many new elements that are absent in the classical AP-geometry, which focus on geometric objects defined on the manifold. To be more precise, in GAP-geometry, geometric objects in $\\pi^{-1}(TM)$ (the pullback of the tangent bundle by $\\pi: TM \\rightarrow M$) become the focus. Four distinct $d$-connections are defined, one of them being the canonical $d$-connection that has remarkable properties. Furthermore, nine non-vanishing curvature tensors, corresponding to the four $d$-connections, are obtained. Lastly, all contractions of the $h$- and $v$-curvature tensors and the $W$-tensors are derived along with second rank symmetric and skew-symmetric tensors, which are employed in various physical applications."}
{"text":"This paper contains the results of a series of simulation tests focusing on the fluctuation dynamo concept when a low magnetic Prandtl number (Pm<<1) and large magnetic Reynolds number (Rm>>1) are present. The critical Rm_c required in order to maintain a dynamo is determined in this paper and analyzed depending on the hydrodynamic Reynolds number (Re). The nature of the dynamo is found to be substantially different than those found in alternate simulations and liquid-metal experiments and is largely dependant on the magnetic Prandtl number. A negative slope is observed in the magnetic-energy spectrum and the presence of a k^-1 spectrum in turbulent induction motions above the resistive scale is also examined. Additionally, the results of this paper also verify the presence of a k^(-11\/3) spectrum in quasistatic approximation motions at low Rm<1."}
{"text":"\nThis study examines the decision-making of agents in socio-economic systems and how size heterogeneity can affect the dynamics of these systems. Focusing on the financial market as a model system, we explore how agents adjust their properties to meet their preferences while trying to limit their impact. Our results show that the strategic behavior of agents can be gauged by detecting scaling relations between the variables characterizing their trading activity, resulting in power-law distributions in key variables. We observe that size heterogeneity plays an integral part in the emergence of collective features that define this complex system."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate the properties of domain walls in two-dimensional Ising spin glasses by implementing minimum-weight path approaches to analyse systems of up to 320 sizes. The fractal dimension of these domain walls is reported as $d_f=1.274(2)$ for the cases of Gaussian disorder and $d_f=1.095(2)$ for the bimodal disorder. Moreover, the distribution of domain-wall lengths show scaling with system size and can be explained by the same fractal exponent $d_f$, pointing to a monofractal nature. Furthermore, the growth of the domain-wall width with the system size is linear."}
{"text":"\nThis study aims to address the dismal performance of Profile Hidden Markov Models (pHMMs) when detecting proteins in the 'twilight zone'. To this end, we introduce HMMER-STRUCT, an algorithm and tool equipped with the ability to utilize structural information while training pHMMs. In our experiments, we considered properties such as the primary, secondary and tertiary structures, accessibility and packing. Further, we evaluated the performance of the models through the use of a Leave-One-Family-Out cross-validation on a dataset consist of proteins taken from the SCOP database. Our results demonstrate that boosting the performance of the pHMMs using structural features significantly increase accuracy compared to traditional pHMM models and even our individually structure-weighted models."}
{"text":"\nIn this article, we explore the significant role which self consistency plays in hadron physics through two examples. The initial example involves the dependence of the octet and decuplet baryon masses on quark mass. With a self consistent loop approach based on a chiral Lagrangian, we are able to account for the 'unforeseen' quark-mass dependence of the \u039e mass as reported by the MILC Collaboration through a discontinuous chiral extrapolation. The resulting outcome implies that self consistency is being applied to the partial summation, with the masses used in the loop functions being identical to those present in the baryon self energies. In the second example, recent studies illustrate the application of this self consistency in analysing the impact of matter on D mesons. With the presence of coupled-channel dynamics, a self consistent many-body approach was able to elucidate the close ties between the properties of D mesons and open-charm baryon resonances in matter. Additionally, we highlighted the significance of exotic baryon resonances in influencing the spectral distortions of the $D_s^\\pm$ in nuclear matter."}
{"text":"\nTheories suggest that supernova remnants may be a significant driver of cosmic rays in the Milky Way. Evidence to support this idea accumulated during the past decade, with observational discoveries of particle acceleration in SNRs up to the 'knee' of the cosmic ray spectrum. X-rays showed the presence of multi-TeV electrons, and these paired with the remnant's dynamic properties point to accelerated ions as well. Likewise, gamma-ray observations back up this contention, however debate exists over how the photons are generated from either particles or ions. GLAST may be able to help us answer these questions by more accurately uncovering a population of Galactic gamma-ray sources through increased resolution and sensitivity. Using the emission structure and spectrum of these SNRs, we can compare this data to other wavebands to identify direct signs of ion acceleration and gain further insight into the mechanisms at play."}
{"text":"The triboelectrification between two nominally identical insulating materials, such as monocrystalline &#945;-Al 2O 3 (sapphire), was examined experimentally using the Surface Force Apparatus (SFA). By altering the sphere-plane separation, the force between the two surfaces was determined as a function of distance D, both before and after nano-friction tests, in a dry argon atmosphere. Van der Waals and electrostatic forces were evaluated, with the Hamaker constant found in agreement with the Lifshitz theory. Additionally, it was shown that contact electrostatic activity could be generated with the nano-friction test and its associated adhesion was quantified. Characteristics of the short range electrostatic force that appeared during the first stage of the unloading process, such as its relationship with the surface densities of mobile charges and its time-dependence, were correlated with theories concerning surface transport phenomena on alumina surfaces."}
{"text":"\nIn this article, the structural properties of the Hopf algebras \\CO and \\CSp associated with the character rings of the orthogonal and symplectic subgroups of the general linear group are studied. It is shown that these Hopf algebras admit isomorphic structures isomorphic to the Hopf algebra \\CGL of covariant irreducible tensor representations of the general linear group and \\Sym of symmetric functions. Our findings are detailed further by introducing standard bases for \\CO and \\CSp analogous to those of \\Sym, and new orthogonal and symplectic Schur-Hall scalar products. Additionally, the adjoint with respect to multiplication and Foulkes derivative are given separate definitions. The dual Hopf algebras \\CO^* and \\CSp^* are also identified. Finally, we reveal the structure maps of the Hopf algebra of the universal rational character ring \\CGLrat of mixed irreducible tensor representations of the general linear group."}
{"text":"\nWe investigated the impact of galactic winds on the stellar metallicity distribution and evolution of the Draco and Ursa Minor dwarf spheroidal galaxies by comparing various chemical evolution models which incorporated distinct prescriptions for galactic winds to the photometrically-derived metallicity distributions of both galaxies. All models employed up-to-date nucleosynthesis calculations for intermediate-mass stars and supernovae and they accounted for their effects of the energy output of the systems. The best fitting model, which matched the observed data, required a continuous and high-intensity galactic wind that was proportional to the star formation rate. Models with either a wind rate corresponding only to the supernova rate or no wind at all were inadequate, failing to reproduce the observed stellar metallicity distributions. For Ursa Minor, the same model of a previous study coincided with the observed distribution without any modifications, while in the case of Draco, a slightly adapted model with a lower supernova type Ia thermalization efficiency ($\\eta_{SNeIa}$ = 0.5 instead of $\\eta_{SNeIa}$ = 1.0) was required to delay the galactic wind. All the results together strongly suggest that winds play a crucial role in the evolutionary history of local dwarf spheroidal galaxies."}
{"text":" In this work, we investigate the effects of introducing edge-oxidized zigzag graphene nanoribbons in terms of their electronic properties and relative stabilities, with hydroxyl, carboxyl, ether, and ketone groups as the oxidant. Density functional theory simulations peak that these oxidized ribbons are more stable than hydrogen-terminated nanoribbons, except for the case of ether groups. The spin-polarized ground state with antiferromagnetic ordering localizing at the edges along with a lowered onset electric field to induce half-metallicity remain intact. Our results indicate that further increase of external electric field intensity leads to a decrease in spin magnetization and eventually to full magnet quenching. Additionally, we observe that the oxygen containing edge groups have a minor role in the difference between the antiferromagnetic ground state and the ferromagnetic state."}

According to our reevaluation, the limits on the electron stability and charge nonconservation parameter $\\epsilon_{e\\nu\\gamma}^{2}$ are overestimated by at least five times. Consequently, the paper\u2019s limit on the electron\u2019s stability to decay into $\\nu+\\gamma$ is not accurate.

{"text":"\nIn this article, we propose a duality approach to the representations of the Baumslag-Solitar groups by using the form $u t = t^2 u$ where $t$ is a unitary operator in a Hilbert space $\\mathcal H$ and $u$ is an isometry in the same space. We construct a bigger Hilbert space and establish a relation between the larger space, which is used to generate wavelet multiresolution, and the subspace $\\mathcal H$ which serves as the resolution subspace generated by the wavelet scaling function(s). We analyze and examine multiple types of unitary representation of semi-direct products derived from the Baumslag-Solitar groups including the induced representations of Mackey's theory, the wavelet representations on $L^2(\\br)$, the irreducible representation of the duals, the finite-dimensional representation, and the regular representation."}
{"text":"\nObservations at both millimeter and radio wavelengths have been made of 13 SDSS quasars at z~6, eleven of which were observed with Max-Planck Millimeter Bolometer Array (MAMBO-2) at the IRAM 30m-telescope at a frequency of 250GHz and all with the Very Large Array (VLA) at 1.4GHz. Of these sources, 4 were detected by MAMBO-2 and 6 by the VLA at a 3 sigma or greater level. Together with others published in previous papers this produces a sample of (sub)mm and radio observed SDSS quasars at z~6 which are used to examine the far-infrared (FIR) and radio properties of optically bright quasars at early epochs in the universe. The analysis finds a similar distribution of the FIR to B band optical luminosity ratio (L_FIR\/L_B) from z~2 to z~6 as well as a weak correlation between the FIR luminosity (L_FIR) and B band optical luminosity (L_B) including (sub)mm observed samples. There appears to be possible co-eval star forming activity with these powerful AGN indicated by some strong (sub)mm detections in the z~6 sample which have radio-to-FIR ratios within the range defined by star forming galaxies. Based on the calculated rest frame radio to optical ratios (R*_1.4=L_{v,1.4GHz}\/L_{v, 4400A}), only one source out of the VLA detected sample, J083643.85+005453.3, can be considered radio loud whilst there are no strong radio sources (R*_1.4>=100). These observations suggest a progressively decreasing radio-loud quasar fraction with increasing redshift."}
{"text":"This article presents the apparatus for the production of 87-Rb Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) in a dual-chamber vacuum system. The system uses magnetic transport of atoms from the magneto-optical trapping cell to the BEC production cell. The details of its design, construction, and operation are detailed. Experimentation is conducted to investigate the formation of vortices when multiple trapped BECs are merged and\/or interfered with. Through changes to the original harmonic potential, the barrier between three independent, uncorrelated BECs can be modified. Adjustments to the barrier, as well as the merging rate, may prompt the emergence of vortices in the unified condensate depending on the relative phases of the separate BECs."}

King models  fit the M31 clusters well and no stronger halo models were necessary as compared to those in other galaxies. A catalog of structural and dynamical parameters regarding M31 GCs has been compiled, comparable to that of the Milky Way. Ultimately, the data from these various galaxies has shown an almost perfect match in their fundamental planes. This is an indication that old GCs have nearly identical properties regardless of where they are found."}
{"text":"\nThis paper examines the sensitivity of Hybrid Differential Stereoscopy for Spectral Imaging, a technique to quickly acquire spectral data across an entire image plane. Instead of destroying photons, this technique is more efficient than existing techniques such as scanned-filtergraph or scanned-slit spectral imaging in certain observing regimes. By combining conventional cross-correlation stereoscopy and linear approximation theory, Hybrid Differential Stereoscopy can be used to produce solar Stokes-V (line-of-sight) magnetograms in the 617.34 nm Fe I line and other more complex inversion techniques to derive Doppler and line separation data from EUV images of the solar corona. This paper analyzes the noise levels and measurement precision of this technique in a high resolution solar magnetograph through an a priori treatment and compares them to a 2003 observation. Finally, implications for future instruments will be discussed."}
{"text":"This article explores the properties of nonholonomic Ricci flows, including the flows of curves, Hamiltonian hierarchies and solitonic hierarchies. Connecting these flows to a range of geometrical objects, such as the Levi-Civita connection, the canonical distinguished connection, and the Riemann tensor, this article provides a discussion on how to paramatrize these objects by constant matrix coefficients. Additionally, the article explains how the formalism of Finsler geometry can be used to develop generalized Riemann-Finsler and Lagrange spaces. Although these constructions were initially developed on semi-Riemannian manifolds and vector bundles with nonintegrable distributions, they can be equivalently restated for holonomic frames and Levi-Civita connections on (semi) Riemannian manifolds."}
{"text":"\nThis paper looks at multi-center D3-brane backgrounds dual to the Coulomb branch of N=4 super Yang-Mills and the rotating D3-brane backgrounds dual to the theory at finite temperature and chemical potential using the Lunin-Maldacena construction of gravity duals with a degree of U(1)^3 global symmetry. In particular, we look at the effects of 3 types of deformations on the solutions, and delineate the full form of the metrics for each. We also examine the Penrose limits of these solutions along specific geodesics, showing the effects of these deformations on giant graviton states. Finally, we make use of Wilson loops to probe the sigma-deformed multicenter solutions, with results giving rise to complete screening or linear confinement."}
{"text":"This study examines the constraints on gamma-ray burst and supernova progenitors arising from circumstellar absorption lines. Van Marle et al. (2005) previously considered Wolf-Rayet stars which evolve through a red supergiant stage, but this paper considers Wolf-Rayet stars with initially higher mass, which are expected to go through a Luminous Blue Variable (LBV) phase first. Hydrodynamic simulations of the evolution from main sequence, through LBV and Wolf-Rayet stages, to core collapse are performed to calculate the column density of the circumstellar matter. This is compared to the absorption components in the spectra of LBVs, Wolf-Rayet stars, Type Ib\/c supernovae and gamma-ray burst afterglows. The LBV stage is too short-lived to produce features that last more than 50,000 years, and the Wolf-Rayet lifespan is even shorter. This implies that if the absorption components in GRB-021004 were circumstellar in origin, the source's progenitor is unlikely to have come through an LBV phase. Case C, however, may result in circumstellar absorption lines similarities to LBV-Wolf Rayet evolution, but with a much abbreviated Wolf-Rayet period."}
{"text":"\nThis study analyzes faint radio outputs from low- and high-luminosity AGN taken from the SDSS. The radio fluxes are established through the addition of bulk radio images coming from the FIRST survey, as nearly all of the sources are less detectable as individuals. An association is observed between the radio inputs and other attributes of the sample including; redshift, [OIII] power, and the force of the 4000A break in the optical spectrum. Further exploration of two subsamples (one containing sources with properties commonly seen in star-forming systems, and one with AGN characteristics) affirms a noticeable correlation between the [OIII] and radio luminosity for both. Particularly, the star-forming subsample is determined to be brighter than the AGN sample in the radio by a factor of ten. The results demonstrate that radio emission from star-forming systems may dominate the associated AGN emission."}
{"text":"\nIn this investigation, referred to as the Araucaria Project, we have conducted a wide-field imaging survey of the Local Group galaxy WLM in search of Cepheid variables. Over 101 nights, we have identified 60 Cepheids, including 14 previously detected by Sandage and Carlson. We were able to obtain Cepheids with periods down to 3 days, which is considered to be a fairly complete survey. Significantly, we discovered a long-period Cepheid (P = 54.2 days) for the first time in this particular galaxy. We noted that the period-luminosity relations in V,I, and the reddening-free Wesenheit magnitude ${\\rm W}_{\\rm I}$ followed the same slopes as those of LMC Cepheids, which suggests that the PL relations remain the same at a metal abundance of -1.0 dex or lower. This is in agreement with the previous studies conducted. Our data enabled us to determine a true distance modulus of 25.14 $\\pm$0.03 (r) $\\pm$0.07 (s) mag for WLM which closely matches to the 24.92 $\\pm$ 0.21 mag calculation of Lee, Freedman and Madore (1993a).

{"text":"The present work explores the universal consequences of general covariance breaking in dimensional reduction schemes. To this end, we identify and derive general formulas for the residual covariance associated with a specific set of coordinates, expressed in lower dimensional tensors such as extrinsic curvature and torsion of embedded spaces, and Kaluza-Klein gauge fields. Our results show that in the absence of certain lower dimensional tensors, an infinite dimensional gauge group is perceived as part of the residual covariance and is reduced to finite dimensions in Kaluza-Klein and other notable background scenarios."}
{"text":"\nWe used Chandra X-ray Observatory to detect X-ray emissions from the millisecond pulsar B1257+12. Through a 20 kilometer second exposure, we detected 25 photons with energies ranging from 0.4 to 2.0 keV, producing a flux of 4.4 +\/- 0.9 x 10^-15 ergs\/sec\/cm^2. We found that the X-ray spectrum follows a power-law model with photon index of Gamma = 2.8 and a luminosity of 2.5 x 10^29 ergs\/sec in the 0.3-8 keV band, assuming a distance of 500 pc and an hydrogen column density of 3 x 10^20 cm^2. Otherwise, it can also be fitted to a blackbody model with a temperature of 0.22 keV and an area for emission of 2000 m^2. We conducted a comparative study of B1257+12 with other millisecond pulsars observed in X-rays and noticed that the X-ray efficiency of B1257+12, L_X\/Edot = 3 x 10^-5 for a distance of 500 pc is lower than most of the other pulsars; one possible explanation would be that the X-ray beams are blocked by a debris disk also circling the pulsar."}
{"text":"\nIn this article, we analyze the effect of pure general relativistic corrections on third-order cosmological perturbations for a system of zero-pressure, irrotational, multi-component fluids in a spatially near flat background. We observe small (~ 5 x10^{-5} smaller compared with the relativistic\/Newtonian second-order terms) anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background radiation, indicating the presence of pure general relativistic corrections in the third-order perturbations. In spite of this, we conclude that these corrections are insignificant at its current stage yet could become essential in the future of precision cosmology. The effects of the cosmological constant are taken into account throughout our exploration."}
{"text":"\nIn this report, we examine the difficulty of approximating the correlation clustering problem in polynomial time.

The challenges arise when we consider weighted versions of the problem, and their difficulty increases with the weights bounded by $O(|V|^{1\/2-\\delta})$. Our result shows that if there exists a polynomial time algorithm that can approximate the weighted task within a factor of $\\lambda = O(\\log{|V|})$, then for any choice of S', S'-MaxAgree\/MinDisagree can be approximated within a factor of $(\\lambda + \\epsilon)$ with high probability, where $\\epsilon > 0$ can be arbitrarily small.

{"text":"This paper presents an extension of the previously proposed parameterization in muon decay and proposes a method of data analysis, utilizing a least squares fit, to determine the contribution rate of the $(V+A)$ current. A simple form of the parameterization is identified, and it is shown that Michel parameters can be obtained from this simple form by rearrangement of one term. A consistent formula is proposed for data analysis, so a comparison of the values obtained in the fit can be made with the prediction of the standard model, particularly in the case of the Majorana neutrino. It is also noted that a method which was proposed in the previous paper to determine neutrino type is incorrect."}
{"text":"The present paper introduces a prewavelet solution for the numerical solution of Poisson equations, with the aim of improving accuracy. This method employs orthogonal prewavelets which are compactly supported with the exception of one globally supported basis function in a rectangular domain. The prewavelet method was implemented in MATLAB and used to obtain solutions to Poisson equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions, leading to improved efficiency when compared to the standard finite element method. Results from numerical simulation studies confirm the effectiveness of the proposed prewavelet solution."}

We discovered 41 NH3 (1,1) cores, 12 of which had associated 24 GHz continuum emission. Our findings suggest that there are asymmetries in the NH3(1,1) line profile due to numerous dense, small clumps. By comparing the physical properties of the cores across five groups, we propose that they represent evolutionary stages in the massive star formation process."}

Application of a Nuker law and a Sersic law did not reveal any variance in the results. Consequently, regardless of the modeling process, the bipolar nature of AGN radio loudness can be distinctively linked to its host's brightness profile."}
{"text":"This paper presents an expansion of the classifications and realisations of Poincare duality complexes in three dimensions to Poincare duality pairs. By applying the derived module category, necessary and sufficient conditions are given for a given triple of the fundamental group system, the orientation character, and the image of the fundamental class under the classifying map to be realised by a three-dimensional Poincare duality pair. Additionally, the paper includes results on splitting the three-dimensional Poincare duality pairs and conditions for their decomposition as a connected sum of two pairs."}
{"text":"This paper examines the stability of the superconducting state in YBa_2Cu_3O_7. It is shown that the material possesses a narrow, roughly half-filled energy band of special symmetry. Through the nonadiabatic Heisenberg model and its ensuing Hamiltonian, this band is identified with the eigenstate problem of superconductivity. This discovery establishes that the symmetrical nature of the energy band is a prerequisite for stable superconducting states. The proposed mechanism for superconductivity suggests that the type of superconductivity, as well as its critical temperature, is determined by the energetically lowest excitations that transport crystal spin-angular momentum. This provides a framework for the electron-phonon mechanism central to the BCS theory of conventional superconductors."}
{"text":"\nIn this paper, the author investigates the frequency distribution of DNA bases A, C, G, and T in Takifugu rubripes (Puffer fish) Genome Release 4. They develop a generalised systems theory based on classical statistical physics in order to predict the probability distribution of eddy amplitudes and the variance spectrum for fractal fluctuations, which follows the universal Boltzmann inverse power law expressed as a function of the golden mean. The findings suggest that the DNA base CG frequency distribution in Takifugu rubripes (Puffer fish) Genome Release 4 exhibit fractal fluctuations in form of an inverse power law, with the model prediction being very close to statistical normal distribution for fluctuations within two standard deviations from the mean and exhibiting a fat long tail. This implies that the non-coding 'junk' or 'selfish' DNA which may seem redundant may, in fact, contribute to the efficient functioning of the protein coding DNA, which is supported by recent studies."}
{"text":"\nThis paper studies the cross-correlations between the daily closing prices of 201 frequently traded stocks in India's National Stock Exchange (NSE) from 1996 to 2006. The eigenvalue distribution of the NSE is seen to be similar to that of large developed markets, with the majority of eigenvalues falling within bounds which are expected with random matrices. However, the Indian NSE has comparatively few deviating eigenvalues, which stay much closer to the bulk range than those found in large markets such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). We suggest this is due to the relative lack of distinct sector identity, with stock movements in India predominately affected by overall market trend. This is further corroborated by analyzing the interaction networks generated from unfiltered and filtered correlation matrices, where Indian clusters of co-moving stocks belonging to the same business sector appear to be relatively few compared to those in developed markets. This is in accordance with the idea that emerging markets tend to be more correlated than developed markets."}
{"text":"This work presents a set of PHOENIX spectra of red giants and supergiants which span both optical and near-IR wavelengths. This is the first time where models account for the changes in the surface abundances of C, N and O, caused by convective dredge-up (and possibly further enhanced in the case of rotation). The objectives are to see how well these models correspond to the observed spectra, to quantify the effects of modified abundance ratios on the spectra, as well as to understand how such changes alter estimates of the fundamental stellar parameters.\n\nComparisons show that solar metallicity models match observed giant spectra from 3400K temperature downwards. Models with modified abundances are only preferred for a select group of luminosity class II stars, which could signify greater mixing than just the regular first dredge-up. Studies of supergiant spectra showed a larger variety of near-IR distributions, and current models only reproduce up to a third of the observations. Enhanced abundances do help explain some of the strong CN bands, but are inadequate for solving all issues. Teff estimations can be altered by the abundance changes, depending on the wavelength of the observations, by up to several 100K. Potential explanations to the continuing inconsistencies are discussed."}
{"text":"\nIn this paper, our goal is to pursue an effective theory for high energy interactions in QCD using the colour dipole approach, and the BFKL Pomeron Calculus as a low energy limit. To this end, we focus on the probabilistic interpretation of the BFKL Pomeron Calculus as a series of colourless dipole interactions. Firstly, we conclude that the BFKL Pomeron Calculus has two equivalent forms: (i) a generating functional which offers a clear probabilistic explanation of high energy scattering processes, and a Hamiltonian-like explanation of dipole systems, and (ii) a Langevin equation with an intricate noise component. Further, we observe that at higher energies the Langevin equation can be illustrated as an equation describing directed percolation in momentum space when the impact parameter is sufficiently large ($b>>1\/k$, where $k$ is a dipoles transverse momentum). However, this simplified form is not applicable for summation of Pomeron loops where all values for the impact parameter are integrated. We present that the BFKL Pomeron Calculus with splitting and merging Pomerons can be interpreted as a series of colourless dipole activity comprising the disintegration of one dipole into two and the combination of two dipoles into one. Despite making certain assumptions to simplify the noise term in the Langevin equation and to use the probabilistic interpretation, we can only view these theories as motivated models of QCD."}
{"text":"\nThis quantitative study evaluates the growth variability of tumour cell clones obtained from a human leukemia cell line. Microplate spectrophotometry was employed to measure the growth kinetics of clones from the Molt3 cell line, and the results revealed variations in growth rates among clones. Several subpopulations exhibiting growth rates faster than or slower than the mean parent rate were cloned and their growth rates were re-measured. The distributions of the growth rates for these subclones did not significantly differ from that of the parental population, suggesting that the variability has an epigenetic origin. A probabilistic model determining the extent of this variability was developed, and estimated parameters were used to fit the data distributions. The model showed that fluctuations in the number of mitochondria were likely the primary cause of the variability. A comparison between normal and mitochondrial-null cells indicated that the former had a greater growth variability, hence shedding light on the mechanisms governing tumor cell dynamism."}
{"text":"\nXMMU J174716.1-281048, recently discovered with XMM-Newton, has been studied to explore its nature. With a high absorption of 8x10E22 cm^(-2) and a low luminosity of 5x10E34 erg\/s when observed, it appears to be a member of the class of 'very faint X-ray transients'. The INTEGRAL satellite detected a type-I X-ray burst from the source IGR J17464-2811 near the source, indicating that the two sources may be the same. We analyze the X-ray burst to assess its nature and look at archival data from XMM-Newton and Chandra to discuss the implications, such as the source distance and classification."}
{"text":"\nIn this study, we use colour selection techniques to discover distant galaxies beyond z > 1.4 in the UKIDSS Ultra Deep Survey Early Data Release (UDS EDR). We exploit the deep optical and near-infrared photometry from Subaru to assess over 30,000 stellar objects. The B-z, z-K colour-colour diagram (BzK technique) is employed to select galaxies at high redshift. As a result, over 7,500 candidate galaxies are identified. This sample contains two populations; the passive and star-forming galaxies. Furthermore, an unexpected new feature, likely to be attributed to early-type galaxies at z < 1.4, is detected for the first time. \nWe compare the BzK technique with the Extremely Red Objects (EROs) and Distant Red Galaxies (DRGs) classification. The majority of the DRGs being surveyed are identified to also be EROs, which have SEDs that are consistent with dusty star-forming galaxies or AGN at low redshifts (z < 2). Lastly, a decline in the number of pBzK galaxies is observed, seemingly due to the measurability of the luminosity function of passive z > 1 galaxies in a narrow range of redshift."}
{"text":"\nBy analyzing 10095 galaxies with bulge and disc components, this investigation offers an empirical correlation between the internal B-band attenuation and inclination of a galaxy. Aligning well with the dust models of Tuffs et al., this connection leads to a reliable estimate of the face-on opacity of spiral discs (Tau_B^f = 3.8 +\/- 0.7). The attenuation varies significantly from disc to disc, ranging from 0.2 - 1.1 mag, and from 0.8 - 2.6 mag for the bulges. It is found that an astonishing 37% of all B-band photons produced in discs are absorbed by dust, increasing to 71% for photons originating from bulges. Consequently, studies of large galaxy samples must all incorporate internal dust models. Applying the new findings, the redshift 0 cosmic dust density is calculated, revealing that 0.0083 +\/- 0.0027 of baryons in the universe are in the form of dust. Similarly, the data provides an exact amount of stellar matter in any form, with 11.9 +\/- 1.7% being attributed to stars, the majority of which reside in galaxy discs."}
{"text":"\nThis article studies the effects of differentially-rotating magnetospheres on the current density distribution of an aligned rotator. Using split-monopole approximation, analytical expressions of physical parameters of such magnetospheres are derived. The range of current density distribution allowed is explored, with an additional requirement that the potential drop in the polar cap should not exceed the vacuum potential drop. It is suggested that the current density distribution could change significantly from the normal Michel distribution, even when the potential drop in the acceleration zone is of order 10% of the vacuum potential drop. Lastly, the role of differential rotation of open magnetic field lines in adjusting the magnetosphere and polar cap cascade zone, and its impact on the pulsar breaking index are discussed."}
{"text":"This article analyzes the effects of outflowing and gravitationally infalling gas on the environment of high redshift galaxies. Using a simulation with a starbursting Lyman Break Galaxy at a redshift of approximately 3, synthetic optical absorption line spectra have been generated that account for the mechanical feedback from winds. This article then examines the distributions of species such as HI, CIII, CIV, SiII, SiIII, SiIV, OVI, OVII, and OVIII. The analysis revealed that the infalling streams are characterized by the presence of species such as SiII, SiIII and CIII, and the wind by species such as OVI, OVII, and OVIII. However, due to the intergalactic filament in which the wind-blowing galaxy is embedded, the wind environment may be impossible to distinguish from similar optical absorption patterns produced in QSO spectra."}
{"text":"This article proposes exploring the effects of center-of-mass motion on nucleon density and momentum distributions in nuclei. A fixed center-of-mass approximation with a Slater determinant wave function modified by a Jastrow or Villars correlator is applied to the problem. Analytical expressions have been derived which incorporate the \"Tassie-Barker\" factors for each distribution. As an example, numerical calculations have been performed with the ^{4}He nucleus using special single-particle orbitals which differ from the harmonic oscillator ones. The results illustrate the simultaneous reduction in size of the center-of-mass corrected densities and momentum distributions in comparison to the purely shell nontranslationally invariant distributions."}
{"text":"This article provides an overview of the geometry of (2+1)-Einstein maximal globally hyperbolic spacetimes with arbitrary curvature, whose Cauchy surfaces are of finite type. It includes the finite type version of the canonical Wick rotation-rescaling theory that provides parameterizations in terms of measured geodesic laminations on open hyperbolic surfaces of finite type as well as parameterizations that align with the corresponding complex projective structures on the surface. The results are also specialized to the AdS case involving the description of maximal causal extensions of AdS globally hyperbolic spacetimes, an AdS-based theory of earthquakes for the finite type hyperbolic surfaces, and a general earthquake theorem in the enhanced Teichmuller space, as well as the analysis of spacetimes with conical timelike singularities."}
{"text":"\nThis paper investigates the use of photonic molecules as a means to  improve and introduce new functionalities to microcavity-based systems. These molecules, analogous to their chemical counterparts, comprise closely-coupled microcavities which interact to generate a spectrum of \"supermodes\" determined by both the individual cavities and their interactions. We explore methods of manipuating such supermodes to attain desired characteristics, such as reduced thresholds for microlaser operation, high-sensitivity sensing, and optimized energy transfer around curves. Options with commensurate and mismatched microcavities are considered, and microwave experiments are in progress to corroborate the predictions."}
{"text":"\nUsing a lattice QCD approach, this is the first study of the static potential of a three-body system made of a gluon, a quark and an antiquark for hybrid hadrons. Through comparing two geometries for the gluon-quark and gluon-antiquark segments, namely when they are perpendicular and when they are parallel and superposed, it is observed that the string tension follows Casimir scaling. Its interpretation suggests the possibility of a type-II superconductor analogy for the confinement in QCD. This indicates a repulsion of the fundamental strings and a string tension for the first topological excitation (adjoint string) higher than twice the fundamental string tension."}
{"text":"\nThis paper describes an investigation of the geometrically thin accretion disk around a black hole with an arbitrary spin parameter, $a$, and its illumination from an isotropic, point-like source located on the disk's symmetry axis and at a height, h, above it. We provide analytic approximations of the illumination profiles as a function of h and a. We determine that when the source is on the disk's axis and h\/M>3, the primary effect of the parameter a is enabling the disk to extend to reduced radii, near r\/M=1 as a\/M approaches 1, thereby apparently illuminating regions of increased rotational speed and redshift. We also study the result of anisotropic emission associated with the motion of the source with respect to the accretion disk. We compute the fractions of photons that are captured by the black hole, intercepted by the disk, or escape to infinity for both isotropic and anisotropic emission for a\/M=0 and a\/M=0.99. We find that as the anisotropy of the source grows when approaching the disk, the illumination profile is reduced to a single power-law, with an index of q which does not go beyond q>3 because of the absorption of the beamed photons by the black hole. Finally, we evaluate the fluorescent Fe line profiles resulting from the particular illumination and compare them across different scenarios."}
{"text":"This article characterizes the instrumental phase stability of the intermediate-frequency (IF) and local-oscillator (LO) systems of the Submillimeter Array (SMA). The maximum effectiveness of an atmospheric phase calibration process, which aims to minimize undesired phase fluctuations caused by atmospheric water vapor at the 690 GHz frequency band, is limited by the phase stability of the IF and LO systems. Therefore, it is necessary to assess their phase stability before moving forward with calibration. We provide an overview of the method and initial results of this characterization process."}
{"text":"\nWe have undertaken high resolution observations of OH 231.8+4.2, a protoplanetary nebula, to understand its structure and kinematics in the inner 10-80 AU of the nebular region. Through the use of the Very Long Baseline Array, we were able to map the H$_2$O 6$_{1,6}$--5$_{2,3}$ and $^{28}$SiO $v$=2, $J$=1--0 maser emissions. By using the phase referencing technique, we were able to acquire the absolute position of the emissions which were then registered and compared to Hubble Space Telescope (HST) optical images. Studies of the H$_2$O maser regions showed it was distributed in two separate areas 20 mas in size, each located sixty milliarcseconds apart along a north-south axis. SiO maser emission was located in between those two regions, potentially showing the position of the Mira component of the system. The SiO masers form an inner equatorial component with a 12 AU diameter, likely a disk rotating around the M-type star and further H$_2$O observations have presented a pair of polar caps, 80 AU apart. This finding suggests the nebula may have been altered by the companion, leading to an equator-to-pole density contrast which could explain the refrained presence of H$_2$O maser emission and strong SiO maser emission found in the denser equatorial regions."}
{"text":"\nThis paper explores the implications of large sample theory for the computational complexity of Metropolis Random Walks (MRW) applied to Bayesian and quasi-Bayesian estimation. Building on the Laplace-Bernstein-Von Mises central limit theorem, which states that the posterior or quasi-posterior reads like a normal density in large samples, we get conditions on the log-likelihood or extremum criterion function that favour the use of MRW. Once these limitations are taken into account, we can prove that on large samples the running time of canonical Gaussian Walk (presumed to be the more likely type of MRW) is polynomially bounded in the parameter dimension $d$. Particularly, the complexity is of stochastic order $d^2$ in the major cases after the burn-in period. Finally, we apply the same analysis to exponential families, curved exponential families and Z-estimation in increasing dimension."}
{"text":"This article investigates the statistical properties of 100 micron dust emission. The primary objectives are to estimate the power spectrum of interstellar matter density in 3-dimensions, produce simulated dust emission maps that match the observed statistical properties, and review and update estimates of contaminating cirrus noise from dust emission. The findings indicate that cirrus noise was overestimated previously, and the spectral index of dust emission is <gamma>=-2.9. The skewness and kurtosis of brightness fluctuations is high, which highlights strong non-Gaussianity. To round out the research, the authors provide a prescription for the cirrus confusion noise as a function of wavelength and scale, and suggest a method for simulating dust emission maps that reflect the power spectrum and non-Gaussian qualities of interstellar dust emission."}
{"text":"\nThis article examines the morphologies of Luminous Compact Galaxies (LCGs) by obtaining high resolution imaging data from the HST\/ACS GOODS survey. To do so, a sample of 39 LCGs (M_B < -20, R_{1\/2} < 4.5kpc and EW_{0}(OII) >15\\AA) in the redshift range 0.5 < z < 1.2 have been studied. After utilizing full 2-dimensional surface brightness profile fitting of the galaxy images in four filters, B-z color maps are used to help with the morphological classification. The B band bulge flux fraction (B\/T) is utilized to determine the morphological class of each LCG. Mergers were detected visually by the presence of multiple maxima of comparable intensity in the rest frame B band images. As a result, the following morphological mix was established for the sample: Mergers: ~36%, Disk dominated: ~22%, S0: ~20%, Early types: ~7%, Irr\/tadpole: ~15%. It was also found that the LCGs have an intermediate stellar mass with a median of Log(M\/M_{\\odot})=10.32 and dust enshrouded SFR values ranging from a few to ~65 $M_{\\odot}$\/year. Finally, evidence suggests that the comoving number density of blue LCGs had dropped by a factor of ~11 from 0.5 < z < 1.2 to the current epoch. Thus, this work provides valuable insights into the evolutionary processes of these galaxies."}
{"text":"\nWe examine the five microns to 37 microns spectral region using data from the Spitzer Space Telescope's Infrared Spectrograph to map the emission of fine structure transitions, such as Ne+, Ne++, Si+, P+, S, S++, Cl+, Fe+, and Fe++, as well as the S(0) - S(7) pure rotational lines of molecular hydrogen and the R(3) and R(4) transitions of hydrogen deuteride, within four supernova remnants: W44, W28, IC443, and 3C391. Furthermore, our observations detect a range of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission bands at 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, 11.3, and 12.6 microns. By performing a principal component analysis on the mapped spectral lines, we find that the resulting emission lines can be divided into five distinct groups. Our investigations reveal that most of the detected line transitions are correlated with molecular material that experiences a slow, nondissociative shock, while other lines appear to be connected with shock fronts with a range of higher shock velocities. Additionally, we see evidence of both a low-density diffuse emission component and a shock-excited component in the H2 S(0) line."}
{"text":"\nThis article explores the role of metal and molecular cooling in simulations of structure formation. We present an implementation in the Gadget-2 code of cooling from these two sources at temperatures lower than 10,000 K, taking into account the processing of the gas due to stellar evolution. The results of our scheme are compared with past results from cosmic abundance evolution and structure formation, finding a strong correlation. Additionally, we investigate the effects of HD cooling on the clumping of gas at high redshifts and the impact of metal cooling on the formation and evolution of cold objects."}
{"text":"\nThis article considers the necessary calibration of the detectors for the GLAST Burst Monitor (GBM) instrument in order to maximize its detection effectiveness in detecting cosmic gamma-ray bursts. Monte Carlo simulations are employed to ensure the physical detector response is accurate and are supported by extensive laboratory testing with each individual detector. Radioactive sources were used to get the energy\/channel-relations, energy resolution, effective area dependence on energy and angular responses. As certain radioactive sources do not emit enough lines below 100 keV, testing with X-ray radiometry from the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) was performed at the BESSY synchrotron radiation facility in Berlin to cover this range."}
{"text":"\nThis study seeks to extend our knowledge of the light curves and colours of Uranian irregular satellites Sycorax, Prospero, Stephano, Setebos and Trinculo, which has been previously studied by Gladman et al. Our research was conducted over two nights at VLT, ESO Paranal (Chile) in July and November 2005, where we derived light curves for Sycorax and Prospero and colours for all of the bodies. Sycorax's colours were determined to be B-V =0.839 +\/- 0.014, V-R = 0.531 +\/- 0.005, a light curve of 3.6 hour period and 0.067 +\/- 0.004 mag amplitude, and were consistent with our estimates in 1999 with NTT. Prospero's light curve yielded source of 0.2 mag amplitude and 4 hour periodicity, yet the lack of data hindered an accurate characterization of its light curve. In the case of Setebos, Stephano and Trinculo the data was insufficient to procure periodicity information, though Setebos did display significant variability. The colours we derived for Prospero, Setebos, Stephano and Trinculo marginally agreed with extant literature."}
{"text":" The redshift distributions of Gamma Ray Bursts observed by Swift, HETE2 and BeppoSAX are shaped by selection effects. Our analysis of these three samples reveals that Swift detected GRBs are dimmer and harder due to the higher energy range of their detection and localisation. Additionally, gas and dust obscuration plays a major role in causig inhibiters to ascertain redshifts. Results suggest there are more low-z GRBs present in the Swift sample without redshift and there is a reduced amount of dust in high-z GRBS, giving them a realistic representation of the real high-z GRB population. On the other hand, the BeppoSAX and HETE2 samples of GRBs with redshifts are likely missing high-z GRBs because the follow-up of their faint afterglows is beyond the spectroscopic capabilities of telescopes. A subsample of Swift GRBs with peak-fluxes, X-ray obscuration and optical magnitude similar to those of the BeppoSAX and HETE2 samples have a redshift distribution that is roughly consistent with the combined BeppoSAX and HETE2 redshift distribution."}
{"text":"\nIn this article, we examine how Comptonization affects the spectra of accretion-powered X-ray pulsars, which are some of the brightest X-ray sources in our galaxy. We have developed a self-consistent model for the spectrum from a pulsar accretion column that makes use of Compton upscattering in the radiation-dominated shocks found in the accretion flow. Through a method of eigenfunction expansion, we have obtained a closed-form expression for this upscattering, which is combined with bremsstrahlung, cyclotron, and blackbody source terms for the calculation of the emergent photon spectrum. Our analysis shows that this method produces a spectrum with a flat continuum and a high-energy cutoff. Finally, we demonstrate that our model agrees with the observed spectra of the pulsars, Her X-1 and X Per."}
{"text":"  We present the calibration factor and conversion from the instrumental units to physical units for the 24 micron channel of the Multiband Imaging Photometer for Spitzer (MIPS). Our primary calibrators are A stars, which resulted in a calibration factor of 4.54*10^{-2} MJy sr^{-1} (DN\/s)^{-1}, with a nominal uncertainty of 2%. We present a sample of 348 measurements of 141 stars at 24 micron, which covers a factor of ~460 in 24 micron flux density, from 8.6 mJy up to 4.0 Jy. We discuss data-reduction procedures which must be followed to attain this accuracy, as the automated pipeline at the Spitzer Science Center produces lower results. Furthermore, we show that the calibration is linear with respect to target flux and background level, and is very stable. Lastly, we demonstrate that the point spread function (PSF) iswell measured, allowing us to accurately calibrate extended sources."}
{"text":"This work presents the absolute calibration and characterization of the Multiband Imaging Photometer for Spitzer (MIPS) 70 micron modes, based on over two and a half years of observation. In order to attain precise photometry (particularly for faint sources), two additional steps after the standard data reduction are required to remove long-term detector fluctuations. Point spread function fitting is discovered to provide more accurate flux densities than aperture photometry. The calibration amounts to 702 +\/- 35 MJy sr^-1 MIPS70^-1 (5% variation), 66 stars used for assessment. The photometric consistency is established to be 4.5% from two stars throughout every MIPS mission and includes fluctuation on every time scale studied. The preliminary fine-scale calibration factor is 2894 +\/- 294 MJy sr^-1 MIPS70F^-1 (10% uncertainty) and is dependent on ten stars. The uncertainty in the coarse- and fine-scale calibration factors are mainly due to the 4.5% photometric repeatability and the small sample size, respectively. The 5-sigma, 500s sensitivity of the coarse-scale observations is 6-8 mJy. The results here effectively display the accuracy of MIPS 70 micron measurements and affirm the MIPS 70 micron functioning strategy, preincluding the use of regular stimulator flashes to measure the fluctuating responsivities of the Ge:Ga detectors."}
{"text":"\nA Boolean network model of the regulatory circuit of fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces Pombe) is analyzed. This model, composed solely of the known biochemical interactions, is able to accurately reproduce the sequence of regulatory activities observed in living cells at their various phases of the cell cycle. No additional parameters are needed for the model, apart from the regulatory circuitry structure. It is shown that the biological dynamical sequence is determined by the regulatory network, with G1-phase being the dominant attractor in state-space, and the regulatory order of events being strongly maintained. Furthermore, a comparison of this model with a similar one built for the same type of regulatory circuit in S. Cerevisiae unearths an interesting difference in their logic and behavior. The latter system is mainly driven by receptor signals and dampened externally, while S. Pombe's network displays an auto-active logic and requires external damping."}
{"text":"\nThe researchers of a recent study managed to explain the perplexing behavior of oxygen molecules when they first make contact with the Al(111) surface. By invoking spin-selection rules, these researchers uncovered a non-adiabatic picture of the molecules sticking to the surface. Density-functional theory was used to analyze the potential-energy surface which showed possible barriers to molecule dissociation. This article further explains the details of the utilized approach and addresses any inaccuracies of exchange-correlation functionals. It is concluded from the analysis that slight modifications of the spin-triplet constrained potential-energy surface can have an impact on the lowest kinetic energy portion of the sticking rate."}
{"text":"\nUsing MOST (Microvariability & Oscillations of STars) observations from 2003, 2004, and 2005, this paper presents evidence of a similar differential rotation pattern between Kappa1 Ceti and the Sun. A program called StarSpotz was used to solve for the rate of differential rotation, k, and the equatorial rotation period, P_{EQ}. The analysis revealed a rate of differential rotation (k = 0.090^{+0.006}_{-0.005}) which is less than that of the Sun, but is consistent with the younger age of the star. Furthermore, results from the parallel tempering formalism show an equatorial rotation period of 8.77^{+0.03}_{-0.04} days, smaller than the usually adopted value, implying an age of less than 750 My. These results are then used to explain the range of rotation at a variety of latitudes, as well as to infer a possible permanent magnetic feature at latitudes between 50 and 60 degrees. Using MOST, knowledge of k and P_{EQ} is being gained which can be used to analyze other solar-type stars, helping to build an understanding of dynamo mechanisms and age in solar-type stars."}
{"text":"\nThis article explores the AdS\/CFT dictionary to provide an effective description of dynamical electro-weak symmetry breaking with walking behavior. The minimal model entails two parameters, which are restricted by the requirement for a five-dimensional coupling to be perturbative and conforming to precision electro-weak constraints. This leads to the production of four nearly degenerate spin-1 states with similar quantum numbers to those of the standard model electro-weak gauge bosons. Through the study of pp -> mu mu and pp -> mu nu events, it was found that discovery of these states is possible at the LHC with only 10\/fm of integrated luminosity over a considerable part of the available parameter space with masses up to 4 TeV."}
{"text":"\nWe analyze a sample of spiraling galaxies through 21 cm single-dish and optically obtained long-slit spectra, in order to compare the different estimates of rotational widths. We observe and analyze any connected biases to shape, extent, and disk central brightness when taking into account the different width estimators. By far the Polyex widths provide the best match to HI rotational widths, which are attributed to  their measurements taken at the optical radius, apart of a model fitted to the rotation curve. On the issue of overlapping velocities at the 2.15 disk scale lengths, a bias is noticed due to the fraction of total mass contained within the same radius subsequently decreasing with the surface brightness of the spiralling disk. To reduce any discrepancies between the different estimators, statistical corrections are made depending on the radius of the observed rotation curves, leading to a unified and solid estimate of rotational velocity to be used for the application of disk scaling relation."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate the high-energy limit of noncritical M-theory in 2+1 dimensions, which is a double-scaling limit of a nonrelativistic Fermi liquid on a flat two-dimensional plane. Our analysis is analogous to the \\alpha'\\to\\infty limit of string theory, in which case two-dimensional Type 0A strings were asserted to give rise to AdS_2 with a propagating fermion whose mass is set by the RR flux. Here, we provide evidence that the natural ground state of noncritical M-theory for high energies describes AdS_2\\times S^1, with a massless fermion. A topological extension of conformal Chern-Simons gravity in 2+1 dimensions, coupled to a massless Dirac field, is found to capture the spacetime effective theory in this background. Interestingly, the starting two-dimensional plane is the twistor space associated with the symmetry group of AdS_2\\times S^1, proving that at high energies, noncritical M-theory can be described as a \"Fermi liquid on twistor space\"."}

But, despite providing a good basic understanding, unanswered questions remain. Experiments in the next decade will shed light on the current gaps in our knowledge, and potentially uncover new elements to complete the electroweak theory.

{"text":"This paper investigates the N=4 super Yang-Mills duals to BPS states via a series of reductions of IIB supergravity on S^3, then S^3 x S^1 and then S^3 x S^1 x CP^1. Supersymmetry analysis yields 1\/8, 1\/4 and 1\/2 BPS configurations respectively. To obtain the 1\/8 BPS geometries, the Kahler metric on the six-dimensional base must satisfy a non-linear equation; likewise, the 1\/4 BPS configurations require another non-linear Monge-Ampere type equation on the four-dimensional base. A universal bubbling AdS description of these geometries is provided by ensuring regularity conditions at the boundary. In the 1\/8 BPS case, a five-dimensional smooth, generally disconnected surface must be removed from the base. The AdS_5 x S^5 ground state corresponds to excising the internal, S^5 portion, with other 1\/8 BPS excitations corresponding to deformations, including topology change, of the S^5 or the excision of additional droplets within the base. For 1\/4 BPS configurations, regularity conditions identifies three-dimensional surfaces inside the four-dimensional base, segregating the areas where the S^3 and S^1 shrink to zero size."}
{"text":"\nAn analysis of Swift's observations of GRB 060614 reveals an anomaly, as this long duration burst (102s) behaves like a short GRB. Spectral and temporal parameters from the optical, UV and X-ray afterglow display standard behavior with an achromatic break in the light curve at the same time measured by the VLT in the R-band. Early spectral evidence suggests the passage of the break frequency through the optical\/UV band, while the X-ray afterglow may be a counterpart to the burst extended emission. Average spectral properties, including the initial peak of 300 keV, adhere to the expected Eiso-Ep_rest, Egamma-Ep_rest, and Liso-Ep correlations, providing insight into the GRB 060614 progenitor model."}
{"text":"This article offers a new way of analyzing multipartite entanglement and constructing entanglement measures based on two definitions of multipartite information and an optimization process using classical extensions. Its results are applied towards proving that, regardless of criterion, an upper limit on the amount of multipartite distillable key can be defined. Secondly, it relates this process to similar studies conducted in classical key agreement. In essence, this article focuses on calculating the mutual information between parties once conditioned on the state's extension, then taking the lowest of the values in order to yield a new form of squashed entanglement with additivity for both versions. Additionally, the mixed convex roof of a composite state is used in the optimization process to consider all decompositions of a given density matrix."}
{"text":"\nWe conducted an observational survey of LBGs and LAEs surrounding QSO SDSS J0211-0009 located at z=4.87. The combination of broad- and narrow-band imaging methods uncovered a singular structural difference between the two populations of high-z objects: the LBGs void of Ly-alpha emission lived in a filament-like structure centered on the QSO, while the LAEs resided away from the QSO, within a distance of ~4.5Mpc. Additionally, we discovered a large concentration of LBGs and LAEs in a clustering context after chance encounter, with no obvious strong UV ionizing sources in the region -- such as a QSO or a radio galaxy -- known to exist. Furthermore, we noted that LAEs and LBGs had significantly different spatial distributions in the QSO field, as opposed to the observation of majority correlation in the protocluster field. A slight fall in the number count of LAEs in the QSO field in comparison to the protocluster field was seen under both Ly-alpha and UV continuum flux parameters, which suggests that deadly amounts of UV radiation from the QSO is particularly affecting the low-mass galaxies and resulting in the growth of LBGs. Consequently, the segregation between Lyman break galaxies and Lyman Alpha Emitters can be accounted to either accelerated early galaxy formation in an overdense environment, or local photoionization by the QSO."}
{"text":"\nAnalyzing Ly-alpha emitters (LAEs) from high-redshift regions has the potential to provide strong evidence regarding reionization. In this work, radiative transfer simulations over a 200 Mpc scale were used to account for the effect of patchy reionization on line profiles, luminosity functions, and most importantly, on clustering nature of the emitters. The simulated data indicated that a fully ionized universe (x_i = 1) is more likely compared to a universe with x_i < 0.5 with a greater than 2-sigma confidence level. We also examine the optimal LAE survey configurations to observe signatures of reionization. To gain confirmation of reionization, comparison with Lyman-break and H-alpha surveys in the same field is necessary.\n\nThe results of this study point to an available avenue for the detection of characteristic markers of reionization in existing LAE data. Upcoming programs in the near future will increase the size of the Subaru Deep Field z = 6.6 photometric sample by a factor of five, thus enhancing the accuracy and precision of the determination of the ionized fraction."}
{"text":"\nThrough the hydrodynamical simulations of jet models representative of MWC 560 presented in papers I and II of this series, we have examined the X-ray properties of these jets. In this paper, we assess the total X-ray luminosity and its temporal variability, the spectra, and the spatial distribution of the emission within the models frameworks. Taking into account the radiative cooling of the gas as outlined in the second paper of our series, we investigate the temperature and density maps, and make use of the atomic database ATOMDB to calculate X-ray emissivities. Our results indicate that the model jets produce extended and varying X-ray emission featuring hot and warm components consistent with what is observed from CH Cyg and R Aqr. The simulated X-ray spectra contain similar emission line features as those seen in the spectra of CH Cyg. Inner parts of the pulsed jets show iron line emission matching the 6.4 - 6.7 range, which likely causes the central source in R Aqr. The findings of our research suggest that MWC 560 should be detectable via Chandra or XMM-Newton, and X-ray observations of this system can yield information critical to understanding jets in symbiotic stars."}
{"text":"We explore the hydrodynamic limit of a specific particle system which features degenerate rates, also known as 'kinetically constrained lattice gases'. These models are known to comprise configurations that are 'blocked', unable to evolve under the dynamics. It is more difficult to prove the hydrodynamic limit with the Entropy and Relative Entropy methods due to the presence of such blocked  configurations. We show that when the initial profile is sufficiently smooth and bounded away from 0 and 1, the density profile of this KCLG evolves according to the porous medium equation under a diffusive time scaling. Additionally, we provide a perturbed dynamics achieved by introducing jumps for the Symmetric Simple Exclusion into the model and analyse the magnitude of the equilibrium fluctuations and the size of the spectral gap."}
{"text":"\nBy studying the contributions of the finite-sized, non-spinning and arbitrarily shaped bodies' internal structure to the post-Newtonian equations of motion, we provide evidence in favour of the Strong Equivalence Principle. We redefine the masses to account for the 1PN and 2PN self-gravity terms, thereby demonstrating the cancellation of structure-dependent terms that scale as s^{-1} and s^{-5\/2} when the characteristic size (s) of the bodies is taken to be zero. This can potentially be applied to different strong-field systems, such as neutron stars and black holes, and extends earlier works done by Kopeikin."}
{"text":"\nWe demonstrate a fascinating connection between two problems: (a) minimizing the probability of financial ruin when there is stochastic expenditure alongside the opportunity to invest in the Black-Scholes market; and (b) an optimization challenge involving a controller and stopper, whereby the controller adjusts the drift and volatility of a process to encourage an ongoing reward and the stopper decides when to terminate that reward and reward the controller with a final payment. Our focus is to verify that the minimal probability of ruin - with a stochastic representation that does not have a conventional form such as the utility maximization issue (i.e., the objective's reliance on the starting values of the state variables is implicit) - is the only classical response to its Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation, which is a non-linear boundary-value problem. To do this, we utilize the convex duality relationship between (a) and (b)."}
{"text":"\nRecent spectroscopy of the peculiar Type Ib SN 2006jc reveals evidence that dust grains were formed in its aftermath. Our proposed explanation is that the SN blast wave crashing against the LBV-like shell expelled from the progenitor two years before, caused the formation of dust. This is strongly attested to by (a) the red\/near-IR continuum that can be fitted by the presence of 1600 K graphite grains, and (b) progressive asymmetry in He I emission lines as the receding material gets obscured by the shroud of dust. This is the first convincing proof of dust formation in any SN Ib\/c less than a hundred days after peak. Our calculations point to dust formation having taken place in the space between the forward and reverse shocks, where the swept-up shell is denser, rather than in the freely expanding SN ejecta. This is further supported by He I line ratios, He II 4686 emission, and increased X-ray radiation detected during the brief interval of dust formation. Ultimately, the uniqueness of the dust formation event in SN 2006jc can be attributed to the anomalous conditions in the environment at the time of the SN, brought about by the intense LBV-like eruption of its progenitor."}
{"text":"\nWe used the 24 micron camera on the Spitzer Space Telescope to analyze 34 comets on their respective orbits, with the intention of examining debris trails caused by mm-sized particles or larger. 27 comets had trails of this kind, 4 had small-particle dust tails, and only 3 lacked any debris trails despite satisfactory observing conditions. This study has now identified 30 Jupiter-family comets with known debris trails, 22 of them for the first time. Our detection rate was >80%, suggesting that debris trails are a typical occurrence for short-period comets. Particle size calculations of 2-year-old ejecta placed the average particles in 4 of these trails in the mm range, while the remainder are larger. The lower-mass limits of these trails are approx. 10^11 g and the median mass-loss rate is estimated to be 2 kg\/s. This is in line with the OH production rate, but greater than the visible-light scattering estimates for comae."}
{"text":"\nWe analyze all the X-ray timing info for 1E 1207.4-5209 located in SNR PKS 1209-51\/52 acquired during 2000-2005 and observe a constant rotational period of 424.130451(4) ms plus a period derivative of (9.6 +\/- 9.4)E-17 s\/s. This contradicts past assumptions of large changes in the data. The dipole spin-down theory indicates an energy loss rate of below 1.5E32 ergs\/s, a surface field strength of B_p < 3.5E11 G, and a characeteristic age of tau > 24 Myr, significantly higher than the age of the remnant. This means the pulsar was born spinning slowly. The recorded bolometric X-ray luminosity of 2E33 ergs\/s suggests the source of the power is from residual cooling, possibly in part due to debris from the supernova. The upper limit on B_p is small enough to support the electron cyclotron model for one of the dominant absorption lines in its X-ray spectrum. This is the second substantial instance of a weakly magnetized neutron star detected at birth, with the first being PSR J1852+0040 in Kesteven 79."}
{"text":"This article examines the impact of noise-added feedback on the security of the wiretap channel. Previously, a noiseless public discussion channel was used to convey feedback, however in this model, feed-forward and feedback signals traverse through the same noisy channel. Results show that the feedback, when artfully utilized, can increase the perfect secrecy capacity of the channel up to the source-destination channel's capacity, void of a wiretapper. This article also introduces a unique half-duplex feedback technique which can achieve a positive perfect secrecy rate, even when the source-wiretapper channel holds lower noise than the source-destination one. Exploiting the modulo-additive property of the channel, the destination uses encryption over the channel, while confidentializing the key. Afterwards, this scheme is applied to the real valued modulo-$\\Lambda$ channel, whose perfect secrecy capacity with feedback is determined to be identical to the capacity without the wiretapper."}
{"text":"\nIn this study, the scaling behaviors of graphene nanoribbon (GNR) Schottky barrier field-effect transistors (SBFETs) are analyzed using the non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) transport equation in a three-dimensional Poisson equation with an atomistic basis set. Results show that the current-voltage characteristics of GNR FETs is ambipolar in nature and highly reliant on the GNR width since the bandgap of GNRs is inversely proportional to its width, which is in accordance with experiments. In comparison to conventional Si MOSFETs, application of multiple gate geometry for GNFETs reduces short channel effects, but does not have a significant demonstration on the on-current and transconductance. Lowering the oxide thickness turns out to be more practical for improving transistor performance above using a high-k gate insulator. With shrinking channel length below 10nm indicate a steep increase in leakage current due to the low effective mass facilitating source-drain tunneling. As such, GNRFET does not offer an increase of the ultimate scaling limit for Si MOSFETs. However, it does hold intrinsic specs for faster switching speed, which could potentially lead to promising high performance electronics devices despite its large leakage current."}
{"text":"\nThis paper explores the effects of nonlinearity on quantum tunneling and formation of collective excitations in a matter-wave interferometer generated by the conversion of a double-well potential into a single-well harmonic trap. Compared to linear quantum tunneling caused by the encounter (or avoidance) of neighbouring energy levels, quantum tunneling between alternate nonlinear eigenstates is supported by the nonlinear mean-field force. When the division between the wells is decreased, the mean-field connection helps quantum tunneling between the ground and excited nonlinear eigenstates. The subsequent {\\em non-adiabatic evolution} depends on pre-defined input states. The tunneling procedure leads to the creation of dark solitons and the amount of dark solitons created is extremely responsive to the nonlinearity of the matter-wave. These theoretical computations are backed up by a coupled-mode theory for multiple nonlinear eigenstates."}
{"text":"\nIn this paper, we explore the relationship between chaotic mixing and transport of passive particles in a meandering jet flow, as first studied and described in [Prants, et al, Chaos {\\bf 16}, 033117 (2006)], with respect to dynamical, topological, and statistical properties. We explain our findings phenomenologically utilizing dynamical traps or singular zones in the phase space where particles may spend an arbitrary amount of time but is bounded by a finite limit [Zaslavsky, Phys. D {\\bf 168--169}, 292 (2002)]. The transport of passive particles is discussed through measuring the lengths and durations of zonal flights, which occurs when there is a successive switch of the zonal velocity's sign. We reason that certain features of the probability density functions for shorter flights are due to the rotational-islands traps situated at the resonant-islands' border (including the vortex core) which keep the particles in the same frame. Additionally, the statistics of longer flights can be attributed to the influence of the ballistic-islands traps, holding the particles responsible for moving from one frame to another."}
{"text":"This article describes a theoretical exploration of how temporal and diffraction effects influence entanglement creation between two atoms located within a single-mode optical cavity. We examine how the degree of entanglement and its formation time vary depending on the initial conditions and the position of the atoms in the cavity mode. Approximating the cavity as two coupled, driven qubits, we determine that unequal coupling constants can promote transient entanglement over longer timescales than would otherwise be the case. Further, the behavior of the entanglement manifests a diffraction pattern due to the atoms being situated between nodes and antinodes, which signifies a quantum property of complementarity and is evident in the perceived energy of the exchanged photon versus evolution time of the system."}
{"text":"\nThis paper explores the effectiveness of an infrared cloud monitor for the MAGNUM robotic telescope at the Haleakala observatory in Maui, Hawaii. The system consists of two aspherical mirrors and a thermal imager and offers a complete, panoramic view of the sky at a 10 micron wavelength. Since its installation in 2001, the MAGNUM telescope has been used to study active galactic nuclei with the system ensuring optimal weatherproof and maintenance free conditions. Implementing automated decision-making, the system assesses weather conditions from the images it captures and decides if and when the dome should open. According to statistics from four years of operation, the system has recorded 50-60% photometric nights and 75% of nights were found to be suitable for observation. The infrared cloud monitor has now been widely adopted across the world, most notably at observatories in Mauna Kea, Atacama, Okayama and Kiso."}
{"text":"\nIn this paper, we examine the connections between star-forming galaxies, AGN host galaxies, and typical early-type galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR5 and DR4plus datasets. We categorized the spectral types of our chosen early-type galaxies into normal, star-forming, Seyfert, and LINER classes based on various spectral line flux ratios. We then investigated the slope in the fundamental space of each class of early-types in order to observe any distinctions in the slopes of the fundamental planes (FPs) between the various classes. We found that there are clear differences in the FPs among the various subclasses of early-type galaxies, in which the slopes of Seyferts and star-forming galaxies were flatter than those of normal galaxiess and LINERs. This marks the first detection of systematic variations of the FP slopes among subclasses of early-type galaxies. The differing FP slopes may be linked to discrepancies in the amount of nonhomology among distinct classes, or to contrasts in gas contents in their progenitor mergers. One potential explanation is that AGN host galaxies and star-forming galaxies developed from gas-rich mergers and may subsequently evolve into normal early-type galaxies when their star formation or AGN activity been concluded."}
{"text":"The cosmological energy density of the present day universe is likely to be dominated by a slowly rolling scalar field, which leads to a breaking of quantum field theory symmetries. We demonstrate this process as 'cosmological symmetry breaking', distinct from the usual spontaneous symmetry breaking. To illustrate our discussion, we consider a scalar field theory with a U(1) symmetry. We identify a 'pseudo-scale invariance' symmetry, which when broken cosmologically, produces a non-zero vacuum or dark energy. Further applying the slow roll condition, we obtain a value of the background field of the order of Planck mass. We also explore a U(1) gauge symmetry model and demonstrate how cosmological symmetry breaking results in a non-zero mass for the vector field. We illustrate how a broken pseudo-scale invariance can generate a wide range of masses."}

{"text":"\nThe purpose of this article is to explore the relationship between active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and clusters of galaxies as seen in X-ray observations. We measure the soft X-ray cross-correlation function in redshift space using the ROSAT-NEP survey data, which covers an area of 9x9 degrees around the North Ecliptic Pole. We find a > 3 sigma significant clustering signal on scales up to 50 h70-1 Mpc, determining a correlation length of 8.7+1.2-0.3 h_70-1 Mpc and a slope of gamma=1.7$^+0.2_-0.7$. These results provide evidence that AGNs are a reliable tracer of the large-scale structure of the Universe. We further compare our data with the correlation between X-ray clusters and galaxies and observe, although with high uncertainty, that the bias factor of AGNs is approximately the same as that of galaxies."}
{"text":"This article is a compilation of various results and formulas from multiple authors on the areas of five related processes. These processes include Brownian motion, bridge, excursion, meander and double meander. We examine the integral of the absolute value and the integral of the positive (or negative) part for those processes that take both positive and negative values. Through this, we investigate the positive random variables that arise, particularly exploring the formulas for moments and Laplace transforms. Additionally, we provide series representations and asymptotics for density functions and distribution functions. Additionally, we observe Wright's constants appearing in the analysis of connected graphs, as they are connected to the moments of the Brownian excursion area. The main purpose of this survey is to compare the results presented for these seven Brownian areas, paying attention to both the similarities and differences. We look at the Airy function and its different ways of appearing in the formulas for each random variable. Moreover, explicit relations between similar notations and definitions used by various authors are also discussed. This article also offers new results to fill any gaps found in the literature, as well as short proofs. Most proofs, however, are overlooked and the reader is prompted to look in the original sources."}

There has been a convergence of the two sides in support of projects to analyze Dark Energy, however this can be detrimental to the future of astronomy. The distinct methodologies and cultures of each field should be respected and understood so that unnecessary resources are not allocated to the wrong areas and astronomy can remain a viable science. It is not to say that Dark Energy is not a worthwhile pursuit, but rather that one should consider the many other areas within astronomy that may be better suited for research."}
{"text":"\nThe results of an XMM-Newton survey of the COSMOS field, measuring X-ray source counts, are presented in this article. This survey covers a ~2 deg^2 region of the sky over a total integration time of 504 ks and identified a total of 1390 sources. A Monte Carlo simulation was used to construct the logN-logS relations in the 0.5-2, 2-10 and 5-10 keV energy bands, with corresponding flux limits of 7.2x10^-16, 4.0x10^-15, and 9.7x10^-15 erg cm^-2 s^-1, respectively. The resulting counts were found to be consistent with previous X-ray surveys and the latest X-ray background modeling. The discrepancy between the source counts in COSMOS and those in the previously conducted surveys is likely the result of the combination of low-counting statistics and effects of cosmic variance."}
{"text":"This article investigates the impact of changes in the solar chemical composition, most notably a reduction in C, N, and O and an increase of neon abundance, on low degree p-mode and g-mode oscillations. These two types of frequency are strong constraints for models that aim to accurately describe the solar core. GOLF instrument observations of solar frequencies are used to compare solar models with different chemical compositions, including the normalized small frequency spacings in the low degree p-mode frequency range. Results indicate that small frequency spacings are highly sensitive to the changes in heavy-element abundances, particularly neon. The authors also show that with slight adjustments to the solar age and highest abundances, a large increase of the neon abundance by 0.5 +\/- 0.05dex could be a possible solution to the discrepancy between models using new abundances and helioseismological constraints. Additionally, changes in solar abundances, most notably neon, have substantial effects on g-mode frequencies, with relative frequency differences between the old and new models being higher than 1.5%."}

We analyze the complexity of defeating these protocols by estimating a human adversary's workload, proposing a new construction based on text CAPTCHAs, experimenting with real human participants to identify the number of possible attributes, and determining the correlation between the secrets. Our findings suggest that we can construct these protocols, based on image processing, with security guarantees according to our models."}
{"text":"\nThis research provides an updated definition for the quark condensate, a value used to characterize the non-perturbative component of the massive quark. Instead of considering a single, non-positive-definite solution to the Schwinger Dyson equation, a third class of solutions was studied. The results from this analysis showed a range of possible condensates. With the use of the Operator Product Expansion, one can accurately select the physical condensate associated with current quark masses varying from 0 to 25 MeV. Through this process, it was found that the condensate related to mass quarks increases from the chiral limit in a variety of models of strong-interacting QCD. Lastly, the fourth class of noded solutions was explored."}
{"text":"\nIn this study, we have surveyed mid-infrared gas-phase lines in 76 circumstellar disks of low-mass pre-main sequence stars as part of the Spitzer \"Cores to Disks\" program. This is the first detection of [Ne II] and [Fe I] in ~20% and ~9% of these systems, respectively. The [Ne II] line emission suggests that these disks are x-ray-irradiated and the [Fe I] fluxes imply the presence of gas-rich disks with masses > 0.1 M_J. Additionally, H_2 0-0 S(2) and S(3) lines were detected from a few sources at much higher intensities than predicted by current disk models. To explain this emission, we suggest the presence of interceding shocks from a stellar wind is required and cannot be explained by the non-detections of [S I] and [Fe II] lines."}

The QEG algorithm is capable of constructing an analog of a Quasi Equilibrium Manifold (QEM) in any dimension. It is based on the notion of Slow Invariant Manifold (SIM) which is a fundamental concept in chemical kinetics and is used to reduce models. A Spectral Quasi Equilibrium Manifold (SQEM) is typically applied to obtain an initial approximation of this manifold. The QEG is found by refining an initial grid and subsequently detecting an invariant grid to describe the SIM. The results of application of the QEG algorithm to the model hydrogen oxidation reaction in one and two-dimensions are presented here. The QEG method is ascertained to be valid for convex functions subjected to linear constraints."}
{"text":"\nUsing the full-potential linearized augmented plane wave method, an examination of the bandstructure of $\\alpha-LiIO_{3}$ crystal was conducted in order to gain more insight into the SHG (second harmonic generation) of this material. Through this investigation, it was revealed that the non-inversion symmetry of the crystal has led to the emergence of finite intra-band momentum matrix elements. Additionally, the strong covalent bond between the iodine atoms and the ligand oxygen atoms is what allows for the double resonance condition to be met. Further elucidating the SHG process, an inter-band transition in the nano-structure of $\\alpha-LiIO_{3}$ was proposed. The optical properties of this crystal were then evaluated through the theoretical framework of time-dependent perturbation of independent particle model, resulting in the calculation of the dielectric tensors, refractive index, and x-ray near edge absorption spectra. A comparison between the results and the predictions were then made and possible sources of errors were examined."}
{"text":"\nObservations from millimeter interferometry of pre-main-sequence stars' disks reveal the existence of pebble-sized particles, ranging in size from millimeters to centimeters, which are estimated to remain in the outer parts of these disks for up to 10 million years. This survival rate goes against the predictions of theoretical models of radial drift, which suggest that such particles should drift inwardly within 0.1 million years. This conflict is investigated through advanced theoretical models, incorporating sedimentation, collective drag forces, and turbulent viscosity. It is found that, despite slowing the radial drift somewhat, this alone is not enough to explain the discrepancy between estimates. However, if the gas to dust ratio of the disk was reduced by a factor of 20 (e.g. through photoevaporation), the radial drift time frames become compatible with observations."}
{"text":"\nWe explore how individuals interact in the context of binary choices, with the presence of positive additive externalities. We extend known results to the study of Idiosyncratic Willingnesses to Pay (IWP), a general distribution of preferences. The result is a newly developed family of inverse demand curves, including decreasing slopes as well as non-uniform convexity. When the social influence effect is small relative to the standard deviation of the IWP distribution, inverse demand will normally be monotone. However, once the social influence surpasses a certain threshold, the inverse demand may become non-monotone within an intermediate rate of adoption, increasing or decreasing with the rate of adoption. Furthermore, the generic properties depending on the modality, smoothness and support of the IWP distribution allow for a precise delineation of the regions of multiple equilibria. We summarized the principal results in a phase diagram."}
{"text":"\nIn this study, we analyse the possibility of measuring sulphur abundance (A(S)) from the near-infrared triplet of Silicon (SI) at 1045 nm. Unlike Silicon and Calcium, sulphur does not form dust, which results in an increased scatter of sulphur-to-iron ratios seen in observations of low metallicities or a bimodal distribution seen in some stars. Given that the lines of Multiplet 1 at 920 nm are affected by telluric lines when observed from the ground, Multiplet 3 at 1045 nm, which is located in a range that is clear from such contamination, is considered here. Our sample is composed of the Sun (G2V), Procyon (F5V), HD 33256 (F5V), HD 25069 (G9V) and epsilon Eri (HD 22049, K2V). For the Sun and Procyon, the analysis is conducted with CO5BOLD 3D hydrodynamical model atmospheres, while for the other three stars, 1D models are employed. Ultimately, we discover that the infrared lines of Mult.3 are a reliable instrument of A(S) measurement and can be useful in analysing the evolution of [S\/Fe] at low metallicities."}
{"text":"\nOur aim is to investigate the variation in Lithium abundances in turn off stars within the Globular Cluster 47 Tuc. To achieve this, we made use of high resolution spectra obtained from the 8.2m VLT Kueyen telescope. Our results showed a range of 1.6 - 2.3 in terms of Li abundances, with a standard deviation of 0.25 dex. When compared to other two turn off stars' data of the cluster available in literature, the Li abundance variation observed is at least 0.6 dex. Additionally, an anti-correlation between the Lithium and Sodium abundances was observed, similar to that found in NGC 6752, which could be attributed to the p captures on 22Ne at temperatures higher than 3x10^7 K. The observed lack of correlation between Nitrogen and Lithium abundances, along with the low N\/O ratios of the sample stars, suggests that the Li production and Na destruction occured in a previous generation of stars. Our results further instill that the Globular Clusters have different abundance patterns than expected."}
{"text":"\nWe explore the challenges of predicting the solar cycle by means of mean-field models. Our analysis suggests that these difficulties are caused by the modifications in pattern of the solar activity cycle due to either random or deterministic factors. To test this conjecture, we consider two separate solar dynamo models. In the first one, we account for random perturbations to the flux transport dynamo, which generate obvious disparities in activity cycle, consequently diminishing predictability. The other model is based on the premise that the formation of the solar magnetic field can be expressed using a deterministic nonlinear mean-field model. This model provides a more perfect setting to determine the prospects of forecast. By using the output of this deterministic model with specially chosen parameters, we investigate the limitations of both long- and short-term prediction of the solar cycle. Surprisingly, even if an exact replica of the original model is used for forecast, long-term prediction is not possible. Also, even if the forecasting model is adjusted to copy the output of former cycles, short-term prediction is still not achievable if the inputs of the model vary slightly from the reference model. Considering the inherent uncertainty of mean-field models to calculate the transport coefficients and nonlinear responses, it seems that predicting the solar cycle with their output is a vain endeavor."}
{"text":"\nThis project seeks to explore the physics behind the observed accelerated expansion of the universe by studying the changing cosmological redshift of distant sources over time. With the help of ultra-stable and high-resolution spectrographs coupled to extremely large telescopes such as the ELT, future observation and analysis of the time-variant cosmological redshift could provide valuable insight into the nature of dark energy. Through use of a Fisher matrix analysis, this study looks at the possibility of constraining dark energy models with the time-varying cosmological redshift data, as well as discriminating between different models. The findings indicate that despite parameter degeneracies, assumptions of additional outside information could aide in narrowing the uncertainties of parameter reconstruction. Together with other cosmological tools, this method could serve as a useful secondary tool to better understand the dynamics of dark energy."}
{"text":"\nIn this paper, we investigate the scaling laws of a cognitive network with n simultaneous pairs of cognitive transmitters and receivers in the presence of multiple primary users. Specifically, we consider how the network throughput, as well as the radius of a primary exclusive region outside of which cognitive users can avoid causing interference, vary with the number of cognitive users. We analyze two scenarios, with either a static or a scaled power, and show that, with a path-loss larger than 2, the throughput scales linearly and can be guaranteed with a minimum distance to primary users at a given outage constraint. The results suggest that single-hop transmission can be used to provide an efficient and feasible means of secondary spectrum access."}

Our research demonstrates that the minigap present in the spectrum of a diffusive wire is extremely receptive to interface transmission, which serves as the determinant for the temperature dependence of the critical current instead of the Thouless energy. In addition, we analyze the reduction of the critical current by spin-flip scattering, involving either magnetic impurities or a possible external magnetic field. Statistical interpretations of experiments and theoretical predictions can be further explored with our study based on the quasiclassical theory of diffusive superconductors."}

{"text":"\nThis paper examines how power control algorithms can be modified to effectively manage wireless cellular networks with CDMA technology. Research demonstrates that, in large CDMA systems, power control algorithms need only minimal knowledge about the signal of interest and the multiaccess interference to be successful. To study uplink CDMA systems, linear and non-linear MMSE receivers with serial interference cancellation receivers were utilized. Analysis reveals that, in large systems, effective power control algorithms can be implemented without extensive prior knowledge of the user. The performance of the distributed algorithms and the power profile are in agreement with the conventional algorithms which require more information."}
{"text":"This article provides a Fundamental-measure functional specifically designed for the model of aligned hard hexagons, while also investigating the structure of fundamental measure theory. We derive the functional by projecting aligned hard cubes onto the plane x+y+z=0, and observe that it lacks the \"lost cases\" configurations of pairwise overlap but no triple overlap. A unique feature of the functional for aligned hexagons is the presence of a new, uniparametric term which distinctively separates it from the hard disks model. The implications of this are explored and discussed, in addition to a study of the systems' freezing behavior."}
{"text":"\nThis article examines the power control and receiver design problem in a wireless data network with the goal of optimizing energy efficiency. The joint multiuser detection and power control approach is carried out via the game-theoretical approach outlined by Meshkati. System asynchronism, the use of band-limited chip pulses, and the multipath distortion from the wireless channel are all accounted for in this analysis. Turing to power control specifically, several non-cooperative games are proposed for users to maximize their efficacy, measured as the ratio of data throughput against transmit power. Beginning with linear multiuser detectors, then transitioning to non-linear decision feedback detectors, the proposed games are shown to yield a singular Nash equilibrium point. Simulation results validate the proposed solutions, while also highlighting the vast improvements achieved with the decision feedback receivers."}
{"text":"This study investigates the ground-state energies of a five-quark system composed of a heavy-light K-Lambda configuration using lattice QCD. The potential created by the energies of this system, Va(r), is then utilized to probe its structure. The simulation is based on an anisotropic and asymmetric lattice with Wilson fermions. Employing the maximum entropy method, energies are extracted from corresponding spectral density functions. Our results propose the ground state of this 5-quark system resembles a hadronic molecule, while the first excited state is more likely to be a pentaquark cluster. We postulate that light-quark pentaquarks may not be found in nature, but they may exist in an excited form within the heavy-quark sector."}
{"text":"\nIn this article, we introduce a new notion of information density, called 'Bounded Pushdown (BPD) dimension', which considers a finite-state machine with an infinite stack of memory and a restriction that each input symbol is allowed only a restricted number of stack movements. We prove that BPD dimension is a robust measure of information density. Furthermore, we explore and establish the differences between BPD compression and the well-known Lempel-Ziv (LZ) technique. We exemplify this by showing how a BPD compressor can compress a sequence that LZ fails to compress significantly, with a factor of at least 2. We also demonstrate a significant separation between the finite-state and BPD dimensions."}
{"text":"\nThis paper investigates the impacts of macroclumping on the mass-loss rate of massive stars. Present models do not adequately account for the inhomogeneity of stellar winds, which can lead to underestimating the empirical mass-loss rate by factors of two or more. We use the Potsdam Wolf-Rayet model atmosphere code to account for clumps that are not necessarily optically thin. We find that optically thick clumps reduce the effective opacity, resulting in a pronounced effect on the emergent spectrum. Modeling of an O-type supergiant reveals that optically thin H-alpha lines are unaffected by macroclumping, while the strengths of optically thick lines are reduced. Our findings resolve the discrepancies between resonance-line and recombination-line diagnostics. Our results indicate that neglecting the porosity of hot-star winds can lead to the underestimation of empirical mass-loss rates, and should be considered when modeling stellar atmospheres for mass-loss determinations."}
{"text":"\nBy examining a larger sample of polar Broad Absorption Line Quasars (BALQSOs) from the SDSS DR5, this paper aims to provide an explantion to the underlying physical nature of these celestial bodies. The argument put forward by Zhou et al, based on the radio variability of some BALQSOs, was that these objects are viewed in a polar orientation relative to their accretion disks. This paper verifies the calculation of brightness temperature, $T_{b}$, made by Zhou et al., and then extends this knowledge to an entire sample of polar BALQSOs. In doing so, we observe an exaggerated number of LoBALQSOs (low ionization BALQSOs) in this group. This is seen as a key piece of evidence to understanding the nature of polar BALQSOs, as it supports the prediction of polar BALQSO analytical and numerical models put forward by Punsly, where LoBALQSOs tend to present in environments where the line of sight is close to the polar axis and the outflow density is high."}
{"text":"\nWe complete our quest of single-site observations of pulsating subdwarf B stars and provide the findings of our rigorous times series photometry of HS 0039+4302 and HS 0444+0458 at the MDM Observatory in the autumn of 2005. We upgraded the number of detected frequencies for HS 0039+4302 from 4 to 14 and uncovered one other frequency for HS 0444+0458, making it a total of three. A collection of tests were then executed to trace out potential multiplet structure, inspect changes in amplitudes, and evaluate frequency density to constrain the mode degree $\\ell$.\n\nOnce we incorporate these two stars, 23 different pulsating sdB stars have been assessed with follow-up observations aimed to unlock their pulsation spectra. We evaluated the detected frequency content in terms of variability and diversity, alongside the amplitudes to understand their correlations with the suggested $\\kappa$ pulsation mechanism and other hypotheses."}
{"text":"\nThis study employs a multilevel method to investigate and quantify the intricate links between the molecular characteristics and in vivo behaviour of looped DNA-protein complexes. Utilising the repressor protein Lac as a model, we observe and calculate properties such as the presence of two different configurations, stabilisation of one of the forms by architectural DNA-binding proteins, and the elastometric constants and bending energies. We use these findings to construct predictive models of gene regulation, which highlight the incredible versatility of looped complexes in regulating genetic expression."}
{"text":"We consider an impulsive solar flare that exhibited weak X-ray and EUV emission, with strong emission in the radio spectrum. To observe the flare, observed data from the Nobeyama Radioheliograph (NoRH), Nobeyama Radio Polarimeters (NoRP), and Owens Valley Solar Array (OVSA) in the radio spectrum was used, as well as data from TRACE, GOES, and Yohkoh for EUV and X-ray bands. We show that radio emission onset lagged behind hard X-ray emission onset, while radio flux density maximum demonstrated a reverse trend with decreasing frequency. The decay of the radio emission showed no dependence on frequency. The data showed that gyrosynchrotron radiation from MeV-energy electrons in a dense?thermal plasma can explain the observed radio emission. This allowed us to identify possible mechanisms of plasma heating and acceleration of electrons, positing that stochastic acceleration likely plays a role."}
{"text":"\nWe conducted a study utilizing the capabilities of the Keck Observatory's laser guide star adaptive optics (LGS-AO) system and the Chandra X-ray Observatory in order to observe and analyze the intriguing radio and optical nebula G70.7+1.2. We were able to detect a hard, low luminosity X-ray source within the context of the nebula, as well as a brighter near-infrared counterpart that had colors and brightness values that are typical of heavily obscured B-stars or perhaps late-G\/early-K giants. We hypothesized that this new X-ray source is likely to be an unrelated non-accreting B-star\/pulsar binary, and that its interaction with a dense molecular cloud is what created G70.7+1.2. Our findings make a strong case that this is the true source of G70.7+1.2, and breaks with previous theories regarding the Be-star as its dominant energy source."}
{"text":"This paper presents a novel Fundamental Plane relationship between the observed properties of Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) clusters, specifically their size, thermal energy, and mass. Through the use of a semi-analytical model of the intracluster gas, the errors related to the mass-flux relationship were found to be reducible by 34%. These findings demonstrate that when combined with additional understanding of the influence of non-gravitational heating on the outskirts of the intracluster medium, the Fundamental Plane relationship can be a decisive factor in improving the accuracy of cosmological measurements deriving from SZ clusters."}
{"text":"\nThe analysis of the intrinsic spectral index distribution (ISID) of gamma-ray-emitting blazars is relevant in assessing the shape of the diffuse extragalactic gamma-ray background and helping to understand blazar emission mechanisms. Here, we introduce a maximum-likelihood framework to explore the ISID of EGRET blazars, finding a mean of 2.27 and standard deviation of 0.20. We also investigate if there are separate ISIDs of Flat-Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQs) and BL Lac objects (with BL Lacs being harder). Furthermore, we search for any spectral index hardening due to blazar activity and find no evidence of this. Finally, we generate predicted GLAST datasets and analyze them, providing the prospect of much greater accuracy in determining the ISID. GLAST should be able to distinguish between separate ISIDs for BL Lacs and FSRQs, or separate ISIDs in the quiescent and flaring states, at a significance of more than 3\u03c3."}
{"text":"\nWe outline results from an investigation into incorporating more detailed gas physics into semi-analytic models (SAMs) of galaxy formation that emphasizes the effects of the environment. Our main difference from previous SAMs lies in the addition of 'gravitational' heating of the intra-cluster medium (ICM) via gas stripped from infalling satellites. Gravitational heating proves to be a strong and effective form of heating, preventing cooling in dark matter halos greater than a mass of $\\sim 10^{13}$ M$_{\\odot}$. Furthermore, the energy released from gravitational heating can even surpass the energy generated by AGN-feedback in the most massive galaxies. However, the two processes differ in their time and mass dependence, with gravitational heating making its strongest contribution at late times, when the activity of AGN feedback is beginning to wane, thereby reproducing the trend of downsizing in the star formation rate of massive galaxies."}
{"text":"This paper examines the age-metallicity relation in the local disk, the age distribution of nearby FGK dwarfs, and the implications of the results for designing searches for Earth-analogues. Using the Hipparcos catalogue and Valenti & Fischer (2005) dataset, the study finds evidence of age-metallicity relation with increasing mean metallicity with time. The age distribution of FGK dwarfs which is supplemented with literature data indicates a consistent star-formation rate over the history of the Galactic disk. However, stars with planetary companions within 0.4 AU demonstrate a flattening of age distribution, which suggests that such systems are stable over long timescales. Finally, the analysis suggests that if there is a correlation between stellar metallicity and the frequency of terrestrial planets, the median age of such planetary system is likely to be around 3 Gyrs."}
{"text":"\nThis paper demonstrates that the observables of bursting neutron stars can be determined in metric theories of gravity without the requirement of the general relativistic field equations. In particular, the redshift of a surface atomic line and touchdown luminosity of a radius-expansion burst, believed to be based on the Eddington critical luminosity, are calculated. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the apparent surface area of a neutron star, observed during cooling tails of a burst, depends on a coordinate radius and gravitational redshift in the same way as occur in general relativity. Additionally, Eddington critical luminosity is based on a parameter that evaluates satisfaction of the general relativistic field equations. This information can be applied in conjunction with future high-energy observation of bursting neutron stars to make a determination of the applicability of general relativity in the strong-field regime."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate the behaviour of trapping vortices in the junctions of Bose-Josephson\nsystems which have been suddenly connected. We study this by designing a semiclassical\nmodel consisting of independently evolved $N$ BECs which are coupled together in\nloops by Josephson junctions and a dissipative term. This model is then used to calculate\nthe probability of having a vortex of winding number $m$ present in the final state.\nOur simulations suggest that the final winding numbers are more restricted than the\ninitial total phases, making an absence of vortices more likely. Counter-intuitively,\nnon-zero circulation can occur even when the initial total phase is zero. Furthermore,\nthe width of the final distribution of winding numbers appears to scale as $\\lambda N^{\\alpha}$\nwith $\\alpha=0.47\\pm 0.01$ and $\\lambda <0.67$ (the predicted value of the initial\ndistribution), showing that the sizes of the distribution tend to shrink. It was observed\nthat the value of $\\lambda$ is dependent on the strength of the dissipation."}
{"text":"\nThis article provides an overview of the asymmetrical profiles of different spectral lines seen in solar flares, as well as the modelings used to explain them. These line shifts can be attributed to vertical mass motions inside the flaring layers, making them a prime candiate to measure plasma flow during a solar flare. While attempts have been made using the bisector technique, most results are not reliable under certain conditions and therefore a non-LTE technique is used to calculate synthetic line profiles that correspond to flaring atmosphere. This article will include an overview on different observations of line asymmetries in chromospheric flares, and discuss data on chromospheric evaporation as well as reconnection models. A critical review of the classical methods for calculating Doppler shifts for optically thick chromospheric lines will be done, with details on the new approach being presented."}
{"text":"\nA molecular dynamics investigation was conducted to examine the spatial\nscope of low energy excitations (LEE) in a single linear chain of combined atoms.

{"text":"\nWe present a comprehensive analysis of multi-color photometry of the Galactic globular cluster (GC) M75, with a focus on the brighter sequences of the color-magnitude diagram (CMD) in U-based CMD. We use our own photometric data on GCs of [Fe\/H]zw<-1.1 dex observed with different equipment, as well as present the new photometry results of M75. We demonstrate that Delta U_{TO}^{BHB} - the difference in U magnitude between the Turnoff point and the level of the blue Horizontal Branch near its red boundary - is about 0.4-0.5 mag smaller when observed with the EMMI camera of the NTT\/ESO telescope than when observed with the 100\" telescope and 1.3 m Warsaw telescope of the Las Campanas Observatory. We also show, for the first time, the dependence between metallicity of the cluster and the parameter DeltaU_{TO}^{RGB}, the difference in U magnitude between the TO and RGB inflection points, with a slope of 1.2 mag\/dex. Additionally, the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) clump and features of the RGB luminosity function (LF) of M75 are discussed."}
{"text":"This paper presents a multi-stage, data-driven approach to investigate and measure supermassive binary black-hole systems in data from the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Using the first LISA Mock Data Challenge, the proposed three-stage pipeline combines a time-frequency track search, a matched-filter template bank, and a Markov Chain Monte Carlo search to estimate all nine physical parameters of the binary. Additionally, improved measurement accuracy from the second stage is leveraged to reduce the burn-in time for the Markov Chain process. Future plans to enhance and refine the pipeline for implementation in real LISA analysis are also discussed."}
{"text":"\nThis paper explores the question of how transcription factors (TFs) can rapidly\nlocate their target sequences on a DNA molecule when competing with a vast\nnumber of non-relevant sequences. We employ a Monte Carlo simulation of a\nphysically motivated model wherein a 1D or 2D strip representing the DNA is\npopulated with sites of different affinities, corresponding either to target or\nnon-target sequences. Three different types of molecules are considered: a\nwalker, a jumper and a hopper. Each explores the strip either in 1D or 3D pathways,\nor a combination of the two, searching for the desired sites. Our results suggest\nthat a TF can find its target quickly even when it spends as little as 15% of its\ntime diffusing freely in the solution, which is in agreement with the experimental\nfindings of Elf et al. 2007. Thus, our study provides a valuable insight into the\ntranscription factor binding to DNA."}
{"text":"\nThis work presents the discovery of exoplanets orbiting three intermediate-mass subgiants by precise Doppler measurements of the said stars. The radial velocities of these stars display variations indicative of Keplerian orbits of planetary-mass companions. The planets, with masses of 2.5, 2.0, and 0.61Mjup respectively, are orbiting HD 192699, HD 210702, and HD 175541 at distances of 351.5, 341.1, and 297.3 day, respectively. Through the use of evolutionary models, it is found that these were formerly A-type dwarfs with masses ranging from 1.65-1.85Msun. Investigations further reveal that the missing close-in planets may not be explained by the envelopment of stars in relation to their expanding host stars. Therefore, this work suggests that the observed lack of planets near A-type stars may be due to the different formation and migration histories of the planetary bodies around such stars."}
{"text":"\nWe have conducted a multiwavelength investigation of RX J1117.4+0743 ([VMF 98] 097), a poor cluster at a redshift of 0.485. Using data from GMOS\/Gemini South g' and r' photometry and spectroscopy, as well as XMM-Newton observations, we studied the projected galaxy distribution, the galaxy velocity distribution, the weak-lensing mass reconstruction, and the X-ray imaging and spectroscopy of the cluster. We found that the cluster is composed of at least two structures in the line-of-sight, with velocity dispersions of 592+-82 km s^-1 and 391+-85 km s^-1 respectively. We also detected other clumps at projected distances of around 1 h^-1 Mpc. The temperature and bolometric X-ray luminosity derived from the observations are consistent with predictions for both local (z=0) and moderate redshift (z~0.4) clusters. However, the mass obtained through weak-lensing was substantially higher than that estimated from X-ray measurements, possibly due to the cluster's non-equilibrium state or the presence of unseen intervening mass. Our results show that RX J1117.4+0743 ([VMF 98] 097) is an example of a poor cluster undergoing the buildup of additional substructures to become rich."}
{"text":"\nThis article discusses the results of simulated expansion of an isotropic adiabatic relativistic fireball around a massive GRB progenitor from within its wind-shaped circumburst medium. Utilizing the adaptive mesh refinement versatile advection code, we were able to follow the transition from thermal to ultra-relativistic kinetic explosion. We found that the blastwave passed through a forward and reverse shock pair during interaction with the free stellar wind, ultimately creating a complex shock-governed structure when entering the shocked wind region. Ultimately, we show that the self-similar deceleration found in the Blandford-McKee type can only be produced in the constant density atmosphere of the shocked wind zone in our model."}
{"text":"The concept of diversity is exceedingly ambiguous and rarely given a concrete definition. We explore the various interpretations of diversity in light of prominent ethical and policy issues such as affirmative action and the enrollment of female students and minority students in the disciplines of science and engineering. Our analysis reveals that diversity can be viewed as a factual description, a mistaken desire for symmetry, an opinion of intrinsic good, an instrumental good that can be assessed via empirical data, a symptom of underlying issues, or a side effect. We discuss the implications of each of these elements as well as the example of female enrollment in science and engineering to demonstrate how they might be applied in practical contexts."}
{"text":"This paper examines the role that conservation laws play in evolutionary processes which occur in material systems. It examines how skew-symmetric differential forms, which are used in combination with exterior forms based on differentiable manifolds, can be used to describe such conservation laws. Such evolutionary forms possess a unique property, namely, the transformation of closed exterior forms from them. This enables the disclosure of the connection between physical fields and material systems and also solves many problems in existing field theories. Furthermore, these forms are essential for understanding the process of field generation."}
{"text":"This article examines how network coding can be applied to wireless ad hoc networks at the physical layer, instead of perceiving the signal broadcast as a nuisance. Physical-layer network coding (PNC) takes advantage of the additive properties of electromagnetic (EM) waves in order to provide a coding operation equivalent to a digital bit stream. This scheme can potentially boost throughput by up to 100% in comparison with traditional transmission and 50% over that of straightforward network coding in multi-hop networks. Furthermore, the information-theoretic capacity of PNC is almost twice the level of that of traditional transmission in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) region of practical consideration (above 0 dB). This is believed to be the first paper to explore EM-wave-based network coding at the physical layer and demonstrate its potential for improving network capacity."}
{"text":"\nAt the end of the Pleistocene, Arctic East Siberia underwent a significant change in its latitude due to clues pointing to a large body orbiting the Sun in an extremely eccentric trajectory. This massive object generated heat from tidal work and solar radiation and created a disk-shaped cloud of ions around the Sun, effectively shielding the sunlight to produce periods of extreme cold and warm temperatures characteristic of the Pleistocene. This climate disruption also caused fine-grained particles to be deposited into the ice. Eventually, the massive interloper had a close encounter with the Earth, causing a one-per mil stretching deformation, a shift in the Earth's rotation axis, and ultimately the movement of the North Pole from Greenland to the Arctic Sea. When the deformation returned to equilibrium, the large object was destroyed and evaporated."}
{"text":"In this study, we use the covariant light-front quark model to investigate the form factors of $B_c^-\\to J\/\\psi$ and $B_c^-\\to X(3872)$. With the help of the soft-collinear effective theory, we calculate the exclusive processes $B_c^- \\to J\/\\psi\\pi^-(K^-)$ and $B_c^- \\to X(3872)\\pi^-(K^-)$ and obtain their related branching ratios. The results for $B_c^-\\to J\/\\psi \\pi^-(K^-)$ agree with previous studies and with the identification of X(3872) as a $1^{++}$ state, the corresponding branching ratios are estimated to be $(1.7^{+0.7+0.1+0.4}_{-0.6-0.2-0.4}) \\times 10^{-4}$ and $(1.3^{+0.5+0.1+0.3}_{-0.5-0.2-0.3})\\times 10^{-5}$, respectively. Assuming X(3872) as a $1^{--}$ will lead to higher values of the branching ratios. This work can be used to better understand the nature of X(3872) by testing the charmonium model at the LHCb experiment."}
{"text":"\nThe results of numerical simulations of massive star clusters within the Magellanic Clouds were studied in order to determine whether stellar-mass black holes, formed from the supernova explosions of some of the most massive stars, affect their structural evolution. It was found that if these black holes were retained in the cluster completely, they would rapidly form a dense core and interact heavily, resulting in both black hole scattering into the halo of the cluster and ejection of black holes. The resulting heating of the stellar component would lead to extended core expansion of a size corresponding to observations. We also saw that the early core evolution in the Magellanic Cloud clusters was not due to action of the black holes but is reproducible by the effects of mass-loss from rapid stellar evolution in a mass segregated cluster."}
{"text":"\nThis paper investigates the application of Extended Clifford Algebras in the design of Space-Time Block Coding (STBC) systems that are Maximum Likelihood (ML) decodable. To study this problem, the maximal rate of STBCs is obtained with $\\lambda=2^a$ complex symbols per channel used. Algebasic constructions based on linear representations of finite groups and right module algebras of non-commutative rings are presented and an algebraic basis is provided for the 'ABBA' method and tensor product construction, previously proposed by Tirkkonen et al and Karmakar et al respectively. It is established that a four transmit antenna design described by Tirkkonen et al is a single complex symbol ML decodable system if the configuration of design variables and signal sets is modified accordingly."}
{"text":"\nThis article examines the threshold electrodisintegration of the deuteron at backwards angles, utilizing a relativistic Hamiltonian that incorporates an off-shell one-pion-exchange potential and pseudovector pion-nucleon coupling theory. Centre-of-mass and Breit frames are used for the bound- and scattering-state evaluations, respectively, and retaining the full lorentz structure of the electromagnetic current operator. To establish the size of relativistic effects, the calculations are performed using both non-relativistic phase-equivalent Hamiltonian and current models. The results illustrate that, when taking into consideration just one body currents, relativistic corrections become considerable for higher momentum transfer $Q$. Conversely, when accounting for two-body currents, predictions are seen to be much smaller than non-relativistic results in the $Q^2$ area 18-40 fm$^{-2}$. Additionally, existing discrepancies between the model and experimental data at intermediate momentum transfer are further substantiated."}
{"text":"This article examines the prospect of using the ATLAS detector at the LHC to detect and measure Supersymmetry in the Focus-Point region of mSUGRA models. The expected responses of the detector at different levels of the LHC collected data are examined, including those involving hard jets, high missing energy, and the reconstruction of $b$-tagged jets, opposite-sign isolated electron\/muon pairs, and top quarks. Using 1 ${fb}^{-1}$ of data, each of these signals may enable the observation of events beyond the Standard Model expectations with a statistical significance of at least 5 standard deviations. In addition, an analytical equation for the dilepton invariant mass arising from the 3-body leptonic decay of the neutralinos under the heavy scalar hypothesis is estimated, allowing to fit simulated LHC data and to obtain values for two kinematic endpoints exhibiting the $\\tilde \\chi^0_2 - \\tilde \\chi^0_1$ and $\\tilde \\chi^0_3 - \\tilde \\chi^0_1$ mass differences. This information is used to regulate the MSSM parameter space with the data."}
{"text":"This paper discusses the relationship between bijective and non-degenerate cohomology classes on finite groups as they relate to groups of central type. A non-classical finite group $G$, composed of an abelian group $A$ and a finite group $Q$ via a semidirect product, is of central type if it admits a non-degenerate cohomology class $[c]\\in H^2(G,\\C^*)$. It is known that such groups can be determined from their representation-theoretic properties. Building on Etingof and Gelaki's explicit formula for a non-degenerate 2-cocycle in $Z^2(G,\\C^*)$ given that $Q$ acts on $A$ bijectively, this works presents a more general correspondence between bijective and non-degenerate classes for extensions $1\\to A\\to G\\to Q\\to 1$. This further generalizes the family of central type groups."}
{"text":"\n\nIn this study, we probe the origins of GRB 060912A, a gamma-ray burst of ambiguous duration classification. Long-duration bursts (LGRBs) have been known to have greater energies than short duration bursts (SGRBs), often associated with specific host galaxies of given ages. We explore whether duration is a sufficient predictor of GRB type.  Using the VLT, our deep optical imaging and spectroscopy revealed GRB 060912A originated from a distant star-forming galaxy at redshift 0.937, and  is most likely a long burst. This discovery demonstrates that it is not safe to assume that identifications of galaxies, or other discriminators reliant on redshift, are necessarily good indicators of GRB type without further evidence."}
{"text":"\nThis paper presents a test of 'non-local realism', a theory that maintains the concept of realism but modifies the idea of locality to account for quantum mechanics. Through both theoretical analysis and experiment, we test a set of correlations between entangled photons that violate an inequality proposed by Leggett which opposes non-local realism. The results suggest that it is not enough to give up the concept of locality to be in accordance with quantum experiments; certain features of realism need to be given up too. Our experiment confirms that quantum predictions regarding entangled particles contradict theories based on local realism."}
{"text":"\nBy studying the physical characteristics of the crack tip in moist air, the presence of a dynamic 100 nm liquid condensate has been identified in fused silica glass surfaces during slow crack propagation. Taking this further, in-situ Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) was employed to estimate the sticking forces between the condensate and the glass surface due to the formation of capillary bridges. Additionally, our experiments revealed an increase in condensation length with relative humidity, an effect that was not predicted by the Kelvin equation and believed crack tip geometry."}
{"text":"\nThe results of three-dimensional radiative hydrodynamics simulations of protoplanetary disks show various disparate disk behaviors, producing varying results on the role of convection in cooling, the disk's metal content and its stability against clump formation and fragmentation. To ensure valid outcomes, a radiative physics algorithm is proposed and tested to demonstrate the capacity to produce expected flux and temperature distributions, follow a contracting slab of material and either facilitate or inhibit convection as required. Using the test results, we evaluate two distinct radiative algorithms from Meji\\'a (2004) and Boley et al. (2006), and Cai et al. (2006) and Cai et al. (2007, in prep.), and present a new algorithm combining flux-limited diffusion and vertical rays. We show that the new algorithm produces qualitatively similar results - that convection does not play a major part in cooling and the disk is stable - but with some different quantitative details. This supports an effective $\\alpha\\approx 10^{-2}$ for the disk, with transport mainly dominated by low-order modes."}

These agents communicate with each other, remember and exchange information throughout the system. The key information emerges through an evolutionary dynamic that favors particular connections and amplifies them."}
{"text":"\nWe studied the impact of incorporating different physical models of intracluster medium (ICM) on the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) emission from galaxy clusters. With the help of high-resolution hydrodynamic re-simulations, we explored modifications in the SZ profiles and scaling relations. Additionally, realistic mock observations were used to examine the validity of results from the simulations. It was revealed that SZ clusters' features are largely unaffiliated with ICM physics; on the other hand, dependence on the mass of the clusters was notable. The X-ray luminosity and temperature of clusters showed considerable agreement with logarithmic slopes of the scaling relations, while the normalization was discovered to be lesser in simulations including radiative cooling. Eventually, we suggested analyzing the total SZ decrement in preference to the central intensity for probing the scaling relations."}
{"text":"We explore the angular correlations of galaxies in the COSMOS field, looking at different magnitude depths. Our data, including information from the HST ACS catalog and the Subaru and CFHT ground-based data, show strong agreement. We confirm existing observations at brighter magnitudes. For fainter samples, we observe a higher level of clustering than what was previously reported. This divergence is highlighted when comparing our results with semi-analytic galaxy formation predictions of Kitzbichler and White from the Millennium Simulation. Our measurements are approximately twice as high as predicted and the difference appears to be too large to be explained by cosmic variance. Thus, we conclude that the observed clustering at this level of magnitude is more significant than we previously thought."}
{"text":" This study describes an exploration of the 2006 outburst of the recurrent nova RS Ophiuchi through the use of 1-dimensional hydrodynamic models. Our model considers the wind driven shock, taking into account sudden increased and decreased in wind mass-loss rate and velocity. Mass-loss rate, ejecta velocity and mass are all altered in the models and the shock velocities are examined in comparison to the observations made in Paper I. We take into account the effects of radiative cooling and demonstrate how the manner in which matter is ejected determines the evolution of the shock. The study reveals how the deceleration rate of the shock is influenced by the amount of energy lost due to cooling."}
{"text":"This article presents a method for inferring dynamic genetic networks using low order independencies. Using Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), we can create minimal DAGs which describe the full conditional dependence based on the past of the process. However, the large number of genes and small number of time measurements can make this difficult, so instead, we consider low order conditional independence DAGs, G(q), which still reflect relevant dependence facts for sparse networks. We propose a non-bayesian inference method to analyze simulated and real data, which is available through the R package 'G1DBN' on the CRAN archive."}
{"text":"This article investigates the percolative characteristics of the vacant set that is left after the introduction of a countable set of doubly-infinite paths on a d-dimensional lattice of side-length N, d being greater than or equal to 3. A parameter u is used to measure the number of trajectories included in the model. The model is studied in the large N limit, and the goal is to determine a critical value that determines whether or not the vacant set exhibits percolation. Results show that the critical value is finite for d larger than or equal to 3, and strictly positive for d larger than or equal to 7."}
{"text":"This article explores beyond the semi-classical description of black hole evaporation by considering the effects of gravitational interactions which were previously neglected. To examine these effects, a non-perturbative treatment based on the large-N limit is used, in which the effects of non-linear gravitational interactions appear in higher orders and are governed by the two-point correlation function of the energy-momentum tensor. It is found that the previously unavoidable blue-shifting is stopped at a distance from the horizon $\\propto G\\kappa$ when measured in a freely falling frame. This result is also obtained by considering light propagation in a stochastic ensemble of metrics whose fluctuations are determined by this correlation function."}
{"text":"This paper presents an analysis of diffusion processes on small-world networks which incorporate distance-dependent random links. We study the impact of changing parameters of the distance-dependent links and identify a diverse phase diagram with different transient and persistent states occurring within the scope of network-based random walks. To reach our findings, we applied two general limiting cases: the annealed case in which rearrangement of the random links happens quickly and the quenched case in which link rearrangement is slow relative to the motion of the random walker or surface. Through the development of a finite-scale scaling framework, we confirm our analytic results with numerical diagonalizations of the network Laplacian, allowing us to capture the crossover behaviors that arise within finite networks. By providing an in-depth account of the pertinent self-consistent-perturbative and renormalization techniques, this investigation broadens the scope of understanding diffusion processes in small-world networks."}
{"text":"The present work offers a mechanical proof of the Second Law of Thermodynamics by providing an analysis of the volume entropy. This study looks at the Generalized Helmholtz Theorem and explores how the volume entropy satisfies the heat theorem, and can be considered an adiabatic invariant, which explains the 'equal' sign of the Clausius Principle. We derive from this the 'larger than' sign when considering non-adiabatic transformations. We then go on to show that, provided the natural ordering of probabilities is decreasing, the expected value of volume entropy cannot decrease for any type of external source of work on an insulated system. As such, this is a rigorous quantum mechanical proof of the Second Law, which also relates to the Minimal Work Principle. Lastly, we tackle the Natural Law of Entropy Increase and the possible decrease of entropy in artificially prepared negative temperature systems."}
{"text":"\nThis article examines the hypothesis that quantum gravity may interfere with the procession phases of particles, such as neutrinos, in a foamy structure at small levels. We examine the effects of decoherence on solar and KamLAND neutrinos in the energy range E ~ few MeV in order to probe such effects. Utilizing a perturbative approach on the Sun\u2019s electron neutrino propagation, a calculable damping factor is found which affects decoherence beyond standard methods (e.g. source size, detector resolution). By assuming a power-law dependence with n = 0,+\/-1,+\/-2, we compare theoretical predictions with the data to determine if there is any evidence of non-standard decoherence effects and a constraint on the \u201cLorentz-invariant case\u201d gamma_0<0.78x10^-26 GeV at 95% C.L. is derived. In addition, this approach also improves the bounds on possible matter density fluctuations in the Sun."}
{"text":"\nThis study explores the polarimetric variability caused by the clumping of hot star winds. An analytic clumping model is used to predict the linear polarization evolution over a wide variety of parameter settings. This model is focusing on the variability of Luminous Blue Variables, which have been observed to have the largest polarimetric changes. Our findings infer that two distinct parameter combinations are able to explain the variation levels detected so far. One of these involves a small number of heavy, opaque clumps; the other involves a large number of smaller, less massive clumps. It is yet to be determined which is the correct explanation, however the current analysis seems to favor the latter. It is noted that high mass-loss rate stars may all display polarimetric variability, which is consistent with recent detections of intrinsic polarization with strong H$\\alpha$ emission."}
{"text":"\nThis article presents a new and cost-effective method for extracting freshwater from Earth's atmosphere that is distinct from traditional methods which rely on saline water sources like seawater. The suggested method can be used in most areas of the planet bar Polar Zones, and does not require expensive long-distance freshwater transportation. It has two distinct variations; one which requires no energy input and one which requires a small amount of energy. The first variation involves lifting warm atmospheric air with an inflatable tube to a high altitude, then condensing atmospheric steam into freshwater. The second version involves pumping air twenty to thirty metres below the sea's surface and using wind and a propeller to generate the air flow. Renewable energy such as electricity can be produced using the first high pressure process, and a solar air heater can be used to increase productivity. Additionally, by injecting seawater into the air and using a solar air heater, a huge amount of electricity can be generated at a fraction of the cost of a traditional electric plant."}
{"text":"\nThis paper presents the first ever examination of the dependence of area-averaged, angular N-point galaxy correlation functions $\\bar{\\omega}_{N}$($\\theta$) on luminosity, redshift, and galaxy-type. Using data from the fifth data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we first subdivide a parent sample of $18 \\leq r < 21$ galaxies into two volume-limited samples based on photometric redshifts, then further subdividing these samples into samples separated by magnitude, redshift and color. By doing so, we are able to measure the bias parameters $b_1$ and $c_2$ and compare higher-order correlation functions of early- and late-type galaxies. Our results show that both $b_1$ and $c_2$ are consistently lower for late-type galaxies, and that the values for each parameters can differ greatly between redshifts lower than 0.3 and those higher than 0.3. Furthermore, we observe a higher amplitude of small-scale clustering for late-type galaxies at $z > 0.3$, and our measurements of $c_2$ suggest both a low value of $\\sigma_8$ and negative $c_2$."}
{"text":"\nWe examine 23 young star clusters located in the merging\/interacting galaxy NGC 3256 through Gemini spectroscopic observations. Our research reveals that the clusters' ages range from a few million years to around 150 million years. The clusters are quite massive at between 2 and 40 multiplied by 10^5 solar masses, and appear to have a metallicity of approximately 1.5 times solar. A majority of clusters seem to follow the same rotation curve as the gas in the region and are thought to have been created in the molecular-gas disk. However, some clusters differ in velocities from the track of the gas and these may have been formed in tidal-tail gas from the two merging galaxies. Considering the similarities to Arp 220, NGC 3256 may potentially become an ultra-luminous infrared galaxy as the merger advances and the star-formation rate rises. Furthermore, Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images show that apparently isolated clusters may actually be part of larger clusters or agglomerations of stars. The same phenomenon has previously been observed in the Antennae Galaxies."}
{"text":"The electrical conductivity of non-magnetic Ce$_{1-x}$La$_x$Os$_4$Sb$_{12}$ alloys with concentrations of $x=0.02$ and 0.1 was studied down to 20 mK and in magnetic fields up to 18 Tesla. At low temperatures, both materials had a Fermi-liquid-like temperature dependence on the resistivity with a negative $A$ coefficient in the lower fields. The strong magnetic field dependence was attributed to the formation of a narrow Kondo-hole band in the hybridization gap, with localized states emerging close to the band edges due to disorder. This behavior had a more pronounced effect in the alloy with a larger concentration of $x=0.1$."}
{"text":"\nWe have established a practical Corbino experimental set-up to enable Cooper pair mass spectroscopy and the determination of mobility in the normal phase of a thin superconducting film. The system can measure films of up to 100 nm thick grown on an insulator substrate measuring 10 mm x 10 mm. The experimental configuration includes two Ohmic contacts, one circular (1) with radius ra and one ring-shaped (2) with internal radius rb. Additionally, a mylar ring mounted between the two contacts (3) provides a capacitive connection between the superconducting layer and the metallized surface of the mylar. This arrangement gives the system the potential to work as a field effect transistor (FET) with a circular gate. At low temperatures T<Tc, an AC current of frequency omega is applied between the source (1) and drain (2). This allows the measurement of an AC Bernoulli voltage with double frequency 2f occurring between the gate (3) and the source (1). The 2f frequency is dependent on the Cooper pair effective mass, making the system capable of conducting through Cooper pair mass spectroscopy. The same set-up in the normal phase measures the logarithmic derivative of the density of states (DOS) with respect to the Fermi energy, while the application of a gate voltage yields the mobility in the normal phase."}
{"text":"\nThis paper investigates the feasibility of using the CLIC Drive Beam FEL to realize a $2\\times250$ GeV centre-of-mass energy $\\gamma\\gamma$ collider. By using one bunch of the CLIC drive beam, the authors optimize a Free Electron Laser (FEL) to provide polarized light amplification. An appropriate wiggler and luminosity spectrum is obtained for a 0.5 TeV collision energy. The amplified laser can then be converted to a polarized high-energy $\\gamma$ beam at the Conversion point, prior to the electron-positron interaction point, via Compton backscattering. This paper identifies the essential CLIC Drive Beam and undulator parameters, and goes on to demonstrate that the CLIC Drive Beam parameters meet the demands of the FEL. An envisaged $\\gamma\\gamma$ luminosity of greater than $10^{34}$ can be achieved."}
{"text":"\nA Friedmann-Robertson-Walker model with positive curvature is employed to understand the dynamics of the early universe and the initial conditions for inflation. This particular model contains two fluids, radiation and a Chaplygin gas, and is quantized using the Wheeler-DeWitt prescriptions. The Schutz formalism permits the transformation of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation into a time-dependent Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation, the dynamics of which can be described by an effective potential $V_{ef}$. Using a code implemented in OCTAVE and finite differences method, the time-dependent Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation can be solved and the time evolution of an initial wave packet determined. The wave packet satisfies appropriate boundary conditions and the calculation of tunneling probabilities shows that the universe may transition from the Planck era to an inflationary phase. The tunneling probability can further be affected by the mean energy of the initial wave packet and two parameters related to the Chaplygin gas, and these results are verified by the WKB approximation."}
{"text":"\nBy using N-body simulations in the context of LCDM cosmology, this study explores the varying properties and alignment of dark matter haloes with the large-scale structure in clusters, filaments, sheets and voids since redshift z=1. Results indicate that after normalizing the halo mass with M*, the mass scale collapsing at z, there is no further noticeable evolution. Additionally, a dependence on environment is manifest for haloes with masses below M* at all redshifts. The most evident observation is a substantial alignment of halo spin and shape with the filaments and sheets. In particular, haloes in clusters were identified as more oblate below M* while above the same scale they are usually more prolate. Furthermore, those in filaments have a higher spin rate in comparison with masses of similar size in clusters, voids contain the lowest spin parameters and halo formation times were discovered to be altered in correlated to their locations. Finally, the evidence from this work suggests that the threshold of M* likely marks the starting point of the LSS environment in influencing or even reversing the attributes of DM haloes over the measured redshift range of 0 < z < 1."}
{"text":" The coupling of the stripe phase and elastic strain to the manganite lattice has been investigated through transmission electron microscopy. The research revealed a \"lockin\" effect at $q\/a^*=0.5$ in samples with $x>0.5$ for the first time. This \"lockin\" is an important part of the Landau CDW theory of the stripe phase and substantially reduces the electron-phonon coupling in the CDW Landau theory to a range between 0.04-0.05% of the electron-electron coupling. Additionally, by examining different thin film samples on different substrates, it was determined that the size of the elastic term that encourages an incommensurate modulation is on par with the coupling between the strain and wavevector, signalling a much stronger relationship than anticipated."}
{"text":"This paper discusses the application of cycling \u2013 a form of conjugation \u2013 to elements contained in Artin's braid groups. Initially proposed by Ko, Lee et al. as a difficult problem that could potentially be used in cryptography called 'cycling problem', a polynomial solution is given. This solution is based on the idea that cycling is surjective and employs a result by Maffre which states that pre-images under cycling can be computed quickly. Additionally, the conjugacy search in braid groups is typically achieved by producing finite sets known as ultra summit sets. It is theorized that elements may have larger left USS than right USS, however, this does not hold true for rigid braids. It is then conjectured that this result holds for all elements contained in braid groups and spherical type Artin-Tits groups."}
{"text":"\nThis paper is concerned with examining the adequacy of two widely-used codes, GALFIT and GIM2D, for fitting single-component Sersic models to the light profiles of intermediate-redshift galaxies found in the HST\/ACS surveys. The results of the simulations done show that both fitting codes accurately fit galaxies with high effective surface brightnesses and with exponential disk profiles, yet have difficulty fitting de Vaucouleurs profiles due to their excess light in large radii. Furthermore, both codes have been discovered to underestimate the fitting uncertainties with respect to the true fitted values, though this can be estimated with the help of simulations. In addition, GIM2D demonstrated difficulty in effectively masking neighboring galaxies when determining the profiles of spheroids in close proximity, while GALFIT proved competent in this regard, providing it with an advantage over the other. Lastly, our catalogue provides the fitting results for 41,495 objects within GEMS, with GALFIT's superior speed and accuracy making it the preferred fitting code."}

{"text":"\nWe investigate the substructure characteristics within galaxy-sized halos using large cosmological N-body simulations. We are particularly interested in determining whether or not we can identify halos with the typical mass of the Virgo cluster, but containing significantly fewer substructures, that is, fossil groups. This would help explain the observationally-inferred luminosity function seen in these ancient systems. Examining the relationship of formation time to the number of subhalos, we find there is only a slight suppression factor of 2-2.5, falling short of the 6-fold decrease required for fossil group and galaxy compatibility. Further, we find the substructure velocity function does not vary with formation time. This suggests the substructure population within Cold Dark Matter (CDM) halos is self-similar at scales between galaxies and galaxy clusters, irrespective of their mass. This is contrary to existing observations that indicate there is a break in self-similarity at the group-of-galaxies mass scale."}
{"text":"\nWe propose a new algorithm to obtain valid confidence intervals for a set of parameters within cosmological models. We employ this method to the CMB data collected in the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) for a seven-dimensional parameter space (tau, Omega_DE, Omega_M, omega_DM, omega_B, f_nu, n_s). Our analysis identifies two distinct areas of interest: the standard concordance model, as well as a space with larger values of omega_DM, omega_B, H_0. The second area can be rejected if certain restrictions or priors are applied to the initial values of H_0. Our technique, which is fundamentally non-parametric and frequentist and utilizes a smart search algorithm, produces a confidence \"ball\" that is analogous to the one given by Markov Chain Monte Carlo. The advantage of our algorithm is that it gathers information not only at the peak of the posterior probability function, but also on the 1-alpha confidence surface. Therefore, the product of our work is an effective and efficient mapping of the cosmological confidence ball surface."}
{"text":"\nThis paper discusses the results of simulations generated by the Santa Fe Light Cone Simulation Project using the Enzo N-Body\/Hydro cosmological adaptive mesh code. This project's simulations have a high dynamic range and cover ~100 square degrees in the sky in order to match the resolution and sensitivity of current and upcoming Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect (SZE) instruments. In particular, we investigate potential confusion and the Warm Hot Intergalactic Medium (WHIM) that may arise from cluster line-of-sight overlap in single-dish SZE surveys. We find that objects with masses greater than 5x10^13 M_sun need to be removed from SZE images as even after their removal a third of the total SZE flux still remains from unbound gas and the WHIM. This adds bias and scatter to the Y-M relationship for clusters making calibration more difficult."}
{"text":"\nWe present a new numerical scheme called WHAM for the purpose of accurately and robustly modelling the disparate energy scales of relativistic plasma flows, such as those seen in accretion, winds and jets of active galactic nuclei, x-ray binaries, pulsars and gamma-ray bursts. Our WENO-based, fifth order finite-volume approach employs adaptive reduction to 2-point stencils near discontinuities, while avoiding the excessive reduction to low order stencils seen in the standard WENO formalism. We further use the scheme to correctly perform surface integrals, convert cell averages to point conserved quantities prior to performing the reconstruction step, and correctly average source terms. Our testing indicates good performance in strong shocks, very accurate results in smooth flows, and accuracy in flows even when the energy scales are highly disparate."}
{"text":"This study investigates the influence of relativistic corrections when describing extreme mass ratio bursts (EMRBs) that can be observed by future space-borne gravitational wave detectors, such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). We found that the relativistic effects can drastically alter the amplitude and phase of the waveforms in contrast to those of a Newtonian description. We also propose that identifying and measuring the dephasing across multiple EMRBs could be used to measure the spin of the central massive black hole, allowing us to probe its relativistic character."}
{"text":"\nIn this study, we analyze the statistical behavior of domains generated by two systems which are out of equilibrium. These systems are a quasi one-dimensional gas with two particles in an external driving field, and a one-dimensional spin system with nearest neighbor interactions similarly forced. We observe a dynamical scaling in both cases as well as a domain size distribution which fits the Wigner surmise, suggesting a possible correlation with the circular orthogonal ensemble of random matrices. Nevertheless, our correlation function analysis of domain edges reveals that the domain behavior of both gas and spin systems is not completely well accounted for by the previously mentioned models. We manage, however, to accurately describe the statistical behavior of the domains through a simple model of independent intervals."}
{"text":"This work highlights the experimental studies on the impact of oxygen vacancies on the induced ferromagnetism in undoped TiO2 thin films. Pulsed laser deposition is used to deposit the thin films on Si substrates with different oxygen partial pressures, controlling the oxygen vacancy concentrations. As the vacancy concentration increases, the magnetic moment of the samples decreases. Through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, the presence of higher binding energy component is observed, suggesting the presence of oxygen vacancies in the samples. Valence band measurements were used to examine the electronic structure of both stoichiometric and reduced TiO2 thin films. These measurements indicate the presence of Ti 3d bands in the vicinity of the Fermi level which provides the basis for Stoner splitting."}
{"text":"In this paper, we evaluate and compare the performance of Langevin and Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD) thermostats in a range of non-equilibrium simulations involving polymeric systems. We consider simulations to investigate polymer brushes in sliding motion, polymer liquids exposed to Poiseuille and Couette flows, and brush-melt interfaces with bead-spring models that are exposed to varying degrees of solvent quality. We will look at equilibrium, transient, and steady-state situations to assess the capacity of the two thermostats to maintain temperature conditions and to accurately reproduce physical phenomena in out-of-equilibrium conditions. Additionally, we answer the question of whether it is necessary or beneficial to discontinue the Langevin thermostat when running flow simulations. Finally, we provide a quantitative analysis of how various weight functions influence the efficiency of the DPD thermostat in terms of solvent quality and non-equilibrium states."}
{"text":"\nThis article explores the concept of harmonic sections in sphere bundles with respect to an Euclidean connection, to prove an existence theorem for gauge invariant $L^2$-normal neighborhoods of the reduction loci in the space ${\\cal A}_a(E)$ of oriented connections on a fixed Hermitian 2-bundle $E$. Additionally, these results are used to obtain results on the topology of ${\\cal B}_a(E)$, the moduli space of (non-necessarily irreducible) oriented connections, and to study Donaldson $\\mu$-classes globally around these reductions. We also provide strong generic regularity results for definite 4-manifolds with arbitrary first Betti number, which explain the existence of a connected, dense open set of \"good\" metrics that allow all reductions in the Uhlenbeck compactification of the moduli space to be simultaneously regular. This in turn allows establishing new Donaldson type invariants, confirming that connectedness of the space of good metrics is important, as it demonstrates that no wall-crossing phenomena take place. Last, the compactness of the moduli spaces at low instanton numbers is explored, showing these moduli spaces contain no reductions and that Donaldson type invariants can be naturally defined. The article finally considers if these new Donaldson type invariants yield new differential topological information on the base manifold."}
{"text":"\nWe describe an analytical model to study the diffraction of matter waves by a lattice structure in the region between two regimes: the long-time Bragg-interaction regime and the transient Raman-Nath limit. Our theory utilizes the classic adiabatic approach as a basis and then inserts the derived result into the Schrodinger equation to obtain the second-order correction. Our analytic expressions are suitable for various pulse shapes, various diffraction orders, and include components associated with loss of population to output states, which is otherwise forbidden with the imposed Bragg condition. In addition, we analyze the phase shift caused by the coupling between desired outputs and these same \"forbidden\" states, which depend on the length and strength of the interactions. We provide evidence of how choosing a smooth envelope function (e.g., Gaussian) can alleviate adiabatic errors in even the most complex scenarios. Finally, we introduce an effective method for computing the Rabi frequency in the quasi-Bragg regime, which has the same relation to Mathieu functions as eigenvalues."}
{"text":"\nThis article is focused on the theory of holomorphic bundles over non-algebraic\nmanifolds. We explore familial properties of such bundles, such as stability and\nsemi-stability.

Furthermore, when the family of bundles is generically\nstable over a K\\\"ahler manifold, the Petersson-Weil form is shown to extend as a\nclosed positive current over the parameter space. Using Donaldson's tools from\nYang-Mills theory, families of bundles over a K\\\"ahlerian manifold $Y$ and\nparameterized by a non-K\\\"ahlerian surface $X$ are studied.

{"text":"\nThis paper examines the integral formulas for the probabilities in the asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) with nearest-neighbor hopping rates p and q=1-p on an integer lattice. Using Bethe Ansatz ideas to solve the master equation, we find a formula for the probability of a given configuration at time t, given the initial configuration, for an N-particle system. Additionally, integral formulas are presented to obtain the probability of the m\u2019th left-most particle at x at time t. Finally, when the limit as N goes to infinity is taken, the formula gives the probability of an infinite system with an initial configuration bounded on one side. These formulas reduce to the known equations in the case of the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP)."}
{"text":"\nThis article examines the relationship between accretion disks and blazars. Magnetic field strength is calculated at the base of the jet and extrapolated to the blazar emission area, based on a relativistic axisymmetric jet model and some relativistic flow assumptions. This extrapolated magnetic field is then compared to the estimated fields formed by synchrotron self-Compton and inverse Compton models. The energy flux of the jet is used to estimate the mass accretion rate, and it is found with pure synchrotron self-Compton models that the field strengths are inconsistent. However, with models incorporating local production of soft photons, a closer agreement is found, primarily due to the fact that these models imply magnetic field strengths that are more similar to those with Poynting flux dominated jets. To further analyze the link between accretion disks and blazars, more detailed models for jet propagation and independent estimation of the mass accretion rate will be required."}
{"text":"\nWe analyzed the ramifications of a hypothesized stellar population with an elevated helium abundance in Omega Centauri to determine how this would appear in the color-magnitude diagram. Specifically, we focused on the horizontal branch where higher levels of helium are predicted to have greater visibility. To this end, we devised a technique for contrasting the mass loss experienced by different star systems with a physical basis. It appears that the speculated abundance of high helium stars are unrecognizable in the horizontal branch of Omega Centauri unless their mass loss process differs significantly from that of the usual metal-poor stars. A double main sequence display can be produced in Omega Centauri via assimilation from helium-rich elements that match the recently estimated theoretical yields from AGB ejections, and these affected stars are consistent with the observed horizontal branch morphology. The pollution model aligns with the observed merging of the main sequences as opposed to our potentially helium-rich star model. Using the (B-R)\/(B+V+R) tally, we concluded that the bMS star with its enhanced helium factor needs a bigger age contrast with the other stars than is plausible with regards to Omega Centauri's known rate of mass loss. Conversely, the mass decrease of the pollution model stars is consistent with the inferred extinction rate of Omega Centauri."}
{"text":"\nThe aim of this study is to review the standard X-ray diagnostics available for helium-like plasmas and to assess the effects of photoionization on the line ratios. Our integrated plasma code Cloudy is used to calculate the radiative and collisional processes, as well as the thermal and ionization structure of the gas. We first use semi-analytical calculations and compare with past results obtained in the low-density, optically-thin limit. Subsequently, we perform more detailed numerical simulations of helium-like X-ray emission and make predictions of line ratios as a function parameters such as the ionizing flux, hydrogen density, and column density. Our results show the $R$-ratio, a density indicator in a collisional plasma, is highly sensitive to the ionization fraction and especially to optically thicknesses at high column densities. We also find the $G$ ratio, sensitive to temperature in a collisional plasma, is strongly influenced by continuum pumping and optical depth. These findings demonstrate the limitations of relying solely on collisional models when attempting to interpret observations of helium-like X-ray emission."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate the possibility of obtaining information of a rotating black hole from the eclipsing light curves, taking into account the atmospheric effects of the accompanying star. The non-atmospheric light curves, derived from the blueshifted photons around 1 keV, contain information of the black hole spin due to its shadow size and the position. With an implemented solar-like atmosphere model, the atmospheric effects of the companion star, such as photoionization of HI and HeI, become apparent in the eclipsing light curves. Yet these effects may be larger than the influence of the black hole spin, and the reliable atmospheric models should be used to safely extract the spin information. Nevertheless, the light-curve asymmetries due to the disc rotation exist. In summary, we conclude that it is perhaps possible to recover the strong-gravity regions' information such as the black hole spin through the eclipsing light curves, provided that the atmospheric model is accurately known."}
{"text":"\nThis research investigates the high-speed collapse of two perfect fluids distributed cylindrically. For this purpose we employ an approximation scheme to explore the conditions of very large collapsing speeds of the two fluids. We investigate two scenarios, i.e. when the ratios of the pressures to the densities of the two fluids are bounded or vanish. It is found that if the pressures $p_1, p_2$ are non-zero, the high-speed approximation scheme breaks down once these ratios $c_s, d_s$ reach some positive constants. This breakdown of the high-speed approximation at a particular time in the collapse process indicates an uncertainty about the evolution of the system at and after this juncture. For the bounded case, there does not appear to be any possibility of a naked singularity arising from the two perfect fluids. On the other hand, in the vanishing case if a linear equation of state is used, the collapse is not held back by the pressures and therefore a naked singularity can form. This paper further broadens the results that have already been established by Nakao and Morisawa [1] for perfect fluid systems."}

{"text":"\nThe 658 GHz vibrationally-excited water maser line, discovered in 1995 at the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory (CSO), is seen in oxygen-rich giant and supergiant stars and can be very strong. This was  valuable when commissioning the Submillimeter Array (SMA) interferometer's highest frequency band (620-700 GHz). Starting in late 2002, various sources have been identified, with the number of sources increasing from 10 to 16. The maser emission is quite compact spatially, and these objects can potentially be used as atmospheric phase calibrators, and additionally, many have been found to have maser emission in the vibrationally-excited SiO maser line at 215 GHz. This enables phase transfer calibration between millimeter and submillimeter bands between the two maser lines. Moreover, the 658 GHz masers will be important indicators of the performance of the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) in this difficult high-frequency band."}
{"text":"\nIn this work, the minimum expected distortion under delay constraints of a Gaussian source transmitted over a slowly fading channel has been investigated. Using layered broadcast coding with successive refinements, the receiver decodes the layers that are supported by the channel and reconstructs the source up to some distortion while the transmitter, who possesses no channel state information (CSI), allocates a variable power over each layer. The optimal power distribution that yields the minimum expected distortion, in the limit of an infinite number of layers, was determined by solving a set of linear differential equations related to the density of the fading distribution. Results showed that as the SNR increases, power is allocated to the lower layers; meanwhile, with diminishing bandwidth ratio (channel uses per source symbol), the optimal power distribution converges to that maximizing the expected capacity. While the expected distortion can be improved by either acquiring CSI or increasing diversity, the performance gains of diversity surpassed those of CSI at high SNR, most notably when the bandwidth ratio was large."}
{"text":"\nThis article examines the possible symmetry of highly excited hadrons and how it could be explained by a string model. A unitary transformation is used to demonstrate that the relativistic chiral basis incorporates the ^{2S+1}L_J basis commonly used in hadronic phenomenology and in the string models. It is concluded that in order for chiral multiplets to become degenerate, the description of a highly excited hadron must be in terms of the total hadron spin J, as opposed to a fixed L. Consequently, this requires the string dynamics to deliver principal quantum numbers n+J for proper chiral symmetry."}
{"text":"\nIn this study, we examine the correlations among X-ray parameters and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) parameters for 24 X-ray luminous clusters located within a redshift of 0.14-0.82. From the hydrostatic equilibrium hypothesis and the cluster's spherical symmetry, we analyze the ICM's density, temperature, and pressure profiles. We observe that the correlations among only X-ray quantities are consistent with the earlier results from samples of high-z X-ray-bright galaxy clusters. In terms of the relations involving SZ parameters, the gas temperature correlates with a logarithmic slope greater than the self-similar model's predicted value. The scatter indicates that the central Compton parameter y_0 is a dependable indicator of the gas temperature as with other X-ray properties such as luminosity. The X-ray and SZ scaling relations exhibit a tension between their global energy system and their ICM structure parameters. Consequently, when their slope is fixed to the self-similar value, the relations exhibit a negative deviation, hinting that ICMs in high redshift may have lower X-ray luminosity sensitivity and central pressure than the self-similar model's predictions."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate how lepton flavour violation (LFV) affects the processes of  e+e- --> \\chi+_i \\chi-_j production at a linear collider with e+ and e- beams having longitudinal polarizations. Since the sneutrino mass eigenstates have no fixed flavour in the case of LFV, several of them can contribute to the chargino production cross sections in the t-channel. We use the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) with LFV terms, and find that the cross section for  e+e- --> \\chi+_1 \\chi-_1 can be altered by up to a factor of two when altering the LFV mixing angles, even if the present limit from  BR(tau- --> e- gamma) is increased by a 1000 times. This could significantly affect the strategies for figuring out the model's parameters at the linear collider."}
{"text":"\nA detailed study of the SiO microjet within 1000 AU of the young Class 0 source HH212 has been conducted using the extended configuration of the Plateau de Bure Interferometer (PdBI). Investigating the properties of the microjet at unprecedented resolution of 0.34\" across its axis, we compared it with atomic microjets from more evolved sources in order to gain a better understanding of its origin and collimation process. Velocity gradient analysis of SiO (2-1), (5-4), and (8-7) data from both PdBI and Submillimeter Array revealed a high optical thickness with kinetic temperatures ranging from 50-500 K and an SiO-to-H2 abundance ratio of 0.05-90%. Interestingly, the same degree of collimation was observed in the HH212 Class 0 jet as in T Tauri jets, and it was concluded that these jets are most likely self-collimating due to magnetic fields. Additionally, it is hypothesized that the higher abundance of SiO in these Class 0 jets is a result of rapid molecular synthesis occurring in dense regions of the jet."}
{"text":"We investigate our present-day understanding of the mass-loss process that\noccurs during three main stages of a massive star's life-cycle, i.e. the OB\nmain sequence, the LBV stage and the WR phase. We find that WR stars at\nsub-solar metallicity have a much higher mass-loss rate than those at solar\nmetallicity, implying a connection to GRBs. Additionally, we look into\nrecently observed quasi-periodic modulations of radio lightcurves of certain\nSNe, which we postulate to be a result of LBVs that produce core-collapse SNe."}
{"text":"\nThis study aimed to investigate whether GRB progenitors, namely rapidly rotating Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars, could be constrained by the low-metallicity environment of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). To this end, observations using the Very Large Telescope (VLT) linear spectropolarimetry were carried out on WR stars in the LMC and compared with those from the Galactic sample. We found that only 15% of LMC WR stars showed line polarization effects, similar to the Galactic samples. This suggests that the threshold metallicity where a difference in WR rotational properties occurs is less than that of the LMC (i.e. < 0.5 Zsun). This may in turn imply that GRB progenitor channels are limited to this upper metallicity."}
{"text":"\nA theoretical density functional theory study was conducted to gain further insights into the electronic configuration of Barium titanate. The Vosko-Wilk-Nusair correlation energy functional combined with a generalized gradient approximation (GGA) exchange and correlation energy functional was used for the computations. The results obtained showed a band gap of 1.92 eV, along with quasi-flat bands at -17 eV and -10 eV due to the O 2s and Ba 5p states, respectively. Further, a p-d hybridization between Ti eg and oxygen octahedral orbitals was observed from the total density of states (DOS) and partial DOS analysis. Additionally, the electronic density redistribution along the different crystalline planes was used to show strong p-d overlap and bonding, and even strong bonding between the Ti and O atoms in the (111) crystalline plane was observed."}
{"text":"\nThis research studies the X-ray spectrum of the Seyfert 2 galaxies NGC 2992 and NGC 3081 in the energy band between 1 and 200 keV. Combining INTEGRAL IBIS\/ISGRI, Swift\/BAT and BeppoSAX\/PDS data, it was observed that both galaxies have an unbroken Gamma = 1.8 photon index up to 150 keV. No cut-off was detectable up to the detection limit around 200 keV. The X-ray luminosity of NGC 2992 varied by a factor of 11, yet the spectral shape remained constant. It was suggested that the amount of plasma was changing due to long-term flaring activity, however the physical conditions of the emitting hot plasma remained unchanged."}
{"text":"\nThe structural properties of the L-alanine amino acid were examined through density-functional\nelectronic-structure and molecular dynamics simulations in both aqueous and crystalline form. It was\nfound that the two forms of L-alanine can be significantly different in terms of hydrogen bonding\ninteractions, with the bond lengths and angles of the carboxylate (COO-) group distinguished. The\nanalysis suggests that the bond lengths of the C-O bonds are directly related to the number of water\nmolecules interacting with the COO- unit, which tend to be longer in the crystalline form of the amino\nacid. The hydrogen bond lengths and angles are also observed to be shorter and larger in the aqueous\nform compared to the crystalline one. Consequently, our results imply that the information obtained\nfrom crystallographic data should be used with care when applied to the aqueous form of L-alanine."}
{"text":"\nThis paper describes the development and initial application of a microscopic Monte Carlo approach to model surface chemistry in cold interstellar cloud cores. The technique eliminates the issues encountered by the rate-equation formalism in simulating surface chemistry. The surface chemical network combines three diffusive reactions of H, O, and CO to produce molecules such as molecular oxygen, water, carbon dioxide, formaldehyde, methanol and various radicals. Starting with either a flat or rough olivine surface and using a gas-phase model including accretion onto grains but no surface chemistry or evaporation, we considered the effects of atomic hydrogen evaporation and its impact on the gas-phase abundance and flux onto grains. Our simulations demonstrate agreement with observations of water, CO2, CO, and methanol ices in W33A and Elias 16, with only slight underproduction of mantle CO. This technique should enable further advances in the understanding of gas-grain chemistry in interstellar clouds."}
{"text":"\nThe near-infrared (NIR) properties of dwarf irregular galaxies (dIs) and blue compact dwarfs (BCDs) have been recently studied to gain a better sense of the NIR luminosity of the old stellar populations found in these galaxies. This research has allowed for the development of methods to measure gas fractions and to analyze how BCDs have changed in comparison to dIs. Four BCDs located in the Virgo Cluster were observed at the Gemini-North telescope in 2003 to obtain oxygen abundances that were then used, in conjunction with published values, to formulate correlations between metallicity, Ks luminosity, gas mass, baryonic mass, and gas fraction. The relationship between the oxygen abundance and Ks luminosity appears to be the same for both BCDs and dIs, and a similar trend is seen between metallicity and the gas fraction. These results suggest that BCD evolution has followed a similar pattern to that of dIs, which have evolved largely as independent systems, and that no significant factors such as gas infall have been at play."}
{"text":"\nThis paper studies the unique behavior of the Dynamical Discrete Web (DDW) system introduced by Howitt and Warren. DDW is composed of coalesced one-dimensional random walks that evolve through an extra continuous parameter s. We examine the exceptional (random) values of s which can cause the walkers to behave differently than normal random walks. This behavior is connected to the Hausdorff dimension of the corresponding set of s and is motivated by related observations made by Haggstrom, Peres, Steif and Schramm, who studied dynamical percolation in higher dimensions. This behavior differs notably from Benjamini, Haggstrom, Peres, and Steif\u2019s study of dynamical random walks. We prove that there is a limit for the limsup of S^s(n) \\sqrt n which is governed by a nontrivial relationship. Additionally, we touch on the topic of how our findings extend to the dynamical Brownian web, its scaling version, and the Brownian net of Sun and Swart, all of which are subjects of a paper currently being prepared."}
{"text":"\nThe aim of this article is to analyze the interactions between a spin-half quark or antiquark whose worldline is terminated by a Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) string. A Wilson Loop for a spin-half particle is used as a basis to construct a Super Wilson Loop representation. The results of this interaction can be expressed in an action that is invariant with regards to worldline supersymmetry and contains a boundary term with a spin-string interaction element. It is calculated that the spin-string interaction of a rectangular loop is null, while if an allowance is made to consider the finite intrinsic thickness of the flux-tube, which implies that the spin-string interaction takes place at a distance of the order to its intrinsic thickness, then a spin-spin interaction is established that falls with the 5th power of the distance. Such an action was already suggested by Kogut and Parisi within the context of a flux-tube model of confinement."}
{"text":"\nThe inelastic neutron scattering method has been used to analyze the thermal excitations of V-O and Y-Ba-Cu-O solid solutions. Features centered around 3meV and 5meV were observed in the neutron scattering spectra. These excitations can be explained through the creation of an effective potential of oxygen, resulting in a weakly upwards bottom at the xy plane of a tetragonal octahedron.After further examination, it was concluded that the O1 and O4 atoms of the Y-Ba-Cu-O, as well as the V-O system, were all located in a two-dimensional quantum-well, with a flat base formed by the surrounding atoms copper and barium. These observations suggest that the formation of gyration-like excitations, bolstered by exchange interactions in a matrix lattice, may be significant in modern solid state physics, particularly in explaining the high temperatures and superconducting transitions in high temperature superconductors."}
{"text":"This article focuses on the origin and propagation of cosmic rays, which are particles found in the stellar winds of supernovae, and are accelerated in the shockwave of the explosion. The energy spectrum of these particles are affected by fragmentation and diffusive losses in the galaxy and it is proposed that some cosmic rays are injected as one or two-time ionized particles. Furthermore, the study discusses if cosmic rays have the same velocity, energy or momentum when they are injected. It is also suggested that massive stars with mass of 30-50 solar masses significantly contribute to the cosmic ray energy spectrum, in the proportion of 1:2 for elements with higher atomic number."}
{"text":"In this paper, we examine the implications of measurement errors and levels of contamination in the sample used to construct a white dwarf luminosity function in relation to the 1\/V_max method. We delve into the scope of statistical biases previously and use a Monte Carlo simulator to generate a simulated population for numerous assumptions about the size of the measurement errors and contamination. By comparing the performance of the most resilient luminosity function estimators in such scenarios, we assess the impact of the measurement discrepancies and contamination."}
{"text":"\nWe explore both analytically and numerically the effects of various f(R) gravity theories on spherically symmetric spacetimes. By deriving the corresponding Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov equations, we demonstrate that metric f(R) models lead to a consistent $\\gamma_{\\rm PPN}=1\/2$ Parameterized Post-Newtonian parameter, which is unchanged when dark matter is introduced. The same metric model however produces a $\\gamma_{\\rm PPN}\\approx1$ result, which proves to be a short-lived solution. In contrast, our analysis of the Palatini version of the theory complies with experiments done in the Solar System. In assessing compact stars, we discover no discrepancies between the Palatini formalism and the polytropic equations of state. We finally reflect on the parallel between f(R) gravity and scalar-tensor theories, arguing that not all interesting Palatini f(R) models can be presented as a limiting case of a Jordan-Brans-Dicke theory with $\\omega \\to -3\/2$."}
{"text":"In this paper, we explore the global structure and physical interpretation of Fonarev's solution to a scalar field with an exponential potential. This solution features a single parameter $w$, with the ability to be set to either $\\pm1$, plus the steepness parameter $\\lambda$ in the potential. After analyzing this solution, we find that it is conformally static and asymptotically flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker spacetime, reducing to the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker solution when $w=0$. Two types of singularities are present, one being a timelike central singularity, the other being a big-bang or big-crunch singularity. Additionally, depending on the parameters, the spacetime could potentially include a future outer trapping horizon- qualifying it to be a dynamical black hole according to Hayward's definition, despite the presence of a locally naked singularity at the center and lack of a black-hole event horizon."}
{"text":"\nIn this work, we explore the charge polarization impacts on the extended physical characteristics of AlxGa1-xN\/GaN superlattices by using the Theory of Finite Periodic Systems (TFPS). We analyze the dependence of linear and parabolic band edges and their respective transmission coefficients and valence band structure. The significant results that we achieved include a distinctive level density asymmetry to identify the quantum confined Stark effect, a wider bandgap at higher internal electric fields, and higher miniband densities with higher layer widths. Additionally, we present the transmission amplitudes, coefficients and miniband structures for various values of the relevant parameters. Overall, this research provides a detailed understanding of the effects of charge polarization on the physical properties of the superlattices."}
{"text":"\nThe transient hard X-ray source IGR J11321-5311 was detected by the INTEGRAL satellite during observations of the Crux spiral arm in June 2005, representing the only detection reported by any X\/gamma-ray mission. To characterize the behaviour and nature of the source, temporal and spectral IBIS analysis was thoroughly carried out. The source was identified to have been active for approximately 3.5 hrs, with a short and intense flare lasting about 1.5 hrs reaching a peak flux of 80 mCrab or 2.2x10E-9 erg cmE-2 sE-1 (20--300 keV).The spectrum of the outburst was best fitted by the combination of a power-law (Gamma=0.55+\/-0.18) and a black body (kT=1.0{+0.2}_{-0.3} keV) with no break up to 300 keV. Analysis of the data revealed a hardening of the spectrum during the outburst without detection of pulsations. The X-ray spectral shape and flaring behaviour favor the hypothesis that IGR J11321-5311 is an Anomalous X-ray Pulsar, although other possibilities cannot be ruled out conclusively at this stage."}
{"text":"\nResults of an investigation of the magnetic spectra of strongly underdoped YBa$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{6.35}$ (T$_{c}$ = 18 K), where low-energy scattering forms an excitation cone radiating from the antiferromagnetic (0.5, 0.5) wave vector with an acoustic velocity similar to that of insulating cuprates, show extraordinary features at high energy transfers below the maximum energy of 270 meV at (0.5, 0). These features include a greater zone boundary dispersion and energy loss than can be found in insulating antiferromagnets, an overall decrease in zone-boundary energies, and a significantly large damping of spin excitations around 100 MeV. The energy at which this damping occurs is roughly in line with the gap observed in transport measurements, suggesting that at higher energies, the spin excitations may decay into particle-hole pairs related to the pseudogap."}
{"text":"\nIn this work, we examine the relativistic and electromagnetic effects on the diocotron instability previously observed in the differentially rotating equatorial disk of pulsar electrospheres in the non-relativistic regime. We have developed an algorithm to incorporate low-density plasma information into the linearised dependent relativistic cold-fluid and Maxwell equations. This allows us to solve for the relativistic eigenspectrum of diocotron instability in a non-planar geometry between two cylindrically conducting walls. For slow speeds, the non-relativistic eigenfunctions and eigenspectra are recovered. With increasing relativistic and electromagnetic forces, the instability is seen to stabilise. In a cylindrical geometry, for some select rotation profiles, all azimuthal modes $l$ are quenched for sufficiently hig-speed flows. However, for a profile more relevant to the electrosphere, the growth rates are either drastically reduced or remain for moderate $l$ depending on the exact rotation curves present."}
{"text":"\nUsing the near-infrared camera (CIAO) installed on the 8 m Subaru telescope, we conducted a polarimetric analysis of the bipolar nebula IRAS 19312+1950. By studying its spectral energy distribution, total intensity image and fraction of linear polarization map, we were able to interpret the physical properties of both the central star and the nebula. Our results showed that the nebula presents a spherical core, an S-shaped arm extending in a northeast to southwest direction and an extended lobe in the southwest. The polarization map showed a centro-symmetric vector alignment in the nebula and low polarizations were spotted along the S-shape arm, indiciating that the nebula is likely encircled by a central star and has a ring-like structure. Response to our dust radiative transfer modeling, we gained estimations of the stellar temperature, the bolometric luminosity, and the current mass-loss rate, which are 2800 K, 7000 L_sun and 5.3x10\u22126 M_sun yr\u22121, respectively. With the inclusion of other previous observations such as SiO maser emissions and silicate absorption at 10 $\\mu$m, our near-infrared imaging polarimetry analysis suggested that the central star of IRAS 19312+1950 is an oxygen-rich, dust-enshrouded AGB star and that the circumstellar material has its origin from other sources opposed to mass loss from the central star."}
{"text":"\nThis article examines the relationship between strong pseudogap and superconducting states in cuprates. We propose that the strong pseudogap state is a result of off-diagonal short-range order, consisting of quasi-stationary pairs of repulsing particles with a large total momentum (K-pairs). A phase transition from this ODSRO state to an off-diagonal long-range ordered (ODLRO) state of superconductivity occurs with Bose-Einstein condensation of K-pairs. Moreover, a checkerboard spatial order in the superconducting state is attributable to an increase in the K-pair density wave. It is the competition between these ODSRO and ODLRO states providing a phase diagram akin to that seen in cuprates. Additionally, a biordered superconducting state composed of Cooper pairs with zero momentum and K-pairs explains a number of properties of the cuprates below the critical temperature: Drude optical conductivity, a unique isotope effect and a two-gap quasiparticle spectrum characterized by distinct energy scales."}
{"text":"In this article, the Minkowski Space Conformal Symmetry is utilized to construct time inhomogeneity one-parameter conformal transformations, which have a connection to the Hubble Constant. These transformations offer an explanation for the Pioneer Anomaly - a Blue-Shifted frequency drift - suggesting it is a kinematic effect from the expanding Universe. Further, a generalized Special Relativity clock synchronization procedure is applied to demonstrate the phenomenon's validity. The analytic expression for the speed of recession is then determined to a maximum value, which corresponds to the experimentally measured red shift from the deceleration to acceleration of the Universe."}
{"text":"\nWe seek to explore the stratified makeup of the GG Tau circumbinary ring through scrutiny of four different scattered light images from the 800 to 3800 nm range. This process allows us to compare two models of stratification--a parametric prescription and bi-fluid hydrostatic calculations--in order to discern any evidence it may present. The two models seem to replicate the data accurately, with the parametric prescription matching the brightness profile and the hydrostatic calculations correctly accounting for star\/ring integrated flux. An alternate solution of a well-mixed, yet \"irregular\" dust size distribution fits the brightness profile but not the star\/ring flux ratio. This research provides evidence of dust stratification in the GG Tau ring and suggests that a radial stratification is likely present as well."}
{"text":"\nIn this paper, the behavior of droplets in two-dimensional +-J spin glasses is studied using numerical techniques that are more advanced than common approaches such as Monte Carlo simulations. By utilizing a matching algorithm to calculate the ground states of the tested systems, it is possible to look into large systems with L^2=256^2 spins. Three different +-J models were examined under open boundary conditions, fixed boundary conditions, and with a fraction p=0.125 of all bonds being zero. As for the large systems, it was revealed that the droplet energy had a power-law behavior with \\theta'_D<0. Correction for non-compactness has led to a likely match with \\theta_D=-0.29 for all three systems. Furthermore, the spin-spin correlation exponent \\eta was observed to be at 0.22, which diverges from the model with Gaussian interactions that has \\eta=0."}
{"text":"\nWe present the results from simultaneous chandra and rxte observations of 3C 382, a Bright-Line Radio Galaxy (BLRG) with a luminous X-ray emission. Our long, 120-kilosecond chandra HETG exposure reveals a steep power law or thermal model for the soft X-ray continuum and a narrow Fe Kalpha line (with an equivalent width lower than 100 eV). The rxte PCA data restrict the hard X-ray continuum and confirm the absence of any detectable broad line component. By splitting the observation into two sessions, three days apart, we can probe the source's spectral and temporal variability. We find significant flux changes occurring over both hour and day timescales that are similar to those seen in radio-quiet active galactic nuclei (AGNs), excluding a jets-dominated origin of the X-rays. The circumnuclear diffuse emission, apparent on scales of 20-30 arcseconds (22-33 kpc), contributes to the observed soft excess."}
{"text":"This paper reports on a study of the microvariability among Mira stars, which was initially explored by DeLaverny et al. (1998). The results of this study suggested the presence of short-term brightness variations in the light curves of these stars on time-scales ranging from 2 to 100 hours, which could indicate interesting changes in atmospheric dynamics and dust formation processes. With CCD V and R band data, the authors have been able to explore the apparent microvariability in more detail, and present an interpretation of this phenomenon in terms of changes in the stellar interior structure, atmospheric structure, and\/or the formation of circumstellar material. They propose that the alleged underlying activity is most likely undetected transient overtone pulsations in Miras\u2019 light curves."}
{"text":"\nThe CLEO III detector at the Cornell Electron Storage Ring was used to compare particle production in quark- and gluon-fragmentations processes at sqrt s ~ 10 GeV. Per-event total particle yields were compared in Upsilon(1S)->ggg and e+ e- -> qqbar continuum, illustrating greater baryon production in 3-gluon fragmentation. Further, a photon-tagged study of Upsilon(1S)->gggamma and e+ e- -> qqbar+gamma was carried out to investigate two-parton and three-parton fragmentation. Enhancement ratios (defined as the ratio of gluon-to-quark fragmentation yields) determined that baryon production in radiative two-gluon fragmentation was lower than in the Upsilon(1S) three-gluon decays. Furthermore, our results on baryon production disagree with the JETSET (7.3) fragmentation model."}

{"text":"\nThis paper presents the results of an in-depth imaging and spectroscopic investigation into the optical emissions associated with supernova remnant 3C 58 (Fesen et al. 2007). Our results demonstrate a significant bimodal distribution of radial velocities, with ~450 knots showcasing both high-velocity (700-1100 km\/s) and low-velocity (~250 km\/s) expansions. We classify these two populations as supernova explosion ejecta, and shocked circumstellar material, respectively; likely produced from prior mass loss events. The two groups also display dissimilar chemical signatures, with the high-velocity group exhibiting elevated [N II]\/H-alpha ratios, implying a higher enrichment of nitrogen in the SN ejecta than in the surrounding circumstellar material. In conclusion, 3C 58 and the Crab nebula, both of which share similar properties, could represent case studies of mass-loss occuring from core collapse-type supernova progenitors of approximately 8 to 10 solar masses."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate how interstellar stars and massive black holes interact with one another, and how these encounters can lead to accretion of material onto the central hole. Through exploring the gravitational field of the system under the influence of the central hole, the cluster mean field and a gaseous disc\/torus, we find that the Kozai oscillations can cause variations in stellar orbits that increase the chances of stars being torn apart by the central black hole. We analyse the relative strengths of various gravitational effects that can enhance the number of tidal disruption events. Our results suggest that for black holes with mass M_bh~10^4M_s, the combination of the cluster mean field, relativistic pericentre advance and the Kozai mechanism can result in star disruption rates which are up to 100 times higher than previously explored models. By contrast, when the black hole mass increases, the predicted number of star disruptions declines due to competition between the various gravitational influences."}
{"text":"\nThe outcomes of our exploitation of fossil fuel reserves is not only uncertain, but highly flexible and dependent on our own choices - particularly those involving unconventional fossil fuels found in extreme or pristine environments, and those of 'peak oil'. In light of estimates from the Energy Information Administration, and recent trends towards lower estimations, there is a possibility to limit atmospheric CO2 emissions to roughly 450 ppm by 2100 by constraining coal, unconventional fossil fuels, and land use. To achieve this, coal-fired power plants must be phased out before mid-century, and there must be a focus on conserving and 'stretching' conventional oil reserves, as well as developing clean technologies for 'beyond fossil fuels'. Ultimately, a rising price on carbon emissions may be the most effective strategy to discourage conversion of fossil losses into usable reserves and keep CO2 beneath the 450 ppm ceiling."}
{"text":"\nWe explore the nonlinear evolution of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in\nthe dark matter power spectrum and correlation function using renormalized\nperturbation theory (RPT). In our prior study, we showed that RPT effectively\ndescribes the damping of acoustic oscillations. We extend this investigation in\norder to quantify the increase in power which is brought about by\nmode-coupling. We find that the mode-coupling produces additional, out of\nphase oscillations, leading to changes of node positions, when compared to a\nsmooth spectrum. Upon Fourier transforming, these oscillations contribute to\nthe correlation function and induce percent-level shifts in the peak amplitude\nof the two-point correlation. Our prediction of these shifts is provided as a\nfunction of redshift. This effect should be taken into account while\nenvisaging more realistic models, which also factor in redshift distortion and\ngalaxy bias into their consideration. Our analysis suggests that the\nbreakdown of linear theory happens at scales much larger than was previously\nthought.

{"text":"\nThis article explores the possibility of using continuous tensegrities as a framework for understanding different aspects of rigidity in Euclidean space. A continuous tensegrity is described as a set of points in Euclidean space connected by unordered pairs of vertices with various upper and lower length bounds, or \"bars\". Roth and Whiteley's 1981 paper \"Tensegrity Frameworks\" demonstrated that in certain cases, struts and cables could be replaced with simpler bars for analysis purposes. In this article, we explore the conditions in which a continuous tensegrity with a strictly positive stress is bar equivalent and show that a minimally bar equivalent tensegrity must have a strictly positive stress. As an example, we examine the case of a rectifiable curve with restricted motions and show that there is no locally arclength preserving motion of a circle that increases any antipodal distance without decreasing another one."}
{"text":"This article outlines a method for deriving a generic, deterministic framework which incorporates leading-order noise terms to analyze the qualitative behavior of small, stochastic genetic circuits. The method is used to analyze the effects of model parameters on sound susceptibility, stability phase diagrams, and more. Examples of two distinct genetic circuits are used to illustrate the method: a bistable positive-feedback loop and a negative-feedback oscillator. The results show that introducing noise into the system leads to more stable behavior in the bistable circuit, and can be harnessed in the negative-feedback loop to generate reliable oscillations."}

Furthermore, we extend the Duistermaat-Heckman theorem to the case of an $H$-twisted generalized Calabi-Yau manifold acted upon by a torus. As a secondary outcome of this, we prove that the generalized K\\\"ahler quotient of a generalized K\\\"ahler vector space does not have a (cohomologically) non-trivial twisting, yielding a negative answer to a query about gauged linear sigma models with non-trivial fluxes voiced by physicists."}
{"text":" Our survey has revealed that a number of Seyfert galaxies contain compact nuclear starbursts, shown by detections of luminous HCN(1--0) emissions. While a few of the Seyfert galaxies in our sample, including NGC 1068, NGC 1097, NGC 5033 and NGC 5194, do not appear to contain starbursts, the elevated HCN(1--0) emission from these particular sources could be attributed to overabundance of HCN molecules in X-ray dominated regions (XDRs). Utilizing the Nobeyama Millimeter Array, our research shows that star formation rate is associated with the HCN(1--0) luminosity in star-forming galaxies."}
{"text":"\nWe have performed a topological investigation on the HI distribution in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Our analysis identified various clumps and holes of various sizes ranging from 19-29 pc to 485 pc. At the smallest scales (19-29 pc) the mass is distributed in small clumps among a pervading low-density background. Larger scales (73-194 pc) illustrate a general hole topology that is likely attributed to stellar winds from hot stars. At scales from 240 to 340 pc, the HI map is characterized by a slight clump topology due to giant cloud associations in the spiral arms and thick filaments encompassing superholes. At the largest scales examined (390-485 pc), we observed hole topology again, with a few superholes likely stemming from supernova explosions in the outer disk. The gaps found between the bar and spiral arms have a minor influence on the topology of the system at this level."}
{"text":"This paper presents an improved calculation of the {2p_{1\/2}}-{2s}, {2p_{3\/2}}-{2s} transition energies, and ground-state hyperfine splitting in ${\\rm Sc}^{18+}$, which takes into account two- and three-electron contributions up to two-photon levels in a bound-state Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) model. Interelectronic interactions beyond two-photon level are handled using a large-scale Configuration Interaction (CI)-Dirac Fock-Sturm method and the relativistic recoil correction is calculated with many-electron wave functions to incorporate the effect of electron-correlation. In comparison to previous calculations, the accuracy of the transition energies has increased by five-fold. The results of our calculations are compared to the recent experimental data, with close agreement."}

{"text":"\nThis paper presents a solution to the Kirillov-Reshetikhin conjecture for all twisted quantum affine algebras. We provide explicit formulas for characters of KR modules and the twisted Q-system, as well as introduce new developments for the representation theory of these algebras, including twisted Frenkel-Reshetikhin q-characters. Moreover, we prove the formulas for KR modules in two types, A_n^{(2)} and D_4^{(3)}, which have been conjectured by Kuniba-Suzuki. In addition, we use our results to suggest branching rules to the quantum subalgebra of finite type. The proof is uniform and covers both the untwisted simply-laced case treated by Najakima and the untwisted case by the author. "}
{"text":"\nThis study examines the distinct stellar populations of 24 early-type spiral galaxies, including Sa-types, by collecting and analyzing absorption line strength maps with a custom-built integral-field spectrograph. The results show a wide range of ages, from <1 Gyr to old, with the larger scatter found at lower velocity dispersions. Such a wide variety of ages is at odds with highly-inclined samples, in which typically only the oldest stellar populations are found in the middle regions. Our sample of spirals have Mg b- and H beta - $\\sigma$ properties similar to those of elliptical galaxies in the Coma cluster, yet a larger scatter in absorption line indices like Mg b - H beta and Mg b -Fe 5015. In many cases these young stars are found in the circumnuclear star forming rings and mini starbursts dominating the light of some early-type spirals. This data presents evidence of the variety of stellar populations, with the potential to better understand their formation and distribution in spiral galaxies."}
{"text":"\nIn this study, Ochiai et al. propose a high-throughput cross-layer scheme for distributed wireless ad hoc networks to reduce the collaboration overhead. The approach is designed in two stages; the first stage involves nodes randomly transmitting local signals which, when collided, are analyzed as linear combinations of the packets. In the second stage, cooperating nodes form a distributed antenna system and beamform the received analog waveform to distant recipients. The process needs multiplication of the received waveform by a complex number generated uniquely by each cooperating node to separate collided packets. All nodes must have insight into the network coordinates for this to succeed, and the scheme can achieve throughputs of over one under certain conditions."}

{"text":"This paper investigates a novel, irregular, abstract yet physically plausible 3D small-world interconnect fabric design inspired by existing Network-on-Chip (NoC) architectures, as a possible solution to the challenges posed by self-assembling nano-scale electronics. By empirically testing its various parameters, such as connectivity and the number of switch nodes, in addition to deploying a simple synchronisation task, this paper evaluates the trade-offs and properties of this new design. Results support the notion that self-assembled nano-scale electronics can benefit from a computationally efficient and reliable framework in the form of a 3D small-world interconnect fabric, with its power-law decaying distribution of shortcut lengths offering advantages over local 2D and 3D regular topologies."}
{"text":"\nIn this paper, we propose a novel method based on the generator coordinate (GC) approach to incorporate memory effects into any existing approximation of the exchange-correlation (XC) potential in time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT). This time-dependent GC method is proven to be simpler in implementation than other approaches, and is used to study the driven parametric oscillations of two interacting electrons in a harmonic potential (Hooke's atom). Our results suggest that a suitable choice of time-dependent generator coordinates combined with the adiabatic local-density approximation accurately reproduces the exact dynamics of this system, including the occurrence of double excitations which are not captured by traditional TDDFT in adiabatic approximation."}
{"text":"\nThis paper explores the behavior of two-photon interactions utilizing down-converted light with a bandwidth greater than the pump bandwidth, resulting in a temporally pulse-like and spectrally narrow behavior. When the threshold of low photon flux is reached, the entanglement of the down-converted photons in time and energy is evidenced. Such two-photon interactions such as two-photon absorption (TPA) and sum-frequency generation (SFG) can manifest similarly, as long as the final state is of a narrowband nature. The theory is formulatated with operators for two-photon interactions induced by broadband light, and the presence of linear losses does not affect its validty. To form a better understanding of this behavior, a quantum-mechanical expression for the down-converted amplitude stimulated by an arbitrary pump is derived, valid in both high- and low-power regimes. This model is verified to be in excellent agreement with experimental results of TPA and SFG using high power down-converted light and entangled photons."}
{"text":"\nThis article provides an update on the discoveries of exoplanets over the last 11 years. A physical definition of a planet as an object made of the leftover material from a protostellar disk is described, noting their radial sequence formation and dense cores. After careful inspection, it is concluded that none of the exoplanets discovered thus far are planets in the traditional sense, instead being cryptoplanets formed by matter ejected by protostars. Their characteristics of mass, radius, orbit and density are random, making them different to planets. This article offers an analysis of this phenomena, how they can merge or become ejected, and how they differ in density to planets."}
{"text":"This paper introduces two formulations of general relativity derived from the Arnowitt, Deser, Misner (ADM) and Kidder, Scheel, Teukolsky representations. These systems have the desirable property of turning the constraint surface into a local attractor in the ADM frame while their Kidder, Scheel, Teukolsky incarnation resembles the compressible Navier-Stokes equations. By performing a stability analysis of flat space, it was determined that the first modification exponentially damps and eliminates all constraint-violating modes. These systems allow for long-term and stable numerical integration of the Einstein equations."}
{"text":"\nThis paper provides an initial exploration of the feasibility of integrating logic circuits with spin wave bus technology. Instead of using charge to transfer information, this alternate approach seeks to transmit information using spin waves. Our study examines the theoretical aspects and numerical simulations of the attenuation of signals, the speed of signal propagation and the minimum energy required to send a bit in the spin bus. Comparisons are drawn to conventional electronic transmission lines. Results of the simulations demonstrate that Spin Wave Bus does not replace traditional metal interconnects. Nevertheless, this technology offers potential for interfacing electronic and integrated spintronics circuits, and provides the possibility of wireless read-in and read-out capabilities."}
{"text":"This paper examines the complexity of financial (and general economic) processes by contrasting classical and quantum-like models of randomness. Results indicate that a quantum-like probabilistic model could be more fitting for the financial market than classical models. Efforts to understand how this probabilistic approach applies to agents of the financial market are included in the analysis. It is suggested that the quantum-like probabilistic behavior stems from the context of statistical data in finance (and economics in general), and should be assessed experimentally (contrary to the classical probabilistic method that is non-contextual). Finally, a new statistical test is proposed here, which builds on a generalization of the famous Bell's Inequality from quantum physics."}
{"text":"\nThe present study examines the potential origin of Hypervelocity Stars (HVSs) in the environment of the supermassive black hole, Sgr A*, and its associated impact on the Milky Way halo. We use a sample of unbound and bound HVSs from Brown et al. as well as numerical simulations of their propagation in the halo to evaluate the plausibility of three potential ejection processes: 1) capture by an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) orbiting Sgr A*; 2) disruption of stellar binaries in the substantial gravitational field of Sgr A*; and 3) two-body scattering of stars and a cluster of stellar-mass black holes. Comparing the predicted radial and velocity distributions of HVSs with the limited-available dataset, the IMBH model appears to generate an ejection spectrum of velocities that is too flat. With the promise of future surveys of HVSs, such as deep wide-field astrometric observations, greater insight into the ejection mechanism and Milky Way potential on a large scale (200 kpc) can be expected."}
{"text":"\nThe transient X-ray pulsar 4U 0115+63 underwent efficient outbursts in 1999 and\n2004, which were observed using RXTE and INTEGRAL on a wide energy range (3-100\nkeV). The authors determined that the energy of the lowest resonance absorption\nline in the spectrum near the cycle's peak (luminosity ranging from 5x10^{37} -\n2x10^{38} erg\/s) is ~11 keV. They further report that when the luminosity of\nthe pulsar falls to below 5x10^{37} erg\/s, the resonance line energy significantly\nincreases up to ~16 keV and the height of the confined emission region reduces\nby ~2 km with no change in other spectral parameters. In addition, when the\nluminosity is at ~7x10^{37} erg\/s, four approximately equal resonance line\nharmonics become visible, implying a compact emission spot or uniform radiation\nfrom several accretion columns. The study also provides evidence of considerable\nvariations in the pulse profile depending on energy, luminosity change and\ntime of the outburst. Thus, it is clear that the modulation of the accretion\nrate is not the sole reason for the observed pulse profile variability."}
{"text":"\nThis paper looks into the properties of gauge theories defined in more than four dimensions, where the extra dimensions take the form of a fuzzy (finite matrix) manifold. We compare this to the well-known Kaluza-Klein views of lower-dimensional gauge theories, noting multiple key differences. These include effectively non-abelian gauge theories arising from higher-dimensional abelian theories, the emergence of spontaneous symmetry breaking in the extra dimensions, and the renormalizability of both higher- and lower-dimensional theories. Then we explore the inversion of this approach, with a renormalizable four-dimensional $SU(N)$ gauge theory whose symmetry breaking generates a fuzzy sphere of extra dimensions by way of extra scalar fields. This generates a corresponding tower of massive Kaluza-Klein modes, with the scalars themselves representing the gauge fields on the sphere. With suitable parameterization, the resulting low-energy gauge group can become $SU(n_1) \\times SU(n_2) \\times U(1)$."}
{"text":"This article discusses the current status of two interferometric gravitational wave detectors, TAMA300 and CLIO, being developed for the large cryogenic gravitational wave telescope (LCGT) in Japan.

CLIO is a 100-m prototype aiming to improve the interferometer's performance in cryogenic conditions. The first operation of the cryogenic interferometer was successfully demonstrated in February of 2006 and current sensitivity at room temperature is close to the target sensitivity, with various observation experiments being conducted. Once the displacement noise is similar to the thermal noise level of room temperature, the improvement of cooling test mass mirrors will be demonstrated."}
{"text":"\nBy conducting a study of the fraction of broad absorption line quasars (BALQSOs) in the 2MASS detected quasars sample within the SDSS DR3 data in the redshift range 1.7 to 4.38, we obtained fractions of 40.4% and 38.5%, which are significantly higher than the 26% observed in the optical bands of the same parent sample. Additionally, the fractions of BALQSOs steadily increase with wavelengths from the SDSS u to the 2MASS K_s bands. A K-S test revealed that BALQSOs have redder i-K_s color distributions than non-BALQSOs. To further analyze the results and infer the true BALQSO fraction, we ran a simulation considering quasar luminosity function and a certain amount of obscuration associated with BALQSOs. The results show an intrinsic BALQSO fraction of 43% for luminous quasars (M_{K_s} \\lesssim -30.1 mag)."}
{"text":"\nThis article explores the reduction of a mechanical system whose configuration space lies on a Lie group and whose Lagrangian is invariant to left translations on that group. By making certain assumptions about the system's mass geometry, the reduced vector field reveals a remarkable hydrodynamic interpretation of a stationary flow of an ideal fluid. In addition, the right- or left-invariant symmetry fields of the reduced field determine its vortex manifolds. When faced with the standard control problem of bringing the system from an initial position to a predetermined one via internal control forces, we reveal that the mass geometry can also be used to move the corresponding vortex manifolds. In this way, the control of mechanical systems on Lie groups and its ideal hydrodynamics are connected."}
{"text":"\nThis deep astrometric and photometric study of the ancient, populous cluster NGC2682 (M67) allowed us to identify fundamental parameters. Our expanded uvby-Hbeta CCD photometry examines an area about 50'x50', going as faint as magnitude 19, with a thorough membership segregation derived from astrometric and photometric criteria.

{"text":"\nWe analyze the wetting transition of a one-dimensional random walk on a half-line, $x\\ge 0$, in the presence of a short-ranged potential based at the origin, $x=0$. We explore the effect that chemical disorder has on the pinning-depinning transition point. To this end, a perturbative technique is developed to compute the temperature (energy) at the transition point. By introducing the idea of viewing the random potential as a periodic potential with large period, $n$, we are able to integrate over all spatial degrees of freedom to reduce the model to the analysis of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of a non-Hermitian random matrix with disorder-dependent diagonal and constant off-diagonal coefficients. Both numerical and renormalization group approaches are used to estimate the transition point for strong disorder. Ultimately, we ascertain that the transition point for a system with randomly distributed motifs is indistinguishable from the transition point for a system with preaveraged (annealed) Boltzmann weight."}
{"text":"This paper reviews the evidence for periodicity in fossil biodiversity over the course of the Phanerozoic era, as suggested by Rohde & Mueller (2005). We investigate the strength of the signal found by Rohde & Mueller (2005) and evaluate the occurrence of periodicity in origination and extinction of animal species. Our analysis discovers fluctuations in biodiversity in the Paleozoic and early Mesozoic eras and indicates that there may be a 62 million year periodicity as suggested by Rohde and Mueller (2005). Additionally, our findings suggest artifacts at a 27 million year period in origination and extinction, potentially lending evidence to a periodicity in these processes as well. This review highlights the importance of considering the impact of cosmic rays on the fossil record and emphasizes the potential of a more thorough evaluation of biodiversity cycles."}
{"text":"\nWe present the first complexity and inapproximability results for the task of computing the value of one-round games involving a verifier and a team of provers who can share quantum entanglement. We demonstrate the NP-hardness of approximating the value of the game with a classical verifier and three entangled provers or with a quantum verifier and two entangled provers within an inverse polynomial. Moreover, we propose a mathematical conjecture that, if verified, would imply hardness of approximation within a constant factor. To prove our results, we establish two ways to modify classical multi-prover games to make them resilient to entangled provers and then show that a strategy that utilizes entanglement can be ``rounded'' to one that does not. Consequently, our results imply that, unless P=NP, the values of entangled-prover games cannot be computed with semidefinite programming that is polynomial in the size of the verifier's system, a strategy which has been successful for more restricted quantum games."}
{"text":"We propose an alternative formulation of N=1 supersymmetry whereby a vector multiplet is associated with a non-adjoint representation of SO(N) rather than the conventional adjoint. Doing so requires the introduction of new 'generators' U^i in the chosen real representation R that interact algebraically with the generators T^I of SO(N). We present explicit examples of such a setup in both four and eight dimensions, and consider low energy scenarios whereby the new gauge fields attain positive definite (mass)^2 via a Higgs mechanism. Superspace reformulation is presented as an independent check on our results."}
{"text":" This article proposes that radiation belts similar to those found in planetary magnetospheres can form in pulsars with long periods and strong magnetic fields. Such radiation belts are maintained within the closed field lines near the light cylinder through the trapping of relativistic pairs and direct injection of particles from an outer gap or in situ ionization of the accreted material. It is suggested that disruption of these radiation belts caused by instability waves or stellar oscillations can result in a particle precipitation toward the star, producing transient radio emission in the form of rotating radio transients (RRATs)."}
{"text":"\nResearchers are eager to confirm direct WIMP dark matter particle detections from the galactic halo as scientific proof of their existence, and a step towards this is the use of a direction-sensitive detector. This experiment can measure the velocity anisotropy of the halo, denoted as 'beta', which, according to cosmological N-body simulations, is nonzero for dark matter, but zero for baryonic matter. Through Monte Carlo analysis, it has been concluded that detecting more than 10^4 WIMP events with nuclear recoil energies of 100 keV or more in a 32S target, leading to a precision of around 0.03, can increase the chances of improving the sensitivity greatly. Backgrounds and other potential factors have been considered during the study, and the findings have shown that a direction-sensitive detector is a resilient way of distinguishing between dark matter and baryonic matter."}

{"text":"In this study, we present magnetic field strength measurements of 14 classical T Tauri stars. We compare these data with the field strengths predicted by magnetospheric accretion models and discuss the correlation between these values. Additionally, we investigate the relationship between surface magnetic flux and X-ray luminosity using our field strength measurements and X-ray data from the literature. We find that the magnetic fields in our observed T Tauri stars are much stronger than expected, resulting in X-ray emission that is weaker than predicted by the relationship. We suggest this is due to the strong fields suppressing flux tube tangling in the photosphere."}
{"text":"\nThis analysis reveals the connections between fractural failures and the roughness of compacted grain materials, and a statistical analysis  of Fontainebleau sandstones with various widths have been implemented. The zeta value of 0.46 + - 0.05 at different length scales showed that it is consistent with observations of other sandstones and mass produced items. Meanwhile, the exploration of the variations of height over a span yielded a unified Gaussian characteristic with no multifractal traits. Furthermore, the amplitude of the roughness does not change when the width does, thus demonstrating that no unusual scaling is present. These results are believed to be derived from brittle fracture instead of damage failure which is usually associated with a high zeta value (0.8)."}
{"text":"In the year 1874, Camille Jordan and Leopold Kronecker engaged in a contentious debate concerning the concepts (and discrepancies) of the theory of bilinear forms. Their arguments stemmed from two separate theorems that, in hindsight, appear to be identical. This article explores the polynomial practices used to manipulate forms before the onset of structural approaches to linear algebra, such as Jordan's canonical reduction and Kronecker's invariant computation methods. Through a careful analysis of the social context of the time, we can uncover tacit knowledge alongside the two internal philosophies regarding the significance of generality that exist in the background of their two opposing ideals concerning algebra and arithmetic. Consequently, this helps us create a stronger foundation for the history of linear algebra without focusing on topics related to the creation of theories or structures."}
{"text":"This pointing survey toward the central regions of 85 starless cores has been conducted\nto investigate inward motion patterns.

{"text":"\nThis article presents a detailed spectroscopic and theoretical analysis of the physical and chemical properties of the host star of TrES-2, a recently discovered transiting planet.

Mass, radius, and evolutionary age of the star were conversely estimated from the light curve analysis, the temperature, and other stellar characteristics (such as the strength of the emission in the \\ion{Ca}{2} H & K line cores and Lithium abundance). Utilizing these values, the planet's mass and radius were deduced to be $M_p = 1.198 \\pm 0.053 M_\\mathrm{Jup}$ and $R_p = 1.220^{+0.045}_{-0.042} R_\\mathrm{Jup}$, making TrES-2 the most massive nearby ($d \\lesssim 300$pc) transiting hot Jupiter."}
{"text":"\nWe analyze Hubble Space Telescope ACS data of the star-forming region NGC 346 and examine the nearby intermediate-age star cluster BS 90. The data reveals over 100,000 stars down to V ~28 mag and allows for a very detailed photometric study. By fitting isochrones to the collected data, we determine that BS 90 is 4.5 Gyr old and has a metallicity of [Fe\/H]=-0.72. Furthermore, the luminosity function suggests a present-day mass function comparable or slightly shallower than the typical Salpeter initial mass function, and the derived half-mass relaxation time of 0.95 Gyr reveals mass segregation due to the cluster's dynamical evolution. Lastly, this addition to the SMC's age-metallicity relation is compared to other star clusters within the same region."}
{"text":"\nThis article explores the effects of dimensionless parameters related to accretion disks on the magneto-rotational instability-induced turbulent transport. It is demonstrated that higher values of magnetic pressure produce a more efficient transport rate which is strongly affected by its magnetic Prandtl number. It is also determined that the dimensionless transport rate is not associated with the dimensionless linear growth rate, which challenges the current assumptions about the link between the two numbers. The findings of this paper emphasize the need for simulations to take into account the role of dissipation in order to accurately measure transport rates induced by MRI turbulence."}

Measurements and Monte Carlo simulations were conducted to analyze the level of interference caused by external gamma radiation, cosmic rays, and internal radioactive impurities. Results indicate that the observed background rate of (8.00 +- 0.07) 10^-5 counts\/cm^2\/s\/keV between 1 and 7 keV is mostly driven by gamma radiation from the surrounding environment, while cosmic neutrons and radioactive impurities are comparatively less significant."}
{"text":"\nThe objective of this research is to analyze the capability of imaging surveys of galaxies in distinguishing between dark energy and modified gravity explanations for the emergence of cosmic acceleration.

Dark energy models generally show $\\gamma \\approx 0.55$ and the DGP model is signified by $\\gamma \\approx 0.68$. We utilize the Fisher Matrix technique to assess a survey such as the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) project to determine if its observations of $\\gamma$ can be constrained to within 20%. Results from tomography help to raise the FoM, and its peak is at an exposure time of several minutes for a wide and shallow survey.

{"text":" This article investigates the characteristics of phonon transmission through epitaxial interfaces by employing lattice dynamic approach. The results indicate that the transmission characteristic is weakly dependent on frequency and is related to the symmetry of the boundary when the azimuth angle is observed. The transmission also fluctuates smoothly while the incident angle modifies. The analysis suggests the existence of a critical angle of incidence when phonons are coming to the interface between regions with larger and smaller group velocities. Aside from an incident angle near the critical value, scant mode transformations are noticed among different acoustic wave branches at the interface. The theoretical Kapitza conductance across the Si-Ge (100) interface at temperature $T=200$ Kelvin is $4.6\\times 10^{8} {\\rm WK}^{-1}{\\rmm}^{-2}$ and a scaling law $G_K \\propto T^{2.87}$ is suggested for comparatively low temperatures.

{"text":"\nRecent research has focused on analyzing patterns of collective behavior in socio-economic systems and how different choices come to be seen as popular or \"hits\". This article examines numerous popularity distributions, such as citations to scientific papers and movie gross income figures in order to understand this phenomenon. We find in the majority of cases that these distributions follow a log-normal form, which implies that underlying multiplicative stochastic processes had a significant impact. The evidence suggests that general principles of complex organization are responsible for generating popular entities. As a result, a proposed model of collective behavior is presented to explain the bimodality which can be observed in certain popularity distributions."}
{"text":"This article analyzes the geometrical aspects of quantum mechanics when the Hamiltonian is not Hermitian, yet symmetric under space-time reflection, i.e. PT-symmetric. The spectrum of associated eigenvalues of the Sturm-Liouville problem have been shown to have only real and positive energies and the basis of these eigenfunctions form an orthogonal and full set. Consequently, the probability of these quantum theories are positive and the dynamical trajectories remain unitary. This paper studies the properties of a Hilbert space consisting of a parity structure and examines the features of the PT-symmetric Hamiltonian and its eigenstates. Results indicate a connection between the PT-symmetric operator and a Hermitian operator, and how the quadratic form of the parity operator divides the Hilbert space into two halves according to states having a positive or negative PT norm. This can be solved by using a symmetry operator C in order to introduce a positive definite inner product through a CPT conjugation operation."}

This requires extremely exotic parameters concerning the underlying spacetime and the reflection geometry, and demands that the source of the reflection is far from hydrostatic equilibrium. An alternative explanation of the soft excess considers absorption from similarly partially ionised, velocity-smeared material, predominantly in the jet. Both of these models produce comparably good fits to XMM-Newton observation data, however the absorption model is preferred due to all the derived spectral indices resulting in a soft excess, which is as expected for AGN operating at a high mass accretion rate. The OM data from the simultaneous observations are used to suggest that the disk of an AGN in the very high state, like in stellar mass black holes, yields up to 80 per cent of the total accretion power. We suggest that the discrepancy between what is expected for the very high state in AGN and what is observed is due to distortions from the traditional shape of the accretion disk, echoing what is seen in stellar mass black holes."}
{"text":"This research examines the optical and X-ray data of 42 serendipitously discovered  XMM-Newton sources whose X-ray hardness ratio is higher than the average X-ray background. All of these sources have 2-4.5 keV X-ray fluxes of at least 10^-14 cgs, and their optical counterparts are all found to be extragalactic apart from one Milky Way M star which likely has negligible connection. The X-ray spectra are consistent with heavily absorbed power law emission, hinting at a population of type-2 AGN. Amongst this sample, seven sources have a distinct secondary soft X-ray component, which is consistent with the AGN unified model if > 4 per cent of broad-line AGN features an ionised absorber that reduces their soft X-ray flux by more than half. In support of this, one of the X-ray absorbed, broad-line AGN in the sample clearly has an ionised absorber."}
{"text":"\nThe electronic structure of BaFeO3 was investigated using ab initio DFT calculations. The obtained band structures, density of states, and electronic distributions along various crystalline planes were analysed. We determined that the majority spin bandgap and minority spin bandgap were 2.7012 eV and 0.6867 eV respectively. Consequently, the up spin Fe t2g states were completely occupied while the down spin Fe eg states were empty, and the up spin Fe eg and down spin Fe t2g were partially occupied at the Fermi level, leading to a finite density of states. Furthermore, efforts were taken to illustrate the association of the Fe4+-O-Fe4+ plane superexchange coupling with the arrangement of the magnetic order, as well as the link between the tetragonal displacement and possible ferroelectric properties. The charge density along the various crystalline planes was also illustrated to demonstrate the strong covalent bonding between O and Fe which can be used to understand the exchange mechanisms, and its strong hybridization may further enhance the superexchange coupling, thus increasing the magnetic ordering."}
{"text":"\nThis paper examines the accuracy of the universal Lieb-Oxford lower bound on the exchange-correlation energy, $E_{xc}[n] \\ge -C \\int d^3r n^{4\/3}$. To achieve this, we analyze available exact and nearly exact data on xc energies of atoms, ions, molecules, solids, and some model Hamiltonians. We determine that all observed physical density distributions are in line with the tighter limit of $C \\leq 1$. In addition, we find that for a variety of systems, a specific but not strictly universal bounded value can be assigned. The Lieb-Oxford bound, with a value of $C_{LO}=1.68$, is applied to the development of modern xc functionals, and for that reason any major change in the pre-factor of $C$ will affect the performance of these functionals."}
{"text":"\nMissions like ASTROD I and ASTROD, along with GAIA and LATOR, will allow us to assess relativistic gravity at a higher level of accuracy than we have yet seen, to the tune of $10^{-7}-10^{-9}$. This requires delving into second post-Newtonian approximation, which is valid till $10^{-12}$ near solar system. In this article, scalar-tensor theory is explored and its relevance to relativistic gravity testing is elaborated upon. Chandrasekhar's technique is used to weave the metric coefficients and equations of hydrodynamics in the 2nd post-Newtonian approximation, with terms inclusive of the order $O(c^{-4})$ being considered consistently within the equation of motion."}
{"text":"We have constructed an extensive 8001 square degree extinction map of the Anticenter region of the Galaxy from 2MASS. This map is provided with a resolution of 4 arcminutes, and uses the <J-H> and <H-K> colour excess maps to determine the power law index of the reddening law (\\beta) for individual regions such as Orion, Perseus, Taurus, Auriga, Monoceros, Camelopardalis, and Cassiopeia. On average, we find the dominant value of \\beta to be 1.8+-0.2, in agreement with the interstellar medium. It was also observed that there is an internal scatter in \\beta values in these regions and that some areas have more than one dominant \\beta value present, which reveals considerable variation in the dust properties. Analysis of the visual extinction (A_V) values within individual regions further demonstrates a change in the slope of the column density distribution with distance, indicating a shift in the governing physical processes in the molecular clouds. Additionally, the map hints at a possible A_V dilution with distance."}
{"text":" This article investigates a basic theorem regarding regular (a,b)-modules, which determines that a given regular (a,b)-module is entirely specified by a 'finite order jet' of its structure. A simple bound for this sufficient order is explained--in terms of rank and two basic invariants--the regularity order, which counts the number of times the operator $\\partial_z.z$ must be applied in order to achieve a simple pole (a, b)-module; and the 'width' which, in the case of a simple pole, is the largest integral difference between the eigenvalues of $b^{-1}.a$ (the logarithm of the monodromy). This theorem proves helpful in the computation of examples as it specifies up to which power of $b$ in an expansion must be taken into account to not lose any information."}
{"text":"\nThis article assesses the probability of metal enrichment in the photospheres of stars hosting planetary systems earlier than 20-30 million years by means of impacting planetesimals. Simulations of an inward-moving planet interacting with an internal disc of planetesimals then determine the rate of infalling planetesimals and assess the dependence of the planet's eccentricity and speed of migration on such a rate. Findings indicate low capture rates in mean motion resonances for fast migrations ($\\tau=10^2$yr and $\\tau=10^3$yr) and a decrease with the increase of the planet's eccentricity for slow migrations ($\\tau=10^5$yr and $\\tau=10^6$yr). Maximum metal enrichments of up to 0.18 dex have been calculated for a slowly moving 0.1-Jupiter-mass planet, even with relatively massive primitive discs. This suggests that planetary migration can explain the metal composition of exoplanets hosting hot Jupiters. "}
{"text":"This paper investigates the potential connection between zero-point energy and dark energy in a Friedman dust universe, as introduced in a preceding trilogy of works. It is found that the unequal representation of these two values as separate entities is what yields the known small dark energy value from cosmology. Topics concerning the interpretation, calculation, and measurement of such a result and a possible interpretation of dark energy as a measure of vacuum polarization are discussed. Furthermore, three appendices containing their respective abstracts are included, relating to the standard model of cosmology and redefining temperature in the dust universe model, dark matter, and a formula which provides the value of the mass of the universe in terms of Newton's gravitation constant and Einstein's Lambda."}

{"text":"\nUsing 2D hydrodynamic simulations with a detailed equation of state and neutrino transport, we explore the relationship between various non-radial hydrodynamic instabilities during the postbounce accretion phase of a collapsing stellar core. We identify a convective mode of instability characterized by the growth of typical Rayleigh-Taylor mushrooms, which is induced by negative entropy gradients caused by neutrino heating or shock variations. When the postshock region material is rapidly being advected to the gain radius, the convective instability may be suppressed; yet, oscillatory non-radial asymmetry growth (called the standing accretion shock instability) can occur. The SASI oscillation can then trigger convective instability, increasing the average shock radius and mass in the gain layer. The effect of both instabilities is an extended advection time of matter through the neutrino-heating layer, enhancing neutrino energy deposition in support of the neutrino-driven explosion mechanism. Furthermore, our simulations revealed an agreement between the oscillation period of SASI and specific features of the advective-acoustic cycle (AAC), in which pressure waves complete an amplifying feedback loop."}

This approach utilizes Euclidean geometry and its world function, \\sigma_E, in the investigation of any physical geometry, including the space-time geometry. It is capable of quantifying different aspects of multivariance to develop a comprehensive understanding of quantum effects and elementary particles through a geometrical approach. This approach also allows for the consideration of both discrete and continuous geometries using the same tools, thus offering a unified method of modeling physical phenomena to generate a better understanding of quantum theory and the world of elementary particles."}
{"text":"\nThis article investigate how neural networks implement working memory and its most likely candidate, attractor networks. After a quarter century of research into the subject, two main questions remain: can attractor networks explain the irregular firing patterns that are seen in biological systems, and how many memories can be stored under biologically realistic conditions? Using a combination of mean-field analysis, three-variable models, simulations of large networks of spiking neurons, and large scale statistics, we provide an answer to these questions. We show that if the number of neurons involved in a memory is large, irregular firing can occur, and predict that the number of memories storable can scale with the number of excitatory connections. These predictions are validated with simulations."}

{"text":"\nThis paper focuses on the radiocontinuum emission at 7 mm and the SO 2 J=19_{2,18}-18_{3,15} and J=27_{8,20}-28_{7,21} lines detected in the Cepheus A HW2 star cluster. Impressively, the SO2 images suggest the presence of a hot core that is internally heated by an intermediate mass protostar. This is paired with a circumstellar rotating disk approximately 600 AUx100 AU, with a mass of 1M_sun, which is possibly undergoing Keplerian rotation, suggesting the presence of a 9M_sun central star. However, the total luminosity observed in the region is greater than that of a 9M_sun star, implying extreme youth of this object. Sensitive radiocontinuum images also depict an extended emission to the west of the HW2 jet as well as in the south-west. This indicates that it may be photoevaporating due to the UV radiation of the central star; suggesting there is a cluster of massive stars in the area. Thus, the findings suggest that disk accretion may be the most plausible method of forming massive stars in moderate density\/luminosity clusters."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate the gravitational waves produced in collisions of dark matter-filled galactic halos. Our numerical simulations investigate the energy output and associated gravitational radiation waveforms. We observe that, for galaxies located 10 Mpc away, the amplitudes of the gravitational waves range from around $10^{-13}$ and the frequencies from around $10^{-16}$ Hz, values similar to those theorized for the waves spawned in the primordial universe. As such, the waves cannot be recorded directly by terrestrial detectors. We explore the possibility of an indirect detection via the B-mode polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background triggered by the waves. Ultimately, our results show that the imprint of gravitational waves from galaxy encounters is too weak to be observed by ongoing or upcoming missions."}
{"text":"\nResults of theoretical and experimental studies are reported concerning the magneto-optical resonance generated in Cesium vapor confined in an Extremely Thin Cell (ETC; its thickness being equivalent to the wavelength of irradiating light). The utilization of ETC enabled the evaluation of formation of a magneto-optical resonance on individual hyperfine transitions, thus separating processes resulting in dark (reduced absorption) or bright (amplified absorption) resonance production. Experimental proof of the bright magneto-optical resonance sign reversal in Cs atoms lodged in the ETC is presented. An optical Bloch equations based theoretical model was proposed, which takes into account the elastic collision of atoms in the ETC with their walls leading to the depolarization of the Cs excited state, polarized by the exciting radiation. This depolarization caused the sign reversal of the bright resonance. Using the proposed model, comparison between the theoretical and experimental outcomes of magneto-optical resonance amplitude and width with varying laser power was successfully achieved. "}
{"text":"\nThis work presents a comprehensive study of the mass distribution in the MS 2053-04 galaxy cluster, which is located at a redshift of z=0.583 and is composed of two gravitationally bound structures. By analyzing archived data from the Hubble Space Telescope, we find evidence of a double gravitational arc system. Our strong lensing model-based reconstruction of the cluster potential relies on NFW density profiles, as well as perturbations from 23 galaxies modeled as elliptical singular isothermal spheres. We predict the existence of a third image that is located near the expected position, and with the same F702W-F814W colors as the gravitational arcs. The results indicate that the cluster has a bimodal mass distribution, and they are consistent with spectrophotometric estimates. The derived mass profile was then used to calculate the mass within the arcs, and further compare it with X-ray estimates."}
{"text":"In this article, we investigate the transport properties of a system with a single unpaired electron, modeled by a nonequilibrium Kondo model. Taking advantage of the special parameter space of the Toulouse limit, we exactly calculate the adiabatically pumped spin current through the Kondo regime. We show that this provides a natural mechanism of generating a pure spin current. By examining the relevant scattering matrix of Majorana fermions in the Toulouse limit, we express this spin current as a geometrical property of the system. Combining the Keldysh Green function technique with a gradient expansion, we uncover the small parameter that determines the adiabatic limit."}
{"text":"\nInvestigations of the interstellar neutral hydrogen (HI) emission spectra have uncovered three families of linewidths, with numerical values (34, 13, and 6 km\/s) that appear to correspond to the critical ionization velocities (CIVs) of the primary atomic species present in interstellar space. An extended analysis of HI emission profiles discovers that the 34 km\/s linewidth family can be seen in local interstellar gas, unbound intergalactic clouds, and the Magellanic Stream. It is proposed that this effect, which may be associated with enhanced electron densities where rapidly moving neutral gas interacts with the surrounding medium, is manifested as a correlation between HI peaks and peaks in high-frequency radio continuum data."}
{"text":"The Cornell Caltech Atacama Telescope (CCAT) is a collaborative effort between Cornell University, the California Institute of Technology and the Jet Propulsion Lab to build a 25m telescope with a wide field of view and broad wavelength range to observe submillimeter astronomy in Chile.

The telescope is designed for large bolometer cameras with a 20 arcmin field of view and closed loop mirror control to achieve 10 mum rms of wavefront error. Instrumentation planned include short (650 mum-200 mum) and long (2mm-750 mum) wavelength bolometer cameras, direct detection spectrometers, and heterodyne receiver arrays. The University of Colorado, a Canadian university consortium, and the UK Astronomy Technology Centre will join the CCAT consortium once the telescope is complete in early in the next decade, and will be the largest, highest altitude, and most sensitive of its kind."}
{"text":"\nThe study of single-crystal TbFe3(BO3)4 has been conducted to assess its thermodynamic properties through magnetization and specific heat measurements. Magnetic fields up to 50 T and temperatures up to 350 K were applied to measure magnetization and 2-300 K with a magnetic field up to 9 T was used to measure specific heat. Structural and antiferromagnetic spin ordering phases were recorded at 192 and 40 K, respectively. The Schottky anomaly present in the specific heat data around 20 K is attributed to the splitting of two low-lying energy levels of the Tb3+ ions by f-d coupling. Magnetic fields parallel to the c-axis caused spin-flop phase transition at TN with a significant magnetization jump. The highly anisotropic character of the magnetic susceptibility is due to the Ising-like behavior of the Tb3+ ions in the trigonal crystal field. An unified approach combining mean-field approximation and crystal-field calculation is utilized to explain the experimental results."}
{"text":"\nThis article attempts to explain the mixed results on the Theta+(1530) detected in some experiments, while not seen in others. We suggest that multiquark hadrons are formed by many different quark states, and could be present in short-lived fluctuations or left over as remnants of hard processes. This notion can account for the inconsistencies between both outcomes. Moreover, new experiments which might be decisive in understanding the Theta+ can be proposed focusing on its distributions within them. Additionally, understanding multiquark hadrons might necessitate modifications of the traditional quark model with updated couplings and masses."}
{"text":"In this article, we look at a novel spin chain with nearest-neighbor interactions that falls between Heisenberg's chain and the spin chains of the Haldane-Shastry type. We demonstrate that when the number of spins is large enough, the locations of the sites and the interaction strengths can follow a Gaussian distribution. We introduce an advanced version of the freezing trick technique which helps us to precisely ascertain an array of eigenvalues and connected eigenfunctions. This is remarkable since the resultant eigenvalues are integers, hinting at the possibility of this chain being a finite-dimensional variant of the quasi-exactly solvable Schroedinger operators. Furthermore, we apply the method of moments to learn some of the statistical properties of the chain's spectrum, particularly showing that the eigenvalues follow a Wigner-type law. Finally, we emphasize that different from the original freezing trick, the improved approach developed here can be applied to spin chains whose dynamics only offer a quasi-exact solvability."}
{"text":"\nThis study presents an exploration of the dwarf irregular galaxy ESO 364-G 029 through observations of broadband optical imaging and neutral hydrogen radio synthesis. At a distance of 10.8 plus or minus 1.4 megaparsecs, ESO 364-G 029 exhibits the characteristic bar-like main body with a one-sided spiral arm, an approximately exponential light distribution and offset photometric and kinematic centers. The HI flux calculates to 23.1 +\/- 1.2 jansky kilometers per second, with a total HI mass of 6.4 +\/- 1.7x10^8 solar mass and a total HI mass-to-blue-luminosity ratio of 0.96 +\/- 0.14 solar mass per solar luminescence, blue. Although the HI distribution is mildly asymmetric and offset from the photometric center, it closely follows the optical brightness distribution and extends to beyond 1.2 Holmberg radii. The data also suggests a complex small-scale HI structure, however, further observations may be necessary to obtain a full picture. A comparison of ESO 364-G 029 to the Large Magellanic Cloud could be possible, although the HI profile of the two galaxies bears little resemblance."}
{"text":"\nA 15 ks XMM-Newton observation of the nearby Broad-Line Radio Galaxy 3C445 reveals a remarkable X-ray spectrum. The 2-10 keV continuum appears as a heavily absorbed power law of photon index Gamma ~1.4, with strong cold reflection. An Fe Kalpha emission line of 120eV equivalent width was identified. In addition, a soft excess below 2 keV was uncovered, best fitted by a power law with the same photon index as the hard power law, and with Nh=6e20 cm-2 in excess to Galactic. Furthermore, H- and He-like O, Mg, and Si emission lines have been detected, likely from a photoionized medium. Accounting for two different ionized media, or one stratified medium, produced the best description of the observed spectrum. Comparison has been made with Seyferts, which suggests that the central engines of radio-loud and radio-quiet AGN host both cold and warm gas."}

With a SIM position accuracy of 4 microarcseconds, many nearby stars could be studied, with the potential to uncover hundreds of extrasolar planets with long-period orbits. In addition, the technique enables the search for brown dwarfs and low-mass stellar companions with shorter period orbits. This detailed set of data could offer useful insight into planet formation and which planetary systems may be able to form planets in their habitable zone."}

We observe five out of the seven sub-modes to be nearly free of background, and two of these modes include two good signal candidates, albeit insufficient to consider a signal confirmed. The remaining two sub-modes, however, show no noticeable excess of events in their respective regions. The results are combined to form 90% C.L. upper limits for B(Upsilon(1S) to gamma eta) < 1.0 times 10^-6 and B(Upsilon(1S) to gamma etaprime) < 1.9 times 10^-6, exemplifying an order of magnitude improvement compared to the previous bounds, and being below the predictions in some theoretical models."}
{"text":"\nThis paper presents an improved technique called gyrochronology, which allows the measurable age of solar- and late-type main sequence stars to be determined by their rotation periods and colors. We use this gyrochronology to estimate the age of several groups of nearby late-type field stars according to their measured rotation periods. The reality of the interface sequence, which is what allows this technique to work, is validated, and its limitations and mass dependencies are detailed. We use the Sun as a calibration tool and propagate errors to understand their dependence on color and period. The median age of the stars studied by different groups of authors (Strassmeier, Pizzolato and AlphaCenAB) range from ~365 Myr to 1.2 Gyr, with a representative age uncertainty of ~15%, plus systematic errors. Our results suggest that gyrochronology is a viable tool to estimate the ages of late-type main sequence field stars, provided its limitations are taken into account."}

{"text":"\nThis paper reports the findings of a study focused on assessing the distance and neutral environment of the stellar cluster Westerlund 1. Through utilising Southern Galactic Plane Survey data for atomic hydrogen, the authors were able to explore HI absorption from the HII region connected to the cluster, as well as investigate its environment as seen in HI line emission. Using an updated Galactic rotation curve \u2013 with revised values for the distance from the Galactic centre and the velocity of the Sun around this centre \u2013 the research team derive a distance of 3.9 \u00b1 0.7 kpc to Westerlund 1, placing the cluster in the Scutum-Crux Arm. Additionally, a multitude of other elements are evaluated, including potential sources of error in the Galactic rotation curve, small expanding HI features with a maximum dynamic age of 600,000 years around the cluster, as well as a larger bubble with a minimum dynamic age of 2.5 million years. Finally, a re-evaluation of kinematic distances to nearby HII regions and supernova remnants based on the new Galactic rotation curve is presented. The authors offer the suggestion that the collective effects of stellar winds in the early stages of Westerlund 1's formation created a 50 pc bubble with a dynamic age comparable to the cluster's."}
{"text":"\nBy analyzing data from the COMBO-17 photometric redshift survey and deep Spitzer 24 micron data, this paper investigates the relationship between star formation and the visible growth of stellar mass since z=1. It is found that the integrated star formation rate is consistent with the increase in total stellar mass since z=1, and a significant portion of these newly-formed stars are in blue cloud galaxies. However, the number of massive blue galaxies (M* > 3x10^10 M_sun) with extra stars would be too large under this scenario. We propose a proposal in which the extra star formation of these blue galaxies is suppressed, resulting in their transfer to the red sequence. This process is deemed to be successful in building up the stellar mass below 10^11 M_sun."}
{"text":"\nA comprehensive analysis of particle orbits in cosmic dark matter halos has been conducted in order to extrapolate how and why baryons transform the shape of these structures. Numerical experiments which incorporated a baryonic core inside a live dark matter halo extracted from an observational sample have consistently revealed that the dissipative component is responsible for influencing nearby orbits numerous times through visits to the centre. The gravitational potential changes caused by increases in the baryonic mass can be shown to cause the frequencies of orbits to become more random, leading to a large exploration of the system's phase space that evidences itself in a more round overall configuration. This influence of the central mass on the shape of the phase space is thus seen to become weakened with increasing distance from the center. Future experiments which use analytic potentials rather than live DM halos will be necessary to further decode the dynamics of this significant phenomenon."}

Through this process, we establish the temperature-dependent heat capacity, latent heat, and helicity of alanine polypeptides consisting of 21, 30, 40, 50, and 100 amino acids. Additionally, we contrast these thermodynamical characteristics with the outcome of molecular dynamics simulations to validate the statistical mechanics approach and show its precision."}

Examples of routine angle-invariant calibration and imaging are provided, along with a flux density measure of the VLA's 74 MHz flux scale stability and an example of a wide-field image from the field-based calibration. Finally, the paper sumarizes the lessons the 74MHz system offers for new and developing low-frequency telescopes."}
{"text":"\nThis paper is devoted to investigating the relationships between functors on categories of algebras over operads and right modules over operads. We start by proving that right modules over operads give rise to functors on categories of algebras, and we demonstrate that this construction yields an embedding of categories. We then go further and show that right modules over operads form a model category. This notion allows us to investigate the correspondence between weak-equivalences of right modules and point-wise weak-equivalences at the functor level. We ultimately conclude that right modules over operads supply accurate models for the homotopy of their associated functors on algebras over operads."}
{"text":"\nIn this study, we analyze the problem of detecting a shift in the random drift of a Brownian motion in the event of two-sided alternatives. Although the 2-CUSUM stopping rules have shown superior performance for this task over the years due to their asymptotic optimality, the calculation of their first moments is complex. Our research aids in these calculations by finding closed-form expressions for the first moment of a general two-sided CUSUM stopping rule, and derived upper and lower bounds for it. We also offer an expression for the change rate of the first moment and provide upper and lower bounds. Comparisons to the extended Lorden criterion demonstrate the existence and uniqueness of the best two-sided CUSUM rule in both symmetric and non-symmetric cases. Furthermore, we suggest a modification of the conventional two-sided CUSUM stopping rule that offers improved performance in the event of small time between false alarms. Ultimately, we raise the issue of finding a strictly optimal approach in the case of two-sided alternatives."}
{"text":"\nThis study examines the kinematics and stellar characteristics of a collection of three Brightest Group Galaxies (BGGs) and three Brightest Cluster Galaxies (BCGs) that are located in X-ray emitting clusters and groups. Applying high signal-to-noise spectra originating from the Gemini\/GMOS, we compute the ages, metallicities, and abundance ratios of the sample galaxies up to their effective radii. We find that the BGGs and BCGs share similar bodies in terms of mass, central ages, and central levels of metallicity. By analyzing the variation of stellar elements over the radial parameter, we detect no substantial changes in velocity, age, or alpha-enhanced concentrations. Yet, the metallicity displayed significant scale difference, pointing to an assortment of formation mechanisms. This range of metallicity gradients opposes the unified state of the surveyed galaxies, indicating a need for more theories that would explain the origins of metallicity gradients and the general concept of galaxy formation. Ultimately, we introduce two prospective causes for the various formations mechanisms."}
{"text":"\nThis paper examines the contour process of splitting trees, in which individuals spawn i.i.d. copies of themselves with a constant birth rate, set by a general distribution over the lifetime of the individual. This birth rate is also allowed to be infinite, where the times and lifespans of the newborns form a Poisson process. The contour process is derived from a mapping from the tree to the real line, which is an order-preserving inverse process. We show that the contour process of truncated splitting trees is a L\\'evy process, reflected below a given level and killed upon hitting zero. This result is used to explore the properties of splitting trees, such as the Le Gall-Le Jan theorem, age distributions and conditionings, as well as properties of Crump-Mode-Jagers processes, such as one-dimensional marginals and limit theorems."}
{"text":"\nWe present evidence that the galaxy stellar mass-metallicity relation can be understood by computing the enrichment balance between star formation rate and gas accretion rate, along with the dilution time and blowout mass. Through our hydrodynamic simulations and analytic modeling, we uncover the nature of galactic outflows, which are strongly related to the MZR across cosmic time. By comparing three outflow models, we indicate that only the momentum-driven wind scaling reproduces the observed stellar mass-metallicity relation at z~2 in terms of its slope, amplitude, and scatter. This model supports the MZR flattening at stellar mass greater than 10^10.5 M_sun due to gas accretion rate, rather than a certain velocity, as well as a lower observed scatter through maintaining a dilution time less than one dynamical time."}
{"text":"\nThe brown-dwarf eclipsing binary 2MASS J05352184-0546085 has offered an opportunity to examine the accuracy of theoretical models of brown-dwarf formation and evolution. However, a surprising reversal of temperatures of the two brown dwarfs in the system has made current models insufficient to explain the behavior. This paper expands on previous quantifications of the basic physical attributes of 2M0535-05, thereby further strengthening the unusual temperature reversal. Our analysis shows that the reversal is likely attainable with some models if the brown dwarfs in the system are not completely coeval, possibly in accordance with the predictions of dynamical simulations. Another possibility is that the higher-mass brown-dwarf has a more potent magnetism than anticipated, which is in agreement with the recent indications of inhibited convection in observed low-mass stars. To further understand and confirm the characteristics of this binary system, further research is necessary."}
{"text":"\nThis article studies an interplanetary (IP) type-II-like radio burst which appeared on 2003 June 17-18 in connection to a fast halo coronal mass ejection (CME), an M6.8 soft-X-ray (SXR) flare, and a solar proton event. Unlike typical coronal type II bursts, this type-II-like event varied smoothly in time and frequency and had a frequency bandwidth significantly wider than the norm. Additionally, its frequency shift with time didn't fit with expectations of plasma radiation associated with a CME-driven shock. It is thus hypothesized that this so-called IP type II-S event stems not from plasma radiation, but from synchrotron radiation of near-relativistic electrons caught in the CME magnetic field or the sheath region between the shock and the CME driver. Thus, this event could be representative of an altogether new type of interplanetary radio phenomenon."}
{"text":"This paper focuses on exploring the variation in the Amati relation\u2014the correlation between the energy of a gamma-ray burst (GRB) and its peak energy\u2014with the cosmological redshift. This investigates the evolution and selection effects of 48 long-duration GRBs from Amati (2006, 2007) divided into four groups with redshifts of increasing value, with each group containing 12 GRBs. Following a fitting to the data, it was found that the parameters $a$ and $b$ of the Amati relation varied systematically with the mean redshift of the bursts. Monte-Carlo simulations demonstrated that this variation was unlikely to be to due selection bias from flux limits, adding weight to the idea that GRBs evolve strongly with increasing redshift."}
{"text":" An in-depth examination of a Lagrangian proposed by Efetov is undertaken, which was developed for the purpose of finding improvements to the Bethe approximation, a mean-field method commonly used in statistical mechanics, glasses, coding theory, and combinatorial optimization. The results demonstrate the arising of a sum over geometries similar to those used in dynamically triangulated quantum gravity. These findings bring to light new ways of designing sums over chosen geometries for the augmentation of $D$-dimensional theories' mean field approximation. These geometries tend to be locally tree-like and produce a divergence reminiscent of the one generated by quantum gravity when all topologies are combined. Expertise from dynamic triangulated quantum gravity could be used to address this. Other discovered saddle points of Efetov's Lagrangian are found to raise nonnormal and pseudo-Hermitian Hessians, a behavior unconventional of bosonic theories. To solve for this, a modified standard formula for Gaussian intergrals around nonnormal kernels was established."}
{"text":"\nIn this article, we investigate the direct CP violation in $\\bar{B}^0 \\to \\rho^0(\\omega)\\rho^0(\\omega) \\to \\pi^+\\pi^-\\pi^+\\pi^-$ with unpolarized $\\rho^0(\\omega)$s. With two $\\rho (\\omega)$ mesons in the intermediate state, the $\\rho-\\omega$ mixing process can create a great strong phase difference which can produce a large CP violating asymmetry when the masses of the $\\pi^+\\pi^-$ pairs are close to the $\\omega$ resonance. We resort to the factorization approach in calculating the hadronic matrix elements and a factor $N_c$ is included to represent the non-factorizable effects, giving an even bigger CP asymmetry (possibly 30%- 50% larger). We analyze the data of the experimental branching ratios for $\\bar{B}^0 \\to \\rho^0\\rho^0$ and $\\bar{B}^0 \\to \\rho^+\\rho^-$, providing constraint on the value of $N_c$ and prospects of very large CP violating asymmetry (in some cases more than 90%). The CP violating phase angle $\\alpha$ can also be accurately determined through the observation of the CP violating asymmetry."}
{"text":"\nThe HERMES collaboration has examined the transverse polarization of Lambda and Lambda-bar hyperons that have been created through quasireal photoproduction at an energy of 27.6 GeV on a positron beam. It was determined that the polarization of the Lambda hyperon was positive whereas the Lambda-bar isolation showed compatibility with zero. The average transverse polarization values in the accepted kinematic range at HERMES were respectively 0.078 +\/- 0.006(stat) +\/- 0.012(syst) and -0.025 +\/- 0.015(stat) +\/- 0.018(syst). This study additionally looked at the polarization levels and how for both, the polarization levels changed with the transverse momentum $p_T$ and the fraction $\\zeta$ of the beam's light-cone momentum that was carried by the hyperon. Results indicated that the Lambda polarization peaked with $p_T$ and altered in the forward\/backward regions in the $\\gamma^*N$ reaction's center-of-mass frame, pertaining to low and high $\\zeta$ values."}
{"text":"\nIn this study, we used the POLIS spectro-polarimeter located at the German VTT on Tenerife to analyze the structure of the photospheric magnetic field of a quiet Sun region near the disk center. Through Stokes spectra of the Fe I 630.15 nm and 630.25 nm lines with a 3$\\sigma$ noise level of approximately 1.8 $\\times 10^{-3} I_{c}$, it was observed that the two lines in the same spectrum had opposite polarities. This was theorized to be the result of a magnetic reconnection event occurring in the photosphere, which we confirmed through inference of a two-component model atmosphere containing a non-magnetic component, and a magnetic one containing both a lower and higher magnetic field with opposite polarities surrounded by a region of higher temperature. Although this solution is likely, it may not be the only one."}
{"text":"\nUsing a scanning magnetoresistive (MR) microscope with large spatial resolution and sensitive to magnetic fields, we have studied small variations of the magnetic field produced by imperfections in microfabricated wires and patterned magnetic films that are utilized to manipulate cold neutral atoms or Bose-Einstein condensates. Our research demonstrates that MR sensors are ideally suited for detecting minor changes in the magnetic field, which may result in the disruption of the ultracold atoms. Additionally, we verified the accuracy of our measurements against simulated magnetic fields stemming from thin, current-carrying wires with slight modifications to the edge. We found that our results closely matched the prediction of the calculations. Our study indicates that scanning MR microscopy is an efficient and reliable technique to precisely evaluate the magnetic fields near atom chips."}
{"text":"\nWe examine the impact of turbulent diffusion on the chemistry of the boundary between a dense neutral medium (CNM) cloudlet and a surrounding warm neutral medium (WNM). We utilize moving grid, multifluid, 1D hydrodynamical simulations with chemistry, featuring thermal and chemical diffusion coefficients enhanced to reflect turbulent diffusion. A rudimentary radiative transfer model is used to examine the resulting line profiles. The findings demonstrate that turbulent diffusion facilitates the expansion and warming up of the CNM as well as diminishes its contents of CH and H$_2$. H$^+$ inside the CNM is augmented, leading to augmented production of OH and H$_2$O molecules. Furthermore, diffusion causes some of the CO to leave the CNM and makes possible H$_2$ to possess contact with the warm gas, setting off production of CH$^+$, H$_3^+$, OH and H$_2$O. Higher O lines indicate extended thermal profile between the CNM and WNM. An augmented molecular abundance in the interface of the cloud enlarges molecular line profiles, further helping the excitation of intermediate energy transitions. For larger clouds, the relative molecular yield is found to be more pronounced. In conclusion, turbulent diffusion is recognized as an important element to understanding the interstellar medium (ISM) and may be a substantial factor in resolving observational problems such as the existence of warm H$_2$, CH$^+$ production, and occurrence of H$_3^+$."}
{"text":"\nIn this article, we propose a novel way to create an accelerating universe without adopting a cosmological constant. We posit that this is accomplished by taking into account Casimir vacuum energy density and a maximum momentum, consistent with quantum gravity studies, that is proportional to the Planck length. Our hypothesis further include a Planck scale correction to the energy\/momentum dispersion-relation of a FRW background. We demonstrate that these assumptions equate to a vacuum energy density which yield an accelerated universe. Simulation reveals that our model explains most observations contained in current cosmological data. We emphasize that our conclusion relies solely on general aspects of the energy-momentum dispersion-relation, and is independent of any implicit forms."}
{"text":"This article investigates methods for establishing a realistic neutrino mass texture with the current experimental data, which allows the value of one neutrino mass to be zero. The method suggests perturbing the limit in which either m_1=m_2=0 and m_3\\neq0 or m_1=m_2\\neq0 and m_3=0. By doing this, the resultant neutrino mixing matrix is found to align with the tri-bimaximal mixing pattern. This mass texture is incorporated into the minimal Type-II seesaw model with one heavy right-handed Majorana neutrino and an SU(2)_L Higgs triplet. Furthermore, it is found that this model may be able to account for the cosmological baryon number asymmetry through thermal leptogenesis. The CP-violating asymmetry of N decays is attributed to the electron flavor and is mediated by the \\Delta_L."}
{"text":"\nWe analyze the dynamical characteristics of Hamiltonian systems in multiple dimensions by examining changes in the volume of a unit deviance vector around its orbit. This volume is heavily influenced by the regularity or chaoticity of the motion, the number of deviance vectors, their linear dependency and the spectrum of its Lyapunov exponents. The fluctuating shape of this volume can be used to quickly categorize the nature of the system, leading to the development of measures that allow for a clear distinction between chaos and quasiperiodic motion on N-dimensional tori. In particular, we introduce the Generalized Alignment Index of order k (GALI$_k$), which is the volume of a generalized parallelepiped included with k initially independent unit deviance vectors of size normalized to one at each time step. This GALI$_k$ index is an extension of the Smaller Alignment Index (SALI) and provides a deeper analysis of the local dynamics. It is more efficient in distinguishing between order and chaos than SALI and can be applied even when SALI yields inconclusive results."}
{"text":"\nThis paper examines the application of the unique Dobrushin theorem in statistical mechanics to the question of cleaning a dirty floor. We present a theorem under mild assumptions on the floor's properties, which states that when a cleaning sequence is applied such that the sum of each sequence is equal to infinity everywhere on the floor, it will eventually converge to a balayage operator $\\Pi_\\Lambda$. We provide two approaches to prove this result: a simple matrix formalism, and a tree formalism, applying formal power series to the coefficients of the floor's matrix. Our study allows us to analyse the cleaning of subsets of the floor, as well as the final distribution of dirt on its complimentary set."}
{"text":"\nThis research addresses the issue of processing massive, potentially dispersed data using a new system known as DLV$^{DB}$. Recent approaches to this problem have been constrained by a few key limitations: 1) the amount of data that can be processed at once is limited by memory; 2) the concurrent interaction with exterior DBMSs is complex and, in some scenarios, not allowed altogether; 3) the number of records currently being handled is inadequate for sophisticated deductive operations using massive datasets. Tests have been conducted to compare the performance of DLV$^{DB}$ with various mainstream successor systems like LDL++, XSB, Smodels and three prominent commercial DBMSs for conventional deductive processes. Results indicate that DLV$^{DB}$ exhibits superior performance over the commercial database systems on recursive inquiries. This research has been published in the Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP)."}
{"text":"This paper assesses the application of wavelet analyses on the sphere to the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) to explore how cosmological parameters can be constrained. Statistical tests for isotropy and gaussianity of the temperature anisotropies of the CMB have been carried out, with some deviation from the expected values being detected. This hints at the existence of more exotic cosmological models to explain our universe. Spherical wavelet analyses can also be used to provide evidence for dark energy, and their effectiveness has been demonstrated by the significant detections made."}
{"text":"This paper offers a personal historical exploration of the progress of research into the mass loss and evolution of stars and star clusters from around 1965 to the present day. It addresses the current state of knowledge and understanding in this field, based on papers and discussions from a workshop on the subject. Mass loss rates have been reduced significantly due to recent FUSE observations, but scientist have yet to reconcile these results with existing radiation driven wind models. I also survey our knowledge and insights into the dissolution of star clusters in various environments, determined from measurements of mass and age distributions. Dissolution times so far have been found to be shorter than theoretical predictions based on two-body relaxation of clusters in a tidal field, and encounters with giant molecular clouds appear to explain the shorter lifetimes in the solar neighbourhood and in interacting galaxies."}
{"text":"\nThis study looks at a multi-strain epidemiological model that takes into account temporary cross-immunity. Particularly, the findings of this study are relevant in the context of dengue fever models that demonstrate deterministic chaos resulting from antibody-dependent-enhancement (ADE). By including temporary cross-immunity, it was found that a much larger range of parameter values could lead to deterministically chaotic attractors. This is especially relevant since the previously accepted parameters assumed relatively high infectivity of secondary infection, a phenomenon not supported by data from observing infected individuals. With topics such as these in mind, results from this study can have wider implications in other multi-strain epidemiological systems that include altered infectivity upon secondary infection. In addition, for dengue fever in particular, these findings open the door to more thorough analysis of existing data sets."}
{"text":"\nThis paper presents an analysis and comparison of the complexity of multiple algorithms for computing modular polynomials. We discover that an algorithm relying on modular functions, floating point evaluation, and interpolation has a near linear complexity with respect to the size of the polynomial. In particular, computing the classical modular polynomials $\\Phi_\\ell$ of prime level $\\ell$ only requires time O (\\ell^3 \\log^4 \\ell \\log \\log \\ell). Additionally, the same algorithm can be adapted to different cases, such as composite levels, polynomials between a modular function and its prime-level transformation (for example, Schl\\\"afli polynomials and generalisations). The theoretical results were confirmed by a distributed implementation of the algorithm, which successfully computed a record level modular equation of 10,0000 in two weeks using ten processors."}
{"text":"\nWe present the integration measure over the moduli space of various sorts of dyons in a pure SU(N) gauge theory at finite temperatures. This ensemble of dyons is mathematically described by a (supersymmetric) quantum field theory that can be solved exactly. We observe several remarkable characteristics: one, the free energy has a minimum corresponding to the average Polyakov line as expected in the confining phase; two, the correlation between two Polyakov lines exhibits a linear potential between static quarks in any N-ality non-zero representation with a calculable string tension largely independent of the temperature; three, the average spatial Wilson loop falls off exponentially with the area and the same string tension; four, at a critical temperature the dyons rearrange and disconfine; five, the relative ratio of the critical temperature to the square root of the string tension is in high agreement with lattice data."}
{"text":"\nThis study examines the relationship between the formation of a disk galaxy and the evolution of its metallicity gradient. To do this, we focus on the Local Group galaxy M33, conducting radiative and spectroscopic analyses of planetary nebulae, H{\\sc ii} regions, young stars and the old stellar population. A theoretical model based on the continuous accretion of gas from an external source into the disk of M33 is used to predict the time-evolution and metallicity of various chemical abundances. The model shows that a rate of gas infall close to 1 $M_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ over the past 8 billion years is able to simultaneously explain the observed rate of star formation and the shallow observed chemical gradients. This study, bolstered by the large amount of observational data now available, suggests that the metal content in M33's disk has risen with time at all radii, slowly flattening the gradient. "}
{"text":"\nA comprehensive study into the degree of ionization of the pre-star state Barnard 68 is undertaken by observing and modelling millimetric H13CO+ and DCO+ lines. Comparison to existing CO isotopologue data and modelling allows us to propose that the metal abundance is lower than 3e-9, with a standard cosmic ray input, or alternatively suggest that cosmic rays are the only source of ionization up to a few Av. Thinking on ortho\/para H2 ratios indicates a value of ~1e-2 is involved. All of this leads to an ionization fraction of 5e-9 relative to H nuclei, which is around an order of magnitude smaller than that observed in L1544. This observed ratio produces a diffusion timescale which far exceeds the freefall timescale in the core centre, suggesting that magnetically inactive regions (dead zones) may exist within protostellar disks."}
{"text":"\nBy applying a novel approach to QCD at low energies, we have obtained a complete system of equations for the quark propagator that implies quark confinement and a breakdown of chiral symmetry. We have discovered that the confining gluon propagator is a continuous linear functional in a space consisting of Green's functions for the quark propagator and corresponding quark-gluon vertex. To examine this further, we have developed a chiral perturbation theory at the quark level that enables us to find an explicit solution for the quark propagator with respect to light quark masses and inverse powers of heavy quark masses. This solution consequently has a heavy quark spin-flavor symmetry up to terms of the order $1\/m_Q^3$. As a result, we are able to gain a better understanding of the mass gap and solution of the quark confinement problem in QCD."}
{"text":"This paper investigates the response of sulfate and nitrate aerosol concentrations in PM10 to the parameters of an aerosol module within the framework of Model Inter-Comparison Study (MICS) Asia Phase II. A reference configuration resulted in a comparison of aerosol concentrations in two models. Single variations were then assessed against this reference, such as size distribution, physical processes and various emissions \u2013 with a focus on how these modifications respond to concentrations in PM10. Results yielded little effect from sea-salt emissions but higher sensitivity to heterogeneous reactions, while nitrate was found to be insensitive to cloud chemistry. Finally, investigating the variability of the models, the response of sulfate concentrations was seen to be lower than that of a Chemistry Transport Model, whereas the response of nitrate concentrations was found to be of similar magnitude to the model."}
{"text":"\nThis article analyses the prompt and afterglow emission of GRB 050410 and GRB 050412, two bursts detected by Swift with no observed optical counterparts. Our analysis examined the 15-150 keV energy distribution of the GRB 050410 prompt emission, which revealed a peak energy at 53 keV, as well as the XRT light curve, the spectrum, and the GRB 050412 afterglow. Although both bursts had tight upper limits for the optical emission, neither of them could be definitively deemed 'dark' GRBs. For GRB 050410, this could be due to the relatively low density of the interstellar medium surrounding the burst, while it was more difficult to determine in GRB 050412 due to the ambiguity in the extrapolation of the X-ray afterglow light curve."}
{"text":"\nWe analyse a sample of stars from both field stars and the well-studied open cluster IC 4651 with diverse spectroscopic methods to identify their physical parameters. We use a line-depth ratio (LDR) based technique to precisely calculate the effective temperatures, which we compare to those obtained through a classical LTE abundance approach. (i) For the field stars, the LDR-determined temperatures are found to be strongly in accordance with the temperatures assessed by a spectral synthesis; proving that spectra actually provide us with population characteristics such as mass and age. (ii) For IC 4651, we derive a reddening value of E(B-V) = 0.12 \u00b1 0.02, independent from the employed colour-temperature calibration, an age of 1.2 \u00b1 0.2 Gyr, and further a mean mass of 2.0 \u00b1 0.2 M_sun for the examined giants. Additionally, we detect a systemic difference of around 0.2 dex for the log g between the derived spectroscopic and evolutionary values. Ultimately, we determine that, despite the limitations, spectroscopic treatments of giant stars essentially lead to dependable stellar parameters\u2014while the magnitude of consistency essentially hinges on the details of the adopted spectroscopic approach."}
{"text":"\nThe PVLAS collaboration recently reported an unexpected observation of a rotation of linearly polarized laser light induced by a transverse magnetic field. Two proposed mechanisms to explain this phenomenon are the production of a single light neutral spin-zero particle or pair production of light minicharged particles. In this article, we focus on a class of models that involve not only the visible photon, but also light ``hidden paraphotons'' and light paracharged particles, which mix kinematically with the visible one. These models are able to evade strong astrophysical and cosmological bounds on the weakly interacting light particles. We analyze the upcoming laboratory based tests of the particle interpretation of the PVLAS anomaly, which, exploiting high fluxes of low-energy photons and\/or large electromagnetic fields, will search for previously unconstrained parameter space of the discussed models."}
{"text":"\nUsing data collected by the GAMMA experiment, an exhaustive air shower (EAS)\ninverse approach was undertaken to explore the energy spectra and component\nstructure of cosmic ray primaries within a rigidity range of 1-100 PeV.

{"text":"\nBy studying the distribution of sources on color-color diagrams at extreme detection depths of A_K ~ 7 (A_V ~ 59 mag) in the dark cloud core Barnard 59, we used combined near-infrared data from ground-based imagers and mid-infrared data from the Spitzer Space Telescope to calculate A_\\lambda\/A_K as a function of \\lambda between 1.25 and 7.76 micron. This reveals a different regime of extinction law than the extrapolation of the near-infrared power law curve, more closely agreeing with the dust model of a cloud with R_V=5.5 and larger grains than those in the ISM. The slopes in the diagrams were less steep than those from a previous study of lower column density clouds, suggesting that the extinction law between 3 and 8 microns might vary due to the environment."}
{"text":"This paper investigates the role of renormalization in quantum gravity using the techniques of J. Polchinski, which include the use of flow equations for operations like perturbative renormalization. It then extends these techniques to effective field theories with a UV cutoff. This is done by establishing a set of renormalization conditions that are restricted to nonrenormalizable couplings. It is shown that in this context, nonrenormalizable theories can be studied without problems. The paper further applies this to the standard covariant BRS quantization program for Euclidean quantum gravity, using a momentum cutoff regularization and discussing the resulting violation of the Slavnov-Taylor identities. It is then explored how the predictivity of the effective quantum gravity at scales far below the Planck scale can be tested with flow equations and a fine-tuning procedure is proposed. Lastly, the paper considers the no-cutoff limit of Euclidean quantum gravity in light of the Polchinski\u2019s method and speculates whether a limit with a non-vanishing gravitational constant might exist, one that is ultimately determined by the cosmological constant and the mass of elementary particles."}
{"text":"\nThis paper introduces ECHO, a high-order shock-capturing numerical code for 3D General Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) and Magnetodynamics (GRMD). It is designed to allow for different equations and algorithms, as well as for a generic space-time metric so that it can be easily coupled with any solver for Einstein's equations. ECHO employs a range of high-order reconstruction methods and a two-wave approximate Riemann solver, and incorporates the Upwind Constrained Transport (UCT) procedure to preserve the divergence-free condition of the magnetic field. The GRMD mode is implemented by simply replacing the fluid velocity with the electromagnetic drift velocity and dropping the matter contribution to the stress tensor. We demonstrate that ECHO is highly accurate, efficient, versatile, and robust through several astrophysical simulations, such as a novel test of the propagation of large amplitude circularly polarized Alfven waves, which confirmed the accuracy of reconstruction with a Monotonicity Preserving filter applied to a fixed five-point stencil for both flat and curved metric up to the nominal fifth order. Moreover, the results also showed that the code maintains sharp profiles in tests involving discontinuities."}
{"text":"\nWe explore the possibility of Coulomb drag between two graphene sheets in both intrinsic and extrinsic systems. Using diagrammatic perturbation theory, we derive the appropriate expression for single-layer graphene systems and find a closed form zero-temperature solution. Whilst an intrinsic graphene layer exists, Coulomb drag between them is effectively nullified. With extrinsic systems, we obtain numerical results as well as an approximate analytical expression for the drag resistivity $\\rho_\\textrm{D}$. It shows that $\\rho_\\textrm{D}$ is proportional to $T^2$, $1\/d^4$ for large interlayer separation  $d$ and $1\/n^3$ for high carrier densities $n$. Additionally, we examine plasmon-induced enhancement to Coulomb drag, predicting it to be prominent near the Fermi temperature."}
{"text":"\nIn this article, a new ergodic model is discussed which can be used to shed light on the transition from hydrodynamic-like to Coulomb-explosion for the collisionless expansion of spherical nanoplasmas. Detailed steps for deriving the model and addressing the initial charging transient due to electron expansion with immobile ions are presented. By contrasting the expansion using different kinetic models, the ergodic model is found to be able to achieve an overall simplified description while retaining information on the electron distribution and its energy spectrum. Relevant results based on a wide range of initial conditions accurately match those generated by the exact Vlasov-Poisson theory, thereby providing an exhaustive characterization of all stages of the expansion."}
{"text":"\nThis paper proposes a Markov chain-based approach to multiple pattern matching for the statistical estimation of RNA motifs and their abundance in genomewide searches. After introducing the relevant concepts from automata theory, generating functions and transfer matrix methods, a general framework is established for analysing the occurrences and frequency of patterns in strings generated by a random, memoryless source. With the help of automata for recognizing complex patterns, the applications of this approach are demonstrated through the concept of automata synchronization and through the ability to locate a finite number of keywords (including patterns constructed according to base pairing rules) in general texts."}
{"text":"\nRecent X-ray observations from the INTEGRAL satellite have shown an abundance of transient X-ray sources showing outbursts of short duration (~ tens of minutes) with extremely fast rise times. Since many of these sources are linked to OB supergiants, a new class of massive X-ray binaries has been coined Supergiant Fast X-ray Transients. Characteristics of their related counterparts have been studied, with the majority of them being late O and early B supergiants of various luminosities and at various distances. Although their optical properties appear to be similar to classical Supergiant X-ray Binaries, the detection of outbursts from persistent supergiant systems hints at the possibility of a continuum between them. This could lead to further exploration of the physical causes of these outbursts."}
{"text":"This article examines the P2P IPTV traffic structure and the potential effects on the Internet. Through an in-depth measurement campaign conducted during the 2006 FIFA World Cup, the authors analyze the download and upload characteristics of the most popular P2P IPTV applications (PPLive, PPStream, SOPCast and TVAnts). Results from the wavelet-based transform method employed demonstrate the periodic behavior of the TCP traffic and stationary UDP property, which introduces long-range dependence to the traffic. Additionally, their findings indicate that the signaling traffic has a considerable effect on the download while having less of an impact on the upload. To properly construct accurate P2P IPTV traffic models, it is crucial to consider both sides of the traffic and its granularity."}
{"text":"\nThis paper presents the results from an optical spectroscopic investigation of the two long-period, massive binaries HD 37366 and HD 54662. Our analysis reveals HD 37366 to be a double-lined spectroscopic binary with a period of 31.8187 +\/- 0.0004 days, the primary of which is an O9.5 V star. Additionally,tomographic reconstruction of the individual spectra enabled us to ascertain the nature of its secondary to be an early B-type main sequence star. HD 54662 is also a double-lined binary with a period of 557.8 +\/- 0.3 days, and while tomographic reconstruction was not possible, we present mean spectra suggesting the secondary is approximately half as bright as its primary. Model spectral energy distributions and galactic reddening curves were fitted to determine the angular sizes of the stars, which in conjunction with estimated radii suitable for both classifications, produce distance ranges of 1.4 - 1.9 kpc and 1.2 - 1.5 kpc for HD 37366 and HD 54662, respectively. Both stars thus make excellent targets for long baseline optical interferometric studies."}
{"text":"\nThe absolute Galois group Gal(Qbar\/Q), which is the group of field automorphisms of the algebraic closure Qbar of Q that leave the field Q fixed, does not in general preserve the invariants of corresponding holomorphic objects. However, the situation is different for the case of covers of the projective line branched only over the 0, 1 and infinity points, as per Belyi's theorem which is part of Grothendieck's 'dessins d'enfants' program. Inspired by Catanese's question about a higher dimensional analogue to this, this paper establishes that the absolute Galois group acts faithfully on the irreducible components of the moduli space for smooth surfaces of general type and with a canonical polarization. Recent work by Bauer, Catanese and Grunewald has additionally proven Catanese's original question."}
{"text":"\nAn XMM-Newton X-ray observation of the Wolf-Rayet binary system WR 147 was conducted for 20 ksec. It revealed that the system is made up of a nitrogen-type WN8 star with an OB companion and their respective winds are interacting in the form of a colliding wind shock. The X-ray spectra showed evidence of a high extinction in IR studies and hot plasma including the first detection of an Fe K-alpha line complex at 6.67 keV. Spectral fits with a constant-temperature plane-parallel shock model estimated the shock temperature as kT(shock) = 2.7 keV [T(shock) ~ 31 MK]. Optically thin plasma models suggest even higher temperatures, which are yet to be fully explored. The X-ray spectra are harder than anticipated by the numerical colliding wind shock models. This could be due to underestimates of wind speeds and abundances, overly simplistic models, or the presence of other X-ray emission mechanisms. Improvements in the numerical models, including non-equilibrium ionization, are needed for testing the colliding wind interpretation."}
{"text":"\nAn investigation of IRAS06468-0325 has uncovered an unusual phenomenon with a bright point-like source (the diamond) and a distinct ring-like structure (the ring). Optical imaging from I to L' has illustrated the presence of both components and the infrared colours of the diamond convey evidence of its youth. Analysis of the CO and CS lines of the source that yield a kinematic distance of 3 kpc supports the inference of this being a multiple stellar system in a transient stage, with the sharpness of the ring possibly a result of tidal truncation from the interactions between components. This peculiar object may provide insight into the brief process of binary or multiple star formation."}
{"text":"\nWe examine the optical line emissivity of Brightest Cluster Galaxies (BCGs) taken from the National Optical Astronomy Observatory (NOAO) Fundamental Plane Survey (NFPS) and the C4 catalogue of optically-selected clusters from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 3 (SDSS DR3). Our objective is to gain an understanding of how optical line emission in BCGs are associated with the characteristics of the galaxy and host cluster. We compare the optical line emissions of the BCGs to a control sample comprising the other bright galaxies near the cluster core. Overall, both the NFPS and SDSS demonstrate a small proportion of BCGs with line emissions with no observable pattern in relation to the mass of the galaxy or velocity dispersion of the cluster. However, we found that the fraction of BCGs with emission lines is much higher for those situated in cooling flow clusters, up to 100% within 50kpc of the X-ray centre. Excluding cooling flow clusters, only 10% of BCGs exhibited line emission, similar to the control sample of galaxies. We determined that the source of the line activity changed from case to case; some had line ratios like those of a LINER while others featured a blend of star formation and LINER activity. We concluded that the presence of optical line emissions in BCGs is linked to the cooling of X-ray gas near the cluster centre."}
{"text":"\nIn this analysis, three Free Core Nutation (FCN) models, MHB2000, Malkin's and Lambert's, are examined for their representation of changes in the amplitude and phase of FCN. The model of the author provides the most accurate result, although the models are based on only a single FCN rotational mode. According to the results of VLBI observations conducted over the past couple of years, two close FCN periods could be present. G. Krasinsky's ERA2005 theory explains the presence of the second FCN frequency. To look deeper into this phenomenon, the IVS time series of celestial pole offsets, as well as those predicted by the ERA2005 theory, are explored using statistical methods. These methods indicate the presence of two fluctuations in the nutational movement of the Earth's rotation axis with periods of approximately -452 and -410 solar days."}
{"text":"\nThe comparison of virial masses with those derived from millimeter observations have been used to investigate the mass of giant molecular clouds in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), an area with a lower concentration of metals. It was discovered that masses derived from millimeter emission are consistently higher than those deduced from CO data cubes. The average difference was around twice the mass predicted through virial assumptions. Changes in dust properties could not account for the difference, however a magnetic field strength of ~15 micro Gauss may be able to explain the discrepancies. This suggests that magnetic pressure contributes substantially more to SMC clouds than previously assumed and as a result, their masses have been underestimated."}
{"text":"\nThe distributions of the spacing s between nearest-neighbor levels of unfolded spectra of random matrices from the beta-Hermite ensemble (beta-HE) are analysed via Monte Carlo simulations. These matrices are real-symmetric and tridiagonal and their reciprocal of temperature (beta) can assume any positive value through the classical electrostatic interpretation of eigenvalues. Results show that generalized gamma distributions are excellent fits for the nearest-neighbor spacing (NNS) distributions for any given beta and still remain straightforward. They encompass the level repulsion when s becomes close to zero, as well as the overall shape of NNS distributions in the region easily accessed by experiments or numerical simulations. The exact NNS distribution of the GOE (beta=1) meets with a better description through a generalized gamma distribution than via the Wigner surmise, while the highest generalized gamma approximation coincides essentially with the Wigner surmise when beta is higher than approximately two. Brody distributions were obtained from both as-calculated eigenvalues and unfolded eigenvalues of matrices from the beta-HE in the form of their minimum NN spacing."}
{"text":"\nTemperature dependent impedance spectroscopy is employed to separate and study the dielectric and resistive properties of multiferroic epitaxial thin films such as BiFeO3 (BFO) and BiMnO3 (BMO). It is revealed that the film capacitance is comparable to that of the electrode interface, which affects the analysis of capacitor efficiency depending on layer thickness. Additionally, non-Debye impedance response is modeled using Gaussian distributions of relaxation times and shows that traditional conductivity measurements on multiferroic layers may be hindered by interface influences. Thermal charge transfer models then induce activation energies of 0.60 eV +- 0.05 eV (BFO) and 0.25 eV +- 0.03 eV (BMO), which suggest conduction driven by oxygen vacancies (BFO) and electron jumping (BMO). Their intrinsic film dielectric constants were also determined to be 320 +- 75 (BFO) and 450 +- 100 (BMO)."}
{"text":"\nThis study investigated the effect of beta-dystroglycan processing on the attachment of utrophin and the short dystrophin isoform, Dp116, in both normal and mdx Schwann cell membranes. Activation of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) was found to be higher in the mdx nerve and this led to an accumulation of the 30 kDa isoform of beta-dystroglycan and an effect on the assembly of Dp116 and utrophin to the cell membrane. Results of the study demonstrated increased affinity of Dp116 to the full length form of beta-dystroglycan while the Up71 isoform of utrophin had greater attachment to the 30 kDa form of beta-dystroglycan, potentially stabilizing it at the membrane. The participation of the short utrophin isoform and the presence of cleaved beta-dystroglycan in mdx Schwann cell membrane architecture were highlighted by the findings."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate the correlations between rotation and activity during pre-main-sequence (PMS) stellar evolution by analyzing an extensive set of optically high-resolution spectra of 74 F-M dwarfs in a range of young stellar associations ages 6 to 30 Myr. We observe a clear decline in chromospheric activity as the stars evolve from T Tauri to main sequence stars. Using activity as an age indicator and stellar radii from evolutionary models, we find a consistent age range of 10-40 Myr for the Tuc-Hor association, and 13 (7-20) and 9 (7-17) Myr for the Eta Cha and TWA associations, respectively. Our results indicate angular momentum is conserved between 5-30 Myr and that the rotation-activity relation for young stars is not correlated to lower-rotators like main-sequence stars, likely due to a different magnetic field generation mechanism. In short, we find observed stellar radii are in agreement with predicted radii within +\/- 15% over this PMS evolutionary period."}
{"text":"\nThrough this study, we investigate the mass profiles of 10 quasar strong lensing galaxies. Five of the galaxies have density profiles that are similar to $r^{-2}$ while the other five are close to $r^{-1}$, which is similar to the NFW profile. The former lens samples are mainly isolated early-type galaxies with higher stellar mass, while the latter ones are either in clusters or have a high mass-to-light ratio, indicating that they are dominated by dark matter. Furthermore, the same models give an estimated value for the Hubble constant ($H_0$) of 64 $\\pm$ 9 (km\/s)\/Mpc. To determine accuracy, the same model was applied to simulated lenses from cosmological hydrodynamic simulations and it was observed that the calculated $H_0$ and radial density profiles were consistent with the expected results. This implies that several recent studies that suggested low values for $H_0$ and profiles much steeper than $r^{-2}$ may have used an inappropriate modeling approximation. Additionally, our analysis demonstrates that perturbations of an isothermal lens can lead to changes in time-delays at a zeroth order."}
{"text":"This study introduces a proposed solution for driving efficient 2D path calculations with a single-layer excitable CNN model. The model is composed of regionally bistable cells that can produce propagating trigger autowaves, while also having the capability of mapping obstacle distributions in 2D space to the cell array. By combining these features, the proposed network can be utilized as the main component in a 2D path computer. Detailed numerical experiments have been conducted and circuit level parameters, as well as performance estimations, were presented. Additionally, the study explores alternative technology and device level implementations which may be applicable for autonomous processor designs for micro or nanoscale robotic applications."}
{"text":"\nIn this paper, we study the dependence of night-side temperature on opacity on short-period extra solar gas giant planets, through a three-dimensional radiative hydrodynamical numerical scheme that considers rotationally modified flows and accurately treats radiation transfer between optically thin and thick regions. Employing a suite of numerical simulations, we demonstrate that night-side temperature is a strong indicator of opacity; higher opacities cause greater day-night temperature differences, while opacities diminished by grain growth and sedimentation lead to more even temperatures across the planet's photosphere. Additionally, we propose a four-zone model to explain this observed relationship. This work marks the first in a series of studies that aim to characterize the atmospheric dynamics of extra solar gas giants."}
{"text":"\nA study of hadronization involving semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering (SIDIS) has been conducted through measurements of hadron multiplicities on deuterium, helium, neon, krypton, and xenon targets using the HERMES detector at DESY with an electron or positron beam of 27.6 GeV energy. The results of this investigation, R_A^h, show a decrease of hadron multiplicities on nucleus A relative to those on the deuteron, with an A-dependence following an A^{\\alpha} form with \\alpha \\approx 0.5-0.6. In addition, R_A^h was found to increase with the virtual-photon energy \\nu and the fraction z of this energy transferred to the hadron; the photon virtuality Q^2 was seen to have little effect, with the exception of a slight rise in R_A^h. In the case of pions, two-dimensional distributions indicate that the dependence of R_A^{\\pi} on \\nu and z can largely be described by a combination of these variables called L_c; furthermore, an increase of R_A^{\\pi} at large p_t^2 suggests a partonic energy-loss mechanism is present."}
{"text":"\nUsing current cosmological data and predicting the expected sensitivity from the upcoming Planck satellite, we examine the implications of various classes of particle physics models that input new light scalar fields and propose constraints on neutrino mass and neutrino interactions. We observe that SDSS Main sample data in combination with WMAP and other data disfavors the scenario of three coupled neutrinos with a confidence level of 3.5$\\sigma$, while SDSS Large Red Galaxy data allows it within 2$\\sigma$. Conversely, Planck only allows a single freely streaming neutrino with a minimum of 4.2$\\sigma$ confidence. The increased sensitivity to neutrino free-streaming implies Planck will be able to probe a wide range of Mass-Varying Neutrino parameters and determine the total radiation of the CMB epoch to an accuracy of $\\Delta N_\\nu^{eff} = ^{+0.5}_{-0.3}$ ($1\\sigma$ errors). In addition, it can detect a neutrino mass generation scale as high as 1 TeV."}
{"text":"\nThis paper presents a novel approach to the SM of particle physics and the Feynman-Weinberg theory of quantum gravity in order to provide a unified theory of everything. It examines the implementation of cosmological boundary conditions that make the theory finite, in order to eliminate the divergence infinities normally 'renormalized away'. Additionally, this approach resolves various cosmological issues, such as the horizon, flatness and isotropy problems, and explanes a scale-free, Gaussian, adiabatic perturbation spectrum. The quantum mechanical requirement of a Planckian spectrum in the initial state of the $SU(2)_L$ gauge field implies that if the field has managed to survive thermalization until this day, it will explain the observed dark matter and dark energy. There is also a possibility that the $SU(2)_L$ nature of the CMBR has been seen in the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect. This paper suggests several experiments that can be used to test the hypothesis."}
{"text":"The fast-changing TeV gamma-ray emission detected in M 87 has constrained the range of assumptions about the origin of this radiation. This paper proposes the possibility that the TeV radiation is produced by inverse Compton emission of ultra-relativistic electron-positron pairs which develop in an electromagnetic cascade in the magnetosphere of the supermassive black hole. Detailed numerical calculations of particle acceleration and radiation in the magnetospheric vacuum indicate that this \"pulsar-like magnetosphere\" scenario can explain the main characteristics of M 87's TeV gamma-ray emission."}
{"text":"\nWe explore an 8$\\degr$ diameter field near the North Galactic Pole that hosts the Coma Cluster of galaxies. Our deep observations at 0.4 GHz are a first-time combination of the NAIC Arecibo 305-m telescope in Puerto Rico and the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory at Penticton, Canada. This distinctive technique makes it possible to detect radio emissions on 8$\\degr$ to 3$\\arcmin$ scales, out to the 100 Mpc distance of the ``Great Wall''. Patches of weak, previously unseen diffuse radio glow have been discovered and could originate either from the intergalactic IGM magnetic fields in the range 0.2 to 0.4 $\\mu$G on scales of roughly 4 Mpc, or possibly from Galactic ``cirrus''. The observed anticorrelation between low-level radio glow and some regions of increased optical galaxy surface density implies that diffuse synchrotron radiation is more indicative of IGM magnetic and Cosmic ray energy density than baryonic (or dark) matter density. In addition, these diffuse arcminute-level structures over a sizable celestial region can be used to map foreground radiation for the Cosmic Microwave Background."}
{"text":"This article examines the residual correlations between the decay products of $\\pi^0\\pi^0$ and $p\\Sigma^0$ systems due to both correlations emerging from the small relative velocities and small decay momenta of the parents. Analyses of this phenomenon suggest that the understanding of such residual correlations may provide a novel method of obtaining information regarding a direct photon fraction. Predictions based on the spin-flavour SU$_6$ model indicate that the residual correlation of $p\\gamma_{\\Sigma^0}$ is concentrated at $k^* \\approx 70$ Mev\/$c$ and its intensity is sensitive to the scattering parameters and space-time dimensions of the source. Whereas, the residual correlation of $p\\Lambda_{\\Sigma^0}$ recovers the negative parent $p\\Sigma^0$ correlation for $k^* > 70$ Mev\/$c$. Therefore, the neglect of this negative correlation may cause an overestimation of the source size."}
{"text":"\nThis paper proposes an approach to overcoming the issue of 'curse of boundary nodes' in selfish packet-forwarding wireless networks, which is caused by lack of incentives for nodes on the edge of a network to forward packets for each other. This approach relies on a coalition game model that accounts for cooperative transmission from the boundary nodes so that the backbone nodes in the middle of the network can be persuaded to forward packets for them accordingly. Additionally, the paper examines the stability of coalitions using the concept of core and applies two types of fairness - min-max fairness using nucleolus and average fairness using Shapley function. Simulation results validate the implementation of the protocol, demonstrating how boundary nodes and backbone nodes form coalitions that comply with various fairness criterions, while improving the connectivity of the network as much as 50%, compared to the outcomes of pure repeated game schemes."}
{"text":"This study looks beyond the horizon, exploring the phenomenon of causality, acoustic metrics, and the redshift of sound signals. We show that, by introducing a Born-Infeld type scalar field, it is possible to send information from inside a black hole. This is accomplished by perturbations of the field propagating in a non-trivial scalar field background, which serves as a \"new ether.\" As this theory breaks Lorentz-invariance spontaneously, superluminal speeds of sound signals is possible. In addition, we examine a stationary solution for a background which describes the accretion of a scalar field onto a black hole and the subsequent escape of perturbations through the Schwarzschild horizon. As a result, this can grant observers outside the black hole access to information hitherto unreachable."}
{"text":"\nA comprehensive model has been developed to simulate the charging process of the ASTROD I test mass due to cosmic rays and solar particles. Utilizing GEANT4 and a simplified geometrical model, it has been estimated that the test mass will charge positively at a rate of 24 +\/-7 e+\/s during solar minimum. These results have been used to determine the magnitude of disturbances caused by the charging process on the test mass's geodesic motion, accounting for uncertainties in the model and potential contributions from secondary cosmic-ray components."}
{"text":"\nThis paper examines the orbital magnetization and its consequences on the thermoelectric transport and magnetization features of a two-dimensional Kagome lattice with spin anisotropy present. In addition to a conventional term, the orbital magnetization consists of a correction made by a Berry phase in the Bloch electrons' semi-classical dynamics. We demonstrate that there is an opposition in behavior between the two orbital magnetization pieces; $M_{c}$ and $M_{\\Omega}$ displaying a paramagnetic and diamagnetic response respectively. We also show that change in the spin chirality parameter $\\phi$ has a profound effect on the orbital magnetization property, further demonstrating the peculiarity of its behavior depending on whether the system is in a metallic or insulating region. Finally, the anomalous Nernst conductivity is computed and gives distinct peak-valley structure when the electron Fermi energy is changed."}
{"text":"\nWe explore the straggler identification problem, an algorithm which can determine the identities of elements that remain in a set after a multitude of insertion and deletion operations. It must be done in o(n) space, where n is the total number of identities. This problem has utility in determining unacknowledged packets in a high-bandwidth multicast. We demonstrate a deterministic solution that requires O(d log n) bits and involves a novel application of Newton's identities for symmetric polynomials. This can recognize any subset of d from a set of n O(log n)-bit identifiers, if there are no false deletions of identities not already present. We present a lower bound argument to support that any small-space deterministic solution cannot guarantee false deletions. An alternative randomized solution is offered, which requires O(d log n log(1\/epsilon)) bits and can manage a multiset and address the straggler identification problem even with false deletions. This is based on an invertible Bloom filter."}
{"text":"\nWe explore how microorganisms can adjust their growth rate in response to varied environmental conditions even when they possess a limited number of signal transduction networks. We reveal that when the gene expression of growing cells are subject to random fluctuations, a self-adjusting cellular state is automatically chosen due to its resistance against noise-related disruptions. Changes in protein concentration within cells is a function of growth rate and is dictated by synthesis minus dilution and degradation. At a higher growth rate, these two parameters are in balance, leading to increased tolerance toward noise. In contrast, states with low growth rates are more prone to noise-induced deviation. Our simulations demonstrate the emergence of an adaptive state with a high growth rate that does not rely on particular signal transduction mechanisms. Therefore, this newly established generic process could explain a wide range of cellular adaptive responses, such as metabolic flux optimization for maximum cell growth."}
{"text":"\nThe electronic structure of La$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$NiO$_{4}$ with x=1\/3 and 1\/2 has been studied to investigate the charge and spin stripe order. For x=1\/3, the results from LSDA+U calculations show that the system is an insulator and has both the charge and spin stripe structure, consistent with experimental findings. With x=1\/2, an exact diagonalization of a multi-orbital many body Hamiltonian derived from LDA, including on-site and inter-site Coulomb interactions, yields a ground state of an insulator with an energy gap of 0.9eV and charge and spin stripe order. It was found that the on-site Coulomb interaction is essential to ensure integral valency of each Ni ion, though it does not directly trigger the charge order. Instead, the inter-site Coulomb interaction and the anisotropy of hopping integrals are both pertinent to the structure of charge and spin stripe order in the system."}
{"text":"\nThis paper explores a technique for deriving full, effective dissipative and stochastic interactions in mesoscopic simulations by utilizing force covariance. We demonstrate that a combination of the radial distribution function and a force covariance function can be employed to ascertain all interactions in dissipative particle dynamics. Examining the effectiveness of the method, we use the force covariance approach to assess whether the effective interactions of dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) are suitable to reflect the projection of a microscopic Lennard-Jones simulation. Our findings signify that, while the DPD model may correctly reproduce equilibrium behavior, it is not aligned with the underlying microscopic dynamics. We also comment on the connection of this outcome to results from other technical research in literature."}
{"text":"In this article we consider the CP-violating ratio of epsilon'\/epsilon within the Littlest Higgs model with T-parity and look at associated correlations with three rare K decay rates - K_L -> pi^0 nu {bar nu}, K_L -> pi^0 l^+ l^- and K^+ -> pi^+ nu {bar nu}. Our research indicates that the correlation between these decays and epsilon'\/epsilon is substantial for K_L but not so pronounced for K^+ -> pi^+ nu {bar nu}. We additionally present an updated SM prediction of epsilon'\/epsilon, based on gluon and electroweak penguin matrix elements, and the m_s^MS(2 GeV) from lattice QCD. It is found that with this theory, significant improvements cannot be seen in the K_L decays, even with a factor of five increase in the rate for K^+ -> pi^+ nu {bar nu}. But small changes in the hadronic matrix elements may lead to consistent predictions between the LHT model and epsilon'\/epsilon, resulting in notable improvements in both K_L -> pi^0 nu {bar nu} and K_L -> pi^0 l^+ l^- yet minor modification in the rate for K^+ -> pi^+ nu {bar nu}."}
{"text":"This article examines the relationship between the star-to-star abundance variations of light nuclei and hydrogen burning in the case of Galactic globular clusters (GCs). A detailed nuclear reaction network and state of the art nuclear rates will be used to answer questions concerning the self-enrichment scenario of globular clusters. Through calculations at constant temperature, the parameters determining the observed extreme abundances of the elements in the typical case of NGC6752 are able to be narrowed down. This agreement is achieved through mixing of the hydrogen-processed material with up to thirty percent of unprocessed gas. Possible polluters such as massive Asymptomatic Giant Branch stars and massive main-sequence stars are discussed in terms of the temperatures needed for hydrogen-burningconstraints set by observations of Oxygen, Sodium, Magnesium and Aluminum. Lastly, this research shows that Li production by stars creating the other abundance anomalies may not be necessary for NGC 6752."}
{"text":"\nThis article continues an earlier exploration of how close supernova remnants (SNR's) influence local cosmic-ray (CR) habitats. Modern research updates this inquiry by accounting for a more realistic model of CR dispersal throughout the Galaxy. Analyses revealed that the vertical boundary $H$ on local SNR CR effects was negligible when $H$ exceeded 2kpc. Considering the numerous current values for $H$, investigations of the effects of local CR sources can continue to be based on three-dimensional, unbounded models. The author further evaluated if a single, undiscovered, but very old SNR---with an approximate age of $1.5 \\times 10^5$ years and located 0.57kpc from the Sun----could explain the anisotropy of particles below the knee."}
{"text":"\nThe study explored the pulsation and modulation properties as well as the connection between them in RR Gem over a timespan of 70 years. A detailed analysis of the light curves, maximum brightness and O-C data was conducted. It was found that RR Gem was mostly modulated, with the total 'power' of the modulation changing over the observed time period. Changes in the modulation and pulsation periods were also observed and displayed a ratio of 1.6 +\/- 0.8 * 10^3. As well as this, small changes in the mean maximum brightness and pulsation amplitude were detected."}
{"text":"\nThis article focuses on the behavior of the intersection points of a fixed planar curve $\\Gamma$ with the nodal set of a translationally invariant, isotropic random field $\\Psi(\\bi{r})$. We examine the properties of the resulting discrete point process, such as repulsion, rigidity, and two-point correlation. Using these statistical measures, we aim to quantify the patterns created by the nodal networks of different types of random waves, as well as the eigenfunctions of chaotic billiards. Notably, our results indicate that for monochromatic random waves, the number variance of the intersection points increases logarithmically with the length of the line - in contrast with the linear growth predicted by the percolation model, which has been used to accurately model other long-range nodal properties of this field."}
{"text":"\nThis paper presents a new notion in linear dynamics: the concept of a $J$-class operator, which can be viewed as a localized version of hypercyclicity. We focus on bounded linear operators $T$ on Banach spaces $X$ and non-zero vectors $x$ for which any open set $U\\subset X$ containing $x$ and non-empty open set $V\\subset X$ will satisfy $T^{n}U\\cap V\\neq\\emptyset$ for some integer $n$ greater than 0. Various examples of such operators are provided and it is shown how results from the theory of hypercyclic operators apply to this concept.

This paper presents an initial evaluation of the feasibility of this approach, with tests concluded on 10 healthy seated participants resulting in 92% success. Validation in the paraplegic population is required to fully confirm these findings, which could potentially offer a new health education approach to pressure ulcer prevention in this population."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate HST\/ACS photometry of the affluent star cluster NGC 1846 in the Large Magellanic Cloud and discover it has a double main sequence turn-off feature. Despite this, the main sequence, sub-giant branch, and red giant branch are of consistent size, and the red clump is dense. Through examining the turn-off star spatial distribution, all stars were found to be part of NGC 1846, not a field star population. Additionally, the distributions of the two turn-off groups present different central concentrations and asymmetry. By fitting isochrones, we explain the colour-magnitude diagram properties through two populations with the same metal abundance and a difference in age of roughly 300 Myr, having absolute ages of 1.9 to 2.2 Gyr. [M\/H] was computed to be -0.40 from the isochrone fitting, and is compatible with spectroscopic measurements of [Fe\/H]. We offer that the recorded attributes of NGC 1846 can be interpreted as a consequence of tidal abduction of two star clusters from a sole giant molecular cloud, thus accounting for the age gap, uniform metal abundance and the variations in the spatial distribution."}
{"text":"\nThis paper introduces a novel method for navigating the low-energy conformational space of proteins through the use of the Wang-Landau molecular dynamics (MD) technique. It is argued that the effectiveness of multicanonical MD can be improved by introducing a procedure to accurately calculate the density of states. Two original improvements, namely the use of a Gaussian distribution generated with a short canonical simulation and the application of an approximated derivative based on that same distribution and the multiple-weighted histogram, are proposed in order to make the estimation process more efficient and reliable. Two polypeptides, Met-enkephalin and Trp-cage, are chosen as models and tested for their response to the Wang-Landau MD. The results suggest that this method of searching for low-energy conformations is comparable to that of replica exchange MD but can explore a much wider range of conformational variation."}
{"text":"\nIn this article, we examine the prospect of detecting gravitational waves from binary systems merging in the third and fourth runs of LIGO science. We conducted an analysis which targets the inspiral phase of the binary. The classification of the binary systems was determined by their mass - primordial black hole binaries with 0.35 to 1.0 M(sun), binary neutron stars (1.0 to 3.0 M(sun)), and binary black holes (3.0 to 40.0 M(sun) for the third run, and 3.0 to 80.0 M(sun) for the fourth). After surveying 1364 hours of data, we found no gravitational waves signals. Through supposing a binary population with a Gaussian distribution around 0.75-0.75 M(sun), 1.4-1.4 M(sun) and 5.0-5.0 M(sun), we were able to place 90%-confidence upper limit rates of 4.9 per year per 10^(10) solar blue light luminosity for primordial black hole binaries, 1.2 per year per 10^(10) solar blue light luminosity for binary neutron stars and 0.5 per year per 10^(10) solar blue light luminosity for binary black holes."}
{"text":"\nThe geometry and topology of the relativistic universe can not be accurately determined without complicated mathematics and certain observational tests. We examine the mathematical properties of multiply connected spaces and discuss the different methods available to assess their characteristics. Friedmann-Lemaitre universe models can then be constructed, and expected global effects such as the Cosmic Microwave Background can be assessed to determine the topology of the universe. According to the 2003-2006 WMAP data, various discrepancies with theflat infinite universe model suggest that the shape of space is likely to be more complex than previously thought. In particular, the Poincar\u00e9 dodecahedral spherical space, which has a volume roughly 80% the size of the observable universe, is a promising explanation for both the local curvature of space and the large angle anomalies in the temperature power spectrum. This smaller universe has the potential to be observed through a unique topological lens effect, and raises questions about the physics of the early universe."}
{"text":"\nIn this work, we analyze the small-scale clustering of a photometric-redshift catalog of Luminous Red Galaxies known as \"MegaZ-LRG\", which spans redshifts from 0.4 to 0.7 and covers a cosmic volume of 2.5 h^-3 Gpc^3. By examining 380,000 photometric redshifts, we detect significant deviations from the canonical power-law fit to the angular correlation function within a series of narrow redshift slices. These deviations are attributed to the manner in which these galaxies inhabit dark matter haloes, leading to distinct \"1-halo\" and \"2-halo\" clustering terms. Our results are modeled by the halo occupation distribution and show that the majority of galaxies are primary citizens of their host dark matter haloes rather than satellites in more massive systems. The effective halo masses of MegaZ-LRG galaxies range from log_10 (M_eff \/ h^-1 M_sol) = 13.61 - 13.8 with corresponding number densities in the range of n_g = 5.03 - 0.56 x 10^-4 h^3 Mpc^-3. This analysis confirms the applicability of the halo model in deciphering physical information from the observed galaxy clustering."}
{"text":"\nIn this study, temperature and frequency dependent impedance of an electroceramic functional oxide thermistor was investigated in order to gain a greater understanding of the charge transport and dielectric properties of polycrystalline device materials. Using alternating current impedance spectroscopy, three distinct relaxation phenomena were identified, all exhibiting a temperature-dependent resistivity. Both grain boundary and interface contributions had different capacitance values, highlighting the composite nature of the dielectric properties in polycrystalline ceramics. The findings illustrate that impedance spectroscopy is a useful method for modelling this behavior."}
{"text":"\nAn extensive analysis of N-body simulations in the context of cosmological models is presented in this article to further explore the claim that there is a lack of a connection between the distribution of galaxies and their peculiar velocities within the Local Volume (LV). The simulations revealed that there is no correlation between the exact and the local gravitational field obtained by pairwise newtonian forces between halos. Additionally, the local gravitational field and peculiar velocity for each halo were found to be uncorrelated with each other. The basis for this conclusion is that even when all matter within the LV is accounted for, there is a noticeable amount of scatter when examining the correlation between exact gravitation acceleration and peculiar velocity. This research has reached the conclusion that no correlation between the local gravitation and peculiar velocity fields with LG-like objects is expected in the CDM cosmologies."}
{"text":"The current study examines how Collaborative Beamforming (CB) and Cooperative Transmission (CT) can be used to improve the longevity of networks composed of battery-driven nodes. This paper looks at the positive influence that allowing nearby nodes to employ CB\/CT to decrease the burden or avoid transmitting requests to nodes with scarce battery life can have. Initially, the authors analyze the effect of CB\/CT on the signal strength at a far off destination using energy from local nodes. Subsequently, the improvements gained when applying this technique to a 2D disk case are measured. Additionally, formulating a new routing issue as a linear programming problem is considered for networks in which data generating rates remain constant. Lastly, for more general networks, the cost for routing is adaptively adjusted dependent on the remaining energy, along with the capacity of CB\/CT. Outcomes of the research, together with simulation results, demonstrate that the proposed technique can lessen the energy demands of close to depleted nodes by approximately 90% in the specialized case network, while also improving the lifetimes of general networks by approximately 10% compared to other existing techniques."}

{"text":"\nWe explore the energy dependence of the quasi periodic oscillations (QPO) seen in X-ray binaries in two distinct geometries - standard cold disc models with active X-ray production or a hot flow without a cold disc at the QPO radius. Our modelling find that the QPO spectrum is generally related to the radiation emitted at the QPO radius, with relativistic effects creating broadening. We note the presence of a disc component in the first model, which is absent in the second. We review available evidence of this spectral difference and suggest that the absence of a disc component in the energy spectra of high frequency QPO indicates that a hot flow geometry is often present in states where these QPO appear."}
{"text":"\nThe objective of this paper is to extend the lifetime of wireless sensor networks through the usage of Collaborative Beamforming (CB) and Cooperative Transmission (CT), which allow nodes to share resources. To maximize the network lifetime, we propose a new approach of reducing or avoiding the forwarding of packets to nodes with a low battery level. The effectiveness of CB\/CT in raising signal strength of a distant node is analysed and a two-dimensional disk case is used to observe how it improves the performance. For general networks, the task of routing is handled according to the remaining energy and effectiveness of CB\/CT. Through both analysis and simulation, it is observed that the proposed scheme has the ability to increase the network lifetime to about 90% for the 2D disk network, and about 10% in general networks, in comparison to conventional strategies."}
{"text":"This paper examines the almost product evaluation of Hankel determinants in order to find a product form evaluation for the intermediate case of ${3k+1 \\choose k}$. This Hankel determinant has not yet been evaluated due to its lack of product form evaluations. The method used in this paper offers a sum of a small number of products, referred to as an almost product, and thus provides an evaluation. Furthermore, the method demonstrates the salient points for the evaluation of other Hankel determinants with polynomial entries, as well as product and almost product form evaluations at special points."}
{"text":"\nThe use of cooperative transmission in future wireless networks is hindered by its low spectral efficiency and need for orthogonal channels. This article proposes protocols using multiuser detection (MUD) and network coding that attain high spectral efficiency, coding gain, and diversity order. Differently from standard cooperative transmission protocols utilizing single-user detection, this improved method benefits all source users present. Via simulation, it is seen that the proposed protocols yield an increased diversity gain, better asymptotic efficiency, and a reduced bit error rate in comparison to conventional MUD and existing cooperative transmission methods."}
{"text":"\nWe explore the superparticle spectra and LHC signature outputs for large-scale string models in moduli-fixed string compactifications with branes and fluxes, with a cutting-edge laboratory energy level of 10^{11} GeV. Magnetic fluxes on the brane plane perturb the soft terms away from what was previously computed in the dilute-flux limit. Through an analysis of high-scale gauge couplings, we gauge the active impact of the magnetic fluxes and generate an abundance of random spectra with the soft terms adjusted around the dilute-flux limit. Despite the presence of a 40% variation in the high-scale soft terms, the low-energy spectra exhibit a clear and uniform pattern. The minimal models predict ratios of gaugino masses to be M_1 : M_2 : M_3=(1.5 - 2) : 2 : 6, differing from both mSUGRA and mirage mediation. Squark scalars are lighter and the sleptons heavier than comparable mSUGRA models. We create 10 fb^{-1} of simulated data from the random spectra with which to study the scope of the collider phenomenology, with the example large-volume string model spectrum subjected to a detailed mass reconstruction. With a mere 100 fb^{-1} of integrated luminosity, the model is distinguishable from mSUGRA, and certain aspects of the sparticle spectrum can be accurately reconstructed."}
{"text":"\nThis paper examines the use of distributed sensing in which multiple wireless sensors measure and transmit the same quantity to a fusion center via amplify-and-forward (analog) transmissions over non-ideal fading communications channels. Using the Best Linear Unbiased Estimator (BLUE), the study discusses an equal-power transmission strategy which introduces the concept of estimation outage and estimation diversity, and reveals an achievable diversity gain equivalent to the number of sensors. Power allocation strategies for two cases are then considered: minimizing distortion under power constraints and minimising power under distortion constraints. It is demonstrated that adaptive power gain can be achieved by turning off bad sensors with poor channel conditions or observation quality, similar to array gain in MISO multi-antenna systems. Finally, the paper considers energy efficiency issues in sensor networks when the sum power is minimized under a zero-outage estimation distortion constraint."}
{"text":"\nThis paper investigates the process of external information propagation in a Random Boolean Network through analytical and numerical estimations. By simulating the external regulation (PER) dynamics, the research identifies variables that are entirely determined by this external regulation. Correspondingly, all variables that are not related to external information form a core of networks containing notable non-trivial feedback loops. In addition, a message-passing method is utilized to study the statistical properties of these cores, depending on the external conditions and the Boolean network. Finally, the analysis outlines a relationship between PER dynamics and the full Random Asynchronous Dynamics (RAD) of a Boolean network."}
{"text":"\nThis paper explores the construction and effects of consistent interactions added to a free, Abelian gauge theory including a finite number of BF models and two-form gauge fields. Using specific cohomological tools such as the master equation and its solution, the hypothesis of smooth coupling constants, locality, Lorentz covariance, Poincare invariance, and the maintenance of the same amount of derivatives with respect to the free theory allows us to create the resulting generalized non-Abelian Freedman-Townsend model, and thereby generate expressions of the corresponding deformed Lagrangian action, gauge transformations, and related algebra. Additionally, consistency conditions of the interactions in each successive power of the coupling constant are achieved by obtaining solutions to a set of equations."}
{"text":"In this paper, we explore the give-and-take between the two benefits of time hopping impulse radio, pulse combining gain and pulse spreading gain, in presence of timing jitter. We analyze the impact of Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel on bit error probability for systems with and without pulse-based randomization, using both symbol- synchronous and chip-synchronous scenarios. In addition, the effects of multiple access interference and timing jitter on the selection of optimal system parameters are researched and clarified through theoretical observations. Finally, a multipath scenario is investigated, to assess the trade-off between processing gains of a synchronous impulse radio system with pulse-based polarity randomization. The effects of timing jitter, multiple-access interference and inter-frame interference are also consider and proved by simulation studies."}
{"text":"\nWe assess the complexity of Villamayor's algorithm in the context of non-exceptional monomial ideals, which are locally determined by a single monomial. This resolution of a monomial ideal, $<X_1^{a_1}\\cdot ... \\cdot X_n^{a_n}>$, can be equated to a special toric issue, $<Z^c-X_1^{a_1}\\cdot ... \\cdot X_n^{a_n}>$. When the exponents $a_i$ are all equal to or greater than the critical value $c$, we develop the biggest part of the resolution tree to infer an upper cap made up of partial sums of Catalan numbers. This situation is termed the minimal codimensional case. Catalan numbers have various applications in Combinatorics, for instance, calculating the amount of possible spousal couples when inserting $n$ brackets into a word $n+1$ words long, or plane trees with $n+1$ vertices. \nIn instances where an exponent $a_{i_0}$ is less than the critical value $c$, we refer to this as the ``case of higher codimension''. Here, we highlight an example that still needs to be resolved.\nTo better understand the performance of the resolution invariant, computations were done in Singular (\\cite{sing}) with the \\emph{desing} package via G. Bodn\u00e1r and J. Schicho, (see \\cite{lib})."}
{"text":"\nThrough a Zakharov simulation study, we have investigated the spectral properties of on-demand Langmuir turbulence that is formed in an inhomogeneous plasma of the Earth's ionosphere. The model includes dissipative maneuvers to model collisions, Landau damping of electrons and ions, and a density profile, with a length scale of approximately 10-100km, that represents the inhomogeneity of the ionospheric plasma. In order to generate turbulence, energy is included by a continuing source term in the Zakharov equation, inputted by an HF radio beam that is injected into the ionospheric plasma. Langmuir turbulence can then be studied using radars and receivers based on the ground that record secondary radiation. Various parameter sets, as well as different altitudes in relation to the turning point of the Langmuir mode, were implemented and analyzed. Our findings have secured a scaling law that links the spectral width of the turbulent frequency spectrum to the physical parameters present in the ionosphere, providing a quantitative relationship between the physical parameters (such as temperatures, electron number density and ionospheric length) and the observed frequency spectrum for potential use in interpreting experiments."}
{"text":"\nBy projecting Ringel's non-Pappus pseudoline arrangement into the Euclidean plane, one can observe that a particular arrangement of nine triangles is implicitly embedded. This arrangement is subject to a complex constraint involving the sines of its angles, which is impossible to be satisfied by any projection of the initial arrangement. These observations, along with the use of systems of inequalities arising from the polar coordinates of the lines and normal forms for sums of products of sines, provide sufficient evidence to prove Pappus's theorem. Furthermore, this result can be generalized to arrangements derived from edge-connected, totally cyclic directed graphs, potentially leading to a full solution to the sliding problem for rank 3 oriented matroids."}
{"text":"\nThe possibility of employing phase-stabilized femtosecond frequency combs to make precise measurements of atomic helium transitions is examined. The comb's self-calibrating nature, as well as its capability to be shifted into the ultraviolet spectral range, can provide improved accuracy for such measurements. Atoms must first be cooled and trapped in a specific state of metastability; this can be done in part by using a magneto-optical trap. We consider scenarios by which two-photon excitation could be used to measure the two-photon $2^3S \\to 4^3S$ interval, and for resonant two-photon excitation to high Rydberg states, $2^3S \\to 3^3P \\to n^3S,D$, as well as single-state spectrum measures. A particularly significant case we foresee is measuring the $1^1S \\to 2^1S$ transition with great accuracy through two-photon excitation in a \u2018magic wavelength trap\u2019 wherein both states are treated identically. A \u2018triple magic wavelength\u2019 of 412 nm, where the polarizabilities of 1^1S, 2^1S and 2^3S states prove to be small and positive, could pave the way for many experiments using trapped helium atoms."}
{"text":"\nIn this article, we investigate the radio continuum emission of galaxies in a 600 sq. deg. region of the local universe, which is known as the Shapley Supercluster (SSC). We use data from the FLASH and 6dFGS redshift surveys and NVSS radio sources in order to determine the environmental effects that are present. We measure the fraction of high radio loudness galaxies found in the 10 Mpc Abell 3558 cluster complex located at the SSC's core (SSC-CR). This fraction is roughly half that of galaxies found elsewhere in the SSC. We determine that the suppression of radio loudness in the SSC-CR is associated with the density of the large-scale environment, as well as the proximity to the cluster (R\/r200). Additionally, we identify that the radio loudness of non-brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) within SSC-CR clusters cannot be explained by direct major galaxy mergers or rapid flyby collisions, but rather by the loss of gas supply due to the powerful ram pressure resulting from the two merging clusters and the shockfront between them."}
{"text":"This article explores the extent of sensing capacity achieved in sensor networks in a framework where observations are linear and SNR values remain fixed. We show that sparsity of phenomenon is a significant factor which influences sensing capacity. Bearing this in mind, we formulate generalizations of Fano\u2019s Inequality, from which we derive upper bounds of sensing capacity. Our results demonstrate that when SNR is fixed, for sparse occurrence, sensing capacity diminishes to zero, which means that more sensors are required to detect it. Furthermore, we explore how sensing diversity impacts sensing capacity, by suggesting that random sampling leads to better results than contiguous sampling."}
{"text":"\nThe present research investigates the mesoscopic fluctuations and weak localization corrections on the supercurrent in Josephson junctions involving diffusive electron motion in their normal parts. Two distinct types of junction - a chaotic dot with tunnel barriers between it and the superconductors, and a diffusive junction with transparent interfaces - are studied. The current fluctuations, along with the weak localization corrections in relation to the average current, are established as a function of certain parameters including the ratio between the superconducting gap and the electron dwell energy, the temperature and the phase difference across the junction. To consider the inhomogeneous proximity effect of the normal region, the replicated version of the \\sigma-model is applied. In the case of a diffusive junction with transparent interfaces, the mesoscopic fluctuations of the critical current appear to be is nearly 3 times higher than the previous estimates when taking the proximity effect into account."}
{"text":"\nWe examine the kinematics of the far off (233 kpc distant) Leo II dwarf spheroidal galaxy, making use of 171 stellar radial velocities gleaned from medium-resolution spectroscopy. Our data covers the full radial extent of the galaxy, leaving no possibility of substantial levels of rotation or velocity inconsistency that could arise from tidal effects. Through the use of Jeans' equation, we template a range of dark matter halo models and compute the global mass-to-light ratio to fall in the range 27-45 solar units. Our results imply the presence of a central core to the halo with slightly positive velocity anisotropy. All in all Leo II affirms the conclusion that dwarf galaxies, such as those satellites of the Milky Way, contain a unified population of dark matter halos with measurements consistent with a central core and a total mass to scale similarly with other dwarf spheroidals."}
{"text":"This paper investigates the presence of black-body components in Gamma Ray Burst spectra. We analyse seven GRBs with measured spectroscopic redshifts and compare them to the empirical correlation between peak energy and the total prompt isotropic energy. Results from time-resolved spectral analysis suggest that although a power-law and black-body combination yields acceptable fits to BATSE energy range, the black-body contributes a relatively small fraction of total flux in the WFC X-ray range. The evidence from fitting the spectra with Band model and cutoff power-law model indicate that the X-ray flux and spectral slope of GRBs can be explained without a black-body component."}
{"text":"The symmetric heavy-light ansatz provides a method for finding the ground state of a diluted, unpolarized system of two-component fermions. Based on the Kohn-Sham equations in density functional theory, the approach skews the mass ratio between the different components, resulting in an effective single-particle solution. In order to retain the original Z_2 symmetry, a constraint is imposed onto the N-body density correlations of the two components. This method has been applied to the 1D, 2D and 3D attractive Hubbard models, and its results were found to agree well with exact Lanczos calculations for few-body systems and Monte Carlo simulations for many-body systems."}
{"text":"\nThis article explores the process of domain formation at finite temperature and magnetic field in two-dimensional optical traps of $s=1$ spinor Bose condensates. Through researching the fundamental ground state phase diagrams and modeling through three different approaches, we investigate the role of different conserved quantities. We find that the dynamic critical exponent for model A and F is equal to $z=2$, but differs for GP with $z \\approx 3$. An inclusion of externally imposed magnetization conservation for models A and F yields the same value of $z \\approx 3$, suggesting that magnetization density is the only conserved quantity relevant to domain formation."}
{"text":"\nIn this article, we explore the positioning of isolated satellites of host galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the Millennium Run simulation in comparison. We discover a good correspondence between the observations and the theory when two distinct prescriptions to embed luminous galaxies within the simulated dark matter halos are applied. Looking at scales of up to 500 kpc, it is evident that the satellites of red hosts with low star formation rates are generally situated near the host's major axes, whereas the satellites orbiting blue, low-mass hosts with similar star formation rates show very little anisotropy. The difference in the positioning of the blue and red satellites likely stems from the varying dependence of their mean location in relation to the projected distance between them and the interloper contamination in the latter sample. Furthermore, the red satellites exhibit much greater anisotropy than the blue due to their ancient arrival date in their hosts' halos as well as the lower anisotropy rate because of the interloper pollution."}
{"text":"\nWe explore the implications of supersymmetry-breaking in models where it is present at a lower intermediate scale compared to the Grand Unified Theory (GUT) level. We assume that the parameters of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model are unified at the M_{in} scale and look at the effects of this on the (m_{1\/2},m_0) plane for two different values of tan(beta)=10 and tan(beta)=50. We also identify cases where the gaugino and scalar masses are uniform under the GUT scale, which are situations in mirage-mediation models. We demand that the Lightest Neutralino (LSP) be the relic neutralino density and ensure that the measurements from WMAP and other instruments do not conflict with this. For reasonable values of M_{in}, we find that the constraints on the (m_{1\/2},m_0) plane are tight, but that the relic density is not terribly restrictive. At very low M_{in}, the electroweak vacuum conditions are the main limitation, and a secondary source of cosmological cold dark matter would be required for a large range of soft SUSY-breaking parameters and tan(beta) to explain the observed relic density. We compute the neutralinos-nucleon cross sections for feasible models and compare them with current and projected limits from dark matter searches."}
{"text":"This paper discusses the development of a real-time algorithm for correcting videos that have reduced quality due to turbulence. By stabilizing the same, and by utilizing the turbulence in the motion, the video's resolution can be boosted. The core mechanism revolves around generation of a reference frame, along with estimation of the local image displacement map for upcoming frames. Following that, the map is segmented into stationary and moving objects, and resolution enhancement is applied to stationary objects, while preserving their authentic motion. Tests conducted on both artificial and normal sequence have abundantly shown that videos resulting from this procedure display better resolution, along with the stabilization of stationary objects in real-time."}
{"text":"\nIn this article, we provide evidence that the Riemann Hypothesis (RH) is closely related to a finite Euler product and approximations of the Riemann zeta-function in a region containing a majority of the critical strip on the right half. Conversely, a good approximation by products will result in a finite number of zeros on the same strip. To further explore this relationship, we establish a parameterized family of non-analytic functions sharing the same property which satisfy the RH with a finite number of zeros off the critical line. By analyzing the structure of these functions, we identify the source of their simple zeros and their repulsion from one another which can inform the understanding of the zeta-function's zeros. Results from computation prove the closeness of the zeros of these functions and the zeta-function under RH and demonstrate the convergence of their moduli twice the modulus of the zeta-function between its own zeros. We conclude by discussing possible analogues for different L-functions and the study of the distribution of zeros."}
{"text":"\nThis paper proposes an adaptive strategy to tackle the challenge of updating classification models with new information. Instead of using traditional machine learning tools such as neural networks and support vector machines, we propose the use of the incremental learning capability of fuzzy ARTMAP as an alternative. This algorithm is then combined with an evolutionary strategy of selection and combination of individual classifiers into a unified ensemble system. The proposed system has been tested using data from the G-Protein Coupled Receptor Database and demonstrated a high accuracy of 83%. Additionally, it is generally applicable and can be used in various problems related to genomics and proteomics."}
{"text":"\nThis study looks at the distribution of active galactic nuclei (AGN) in clusters of galaxies across a uniformly selected, spectroscopically complete sample of 35 AGN from eight clusters at redshifts from 0.06 to 0.31. Results indicate that AGN with X-ray luminosities higher than 10^42 erg\/s that are in galaxies whose luminosities have a rest-frame M_R less than -20 mag, appear to be more centrally concentrated than normal cluster galaxies of similar luminosity. However, a larger sample of 30 cluster AGN with luminosities of 10^41 erg\/s showed no evidence for higher centralisation, nor for differing kinematic or substructure distributions. Comparing the AGN fraction that was X-ray selected in this study to those selected in the field suggested that the AGN fraction was not substantially lower in clusters, compared to the approximately constant radio-selected AGN fraction in both clusters and the field. Additionally, evidence was provided of variability between clusters, exploring the relation of the AGN fraction with redshift, velocity dispersion, cluster substructure, and Butcher-Oemler fraction. Although hints of a connection between these four parameters was found, further study is required in order to ascertain which one(s) most significantly affect the cluster AGN fraction."}
{"text":"This article explores the application of spectral methods to orthogonal rational functions with their poles located outside of the unit circle. Through an identification of a suitable matrix representation of the multiplication operator associated with the given orthogonality measure, two separate solutions are discussed, each involving linear fractional transformations. These solutions are applied to Hessenberg and five-diagonal unitary matrices and the orthogonality measure is recovered from the spectral measure of the corresponding infinite unitary matrix. Additionally, simpler relations between the support of the orthogonality measure, the pole's location, and the parameters of the recurrence relation are developed and these results are extended to orthogonal polynomials on the real line with poles in the lower half plane."}
{"text":"\nIn this article, the author presents research on a revolutionary new concept - an inflatable electrostatic 'AB' space tower (or mast, more commonly known as a space elevator). This tower can potentially reach heights of up to one hundred and twenty thousand kilometers, or even more, and may be self-assembled, starting from the surface of the Earth without the use of rockets - greatly reducing the cost to deploy. Due to the use of electron gas to fill the tower, the pressure of up to one atmosphere is achievable with negligible small weight and surprising properties. The AB tower boasts several advantages over conventional space elevators, such as not needing a top cable for geosynchronous orbits (36,000 km), greater load capacities and being significantly lighter than the space elevator. Additionally, the tower is capable of bending in any needed direction when given the appropriate electric voltage, and maintains stability even at great heights. Three projects at heights of 100 km, 36,000 km, and 120,000 km are described and explored."}
{"text":"\nIn this study, we utilized helioseismic holography to study a powerful sunquake generated by an X1.2-class solar flare of active region 10720 on 2005 January 15. A compact acoustic source aligned with the impulsive hard X-ray and visible-continuum emission along the penumbral neutral line separating the two major opposing umbrae of the $\\delta$-configuration sunspot was detected. The visbile continuum emission was estimated to be roughly 500 times greater than the seismic emission. This flare had no evidence for protons in the particle beams thought to supply the energy of the flare. This finding is consistent with the \"back-warming\" hypothesis, which states that the low photosphere is heated by intense Balmer and Paschen continuum-edge radiation from the overlying chromosphere in white-light flares."}
{"text":"\nThe author studied a Mathieu-like equation with multiplicative white noise to examine its impact on the amplifier of a parametric resonant system. Using a symplectic numerical method for solving the stochastic differential equations, the approximate value of the parameter exponent at the extremum of the parametric resonance regions was calculated theoretically by factoring in the width of interval time. Results show that the exponent decreases with increase of the parameter $\\alpha$, reaching a minimum before increasing after. It was determined that the exponent has only one minimum at $\\alpha \\neq 0$, demonstrating the suppressive effect of multiplicative white noise in the parametric resonant system by dampening its growth."}
{"text":"We investigate the metallicity distributions in high-latitudes with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Data covers Galactic longitudes 0<l<360. We observe significant fluctuations in metallicity at z<2.5 kpc, similar to those in the thick-disc scaleheight, as a result of the Galactic flare effect. Additionally, our results suggest three different vertical metallicity gradients of d[M\/H]\/dz=-0.22(+\/-0.03), d[M\/H]\/dz=-0.38 (+\/-0.06), and d[M\/H]\/dz=-0.08 (+\/-0.07) dex\/kpc for z<3, 3<z<5, and 5<z<10 kpc, respectively. Our data indicates the dissipational formation of the disc at short distances, a transition between different population components of the Galaxy, and a low value to describe the inner-halo metallicity gradient."}
{"text":"Recently identified X-ray transients associated with optically non-active galactic nuclei have been studied in relation to the conventional tidal disruption model. This suggests the X-ray emission is generated by accretion disk radiation, yet the model does not fully explain the observed light curves and late-time spectra. Therefore, we consider the hypothesis that the X-ray emission from these transient active galactic nuclei is also related to a shock-produced jet. After comparing the model light curves and synchrotron radiation spectra with the observed data, we have found evidence to support our hypothesis. Our model predicts that these transient galactic nuclei may soon be detectable by gamma-ray satellites such as GLAST and that the emission region will, over time, expand."}
{"text":"We present an iterative approach to compute the sign function of a non-Hermitian matrix that is applicable to the overlap Dirac operator at a nonzero chemical potential. Our approach is based on the Arnoldi algorithm and its Krylov subspace approximation, with added critical eigenvectors to accommodate discontinuities. We demonstrate its improved efficiency numerically and discuss its relevance when the same matrix has to be operated on many times."}
{"text":"\nThis paper focuses on an optimized design of an occulter that would enable a 4m telescope to search the habitable zones of numerous stars for Earth-like exoplanets. A key factor in the cost and success of this kind of mission will be the separation between the telescope and the occulter, meaning it is essential to devise an occulter that is small enough to be positioned close to the telescope yet deep and broad enough to effectively block starlight. We show that in order to detect a planet 0.06 arcseconds away from a star of 10 billion times brighter, the occulter requires a shape tailored for this size, 50 meters in diameter, and would have to fly around 72,000 km from the telescope."}
{"text":"\nIn this article, we investigate scaling relations between radio power (P_R), size of the radio emitting region (R_H), total cluster mass (M_H) and cluster velocity dispersion (sigma_H) of giant radio halos in clusters based on the re-acceleration model. For this purpose, we extract data from recent radio and X-ray for a referred selection of clusters with giant radio halos. Our analysis finds a significant correlation between P_R and R_H and a tight scaling between M_H and R_H. In addition, P_R is seen to be linked to M_H and sigma_H and R_H is dependent on sigma_H. These trends are observed to be in agreement with a mild variation of the average magnetic field strength inside the radio halo volume with cluster mass. Moreover, we discover that R_H increases non-linearly compared to the virial radius. This implies a greater proportion of the cluster area filled by the radio-emitting component in higher mass clusters and consequently indicates that the non-thermal component in such clusters is not self-similar."}
{"text":"\nUsing Subaru SuprimeCam imaging, we have captured a total of 13 faint meteors and 44 artificial objects while observing during the Perseids 2004. CCD photometry on the detected meteors including 1 Perseid, 1 Aquarid, and 11 sporadic meteors was analyzed, revealing a peak video-rate magnitude in the range of 4.0< V_{vr} <6.4 and 4.1< I_{vr}<5.9. We also constructed a model to estimate the collisionally excited column diameter of the meteors, determining it to be as small as a few mm. Out of the 44 artificial objects, 17 were confirmed to be cataloged satellites\/space debris. The findings from these observations further support prior knowledge on our understanding of celestial phenomena."}
{"text":"\nThis article addresses the question of which is the egg or the chicken in the hole-formation story of galaxies by studying the collapse of local density maxima and their surrounding envelopes. When starting to evolve, these local density maxima are theorized as homogeneous peaks while living within power-law density profile envelopes. Analyzing the influence of a second parameter, the ratio between peak and total mass, on this relationship, the article explores a special case that describes the central collapse in the context of quintessence cosmological models. Constraints are put on the fractional hole mass with respect to the overdensity mass, and the changes in evolution dependent on different mean peak heights related to equal masses are studied. The conclusion is that the gravitational collapse of homogeneous peaks within overdensities may be a mechanism for hole formation that is completed in early times- before halo, bulge and disk formations take place."}
{"text":"\nIn this paper, we simulate the charging of the ASTROD I test mass in the presence of solar energetic particles using the GEANT4 toolkit. Results show that the rate of charge accumulations due to cosmic-ray protons ranges from 9.0 to 26.5 +e\/s at solar maximum and minimum, respectively. Moreover, the acceleration noise due to charging is considerably larger during the four most intense solar energetic particle events between September and October 1989, with values up to 64300 +e\/s at peak intensity. As a way to reduce such disturbances, our work suggests the implementation of continuous discharge to suppress this charging noise. Nevertheless, the acceleration noise generated by the small events would be well below the required noise budget specifications."}
{"text":"\nThis article examines the characteristics of thermally stimulated luminescence (TSL) and conductivity (TSC) through the classical insulator model. It assumes the presence of one type of active trap, one kind of inactive deep trap, and one kind of recombination center. Equations for the model are solved both with and without the use of quasiequilibrium (QE) approximation. Three parameters, qI, g, and q*=qIg, are used to analyze TSL and TSC. Results offer insight into the upper temperature limit for the QS state for different heating rates and the properties of TSL and TSC curves in the QS state comparable to those of the QE state. Analytical formulas for calculation of qI and q* at the beginning of the TSL and TSC curves are provided and used by the heating-rate methods proposed in this study."}
{"text":"This article introduces a novel framework, Designated Object Evaluation Framework (DOEF), for the testing and evaluation of database performance for object-oriented and object-relational models. The DOEF is capable of simulating various kinds of access pattern change through configurable models, making it both open and extensible. To demonstrate its capabilities, experiments were conducted to compare the performance of four state-of-the-art dynamic clustering algorithms and two different object stores. Results from the experiments showed that DOEF is effective in detecting the variations in performance of the different algorithms. It was also revealed that dynamic clustering algorithms can manage moderate levels of pattern change, but perform poorly with more vigorous change. The DOEF experiments also exposed the poor swapping performance of the Platypus object store."}
{"text":"\nThis article explores two separate constructions of type ${\\rm II_1}$ factors having a prescribed countable fundamental group. The first involves group actions on almost periodic free Araki-Woods factors that meet two conditions: mixing and free malleability, as defined by Popa. When the group $G$ chosen is an ICC $w$-rigid group with trivial centralizer (e.g. $G = \\Z^2 \\rtimes \\SL(2,\\Z)$), there will be an action on $L(\\F_\\infty)$ that forms a type ${\\rm II_1}$ factor with fundamental group $S$, where $S$ is an arbitrary countable subgroup of $\\R^*_+$. The other construction involves a free product of factors, such that for a factor $B(H)$ of type ${\\rm I}$ with a normal faithful state $\\psi$, the centralizer of the free product $(L(G) \\ast B(H))^{\\tau \\ast \\psi}$ turns out to be a type ${\\rm II_1}$ factor with fundamental group $\\Gamma$, which is the subgroup of $\\R^*_+$ generated by the point spectrum of $\\psi$.

{"text":"\nIn this study, photometric and spectroscopic observations were conducted on V209 omega Cen, an eclipsing binary system in the globular cluster omega Cen. By analyzing the results, it was determined that both component stars possess masses of 0.945 +\/- 0.043 Msun and 0.144 +\/- 0.008 Msun, radii of 0.983 +\/- 0.015 Rsun and 0.425 +\/- 0.008 Rsun, and luminosities of 6.68 +\/- 0.88 Lsun and 2.26 +\/- 0.28 Lsun, respectively. Additionally, the cooler primary component has an effective temperature measurement of 9370 K, and the hotter secondary component has 10866 K. The positions of both stars within the cluster's colour-magnitude diagram are discussed. We then propose an alternative explanation for the unusual properties of the binary system, postulating that the primary star was previously a white dwarf that gained an additional envelope from the secondary star and then ``re-birthed'' with the secondary star losing majority of its own envelope while it started its climb up the subgiant branch."}
{"text":"This study examines the production of gamma-rays in three young open clusters: Berk 87, Cyg OB2 and Westerlund 2. It is hypothesized that recent detections of TeV gamma-ray sources near these clusters are the result of cosmic ray acceleration, a process which could be the result of shocks in massive stellar winds, pulsars and their nebulae, and\/or supernova shocks. We have analyzed the radiation processes from both electrons and hadrons and have applied a scenario involving acceleration of particles due to shocks arising from WR type stars. Our goal is to determine the broad band spectrum of each cluster using existing observational constraints, and to ascertain whether or not the high energy phenomena, ranging from X-rays up to GeV-TeV gamma-rays, are related to each other. Our conclusion is that the most likely explanation is a hybrid (leptonic-hadronic) model in which leptons are responsible for the X-ray and GeV gamma-ray emission and hadrons are responsible for the TeV gamma-ray emission, which is produced inside the open cluster and in its surrounding clouds."}
{"text":"\nTo examine the possibility of Neutralino Dark Matter, we will study the SUSY-SU(5) model with one right-handed neutrino which features a large top-like Yukawa coupling. We assume the existence of universal soft masses at high scale and look into the low-energy system and its LSP relic density. In this analysis it was revealed that for $\\tan\\beta \\leq 35$, there is no feasible region in parameter space whereas for higher values of $\\tan\\beta$, the $\\tilde{\\tau}$ coannihilation process can become effective. Although, this arrives with the limitation stau being lighter than the LSP. For greater $\\tan\\beta \\simeq 45-50$, an A-pole funnel region could appear though the focus-point region is still difficult to be achieved till very large $m_0,M_{1\/2}$ values (a few TeV). In addition, it was shown with the employment of large $A_0$ terms at the high scale, it is possible to obtain regions that respect WMAP conditions and lifts the upper boundary in the stau coannihilation area."}
{"text":"\nThis research examines the changes in the superconducting characteristics, as well as the crystal structure, of MgB2 single crystals which have been substituted with Li, and co-substituted with Li-C. It has been determined that the introduction of holes into the lattice through Li substitution decreases the critical transition temperature Tc of the crystal, albeit at a slower rate than in the case of electron doping with elements such as Al or C. Additionally, when both Li and C are involved together, the Tc of the MgB2 crystal decreases even more severely. Examination of the temperature dependences of the upper critical field Hc2 for crystals of equivalent Tc with differing substitution levels has revealed that the Hc2 behaviour is similar in both hole and electron doped crystals. It is thought that this may be due to holes from Li occupying the pi band, while electrons from C filling the sigma band. Transport measurements have demonstrated a subsequent increase in resistivity in both Li-substituted and Li-C co-substituted crystals, which could be attributed to the formation of defects arising from the lattice distortions caused by substitution. It appears that both the introduction of carriers and newly created scattering mechanisms play a role in seeing changes in both Tc and Hc2."}
{"text":"\nWe have examined 1ES2344+514 (z = 0.044) in VHE gamma-rays and the near-infrared wavelength bands via TACTIC and MIRO telescopes. Our analysis from 18th October to 9th December 2004 and 27th October 2005-1st January 2006 provided no statistically significant $\\gamma$-ray signals. We estimated an upper limit of I($\\geq$1.5 TeV)$\\leq 3.84 \\times 10^{-12}$photons cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. Comparisons between TACTIC TeV light curves and RXTE ASM (2-12 keV) data found no remarkable increases. In 2004, there was minimal (~0.06 magnitude) day-to-day variation in both, J & H bands. Conversely, 1ES2344+514 grew brighter (J= 12.23 from October 2005 J magnitude = 12.64) from 27th October to 6th December 2005, then faded in the next few days. These variations were seen in both the J & H bands. The estimated emission region size is ~$10^{17}$ cms."}
{"text":"\nThe development of analytical models for understanding the formation and reionization of galaxies utilizes a type of probabilistic mathematics called random walks. Depending on the variables of a single random walk, outcomes may vary from the mass of star-forming halos to various sizes of ionized bubbles during reionization. To predict vary correlation functions or influence of spatial feedback processes, statistics of random walks at two distinct points must be understood. In the past, a joint statistic of related random walks with a constant barrier height has been derived. This research extends this knowledge to random walks with linear barriers, as demonstrated through a cosmological application determining the correlation of 21-cm fluctuations during reionization."}
{"text":"This study analyzes dijet correlations in proton-proton collisions at RHIC energies. We investigate both the correlations in azimuthal angle distributions and two-dimensional correlations in the transverse momenta of the jets. The analysis takes into consideration the $k_t$-factorization approach, which includes $2 \\to 2$ processes with soft radiations, and the next-to-leading order collinear factorization. The results of the investigation vary depending on the type of unintegrated gluon\/parton distributions used. Furthermore, we observed differences in the correlation measurements when considering any two jets and leading jets only. The $2 \\to 3$ contributions of the collinear NLO model stand out in small relative azimuthal angles and unequal transverse-momentum configurations. On the other hand, the $k_t$-factorization demonstrates no such limitations. We also investigated the effect of various cuts and quantified their influence."}
{"text":"\nThis article provides an educational overview of the cosmological inflationary perturbations that arise from quantum-mechanical principles. In particular, the focus of the paper is to draw a comparison between the well-known Schwinger effect and these inflationary perturbations. It is demonstrated that the two theories are only different by a canonical transformation. This means that the physical origins of both phenomena can be directly linked to quantization of a parametric oscillator that creates particles via the interaction with a classical external source - electric field in the Schwinger effect and gravitational field in the case of inflationary perturbations. As difficult as it is to practically create an electric field that produces particles that can be detected, the gravitational field in the early universe can prove to be powerful enough to give rise to effects that can be observed in the Cosmic Microwave Background temperature fluctuations. Lastly, the article also looks at how these quantum cosmological perturbations can be classified as classical."}
{"text":"\nWe explore the metal enrichment of the gas in minihalos which have become virialized at high redshift, as compared to that of the intergalactic medium. Using hydrodynamic simulations, we find that, at redshift z=10, the majority (up to 90%) of the high density gas, which has a density of more than 500 rhob, present in minihalos of mass 10^7 and 10^6 Msun, would remain with a metallicity lower than 3% of that of the intergalactic medium even when exposed to metal-enriched intergalactic shocks of velocities ranging from 10 to 100km\/s up to redshift z=6. This suggests that gas in such virialized minihalos may, when incorporated into larger halos, be a plentiful supply of primordial gas that has the potential to enable the formation of metal-free Population-III stars at a much lower redshift than anticipated from the enrichment of the intergalactic medium."}
{"text":"This study examines the scaling traits of Pyrex and silicon surfaces after bombarding them with alumina particles of two different average sizes ($29\\mu m$ and $9\\mu m$). Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (MFDFA) was employed to evaluate the singularity spectrum of the substrates. The results display that neither target material or particle sizes had an influence on the singularity spectrum, however for scales below $5 \\mu m$ fracture origins are largely in effect and generate long-range correlations which are responsible for the multifractal behaviour above this size. This investigation provides insight into the nature of the surface roughness of blasted substrates."}
{"text":"This article outlines a framework for analyzing the diffusive interaction of particles within the interphase cell nucleus. With the use of three different modeling approaches, such as generating random obstacle networks, employing a random-walk chain model, and developing a self-avoiding random-walk chain model, the influence of the network's 3D geometry on particle diffusion is explored. Through a comparison of discrete and continuous versions of the random-walk chain model, we observe that lattice discretization does not alter the diffusion of particles. Factors that do affect the diffusion are noted, such as adjacency of the monomers, the excluded volume effect, and to a lesser extent, the persistence length. The study culminates in the introduction of an effective chain occupancy which eliminates the conformational effects of the network on the diffusion, thus allowing for all data to be presented as a master curve when plotted on the diffusion coefficient vs effective chain volume."}
{"text":"\nWe conducted a 67 ks X-ray survey in the SA 57 area with XMM-Newton to examine the X-ray and optical properties of a population of AGNs, particularly of low-luminosity AGNs, as well as to detect diffuse and variable objects. Our resulting catalogue of 140 X-ray sources has a limiting flux of 5x10^-16, 2x10^-15 erg\/cm^2\/s in the 0.5-2 keV and 2-10 keV, respectively. We confirm the AGN nature of some of the optically-selected variables by their X-ray detection, however, only 25 out of 44 optically-selected quasars were detected. The results indicate that variable objects may be mostly low-lumiosity and 15% of all quasars in the field have X\/O<0.1."}

Depending on the parameters that are set, the structure of the resulting ADAF can be either thick-disk or thin-disk. Additionally, analytical expansion formulas for the singular points \u2013 the sonic and viscous points \u2013 are presented. Scholarly studies on transonic ADAFs usually involved an acausal viscosity, however, this methodology changes that by introducing the diffusion timescale."}
{"text":"\nThe purpose of this study is to look into the magnetic fields in the close vicinity of protostars utilizing Very-Long-Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) to detect any non-thermal centimetric radio emission. To this end, we conducted VLBI simulations on the four nearby protostars HL Tau, LDN 1551 IRS5, EC 95, and YLW 15. To maximise the potential sensitivity, we employed the High Sensitivity Array (HSA) that integrated the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA), the phased Very Large Array (VLA) as well as the Arecibo, Green Bank, and Effelsberg radio telescopes. Whilst all of the four protostars were identified in VLA-only data, only one source (YLW 15 VLA2) was observed in the VLBI data. We consider the likelihood of non-detections owing to free-free absorption, which may be contingent on the source geometry. It appears YLW 15 VLA2 is a fine prospect for the exact determination of its orbit."}

{"text":"\nWe investigate the gravitational dual of ``single-sector'' models of supersymmetry breaking which do not contain a messenger sector and, as a result, can provide a natural understanding of the scale of supersymmetry breaking as well as the fermion mass hierarchy. For this purpose, we utilize a metric background that deviates from the AdS_5 structure in the IR region to break supersymmetry, which is inspired by flux-background solutions of type IIB supergravity, while the spread of the fermions' wavefunctions towards the UV-confined Higgs field is responsible for the generation of the fermion mass hierarchy. The squarks and sleptons of the first and second generations, which are localized near the IR brane, immediately benefit from supersymmetry breaking as they gain mass of around 10 TeV. The gauginos and the squarks and sleptons of the third generation, on the other hand, are elementary states which gain 1 TeV soft masses according to loop radiations via direct gauge mediation. This collision of two different aspects of breaking supersymmetry results in a particular event frequency at the LHC which can easily be distinguished from conventional gravity and gauge mediation with 1-10 fb^{-1} of event data."}
{"text":"\nIn this paper, we report the observations of a large, unbiased sample of pulsars at 92 cm wavelength using the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope, and we compare them with the already published results at 21 cm. A total of 191 pulsars were studied utilizing fluctuation spectra, and a number of significant results were obtained. For instance, 15 pulsars previously unknown to be drifters were discovered, confirming 26 of the new drifters as mentioned in the 21-cm data. We also observed 8 sources with intermitting nulling, and 8 pulsars with briefly emitted single pulses of similar intensity to giant pulses. In all, it is estimated that at least half of the population of pulsars have drifting subpulses when observations of sufficient signal-to-noise ratio is available. Additionally, drifting subpulses are, in general, present at both frequencies, but it could be slightly more probable to detect them at 92 cm. Also, younger pulsars are observed to have more disorganized subpulses, which become more and more organized as the pulsar ages. The correlations with the modulation index support this theory, wherein the radio emission is divided into a drifting subpulse signal, as well as a quasi-steady signal which intensifies at higher frequencies. Lastly, the P3 values at both frequencies displayed a high degree of correlation but no correlation could be found with respect to other pulsar parameters."}
{"text":"This paper presents a space of quantum theory representations of the natural numbers N, integers I and rational numbers Ra. This space is parameterized by parameters denoted by 4-tuple points (k,m,h,g). Each point of the space labels a specific Fock space F^{X}_{k,m,h} of states with finite length strings of qukits q and a string state basis B^{X}_{k,m,h,g}. Maps on the parameter set result in transformations on the representation space, consisting of shifts, a base change operator W_{k',k}, and a basis or gauge transformation function U_{k}. The invariance of the properties of the natural, integer and rational numbers under any of these transformations is discussed, with an emphasis on the effect of prime factors on the operation of W_{k',k}. Under this light, the paper suggests that one should consider the prime number q's (e.g., q_{2}, q_{3}, q_{5}) as elemental and k q's as composites of these primes."}
{"text":"\nWe present the outcomes of sub-arcsecond mapping of the CO(1-0) and CO(2-1) emission of IRAS 10190+1322, reaching a resolution of ~0.3 arcsec, using the IRAM interferometer. This ULIRG is formed by two interacting galaxies, with a 6 kpc projected nuclear separation. This is the first time that the CO emission has been morphologically and kinematically resolved in both galaxies of a ULIRG, bar Arp 220. One of the galaxies contains a 1.7 kpc circumnuclear disk and the other a more extended disk of 7.4 kpc. The gas mass amounts to ~10% of the dynamical mass for each galaxy, totalling a molecular gas of around 4 10^9 Msun - enough for the system to engage in an infrared ultraluminous event."}

{"text":"\nThis study examines the mean prestellar lifetimes of magnetically supercritical, turbulent isothermal molecular clouds and compares them with observational estimations in numerical simulations. We measure the ratio of starless to stellar cores as a function of the density threshold n_thr used for definition and find that taking a value of t_yso = 0.46 Myr, these ratios are consistent with what has been observed. Additionally, we observe that failed core masses are significant at a lower density threshold, but diminish to insignificance at a higher threshold, supporting the idea that cores in general become gravitationally dominated. Lastly, it is found that timescale for core contraction and collapse is similar across models of subcritical, ambipolar-diffusive mediated star formation, turbulent supercritical clouds and intermediate models."}
{"text":"\nThe knowledge of mass loss rate on the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars is derived from both observational data and theoretical models. Numerous factors have been identified as major contributors to the atmospheric structure and mass loss rates, such as pulsation with piston amplitude scaling in accordance with the size of the star, dust nucleation and growth due to radiation pressure, as well as grain-gas interactions that are contingent on temperature and density. Modeling these prescriptive conditions has proven difficult, as it is complicated to construct a practicable model and accurate spectra. Although theoretical model grids can assist in the distinction between the effects of M,L,R,$T_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ or Z on the mass loss rates, they must be assessed against observations. It is necessary to compare the order of magnitude of the mass loss rate, though that is not enough to determine the correctness of the mass loss formula. Nonetheless, there are measurable factors that provide evidence to confirm or deny the accuracy of the mass loss formulae such as $d\\log \\dot M\/d\\log L$, $d\\log \\dot M\/d\\log R$, or $d\\log \\dot M\/d\\log P$."}
{"text":"This article examines the spectral fluctuations of tridiagonal random matrices from the beta-Hermite ensemble. Through Monte Carlo simulations, the variation of delta(n) and the autocorrelation function with n and the beta value have been documented. It is found that, for any positive beta, the higher-order moments of delta(n) conform to Gaussian distributions with variances that are linearly dependent on ln(n). Wavelet analysis further reveals that, while the spectral fluctuations approach a 1\/f^2 noise as beta approaches 0, a 1\/f noise remains consistent with positive beta values. In general, as a function of N, a 1\/f^2 noise is dominant at the lower scales and a 1\/f noise dominates at the higher scales."}
{"text":"\nThis study employed two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations in order to investigate the impact of heat conduction on the evolution of interstellar clouds within a hot plasma stream. Self-gravity, cooling and heating effects were also taken into consideration. The results of the simulations showed considerable differences depending on the presence or absence of heat conduction from the plasma stream. In simulations without thermal conduction, Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instabilities were the chief cause of a cloud's rapid destruction. When heat conduction was allowed, the temperature and density gradients around the edge of the cloud were significantly weakened. This lengthened the timescale for KH instabilities to arise and led to a decline in the cloud's vulnerability to KH instabilities. The effect was more pronounced for smaller and less massive clouds. Furthermore, hot material was transferred from the plasma onto the cloud's surface and mixed deeper into the cloud."}
{"text":"We report the results of a spectroscopic survey of Abell 1689 using HST's Advanced Camera for Surveys, detecting 98 redshifts. This brings the number of spectroscopically-confirmed objects up by a factor of six. We focus on a strongly-lensed Lyman Break Galaxy (LBG) residing at z=3.038, which is magnified by gravitational lensing into six distinct images. We observe two spectra of the Sextet Arcs, showing a variety of HI and interstellar metal absorption lines at their systemic redshift. The variations in the Ly-alpha profile are seen to vary from strong absorption to emission plus absorption when considering the same galaxy. Evidence has also been detected of two distinct regions of the LBG, or else two close companion galaxies, via Ly-alpha emission at the same redshift seen in a third spectrum of the brightest arc. The resulting Ly-alpha equivalent widths in the three spectra are seen to decrease as the equivalent widths of the strongest interstellar metals increase. This data allows us to further our understanding of the physical conditions in the LBG, which is known to be of low luminosity at 0.1L* and forming stars at around 4 solar masses per year. Additionally, two absorption line systems have been seen toward the Sextet Arcs at z=2.873 and z=2.534, with the latter system seen across two of the spectra."}
{"text":"In this research, we utilize two analytical methods, the testimator method and the Schwarz Information Criterion (SIC), to examine the linearity of the Large Magellanic Cloud Cepheid period-luminosity (P-L) relation. We demonstrate that the testimator approach is both unbiased and reduces the variance of the estimated slope. Applying SIC proves to be more conservative than the Akaike Information Criterion and usually opts for a lower order. We then apply these strategies to test simulated data sets to examine intrinsically linear or non-linear P-L relations. Ultimately, we apply the methods to independent LMC Cepheid data sets from the OGLE and MACHO projects, which exhibits changes in slope in the longer period ranges in all data sets, suggesting the non-linearity of the observed P-L correlation with a break period at approx. 10 days."}

{"text":"\nUsing Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) of the Hubble Space Telescope, we survey the spiral galaxy, M51, at wavelengths of F435W, F555W and F814W to accumulate and evaluate a considerable population of star clusters. We provide detailed measurements and analyses of the radius distribution and its associated parameters, i.e. arm\/interarm region, galactocentric distance, mass, age and colour. In total, 7698 star clusters from F435W, 6846 from F555W and 5024 from F814W are analyzed, with the median radius being 2.1pc. We observe a trend of radii increasing with colour and a higher prevalence of the redder clusters in the interarm regions. The relation between radius and galactocentric distance is, however, notably weaker than measured for old Milky Way globular clusters. Weakening correlations between cluster luminosity and radius are found, in contrast to the lack of correlation between cluster mass and radius. Additionally, six new \"faint fuzzy\" star clusters have been identified."}
{"text":"A comprehensive survey of 4867 galaxies within a 6.88$^2$ degree area of the NOAO Deep-Wide Field in Bo\\\"otes, observed at 8 microns, reveals a local (z<0.3) luminosity function.Analysis of the composition of the 8 micron luminosity has demonstrated that approximately 80% is truly attributed to dust emission (predominantly PAH), 19% originates from stellar photospheres, and around 1% can be attributed to AGN emission. The Schechter function provides an excellent fit to both the total 8 micron luminosity and the dust emission luminosity functions, with corresponding characteristic luminosities of 1.8 x 10^{10}$ \\Lsun and 1.6 x 10^{10}$ \\Lsun respectively. Furthermore, the average 8 micron luminosity density at z<0.3 is 3.1 x 10^7 \\Lsun Mpc^{-3}, most of which (2.5 x 10^7 \\Lsun Mpc^{-3}) is derived from dust emission. Overall, it appears that the majority of 8 micron luminosity at z<0.3 chiefly emerges from regular-sized galaxies, rather than LIRGs or ULIRGs."}
{"text":"\nIn this study, we measure the star formation rates of ~50,000 galaxies in the local universe (z~0.1) spanning from dwarf, gas-rich galaxies to massive ellipticals via dust-corrected observation of GALEX (UV) and SDSS (optical) photometry. We compare the UV-based SFRs to those found in SDSS H alpha results and make measurements of the specific SFR at different categories of galaxies such as star-forming galaxies, galaxies with AGN, and galaxies without H alpha emission. We find a narrow linear sequence of normal star-forming galaxies while AGN galaxies fall in-between star-forming and quiescent galaxies. Furthermore, we propose an evolutionary sequence that connects star-forming galaxies to quiescent ones and measure a UV-based cosmic SFR density of at z=0.1 that has a lower total error than previous analyses."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate the relation between velocity dispersion and optical richness for maxBCG galaxy clusters by looking into their distribution of galaxies in terms of position and velocity around the clusters' centers. Utilizing data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we note that the mean velocity dispersion is increasing from 202+\/-10 km\/s for smaller groups to 854+\/-102 km\/s for larger clusters. The scatter of this velocity correlation is measured to be within 40.5+\/-3.5%, decreasing to 14.9+\/-9.4% in the most plentiful bins. We also assess our methods on the C4 cluster catalog and simulation N-body models, confirming that our measurements relatively accurately capture the true values. By blending the scatter in velocity dispersion with the richness of the space density function, the velocity dispersion function of the maxBCG galaxy clusters is calculated. Even though velocity dispersion and richness are circumscribed as a mass-observable relation, it has been explored how their connectivity to masses is not too divergent and has limited scatter. Our findings thus establish a bridge between theory and observation and shed light on the velocity bias between dark matter and galaxies."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate the von Neumann and topological entropies of the toric code at finite temperatures for systems with both magnetic and electric excitations. We find that the entanglement entropy changes non-monotonically with respect to temperature and system size. The topological entropy then decreases to half its zero-temperature value at a finite temperature. In finite-size systems, this discontinuous behavior becomes smooth. We also identify the contribution of each type of energy excitation to the topological entropy and interpret the quantum topological order as arising from a combination of both magnetic and electric closed loop structures."}
{"text":"\nThis paper provides an atlas of the near-UV circumnuclear regions of 75 Seyfert galaxies, observed with the Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys at an average resolution of 10 pc. Our objective is to analyze the nature of the near-UV light and its relation to the starburst phenomenon in circumnuclear regions, and its impact on the evolution and growth of the central black hole and galaxy bulge. The information revealed by this atlas is used to classify the morphologies of the galaxies, measure the luminosity and sizes of their emitting regions, explore whether an unresolved nucleus is present, and identify any contributing stellar clusters. The sample size is sufficient for us to draw statistically robust conclusions about the differences between Seyfert 1 and Seyfert 2 galaxies. We find that Seyfert 1 galaxies are totally overtaken by their nuclei, which remain point-like even at the high resolution, while Seyfert 2 have almost no compact nucleus. Furthermore, stellar clusters appear to be slightly more frequent in Sy2 galaxies and make a greater contribution to the overall light compared to Sy1s, although this discrepancy is largely due to the bright, compact nucleus in the latter."}
{"text":"\nRecently, a strong connection has been made between certain kinematic characteristics of space-time in general relativity and the physics of acoustic perturbations in a dynamical fluid environment. An effective metric \u2013 referred to as the acoustic metric \u2013 can be constructed to capture the properties of curved space-time in general relativity. These physical models are known as \u2018analogue gravity models\u2019. The acoustic horizon, which has similarities to a black hole event horizon, is generated when acoustic perturbations propagate through an inhomogeneous transonic classical fluid. The acoustic horizon is a null hyper surface, and its generators are acoustic null geodesics, or phonons. The temperature of the acoustic radiation emitted from this horizon is similar to the actual Hawking radiation, and is called the analogue Hawking temperature. Accretion in astrophysics has been proposed as a classical analogue gravity model already present in the Universe, allowing further insight into the field of gravity."}
{"text":"\nIn this study, we present a method to reconstruct the connectivity of primate cortical networks from topological and spatial node properties. We determined that high reconstruction accuracy can be obtained both when taking into account the topological or spatially-based features of each area in the cortex. Additionally, when compared to the C. elegans neuronal network, the primate cortical network exhibited substantially better recovery from the applied node properties. The close relationship between area-based features and global connectivity suggests that certain developmental rules govern the organization of cortical networks. Further, the difference between the accuracy achieved by topological and spatial properties implies that network connectivity is not solely determined by spatial constraints."}
{"text":"This article examines the internal origin of spin echoes in dipolar solids when exposed to strong pi pulses. Various experiments have been conducted to explore possible extrinsic causes of the observed effects, all of which have been ruled out.

Further, visualization of the density matrix underlying the system showed a distinct flow of quantum coherence as a result of successive pi pulses."}
{"text":"\nIn this study, we numerically explore how the introduction of a polydisperse system can affect the disordering transitions and the resulting peak force necessary for the system to become unpinned. We see that in a binary system of Yukawa particles, a dispersity-induced disordering transition can coincide with an important growth in the necessary depinning threshold, commonly known as a peak effect. We observe that by incorporating particles which are not as easily pinned, the overall pinning strength of the system can be increased by intensifying the amount of topological disorder present. This effect is only valid for dispersities which create a considerable degree of topological disruption in a monodisperse system; under weaker disorder the addition of the poorly pinned species will create further disorder, yet not result in a peak force. We conclude that optimal pinning is achievable under topological defect densities of 0.2 to 0.25, and that weakly pinning systems are more susceptible to the peak effect than strong ones."}
{"text":"\nThis paper examines the Casimir effect for a 6D warped flux compactification model and its possible resolution to some long-standing problems. Specifically, the massless and minimally coupled scalar field is conceptually consistent with a 4D effective theory, which has a volume modulus that must be stabilised. We use a combination of zeta function regularisation and heat-kernel calculations to evaluate the one-loop effective potential of the modulus and find that it is analogous to Coleman-Weinberg potential. When the tuning of the degree of warping is close to the critical value, we can observe the desired mass ratio between two basic energies and a small, but negative, effective cosmological constant. This situation is a much less stringent fine-tuning than earlier models."}

Our\nnumerical simulations reveal that the ac dissipation is highly dependent on the\nrelative alignment of the ac and dc magnetic fields ($h_{ac}$ and $H_{dc}$).\nWhen $h_{ac}$ is in the same direction as $H_{dc}$, we observed that ac losses\nare significantly suppressed prior to any vortex penetration, and then make a\nlarge drop when the vortices enter the sample. When $h_{ac}$ is perpendicular\nto $H_{dc}$, the dissipation shows a jump but is comparatively smaller than\nthe parallel configuration. This behavior of the ac loss is in agreement with\nthe most recent results from microwave experiments using mesoscopic lithographed\nPb squares [J. Low Temp. Phys. 135, 119 (2004)]."}
{"text":"\nUsing cosmological three-dimensional adaptive mesh refinement simulations, we investigate the virialization of primordial baryon gas in early protogalaxies with temperatures of 10^4 K and their progenitors. We find that, without cooling, powerful shocks form close to the virial radius for material collapsing from voids. Cooling causes the postion of the shocks to shrink, allowing dense gas filaments to penetrate closer to the centre. In adiabatic simulations, gas temperatures decrease by a factor of two to form flat-entropy cores. In cooling halos, the gas reaches virial equilibrium with the dark matter potential due to its turbulent velocities with Mach numbers ranging from one to three. Even without any feedback processes, these velocities remain supersonic in the centres of the galaxies. The turbulent pressure dominates thermal energy, and the turbulent velocity distribution follows a Maxwellian pattern. Rotational velocities associated with the total angular momentum associated with these galaxies is small in comparison. Decomposing the velocity field using the Cauchy-Stokes theorem reveals vorticity around shocks, even in the centres of these protogalaxies."}
{"text":"\nWe are exploring a formulation of a spherically symmetric region of spacetime with an energy-momentum tensor decomposition [Phys. Rev. D, 75, 024031 (2007)]. Through this framework, we show how the system of equations governing a sphere of electromagnetic matter naturally reduces to the Reissner-Nordstrom spacetime when the region is in a vacuum state. We also reveal how, when using specific equations of state, the system can be simplified to the charged Vaidya spacetime. Furthermore, we discuss a collision of a charged fluid within a finite boundary, able to emit charged particles, into a Reissner-Nordstrom black hole. We present a model that allows us to study all parts of the collapsing region without the need to join separate areas together. As an example, we consider the collapse of a thin shell of electromagnetic material onto a Reissner-Nordstrom black hole. Lastly, we reduce our entire system to a static case and thus provide equations for the hydrostatic equilibrium of a charged fluid."}
{"text":"\nIn this study, we analyzed G-band images acquired by the Dunn Solar Telescope (DST) and filtergrams computed from two magneto-hydrodynamic simulation snapshots to compare the contrast of the quiet Sun. Our results show that the rms contrast of the best images we reconstructed was 14.1%, significantly lower than the total rms contrast of 21.5% indicated by the synthetic filtergrams. This leads us to believe that there are fundamental differences in G-band contrast between the real and simulated images. On the basis of a substantial reduction in granular contrast (16.3%) in the synthetic plage filtergrams, we propose that the quiet-Sun may possess a higher amount of weaker magnetic fields than previously assumed."}
{"text":"\nWe explore two-loop quantum corrections associated with AdS_5 x S^5 superstrings for a particular string configuration, related to a folded rotating string in AdS_5 in the ``long string'' limit. By employing the conformal gauge and various \\kappa-symmetry gauge choices, we ascertain the bosonic contribution to the effective action and the non-zero finite portion of the fermionic contribution. Notably, the bosonic and fermionic contributions to the string energy both amount to the Catalan's constant. The resultant value for the two-loop superstring prediction for the subleading coefficient a_2 in the scaling function aligns with the numerical value determined from the BES equation in hep-th\/0611135. This provides further confirmation of the exact structure of the Bethe ansatz underlying AdS\/CFT duality."}
{"text":"\nBy analyzing biochemical noise, we have established limits on the accuracy of determining position through concentration gradients from proteins with first-order reaction kinetics. Found in a variety of biological contexts, these gradients have been used to assign positions in cells and during development. Using single or double gradient systems, we have determined optimal lengths for maximizing positioning accuracy and the effect of different concentrations of proteins. Our findings can inform us of the upper-limit of precision that can be achieved in measuring position through protein gradients."}
{"text":"\nThis paper investigates the influence of a network's structure on the functioning of multiple identical but interconnected simple nonlinear dynamical systems exhibiting multiple stable stationary states, which are commonly used for modeling switch-like behavior in biological systems. It is shown that both an increase in the average degree and higher variance in the degree distribution across the nodes result in a higher tendency of the switches to act independently instead of cooperatively. Given the common occurrence of power-law degree distributions in biological networks, this paper proposes that the finding might help to identify any subnetworks that integrate the switches as comparatively low-degree and homogenous structures. In addition, the potential applications of these results to address ecological issues such as the integration of complexity and stability are discussed."}
{"text":"This article examines the potential for capacity enhancement when transmitter and receiver cooperation is employed in a two-transmitter, two-receiver network. First, orthogonal channels are utilized to exchange messages between the transmitters and also between the receivers. Then, dirty paper coding is utilized to enable the transmitters to generate joint encoding. Finally, Wyner-Ziv compress-and-forward is implemented over an analogous orthogonal receiver cooperation channel. Power allocation and bandwidth of both the data and cooperation channels is analyzed in order to identify the impact of the cost of cooperation. The findings show that the transmitters are able to outperform the receivers in terms of capacity enhancement under most conditions when the cooperation channel is strong. Weak cooperation channels may limit the effectiveness of the transmitter cooperation, in which case receiver cooperation is more beneficial. Finally, when the signal-to-noise ratio is low, a combination of transmitter and receiver cooperation has a greater capacity gain than transmitter cooperation alone, while at high SNR, transmitter cooperation offers the greatest amount of improvement."}
{"text":"\nThis study aims to assess personal archiving strategies for digital items located on the internet. Using data from a survey of people who have lost websites, combined with interviews, an overview is given of the kinds of sites people have lost, reasons for the loss and the subsequent practices they have adopted. It is found that despite the vast differences in physical location, the curation of internet-stored materials is similar to that of local materials \u2013 mainly relying on careless storage, episodic backups and randomly replicating documents. However, this research further illuminates the risks associated with internet-stored materials such as the spread of danger when records are kept on multiple hosts as well as the violations of expectations for permanent availability and notifications about deleted data. Additionally, it was determined that careless data storage can have much worse repercussions for digital materials stored online compared to those stored locally."}
{"text":"This paper introduces a new approach to solve the long-standing issue of quantile crossing. The proposed solution consists of sorting or rearranging an originally non-monotone curve into a chronically monotone curve. Evidence is also provided to demonstrate that the rearranged curve is more accurate than the original estimate when evaluated in finite samples. Furthermore, a functional delta method is applied to the rearranging operators, which allows us to derive functional limit theory for the entire rearranged curve and its properties. We also prove that bootstrapping is a valid way to approximate the limit law of the rearranged curves and related measures. Our results apply to all monotone econometric functions, such as production, distribution, and demand functions. Finally, an example from Vietnam veteran status and earnings are used to illustrate the theories."}
{"text":"\nThis field study investigated the archiving needs of consumers in relation to existing and emerging technologies, best practices, and policies with the aim of developing a service for the long-term storage, preservation, and access of digital belongings. Results showed that people have already lost irreplaceable digital artifacts, but frequently fail to implement backup and file replication strategies consistently. Analysis revealed four main themes of home computer users' archiving challenges, such as evaluating the worth of individual materials and managing files collectively. Four additional environmental factors disrupting archiving efforts included malware, consumer trust in digital systems, reliance on ad hoc IT providers, and the vulnerability of online storage. Our findings emphasize the importance of finding an effective way to curate, store and access digital belongings long-term in a consumer-friendly way."}
{"text":"\nUsing the Atacama Submillimeter Telescope Experiment, we conducted a comprehensive search for CO(J=3-2) emission from the host galaxy of GRB 980425. All 5 points of the galaxy were observed, and after combining the spectra, a global spectrum with an rms noise level of 3.3 mK in T_mb scale was obtained at a velocity resolution of 10 km s^-1. While no discernible emission was identified, a minimal signal in the velocity range corresponding to the redshift of the galaxy was identified. The derived 3 sigma upper limits on the properties of the global emission revealed an intensity of I_CO(3-2) < 0.26 K km s^-1, a molecular gas mass of M(H_2) < 3 x 10^8 M_sun, and a star formation rate of SFR < 0.1 M_sun yr^-1 - all of which are in agreement with past H_alpha and mid-IR observational results. This implies that there is no significant obscured star formation in the host galaxy of GRB 980425 and suggests a range of GRB hosts with respect to the presence of obscured star formation."}
{"text":"\nThis study examines the Ising dipole model as it relates to the dilute magnetic material LiHo_{x}Y_{1-x}F_4. Our calculations provide a value of 0.12 K for the nearest neighbor exchange interaction. Using Monte Carlo calculations, we are able to compute the boundary T_c(x) at which the ferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases occur. We further demonstrate that the linear decrease in T_c with increasing dilution is not as straightforward as originally thought, as fluctuations and the exchange interactions play a role in the behavior. We identify a critical dilution x_c=0.21(2) above which there appears to be no ordering. We fail to reproduce the experimentally-observed freezing of the spin glass in our simulations. We relate our results to the findings of Stephen and Aharony and plot their theory of finite-temperature freezing. Discrepancies between our work and experiments are discussed."}
{"text":"\nThis paper investigates the low-energy Dbar-N interaction through the development of a meson-exchange model with a one-gluon-exchange component at short range. We make use of SU(4) symmetry constraints to determine the inputs of the interaction, which are provided by vector mesons (rho and omega) exchange and higher-order box diagrams containing D*N, D\\Delta, and D*\\Delta intermediate states. The predicted cross sections for Dbar-N at excess energies of up to 150 MeV are approximately two times larger than those for KN interactions, with average values around 20 mb. We observe that omega-exchange plays a significant role in the Dbar-N interaction, and its interference with rho-exchange fixed by SU(4) symmetry helps determine the qualitative features of the interaction. These results are, in general, similar to those found for the KN interaction."}
{"text":"\nWe present a SU(4) bosonization approach to explore the quantum Hall ferromagnetic regime in graphene, characterized by filling factors \\nu = 0 and \\nu = \\pm. Our approach is based on a non-perturbative formalism for electrons with spin-1\/2 and pseudospin-1\/2 degrees of freedom, with attendant three phases of spin-pseudospin, spin, or pseudospin. We then derive the boson representation of the projected electron density, spin, pseudospin, and spin-pseudospin density operators. Applying the formalism to an effective continuous model, the dispersion relations of elementary neutral excitations are calculated. We further propose that the charged excitations (e.g. quantum Hall skyrmions) can be described by a coherent state of bosons and illustrate the semiclassical limit of the derived boson model in accordance with the findings of Arovas and co-workers. To conclude, the influence of SU(4) symmetry breaking terms in skyrmion energy is addressed."}
{"text":"This paper presents a new characterisation of Hamiltonian graphs by means of an f-cutset matrix. With this, an exact polynomial time algorithm for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is developed. This algorithm works with ordered weighted adjacency lists where paths or circuits are checked for shortest paths or circuits given a weighted graph of p vertices in a predefined sequence. The algorithm also accounts for scenarios with realistic maps of cities whereby cities are considered as points on a Euclidean plane. Additionally, a classical unstructured search algorithm and three new quantum algorithms which exponentially speed up the searching ability in an unstructured database are proposed. These algorithms are discussed in terms of their utility for NP-complete problems."}
{"text":"  This paper presents the first proper motion measurements of thin dust filaments observed in the central parsec around the supermassive black hole SgrA*. We show that the shape and motion of the filaments does not match the expected Keplerian motion in the gravitational potential of SgrA*. Using the NACO adaptive optics system at the ESO VLT, we measure the offsets between features with respect to their position in a reference epoch in order to determine the proper motions of filaments and two sources close to SgrA*. We propose that the formation and motion of the filaments may be related to an outflow coming from a disk of young mass-losing stars and\/or the black hole itself, which could be collimated."}
{"text":"\nWe have developed a novel empirical approach for calculating the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal (LPM) effects on virtual photon emission from quark-gluon plasma. To do this, we have extended the original model of generalized emission functions (GEF) to account for different temperatures and strong coupling strengths. In addition, the dynamical scaling variable $x_T$ and $x_L$ have been generalized to include the parameters $p_0, q_0, Q^2, T,   \\alpha_s$. Moreover, the GEF, $g^b_T, g^a_T, g^b_L, g^a_L$, have also been adapted for varying temperatures and couplings. This allows us to calculate the imaginary part of the photon polarization tensor as a function of photon mass and energy. To which end, we have put forth a phenomenological formula for the imaginary photon polarization tensor as a function of \\{$q_0, Q^2, T, \\alpha_s$\\}, to simplify experimental investigations."}
{"text":"\nAn in-depth analysis of the disk component of the Herbig Ae star HD97048 was conducted using diffraction-limited images taken by VISIR on the VLT at 8.6 and 11.3 microns. It was shown that the large flaring disk around this particular star is inclined to the line of sight. To evaluate the validity of the existing passive centrally irradiated hydrostatic disk models used for fitting the SEDs of Herbig Ae stars, the spatial distribution of PAH emission feature and adjacent continuum emission were compared to model predictions. The results showed that both the SED and the spatial distributions are in good agreement with the model predictions given common disk parameters. Hence, this study has offered evidence in support of the physical pictures behind the flared disk modelling."}
{"text":"\nWe now describe a multiwavelength study of IGR J16194-2810, a X-ray source recently identified as a new Symbiotic X-ray Binary (SyXB), a type of Low Mass X-ray Binary (LMXB) composed of a M-type giant and a compact object. Our findings from Swift\/XRT and INTEGRAL\/IBIS data pinpoint the optical counterpart, a M2 III star, and provide a description of the 0.5-200 keV spectrum with an absorbed Comptonization model, typical of LMXBs, and more specifically to SyXBs. Further analysis of the data yielded an estimated distance of 3.7 kpc and X-ray luminosity of 1.4e35 erg\/s in the 0.5-200 keV band. Comparisons to similar sources 4U 1700+24 and 4U 1954+31 showed this new SyXB to be similar, suggesting a compact object (possibly a neutron star) accreting from the wind of M-type companion. No long-term (days to months) periodicities were detected. Additionally, the XRT data did not provide enough coverage to explore the presence of X-ray short-term (seconds to hours) oscillations."}
{"text":" In this paper, the second part of a series, we explore the instabilities that can arise from longitudinal flows along magnetic flux tubes. Our linear stability analysis uncovers the conditions for the onset of Kelvin-Helmholtz and friction-driven instabilities, the presence of which depends upon input parameters such as the Alfv{\\'e}n speed, the densities of the internal and external medium, and the relative transverse velocity. In the stratified, or layered, external medium, the Kelvin-Helmholtz and the friction-driven instabilities can be triggered by flows significantly slower than the Alfv{\\'e}n speed. Dissipative effects below the thresholds for other instabilities can also lead to flow-driven instability. These insights have implications for magnetic field storage in stellar convection zones and astrophyiscial jets."}
{"text":"\nWe studied the properties of cosmological simulations which consist of particles causally displaced from an ideal lattice, subject to their own gravitational fields. We present a new set of perturbative equations which, up to shell crossing, quantify the effects of discreteness on the N-body simulations. Our approximation predicts that initial red-shifts of finite particle densities will reduce the growth of power in comparison to the fluid limit, generally by about 10% of the Nyquist frequency, and slightly modify its dispersion as it evolves. While contrary to the general intuition, our analysis shows that a higher initial red-shift actually produces a worse result than a lower one. We also analysed how the discreteness effects are altered when the errors due to two-body collisions are lowered. While smoothing the force was found to decrease the anisotropy, it is shown to enhances the average discreteness effect, due to a time relationship $N^{2\/3}$ between the collisionless and collisional regimes, in contrast with the relationship $N \/ \\log N$ predicted in the former case."}
{"text":"\nIn this thesis, we demonstrate a comprehensive technique for understanding and analyzing complex networks, utilizing statistical mechanics as a foundation. This approach holds the statistical ensemble of networks as the central concept. By applying theoretical tools and methods from statistical mechanics, we outline the development and growth of networks such as the Internet, neural networks, and transportation networks. We also uncover finite-size corrections and further investigate the dynamics of a model involving the transport of mass over these networks. This interdisciplinary field, combining physics, computer sciences, biology, and other areas, has emerged recently. As a result, our academic endeavor serves to unlock the underlying general principles governing these elaborate systems."}
{"text":"\nThe estimation of parameters and selection between a set of models for an astronomical data can be challenging tasks due to the presence of multimodal posterior distributions and degeneracies. These difficulties can be counteracted with the usage of the nested sampling method proposed by Skilling (2004), which has shown effectiveness in cosmological applications and reduces computational expense. Shaw et al. (2007) introduced a clustered nested sampling method which is more efficient in sampling from multimodal distribution and calculating evidence. This paper provides further development of their method through three additional approaches to sampling and evidence evaluation for distributions containing many modes or degeneracies. These methods considerably reduce the computational burden in accuracy estimation and parameter estimation and are validated with toy problems. Finally, the application of these methods to Bayesian object detection in astronomical datasets is discussed."}
{"text":"\nThis article explores the potential utility of network statistics in exploring early English syntax. With an emphasis on structural criteria, the paper assesses the possibility of using networks to analyze the language production of children. It proposes that networks can capture global patterns of grammatical usage as opposed to intrinsic features of grammar, allowing for the creation and analysis of a corpus of annotated texts. Guidelines are provided for building networks using projections of syntactic relations in early language, along with a methodology for completing the annotation process in a way that equips statisticians to do research on the size of structures, as well as assess the overall complexity presented. An example is given to illustrate the steps taken."}
{"text":"This article performs a comprehensive assessment of more than 250 ab initio potential energy surfaces (PESs) of the model dipeptide HCO\u2013L\u2013Ala\u2013NH2 employing homo- and heterolevel model chemistries (MCs). We employed Pople's split-valence families from the 3-21G to 6-311++G(2df,2pd) basis sets. The RHF and MP2 calculations for the geometry and energy were used to generate the reference PES, which is supposed to be the most accurate PES of a dipeptide in the literature. Our aim is to gain insight into the influence of polarization and diffuse functions in the basis set as well as the usage of heterolevel approximation as opposed to a homolevel MC. All datasets have been analyzed and compared according to their nearness in the space of MCs. This experiment is the first to extensively evaluate the efficacy of the heterolevel approximation on full PESs."}
{"text":"\nThis study examines the afterglows of ten gamma-ray bursts observed by BeppoSax, in order to constrain both their blastwave parameters and the medium within which they occur. Through simultaneous fits to the afterglow's X-ray, optical, and near-infrared data, this paper examines the properties of the electron energy distribution index, p, and the density structure index of the environment, k. Comparing this data to previously observed optical and x-ray temporal behaviour, the results indicate that the p values are statistically unlikely to be universally consistent, which may have implications for particle acceleration models. The results of our analysis reveal five GRBs whose circumburst environments may be characterized by different density structures; four of these appear wind-like, and the fifth may be homogenous."}
{"text":"We examine the implications of our conjecture with respect to Dyson indices, \nHilbert-Schmidt separability probabilities, and Beta function ansatze for \nreal and complex two-qubit states, qutrits, and higher-dimensional states. We \nfind that our conjectured relation of separability probabilities to Dyson \nindices is in accord with random matrix theory, as demonstrated in the studies \nof the real and complex qubit-qutrit cases. Moreover, the conjectured \nseparability functions based on Beta functions are further supported in \nnumerical and theoretical analyses, as well as studies involving higher \ndimensional real and complex states."}
{"text":"This article discusses a mathematical model of biochemical pathways integral to late long-term potentiation (L-LTP) which helps explain memory formation and maintenance. It investigates how recurrent neuronal activity, experienced during memory recall or sleeping, can preferentially strengthen synapses and preserve memories for months or years. Two models are discussed, representing synaptic tagging, gene induction, and kinase activation by calcium that is modeled as continual brief elevations in concentration. The results demonstrate a positive feedback between synaptic weight and activity amplitudes, promoting two stable states of synaptic weight. A tetanic or theta-burst stimulus can switch a model synapse from a low weight to a high weight which is maintained by ongoing activity. Furthermore, decreased activity can reset synapses to the low weight state. Thus, this model offers a plausible explanation of forgetting and provides predictive tests of the coupling of neuronal activity to synaptic strength."}
{"text":"\nThis article uses an effective field theory (EFT) mapping the interactions of three nucleons to assess how a selection of three-nucleon observables alter depending on the pion mass. The input quantities given to our \"pionless\" EFT come from a recent calculation of chiral EFT that shows the inverse 1S0 and 3S1 scattering length approaching zero at the 'critical' pion mass of 197.8577 MeV. The binding energies of these states are computed to next-to-next-to-leading order in the pionless EFT and inspected in regards to the pion mass near the 'critical' value. Additionally, the pionmass EFT predicts the doublet and quartet scattering lengths for the disagreement between the physical pion mass and the 'critical' pion mass."}
{"text":"\nThe present study investigates the primordial evolution of complexity through an examination of a soup of finitary and discrete processes, labeled $\\epsilon$-machines. These processes create interactions between networks that, due to specific definitions of structure, grant quantitative representation of self-organizational hierarchies. Results indicate that replicating processes in the soup advance complexity by building levelsof organization through autocatalysis, inspiring a selection pressure for components with low structural complexity and high generality. Thus, the finitary process soup allows for the presentation of a fundamental law for hierarchical systems: global complexity necessitates local simplicity."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate the possible line-of-sight acceleration of a C IV broad absorption trough in a quasar, SDSS J024221.87+004912.6. Combining two other outflowing systems constrains the properties of the outflows. Observations of the residual flux in an overlapping trough provide evidence for structures in both systems consisting of individual subunits, either opaque, spherical clouds with radius r = 3.9 10^15 cm or opaque, linear filaments with width w = 6.5 10^14 cm, which cover the Mg II broad emission line region of the quasar. This suggests that the accretion disk can be a source of quasar absorption systems, as the latter's width is equal to the scale height of the thin accretion disk at the same distance."}
{"text":"This article presents two approaches for deriving the closure of the turbulent\nsubgrid-scale stress tensor in terms of matrix exponentials. The first approach\nemploys a formal solution of the stress transport equation, integrating the\nproduction terms exactly as matrix exponentials. While this method enables\nexploring special cases, it fails to account for pressure-strain correlations\nor diffusion effects. The second approach is based on an Eulerian-Lagrangian\nanalysis, assuming isotropy of the conditionally averaged Lagrangian velocity\ngradient tensor and using the RFD approximation. Results for both approaches\nmanifest as the product of the matrix exponential of the resolved velocity\ngradient tensor and its transpose. Short-time expansions of the matrix\nexponentials allow for the interpretative reexpression of traditional eddy-viscosity\nand nonlinear stress closures. An implementation of the matrix-exponential\nclosure was successful in Large Eddy Simulations of forced isotropic\nturbulence, though this method drastically omits the pressure-strain correlation\nas well as other nonlinear scrambling terms. The matrix-exponential closure\nprovides a local and physically motivated solution of the subgrid-scale stress\ntransport equation, derived directly from its production term."}
{"text":"This article presents a study of the resummation of the double log terms $\\ln^2 x$ in the collinear factorization of the form factor for the transition $\\gamma^* \\pi^0 \\to \\gamma$. We introduce a nonstandard light-cone wave function and a jet factor to factorize the $\\ln^2 x$ term in the form factor and show that these objects have extra scales to characterize their $x$-behaviors. We then leverage the evolutions of the extra scales and the relation of these two wave functions to do the resummation perturbatively. Our results demonstrate that a significant difference exists between the numerical predictions with and without resummation, and that the resummed values can more accurately fit the available experimental data."}
{"text":"In this article, we provide an analysis of NLO corrections to exclusive processes when employing $k_T$ factorization theorem by examining the example of $\\pi\\gamma^*\\to\\gamma$. This exploration consists of incorporating off-shell partons with $k_T^2$ both in the quark diagrams from full QCD and in the effective diagrams for the pion wave function, in order to formulate a $k_T$-dependent hard kernel through the cancellation of gauge dependences. The validity of the hard kernel is subsequently proved to all orders using induction. Besides, the light-cone singularities in the $k_T$-dependent pion wave function are regularized by shifting the Wilson lines from the light cone, which results in factorization-scheme dependent hard kernel that can be minimized. Furthermore, large amounts of double logarithms $\\ln^2k_T$ and $\\ln^2 x$ manifest in the loop correction to the virtual photon vertex, the former of which is managed by $k_T$ resummation and the latter by threshold resummation. Our findings show that the NLO corrections to $\\pi\\gamma^*\\to\\gamma$ are slightly above several percent when the factorization scale is set to the momentum transfer from the virtual photon."}
{"text":"\nWe use the Gaussian-basis Monte Carlo method (GBMC), developed by Corney and Drummond, to explore the behavior of itinerant and strongly correlated electron systems. This method is beneficial because of its use of the coherent Gaussian-type operator basis Lambda and its lack of the minus sign problem. In spite of this, the original technique was often unsuccessful in depicting the exact ground state, as well as calculating physical quantities, as the samples were often restricted to some metastable or symmetry-broken states. In order to file this difficulty, we incorporate Assaad, Werner, Corboz, Gull and Troyer's quantum-number projection scheme with the importance sampling of the GBMC. This improvement gives promising results. Our method shortens the calculation and allows the exploration of a wider range of parameters that were normally practical or limited due to system size and interaction strength. In conclusion, our study grants a dependable and effective approach in computing for highly correlated electron systems that is initially impractical for quantum Monte Carlo and other related methods."}
{"text":"This research provides valuable insights into the nature of the work function, which is the amount of energy required for electrons to escape from a metal surface. The authors analyse the energy distribution of electrons, which have been confined to the metal surface. By experimentally measuring the emitted electrons, the authors observe sharp structures with thresholds that increase linearly with free electron density, a finding which can be explained by the Hartree-Fock exchange energy. The results, unexpectedly, violate the Einstein-Millikan equation associated with the photoelectric effect. Drawing on discrimination between energies and momentums, the researchers conclude that emissions are triggered by photon momentum and indicate a phase transition connecting a surface-bound to a free continuum state. The data is found to be in line with theoretical predictions, which support a purported abrupt increase in the number of electrons in the continuum by over 70 orders of magnitude."}
{"text":"\nThis paper proposes the annular gap acceleration model as a potential explanation for $\\gamma$-rays emitted from pulsars. This model takes into account the differences in potential drop found in the annular and core regions of a pulsar, which allows for both positive and negative charges to be accelerated independently. This in turn can lead to peculiar emission beams and solve the current closure problem that has posed challenges for other models. In the annular gap acceleration model, the advantages of both polar cap and outer gap models are maintained, and the geometry of the $\\gamma$-ray emission matches well with the observations."}
{"text":"This work presents an evaluation of radiative transition rates, along with electron impact excitation rate coefficients, for levels of the n = 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 configurations of Ca II. The radiative data was generated utilizing the Thomas-Fermi-Dirac central potential method in the frozen core approximation with a model potential to factor in the polarization interaction between the valence electron and the core. This approach allows for relativistic effects and CI to be incorporated in the Breit-Pauli formulation. Close coupling calculations in the LS-coupling scheme were conducted with the R-matrix method and refined to factor in spin-orbit coupling effects with the intermediate-coupling frame transformation method. Comparisons with other recent determinations and measurements of Ca II are shown, along with a comparison between core polarization outcomes and \"unpolarized\" values. Analysis showed that core polarization can affect the calclulated lifetimes by a maximum 20%. Effective collision strengths were derived from a Maxwellian distribution of electron energies at various temperatures, with a ~11% difference from earlier measurements but discrepancies with others using the distorted wave approximation."}
{"text":"\nThis study extends previous gene duplication and rewiring models by accounting for directions and the fact that molecular networks are not the result of unidirectional growth. We introduce upstream sites and downstream shapes to quantify potential connections during duplication and rewiring, and demonstrate that these can result in the scaling of transcription factors for genome sites in prokaryotes. Using a dynamical model, we generate a scale-free degree distribution with an exponent &gamma;=1 in the non-growing case, and &gamma;>1 when the network is growing. Our analysis reveals that duplication of genes significantly influenced by recombination of upstream regions could contribute to the main characteristics of genetic regulatory networks. Nonetheless, the steady state degree distribution is too broad according to datasets - suggesting that selective pruning may still pose a considerable barrier for duplicated genes."}
{"text":"\nThis research evaluates the effectiveness of the Relativistic Schr\\\"odinger Theory (RST) when applied to atomic physics by analyzing the positronium groundstate. The study neglects any magnetic interactions between the positron and the electron. The RST prediction on the groundstate energy, which approximately equates to -6,48 eV, deviates from the conventional Schr\\\"odinger Theory\u2019s calculation of -6,80 eV by 0.32 eV. This discrepancy is attributed to the use of a SO(3) symmetric interaction potential instead of the anisotropic one due to the SO(2) symmetry which would be more accurate for RST. This suggests that, with the correct and more precise use of the interaction potential, the RST results will likely be closer to the conventional results, taking into account the exotic, double-valued wave functions and the relevant unconventional interaction potentials such as the Struve-Neumann potential."}
{"text":"\nA mysterious feature of NGC6908, thought to be merely a surface-brightness enhancement, has been revealed through a near-infrared study. The further examination of this feature has led to the conclusion that it is an S0(6\/7) lenticular galaxy, as evidenced by the equal emission velocities of NGC6908 and NGC6907 sharing a distance. It is now known that the previously observed asymmetries of NGC6907 are a consequence of a merging event that have left visible tails and debris, making this pair of galaxies an excellent example of two objects that were previously misunderstood until the aid of infrared imaging presented a clearer view. With this understanding, the exploration of other similar samples is encouraged in hopes of further uncovering previously obscured merger events."}
{"text":"\nWithin this article, a study is conducted to obtain analytic asymptotic expressions of the thermal Casimir free energy, pressure, and entropy at low temperatures in the configuration of one metal and one dielectric plate. To do so, perturbation theory is employed, taking into consideration the product of plate separation and temperature as the small parameter. Numerical computations are compared with the theoretical results and are found to match, revealing that the Lifshitz theory applied to the metal-dielectric set-up satisfies the rules of thermodynamics as long as the static dielectric permittivity is not infinite. It is concluded that Matsubara's formulation of quantum field theory must be adapted if the dielectric permittivity is infinitely large, and corresponding implications for measurements of the Casimir force between metal and semiconductor surfaces are discussed."}
{"text":"\nThe non-coding DNA (98.5% of human genomes) has largely unknown functions (1-5). Recent research has shown that this 'dark matter' of the genome serves to program accurate adaptation to rapidly changing environments in a universal way across all non-competing animals, from yeast to humans (6-21). Removing non-coding fractions of animal genomes may help to uncover the contribution of these programs of adaptation to genomic programming. New forms of adaptation and their hereditary patterns (non-Mendelian) may be studied in mini-extinctions caused by antibiotic treatments (22-24). The data suggest that rapid universal adaptation has been fundamental for the survival of different species since the major mass extinction events of the past (25-28). This hypothesis is both evolutionary and experimentally confirmed (6-21, 29-32). These results point to a biological universality across species which justifies the use of animal models for humans. Additionally, genomic adaptation programs require an unconventional methodology for their investigation, opening up exciting new possibilities for directed biological changes."}
{"text":"\nIn this work, we explore the gauge symmetry of a spin-$\\frac{1}2$ model on a honeycomb lattice, which is based on Kitaev model. The topological phases of the system are studied by looking into its ground state sector, the vortex-free states. It is found there are two fundamental phases, labeled as A and B, whose nature can be revealed by mapping onto a p-wave paired states of spinless fermions with adjustable pairing parameters in a square lattice. The A phase is seen to be the strong pairing phase, an insulating stage, and the B phase can be gapped or gapless based on the broken or preserved generalized inversion symmetry. The gapped B phase is further shown to be the weak pairing phase, either described by Moore-Read Pfaffian state of spinless fermions or anti-Pfaffian state of holes depending on the sign of the next nearest neighbor hopping amplitude. In addition, we discover the hidden SU(2) gauge symmetry in the model. The gapped B phase has a special topological number, the spectral first Chern number or the chiral central charge, which indicates the chiral anomaly of the edge state. This anomaly is identified as the reduced Eta-invariant and can be eliminated by a Wess-Zumino term of SO(3) group through an index theorem in 2+1 dimensions."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate how a collisionless relativistic electron-positron shock, initially unmagnetized, evolves magnetically over time. Our two-dimensional particle-in-cell numerical simulations depict a downstream particle distribution close to an isotropic relativistic Maxwellian, accompanied by an intermittent spatial configuration of non-propagating magnetic fields, which measure at most to $\\sim 0.1-0.2$ of the upstream kinetic energy within the shock transition. These structures decrease in intensity consistently, with limited merging further downstream. Following the decay, the magnetic energy density drops below $10^{-3}$ of equipartition after one thousand skin depths. To explain this downward trajectory, we hypothesize that the damping is essentially a version of Landau damping in a nonmagnetized environment. Drawing upon linear kinetic theory, we arrive at an analytic formulation of the damping rate in two and three dimensions. The results demonstrate that the magnetic energy diminishes exponentially as $(\\omega_p t)^{-q}$ with $q \\sim 1$."}

{"text":"This paper examines the effect of an electric charge on a two-dimensional plasma sheet, with the aim to analyze the behavior of the electron field in a carbon nanotube or $C_{60}$ molecule. It shows that through integration of the plasma displacement field or the electromagnetic field, different results regarding the Casimir energy can be derived. Moreover, by utilizing the covariant gauge for the electromagnetic field, it is demonstrated that the effects of the plasma sheet can be demonstrated through matching conditions that differ from the ones usually applied. The difference between the treatments does not produce an effect on the Casimir force between two sheets, but it is evident in the Casimir-Polder force between a charge or atom and a sheet. The paper also sheds light on the physics of conductor boundary conditions, particularly the difference between 'thin' and 'thick' bounds."}
{"text":"The study of Grassmann Algebras has revealed the fundamental nature of skew derivations over ordinary derivations.

{"text":"\nUsing large-scale three-dimensional simulations at multiple grid resolutions, we explore the statistical aspects of driven, isothermal supersonic turbulence. We employ the piecewise parabolic method to reach Mach numbers of 6 and discuss resolution issues, before demonstrating convergence of the inertial range. Our findings show that the velocity scaling coefficients of this strongly compressible system are quite distinct from those of incompressible turbulence, while density-weighted velocity scaling appears to be independent from overall Mach number. We report direct measurements of the mass fractal dimension of the density subrange, measuring at 2.4, which agrees with prior investigations. Ultimately, our work uses statistical measurements to pave the way for longer-term physical understanding of supersonic turbulence."}
{"text":"\nBy using molecular dynamics simulations, this article investigates the fluidization of a vertically oscillated, three dimensional shallow granular layer. When the container acceleration is greater than the gravitational acceleration of the layer, the granular temperature and particle displacement gradually increase, leading to a total fluidization of the layer through the observable macroscopic phenomena, such as convection rolls and surface waves. Modifications to the layer can be made in order to adjust and lessen the magnitude of the jump when the layer is fully fluidized, such as lowering the restitution coefficient and increasing the total number of particles. Additionally, increasing the frequency of oscillation will also reduce the magnitude of the jump, and shift the change to lower accelerations."}
{"text":"\nThe proper regulation of excitatory synaptic transmission relies heavily on the trafficking of glutamate receptors in and out of synapses. Reproduction by endocytosis and exocytosis of these receptors had earlier been thought to be the only mechanism of such trafficking. However, a more multifaceted approach has been realized through various motion-tracking techniques that demonstrated the diffusion of glutamate receptors on the neuronal plasma membrane. The use of pH-sensitive fluorescent proteins and photoactivatable drugs, as well as single molecule fluorescent microscopy have enabled the live observation of receptor surface trafficking within and outside of synapses. Examination of these findings concluded that these receptors traverse the neuronal membrane at an impressive speed and play a major role in controlling the amount of receptors at the synapses."}

By utilizing fluorescent protein markers, trajectories of individual molecules were examined in real-time to determine the diffusion rate in live cells from 5 to 200 ms. An estimated 30-40% of the molecules showed localized diffusion in domains with a size of 200 nm. Further experiments on actin and cholesterol extraction revealed that the domain structures are not present in standard membrane domains thus far seen."}
{"text":"\nThrough single-molecule fluorescence microscopy, we have imaged the lateral movement of AMPA receptors inside and outside individual synapses in live neurons. We observed some immobile and mobile receptors, with the latter displaying restricted diffusion. Receptors were found to exchange between the synapse and the extra-synaptic region through lateral diffusion. Evidence suggests that the activity of inhibitory transmission and glutamate application regulate this movement by increasing receptor mobility inside the synapse and the amount of mobile receptors present in the juxtasynaptic region. Our research demonstrates that rapid exchange of receptors between the synaptic and extra-synaptic locations can be regulated by receptor diffusion within the synapse."}
{"text":"\nNumerical analysis of a gonihedric model in 2+1 dimensions reveals its multicriticality features. This model is a fully frustrated Ising magnet with a combination of four-body and plaquette-diagonal interactions, which eliminate domain-wall surface tension. Taking into account quantum-mechanical fluctuations in the imaginary-time direction, the criticality of the (2+1)-dimensional gonihedric model is an anisotropic one; therefore, real-space and imaginary-time critical indices differ. To investigate the criticality further, we extend the parameter space to control domain-wall surface tension, utilizing the crossover (multicritical) scaling theory. With the aid of numerical diagonalization for clusters of up to 28 spins, the correlation-length critical indices (\\nu_\\perp,\\nu_\\parallel) and the crossover exponent \\phi were found to be 0.45(10), 1.04(27), and 0.7(2) respectively. These values are consistent with the (d,m)=(3,2) Lifshitz point predictions acquired using \\epsilon-expansion up to O(\\epsilon^2)."}
{"text":"\n\nThis article examines the Kondo effect present in an electron system linked to a local optical phonon through analysis of the Anderson-Holstein model using a numerical renormalization group (NRG) method. Conducting the analysis reveals three distinct regions dependent on the balance between the Coulomb interaction $U_{\\rm ee}$ and phonon-mediated attraction $U_{\\rm ph}$. When $U_{\\rm ee} > U_{\\rm ph}$ is observed, a standard Kondo effect related to the spin degree of freedom is observable, and the corresponding Kondo temperature, $T_{\\rm K}$, is increased with increasing $U_{\\rm ph}$. On the other hand, if $U_{\\rm ee} < U_{\\rm ph}$ is observed, a Kondo effect related to the charge degree of freedom is present, caused by the roles played by vacant and double occupied states in forming a kind of pseudo-spins. In this instance, $T_{\\rm K}$ is found to decrease with increasing $U_{\\rm ph}$. This leads to the conclusion that $T_{\\rm K}$ is maximized when $U_{\\rm ee}$ is roughly equal to $U_{\\rm ph}$. Further analysis of the Kondo behavior in this case reveals that the polaron Anderson model with a decreased hybridization of polarons and a reduced repulsive interaction among them best explain it. Finally, comparing the NRG results of the polaron Anderson model to those of the original Anderson-Holstein model reveals the Kondo behavior in the region where $U_{\\rm ee}$ and $U_{\\rm ph}$ are approximately equal."}
{"text":"A game-theoretic perspective is applied to evaluate the influence of the size of a transmission\nconstellation on the energy efficiency of M-QAM modulation in CDMA networks with time-delay specifications. A non-cooperative game provides an environment wherein each user can select the transmission power and possible symbol rate, as well as the constellation size that maximizes their own utility, as long as their Quality-of-Service (QoS) delay requirements are fulfilled. This utility is calculated in terms of reliable bits per energy joule used and makes the framework appropriate for energy-tight networks. The advantageousness of a constellation and the Nash equilibrium, along with best-response strategies, were all determined. Results suggested that the user should choose the smallest constellation that can meet their delay instruction if they want to maximize the utility (bits per joule). This framework also allows for an examination of the relations between energy efficiency, delay, constellation size and throughput and provides understanding for the effect of trellis-coded modulation on energy efficiency."}
{"text":"\nThe impact of energy constraints on quality of service is investigated in this paper using a game-theoretic model of joint power and rate control. Each user makes its own decisions on appropriate transmit power and rate, in a distributed fashion, in order to maximize its own utility while meeting quality of service constraints. The latency and average source rate are set as parameters of the user's quality of service and an upper bound on the average delay is prescribed. An energy-efficient utility function is adopted to measure the performance, and analytical expressions are given for the Nash equilibrium solution as well as the users' own delays at the equilibrium. Capacity and throughput are also studied in detail for their tradeoff behaviour with delay, energy efficiency, and network resources."}

This approach is applicable to a range of multiuser receivers, including the matched filter, decorrelator, linear minimum mean-square error receiver, and optimal detectors. It exploits the linear relation between power and output signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio in large systems, demonstrating that selfish users will seek SIR-balanced equilibriums. The power control algorithm is shown to converge for the matched filter, decorrelator, and MMSE receiver when calculating multiuser efficiency through the iterative process, free from the user's instantaneous spreading sequences. Its performance is tested and compared to conventional power control in finite-size systems."}
{"text":"\nBy conducting a two-epoch observational study of a Galactic Bulge sky region, we analyze the precision of astrometric measurements by FORS1 on the VLT. To make sure the readings are not impacted by atmospheric image motion, we make use of a special technique and utilize bright, unsaturated stars of magnitude between 18 to 19. Statistical testing reveals that the positional astrometric precision is mainly restricted by the ability to determine star photocenters. We find the residual noise of measured positions is essentially a white noise that follows a Gaussian distribution. After analyzing the data for time-scales of 1-4 nights, we also conclude that there is evidence of a good astrometric quality of the VLT that can reach up to 30-50 microarcsec for 50 frames with a R filter over one hour."}
{"text":"This article is a continuation of our previous study on the classification of finite dimensional complex filiform Leibniz algebras. We explore two main resources in order to obtain a classification of these algebras: naturally graded none Lie filiform Leibniz algebras and naturally graded filiform Lie algebras. From the first resource, two distinct classes of filiform Leibniz algebras are identified. This paper focuses on the second class and an algebraic approach relying on invariants is proposed to carry out the classification. Applying the technique to low dimensional cases results in a systematic classification of filiform Leibniz algebras and the outcomes are also applicable to the geometric classification of the orbits of said algebras."}
{"text":"\nThis paper addresses two distinct classes of spherically symmetric exact solutions that represent charged masses in conjunction with both gravitational and electromagnetic fields in the Tetrad Theory of Gravitation.

This hypothesis is supported by outflow surveys and mid-IR imaging with high angular resolution of maser environments."}

{"text":"\n By considering cascades, the effect of absorption by background infrared photons on high-energy gamma-rays is revisited. This cascading process involves the production of e+e- pairs which can interact with background photons and upscatter them to high energies, initiating a further cascade of pairs. The created pairs diffuse on the extragalactic magnetic field, allowing for an alternative means of measuring its intensity.  Analysis of the TeV observation of distant blazar 1ES 1101-232 is used to put an upper limit on the infrared extragalactic background light density and consider the spectral shape of the observed 100 MeV to 100 TeV.  An intrinsic spectrum given by a power law is assumed and it is found that the spectrum has a softer shape when taking into account the cascading emission. The upper limit on the IR background is found to be robust and the contribution of cascade emission to the observed spectrum is seen to be negligible for EMF intensities of 1e-8 nG. The correspondingly derived intrinsic spectra that fit the TeV data are seen to be unrealistically hard."}

Results from simulations of isolated clusters were found to be comparable to those from more traditional stellar population synthesis codes, whereas simulations of clusters in tidal fields showed that their integrated colors became relatively bluer due to energy equipartition impacts.

{"text":"\nThe present study investigates the properties of linearized perturbations in magnetized plasma flows featuring a constant shearing rate with gravity-induced stratification. The two-dimensional case is explored in detail and, applying the Boussinesq approximation, the generation and over-reflection of Gravito-Alfven waves (GAW) and Entropy Mode (EM) perturbations are examined. It is revealed that for certain flows over a finite period of time there exist potentially non-adiabatic properties, including the aforementioned GAW over-reflection and GAW generation from EM perturbations. Furthermore, the transformation of the equilibrium flow energy into the energy of the perturbations is more efficient than expected, even for moderate and high shearing rates. The observed process takes place for a shearing rate an order of magnitude smaller than that typically necessary for the development of a shear instability. The importance of this outcome could have major implications for properly understanding the dynamics of angular momentum redistribution in solar and solar-type stars."}
{"text":"\nThis article explores how the observed three-dimensional HI volume density distribution of the Milky Way out to a galactocentric distance of 40 kpc and a height of 20 kpc can be used to determine the Galactic mass distribution in order to shed light on dark matter models. By applying the Leiden\/Argentine\/Bonn all sky 21-cm line survey in combination with different rotation curves, several models of a self-gravitating isothermal gas disk are generated. The resulting model reveals a massive extended halo with a mass of 1.8 x 10^12 Msun and a sizeable self-gravitating dark matter disk with a mass of 2-3 x 10^11 Msun, including a dark matter ring with a mass of 2.2-2.8 x 10^10 Msun which is located between 13 and 18.5 kpc. Additionally, the Milky Way rotation curve remains flat up to 27 kpc and then slowly decreases outward. This model will allow us to further investigate the plausibility of a past mergeral of a dwarf galaxy with the Milky Way, the potential formation of a massive disk due to a similar event, and additional insights into the Dark Matter in the Milky Way."}
{"text":"The purpose of the KArlsruhe TRItium Neutrino (KATRIN) experiment is to accurately measure the absolute neutrino mass scale, down to 0.2eV with less model-dependency than traditional cosmological or neutrinoless double beta decay methods. The endpoint of molecular tritium decay is used as a free parameter to fit the integral electron energy spectrum and determine the neutrino mass with unparalleled accuracy. Right-handed couplings, which affect the shape of the electron energy spectrum near the endpoint, could possibly introduce a bias in the fitted neutrino mass, with errors ranging from 5-10% if the endpoint is used as a free parameter. However, if the endpoint is incorrectly used as a fixed input, the resulting error can be as large as 100%. Thus, the validity of experiments that assume fixed endpoints, and supposedly large right-handed coupling effects to the neutrino mass determination is extremely limited with regard to KATRIN."}

{"text":"\nThe present study investigates the likelihoods of angular displacement of double helical DNA through the evaluation of all-atom molecular data in comparison with the worm-like chain theory and the semi-elastic chain model. The research indicates that the worm-like chain model is applicable to double helices of one turn or longer and differs from the semi-elastic chain model. Results show only minor departures from expectations when dealing with shorter DNA structures, failing to explain recent atomic force microscope observations (Wiggins et al, Nature nanotechnology 1, 137 (2006)). It is possible that atomistic models of DNA might be missing certain mechanisms of DNA bending on intermediate scales. Further analysis has discovered that the motion of bending DNA may be anisotropic and heterogeneous on these intermediate scales, which might explain the discrepancies between the current evidence."}

We also consider a variant of the AF architecture termed project-and-forward (PF) which may exhibit more favorable power characteristics. In part two of this work, we will analyze the upper bounds of diversity in multi-hop channels while showing that they can be achieved with partitioning into AF subchannels."}
{"text":"\nThis paper explores the magnetic properties of U\/Fe, U\/Co, and U\/Gd multilayers using SQUID magnetometry and polarised neutron reflectivity measurements. Through a temperature-dependent study at 10K and a field range of -70kOe to 70kOe, a magnetic 'dead' layer of approximately 15Angstroms was observed in the U\/Fe and U\/Co systems. Further investigation of the U\/Gd multilayer revealed a significant reduction in the magnetic moment and Curie temperature when compared with the bulk metal, which can be attributed to pinning of the Gd moments due to the column-like growth process. Lastly, this study suggests that perpendicular magnetic anisotropy could occur in multilayers consisting of thick U and thin Gd layers."}
{"text":"\nThis paper presents a theoretical study of the impact of resonance scattering and magnetic fields on the degree and pattern of polarization in the Ba II D1 and D2 lines of the Fraunhofer spectrum -- at 4934 \\AA\\ and 4554 \\AA\\, respectively. A three-level atomic model of Ba II is used, and we take into account the hyperfine structure brought on by the $^{135}$Ba and $^{137}$Ba isotopes -- though their abundance is comparatively small (18%). Our approach utilizes an optically thin slab model, which permits us to investigate the impact of the major physical mechanisms (e.g. resonance polarization, Zeeman, Paschen-Back, and Hanle effects) in an orderly manner. We use the solar photospheric continuum radiation field to illuminate the slab from below, and study the scattered light at 90 degrees for both zero and arbitrary magnetic field strengths. Interestingly, our results point toward a differentially magnetically sensitive three-peak Q\/I profile that is found in the D2 line within the solar limb.

Through the combination of Ricci with mean curvature flow, the paper-clip and hair-pin models on the plane, scaling solutions associated to rational (p, q) closed curves, and the decay of two intersecting lines are identified as fixed points of this flow.

{"text":"\nIn this article, we develop a geometric approach to constructing exact solutions for gravity consisting of Einstein theory and its generalizations. Specifically, nonholonomic frame deformations are used to transform the gravitational field equations into sets of nonlinear partial differential equations which can be solved in general form. These solutions can be generically characterized by metrics depending on integration functions involving one, two, three, or four variables. Moreover, exact solutions with a parameter family may be obtained by source-free solutions of Einstein's equations with at least one Killing vector field. Additionally, a successive iteration procedure creates new classes of solutions specified by an infinite number of parameters with a non-Abelian group related to arbitrary functions of one variable. Finally, five classes of exact off-diagonal solutions are generated in vacuum Einstein and string gravity describing solitonic pp-wave interactions emerging from the primary Schwarzschild or pp-wave metrics. The potential physical implications of these solutions are also investigated."}
{"text":"\nThis paper presents a comprehensive full-sky model of polarized Galactic emission, based on three years of observations from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP). Building from maps of the Stokes Q and U components from each of the five frequency bands, this two-component model of the interstellar medium accounts for up to 97% of the polarized emission captured in the microwave sky by WMAP. Analysis has revealed that, at frequencies below 50 GHz, synchrotron emission is the primary source of the observed polarized foregrounds, equally affecting the intensity of the dust contribution at 65 GHz. The spectral index of the synchrotron component, derived exclusively from polarization data, is -3.2 overall, but varies slightly and is notably flatter along the Galactic plane. Polarization fraction of the synchrotron emission average at 2-4% within the Galactic plane, and peaks over 20% at high latitudes.

Additionally, the diffuse emission from high-latitude dust is also polarized at a mean fractional polarization of 0.036 +\/- 0.11."}
{"text":"This article explores weight structures, which are a new kind of triangulated category, focusing on the relationship between them and t-structures, and how these understandings can be applied to various categories including Voevodsky's categories of motives and spectra. These weight structures allow for the construction of towers of objects and canonically conservative weakly exact functors from a category $C$ to weak categories of complexes. A weight spectral sequence is also defined that generalizes the Deligne spectral sequence for classical realizations of motives and the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence for spectra. Further, some duality statements are presented between categories and $K$-groups. Lastly, the article examines cases in which a weight structure and an adjacent t-structure is formed, such as in Voevodsky's $DM^{eff}_-$ and the stable homotopy category.\n\nThis paper considers weight structures, a new notion of triangulated categories, in contrast to related $t$-structures. Through applications in Voevodsky's categories of motives and spectra, this article explores the nature of these weight structures, detailing how the construction of towers of objects and weight spectral sequences are made possible. Weakly exact functors are also defined, and duality is demonstrated between categories and $K$-groups. The examination of the relationship between a weight structure and an adjacent t-structure is discussed in Voevodsky's $DM^{eff}_-$ and the stable homotopy category."}
{"text":"\nThis research investigated the spectral features of HCOOH in astrophysically relevant ices. The ices were grown under high vacuum conditions, and the spectra were recorded in transmission using a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer. Spectra of pure HCOOH ices at 15 K and 145 K, binary mixtures of HCOOH:X and tertiary mixtures of HCOOH:H2O:X with X being CO, CO2, and CH3OH were studied. Results showed that the peak position, full width at half maximum, and band strength greatly depended on the ice structure, temperature, matrix components, and HCOOH concentration. Comparing the 5.9, 7.2, and 8.1 micron features of the solid HCOOH with astronomical data from two sources revealed that binary mixture spectra do not match the observed ice features. However, the tertiary mixtures especially with CH3OH matched the data from the sources. The results point to HCOOH being present in tertiary or more complex mixtures with H2O, CH3OH and potentially CO and CO2, implying constraints on HCOOH's formation."}
{"text":"\nWe examine an early K-type dwarf star, XO-2 (GSC 03413-00005), that is found to host an extrasolar planet, XO-2b, possessing a mass of 0.57+\/-0.06 Mjup and a radius of 0.98+0.03\/-0.01 Rjup, with an orbital period of 2.615857+\/-0.000005 days.

These components are almost identical in terms of spectrum, magnitude and stellar mass\/radius (Ms=0.98+\/-0.02 Msolar; Rs=0.97+0.02\/-0.01 Rsolar), and may have been thrown towards the Galactic Disk as a result of their eccentric orbit (Rper<4 kpc). Furthermore, XO-2 is regionally located to a Hercules dynamical stream, potentially tracing back its origin to the metal-rich, inner rim of the Thin Disk. We introduce a new Markov Chain Monte Carlo method in order to assess, via a transit light curve, the posterior probability of the parameters of this system."}
{"text":"\nThis research looks at how the rotation of an exoplanet may affect its transit spectrum. Specifically, the Doppler shift due to planetary rotation can be observed as an absorption feature that shifts during ingress and egress. We focus on the case of HD209458b, where the shift could reach up to 60 cm\/s on the corresponding stellar line. We perform simulations to analyze the impact of rotational velocity on the width and centroid of the spectral lines. Using this, we evaluate the signal-to-noise ratio of detecting a rotating planet compared to a non-rotating planet. For a 6 m telescope, it may be possible with a S\/N of 5 to measure a rotational velocity of 2 km\/s after several years of observation. With a 30 m telescope, detection of the same rotational velocity could take under two months of observation."}
{"text":"\nAn intense XMM-Newton research of the first unidentified, very high energy gamma-ray source (TeV J2032+4130) in the Cygnus region has recently been conducted. Upon examination, the observed X-ray emission from the source had notable point source contributions subtracted. An extensive evaluation of the deminimised emission employing results from blank sky and context-dependent regions of the XMM-Newton's field of view revealed a full width half maximum (FWHM) of approximately 12 arc minutes. Its centroid aligned with TeV J2032+4130's coordinates, and it's energy spectrum portrayed a power-law model with a photon index of 1.5 +\/- 0.2_stat +\/- 0.3_sys, along with an integrated 2 to 10 keV energy flux at an approximate value of 7*10^-13 ergs\/cm^2 s. This energy flux was significantly less than what had been observed in the gamma-ray flux from TeV J2032+4130. It has been assumed the extended X-ray emission presented is the counterpart of TeV J2032+4130, however it is possible it pertains to a related population of weak, hot (kT approximate 10 keV) unrevealed point sources that coincidentally aligns with the source and its extension. We evaluate these possible results in the frame of both hadronic and leptonic gamma-ray generation models."}

In addition, the paper offers analysis regarding spin models placed on networks, as well as self-organized criticality phenomena among interacting systems on networks.

{"text":"\nThis work provides a framework for analyzing the time-dependent entanglement entropy in generic quantum field theories. In line with the underlying covariant entropy bound behind the holographic principle, our proposal contains several covariant generalizations meant to evaluate the entanglement entropy associated with a certain boundary region. Specifically, we provide a construction which involves the area of a co-dimension two bulk surface with vanishing expansions of null geodesics, in accordance with the AdS\/CFT correspondence. Through examples, we illustrate how this covarientized version of the holographic entanglement entropy proposal works in static spacetimes, as well as in a collapsing black hole background. Additionally, we comment on the idea of considering Euclidean wormhole geometries with multiple boundaries as states induced by a set of non-interacting but entangled QFTs, each corresponding to one of the boundaries."}
{"text":"This paper presents a field-theoretic approach to study nonlinear perturbations on background solutions of both generic $D$-dimensional metric theories and general relativity. Perturbations are described by a Lagrangian, obtained from a variational principle, yielding field equations which can be used both in exact and approximate forms. Invariance under gauge transformations is maintained throughout, with particular attention to its exact and approximate representations. Importantly, conserved quantities (expressed as divergences of superpotentials) are constructed, elucidating the theoretical idea of perturbation conservation as a quasi-local nature in metric theories. The formalism is corroborated in general relativity and tested in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity."}
{"text":"\nWe measure the mass function of active black holes in the local Universe using data from the Fourth Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Our results show that the characteristic local active black hole has a mass of around 10^7 M_sun and is radiating at 10% of the Eddington rate. We find that the active fraction strongly depends on black hole mass, dropping more steeply than expected when the mass is both lower and higher than the characteristic mass. This deficit of massive radiating black holes is not a new observation, however this is the first measurement of a decline in the space density of active black holes at low mass. Our findings provide novel insights into the distribution of seed black holes in the early Universe."}

BPS equations are reduced to form a new integrable system similar to Liouville and Sine-Gordon theories, eventually becoming a linear equation which can be solved exactly. From this infinite class of solutions, a non-singular Janus solution is illuminated which is the AdS\/CFT dual of the maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills interface theory. Furthermore, further research towards a better understanding of the construction of globally non-singular solutions, such as $AdS_5 \\times S^5$ and supersymmetric Janus doped with D5 and\/or NS5 branes, is discussed in a companion paper."}
{"text":"\nThis paper presents an examination of exact Type IIB solutions on $AdS_4 \\times S^2 \\times S^2 \\times \\Sigma $ with 16 supersymmetries which were derived in a previous paper. By imposing topological and regularity conditions, an infinite class of such solutions is constructed with varying dilatons and 3-form fluxes. These solutions can be regarded as the fully back-reacted geometries of the $AdS_5 \\times S^5$ system (or its Janus generalization) augmented with D5 and\/or NS5 branes. The solutions are characterized by a hyper-elliptic Riemann surface $\\Sigma $ which is limited to having all its branch points situated on a line. Specific solutions for genus 0, that is Janus, have been recovered which have a total of 6 free parameters and their topology is the same as $AdS_5 \\times S^5$. Solutions for higher values of the genus have up to $4g+6$ free parameters, $2g-1$ of which are the real moduli of $\\Sigma$. These solutions have $2g+2$ asymptotic $AdS_5 \\times S^5$ regions, $g$ three-spheres with RR 3-form charge, and another $g$ three-spheres with NSNS 3-form charge. Collapse of consecutive branch points of $\\Sigma$ leads to singularities which are D5 and NS5 branes in a probe limit. It is proposed that the AdS\/CFT dual gauge theory for every solution consists of a 2+1-dimensional planar interface hosting $2g+2$ half-Minkowski 3+1-dimensional space-times with $\\mathcal{N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills theories, with coupled parameters indicating various operators on the interface, and potentially having different gauge couplings in the two $\\mathcal{N}=4$ theories."}
{"text":"\nRecent evidence suggests that a specific form of supernovae, referred to as hypernovae, are related to sub-energetic gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), such as SN1998bw\/GRB980425 and SN2003lw\/GRB031203. These hypernovae appear to involve mildly relativistic ejection of material, which could be linked with the sub-energetic GRBs. An analysis of the data from these events, assuming an energy distribution of ejected matter with $\\alpha \\sim 2$, suggests that the external shock front generated by a hypernova could energize protons up to $10^{19}$ eV. Furthermore, the rate of occurrence of hypernovae could potentially account for the energy flux beyond the second knee in the CR spectrum, and further, the steeper nature of this spectrum may be explained by this model. Additionally, hypernovae are likely to provide a diffuse ultrahigh-energy (UHE) neutrino flux as they interact with vicinity UV\/optical photons via $p\\gamma$ interactions."}
{"text":"\nThis paper investigates the feasibility of trans-relativistic supernovae as the source of cosmic rays from 10^15 to 10^18 eV. We find that these conditions are not met by ordinary supernovae, but trans-relativistic supernovae, which have been detected in association with high-energy gamma-ray bursts, are promising candidates. These energetic, high-velocity explosions can enable particle acceleration up to 10^18 eV and can produce the observed flux in this range, while not over-producing cosmic rays at lower energies. Taking into account the estimated rate and energy production of trans-relativistic supernovae, our analysis suggests that Galactic trans-relativistic supernovae could be responsible for the majority of cosmic rays with energies close to 10^18 eV."}
{"text":"\nUsing the Kerr-Schild coordinate system which does not have a coordinate singularity at the event horizon, the stationary hydrodynamic equations for transonic accretion disks and flows around rotating black holes are explored. Two types of causal viscosity prescriptions are looked at, and the appropriate boundary conditions are set at the sonic and viscous points, the latter in the case of one viscosity type. The formalism for transonic accretion disks is applied to obtain horizon-penetrating transonic solutions, which smoothly pass through the event horizon and are calculated for non-rotating and rotating black holes. These solutions describe ideal isothermal flows, ideal and viscous polytropic flows, as well as ADAFs with a relativistic equation of state, adiabatic accretion disks, standard accretion disks and supercritical accretion disks.  The flows are seen to have three velocities which are lower than the speed of light, even at the event horizon or inside of it. Additionally, the angular velocities of the accretion flows at the horizon differ from the angular velocity of the black hole's rotation due to frame-dragging. This result is different than those achieved by using the Boyer-Lindquist coordinate and its coordinate singularity at the horizon."}
{"text":"\nThis paper explores the variations of y-scaling in quasielastic electron scattering from nuclei consisting of $A=12$, 40, 56, 197, and 208 targets using a relativistic single particle model. Data from electron-nucleus cross-sections showing the predominance of quasielastic process is compared to the model and found to be a good representation. The study examines the kinematics through the four-momentum transfer, ranging from 0.20-0.80 (GeV\/c)$^2$, and looks into the Coulomb distortion of the electron and final state interactions' effects on the y-scaling, especially for the lower energy nucleons. Results found is a favorable efficiency of y-scaling, but lesser values of four-moment drivers shows a dependence on the electrons scattering angle. Modifications are applied to incorporate small binding energy variances basing on Z and A values, indicating a slight improvement in scaling."}
{"text":"\nFor the past 15 years, the Australia Telescope Compact Array has observed the aftermath of Supernova 1987A located in the Large Magellanic Cloud, by making high-resolution radio imaging of this spectacular core-collapse explosion. The initial expansion of the ejecta was exceptionally high and fast, but in 1990 the deceleration began due to dense circumstellar material expelled from the progenitor star, resulting in brightening radio synchrotron emission, discernable by the ATCA. We discuss that the remnant has been accelerating in its expansion, from about 3600 km\/s in 1992 to about 5200 km\/s by the end of 2006, the X-ray shell printed 15% smaller than the corresponding radio values, but a Fourier analysis of both reveals a diameter of 1.7 arcsec. An asymmetric brightness distribution occurred in the images at all ATCA epochs, where the eastern rim is brighter and further from the supernova site than the western lobe, indicating an uneven initial distribution of the supernova ejecta."}
{"text":"\nWe examine the Gross-Pitaevskii equation describing an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate confined in an optical lattice and driven by a spatiotemporal periodic laser field. By inducing a balance between the external time-dependent potential and the mean-field nonlinear interaction, exact Floquet states appear. Our analysis of the parameter balance region yields two distinct phases: one characterized by continuing patterns, and another by transition jumps. In the latter region, Floquet states appear as spatiotemporal vortices with nontrivial phase structures and zero-density cores. These are unstable periodic states embedded in chaos due to the singularity of vortex cores and the explosion of perturbed solutions. To verify the stability of these states, we study their fidelity through numerical time evolution. Results indicate that stable Floquet states can be prepared by slow growth of the external potential when applied to a uniformly initialized state."}
{"text":"\nThe present study explores the use of Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) to detect ultra-low levels of potassium contamination in an inorganic salt (CsI) and an organic liquid scintillator (LS).

The use of these techniques has improved the sensitivity and measurement of potassium contamination, with projected limits of $8 \\times 10^{-13}$ g\/g and $3 \\times10^{-17}$ g\/g for CsI and LS samples respectively. In addition, analysis of the LS samples revealed that the majority of the radioactive components came from the dye solutes present in the liquid scintillator, indicated by concentrations orders of magnitude higher than those in the base solvents. The results illustrate the effectiveness of AMS for measuring naturally-occurring isotopes."}

{"text":"\nBy examining observations of the baryonic mass density of the Universe, the Lyman-alpha forest cloud systems, and principles of primordial nucleosynthesis, this paper sets up boundary conditions for the Intergalactic Medium (IGM) at the epoch of z=2.5. Considering the Universe as a closed system and allowing it to expand adiabatically since the time when Quasi-Stellar Objects first ionized the IGM (5<=z_on<=20), the average kinetic energy of gas in the region transitioning to non-relativistic behavior is calculated. Combining all of these measurements, the thermal history of the IGM in the redshift range of 2.5<=z<=z_on is determined. This model also assumes that the hot IGM will inverse Compton scatter photons from the Cosmic Microwave Background, thus distorting it. When comparing this model to data from the Cosmic Background Explorer Satellite, there is a close agreement with the CMBR temperature. Unfortunately, this model does not explain the observed cosmic x-ray background. This paper has never been submitted for publication, and was originally written in 1990."}

{"text":"\nIn this study, we used the Simultaneous Differential Imager (SDI) feature on the VLT and the MMT to conduct an imaging survey of 45 young (<250 Myr) and close (<50 pc) stars to seek out the presence of any extrasolar planets. The data collected contained 54 objects, i.e. 45 close, young stars, 2 very young (<10 Myr) stars, 3 stars with known radial velocity planets, and 4 older, very nearby stars. The SDI devices use a double Wollaston prism and a quad filter to view images in 3 wavelength ranges around 1.62 um methane absorption found in the cool brown dwarfs and gas giant planets. This imaging survey results in H band contrasts > 10 mag (5 sigma) for 45% of the 45 close, young stars we observed, and > 9 mag for 80% of them when seen from 0.5''. This is one of the highest pixel attenuation ever recorded from ground or space for methane-rich companions < 1''. In the case of the 20 best survey stars, the 5 sigma completeness is calculated to be 50% for 6-10 M_Jup planets located 20-40 AU from the star. With this data, our survey null result allowed us to reject (with 98% confidence\/ 2.0sigma) a planet distribution model where N(a) $\\propto$ constant out to a distance of 45 AU."}
{"text":"\nThis article examines the question of why advanced electromagnetic potentials have typically been viewed as anomalous and forcibly omitted from classical Maxwell theory. We evaluate if this exclusion is necessary and, in some cases, potentially counter-productive. We then analyze direct-action theory wherein advanced and retracted contributions are equal; allowing us to explain observed symmetry breaks without relying on the Wheeler-Feynman mechanism. Moreover, we propose that cosmological redshift automatically satisfies the necessary boundary condition for the theory, thus uniting cosmological and thermodynamic arrows of time. Our research thus hints that advanced potentials may be ubiquitous after all."}
{"text":"  We explore the changes that occur to the gravitational wake, and ensuing dynamical friction, of a circular-orbiting perturber when moving through a uniform gaseous medium. This research follows-up on the findings of Ostriker (1999) who studied the motion of a perturber via a straight-line pathway. The dynamic effects of a circular orbit are considerable and manifest in the formation of a trailing tail, caused by the curved wake that is pushed through the gaseous medium. This asymmetry imparts angular forces in both directions of the perturber's motion and, although radial forces are not significant as far as orbital decay, there are still observable effects on the density wake. When experiencing subsonic motions, for example, the density wake takes on a curved shape, unique from Ostriker's findings, and the dynamical friction is nearly identical to that of a linear trajectory. Even more distinct, when the perturber surpasses the speed of sound, it has the potential to overtake the wake multiple times; consequentially forming a trailing spiral around the perturber, and consequently increasing the perturbed density both in the front and back of the perturber. We find a general agreement between the formulas for the drag forces as a function of the Mach number, as well as with Ostriker's model, when Vp t=2 Rp, where Vp and Rp refer to the velocity and orbital radius of the perturber, respectively."}

In addition, our invariants are able to detect torsion which is not visible through signature invariants, illustrating the presence of infinitely many torsion elements at any depth of the Cochran-Orr-Teichner filtration of link concordance."}

{"text":"\nWe examine if it is feasible to gain an understanding of the magnetic field intensity in inactive solar system regions via highly detailed polarimetric observations in the visible spectrum.

After downgrading the results to a resolution of 0\\farcs32, the simulated data is incorporated with noise.

{"text":"In light of recent outcomes from the MiniBooNE endeavor, we reexamine the worldwide neutrino oscillation fit of short-range neutrino information by including one or two sterile neutrinos with eV-scale masses to the three Standard Model neutrinos, and furthermore, consider the global fit with three sterile neutrinos for the first time. Prior to the currentMiniBooNE results, four-neutrino oscillations of the (3+1) type had just been slightly approved, and become much less desirable with the new data (at a 4-sigma level). In the setting of so-called (3+2) five-neutrino mass models we observe an extreme discrepancy between perceived and vanishing trials at a sum of 3-sigma or better, correspondingly, no satisfactory fit to the total information can be accomplished in (3+2) frames. This pressure stays unaltered when a third sterile neutrino is incorporated and the nature of the overall fit does not noticeable improve in a(3+3) plan. In any case, it should be noticed that in models with in excess of one sterile neutrino the MiniBooNE outcomes coordinate perfectly with the LSND appearance proof, because of the presence of CP violation accessible in such oscillation plans. Moreover, if vanishing information isn't thought about,(3+2) oscillations give a superb fit to the complete MiniBooNE range including the occasion abundance at low energies."}

{"text":"\nThis thesis investigates the environment of the Galactic center (GC) in order to better understand the unique processes present in this region. To this effect, an array of observation techniques are employed, such as single-dish and interferometric radio continuum, radio recombination line, polarized radio continuum, and mid-IR observations. These observations span physical scales of 0.1 to 100 parsecs and have resulted in one of the most sensitive studies of the radio continuum emission in the central 500 parsecs. Nonthermal radio filaments are also studied in order to provide insight into their origin and the structure of the magnetic field in the GC region. Moreover, I focus on the Galactic center lobe (GCL), a 150-pc-tall shell-like structure, and analyze the spectral index, dust emission, polarized continuum emission, and ionized gas throughout the GCL. Based on this analyses, strong evidence is found in support of the idea that the GCL is a true three-dimensional shell located in the GC region. Furthermore, an examination of the physical conditions of the GCL reveals that starburst outflows appear to be the most likely explanation for its origin, although other theories cannot be ruled out due to the observed pressure and star formation rate in the central tens of parsecs of our Galaxy."}
{"text":"\nIn this paper, we discuss the building of a dynamical formulation for computing coefficients in the electroweak chiral Lagrangian, which bases on the first-principles of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). We draw out the coefficients of the chiral Lagrangian for pseudo-scalar mesons from a one-doublet technicolor model and a schematic topcolor-assisted technicolor on. Further inspection reveals that the calculable coefficients are divided into three segments: direct TC2 interaction, induced Z' particle-contributed parts from TC1 and TC2, and ordinary quark responses. Both the direct TC2 interaction and the Z' particle-induced contributions are calculated for the purposes of this paper, and the result demonstrates that the DIRECT TC2 interaction is akin to that of the one-doublet technicolor model. Additionally, the effecive Z' particle's contribution appears at least as a proportional parameter to the p^2 order lagrangian, accompanied by the condition that only bears positive values for the T and U factors. The variable T again varies in the range of 0 to 1\/25alpha and its upper boundary goes down as the Z' mass grows larger. The S parameters can either be positive or negative, dependent on the Z' mass size. It can further be seen that the Z' mass is limited to an upper boundary, which itself is determined by the T parameter value. Finally, the coefficients of the electroweak chiral lagrangian up to the order of p^4 are obtained and listed."}
{"text":"This paper provides a method to invert the spectral problem for rational Lax matrices of size R+1, based on the curve of the associated characteristic polynomial and additional data. We make use of twisted Cauchy-like kernels to formulate an integral residue formula to represent the entries of Lax matrices, with all components being expressed in terms of Theta functions. Different elements in the matrix are realized with the aid of 'elementary twists', leading to the construction of sequences of Lax matrices that have the same spectral curve and polar structure, but related by rational conjugations. Our formulae are further used to derive certain finite-band recurrence relations, which are satisfied by various types of orthogonal and biorthogonal polynomials. Such models are relevant to the study of the leading-order behavior of these polynomials at large degree."}
{"text":"\nWe present a novel and highly efficient technique for capturing the thermal and radiative effects in the energy equation of SPH simulations of star formation. This approach is based on the individual particle's density, temperature and gravitational potential, which are used to calculate an average optical depth. This value is then employed to regulate the heat and cooling of a particle. Our algorithm takes into account multiple processes, including the rotational and vibrational states of H2, the opacity brought by melting ice mantles, dust sublimation, molecular lines, H-, bound-free and free-free processes as well as electron scattering, external radiation and thermal inertia. The computational cost is compatible to a standard SPH simulation using a barotropic equation of state, rendering it easy to implement in particle- and grid-based codes. The algorithm exhibits excellent results and can simulate optical depths in the range 0 < tau < 10^11."}
{"text":"\nThis study focuses on the angular distributions of electrons emitted following the two-photon ionization of hydrogen-like ions via second order perturbation theory and the Dirac equation. We employ a density matrix approach in order to analyze the impact that the polarization of the entering light and higher multipoles in the expansion of the electron--photon interaction have on the angular distribution. Results indicate that, in comparison to the electric-dipole approximation, the non-dipole contributions lead to a large change in the angular distribution of the emitted electrons, particularly for the ionization of medium- to high-Z ions like H, Xe$^{53+}$, and U$^{91+}$. This includes a prominent forward emission, which would not be present in a dipole approximation where the electron emission is always symmetric to the plane perpendicular to the photon beam. We present detailed results on the dependence of the photoelectron angular distributions on the polarization of the incident light."}
{"text":"I propose the establishment of an Alternative History astro-ph archive (AltHistastro-ph). This repository would serve as a safe space for astronomers to store rejected telescope proposals, providing catharsis for the authors and pleasure for the readers of the posts. Additionally, this archive could provide a valuable setting for connecting astronomers with promising yet unappreciated ideas with those that have yet-to-be-utilized resources, potentially leading to the resurrection of the old proposals and its eventual publication in the regular astro-ph archive. Such an archive could offer a soaring signal-to-noise ratio, though this could be potentially confusing. Therefore, I suggest the creation of this separate archive in order to maintain the integrity of the main astro-ph archive. To bolster my suggestion, I have included an example of an AltHistAstro-ph posting - a rejected HST proposal of my own."}
{"text":"\nAnalysis of Cassini UVIS stellar and solar occultations on Titan have revealed the presence of 12 different chemical species in its meso- and thermosphere, including nitrogen, methane, acetylene, ethylene, ethane, diacetylene, benzene, dicyanodiacetylene, cyanoacetylene and hydrogen cyanide. In addition, these measurements have also detected the presence of aerosol particles, with a refractive index equivalent to that of tholin. Through Mie Theory, we were able to establish that these aerosol particles have a radius of $\\sim$125 \\AA, and the derived vertical profile shows unique features which could indicate a reactive generation process going beyond 1000 km above the surface. Our photochemical model was used as a basis to examine the chemistry, physics and opacity of Titan's atmosphere, and we concluded that the simplest molecule condensable in Titan's atmosphere is dicyanodiacetylene and located at 650 km, where the temperature is at its lowest. More observations are required to verify the condensation, production and existence of dicyanodiacetylene."}
{"text":"\nThis paper presents the results of a mid-infrared laser light nulling experiment using single-mode conductive waveguides. A Michelson interferometer with a co-axial beam-combination scheme at 10.6 microns was used with a Pi phase shift introduced using a mirror. Dynamic and static measurements of the nulling ratio were made with and without the effect of modal filtering. An average statistical nulling ratio of 2.5e-4 was recorded, with a 1-sigma upper limit of 6e-4 and a best null of 5.6e-5 in static mode being achieved. Despite the positive effect of the SM conductive waveguide on modal filtering being noted, external vibrations limited the ability to maintain the null to 10 to 20 seconds. Proper mechanical isolation of the setup is recommended for further improvement."}
{"text":"\nThis article examines the black hole information paradox, which suggests that information about a collapsing body can be destroyed due to a process by which the object becomes a black hole and then emits Hawking radiation. We explore how this paradox may be a consequence of inconsistencies in the semiclassical theory of black hole evolution, and propose possible solutions to the issue of localization. These include the introduction of a G\\\"odel-like incompleteness to impose consistency, and modifying the theory to avoid self-reference. We assess various scenarios, such as eternally collapsing objects and black hole remnants, to aid in implementing these solutions, along with variants of semiclassical quantum gravity."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate interstellar extinction curves towards 328 stars of the Galactic B and late-O spectra by applying a novel method involving stellar atmosphere models instead of the standard unreddened stars. Our technique ascertains the precision of the curves, performs a scientific assessment of the errors and supports a thorough testing of the relationship between different curve parameters. Our conclusions are the following: (1) It has been found again that the central place of the extinction bump at 2175 A is moderately variable, its width is highly variable and these two changes are not associated. (2) Correlations have been established among some extinction properties in both the UV and IR regions. (3) A few curves with wide R(V) values excluded, there is no connection between UV and IR portions of the Galactic extinction curves. (4) The huge variance from one sightline to another infers that any average Galactic extinction curve will always demonstrate the biases of its original sample. (5) Using an average curve to deredden a spectral energy distribution can cause significant errors, hence the realistic error budget for the dereddened SED must factor in the observed variance of Galactic curves. These results show that extinction curves are responsive to local situations, each curve having its own distinctive information regarding the grains along its sightline."}
{"text":"\nAstronomers have used the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RossiXTE) to identify three types of X-ray oscillations coming from disk-accreting neutron stars with weak magnetic fields. These oscillations are believed to be powered by the release of gravitational energy from matter which falls into the star's particularly powerful gravitational field; this matter may also ignite nuclear fusion, thereby generating high frequency fluctuations. Such oscillations can be used to probe fundamental physical principles, such as those related to strong-field gravity and matter under extreme conditions, as well as advance our understanding of the formation, growth and evolution of millisecond pulsars. Investigations using RossiXTE has thus far indicated a preponderance of neutron stars in low-mass X-ray binary systems with spin rates below 600 Hz; this appears to be caused by a combination of magnetic braking and the potential limitation of matter accretion. Through further examination, it is possible to assess the influence of gravitational radiative braking influences. Analysis of the kilohertz oscillations has yielded support for the existence of the innermost stable circular orbits predicted by strong-field general relativity and more accurately narrowed the models of ultra-dense matter."}
{"text":"\n\nWe investigate the emission and absorption of noise in a fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) system at various temperatures. To do this, we model the edges of the FQHE as chiral Luttinger liquids and make use of the Keldysh perturbative non-equilibrium formalism. We find the non-symmetrized high frequency noise contains strong hints of the electron-electron interactions; this phenomenon can be employed to not only verify the Luttinger liquid physics in FQHE edge states, but also other one-dimensional systems like carbon nanotubes. Notably, the emission and absorption components of the excess noise (defined as the difference between the noise at both zero and finite voltage) in an interacting system are distinct from the non-interacting case, where they are identical. We scrutinize the resonance features that show up in the noise because of the Josephson frequency (proportional to the applied voltage) and also analyze the effects of the distance between the measurement point and the backscattering site. We primarily study the weak backscattering limit, however we also look into the high-frequency noise in the tunneling regime."}
{"text":"This paper explores the use of thermal noise and its artificial versions (Johnson-like noises) for totally secure communication via a wire. Three topics are discussed: zero power communication, thermal noise driven computing, and secure classical communication. Special attention is given to the third topic, emphasizing the unique properties of thermal noise and its utilization in a simple Kirchhoff's loop. The proposed communicator allows for secure key sharing and network-ready communication over current power or phone lines, with ranges and signal fidelity beyond the reaches of any known direct quantum communication channel. Test results on a model line show communication rates of up to 100 bit\/second and an astonishingly small 0.02% raw-bit error rate."}
{"text":"\nIn this paper, we explore the validity of using cluster counts and cosmic shear power spectra together to probe the nature of dark energy. We employ a halo model approach to examine the cross-covariance between the two observables from the underlying matter density field. Our analysis reveals a notable correlation between the multipoles of the lensing power spectrum and the cluster counts of high mass halos (M>10^14Msun). Taking the full covariance into account has the potential to either degrade or improve the total signal-to-noise ratios by up to 20%. We additionally consider the effects of incorporating the cross-covariance on cosmological parameter estimations and find that it can be roughly considered independent in a multi-dimensional parameter space. Lastly,Lens-selected clusters with a realistic-realistic threshold may reduce the uncertainty of each dark energy parameters approximately by half."}
{"text":"\nWe use parameter division to analyze existing cosmological datasets to explore if dark energy models are successful in explaining current observations. We derive a single parameter for each model that regulates geometry, and another that regulates the growth of structures found in astrophysical data. By doing this, we are able to extensively test the consistency of each model from the Type Ia Supernovae, Cosmic Microwave Background, galaxy clustering and weak gravitational lensing statistics datasets. Our results suggest that the cosmological constant model is in line with available data, while modified gravity theories that deviate from General Relativity are more likely to be compromised. For instance, the best fitting flat Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (DGP) model as approximated by the technique used in our study falls outside the 3 Sigma contour when compared to all datasets."}
{"text":"\nThe gravitational lensing effect of intervening spots of mass can be discerned by observing the alignment of far-flung galaxies. However, this cosmic shear signal may be contaminated by the alignment of the galaxies themselves, which needs to be factored out in order to place certain constrictions on our cosmology. We discuss two models in this area and investigate the impact of intrinsic alignments on the number of necessary tomographic redshift bins and the robustness of dark energy constraints. With the inclusion of intrinsic alignments, dark energy biases can reach as high as 50 percent. Furthermore, we find that unless the photometric redshift uncertainty is increased by a factor of three, the dark energy figure of merit will decline. Lastly, we analyze how prior knowledge of the intrinsic alignment model may improve the accuracy of the final result."}
{"text":"\nThis research examines the properties of binary microlensing light curves. While caustic crossing light curves have been widely identified, there are also many morphologies that deviate from the point lens form. Significant asymmetry, multiple peaks, and repeating events are examples of these diverse binaries. Computer simulations have provided insight into the ratio of caustic and non-caustic crossing events for a microlensing survey This study also assesses possible sources for the prevalence of caustic events, such as blending, sampling rate, and the binary population."}
{"text":"\nThis paper presents an approach to the study of two-dimensional topological insulators, with an example of a model graphene Hamiltonian from Kane and Mele, using a nonperturbative definition that involves boundary phase twists that couple only to charge, and can be measured by pumping cycles of ordinary charge. This method of determination is distinct from previous efforts in that it does not refer to edge states. Furthermore, the phase of a Slater determinant of electronic states is determined by a Chern parity analogous to Chern number in the integer quantum Hall effect case. Results are found to agree with network model studies - that the direct transition between ordinary and topological insulators that occurs in band structures is a consequence of the perfect crystalline lattice, with a metallic phase separating the two phases in two dimensions when spin-orbit coupling is present. This technique can also be applied to study three-dimensional topological insulators."}
{"text":"\nIt is possible for two independent, dual, and indistinguishable particles to undergo interference under certain circumstances. This interference is due to the quantum exchange statistics, and is observed when the combined probability of detecting the particles in two distinct detectors is measured. We present the first case in which two non-interacting electrons have shown interference in an interferometer proposed by Yurke et al. and Samuelsson et al. Comparable to the classical waves observed in the \"Hanbury Brown and Twiss\" (HBT) experiment, two mutually incoherent electron beams have been split into four trajectories, containing an Aharonov-Bohm (AB) flux. As expected, the individual currents were unaffected by the flux, however, the cross-correlation between the current fluctuations in two opposing points of the device displayed prominent AB oscillations. This indicates a two-particle entanglement despite the lack of interaction between the electrons."}
{"text":"This paper introduces a model to study the thermal evolution of metal-poor gas through a simplified chemical and thermal approach. This model takes into consideration a limited molecular chemistry of the heavy elements, namely the formation and destruction of molecular hydrogen. We are able to accurately capture the thermal evolution of the gas for varied temperatures (50-10,000 K) and metallicities (0-0.1 solar masses) in an expansive volume. Additionally, for the lowest metallicities or greatest ultraviolet radiation fields, the model can be used in densities as large as 500 per characteristic timescale (in Myr) per cm3. We provide some potential applications for the model."}
{"text":"\nThis paper examines the role of normalizers in irreducible inclusions of II$_1$ factors $N\\subseteq M$. In light of the infinite index setting, the focus is on one-sided normalizers and their connection to projections in the basic construction. It is established that any trace one projection in the relative commutant of $N$ and $M$ can be represented as a unitary in $M$ with $uNu^*\\subseteq N$. The identification of normalizers as well as the algebras they generate is then discussed in certain settings. In particular, the normalizers of tensor products of irreducible subfactors are shown to correspond to a tensor product of normalizers modulo a unitary. The paper also looks at irreducible subfactors arising from subgroup-group inclusion and reveals the normalizers in this case to be elements of the normalizing group modulo a unitary. Furthermore, the bimodules in $\\ell^2(G)$ with a finite trace are proved to be double cosets which are just finite unions of left cosets."}
{"text":"\nThis study examined the correlation of the temperature-dependent shape anisotropy with the coercivity (HC(T)) of the Stoner-Wohlfarth (SW) soft ferromagnetic materials such as fcc Ni, fcc Co and bcc Fe by means of Neel-Brown (N-B) analysis. The extended N-B equation was used to account for the temperature-dependent shape anisotropy by introducing a single dimensionless correction function,the reduced magnetization m(\\tao). The factors, such as the switching field at zero temperature (H0), and the potential barrier at zero field (E0) were also taken into consideration. The expression for the blocking temperature, TB = E0m^2(\\tao) \/ [kBln(t\/t0)], was derived with the inclusion of an additional correction factor m^2(\\tao). The issue of the impact of the downshift of the Curie temperature TC caused by the finite size effect on HC(T) and TB was also discussed."}
{"text":"\nThis paper presents a study of a rotationally driven system of many-body bosons in a harmonic trap. The calculation was accomplished using the 3D-Cranked Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HF-B) method, which is an extended variational approach that incorporates pairing correlations. Unlike the original Gross-Pitaevskii theory, this method can incorporate finite-range interactions between particles. As an example, a system of ten bosons interacting with a repulsive quadrupole-quadrupole force was used to demonstrate the validity of our method. The results showed that the yrast states, or lowest-energy states for a given total angular momentum, do not generally form a Bose-Einstein condensate, but rather a vortex state when the total angular momentum ($L$) is twice the particle number ($N$), i.e. $L=2N$."}
{"text":"\nThis study investigates the ability of a neutral genetic drift to shape the function of proteins beyond their primary biological role. We analyze how cytochrome P450 enzymes evolved neutrally with respect to one substrate react to five others. Our results indicate that these proteins can experience as much as four-fold change in their promiscuous activities over a number of mutations. Further, these activities tend to be associated with the chemical structure of the substrates, with coordinated changes in activities observed when confronted with chemically similar substrates. Our findings suggest that neutral genetic drift can contribute to significantly altered protein functions; the newly obtained changes could be leveraged in the evolution of new functions if required by future selection."}
{"text":" \nThis article presents a method for distinguishing clusters in a bulk phase that share the same topological features as reference clusters. We have selected 13 atoms as the maximum size among the Morse clusters, as well as 13 atom clusters found in FCC and HCP crystal structures, comprising one atom and its 12 nearest neighbours. The bond network in the bulk phase must be identified initially, and this can be accomplished by determining inter-atomic distances or by utilizing a distinct version of Voronoi decomposition. Through this process, 3, 4 and 5-membered shortest path rings are identified in order to form basic clusters. These basic clusters are then combined in order to recognize the Morse and crystal clusters, and larger Morse clusters (more than 13 atoms) can be identified through both the basic clusters and the smaller Morse clusters. This study has implications for understanding the energy landscape in a bulk phase, and limited preliminary results from the hard sphere fluid phase are discussed."}
{"text":"\nThis article examines the possibility of using image processing for spatial indexing two dimensional data. It takes advantage of visual analogies from machine and human vision to construct a grid based indexing system. The proposed method applies bins to the data and subdivides them based on the number of data records. The advantage of this technique is that the search space can be divided into non-rectangular regions that correspond to the data's spatial properties. To test the reliability of this method the bucketing quad tree is compared to the quad tree. With higher resolution images the algorithm proves to be more effective. Further a specific class structure is developed which allows the application of particular spatial indexes while rendering the data as an image."}
{"text":"We investigate the spin relaxation of electrons in (001) GaAs quantum wells, both intrinsic and $p$-type,\nby numerically solving the kinetic spin Bloch equations with all the relevant scatterings accounted for.\nIn particular, the electron-heavy hole exchange scattering, which leads to the Bir-Aronov-Pikus\nspin relaxation, is explicitly included. Our calculations indicate that, if we limit our analyses to the\nFermi-golden-rule approach and neglect the nonlinear terms, the spin relaxation due to the Bir-Aronov-Pikus mechanism\nwill be greatly overestimated at moderate electron density and low temperature.\nWe also study the spin relaxation time due to the D'yakonov-Perel' mechanism and compare it with\nthe one arising from the Bir-Aronov-Pikus mechanism. Our results demonstrate that in intrinsic quantum wells,\nthe effect of the Bir-Aronov-Pikus mechanism is much smaller than that of the D'yakonov-Perel' mechanism\nat low temperature and is no more than one order of magnitude higher at high temperature.\nIn $p$-type quantum wells, the spin relaxation due to Bir-Aronov-Pikus mechanism is much lower than\nthat of the D'yakonov-Perel' mechanism at low temperature, but can become comparable when\nthe hole density and quantum well width are big enough. Thus, contrary to the situation in bulk samples,\nthe Bir-Aronov-Pikus mechanism is not expected to generally dominate the spin relaxation of two-dimensional systems."}
{"text":"\nThis paper examines the multifractal properties of the local order parameter $\\rho(r)$ at critical random points. To this end, we consider the moments $\\bar{\\rho^q(r)}$ of the parameter, which typically follow a scaling behaviour distinct from that of $qx(1)$, as initially conjectured by Ludwig in the context of the two-dimensional Potts model. We then proceed to incorporate recent findings related to generalized moments $Y_q$, noting that they tend to be characterised by different finite dimensions $D(q)$ and $\\tilde{D}(q)$. Finally, our focus shifts to critical random polymer systems, which are studied numerically for specific cases. We hypothesise that large, Griffiths-ordered clusters at criticality determine the minimum value $\\alpha_{min} = D(q \\rightarrow \\infty) = d-x(1)$ of the multifractal spectrum."}
{"text":"This investigation reveals the source and nature of thermal ion evaporation out of\na multipole ion trap. Results indicate that the evaporation rate is connected to\na Boltzmann factor, with an activation energy as an adjustable trap parameter.\nA dependence of the effective trap volume on the amplitude of the applied rf trapping\nfield and an analytical parametersation of the trap depth are also outlined, thus\naiding in determining the most favorable trapping conditions."}
{"text":"\nThis research analyzes how simple signaling systems can be used to assemble structures made up of single cells, akin to modern multicellular organisms. By using a combination of cellular automata models and coupled differential equations in 2D, as well as Lennard-Jones-like particles in 3D, the self-assembly process can be simulated with startling results. It is found that with even basic inter-cell signaling, colonies can form robust structures such as towers, balls atop stalks, and even fast-moving slugs. The similarity to the behavior of modern Dictyostelium slime molds, which use cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), is quite apparent. This study demonstrates that, even with minimal signaling, multicellular organisms can be simulated and assembled."}
{"text":"\nThis paper provides a comparison of two different ways to understand cosmological density perturbations in Palatini modified gravity. The first involves a generalization of Birkhoff's theorem and the second is through a linearization of the gravitational field equations. The findings are used to determine a general form for the gravitational lagrangian that produces the same results for the long wave limit. Additionally, the perturbation evolution for a certain type of lagrangian (with parameters b and c) is calculated, with results that match up to the observational data. It is also noted that these results don't hold up for models deviating greatly from the standard concordance model and on increasingly smaller scales."}
{"text":"\nBy analyzing the Suzaku observations of the powerful radio-loud quasar RBS315 (z=2.69) up to energies of 50 keV, we detect an X-ray continuum with a power-law slope of Gamma=1.5 above 1 keV and a strong deficit of soft photons. We investigate two options to explain this low-energy cut-off: intrinsic absorption by gas with a column density of N_H~10^22 cm^{-2} in the quasar's rest frame, or a break in the continuum with a Gamma of 0.7 below 1 keV. After obtaining quasi-simultaneous UVOT\/SWIFT optical-UV measurements to construct the source's Spectral Energy Distribution, similar to those of other Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars, we modeled the SED with the typical synchrotron-Inverse Compton model used for FSRQs. This interpretation leads us to consider that in some high redshift radio-loud quasars, the cut-off in the soft X-ray band could be due to a natural curvature of the spectrum near the low energy end of the IC component rather than to intrinsic absorption. Further research is necessary to settle this question conclusively."}
{"text":"\nIn this study, we analyze spin-polarized transport in II-VI magnetic resonant tunneling devices. Experimental and theoretical models are used to assess the impact of the exchange interaction between conduction electrons and impurities on the current-voltage characteristics for cases in which a magnetic field is applied. We observe two peaks in the current-voltage characteristics corresponding to transport via each spin channel. As the external field is further increased, we observe an increase in peak amplitude, shift of the resonance to higher voltages, and spin polarisation of the injected current. Our model demonstrates that these results arise from a combination of giant Zeeman splitting, 3-D incident distribution and broad resonance linewidth."}
{"text":"\nThis Letter examines the lightcurve of the latest X-ray flare detected from the supermassive black hole Sagittarius A*, which was notable for its distinctive structure. We suggest that this phenomenon is due to a Rossby wave instability in the disk which creates Enhanced accretion, and use ray tracing calculations based on a Schwarzschild metric to determine how general relativistic effects would affect this process. Our simulations of this disk have found a spiral pattern, which when compared to the X-ray data, suggests an inclination angle of 77 deg. This result provides evidence that the flares are generated in Sgr A*'s inner disk, with the observed period likely occurring due to the pattern speed, rather than the Keplerian motion beneath it."}
{"text":"\nIn this article, we use the Counting Test Facility - a 4 ton spherical scintillation detector immersed in 1000 tons of water for shielding - as a platform to extend pulse shape discrimination (PSD) studies from small samples to large-volume setups. We apply two different liquid scintillation mixtures in this setting and analyze the results either through Gatti's method for PSD based on the waveform processing or through a more conventional approach that is based on the charge content of the scintillation tail. These outcomes will enable a better understanding of the performance of the Borexino detector, as reliable PSD is essential for background reduction and achieving the expected sensitivity for detecting solar neutrino signals."}
{"text":"This article investigates the relationship between the scalar wave equation and a modified Schwarzschild space-time in a non-commutative geometry. Solutions to the equation are analyzed near spatial infinity, and the investigation concludes that if theta is finite, then the field's asymptotic behavior is reduced in class due to the conformal singularity at spacelike infinity, resulting in a slower fall-off than what is seen in flat space-time."}
{"text":"\nThis paper investigates the effect of initial mixedness on the decoherence of a macroscopic quantum superposition (MQS). It establishes that in comparison to a pure MQS with the same size of the central distance between its component states, a highly mixed MQS undergoing decoherence may experience a quicker dissipative process at first, yet this rate can then be significantly reduced after a certain period, becoming slower than its corresponding pure MQS. Our findings, which have practical implications for experiments aiming to generate MQSs, suggest that an MQS with a large degree of noise added to its initial state can still exhibit non- classical properties in a moderately-sized timespan."}
{"text":"This study presents a Monte Carlo Model for Heavy-ion Therapy (MCHIT) and its validation with experimental data for monoenergetic carbon-ion beams in water and PMMA phantoms. We evaluated the model's performance for predicting (1) depth-dose distributions in water and PMMA, (2) doses for fragments of certain charge, (3) distributions of positron-emitting nuclear fragments, (4) energy spectra of secondary neutrons, and (5) radial dose profiles for primary nuclei and different projectile fragments. Results show that significant contributions to the total dose occur from secondary nuclear fragments at the Bragg peak."}
{"text":"\nBy means of the matrix product formalism, we find exact ground state solutions of a class of continuous one-dimensional quantum spin chains comprising of nearest and next-nearest neighbour anti-ferromagnetic interaction, featuring 5 parameters. Our model is related to the well-known Majumdar-Ghosh model, which similarly features two-fold degenerate ground states. Along with non-zero staggered magnetizations, these states also possess entangled structures on adjacent sites. Upon combining their translation-invariant counterparts, the magnetization vanishes. Further, we also obtain closed-form expressions for the two-point correlation functions for finite-sized chains and for the thermodynamic limit."}
{"text":"  The RIXS process has been shown to be an effective technique for probing transversal spin dynamics of La$_2$CuO$_4$. To that end, a theoretical expansion of the relevant RIXS magnetic cross-section was presented using an Ultrashort Core-Hole Lifetime (UCL) approximation. This expansion was built upon a linear spin-wave model of the Heisenberg spin system, which includes longer range and cyclic spin interactions. It was observed that strengthening of the antiferromagnetic order increases the first moment of the spectrum. Data from experiments matched up very well with the theoretical spectra and it was indicated that the observed low-temperature RIXS intensity was due to two-magnon scattering, with a single-magnon scattering contribution at finite temperature that is proportional to $T^3$. Additionally, corrections to the UCL approximation were found to be small, thereby making the UCL results more reliable."}
{"text":"\nIn this article, we examine the efficacy of the least angle regression and forward stagewise algorithms for the purpose of solving penalized least squares regression problems. We draw upon a study conducted in 2004 by Efron, Hastie, Johnstone & Tibshirani which demonstrated that the least angle regression algorithm, with a minor modification, was able to solve lasso regression problems. We provide an analogous study for incremental forward stagewise regression, displaying that it successfully solves a lasso problem which enforces monotonicity. This opens up a new avenue of exploration: while lasso prioritises optimisation of the residual sum-of-squares in a one way relationship with the $L_1$-norm of the coefficient $\\beta$, forward stagewise is more efficient in terms of optimising the $L_1$ arc-length traveled along the coefficient path. We also analyse a condition which dictates when the coefficient paths of the lasso are monotone, which may lead the two methods converging in some cases. To conclude, we contrast lasso and forward stagewise procedures in a data simulation comprising of multiple correlated predictors."}
{"text":"\nWe present a novel cooling methodology for a Fermi gas consisting of three distinct components. One pair of components are allowed to interact, creating a paired state, while the third component remains in the normal state. An external electromagentic field is used to couple together components two and three, which causes cooling of the normal state even when it has a higher temperature initially. The efficiency of this process is determined by the pairing energy and the linewidth of the coupling field. In comparison to conventional solid state junction methods, this cooling process is governed by momentum conservation, and the role of energy-relaxing processes that exist in tunneling are replaced by the linewidth. Additionally, the process is compatible with RF-spectroscopy methods which are already applied in current studies of ultracold gases."}
{"text":"\nIn this study, we perform a near infrared spectroscopic search for the close orbiting extrasolar giant planet HD 75289b. To do so, we use the Phoenix spectrograph at Gemini South to take ~230 spectra in the 2.18 - 2.19 micron wavelength. We compare the combined star and planet light to the direct spectrum of an irradiated model atmosphere in search of an absorption profile signature. We also adapt phase dependent orbital models and tomographic techniques to seek out the detection of absorption signatures. With the multiline deconvolution technique, we increase the signal-to-noise ratio of the data, though no planet signature is observed. Simulations suggest that widening the wavelength coverage can enable the detection of a planet such as HD 75289b with a 4 sigma confidence. In addition, we examine the sensitivity of our method, estimating detection assumptions under mismatched observed and modeled planetary atmospheres."}
{"text":"\nIn this study, a 30'x30' area was examined in and around the merging cluster A2744 at redshift ~0.3 which was conducted using low resolution multiple object spectroscopy and BVR photometry. This analysis aimed to uncover substructures, detect galaxies at the same photometric redshift as the cluster, and study the relation between substructure and properties of the galaxy population. The Dressler-Schectman analysis and photometric redshift technique were applied in this research and two large-scale filaments were discovered associated with A2744. It was found that the ratio of blue to red galaxies increased with the cluster-centric radius and displayed a peak beyond the cluster\u2019s virial radius. Furthermore, those two filaments were host to several bright, large blue galaxies which are not commonly seen among galaxies in lower density environments at the same redshift as the cluster. It is believed that these findings may be explained by the phenomenon of 'galaxy harassment."}
{"text":"\nWe explore a new approach to address inverse problems by developing a technique that combines the SVD inversion with an automated thresholding procedure within a specialized basis. This new approach, referred to as needlets, allows us to enjoy the advantages of localized multiscale analysis akin to wavelets while retaining the stability of SVD decomposition. In particular, our goal is to implement an efficient estimation procedure that uses needlet constructions over the SVD basis. To illustrate the effectiveness of this approach, we analyze two problems; that of deconvolution and Wicksell. In the latter, our method implies the existence of optimal rates of convergence in the $L_2$ case and also provides for new rates of convergence for $L_p$ norms that have not previously been reported in the literature. Simulation studies further demonstrate that our NEED-D estimator outperforms other traditional algorithms across various settings."}
{"text":"\nAdvanced LIGO, the upcoming ground-based gravitational-wave detector, is able\nto potentially detect intermediate mass ratio inspirals (IMRIs). These events\nare expected to occur when a neutron star (NS) or black hole (BH) orbits an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH). We study four possible formation mechanisms and show that during inspiral the eccentricities of IMRIs will likely largely circularize. We then estimate the coalescence rate of IMRIs in globular clusters and the sensitivity of a network of three Advanced LIGO detectors to detect them. We conclude that, while tens of IMRIs per year may be detectable, rates of one to a few per year may be more plausible. We also find that loss of signal-to-noise ratio due to using circular IMRI templates for data analysis is negligible."}
{"text":"\nThe Wide Field Spectrograph (WiFeS) is an integral field, double-beam, concentric, image-slicing spectrograph that is currently being built as part of the Australian National University's (ANU) 2.3m telescope located at the Siding Spring Observatory. It is designed to provide high throughput, wavelength accuracy, and spectrophotometric performance, in addition to a wide spectral coverage in the 320-950 nm range, along with excellent image quality. It features a 25x38 arcsec field with 0.5 arcsec sampling in twenty-five 38x1 arcsec slitlets. The two cameras are both CCD-based and optimized for their respective blue or red ends of the spectrum. To maximize sky subtraction, the \u201cinterleaved nod-and-shuffle\u201d process will be utilised. Along with Volume Phase Holographic (VPH) gratings offering resolutions of 3000 and 7000, 30% throughput (including atmosphere and detector) is also attained. The use of transmissive coated optics and optimised mirror coatings further enhances WiFeS's performance. In order to enrich the scientific output, all aspects of the instrument have been placed in a remote observing configuration, with pipeline data reduction and collated calibration image libraries available for use."}
{"text":"This paper examines the highly variable IDV source J1128+592 and its conspicuous annual modulation of the variability time scale. It is one of only two sources known with a well-constrained seasonal cycle and one of a few others where annual modulation has been proposed. It was observed with the Effelsberg 100-m radio telescope and the Urumqi 25-m radio telescope and its flux-density measurements indicated a annual modulation of the variability time scale. However 4 recent observations in 2006\/7 did not fit to the previous annual modulation model. This paper looks into a possible explanation of the discrepancy."}
{"text":"\nIn this work, we explore a supersymmetric standard model based on three $\\mathbf{27}$ representations of the $E_6$ gauge group that leads to the unification of gauge coupling forces with gravity near the Planck scale of $10^{19}$ GeV. The conventional GUT scale is set at $10^{16}$ GeV with a supersymmetric Pati-Salam model that enjoys the advantages of an SO(10) GUT.  The associated low-energy exotic states might be detectable in LHC experiments, thus providing the potential to uncover an underlying $E_6$ gauge group initiated at $M_P$.

The 3-dimensional, energy-conserving model we employed shows that the entire extent of the disk (from the highest atmospheric layer to the bottom) is magnetically supported, but that a steady-state is not reached. Instead, the total energy content of the segment fluctuates with no secular trend over timescales of several tens of orbits. Furthermore, the dissipation rate and the ratio of radiation to gas pressure differ over a 0.5-2 range, respectively, and the locally-averaged, mass-dependent dissipation rate is proportional to m^{-1\/2}. Finally, it is established that the energy transportation out of the system is predominantly through radiative diffusion, with Poynding flux playing a much lesser role."}
{"text":"This article evaluates the transition from an impurity band (IB) to a valence band (VB) regime of diluted magnetic semiconductors (DMS) in terms of magnetic impurity concentration, taking into account the Coulomb attraction between carriers and magnetic impurities. We employ Dynamical Mean-Field Theory (DMFT) and Monte Carlo (MC) calculations to analyze the density of states and the ferromagnetic transition temperature. The results suggest a square-well-like potential to initiate an IB at lower magnetic doping levels than that previously thought to be possible. Additionally, the range of the Coulomb attraction is shown to be an important factor in the renormalization of the $p-d$ exchange $J$; it is found that the on-site attraction can effectively renormalize $J$ across all values of $x$, while a nearest-neighbor range attraction can be relied upon at low doping levels only.These findings indicate that the Coulomb attraction should be taken into account when studying Mn-doped GaN, which is expected to be in the IB regime."}
{"text":"\nWe have used a 3-dimensional radiation magnetohydrodynamic code to investigate the vertical structure and thermodynamics of a disk annular segment where both the gas pressure and radiation pressure would be of similar magnitude. Our results indicate strong evidence of Parker instabilities as the dominant magnetic support in the upper layers of the disc, resulting in a complex photosphere with significant density variations at the scattering and thermalization photospheres. Such inhomogeneities could significantly change both the spectrum and polarization of thermal photons emerging from the disk atmosphere, as well as impacting models used to predict their reflection spectra."}
{"text":"\nThe study of wavelength assignment for multicast transmissions over optical networks motivates the introduction of $n$-fibre colourings of labelled digraphs. In this article, we investigate the minimum number of colours $\\lambda_n(D)$ such that a given $m$-labelled digraph $D$ has an $n$-fibre colouring. Specifically, we consider the case of a $1$-labelled digraph, which we call the directed star arboricity. We derive an upper bound of $2\\Delta^-(D) + 1$ for directed star arboricity, and conjecture that if $\\Delta^-(D) \\geq 2$, then the bound can be further improved to $2\\Delta^-(D)$. Additionally, for a subcubic digraph we prove the weaker bound of $3$, and the even weaker bound of $4$ if $\\Delta^+(D)$ and $\\Delta^-(D)$ are both at most $2$. Lastly, we obtain upper and lower bounds of $\\lambda_n(m,k)$ and conjecture that the lower bound is the true value."}
{"text":"\nResearchers conducted molecular line observations of the starless globule FeSt 1-457 in order to analyze its kinematics and chemical properties. The self-reversed and asymmetric profiles of the HCO+ and CS spectra across the face of the globule were noticed, suggesting the presence of expansion motions in the globule's outer layers. It was also determined that these motions were subsonic and below the escape velocity, indicating that the globule is gravitationally bound. After comparing the observations to near-infrared extinction data, it was suggested that the observed expansion has its roots in an oscillatory motion amd the globule is in a quasi-stable state near hydrostatic equilibrium. The analysis of the observed linewidths concluded that thermal pressure is the primary internal support mechanism of the cloud. A calculation suggested that the dominant oscillation period is around 0.3 Myr, potentially accounting for the double-peaked structure of the core in the high resolution extinction maps. Lastly, comparisons between the molecular-line observations and extinction data have revealed potential evidence for depletion of C18O and HCO+, and possibly no depletion for N2H+ up to 40 magnitudes of visual extinction."}
{"text":"\nUsing high resolution observations of CS, HCO+, C18O and N2H+ molecules, we investigated the kinematics and chemistry of the starless globule FeSt 1-457. The forensic study of the emission and absorption spectra determined that the surface of the globule exhibits an asymmetric profile suggestive of an expanding motion. Coupled with the comparison of our observations with near-infrared extinction data, it implies that the globule is gravitationally bound. Analyzing the widths of CO and N2H+ indicates that thermal pressure is the bulk of the cloud's support. Modeling the observed periods suggest that a large amplitude l = 2 pulsation could be present in the globule, which may be responsible for the double-peaked structure noted in high resolution extinction maps. Additionally, further comparison of spectral features and extinction data revealed potential depletion of C18O and HCO+ by amounts up to 40 magnitudes of visual extinction in the core."}
{"text":"\nExploring the three-dimensional geometry of the universe is an important area of research in cosmology. Recent evidence from observational data sourced from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), galaxy surveys and Type Ia supernovae suggest that the universe may posses a curvature close to zero if dominated by a cosmological constant or dark energy with a constant equation of state. This article investigates the potential influence of cosmic priors on studying the constraints of geometry and finds that uncertainties on the curvature and parameters of matter and dark energy are much larger. Furthermore, it is proposed that future dark energy experiments teamed with the CMB data from experiments such as Planck will bring us closer to uncovering any potential impacts of quantum gravity on curvature."}
{"text":"\nThis paper studies ideals in the ring $C^\\infty(M,R)$ of smooth functions on a compact smooth manifold M, or more generally, submodules of a finitely generated $C^\\infty(M,R)$-module V.

This principle states that the jet prolongation map from the space of smooth maps from a compact manifold M to a Euclidean space E, to the space of smooth sections of the jet bundle $J^r(M,E)$, when restricted to certain 'nonsingular' subsets, is a cohomology isomorphism. This theorem is then extended to topological $C^\\infty(M,R)$-modules, and a further strengthening of the result is achieved, with the homotopy fibres having zero homology."}
{"text":"This paper provides an in-depth overview of the mathematics and computing of Hartree-Fock Self-Consistent Field (SCF) methods in Quantum Chemistry. We provide an overview of the steps taken from the molecular Hamiltonian to arrive at the Hartree and Hartree-Fock equations for the electronic problem and emphasize the most essential mathematical aspects of the derivation. Additionally, all Hartree-Fock versions, as well as different spin restrictions, are extracted from the general case in order to provide a unifying framework. Afterwards, the Roothaan-Hall formalism is introduced along with a review of the basic concepts and algorithmic efficiency of the Gaussian basis sets. The paper is concluded by studying the relevant modern developments regarding linear scaling methods and the issues discussed throughout the review. With this paper, we intend to contribute to the education of non-experts in quantum chemical methods and serve as a useful reference for those unfamiliar with the subject."}
{"text":"\nIn this article, we study the stability of the periodic Toda lattice (and related algebro-geometric finite-gap) lattice under a small perturbation. We prove that the perturbed lattice will converge to a modulated lattice. For a given unperturbed solution with hyperelliptic curve and genus $g$, we identify $g+2$ distinct areas in the $n\/t$-plane which indicate proximity to a finite-gap solution in the same isospectral torus. Additionally, we observe $g+1$ regions where the prevailing solution closes in on a modulated lattice which gradually changes phase in the Jacobian variety and reconciles the isospectral solutions. In the case of the free lattice ($g=0$), the single-point isospectral torus provides the expected result.\n\nTo achieve this, we link the inverse spectral problem to a matrix Riemann\u2013Hilbert problem defined for a hyperelliptic curve and develop a nonlinear stationary phase\/steepest descent method for deformations of Riemann -Hilbert problems on Riemann surfaces. Characterizations of the isospectral torus solutions and phase transition in terms of Abelian integrals on the hyperelliptic curve are also provided."}
{"text":"We consider a scaling law that links the stresses originating from saturated, MRI-driven turbulence in non-stratified, shearing boxes to the strength of the vertical magnetic field, the sound speed, the box's vertical size, and the numerical resolution. Upon analyzing information from 35 simulations with a range of physical variables, we prove that the stress associated with zero net magnetic flux is directly proportional to the numerical resolution. Hence, these stresses would be insignificant if the resolution were equivalent to the dissipation scale taking place in astrophysical disks. Consequently, the turbulent angular momentum exchange occurring within the disk must be supported by a significant vertical magnetic field with turbulent magnetic energy nearly equal to the thermal energy. This has substantial repercussions for the spectrum of accretion disks and their stability."}
{"text":"\nIn order to develop a strong economy and maintain a high quality of life, bridging the gap between theory and practical application is essential. Previous studies on this issue, however, have not explored the interplay between university and industry using a network perspective. To fill this gap, we applied the latest network theory methods to study the impact of the 5th Framework Programme of the European Union research and technological advances. Specifically, we analysed the role of companies and scientific institutions to strengthen the link between research and industry. Our results provide quantitative evidence that, despite firms being hierarchically structured by size, universities and research organisations keep the network connected, providing an effective knowledge transfer."}

{"text":"This article explores the concept of galactic accretion continuing through the cooling of the baryonic halo, with the condensed clouds formed being comparable with the High-Velocity Clouds (HVCs) observed in the neutral hydrogen around our Galaxy. Results are compared between the simulation of galaxy formation and the observations of HVCs and the extra-planar gas around the Andromeda galaxy. The simulation supports the accretion of the clouds only accounting for ~ 0.2 M_solar \/ year of the overall galactic accretion. Additionally, the simulation indicates that lower-velocity gas can mask a portion of the clouds, indicating there may be a population of HVCs that is currently unidentified. These discoveries suggest that the majority of HVCs are created as a leftover from Galaxy formation."}
{"text":"\nWe study the intrinsic shapes of starless molecular cloud cores located in the Orion GMC by utilizing a maximum-likelihood method that reconstructs axial ratios of projected plane-of-the-sky core ellipses using data from the prestellar core sample of Nutter and Ward-Thompson (2007). Our results demonstrate a substantial inclination for oblate cores of finite thickness to form in the Orion GMC over prolate cores. We also compare the distribution of intrinsic shapes in the Orion GMC with a uniform distribution of shapes akin to those seen in gravoturbulent fragmentation simulations. This comparison shows that the observed data are inconsistent with the uniform distribution of shapes at the 0.1% level, highlighting the implications of these findings for theories of core formation in molecular clouds."}
{"text":"\nThis paper explores the ramifications of Wilsonian effective actions, obtained by integrating out views above a specific scale $\\mu$. We introduce a manifestly Lorentz invariant and global symmetry preserving prescription which uses an infrared cut off at this scale. This opens up a discussion around the gauge invariance of effective actions in general, and particularly when using the background field method. We demonstrate that for Supersymmetric gauge theories, all non-gauge invariant terms cancel within each supermultiplet, providing strong evidence that this prescription outlines a Lorentz, Supersymmetry and gauge invariant action. We provide a one-loop calculation of couplings for higher-derivative terms $F D^{2n}F$ in all Supersymmetric gauge theories as a result."}

{"text":"\nWe present a technique to measure both the spin-spin correlation function and the magnetoelastic coupling in the quantum magnet NiCl$_2$-4SC(NH$_2$)$_2$ through magnetostriction. We measure magnetostriction by subjecting the material to field-induced canted antiferromagnetism between $H_{c1} = 2.1$ T and $H_{c2} = 12.6$ T and uniaxial stress between neighboring Ni atoms along the c-axis. The uniaxial strain is linked to the nearest neighbor (NN) exchange coupling and lattice parameter. Quantum Monte Carlo calculations of the NN spin-spin correlation function are in good agreement with our measured magnetostriction data taken at 25 mK. We also measure Young's modulus using resonant ultrasound and can thus conclude that there was a 7.5 mK change in $J_c$ between $H_{c1}$ and $H_{c2}$ due to a 0.022% change in length of the sample."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate the evidence indicating a possible 'Hubble bubble': a separation between the locally measured Hubble constant and its average value \\citep{Jha:07}. After contrasting the MLCS2k2 light-curve fitting of the data with various other light-curve fitters, we identify a correlation between the Type Ia supernova's colour surplus corrected for a shape-colour relation, and the colour gradient across the local sample. If the colour insurgence is empirically fit, the bubble ceases to exist. However, if it results from a dust like the Milky Way, then the bubble persists. Our research produced a $\\beta$ of about 2, indicating the dust which is diffused around the supernova remnant may have something unique about it. This reveals both a challenge and a chance for future SN Ia cosmological surveys."}
{"text":"\nUsing supernovae at redshifts up to 0.08, we observe peculiar velocities with unprecedented precision.

Visually, the velocity field appears to be a bipolar form which extends from 0.007 to $z\\sim 0.025$ and likely beyond. Further, there is an estimated 270 km\/s random component to the field inside the volume at 0.01. The CMAGIC and maximum light metrics show considerable improvements in the Hubble expansion measurements following the correction of this streaming motion, with a decrease in $\\chi^2$ from 90 to 63 and a residual scatter of 0.12 magnitude."}
{"text":"\nThis paper explores the possibility of using separable operations to transform one bipartite entangled state $\\ket{\\psi}$ into another $\\ket{\\phi}$. If the separable operation is a local operation with classical communication (LOCC), Nielsen's theorem states the necessary and sufficient conditions for the transformation to occur. When this isn't the case, we show that at least one necessary condition requires that products of the Schmidt coefficients of $\\ket{\\psi}$ and $\\ket{\\phi}$ be equal. As a result, it is not possible to use separable operations to reverse the transformation by another separable operation unless the Schmidt coefficients of $\\ket{\\psi}$ and $\\ket{\\phi}$ are the same. Furthermore, we examine the situation when the Schmidt coefficients are equal, deriving conditions for the deterministic transformation of a collection of several full Schmidt rank pure states $\\ket{\\psi_j}$ to pure states $\\ket{\\phi_j}$. Finally, we also present sufficient conditions for the general separable transformation, although further research is still necessary."}
{"text":"\nThrough the use of an immunohistochemical method utilizing no antigen retrieval (AR) by pressure cooking and a detection kit based on the labeled streptavidin biotin (LSAB) method, we identified the cytoplasmic zinc metalloprotease insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) in normal and neoplastic human tissues. An important outcome of our experiments is that the combination of a blocking step with 3% hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and an incubation of the biotinylated secondary antibody at room temperature (RT), not at 37 degrees Celsius, revealed nearly no IDE expression in a breast cancer specimen surveyed previously. Our findings forewarn potential immunohistochemical pitfalls including pressure cooking for AR, insufficient quenching of endogenous peroxidases, and heating of tissue sections during incubation with biotinylated secondary antibodies, which can give inaccurate, false-positive results."}
{"text":"\nThe current study looks at creating and propagating order along Ising spin chains using geodesics, affording the possibility of ultra-fast control over quantum mechanical ensembles by reducing the time it takes for unitary transformations. Results suggest that it is possible to spread a spin order along an Ising spin chain at speeds much faster than initially thought -- 1\/2J Hz per step -- opening up new possibilities for controlling spin dynamics in coherent spectroscopy and quantum information processing. Experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the synthesized unitary transformations and these methods are expected to lead to further applications."}
{"text":"\n\nWe investigate supersymmetric N=2 gauge theory which features BPS domain walls with an included U(1) gauge field localized on its worldvolume. We explore the dynamic properties of some new particle-like solitons, whose topologies can have any arbitrary genus. We particularly consider the Q tori solitons, which we refer to as \u2018Flying Saucer' solitons. These are generated by folding the domain wall into an appropriate surface and stabilized through crossed electric and magnetic fields. To analyze the character of these Q tori, we construct three distinct frameworks: a worldvolume description, a bulk theory description in the sigma-model limit, and a bulk theory description furnished in the thin-edge approximation. Through investigation of these, we uncover a link between the Q torus and Hopf Skyrmion previously studied."}
{"text":"\nThis paper explores the mid-infrared spectrum of the HD 98800 quadruple star system, which is located in the 10 million year old TW Hydrae association. Using the Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph (IRS), we found that HD 98800 B lacks any excess emission below 5.5 micron, implying an optically thick disk wall of 5.9 AU and an inner cleared-out region. We further discovered that 3-micron-sized silicate grains are being held in an outer ring between 1.5 and 2 AU. This structure and lack of gas suggest that HD 98800 B is likely already in the debris disk stage. We conclude that the IR excess can be explained by the Aa + Ab pair's gravitational perturbations of the dust ring, causing frequent collisions among larger particles."}
{"text":"\nThis paper explores the effects of short-range attractions on the properties of a fluid including local structural ordering, viscosity, and self-diffusivity. Our simulations of both a hard-sphere and square-well fluid show the existence of a \"cascade of anomalies\" where an increase in structural ordering takes place upon isochoric heating. We link the breakdown of the Stokes-Einstein relation to the difference in coupling between mobility and structural ordering in these two fluid systems. Our results reveal how repulsive and attractive glasses may differ in terms of their short-range structural ordering, and we shed light on the dynamic heterogeneity associated with them."}

Furthermore, there is a picture of an atomic hydrogen column density of $N_{HI}$ which is around 2 x 10^{22} cm^{-2}, with a ROSAT PSPC observation present of a diffuse X-ray enhancement apparently linked to G18.8+0.3.

{"text":"\nWe analyze the statistics of strong C IV absorption systems at z=1.5-3.5 toward gamma-ray bursts. Surprisingly, the rate of absorption (per unit redshift) is not higher than that observed toward quasar sightlines.

Furthermore, the distribution of equivalent widths of the two samples is consistent with being drawn from the same parent population. With larger statistical samples, future studies may be able to probe properties of the galaxies hosting the metals, such as mass and dust content, and the structure of the medium causing the metal line absorption."}
{"text":"\nThe unique and disruptive effect of imperfections in silver chalcogenides creates a non-saturating transverse magnetoresistance (MR) exhibiting a linear response when current is passed through the material. This is demonstrated by the presence of a negative longitudinal MR, visible in three-dimensional limits, that highlights a characteristic length scale set by the material's inhomogeneity. Experiments in both Ag$_{2\\pm\\delta}$Se and Ag$_{2\\pm\\delta}$Te, and magnetic fields up to 55 T, revealed the distorted current paths theorized in simulations, elucidated by the diagonal and off-diagonal components of the resistivity tensor. Synchronously, a random resistor network model was able to fit the linear MR and conclusively demonstrate the magnitude of inhomogeneous conducting paths, up to a length of 10 microns. Therefore, the research suggests that the physical mechanism for the observed magnetic resistance is large, macroscopic inhomogeneities."}
{"text":"\nThis article studies the class of f(R) dark energy models which successfully demonstrate a matter dominated epoch preceding a later time acceleration. To assess the divergence from the LambdaCDM model one takes into account the function m=Rf_{,RR}\/f_{,R}. In the viable f(R) models the equation of state w_DE takes on two specific features: w_DE diverging at a certain redshift z_c and crossing the cosmological constant boundary (phantom crossing) at z_b, which is smaller than z_c. By examining the observational data of Supernova Ia and Cosmic Microwave background, it was discovered that m<O(0.1), and the phantom crossing could appear at z_b>1 which is already observable. Considering the local gravity constraints, the proportion m is limited to a value much smaller than 1 but much larger than the present cosmological density. The representative models that agree with the cosmological and local gravity constraints take the form m(r)=C(-r-1)^p when r approaches -1, where p>1."}
{"text":"\nUsing high-time-resolution spectroscopy from the New Technology Telescope (NTT) and the Very Large Telescope (VLT) of the European Southern Observatory, Chile, we study the AM CVn stars HP Librae and V803 Centauri. Our results suggest a discrepancy in the orbital period of V803 Cen previously found in photometric studies. We detect a periodic S-wave feature in the binary's spectrogram which we measure to have a spectroscopic period P=1596.4+\/-1.2s, significantly shorter than the 1611-second period observed in the literature. We conclude that the 1611-second period likely corresponds to a `superhump', while our spectroscopic period is likely the true orbital period of the binary, potentially altering the inferred mass ratio to q~0.07 instead of q~0.016. This implies the donor star need not be totally degenerate, and the accreting white dwarf may not need to be very close to the Chandrasekhar limit. Similarly, for HP Lib, we find a spectroscopic period P=1102.8+\/-0.2s, in agreement with the published photometric periods and the derived constraints on the component masses."}
{"text":"\nA field deployment system designed for the Mileura Widefield Array's Low Frequency Demonstrator (MWA-LFD) has been employed to detect giant pulses from the Crab Nebula pulsar at 200 MHz.

{"text":"\nThis paper describes the use of Bayesian techniques to reconstruct the cosmic large-scale structure from observational data. We discuss how generic linear data models can be represented in terms of signal prior, data likelihood, and numerical inverse extra-regularization schemes. Additionally, the ARGO software package is developed to apply these techniques in an efficient manner using fast Fourier transforms. Benchmarking is done on problem sets of 1, 2, or 3 dimensions with different types of noise, windowing and blurring effects. As a result, a novel numerical Krylov scheme is identified as having superior accuracy with respects to the other candidates. With this we theoretically make the Gibbs sampling process possible to explore complex joint posterior distributions jointly for the dark matter density field, the peculiar velocity field, and the power spectrum. This can be used to assess the redshift distortion of observed galaxies, and even to reconstruct the initial density field in a time-reversal manner."}

{"text":"The physical properties of low energy supersymmetric models provide potential resolutions to both the hierarchy problem and outstanding issues in cosmology, including dark matter and baryonic matter. These theories are testable in near-future collider experiments, such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and International Linear Collider (ILC), due to the weak-scale interaction parameters. Recently, the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) was extended with a singlet chiral superfield, ultimately producing a so-called nMSSM, which presents a viable answer to both baryogenesis and dark matter. This paper reflects on the implications of the nMSSM from cosmology and how it is represented in the LHC and ILC. We discuss how the ILC can verify the neutralino, chargino, and Higgs sectors in the theory, compare them with cosmological hypotheses, and examine prospects for detecting dark matter with further experiments. Also included is an assessment of the current understanding of the electron electric dipole moment when applied to the nMSSM."}
{"text":"\nThis study used the Japanese-led VSOP space VLBI project, which extends baseline lengths up to 36,000 km and resolving structures to 0.3 mas, to investigate the transversal structure of extragalactic jet 0836+710 at 1.6 and 5 GHz. A linear stability analysis was applied to the data to identify which of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities could explain the large-scale structures observed in this jet. Our results demonstrate that the stratified jet can be reproduced by both the helical surface and helical\/elliptic body modes of instability, with the helical surface mode driving frequency delivering insights into the physics of the active nucleus."}
{"text":"\nIn this work, the cosmic radiation density, traditionally parameterized as the effective number of neutrino species N_eff, is investigated using precision cosmology data. By accounting for scale-dependent biasing in the galaxy power spectrum, it is concluded that N_eff lies in the range of 1.1 to 4.8 (95% C.L.) with a best-fit of 2.6 when linear regimes are taken into consideration. With the addition of smaller-scale data, like the Lyman-alpha forest, the range becomes 2.2 to 5.8 (95% C.L.) with a best-fit of 3.8. Further investigations suggest that, when nonzero mass for N_eff neutrino flavours, a running scalar spectral index, and a dark energy parameter are added, the N_eff limits become 0.8 to 6.1 (95% C.L.) with a best-fit of 3.0. This observation is contrary to some claims from other authors."}
{"text":"This study considers the linear and non-linear stability of high Lorentz factor shear jets. Combining analytical approaches with high-resolution relativistic hydrodynamic simulations, we identified resonant modes specific to the relativistic shear layer, verified the linear analysis via numerical simulations and followed the instability development during the non-linear regime. Our findings indicate that these modes with significant growth rates may have a bearing on the global stability of the jets, depending on the jet flow Lorentz factor and specific internal energy as well as the thickness of the shear layer. Such insights could have implications for the physics of extragalactic relativistic jets."}
{"text":"\nWe have studied the distribution of quasars in close proximity to galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey data. Our analysis supports the hypothesis that these types of quasars, known as 'close pairs', are gravitationally lensed by globular clusters in the halos of elliptical and spiral galaxies. We find that quasars which form close pairs tend to follow the rich density profiles of globular clusters in these types of galaxies, with slopes of -1.5 and -2.4 respectively. This implies a mutual relationship between quasars and galaxies, in which the lensing effects of globular clusters are likely key to their proximity."}
{"text":"\nSpectroscopy at an intermediate resolution of the white dwarf SDSSJ104341.53+085558.2 has shown the presence of double-peaked emission lines of CaII8498,8542,8662, which confirms its status as the second single white dwarf known to have a gas disk of metal-rich material around it, similar to that of SDSSJ1228+1040. The measurement of the MgII4481 absorption line in the photosphere of the white dwarf showed a Magnesium abundance that was 0.3 times the solar value, indicating that the star is currently accreting from the debris disc. The lack of Balmer emission lines, as well as of photospheric HeI4471 absorption, implies that the matter being accreted does not contain large amounts of volatile elements. Furthermore, analysis of the 7360 white dwarfs surveyed in SDSS DR4 did not uncover additional strong \"metal gas disc\" candidates, suggesting that these objects are not common. To back up this conclusion, spectroscopic investigations of other white dwarf stars, such as GD362 and WD1337+705, found no CaII emission lines. However, since GD362 is known to have an associated dust disc and a rather low temperature, it is likely that not enough material has been made gas for it to generate a detectable CaII emission. WD1337+705 was found to be the one of the three stars observed with the lowest Mg abundance, implying that there may be a correlation between photospheric Mg abundance and the strength of the CaII emission triplet."}

As a result, both kinematic and current helicity are created, which corresponds to the suggested relation H~B^0_i B^0_j Omega_i,j, and this process produces remarkable amounts of helicity. Additionally, the produced helicity creates an axial alpha-effect, linked by a characteristic time scale of about the rotation time. Without an axial field B^0, no helicity or alpha-effect is produced."}
{"text":"This paper presents a generic discrete-event random simulation model, VOODB, to assess the performances of object-oriented databases (OODBs) and optimization techniques like clustering. The model was developed through a modelling approach and tested with two distinct OODBs, the O2 OODB and Texas persistent object store, as well as the DSTC clustering technique implemented in Texas. The results from benchmarking and simulation were in agreement, thus supporting the use of simulation to evaluate the performance of OODBs."}
{"text":"\nThis paper aims to reveal the source of magnetoelectric behavior in BiFeO$_3$ by investigating the structural, electronic, magnetic, and ferroelectric properties of this material. Accurate density functional calculations without strong correlation effects are used to reproduce the observed cuboctahedral lattice expansion in the [111] direction, as well as a pressure-induced structural transition. Band-structure calculations predict that BiFeO$_3$ is an insulator in an A- and G-type antiferromagnetic phase and a metal in other magnetic configurations. Results from the electron localization function analysis indicate that the ferroelectricity is caused by sterically active lone-pair electrons at the Bi sites. A large ferroelectric polarization of 88.7 $\\mu$C\/cm$^{2}$ is expected from this research, which is in agreement with recent experimental findings. Moreover, the large variations in the ferroelectric polarization are due to the anisotropy in the spontaneous polarization."}
{"text":"\nWe present the first detection of SiI, CaI and FeI at z~0.45 in the UVES high resolution spectrum of a QSO HE0001-2340. This weak MgII absorption system has characteristics that contradict those of typical weak MgII systems, Damped Ly-alpha systems, and local interstellar cold clouds. We use photoionization modeling to explore the absorber\u2019s ionization conditions, finding that the observed ionic abundance ratios cannot be adequately reproduced using a single-cloud, uniform-density model. This suggests a more complex density structure for the absorber. The leading unpredicted outcome is the system\u2019s underabundance of magnesium in comparison to iron -- henceforth challenging longstanding theories regarding nucleosynthesis and differential dust depletion."}
{"text":"\nThis research sets out to explore the systematic uncertainties encountered in the use of Shifman-Vainshtein-Zakharov (SVZ) sum rules to identify the parameters of hadron ground-states. We put this idea to the test by utilising the harmonic-oscillator potential model in a bid to uncover the influence of hadron continuum on the extraction of the square of the ground-state wave function, $R\\propto|\\Psi_0(\\vec r=0)|^2$ from an SVZ sum rule. Results indicate that the hadron continuum exhibits a major part in establishing the output of the sum rule and the exact value of $R$, though when the exact continuum is not known, it is difficult to control the systematic uncertainties of the procedure."}
{"text":"\nThis study provides the first observational evidence that a decrease in gas temperature takes place in the inner 5000 AU of pre-stellar cores. This phenomenom was witnessed in the starless core L 1544 through the VLA and Plateau de Bure observations of the NH3 (1,1) and (2,2) transitions as well as the 110 GHz 111-101 para-NH2D line. This allowed us to measure the temperature gradient between the core nucleus and the envelope with a resolution smaller than 1000 AU. Our analysis of the temperature data showed a drop from 12 K down to 5.5 K, resulting in a 50% increase in the estimated density. Additionally, an abundance of deuterated ammonia compared to the ammonia abundance of 50%+-20% was measured at such high densities (2e6 cm-3), exceeding previous single-dish observations. Lastly, diminished angular momentum from the larger scales to the core nucleus was measured."}
{"text":"\nThis article discusses a novel binary-object formation model relying on the concept of chaos-assisted capture. We utilize calculations in the three- and four-body Hill approximation to identify the composition, velocity, and orbital element distributions which help to facilitate binary formation. After analyzing particle scattering in the circular Hill four-body simulation, our model provides explanations for the random mutual orbit inclinations and asymmetric distributions of prograde and retrograde orbits observed in the trans-Neptunian region. In our exploration of the 'fine-tuning' of this model recently proposed by Noll et al., we also consider the implications of our findings on binary formation rates. Ultimately, our analysis adds to the understanding and characterization of the conditions in the trans-Neptunian area of the Solar System."}
{"text":"In this article, a statistical sample of the most isolated galaxies in the local Universe is constructed using the Catalogue of Isolated Galaxies (CIG, Karachentseva 1973; 1050 galaxies) as a starting point to refine and quantify its isolation properties. Using digitised POSS-I E images, 54,000 potential neighbours were identified in fields with a minimum projected radius R > 0.5 Mpc around 950 CIG galaxies, of which 30% were equipped with redshift data. Out of these, 666 pass and 284 fail the original isolation criterion. The exclusion of neighbours within a factor of four in size around each CIG is estimated to involve neighbours located no closer than Delta Vr ~ 18000 km s-1. This study highlights the varying levels of isolation among galaxies in the CIG, and affirms the necessity to quantitatively measure this as a subject for future research."}
{"text":"\nThe goal of this study is to identify wave activity within sunspot penumbras. To do this, infrared spectropolarimetric data is inverted to form two separate atmospheric layers in each spatial pixel. By computing the Fourier phase differences, as well as vertical separations of the signals in each component, time delays between oscillations in the ranges 2.5-4.5 mHz and the corresponding speed of atmospheric waves are measured. Comparison of these measurements to the shape of response functions for the observed spectral lines indicate that modified p-mode waves are best represented when propagating at an angle of about 50 degrees to the vertical."}
{"text":"This paper details a systematic and explicit Hamiltonian derivation of the energy and angular momenta of black hole solutions with both asymptotically flat and asymptotically anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetimes in any dimension D greater than or equal to 4. A precise determination of the asymptotic conditions of the metric and its conjugate momentum is required for this. It turns out such conditions are aligned with an ellipsoidal coordinate system suited for rotating solutions. The boundary conditions are then obtained, which differs from the standard parity conditions established by Regge and Teitelboim and provide a platform for the finite angular momentum computation. The charges calculated by this method are then compared with thermodynamic results, which agree with each other."}
{"text":"This paper presents a Metropolis Algorithm-based sampling method that is suitable for exploring moderate-dimensional spaces from multi-modal distributions. The technique requires an existing 'bank' or 'cache' of points that are presumed to be close to the regions of interest in the distribution being sampled. These points can be gathered through past studies, failed sampling efforts, or other methods. The algorithm is shown to be efficient even with weakened clues, though optimal performance will only be achieved when clues are helpful."}
{"text":"This paper examines different priors for the CMSSM parameters used in LHC forecasts and their effect on fitting to indirect constraints. Our new and more natural prior with a measure in mu and B gives rise to a well defined fine-tuning measure in the parameter space. We demonstrate how our choice alters global CMSSM fits to indirect constraints and discuss its implications on Large Hadron Collider (LHC) sparticle production cross sections, such as the pseudoscalar Higgs boson dark matter annihilation region, and on probable values of sparticle masses. We also compare and contrast Bayesian and frequentist interpretations of CMSSM fits and demonstrate how to interpret fit information from a Markov Chain Monte Carlo in a frequentist fashion."}
{"text":"\nThis research examines how newly developed object classification techniques can be used to increase the effectiveness of the Nearby Supernova Factory's supernova search. In contrast to traditional techniques which utilize simple parameter thresholds to filter out objects such as asteroids, cosmic rays, and subtraction artifacts, we applied more effective methods such as Boosted Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines. This allowed for a reduction in the amount of manual inspection by a factor of 10 while also improving the overall supernova identification rate. We believe that these same methods can be used for efficient alert production and false positive rejection in projects such as PanSTARRS and LSST to help reduce the workload required for supernova detection."}
{"text":"\nThis paper examines the possibility of doping high-$T_c$ cuprates with free electrons which are sourced from transfer of charge at the interface with manganites (or other oxides) through heterostructure geometries. By analyzing photoemission and diffusion voltage experiments, it can be seen that the Fermi level of manganites is positioned higher than the bottom of the upper Hubbard band of cuprate parent compounds. Our research results in a diagram with the relative location of Fermi levels and gaps for a variety of oxides, as well as in a generic indication of the direction of charge flow at the interfaces between them. Model calculations using static and dynamical mean-field theory and supplemented by a Poisson equation to address the redistribution of charge at the interface, suggest that this transfer of electrons to an antiferromagnetic Cu oxide can result in a superconducting state, provided that minimal quenched disorder is present. Furthermore, this process appears to be more successful when the magnetic state of the manganites is antiferromagnetic instead of ferromagnetic, since spin-polarized charge transfer has a negative effect on singlet superconductivity. Therefore, the electron doping of undoped cuprates at interfaces can be made possible, and this opens up a new area of research in oxide heterostructures."}
{"text":" By looking at contact processes through the lens of percolation techniques, the study of the spread of disease has been enhanced. This can be further expanded upon by looking at an undirected percolation model in which the time-axis is unoriented and viewed from a random-cluster model perspective on $\\ZZ \\times \\RR$. In addition to providing insight into disease spread and transmission, this has enabled the formulation of a path-integral representation of the quantum Ising model with a transverse field to be developed, which in turn can be used to understand the entanglement between a finite set of spins in the quantum Ising system. Furthermore, the mean-field version of the quantum Ising system generates a random-cluster model on $K_n \\times \\RR$ which is an extension of the Erdos-Renyi random graph."}
{"text":"\nA study was conducted to assess the viability of using Vibration-induced Conductivity Fluctuation (VICOF) for measuring soil bulk density in field conditions. A paired set of blade-like electrodes was positioned on the soil, with one in the longitudinal direction and the other transverse to the vibration source for the purpose of obtaining a normalized index. Experiments were conducted on various soil compositions and moisture levels, with four different bulk densities. The results from dry sand pointed to a negative correlation of the normalized conductivity fluctuation with soil bulk density for both transverse and longitudinal positions of electrodes. Simulation models on a resistor lattice found that transverse fluctuation increased with decreasing bulk density. Unfortunately, there were very similar outcomes in both natural and salinized wet soils with no considerable change in the VICOF response to bulk density. The blade-like electrodes employed in this experiment were found to improve electrode-to-soil contact compared to cylindrical electrodes, and by doing this, reduced measurement noise."}
{"text":"\nIn this paper, we explore the relationship between Leonard triples and hypercubes. Let $V$ denote a vector space over complex numbers with finite and positive dimension, and consider an ordered triple of linear operators on $V$. For each operator, there is a basis of $V$ with respect to which the matrices of the other two operators are irreducibly tridiagonal. Furthermore, we fix a positive integer $D$, and let $Q_D$ denote the graph of a $D$-dimensional hypercube with vertex set $X$. Let $A$ denote the adjacency matrix of $Q_D$, and $A^*$ the corresponding dual adjacency matrix. Moreover, let $T$ denote the associated subalgebra generated by both $A; A^*$. The matrices $A$ and $A^*$ are related through the relation $2 \\im A = A^* A^e - A^e A^*$ and $2 \\im A^* = A^e A - A A^e$, where $2 \\im A^e = A A^* - A^* A$ and $\\im^2=-1$. Our results demonstrate that the triple $A$, $A^*$, $A^e$ acts on each irreducible $T$-module as a Leonard triple. In addition, we give a detailed description of these Leonard triples."}
{"text":"This article examines the propagation of errors, with a focus on the theoretical advancements that have been made in this field. It discusses how first and second order differential calculus can be used to analyse errors, as well as examining the relationship between error propagation and the concept of second order vector in differential geometry. Additionally, the article examines the powerful framework of Dirichlet forms, which is able to easily apply to infinite dimensional models. It also discusses how errors, in the form of approximate quantities, can yield a Dirichlet form and introduces four bias operators. Finally, the article connects the Dirichlet form with Statistics by identifying the square of a field operator with the inverse of the Fisher information matrix."}
{"text":"This paper sheds light on the physics behind electron heating in low states when\naccreting black holes are present. We find that there is compelling evidence of\nefficient electron heating caused by the MHD turbulence generated by the\nmagneto-rotational instability, which must be taken into account when considering\nthe effects of viscous stress driving accretion. Furthermore, there is a\ncritical mass accretion rate, below which a two-temperature flow can be\nestablished and maintained by the combination of bremsstrahlung, synchrotron, and\ninverse Comptonization cooling processes. Coulomb collisions become inefficient\nunder these conditions, and collision-less heating by MHD turbulence becomes\nmore important."}
{"text":"\nAnalysis of large-scale radiative transfer and structure formation simulations,\nbased on cosmologies from WMAP 1-year and 3-year data, has allowed us to study\nthe dependence between the reionization history and halo mass of regions in the\nUniverse. We find the mean reionization timeline and the probability of\ninternal\/external reionization vary between haloes of different masses and\nenvironments, with a rapid transition between predominantly external and\npredominantly internal reionization at a halo mass scale of 1.0e12 Msun. We\nalso provide a parameterized fitting function for the reionization redshift as\na function of halo mass, which could aid in semi-analytical models of galaxy\nformation on cosmological scales. The results indicate that the reionization\nhistory of field galaxies is not correlated with their environment. Therefore,\nwe conclude that Virgo did not have a significant influence on the reionization\nhistory of the Local Group."}
{"text":"\nIn this article, we investigate cosmological parameters, particularly the amplitude and shape of the matter power spectrum, within a standard LambdaCDM model. We combine data from three-dimensional weak gravitational lensing shear field by the COSMOS survey, Ly-alpha forest flux power spectrum from the SDSS and LUQAS, and Cosmic Microwave Background temperature and polarization anisotropies from WMAP. The Ly-alpha forest measurements help reduce the encumbered sigma_8-Omega_m degeneracy encountered when working with the weak lensing data and produces the result of sigma_8 = 0.876 +- 0.048 for COSMOS plus Ly-alpha SDSS data. Consequently, there is a slightly higher result from the WMAP year three CMB data. When we included all three sources of data, the resulting constraints are sigma_8 = 0.800 +- 0.023, n_s = 0.971 +- 0.011, Omega_m = 0.247 +- 0.016 (1-sigma error bars). "}
{"text":"\nWe use next-generation radio and submillimeter telescopes such as the EVLA and ALMA to detect molecular line emission from massive protostellar disks. By running radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of the disks, we determine that the brightness temperatures of the disk core could be up to hundreds of Kelvin, extending over velocity channels of 10 km s-1 and regions of hundreds of AU. Based on our findings, we predict that these observations should be capable of detecting the massive protostellar disks and their rotational curves in nearby star-forming regions. Additionally, we predict that non-axisymmetry and substructure should be detectable, as well as velocity offsets between the stars and disks of several km s^-1, caused by strong gravitational instability. Our simulations aid in exploring the effectiveness of different observation techniques and comparing alternative models of massive star formation."}
{"text":"\nBy leveraging a comprehensive multiwavelength dataset from the radio to X-ray, we have established a comparative analysis of BAL and non-BAL quasars across their Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs). Our Spitzer MIPS observations of 38 BAL quasars, combined with numerous other data from the literature and archives, provide evidence that the optical-to-mid-infrared luminosity ratios of the two populations are similar. Additionally, we measure or limit star formation contribution to the FAR-infrared power. Seven of the 22 upper limits have tight enough constraints to suggest that star formation plays a marginal role in the far-infrared power. Seventeen BAL quasars with detected excess far-infrared radiation likely host hyperluminous starbursts. Bal quasar SEDs based on all the available photometry show no obvious differences when compared to non-BAL quasars. This implies that the typical BAL quasar outburst may not require a ``cocoon'' covering a large swath of the sky and instead reflect a disk-wind scenario that is typical of radio-quiet quasars."}
{"text":"\nThis article reviews evidence of relativistic X-ray emission lines originating from the inner accretion disks surrounding black holes. Recent observations with various space telescopes have revealed these X-ray lines to be a good indicator of the influence of strong gravitational effects. Several noteworthy developments in this field are discussed, including the presence of black hole spin, the detection of relativistic lines in stellar-mass black holes, the effects of gravitational light bending, line flux variability on a timescale of the orbit, and the deduction of the robustness of the relativistic disk lines against absorption, scattering and continuum effects. Moreover, prospects for the improvement of understanding black hole spin as it applies to the co-evolution of black holes and galaxies are explored. The results presented in the article suggest that relativistic X-ray disk lines will be a main driver of future investigations into General Relativity and disk physics."}
{"text":"We conducted low-resolution spectroscopic observations in the 3400-4700 A range of 20 He-weak and 8 He-strong stars to quantify their fundamental parameters using the Divan-Chalonge-Barbier (BCD) spectrophotometric system. Additionally, we evaluated the effective temperatures and angular diameters of a small sample of He-weak stars by computing the absolute fluxes across a wide spectral range. We also executed non-LTE model calculations to assess how the observed ratio of He\/H influences the emergent radiation of He-strong stars and their evaluation of Teff. \n\nWe observe that our BCD-derived figures for effective temperature, surface gravity, and bolometric absolute magnitude matches well with prior estimations based on multiple methods for He-weak stars, whereas for He-strong stars, the BCD values overestimate the true values of Teff. Using model atmospheres with elevated He\/H ratios enables us to explain this overestimation, and further use this method to estimate the He\/H abundance ratio in these stars. We illustrate that the Teff of HD 37479 remains relatively unchanging as its spectrum fluctuates between strong and weak H and He absorption lines. We also present newly acquired data for the He-strong star HD 66765."}
{"text":"\nModelers are increasingly analyzing repulsive gravity by considering theories with negative energy scalar fields and creation. First proposed by Bondi, Gold and Hoyle in 1948, classical steady state cosmology used a negative kinetic energy creation field to yield matter. We demonstrate how central creation is to cosmology, and how it can account for local (z<0.1) and extra-galactic universe observations. To illustrate this, we explore the empirical version of the theory, the quasi-steady state theory that relates creation events to the large-scale dynamics of the universe. Although the theory predicts deceleration in the present universe, it matches recent SNe Ia results (which favor an accelerating universe in conventional cosmology) through a Bayesian data analysis."}
{"text":"\nThis article focuses on the fusion rules of the c_{p,1} series of logarithmic conformal field theories, which are computed by two different approaches. The first approach is an extended version of non-semisimple generalisation of the Verlinde formula. It is used to determine the fusion products with indecomposable representations. The other approach involves the usual Verlinde formula and gets the fusion coefficients in the limit, where the basis of torus amplitudes reduces to the set of characters of irreducible and indecomposable representations. The paper further examines the effect of this linear dependence on the obtained fusion rules and shows that both discussed methods are equivalent. The authors also offer explicit BPZ-like expressions for the obtained fusion rules for all p larger than 2."}
{"text":"In this paper of a series investigating solar-physics applications of the equation-of-state formalism based on Feynman-Kac (FK) representation, the pertinent FK equation of state is introduced and its domain of validity is assessed. Specifically, the FK approach is suitable for physical conditions where more than 90% of helium is ionized, including the interior of the Sun up to about 0.98 of its radius. Though limited, in the regions of the Sun where it applies the FK equation of state is expected to be more accurate than current equations of state used to model the Sun. Specifically, the FK equation of state has the potential to explore physical effects such as Coulomb screening, bound states, recombination of fully-ionized species, and diffraction and exchange effects. The results of this research can be used to inform improved models of the Sun, as well as to develop tighter solar constraints on the equation of state."}
{"text":"\nThis article examines the dynamics of a gas of particles hopping between the nodes of a network in the context of a free zero-range process (FZRP). Three different cases of increasing complexity are discussed. These include FZRP on a rigid geometry, FZRP on a random graph drawn from a given network, and a form of FZRP where the network's topology continuously changes as the process evolves, depending on the particle distribution. The first case examines the intriguing phenomenon of condensation, which appears as a collection of particles on the node presenting the highest degree. The second considers the role of averaging over various graph ensembles, making all nodes identical with respect to the FZRP. In the final case, the distribution of particles and the dynamics of the network are interconnected, with their strength of coupling depending on the ratio of two time-scales, relating to the topology and the FZRP. A particular example is analyzed, demonstrating an interesting phase diagram in the results."}

{"text":"\nThis paper reports the development of a quantum transport simulator for carbon nanoribbon (CNR) field-effect transistors (MOSFETs). The effects of quantum phenomena on the device performance of CNR MOSFETs are explored in the ballistic limit. It is found that the two-dimensional semiconductor contacts in these devices generate metal-induced gap states (MIGS) in the channels, leading to quantum tunneling and electron group level sticking. The observed tunneling current is dominant in the off-state. To assess their potential as ultra-scaled transistors, the authors evaluate the drive currents and the electrostatic control of 1.4nm and 1.8nm CNR MOSFETs with channel lengths of 12.5nm. They find that both devices offer better drive current capabilities and better electrostatic control than Si transistors, but the theoretical 60mV\/dec subthreshold slope is not met as a result of the tunneling currents."}
{"text":"\nA numerical hydrodynamical study was conducted to examine the development and disintegration of isothermal molecular cloud cores. A compressive wave was applied to a sub-Jeans density system of radius 1 pc, producing a shock-bounded spherical shell. The internal shock reached the center and gave rise to a central core comprised of uniform density material, flanked by an envelope with a power-law profile that ultimately flattened to a logarithmic slope of -2 in cases where collapse did not take place. The resulting structure was reminiscent of a quiescent core with a Bonnor-Ebert-like profile. However, unlike conventional BE cores, this core was initially non-self-gravitating, supported by the ram pressure of the supplied material and thus grew in size and mass over time. When the core exceeded the effective Jeans mass, it began to collapse. The findings concur with observations that most pre-stellar cores possess BE-like properties but can vary in mass and may or may not collapse."}
{"text":"\nIn this study, we explored the structural and magnetic characteristics of Ge(1-x)Mn(x) films grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). We discovered that the growth temperature plays a major role in the decomposition of the films, resulting in the formation of vertical one-dimensional nanostructures (nanocolumns) at low temperatures (\u2264120\u00b0C), and Ge3Mn5 clusters at higher temperatures (\u2265180\u00b0C). Our experimental results then demonstrated the presence of at least four different magnetic phases, including paramagnetic diluted Mn atoms, low-Tc nanocolumns (120 K < Tc < 170 K), high-Tc nanocolumns (Tc> 400 K), and Ge3Mn5 clusters, depending on the growth temperature and Mn content. Combining transmission electron microscopy and superconducting quantum interference device magnetometry, we are able to provide a comprehensive analysis of the structure and magnetism of self-organized Ge(1-x)Mn(x) nano-columns."}
{"text":"\nLattice calculations accounting for a mixture of fermion discretization methods present an opportunity to uncover additive mass shift dependencies on the lattice spacing when considering mesons composed of one sea and one valence quark. This mass shift is a crucial factor in hadronic correlation functions given its ability to adjust the pion mass as  a function of lattice spacing. In this article, we analyze the effects of a domain-wall valence fermion and rooted staggered sea fermion lattice action combination on the mass shifts of such mesons. Through the determination of $\\mathcal{O}(a^2)$ and $\\mathcal{O}(a^2 m_\\pi^2)$ corrections, we find that this effect can be described by $\\Delta(am)^2 = 0.034(2) -0.06(2) (a m_\\pi)^2$ in lattice units, or equivalently as $\\Delta(m)^2 = (291\\pm 8 \\textrm{MeV})^2 -0.06(2) m_\\pi^2$ in physical units. The overall shift may be described in effective field theory as $a^2 \\Delta_\\mathrm{Mix} = (316 \\pm 4 \\textrm{MeV})^2$ with next-to-leading order corrections including necessary chiral logarithms for the particular mix of lattice actions. The findings demonstrate that this method of conceptually evaluating the effects of lattice spacing in mixed action calculations can yield precise results."}
{"text":"\nExploring the interplay between radio galaxies and X-ray selected clusters at\nredshifts less than 0.3, this study assesses the fraction of clusters that host\nluminous, central radio sources brighter than 10^(20) W\/Hz\/sr.

{"text":"\nThe self-consistent projection operator method is used to explore the single-particle excitation spectra of the two-dimensional Hubbard model at half filling and zero temperature. By assessing the effects of nonlocal excitations, the obtained spectra validate the accuracy of quantum Monte-Carlo results for finite temperatures. It is found that the Fermi surface in the doping region changes from hole-like to electron-like and the kink structure appears in the quasiparticle energy band due to a mixing between the quasiparticle band and an excitation band with strong short-range antiferromagnetic correlations. The study provides a possible explanation for the anomalous properties observed in the normal state of high-$T_{\\rm c}$ cuprates."}
{"text":"\nThis paper investigates the non-linear dependence of emission-line luminosity of clouds in active galactic nuclei broad-line regions upon ionizing continuum, and how this dependence can be applied while estimating the size of the BLR. To establish this, both numerical cross-correlation and reverberation experiments are conducted with model flares and transfer functions. Additionally, the optical spectral variability of NGC 4151 is modelled to estimate various BLR parameters. Results conclude that cross-correlation estimates of the size of the BLR may be significantly lower than those derived from reverberation modelling. Furthermore, the small size of the BLR determined by the cross-correlation method is suggested as an artefact, meaning that the hypothesis of the BLR's varying size in time is not necessitated by observational data."}

{"text":"\nThis paper seeks to provide an improved view of data streams by discovering maximal frequent patterns in subsets that occur a minimum number of times. With streams potentially being endless, it is challenging to analyze the structure of the stream due to the large number of patterns. Our solution focuses on using clustering to reduce the number of patterns per data stream, as well as determining how frequently patterns co-occur. With clustering, we are able to identify the maximum relevant patterns and determine the distance between each pair. This data is then used to provide the user with an improved overview of the structure of the stream, revealing the most frequent patterns."}
{"text":"\nBy making use of the Big Bear Solar Observatory (BBSO) deep magnetograms and H${\\alpha}$ images, this paper compares the magnetic flux emergence, disappearance and distribution between a quiet region and a coronal hole on September 14 and 16, 2004, respectively. Results reveal that the flux emergence in the form of ephemeral regions in the quiet region is 4.3 times greater than that in the coronal hole, and the flux disappearance in the form of flux cancellation, 2.9 times faster than in the coronal hole. Additionally, more magnetic elements with opposite polarities connected by arch filaments are present in the quiet region. The flux distributions of network and intranetwork elements for both polarities were similar in the quiet region; however, the coronal hole displays a greater proportion of negative flux as the threshold flux density increases. Ultimately, this study concludes that a coronal hole is largely occupied by one single polarity for stronger magnetic fields; whereas, a greater number of fields with the opposite polarity are observed for the weaker fields."}

Further, exact analytical expressions are derived for the self-diffusion coefficients and the stationary solution, from which a boundary-induced phase transition is discovered at a point when the total exterior density gradient between the boundaries is varied. Monte Carlo simulations verify the theoretical results, demonstrating a dependence on the ratio of the two hopping rates, $D_A\/D_B$ at the phase transition line."}
{"text":" The physically sound Hamiltonian formulation of the dynamical Casimir effect introduced by Haro and Elizalde has been revisited here. The complete calculation was provided, giving details of the regularization process which is necessary to obtain meaningful results. It was shown that the motion force derived in this approach contains a reactive term, proportional to the acceleration of the mirrors which is necessary to ensure positive energy particles all the time and satisfaction of conservation laws.  Comparing with other results in the literature, a careful analysis of the interrelations was performed. Although a neutral scalar field in one dimension with one or two partially transmitting mirrors was studied in detail, it is also possible to extend the method to other kinds of fields in two and higher dimensions."}
{"text":"\nWe explored the magnetic flux and temperature changes in a particular coronal hole between the period of October 10th to 14th in 2005 by using the Big Bear Solar Observatory deep magnetogram and the SOHO\/EIT images. We compare the results to the findings in the neighboring quiet region of the sun over the same period. We found that when the coronal hole was strong on October 10th, the positive flux comprised of around 60%, while the EUV brightness was 420 counts pixel$^{-1}$ and the coronal temperature was 1.07 MK. On October 14th, when the coronal hole had nearly faded away, 51% of the positive flux remained, with EUV brightness and temperature rising to 530 counts pixel$^{-1}$ and 1.10 MK respectively. Meanwhile, in the quiet region the fraction of positive flux shifted between 0.49 and 0.47, with EUV brightness meanly at 870 counts pixel$^{-1}$ and temperature almost stable at 1.11 MK. From the results, it appears that a lower imbalance between the flux of opposite polarities within a coronal hole leads to stronger EUV brightness and higher coronal temperature."}
{"text":"\nLarge social networks are increasingly becoming easier to analyze due to advances in computing technology, providing opportunities for the discovery of new insights within these datasets. NodeTrix is a hybrid visual representation for social networks that combines the advantages of node-link diagrams and adjacency matrices. This facilitates a more thorough exploration of global network structures and local community communities. Interaction techniques are introduced allowing a node-link or matrix selection to create a NodeTrix visualization, which can then be flexibly manipulated to uncover new relationships. We conducted a case study using the InfoVis 2004 co-authorship dataset to illustrate the power of NodeTrix as both an exploration tool and a way to effectively communicate data findings."}
{"text":"\nThis study explores the existence of the floating phase (which has an infinite correlation length and an algebraic decay of spin-spin correlations) within the temperature $(T)$ - frustration parameter ($\\kappa$) phase diagram of a 2D ANNNI model. To characterize this phase, we analyze various physical quantities - energy, magnetization, layer magnetization, length of domain walls along the direction of frustration, number of domain-intercepts (along the direction of frustration) and number of domain walls that do not touch the upper and\/or lower boundary - of the model across a range of $\\kappa$ values. We find that the low temperature phase is ferromagnetic when $\\kappa < 0.5$ and antiphase when $\\kappa > 0.5$. Our results show that the floating phase, if it exists at all, is likely to be limited to a particular line in the $\\kappa$ - $T$ phase diagram. This is in accordance with prior studies."}
{"text":"\nThis article presents a novel risk assessment technique for intersections based on a combination of a highly non-linear processing model and an information encoding procedure. The technique encodes all static and dynamic elements of the road intersection scene into a directed positional acyclic labeled graph and then reformulates the risk assessment problem into an inductive learning task. To solve this task, a recursive neural network is used, which possesses the ability to process supervised or unsupervised learning problems represented by directed order acyclic graphs. This novel approach offers an alternative to current risk assessment techniques as it can learn the structure of the risk while allowing for advanced intersection safety systems. Test scenarios demonstrate the potential of this technique."}
{"text":"This article introduces a method to generate a Poincar\\'e series associated with a toric or analytically irreducible quasi-ordinary hypersurface singularity, (S,0). This series is created by a finite sequence of monomial valuations which at least one must be disposed at the origin 0. We demonstrate that this Poincar\\'e series is a rational function with integer coefficients, which can also be characterized by an integral with respect to the Euler characteristic and the projectivization of the analytic algebra of the singularity. Eventually, we also show how this series associated to the set of divisorial valuations associated to the essential divisors provides an analytic invariant of the singularity, specifically in the quasi-ordinary hypersurface case. This can be further characterized by the normalized sequence of characteristic monomials, which is a complete invariant of the embeded topological type of the hypersurface singularity."}
{"text":"\nThe major solar event of 2006 December 13, characterized by a series of\nhot ejecta, a sizeable two-ribbon flare, and a wide Earth-directed coronal\nmass ejection, is linked to the evolution of the magnetic field and sunspot\nin the source region of active region NOAA AR 10930 as it passed the center of\nthe solar disk from December 10 to 13. Interaction between a rapidly spinning\nsunspot and ephemeral regions in the vicinity of the active region's magnetic\nneutral line set off a series of brightenings that led ultimately to the large\nflare event. We propose that this sunspot must have rotated at least a 200$^{\\circ}$\nbefore the flare could take place, the greatest sunspot roataion angle reported\nto date."}
{"text":"This paper explores how European eLearning users perceive their privacy when accessing eLearning services. First, various terms and legal aspects relevant to this issue are presented. Then, a survey is conducted to gain further insight on the matter. The result of the survey will be evaluated in order to determine the attitude of eLearning users towards their privacy when utilizing these services. It will be revealed that, although there is considerable concern for protection of personal information, users are more likely to accommodate existing requirements than to take additional steps for their privacy protection. Lastly, the paper proposes approaches to help users reconcile their concerns with their actual actions in regards to privacy."}
{"text":"\nThis article investigates how the addition of new scalar fields and interactions to the Standard Model impacts the predicted physics of the Weinberg-Salam theory, particularly the Electroweak phase transition. To this end, utilizing the Dolan-Jackiw method, finite temperature corrections are calculated and the phase transition found to be of first order. Additionally, the interaction of these new scalar fields strengthens the stability of the Z string of the Electroweak phase transition through the ``bag'' phenomenon first described by Watkins and Vachaspati. Furthermore, a 'gravitational' effect of non-propagating torsion on the mass of the fermions is proposed, as well as a check to make sure that the field generating the Majorana mass for the $\\nu_R$ is non-zero in the physical vacuum. All of this research could hold relevance with regards to the recent interest of study in cosmic strings."}
{"text":"\nWe explore the effects of the QCD anomaly on the two-flavor QCD chiral phase transition by using strongly coupled lattice QED with two flavors of massless staggered fermions. This model has the right chiral symmetries and can be studied efficiently with cluster algorithms. Our investigation confirms the accepted notion that the chiral phase transition is first order without the anomaly, while the anomaly weakens it and turns it second order at a critical strength. The anomaly strength at the tricritical point is determined by measuring the ratio $(M_{\\eta'}-M_{\\pi})\/\\rho_{\\eta'}$, where $M_{\\eta'}, M_{\\pi}$ indicate the screening masses of the anomalous and regular pions and $\\rho_{\\eta'}$ denotes the mass-scale that characterizes the low energy fluctuations of the anomalous symmetry. Our results indicate that a robust anomaly is needed for the two-flavor QCD chiral phase transition to become second order, i.e. $r \\sim 7$."}
{"text":"In this study, the Black Hole Mass-Spheroid Luminosity relation is investigated by evaluating the differences in the M_bh-Luminosity relations proposed by McLure & Dunlop, Marconi & Hunt and Erwin et al. Variance in these equations due to factors such as dust attenuation, the inclusion of lenticular galaxies and the same (Y|X) regressional analysis are appraised. Adjustments made, ultimately produce a relation that yields consistent black hole masses. Analysis of K, B and R-bands yields corresponding M_bh-L relations. Discussion of the implications for dry mergers, intermediate mass black holes and a potential sample selection bias follow. An expression for correction is provided in order to rectify the bias."}
{"text":"\nBy examining 11 S0 galaxies at z < 0.006 with NTT\/EMMI long-slit spectroscopic observations, we have studied the globular cluster specific frequency S_N as a diagnostic to determine evidence for the formation of S0 galaxies from spirals whose star formation has been halted. Through the use of single-stellar population models, we find that galaxies with higher S_N have older stellar populations, which supports the notion that spirals are fading into lenticular galaxies due to a decrease in their star formation rate. Evidence from the five galaxies which feature detectable emission lines suggests that the process of star formation quenching takes no longer than 1 gigayear. Our findings provide insight into the development of S0 galaxies and show that the truncation of star formation is a relatively gentle process."}
{"text":"\nWe investigated archival XMM-Newton soft X-ray spectral data from the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 4151, revealing numerous emission lines and radiative recombination continua from hydrogen-like and helium-like oxygen, nitrogen, neon and carbon. A two-component photoionization model with high column density (10e23 cm-2) and low covering factor could generally reproduce the Lyman series lines; however, it was inadequate to match He-like triplets seen in the data. Resorting to a third component of lower column density (10e20.5 cm-2) with non-zero microturbulence and high covering factor enabled us to fit the observed spectrum. Some anomalies remain however; our model is not an ideal match to the profiles of the lines. Comparison of our three emission components to those from a study of NGC 4151 absorption spectra by Kraemer et al. (2005) revealed similarities between two components of our own."}
{"text":"\nSimulation studies of a colloidal system of spheres interacting with a deep and narrow attractive potential and a shallow long-ranged barrier have uncovered a prepeak in the static structure factor, suggesting the presence of a mesoscopic length scale of clusters and\/or voids. Our analysis using mode coupling theory, without adjustable parameters and taking all input directly from simulations, reveals the mechanism of glassy arrest at 40% packing fraction of the system. We found that the local formation of physical bonds determines the slowing down that causes arrest, suggesting an important role of the low-q peak in the glassy transition. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that the lifetime of the mesoscopic structure (voids) is overestimated by mode-coupling theory, remaining largely unaffected by large-scale heterogeneities and setting the clock for the slow cluster mode."}
{"text":"\nWe present the results of a wide-field survey of the W3 giant molecular cloud and star-forming region in the 850-micron continuum, using the SCUBA bolometer array on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope. Our findings indicate an increase in the fraction of total gas mass in dense structures traced by 850-micron emission when compared to the unaffected cloud, being 5-13% versus 25-37%. This suggests a connection between the surrounding HII region and stellar winds from the nearby W4 association, and any resulting triggered star formation. We additionally find significant structure in the clump mass distribution, likely due to the confounding influence of resolution, rather than a simple single-power law. The index of the high-mass end remains unaffected by the interaction."}
{"text":"A new spectral method is proposed to meet the challenge of coupling exterior and interior solutions of elliptic problems. The proposed approach is validated on two-dimensional Poisson and Laplace problems, where the continuity of solutions and their normal derivatives across the interface are required. Chebyshev approximations are used to describe both the interior solutions and the boundary values, and a preprocessing step calculates the homogenous solutions for the exterior and interior domains which serve to form the influence matrix. Properties of Chebyshev approximations ensure uniform representation of exterior harmonic functions. Application of the method to calculate the electrostatic potential due to rectangular charge distributions yields a well-conditioned influence matrix and solutions that converge rapidly. The extension of this approach to three-dimensional problems, such as magnetohydrodynamic equations in a finite cylindrical domain surrounded by a vacuum is explored."}
{"text":"\nA new approach to build the supersymmetric Standard Model is presented with the use of four intersecting stacks of fractional branes on the Z_6' orientifold. These stacks of branes yield the matter spectrum of the Standard Model with two Higgs doublets. The gauge group for the model is identified as SU(3)_{colour} x SU(2)_L x U(1)_Y x U(1)_H, where the Higgs is charged under U(1)_H. To obtain the desired Standard Model spectrum, the numbers of intersections between each brane stack and its mirror must satisfy (a \\cap b,a \\cap b')=(2,1) or (1,2), with no matter in symmetric representations of the gauge group, and a limited amount of matter in antisymmetric representations.

{"text":"\nThis paper presents the SFI++ dataset, which is a catalog of homogenously derived photometric and rotational properties and Tully-Fisher distances as well as peculiar velocities. We use digital optical images, long-slit spectra, and HI line profiles in order to gain parameters that are relevant to disk scaling relations. Furthermore, our sample includes previously published data sets in addition to a new sample of 2000 objects. To assign galaxies to groups or clusters and reduce the scatter caused by local orbital motions, both the percolation algorithm and the Voronoi-Delaunay method have been employed. Corrections towards peculiar velocities have been made in regard to both homogeneous and inhomogeneous Malmquist bias, with the density field of the 2MASS Redshift Survey acquainting this process. In conclusion, the final SFI++ catalog includes 4861 field and cluster galaxies, allowing the study of detailed local velocity fields as well as global flows. "}
{"text":"\nThe formation of interface dipoles at the interfaces between self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of --CH$_3$ and --CF$_3$ terminated short-chain alkanethiolates on Ag(111) is investigated using density functional theory calculation. To analyze the change in the surface work function upon adsorption of the SAM, the structures are assessed in packing densities of $(\\sqrt{7}\\times\\sqrt{7}) R19.1^{\\circ}$, $(\\sqrt{3}\\times\\sqrt{3}) R30^{\\circ}$, and {p(2$\\times$2)}. The results demonstrate that the work function of alkanethiolate SAMs on silver is only minimally influenced by the packing density; however, the work function of fluorinated alkanethiolates displays a stronger dependence. By examining these results, it is seen that the interface dipole is made up of two individual contributions - one that is derived from the molecular dipole and the other from the charge transfer between the metal surface and the molecules. Despite being impacted by the silver-sulfur bond, the charge transfer stays independent of the electronegativity of the molecules."}
{"text":"\nThis study investigates the nanoscopic structure and velocity of (1+1)-dimensional solid-on-solid interfaces, subject to an Ising lattice-gas model and driven from equilibrium via an applied force, such as a magnetic field or difference in electrochemical potential. Through analytic nonlinear-response approximation and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, the system is coupled to a two-dimensional phonon bath, in which the energy of the system is conserved, the outcomes of the applied force and interaction energies are not factorized (known as a 'hard dynamic'). Results demonstrate that the local interface width changes drastically with the driving force, albeit being nonmonotonic. Comparisons between theory and simulation reveals that near two particular values of the force, transitions allowed by the solid-on-solid model become forbidden in the phonon-assisted dynamic. Ultimately, these findings enhance our understanding of kinetic Monte Carlo simulations."}
{"text":"\nThis paper investigates the Kalman - Yakubovich - Popov (KYP) inequality for contractive operator matrices for passive discrete-time systems. Different forms of the KYP inequality are defined and properties of solutions are studied. We look further into situations where a minimal solution satisfies a corresponding Riccati equation and can be obtained iteratively with a specified initial point. The Krein shorted operator is employed to obtain a necessary condition and some sufficient conditions for the uniqueness of the solution."}
{"text":"\nWe conducted neutron powder diffraction measurements and heat capacity experiments on zinc paratacamite Zn$_x$Cu$_{4-x}$(OH)$_6$Cl$_2$ with $x=1$, and discovered it to be an exceptional realization of the $S=1\/2$ kagom\u00e9 antiferromagnet. We identified a mix of Cu$^{2+}$\/Zn$^{2+}$ at the Cu and Zn sites - roughly 9% of all Cu$^{2+}$ for $x=1$ - which explained the field dependence of the heat capacity. From our determination of the Cu$^{2+}$ occupancy of the Zn sites for $x=0.8...1$ and the magnetic susceptibility data, we propose that zinc paratacamite is not a spin gap system at this concentration range. Its macroscopically degenerate ground state and glassy dynamics as a function of decreasing concentrations suggest that it has no magnetic ordering."}
{"text":"\nThe Hamiltonian approach to uniting the General Relativity and the Standard Model is explored in this article, assessing its ability to satisfy Newton's law, the Higgs effect, cosmological evolution, and the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation. A variation of the Higgs potential is proposed, in which the constant parameter is substituted with a dynamic Fourier harmonic of the Higgs field. This model predicts a mass for the Higgs field, and removes the significant vacuum cosmological density. Moreover, it is found that the General Relativity principles clearly demonstrate that the Planck epoch closely resembles the present-day epoch. Additionally, the article provides evidence that the Universe's fundamental particles originated from the decay of primordial Higgs particles and W-Z vector bosons formed directly from the vacuum at the Big Bang."}
{"text":"\n\nIn this paper, Mobasher et al. (2005) used data from Spitzer Infra-red Spectrograph (IRS) Peak-Up Imaging of the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS) to observe HUDF-JD2, which is a very faint galaxy at all wavelengths shorter than 1.1 microns visible by Hubble. The spectral energy distribution of this galaxy exhibited a fourfold increase in its flux density between 16 microns and 22 microns, extensively due to the emergence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission features into the 22 microns and 24 microns passband. Fitting the ratio of both bandpasses revealed that HUDF-JD2 was a z~2 luminous infrared galaxy with a stellar mass of >10^10 M_sun, and a bolometric luminosity of (2-6)\u00d7 10^{11} L_sun corresponding to a star-formation rate of 80 M_sun\/yr. Despite the optical\/near-infrared photometry which still affirms photometric redshift solutions of z>6, the authors argue that the consistency of this galaxy with other dusty starbursts point towards the z~2 mid-infrared photometric redshift. This work offers evidence of optically unseen near-infrared sources being detected as dusty starbursts at z~2, and can be observed in lensed submillimeter surveys."}

{"text":"\nThis study demonstrated the capacity of the synthetic data generator SynTReN to validate and compare algorithms for learning expression module networks. We proposed a new software, titled LeMoNe, for module network learning that utilizes a bottom-up Bayesian hierarchical clustering process to build regulatory programs, and a conditional entropy measure to assign regulators to program nodes. Testing with simulated data sets enabled us to assess the potentials of Genomica and LeMoNe and the effects of various parameters, like dataset size and noise, on their performance. Despite some discrepancies, both algorithms generated similar outcomes and LeMoNe is significantly faster with large datasets. Further, we showed that the regulation program inferring regulators through LeMoNe's conditional entropy metric could be used to prioritize regulators for further validational tests and that the combination of the clustering strategy and the entropy-based assignment method is effective in identifying missing or hidden regulators."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate the structure of s-wave interacting two-component Fermi gases\nsubject to a harmonic trapping potential, in the context of the BEC-BCS\ncrossover regime. Two distinct approaches are used to solve the\nSchrodinger equation for systems with up to N=20 fermions.

{"text":"\nIn this article, we explore the entanglement conditions in a Jaynes-Cummings Model, composed of two atoms and two photon modes in a vacuum. By extending the current findings, we have established that the entanglement strength is a periodic function of time. We have demonstrated that our results are consistent with the prevailing entanglement conditions, even when arbitrary values of the atomic energies and photon mode frequencies are assumed. Our findings constitute the first study of the resonant and nonresonant conditions of the two atom, two photon system and the outcome of the model is a general equation valid for both cases. Additionally, we have deduced that periodicity of entanglement is an exclusive characteristic of a resonant system. Furthermore, we have established an approach for a more exhaustive analysis of the two-atom, two-photon system, as well as for many-atom systems in general, by deriving associated master equations."}
{"text":"\nThis study explores the potential of elliptic, hybrid models of galactic gravitational lensing that combine a universal dark matter density profile with a Sersic profile for the baryonic matter distribution. To this end, analytic forms for the lens potentials of these models are derived, and a recipe for elliptic symmetry in either the projected mass or lens potential is developed. Additionally formulae describing the gravitational lensing effects of differently truncated universal cold dark matter are provided and taken compared to the infinite-mass NFW profile. Furthermore, the application of these models to stripped halo profiles and their implications for cosmological ray-tracing simulations and investigating catastrophic lensing effects are discussed."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate the radio luminosities of solitary versus binary millisecond pulsars through observations of PSR J1453+1902, a 5.79-ms pulsar from a 430-MHz drift-scan survey with the Arecibo telescope. The observations confirm this object is isolated, with a proper motion of 8(2) mas\/yr and a nominal distance of 1.2 kpc. Evaluating a current sample of 55 pulsars in the Galactic disk, we examine whether the luminosities of isolated millisecond pulsars differ from their companions. By examining survey samples from 430-MHz and 1400-MHz, we see no distinction in the luminosity distributions, implying a single homogeneous population. Therefore, our results suggest that the spin, kinematic, spatial and luminosity distributions of isolated and binary millisecond pulsars are drawn from the same source."}

We further show that the $DY_q^{\\infty}(sl_2)$-modules are $V_q$-modules-at-infinity. Using the theory of $\\S$-local and quasi-local subsets, we establish a connection between the Lie algebra of pseudo-differential operators on the circle and vertex algebras through quasi modules-at-infinity."}

These four detectors - ALLEGRO, AURIGA, EXPLORER and NAUTILUS - had improved sensitivities over IGEC 1997-2000 observations, due to enhanced duty cycles and wider bandwidths. The data analysis focused on threefold observation to ensure a strong statistical confidence if a candidate of gravitational waves were to be found. A false detection rate of 1 per century was achieved, yet no candidate events were located."}
{"text":"\nThis paper presents a theoretical approach for studying the dynamic properties of molecular motors driven by an active interaction with molecular tracks. Discrete-state stochastic ``burnt-bridge'' models are utilized to study the diffusion of particles along a one-dimensional lattice with weak links at regular intervals. The weak links are destroyed (``burned'') with a probability p, allowing for a bias to be introduced in the motion of the molecular motor. Through exact calculations, the paper demonstrates that the dispersion of motor proteins is a decreasing function of the concentration of bridges, with a more intricate relationship to the burning probability. Additionally, the results show a gap in dispersion at very low weak link concentrations, indicating a dynamic phase transition between unbiased and biased diffusion regimes. To back up these theoretical findings, Monte Carlo computer simulations are conducted."}
{"text":"\nThis work examines the twist-2 and twist-3 light-cone distribution amplitudes of $1^3P_1$ and $1^1P_1$ axial-vector mesons, by using a QCD conformal partial wave expansion. In accordance with the equations of motion, the twist-3 two-parton light-cone amplitudes can be converted to leading-twist and twist-3 three-parton light-cone amplitudes. Then, the corresponding G-parity violating and invariant parameters, including the effects of SU(3) breaking, are calculating according to the QCD sum rule methodology. Moreover, the values of the tensor decay constants and Gegenbauer moments of leading-twist distribution are renewed for $1^1P_1$ states. The formula of Gell-Mann-Okubo implies that the mixing angle between $f_8$ and $f_1$ of $1^3P_1$ mesons is approximately $38^\\circ$, and that for $h_8$ and $h_1$ of $1^1P_1$ charged mesons is around $10^\\circ$. As for physical states $f_1(1285), f_1(1420), h_1(1170)$, and $h_1(1380)$, a detailed description is provided. In addition, if the mixing angle for $K_{1A}$ and $K_{1B}$ is taken to be $\\theta_K=45^\\circ$ or $-45^\\circ$, then the properties of $K_1(1270)$ and $K_1(1400)$ can be further buttressed. The resultant distribution amplitudes, with components up to conformal spin 9\/2, suggest an asymmetric pattern which could be mutually beneficial to both theory and experimentation."}
{"text":"\nThrough the use of VLA and VLBA observations of SiO masers, the KaLYPSO project is exploring the structures and dynamical evolution of high-mass YSOs (Radio Source I) over a distance of 10-100 AU, providing insight into the launching sites of outflows from accretion disks. Tracking proper motions of individual SiO maser spots over the multiple-year span of observations, the KaLYPSO project will generate 3D maps of the outflow structure over a substantial portion of the outflow crossing time. Results thus far suggest that high-mass star formation is driven by disk-mediated accretion, rather than the simpler effects proposed by past theories."}
{"text":"\nWe present analysis of the optical and mid-infrared spectrophotometric evolution of V1186 Scorpii, a classical nova, during the first year of its outburst. Initial spectra taken shortly after its visible peak show typical CO-type nova features with strong hydrogen, iron, oxygen, and helium emission and a complex light curve behavior akin to PW Vul. Determination of the intrinsic characteristics based on t$_2$ is made difficult due to the instability of the light curve, and no plausible distance can be found from the MMRD relationship. Further examination of the spectra from 260 to 380 days after the outburst peak reveals transition into a nebular spectrum, with considerable weakening of hydrogen emission and the emergence of Ne II (12.81 $\\mu$m) and Ne III (15.56 $\\mu$m) being the strongest lines. Modelling of the photoionization process confirms annealing of a low temperature source and low levels of neon enhancement, contradicting the typical result that classical novae like V1186 Sco occur on ONeMg white dwarfs. This study is of unique significance as strong Ne II lines rarely appear so early during the outburst of a CO nova; further implying that the emissions in the mid-infrared are not only indicative of ONeMg nova events."}
{"text":"\nThis high-resolution X-ray imaging study of the stellar population in the Galactic massive star-forming region RCW49 and its central OB association Westerlund 2, obtained with the Chandra X-ray Observatory and the Infrared Survey Facility, has yielded a number of insights about the region. We were successful in resolving Westerlund 2 for the first time in X-ray and found over eighty percent of the X-ray sources with optical or infrared identifications to be cluster members. We further estimated a 2-5 kpc distance for RCW49 from the mean X-ray luminosities of T Tauri stars, identified 30 new OB star candidates, estimated a 6-7' cluster radius based on the X-ray surface number density profiles, and found 90% of the cluster members to be individually identified using X-ray and MIR excess emission. The five brightest X-ray sources, two Wolf-Rayet stars and three O stars, showed hard thermal spectra."}
{"text":"\nThe present article examines the production of a sterile species by means of an effective active-sterile neutrino mixing in an environment at thermal equilibrium. To this end, two distinct methods - the effective action and the quantum master equation - are implemented in order to obtain the quantum kinetic equations for the coherences and distribution functions. It is shown that the evolution of the distribution functions is dictated by two different time scales, $\\Gamma_1$ and $\\Gamma_2$, associated with the dampening rates of the quasiparticle modes in the medium -  with $\\Gamma_{aa}$ denoting the interaction rate of the active species in the absence of mixing and $\\tm$ as the mixing angle in the medium. The decoherence time is thus established to be $\\tau_{dec} = 2\/\\Gamma_{aa}$. As a conclusion, a generalization of the active-sterile transition probability in a medium is yielded when passing through the quantum master equation approach and an examination of the quantum kinetic equations by introduction of the ``polarization vector'' is likewise provided."}
{"text":"\nBy studying CIV absorption systems in 3 GRB afterglow spectra, we found that the number density of strong intervening (0.5<z<2) CIV absorbers was not statistically different than that of QSO spectra. This result is different than what was found in Prochter et al. 2006, which showed there was nearly 4 times more strong MgII absorbers detected in GRB afterglow spectra than in QSO spectra. We discuss a few possible explanations for why the results differ between MgII and CIV absorbers, including the possibility of a higher dust extinction in the MgII QSO sample studied thus far. Our results indicate that GRBs can provide alternative ways to understand the evolution of the universe, and uncover details that were not accessible before."}

As a result of the {}^{(d)}T transformation properties of the matter fields, the model dynamically generates a mass hierarchy between the b and t quarks. There are nine operators in the Yukawa sector, enabled by a Z_{12} x Z'_{12} symmetry which also suppresses, up to some high orders, operators leading to proton decay. In total, the model contains nine parameters making it highly predictive.

{"text":"\nWe present two new zero-variance zero-bias quantum Monte Carlo estimators for calculating the spherically- and system-averaged electron pair density (i.e. the probability of finding two electrons separated by a relative distance u). This technique, proposed by Assaraf and Caffarel, replaces the average of the local delta-function operator with an average of a smooth non-local operator, thereby significantly reducing both the variance and bias of the intracule density. As a result, simultaneous optimization of more parameters in Jastrow-Slater trial wave functions can yield high-accuracy intracule densities for a variety of atoms and molecules. The same principles apply to any pair-correlation function in a Monte Carlo calculation."}
{"text":"\nAn analysis of data from eight nearby Type Ia supernovae that have been observed in detail reveals that their B-band light-curve rise times can be described, upon correction for light-curve decline rate, by two distinct modes - 18.81 +- 0.36 days and 16.64 +- 0.21 days. The findings of this newly developed template-building algorithm, based on smoothly varying, bias-free light-curve functions, suggest that when comparing SN luminosity at different redshifts in order to determine cosmological parameters, an unrealistic rise time in the light-curve template can introduce a bias of 0.03 magnitudes - approximately two days shorter than two published averages based on small samples."}
{"text":"This paper examines the exact solutions for nonholonomic Ricci flows, which involve the constraints of nonintegrability. We introduce two distinct geometric methods for deriving such solutions, both of which rely on Einstein's equations with anisotropic cosmological constants. The first method applies the nonholonomic frame deformation equations to express the gravitational evolution and field equations as a set of nonlinear partial differential equations. The second approach provides a general scheme wherein a two-parameter family of solutions is created through source-free solutions of Einstein's equations with one or two Killing vector fields. Iteration of these solutions results in an infinite number of parameters defining non-Abelian groups, and nonlinear superpositions of some of the classes of solutions can be used to construct extended integral varieties of the Ricci flow and Einstein equations."}
{"text":"\nIn this article, we analyze Ricci flows of different classes of solutions from Einstein's and string gravity. The anholonomic frame technique is employed for a generic off-diagonal metric ansatz and the corresponding field equation gets converted into a totally integrable system of partial differential equations. These solutions are dependent on arbitrary generation and integration functions of one, two or three variables. With the incorporation of certain nonholonomic frame restraints, it is possible to devise vacuum, Einstein and even string (with antisymmetric torsion field) metric models. This technique, which takes its roots in Lagrangian and Finsler geometries but is redefined for semi-Riemannian spaces, is useful in developing new classes of exact solutions with the help of nonholonomic parametric deformations based on generalized Geroch transforms and Ricci flow evolutions. With this in mind, we explicitly construct a selection of particular solutions involving multi-parameter Einstein spaces and nontrivial Ricci flows, describing evolutions and interactions of solitonic pp-waves and new variants of the Schwarzschild metric. We analyze the associated physical effects and speculate on their relevance in contemporary gravity studies."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate the temperature characteristics of an interface between a cuprous oxide quantum well and DCM2:CA:PS organic compound. By leveraging \"solvatochromism\" to resonate the Frenkel molecular exciton of the DCM2 with the $1S$ quadrupole Wannier-Mott exciton of the cuprous oxide, we create a thermally-dependent hybrid system. Cooling the hybrid via a surrounding helium bath leads to a steeply non-linear temperature dependence of the laser field detuning from the quadrupole exciton energy band. We discovered \\emph{multiple} bi-stability regions with detuning hysteresis, which possess a magnitude at least three times higher ($meV$) than in bulk cuprous oxide ($\\mu eV$). The associated effective absorption curve of the hybrid features an asymmetrical separation between the Frenkel-like and Wannier-like branches."}

{"text":"\nThis article outlines the optimization of a modern, prismatic drive which has the capability to transmute turning movement into a sliding motion, or vice versa. It  replaces the existing ball screws in the Orthoglide, a three-DOF parallel robot which operates translational motions in machining applications at Ecole Centrale de Nantes.  The design is based on the cam mechanism Slide-o-Cam with rollers mounted on a conveyed follower and offers an attractive alternative to linear drives, as it creates pure rolling motion thereby reducing friction. The success of the mechanism is reflected in its pressure angle, which plays a vital role in measuring the amount of power passed into both the load and the machine frame. The Hertz formula is implemented to calculate the strain on the cams and rollers, which consequently allows for the optimization of the drive for its intended purposes."}
{"text":"Using numerical simulations of star clusters with and without primitive binaries, this study presents an analysis of the structural parameters of star clusters which is directly comparable to Galactic globular clusters. The results of this analysis suggest that the majority of observed star clusters do not require the presence of an intermediate-mass black hole to explain the core to half-light radius ratio, and that a black hole binary may be an alternative mechanism. However, this study does not fully exclude potential intermediate-mass black hole presence in star clusters."}
{"text":"\nWe examine transcritical bifurcations that occur in two-dimensional, non-integrable Hamiltonian systems. We present a mathematical description of these bifurcations, using a method used in symplectic mappings. Building on this, we conduct numerical tests where we analyze the stability and unfolding of these bifurcations under various perturbations of the Hamiltonians. Additionally, we strengthen the description by demonstrating that for a Hamiltonian featuring librating orbits, transcritical bifurcations are the more common occurrence, even without any discrete symmetry, while isochronous pitchfork bifurcations are the rare exception. We then apply a model to obtain the normal forms of these bifurcations, as well as a uniform approximation which allows us to include transcritical bifurcations in trace formulae for calculating quantum densities. We utilize this method to generate and compare coarse-grained quantum densities and semiclassical results, and find them to have excellent agreement."}
{"text":"This paper examines the equivalency problem concerning three-dimensional spacetimes. We provide a workable, coordinate-invariant approach to delineate the local structure of a given space. Our approach is based on Karlhede's invariant characterization of spacetime, the curvature tensor, and the Cotton-York spinors; the algebraic classification of these elements being integral to the formulation. We discuss a particular type of spacetime, Goedel-type, in the context of three-dimensional General Relativity, with the view of determining homogeneity in both space and time. These results are then contrasted with similar studies of four-dimensional Goedel-type spacetimes."}
{"text":"\nThis paper studies the utilization of max-product belief propagation to obtain the highest weight matching in any type of graph, with associated weights. First, a probability distribution is contrived such that its mode is the desired optimum matching. After this, max-product is employed. The weighted matching can also be modeled as an integer program with a relaxation called LP. It is not always so tight. We examine this discrepancy between max-product function and LP relaxation in detail and are able to demonstrate that: 1) max-product returns a precise outcome when LP relaxation is exact; 2) max-product does not converge when LP relaxation is loose. These findings provide a dependable and exact description of max-product piece of work and link it explicitly to LP relaxation, a quantified optimization system that is widely studied. Our conclusions go further than prior findings concerning max-product compliant weighted matchings in bipartite graphs."}
{"text":"\nThe emergence of optical frequency combs has enabled the application of laboratory-based precision laser spectroscopy in astronomy. These combs consist of a broad range of equally-spaced, highly uniform intensity lines, allowing for absolute frequency accuracies of 10e-12 per day. The new method of calibration is being explored as a possible solution to challenges posed by current calibration techniques in spectrometry, such as the limited spectral range and strong intensity variation of light emitted from HeAr and ThAr lamps as well as difficulty in achieving uniform illumination from integrating spheres. This technology holds the potential for the reliable operation of next generation astronomic spectrometers capable of broad-band, highly accurate, and reproducible calibration."}
{"text":"This article explores a computational approach to uncovering symmetries in differential geometry arising from conformal Killing tensors (CKT). Specifically, the aim of this research is to develop a systematic approach to reduce the number of components required to solve overdetermined systems of differential equations within the CKT framework. Through a decomposition of the section bundles, a structure is developed which generates a tree in which each row represents a higher derivative. With the use of the conformal Killing equation, a finite number of independent jets is found which express any first or second order covariant derivatives. The outcome of the proposed method is a heightened discovery of symmetry operators at first and second degree, as well as revealing the first order symmetry operators of the Yamabe case. Additionally, the discovery of these processes has led to further conjectures about the second order symmetry operators of the Yamabe operator."}

The accretion rate of the supermassive black hole Sgr A* is\nregulated by a low number of stars with winds' velocities below 750 km\/s and may vary over time.

{"text":"\nThis article examines the relationship between classical and quantum phase transitions and the conditions necessary for discontinuous behavior through the use of the self-consistent Fermi Golden Rule. In this context, a quantum two-level system in the presence of an environment may demonstrably experience a quantum dynamical phase transition, yielding a transition from oscillatory dynamics to a non-oscillatory phase. As put forth, this requires evaluation of both a classical and a quantum thermodynamic limit. Additionally, this shift underlines the need to further public intuition and understanding of the transition from static to dynamic friction. This work is supported by the Generalized Landauer-Buettiker Equations \u2013 a simplification of the Keldysh formalism \u2013, Wigner functions, Loschmidt echo, mesoscopic echo, spin dynamics, solid state NMR and Liquid Crystal NMR.

A novel approach to the treatment of boundary conditions is proposed, namely the double polytrope model, which consists of a polytropic index 'n' less than 5 in the main body paired with a higher index 'n' in an outer atmosphere extending to infinity. Results of the inquiry include confirming the relation between mass and radius, as well as an upper limit on the mass of these idealized stars. Ultimately, the work finds that all static configurations are stable."}

Furthermore, this research also validates that partitioning the database into sub-blocks and directly using GRK to locate the target sub-block proves to be more efficient than searching for it in multiple steps."}
{"text":"\nThe non-equilibrium dynamics of many natural systems, such as glasses, interfaces, and fractures, often exhibit unique behaviour resulting from memory effects, ageing, and complex nonlinear dynamics. In this article, we focus on a curious system that lies between a glass and a crystal: a Bragg glass of vortices in a superconductor. We discover that when a force is applied to the system, the response obeys a stretched exponential law with an exponent that indicates the deviation from equilibrium. We also observe that, when the force is removed, the system ages with time and its response is subject to simple ageing, meaning that older systems respond more slowly than younger ones. We show that simple ageing is likely to occur when there is enough quenched disorder present. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the hierarchical arrangement of timescales caused by loose vortices unable to move before the trapped ones, leads to the stretched exponential response."}
{"text":"\n\nThis work utilizes chemodynamical simulations to explore the effect of massive star winds on the early growth of globular clusters (GCs). It is found that high-density, compact stellar systems emerge from GMCs that are influenced by the physical processes of star formation and by the tidal fields of their host halos. Stellar winds from massive stars that contaminate GC-forming GMCs are responsible for light elements, such as C, N, and O to exhibit star-to-star inhomogeneities in GCs. Our simulations that employed a standard initial mass function (IMF) present a C-N anticorrelation, where stars with smaller [C\/Fe] have higher [N\/Fe] ratios in the associated clusters. The discrepancy between the numerical models and core GC observations that indicate the presence of N-rich stars (e.g., NGC 6752) with [N\/Fe] above 0.8 is pondered in light of the 'bimodal star formation scenario' that suggests that massive star formation occurred before lower-mass star formation in GC-forming GMCs. Additionally, our model includes stars of almost normal He abundances (Y ~ 0.24) with some star population approximating Y ~ 0.3 in certain cases; however, the corresponding number fraction of He-rich stars is identified to be small (\u223c10^-3)."}
{"text":"\nWe conducted spectroscopic observations on 11 clusters in the Red-Sequence Cluster Survey at moderate redshifts (z=0.7-1.0). We found a close correspondence between the estimated redshifts based on the color of the red-sequence, and the spectroscopically-obtained redshifts, with only 10% scatter. In two of the clusters, we identified pairs of comparable clusters projecting close enough to appear as a single object from the survey. When examining a subset of clusters with sufficient spectroscopic members, the correlation between optical richness and dynamical mass was consistent with what is seen for clusters observed at lower redshifts, albeit with large uncertainties. Further study with larger datasets is needed to confirm and refine this correlation."}

It compares the outcomes of various scenarios where users are allowed to adjust the transmit power, spreading code and uplink receiver to maximize their own utility, both with the utilization of linear and non-linear multiuser detectors. It is indicated that this problem can be seen as a non-cooperative game and that a single Nash equilibrium should exist. Simulation results have proven that great performance enhancements can be achieved with the utilization of code optimization and non-linear processing, depending on the system's processing gain and the number of users. Finally, the option of non-cooperative games suggested in the paper is shown to outperform alternative propositions."}
{"text":"\nThis article explores the perturbative aspects of a two-dimensional (0,2) sigma model that has been \"B-twisted\" on a holomorphic bundle $\\mathcal E$.

Moreover, the one-loop beta function can be determined by holomorphic data.  When the $(0,2)$ model is at its $(2,2)$ locus, it is referred to as a \"half-twisted\" topological B-model. We explore the sheaf of Chiral de Rham complex (CDR) via mirror symmetry on Calabi-Yau mirror manifolds, allowing us to draw connections to non-K\\\"ahler group manifolds with torsion. These connections suggest relevance of the sheaf of CDR in the current research into generalised mirror symmetry."}
{"text":"\nWe identify magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) torques as essential for efficiently transporting angular momentum in black hole accretion disks, as indicated by seemingly universal outflow phenomena associated with accretion. We illustrate how these MHD-effects modify the radial structure at small radii of the accretion disk and its associated emission spectrum, thereby modifying the flux and spectral energy distribution of quasars. Our resultant new Standard Model has implications for revised estimates of mass accretion rates, setting a trajectory towards a further understanding of black hole accretion."}
{"text":"\nIn this article, we examine the phase interplay between two-color and two-flavor quark matter, in terms of the quark chemical potential \\mu_q and the isospin chemical potential \\mu_I. Through a mean-field model, we calculate the chiral and diquark condensates, \\sigma and \\Delta, self-consistently. Our analysis of the weak coupling and chiral limit reveals that, when 0.71\\Delta_0<\\mu_I<0.75\\Delta_0, a single plane-wave Larkin-Ovchinnikov-Fulde-Ferrell (LOFF) state is preferred over both the isotropic superfluidity and the normal quark matter. We note that at larger densities, the LOFF window becomes wider. When stronger coupling with a non-zero quark mass is present, which is relevant to currently available numerical simulations in lattice two-color QCD, the single plane-wave LOFF state appears only at high densities. Our prediction for the LOFF region is testable with lattice as the proposed system is free from the fermionic sign problem. We detail the energy landscape of the different phases, featuring local minima belonging to the isotropic superfluid phase and the LOFF phase, and a local maximum corresponding to the gapless phase. Our results are illustrative of the path from the unstable gapless phase to the LOFF phase."}

Additionally, we derive a proof that any basis of the orthogonal complement of a multipartite pure state is indistinguishable by separable operations if and only if the state has an orthogonal Schmidt number of at least 3.

The polarization rate of the $\\jp$ produced is sensitive to the amount of the color-octet contribution, which can be tested at the LHC in the near future, when a larger $K$-factor is applied to the charm quark fragmentation probability."}
{"text":"\nThis paper presents the Interval Conjecture (IC) and the Gorenstein Interval Conjecture (GIC) regarding level Hilbert functions. The IC states that, for any given positive integer $\\alpha$, if the $h$-vectors $(1,h_1,...,h_i,...,h_e)$ and $(1,h_1,...,h_i+\\alpha ,...,h_e)$ are both level, then $(1,h_1,...,h_i+\\beta ,...,h_e)$ is also level for all $\\beta =0,1,..., \\alpha$. The GIC is a generalization of IC for symmetric entries of a Gorenstein $h$-vector. Despite a lack of proof, several interesting cases of the conjecture, such as those related to Gorenstein $h$-vectors of degree 4, level $h$-vectors of degree 2, and non-unimodal level $h$-vectors of degree 3, are solved here. This paper further suggests that it would be difficult to explicitly characterize the sets of all Gorenstein or level Hilbert functions, but these conjectures provide the opportunity to discover a strong order in such an intricate and complicated structure."}

{"text":"This paper presents an extended SU(4) model for high-temperature superconductivity which considers the momentum (k)-dependence of the model's predicted observables. We solve for gap equations that depend on k, temperature, and doping using SU(4)k coherent states and show that the new model reduces to the original model for non-k-dependent observables. Our results have relevance for experiments such as ARPES that measure k-dependent properties. Furthermore, the model quantitatively describes the pseudogap temperature scale and might explain why the temperature T* of ARPES-measured values along the anti-nodal direction is higher than other non-momentum-resolving measurements. Additionally, the model proposes that in underdoped regions, there exist doping-related windows around nodal points in the k-space that might enable the complete suppression of antiferromagnetism, to form purely superconducting states."}

{"text":"\nIn a recent work, minimising the action functional proposed by Tseytlin was found to generate the Renormalization Group (RG) flow of the target space metric in the worldsheet sigma model to all orders in perturbation theory. The minimising process is defined by a metric on the space of coupling constants which is positive semi-definite, as shown by Perelman's findings in the Ricci flow. This leads to a monotonicity formula of the flow which should only fail if the beta function perturbation series diverges, which is a sign that curvatures or their derivatives are becoming too large. We validate the monotonicity formula at the next-to-leading order in perturbation theory by calculating the second order terms in the metric on the space of coupling constants, which turns out to not be positive semi-definite. This signals a situation where higher order perturbative corrections may become necessary, as derivatives of curvatures become too large."}

Pump-probe studies conducted at the peak of the vibrational band of N$_2$O reveal lifetimes of approximately 55 and 52 ps in olive oil and octanol respectively. These similar values imply that the anesthetic's energy has a hydrophobic character and consequently, the anesthetic-environment interactions can be studied more accurately using nonlinear infrared spectroscopy.

Our results, obtained both analytically and numerically, show that the ground states of the quantum plaquette model is a solid everywhere.

{"text":"\nThis paper introduces a model of computer networks with expanding dimensions, in which the nodes have fixed dimensionality, while the dimension of the entire network is defined by the total number of its nodes. Based on the properties of data transmission on computer networks, new concepts of stable and unstable networks, distinct from the classical Lyapunov stability, are formulated and a special case of unstable network, called a devil network, is identified. Furthermore it is demonstrated that varied structures and connection weights significantly impact on a network's stability. Finally, criteria for stability, instability and devil networks are established for a general class of networks, with some conditions which are both necessary and sufficient. This paper thus makes a first effort to rigorously formulate an issue of modeling discrete linear time-varying systems with increasing dimensions and examining their fundamental stability."}
{"text":"\nThis paper tackles the challenging problem of elucidating the precise distribution of the visits made by a non-backtracking random walk of length $n$, on a regular $n$-vertex expander of fixed degree and girth $g$.

{"text":"\nScrutinizing the phase behaviour of multiple binary mixtures of two-dimensional hard particles with the ability to rotate, we employ the concept of scaled particle theory. Our emphasis is on mixtures which contain at least one hard rectangle or square. It is possible that a single fluid of hard rectangles develops a tetratic orientation aside from the typical uniaxial nematic order, similar to the biaxial or cubatic phases seen in 3D fluids. Computer simulations have known the likelihood of the tetratic phase persisting in the presence of rectangles with low aspect ratio. In the event that particles incompatible with tetratic order are included in the mixture, it has been proven that the tetratic phase will be destabilised by either a first- or second-order phase transition to the nematic or isolated phase. The stability of the tetratic phase strongly depends on the particle geometry, dimensions and the conditions of the mixture. By combining hard discs or disco-rectangles, which have distinct geometries compared to the rectangles, packing frustrations and demixing behaviours can be experienced. These mixtures may offer the opportunity to test thermodynamically stable tetratic phases in monolayers of hard particles. Finally, it has further been noted that the hard squares of varying sizes may separate when the ratio between them is large enough."}

{"text":"\nThe use of chirped pulse amplification has resulting in a dramatic increase in laser peak power, providing an opportunity for the generation of intense electric fields capable of driving electrons into the relativistic regime. Paraboloidal dense shells and evacuated regions can be generated within a plasma wake wave produced by such lasers, with the shells moving almost at light speed. When subjected to an opposing laser pulse, these relativistic shells behave like flying mirrors - reflecting the incident pulse, frequency-multiplying it and compressing it down to attosecond and zeptosecond levels. This phenomenon has been observed and demonstrated, leading to the potential of reaching ultra-intense electromagnetic field intensities and nearing the Schwinger field, at which point the vacuum rapidly warps and breaks, emitting electron-positron pairs."}
{"text":"\nThis research investigates the impact of lunar precession on the Moon's exposure to Earth's plasmasheet over a period of time. Precession, which is one of the Moon's major orbit properties, causes its nodes to rotate around the ecliptic in a complete revolution every 18.6 years that causes many astronomical events such as drift of solar and lunar eclipses. This study demonstrates how its orbit affects the Moon's encounters with the plasmasheet and estimates that from 1960 to 2030 this amounted to up to 40 hours per month at the apex of the 18-year cycle and 10 hours per month at its minimum. Furthermore, this fluctuation could potentially lead to a significant change in the level of lunar surface charging due to incoming plasmasheet electrons. Evidence for this is found in many measurements taken during the 1994-2000 maxima cycle, where bombardment and charging of the lunar surface is suspected to have occurred. Finally, this research highlights that lunar environment analysis should take into account the precession cycle of the Moon, particularly when designing lunar exploration devices for the upcoming 2012-19 maxima cycle."}
{"text":"\nThe relationship between the growth rate and gain of the Cyclotron Maser Instability (CMI) due to the electron velocity distribution in the auroral cavity is studied in this paper. Using a parameterized horseshoe electron velocity distribution, various model parameters and propagation directions have been systematically assessed in order to establish the dependence of CMI growth rates on the specified parameters. It was determined that the growth rate is determined by the loss cone opening angle, which must be less than $90^{o}$ in order for CMI development. It was found that the growth rate was sharply peaked when the radiation was perpendicular to the direction of propagation, with a full-width half-maximum of $1.7^{o}$. This is consistent with both numerical simulations and the k-vector orientations observed. The fractional bandwidth fell within the range of 10$^{-4}$ to 10$^{-2}$ as a function of the specified direction of propagation. This matched nearly every observed fractional AKR burst bandwidth. We discover that our calculated RX mode emergent intensity can account for the observed AKR intensities, given the assumptions of convective growth length of 20-40 km and a speed of 0.15$c$. In the case of LO mode radiation, the growth rates found could only be equal to or higher than those observed if the number density was at least 100 times more than the average energetic electron density measured in auroral cavities. This suggests that LO mode radiation may be produced through mode conversion of its RX mode radiation rather than directly through the CMI mechanism. Lastly, our findings show that large ion solitary waves (ion holes) may increase the growth rate by a factor of 2-4 and thus amplify the gain by 40 dB or more, depending on the convective growth length of the structure being studied. Such gains may also be achievable through EMIC waves."}
{"text":"\nThis paper reports the findings of a new cross-identification process that utilised the All-Sky Compiled Catalogue of 2.5 Million Stars (ASCC-2.5) with the General Catalogue of Radial Velocities and with recent other published radial velocity lists and catalogues. The purpose was to provide accurate data on J2000 equatorial coordinates, proper motion, and photometry, as well as spectral types, radial velocities, and variability flags of approximately 55,000 ASCC-2.5 stars. This data was used to compile an up-to-date Catalogue of Radial Velocities of Open Clusters and Associations (CRVOCA) including the mean RVs of a total of 516 open clusters andstellar associations. This includes 330 clusters and associations with previously published mean RVs, but whose data was critically reviewed and partly revised. The combination of the latest available data shows that while the mean RVs ofyoung clusters are generally better known than those of the older ones, the current collection only represents less than 30% of the total number of about 1,820 open clusters known in the galaxy."}
{"text":"\nBy means of extensive Monte Carlo simulations we investigate the transport of movable spins within a multilayer with three ferromagnetic films held together antiferromagnetically with sandwiched nonmagnetic spacers. Ising spin models and in-plane transfer are deemed applicable in this research. We observe that the spin current between the layers changes drastically depending on the magnetic order at a temperature T below (above) the transition temperature Tc; a swift (insignificant) current is seen. At the same temperature, an extraordinary shift in resistance is observed. Furthermore, a sharp peak in the spin current is observed in the critical region beyond Tc in results of the formation of intermediate domains between low Temperature structural order and the real paramagnetic disordered stage. In comparison to pertinent experiments, we come across a practically faithful feasibility of our conclusions. Besides, we examine side effects of various elements of the model for example, capacity range, intensity of airy and magnetic fields, sizes of magnetic films and nonmagnetic interlayers."}
{"text":"\nThrough a mathematical analysis, we describe the behavior of electrostatic interactions between opposite charged and planar surfaces in different salt concentrations and levels of surface charge density (not necessarily the same magnitude). We establish a correlation between the salt concentration and the resulting pressure (attracting or repelling), and uncover an analytical expression for the change of pressure. Our findings provide support for the high-salt hypothesis by Parsegian and Gingell (where the interactions are exponentially screened) as well as the low-salt and high-charge idea of Lau and Pincus (where the relevant length scales are spacing and Gouy-Chapman). When salt is low and charge density is high, the attractive force remains significant over long distances. The change in counter-ion concentration as the plate distance decreases links the pressure to our predictions. Our conclusions outline multiple scaling cases of pressure as a function of salt and surface charge, which can be applied to surface force experiments using charged membranes."}
{"text":"\nThis research seeks to find a solution to the century-old problem of the origin of early-type R stars. These stars are known to exist as single-stars, and have properties relating to being carbon-rich K-type giants, having a solar oxygen and magnesium isotope ratios, s-process and iron abundances and being part of the Galactic thick disk. Conventional single star models are unable to explain them, so binary star mergers were proposed as a solution. Calculations were done to determine how many merged stars of helium cores could exist, resulting in several evolutionary channels. The most common approach was combining a helium white dwarf with a star on the red giant branch. It was also established that this could give up to ten times more early-R stars than what is present in Hipparcos observations, and some explanations were suggested to determine which channels are improbable. This is the first attempt to create a model which can test ideas related to common envelope evolution, stellar mergers, rotation and the helium flash. It may provide a solution to the century-old problem."}
{"text":"\nThis article critically examines anthropic models in which an ensemble of universes is assumed, strictly disallowing the assumption that the CMB temperature is known. More accurate approximations of the growth of perturbations and the mass function of dark haloes are put forth as well.

The falsifiability of this reasoning is then evaluated."}
{"text":"\nIn this article, we investigate the possible role of elastic mismatch between \nepidermis and mesophyll as a motivator for the development of leaf venation. \nThe classic 'canalization hypothesis' indicates that the localized hormone \nauxin out of the leaves directs cell differentiation to create veins. Although\nauxin may play an important role in vein formation, the canalization principle\nmay not account for all the features of the vascular system of leaves, in \nparticular, the amount of vein loops. Our model is based on the concept \nthat mechanical instabilities can lead to hierarchical patterns with multiple \nclosed loops. When this model is applied to the structure of high order veins, \nthe numerical observations show the same qualities as observed venation \npatterns and, furthermore, share the same statistical properties. We suggest \nthat the agreement between the actual and computed patterns shows strong proof \nfor the role of mechanical stress in venation development."}
{"text":"\nThis paper investigates the stationary state of an asymmetric target process, providing new insight into a migration process related to the zero-range process. This process is distinguished from the original in the sense that the rate of transfer of particles is a function of the arrival instead of departure site. We analyse the ensuing stationary state, which can differ from the symmetrical version with a continuous condensation transition at a finite density $\\rho_c$, depending on the dimensions. Particularly, in one dimension the system remains homogeneous even at high densities, in contrast to multidimensional cases that display a phase transition at a threshold density $\\rho_0$ much higher than $\\rho_c$. In the former, typical configurations comprise of equally populated regions separated by low density sites, whereas in the latter, the condensate is identified by an extended region along the direction of the mean current, in addition to the critical background."}
{"text":"\nThis research provides a new statistical approach for classifying extrasolar planets. By utilizing principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering, we have managed to find five distinct groups of planets. We can see the importance of environmental parameters such as stellar masses and gas composition on the classification of these groups. Furthermore, we discovered strong correlations between properties such as density, semi-major axis, and eccentricity. These correlations and their effects on the formation and evolution of these planets will be discussed."}
{"text":"\nThis paper follows a network-based approach to understand the statistical qualities of conformation spaces in protein folding. We map conformations to a network with links representing transitions occurring due to rotations around chemical bonds. Self-avoidance of a protein chain introduces correlations in the conformation network leading to similar trends in the energy landscape. In addition, these connections also determine the scaling behavior of the folding network. By implementing molecular dynamics simulations, we propose that the structure of folding pathways is organized into one of scale-free networks, which is also confirmed by the universality class of random energy models. Furthermore, we suggest that the energy landscape correlation is pivotal for recovering the connection exponent and the overall structure of the folding network alters at elevated temperatures. This result is verified by our simulations of the AK peptide."}
{"text":"\nWe apply a spherically symmetric Photon Dominated Region (PDR) model to Barnard 68, a dark globular-shaped cloud, to study the chemistry and energy balance in the cloud surface. Exploring the three lowest rotational transitions of CO and the [CI] 3P_1-3P_0 fine structure transition, we compare the output of the model to the observations, evaluating the role of PAHs in the chemical network and the impact of depletion and varying the FUV field. Our results demonstrate that the 12CO and [CI] emission can be plausibly modeled using a FUV field of 1-0.75 chi_0, while it is more difficult to account for the 13CO emissions. Inclusion of PAHs increases the [CI] output by 50%, but having little effect on the [CII] emission. CO depletion modestly reduces the intensity of the 12CO and 13CO lines, but does not fully resolve the discrepancy. To further test our model, future observations with astronomical lens such as APEX, NANTEN2, HERSCHEL or SOFIA should be conducted with respect to the [CII] 2P_3\/2-2P_1\/2, [CI] 3P_2-3P_1 and 12CO J= 5-4 and 4-3 transitions."}
{"text":"A detailed survey of the sigma Ori cluster centre was conducted to investigate the population of low-mass stars and substellar objects present. The survey employed near-infrared, optical and X-ray imaging to detect objects ranging from massive early-type stars down to the deuterium burning mass limit. Ten previously unknown sources were found to exhibit X-ray emission and six new members were identified for their similarity to the established sequence on the I vs. I-Ks Diagram. Eight-zero (+\/-20) % of observed sources were found to harbour X-ray emission and the spatial density of stars was found to be extremely high, at 1.6+\/-0.1 arcmin-2. An object with X-ray emission and magnitudes close to those of previously-discovered brown dwarfs in the cluster was located at a distance of around 11,000 AU to sigma Ori AB. These results suggest that the centre of sigma Orionis is not deficient in substellar objects."}
{"text":"\nObservations made using the Very Large Array at 1.4 and 4.9 GHz on 8 April 2003 and 7 August 1993, 29 August 1999, and 31 October 1999 indicate the presence of a core-jet structure in the Sy 1.5 galaxy NGC 5033. At the nucleus, the radio spectrum is moderately steep. Further away, in the inner kpc region, a steeper spectrum was detected, which is typical of galaxies where high energy losses are experienced. This suggests that the escape rate of cosmic ray electrons from NGC 5033 may be low. An analysis of the radio to far infrared relation revealed that the radio and far infrared emission from NGC 5033 are likely driven by a starburst event over the past 10 million years, with a supernova type Ib\/c and II rate of 0.045 per year. A deep 8.4 GHz VLA-D image also pointed to the possible existence of a radio spur in NGC 5033, possibly as a result of hot superbubbles caused by successive supernovae in a giant molecular cloud."}

{"text":"\nWe investigate the mass function of substellar objects in the young sigma Orionis open cluster, which is 3+\/-2 Ma old and is located at a distance of 360^+70_-60 pc. A deep survey was done in the IJ-bands across an area of 790 arcmin^2 centred on the cluster. This was supplemented with infrared follow-up in the HKs- and Spitzer 3.6-8.0 mum-bands. Based on colour-magnitude diagrams, 49 candidate cluster members in the magnitude interval 16.1 mag < I < 23.0 mag were identified. Of these, 30 were verified to be true cluster members, with 11 being below the deuterium burning limit and thus classified as planetary-mass object candidates. The slope of the substellar mass spectrum in the mass range between 0.11 Msol and 0.006 Msol was found to be +0.6+\/-0.2, with a high probability of an opacity mass limit below 0.006 Msol if these objects are formed due to fragmentation. Moreover, 47 +\/- 15% of the brown dwarfs in the sigma Orionis have been discovered to have circumsubstellar discs. This likely indicates that the formation of both low-mass stars and substellar objects, even below the deuterium-burning mass limit, is subject to the same mechanism."}

{"text":"\nThis study explores the stability of an optically trapped ultracold spin-1\/2 Fermi gas (SFG) in a tight waveguide (1D regime). Focusing on a 1D attractive zero-range odd-wave interaction induced by a 3D p-wave Feshbach resonance and the usual zero-range even-wave repulsive interaction, two and three-body correlation functions in the plane of even and odd-wave coupling constants are both investigated. The analysis suggests that the SFG should be stable against three-body recombination across a wide area encompassing parts of the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases. Interestingly, the limiting case of the fermionic Tonks-Girardeau gas (FTG) poses a counter-example to this stability. The dipolar interaction and Zeeman term due to a resonance-generating magnetic field do not decrease the region of stability of the SFG."}
{"text":"\nThis paper reports on the second of two concerning the intense, luminous quasar PHL 1811 situated closeby at a redshift of 0.192. The first of the reports stated that PHL 1811 is intrinsically weak to X-rays. Here, HST STIS optical and ultra-violet spectra and ground-based optical spectra are presented. The optical and ultraviolet line emission is extraordinary, with no signs of forbidden or semi-forbidden lines. The near-ultraviolet spectrum is largely composed of strong FeII and FeIII element lines and unusual low-ionization elements such as NaID and CaII H&K. High-ionization lines are barely visible, with CIV having an equivalent width of merely 6.6A, around a fifth of the one recorded by quasar composite spectra. An unexpected feature near 1200A is described with the help of Ly\u03b1, NV, SiII and CIII* using the shifted CIV profile as a template. Utilizing photoionization modeling, one can infer that the rare, peculiar line emission is primarily caused by the soft SED, significantly lowering the gas temperature which leads to less competent emission of collisionally-thrilled lines. This effect is similar to when faced with high-density gas, where cooling can be inefficient. PHL 1811 is uncommon but not impossible to come by since most quasar surveys overlook such objects."}
{"text":"  This article reviews the energy levels of spin-1\/2 fermions when interacting through a two-body potential with an infinite scattering length and zero effective range, otherwise known as the Unitary limit.

The energy is reported as $\\xi = 4\/9$, a result independently offered by previous work, but revised to $\\xi = 0.24$ when integrating the momentum dependent interaction with the Fermi sea. Additionally, consideration of hh-ladders provide suggested energy estimates of $\\xi = 0.4$ to 0.6, though a Green's function calculation would be required for a successful and reliable outcome."}
{"text":"\nThis paper aims to explore the unique abilities of parallel manipulators by examining their direct kinematic solutions in relation to a given set of input joint values. Additionally, the paper also seeks to distinguish the joint space from the workspace and investigate the special characteristics which can be observed in the latter. A 3-RPR planar parallel manipulator is taken as an example to demonstrate how the notion of aspect, as defined by Borrel in 1986 for serial manipulators, can be connected to these manipulators. The research further reveals that the distinction of characteristic surfaces can distinguish the workspace into its basic regions, thus unveiling the occurrence of new uniqueness domains. An octree model of spaces is then used to analyse the joint space, the workspace, and the sets identified above."}
{"text":"This paper investigates the kinematic design of a new three-degree-of-freedom hybrid manipulator based on a five-bar planar mechanism. The hybrid manipulator consists of a combination of both serial and parallel elements, and its distinctive kinematic arrangement has potential to prevent parallel singularities, leading to a larger operating workspace as compared to both serial and parallel manipulators. In addition, since actuators are all located on the first axis, the inertial load is significantly reduced, and the high stiffness of the manipulator enables high accuracy in positioning. To optimize the designs, a comprehensive analysis of the kinematic and mechanical properties related to the length of the links is discussed."}
{"text":"\nOur research into AGN in the GOODS-South field draws upon the use of optical variability. A collection of 22 mid-infrared power law sources and 102 X-ray sources are observed via HST ACS images. A variability significance value is assigned to each of the objects in the sample that reflects the magnitude of their variability on a timescale of 45 days. We compare the variability significance with the optical, mid-IR, and X-ray characteristics of the sources. AGN candidates that were selected either by X-ray or mid-IR sources display 26% optical variability, increasing to 51% for those sources with soft X-ray band ratios. For those mid-IR AGN candidates characterized by Broad Line AGN SEDs, optical variability is recorded for 64%. Although mostly unobscured AGNs show the most significant optical variability, obscured AGNs are also apparent as variables - in particular, 2 mid-IR power law-selected AGN candidates that lack X-ray emission demonstrate optical variability, signifying their potential AGN nature."}
{"text":"\nWe have conducted an in-depth analysis of the globular cluster NGC 2419 located in the Galaxy by compiling B,V, and I time-series CCD photometric data over approximately 10 years, measuring far beyond the previously reported tidal radius of the cluster. This has resulted in 101 variable stars identified, including 60 being all-new discoveries. The measured average periods of the RR Lyrae stars confirm that NGC 2419 is an Oosterhoff II cluster and suggests the distance modulus to be 19.60 +\/- 0.05. Additionally, we observed stars within the cluster's main body to reach up to a radius of 10.5', and hypothesized that they may extend up to an even further 15', suggesting the literature tidal radius may be underestimated. Most noteworthy amongst the observations is that red giant branch is narrow, making any significant metallicity spreads unlikely, as well as the detection of a blue hook in the cluster. Our results seemingly challenge the suggestion that NGC 2419 may have an extragalactic origin or be a remnant of a dwarf galaxy that has been tidally disrupted by the Milky Way."}
{"text":"\nRecently, it has been proposed that bimodality in global colors of galaxies is related to the two-part makeup of disk-bulge galaxies. This bimodality separates galaxies into a ``red sequence'', populated mainly by early-type galaxies, and a ``blue cloud'' composed mainly of late-type disk galaxies. Intermediate types (Sa-Sbc) can be found in both areas. In a sample of nearby galaxies, an analysis has been conducted with high-resolution images to better understand the connection between bulge properties and bimodal color distribution. The findings show that the red-blue dichotomy is linked to the type of bulge and not solely due to bulge prominence, giving information to the evolutionary history of the galaxy. It has been shown that classical bulges, which appear more like ellipticals, have a global red color while pseudobulges, which are flattened and disk-like, are found in globally blue galaxies, regardless of the disk-to-bulge ratio. In addition, the type of bulge connects to other global structural parameters."}
{"text":"\nBy conducting the first comprehensive analysis of the temperature, gravity and mass of the white dwarfs in NGC 6791, an 8 Gyr old, metal-rich open star cluster, we have identified a significant fraction of these stars as being undermassive and thus likely formed through an enhanced mass-loss on the red giant branch. This potentially explains the presence of an extreme horizontal branch as well as the peculiarly young age for the cluster deduced from white dwarf cooling theory. Our findings provide direct evidence of the dependence of mass-loss on metallicity, and how this may help to account for ultraviolet excess observed in ellipticals."}
{"text":"\nUsing XMM and Chandra over a period of 2.4 years, we have studied the X-ray timing of the 105-ms X-ray pulsar PSR J1852+0040, located in the SNR Kes 79.

Comparison of the X-ray luminosity to the energy loss rate suggests a possible origin of accretion from a fallback disk of supernova debris, inferring a weak B-field in the neutron star. This conclusion is consistent with another CCO, 1E 1207.4-5209. Our hypothesis of radio-quiet CCOs suggests that neutron stars born with a B-field weaker than 1e11 G and spin periods longer than 0.1 s are excluded from radio pulsar surveys, excluding a similar radio-quiet CCO as the origin of the lack of a pulsar found in SN 1987A."}
{"text":"\nThe rigorous determination of cosmological parameters such as dark energy and the measurement of large-scale structure quantities like sigma-8 require highly accurate probes of peculiar velocities in the universe. Type Ia supernova surveys promise to provide just such results. Based on a small number of supernovae presently available, it is already possible to measure the dipole and quadrupole of the local velocity field out to z ~ 0.025. With an upcoming continuous all-sky survey like the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), various luminosity distances of the surrounding supernovae can be accurately recorded. This will allow for higher precision characterizations of local velocity fields of the universe, given that the host galaxy's redshifts are known. Utilizing mock catalogues from survey projections, it can be estimated that a future supernova survey has the ability to measure sigma-8 with a roughly 5% precision at 95%C.L. This level of performance is nearly comparable to upcoming galaxy and weak lensing surveys, requiring relatively little observation effort for such a major confirmation of the matter power spectrum."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate whether the shape of HII regions around bright quasars during reionization is detectable in the small-scale redshifted 21 cm power spectrum. Our results suggest that if a significant portion of the IGM at redshift z=10 is ionized by quasars with typical ionizing luminosity, the effect of the anisotropic shapes can lead to an enhancement of more than 10 percent in the 21 cm power spectrum in the radial direction compared to the transverse direction. This level of anisotropy surpasses that of the redshift-space distortion, yet the opposite sign. With on-going experiments such as the MWA, this anisotropy should be detectable and will give insight into the ionizing yield and age of the ionizing sources, and the intergalactic neutral gas in the vicinity of the quasars."}

The asymmetry in the perturbed Oort Cloud in comparison to the spherical shape yields angular changes in the intensity of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). If the passing star has a mass of 1 solar mass and a distance of $1750 \\au$, the square of the fractional CMB force quadrupole moment would be $4.5 \\times 10^{-15}, 6.7 \\times 10^{-12}, 1.1 \\times 10^{-9}$ at the frequencies 30, 353, 545 GHz (these being the frequency bands of the upcoming Planck satellite). We furthermore review the quadrupole spectral distortions created by the Disturbed Cloud that will exist regardless of the outcome of the perturbation and the consequent form of the Oort Cloud. For comparison, the current cosmological model affirms a square fractional CMB temperature fluctuation quadrupole moment of $1.76 \\times 10^{-10}$, corresponding to perturbations in the CMB strength of $2.9 \\times 10^{-10}, 6.8 \\times 10^{-9}, 1.6 \\times 10^{-8}$ at frequencies 30, 353, 545 GHz, respectively.

{"text":"\nThe energy conditions provide a powerful tool for understanding the current accelerated expansion of the universe. However, when assessing the relation between these conditions and observations, it is essential to bear in mind the potential distortions that can arise due to integration. An illustration of this caution is provided by the $\\Lambda$CDM model: while the deceleration parameter $q(z)$ crosses the line $q(z) = 0$ at redshift $z \\simeq 0.76$, the obtained result differs drastically when considering the dimensionless Hubble parameter $E(z)$, which involves the integration of $q(z)$: $E(z)$ does not cross the line of $q(z) = 0$ before $z = 2$. Thus caution should be taken when attempting to draw physical conclusions from integral forms. With this in mind, we explore the holistic implications of energy conditions and their role in determining the current accelerated expansion of the universe. Our results strongly suggest that, indeed, between the epoch of galaxy formation and current times, our universe has experienced an accelerating period."}

We use the stellar velocity dispersions to discern the dynamical masses of these galaxies and compare them to the stellar masses determined through optical and IR photometry. Our work creates a statistically-robust calculation of the earlier-mentioned evolving dynamical mass function. Results of our analysis reach the same conclusions as those from Bundy et al. in 2005, that spheroidal galaxies have grown in abundance from top-down. Looking at the ratio of spheroidal growth to that of dark matter halos, we have found that major mergers are not enough to explain the appearance of these galaxies in z~1. Consequently, we propose that other mechanisms, such as morphological changes, are accountable for this evolution."}
{"text":"\nAn X-ray source, 1RXS J141256.0+792204 -- dubbed Calvera -- has been discovered at high Galactic latitude through observations with ROSAT All-Sky Survey Bright Source Catalog, {\\em Swift}, Gemini-North, and the Chandra X-ray Observatory. Its X-ray to optical flux ratio is F_X\/F_V > 8700 (3 sigma). The object's likely placement at a distance of 5.1kpc from the Galactic disk points to an extreme space velocity of 5100 km s-1 or the source's inability to cool according to theoretical predictions. Alternatively, it may be an anomalous X-ray pulsar, though this interpretation has conflicts with their typical properties. Calvera's characteristics most closely match those of nearby (80 to 260 pc) radio pulsars, similar to those found in 47 Tuc. Further observations will be necessary to determine its exact classification and make it a viable target for X-ray studies, radio pulsar timing array, and LIGO investigations. If it is, indeed, a millisecond pulsar, it is tied for highest X-ray flux and may be one of the closest known to the northern hemisphere."}
{"text":"\nThis paper outlines an analysis of user attention in two collaborative tagging communities: CiteULike and Bibsonomy. Through this exploration, we examine the popularity of tagging activities among the users, define metrics for similarity in user interests, and determine whether interest-based structure can potentially improve the scalability and usability of large collaborative tagging communities. Starting from the observation that tagging communities can struggle to cope with the increasing diversity of content, we aim to gain insights into how the usage patterns of large populations can be leveraged for better navigation. Results from our characterization illustrate a segmentation of interests between individuals with unique preferences and a core set with interspersed interests. Furthermore, we present preliminary findings demonstrating the usefulness of the interest-based structure in facilitating content navigation."}
{"text":"\nThis article discusses the observation of 236 GRB afterglows out of which 30 have their X-ray light-curves exhibiting an abrupt steepening (\"break\") anywhere between 0.1 and 10 days after the trigger. It is argued that majority of these can be attributed to a standard jet model, however, other possibilities are yet to be ruled out. Meanwhile, 27 other afterglows appear to display a similar break, even though the evidence is not that convincing. It is theorized then, that the fraction of well-monitored Swift afterglows with potential jet-breaks should be around 60 percent, comparable to the 75 percent of those prior to Swift studied using 1 day optical light-curves breaks. Further, the correlation between the peak energy of GRB spectrum for isotropic and collimated output with the jet-breaker time is explored, indicating an amended version of the previously established Amati and Ghirlanda relations."}
{"text":"\nThis article presents a novel approach to the definition of angles in relation to infinite-dimensional subspaces of a Hilbert space. Inspired by work of E. J. Hannan (1961\/1962) in the field of canonical correlations of stochastic processes, we utilize spectral theory of selfadjoint operators to unveil the properties of these angles, such as those corresponding to orthogonal complements. We analyze classical gaps and angles of Dixmier and Friedrichs, demonstrating how they are characterized in terms of the angles we introduce. Additionally, we describe how point angles, analogous to point operator spectra, can be defined. In doing so, we develop a method to bound the Hausdorff distance between the sets of the squared cosines of the angles associated with the subspace and its perturbations. We also discuss how the squared cosines of the angles from one subspace to the other can be interpreted as Ritz values in the Rayleigh-Ritz method. Furthermore, analogous results to those just discussed are presented for the alternating-projectors method, including a potential acceleration for domain decomposition based on the conjugate gradient approach as an example."}

The proton flux and beam shape were calculated through the 27Al(p,x)7Be monitor reaction before the samples were arranged across 12 target disks in the 15 cm diameter, 92 cm thick Pb target that was exposed for 18 hours. 1196 gamma spectra were measured and around 1500 reaction rates were determined. The data was simulated using ENDF\/B6 below 20 MeV, MENDL2 for 20-100 MeV neutrons, and MENDL2P up to 200 MeV. Reasonable consistency was found between the simulations and the experimental results."}
{"text":"\nWe present an investigation of matter density perturbations and the effective gravitational constant in modified gravity models of dark energy. The analysis focuses on the sub-horizon scales by deriving an equation from a general Lagrangian density depending on Ricci scalar R, a scalar field phi and a kinetic term X. This allows us to constraint potential observations of large-scale structure and weak lensing. We determine the matter perturbations, delta_m, and the gravitational potential Phi for a class of analytically solvable models, specifically a f(R) dark energy model with a Lagrangian density of alpha R^{1+m}-Lambda. Furthermore, scalar-tensor models with the Lagrangian density f=F(phi)R+2p(phi,X) are related to coupled dark energy scenarios in the Einstein frame, and a conformal transformation produces the same perturbations found within the current literature. Finally, we estimate the evolution of perturbations in both Jordan and Einstein frames when dark energy energy fraction is kept constant during the matter-dominated epoch."}
{"text":"\nIn this paper, optimal cache-oblivious memory layouts for mesh updates are presented. These layouts can guarantee asymptotically optimal performance when given any set of memory parameters. Mesh updates are essential in many applications, like finite-element methods, image rendering, and collision detection. The layout algorithms require $O(|G|\\log^2|G|)$ time both in expectation and with high probability to find a fully balanced decomposition tree of the mesh $G$, followed by an in-order traversal of its leaves. For a mesh with $d$ dimensions, block size $B$, and cache size $M$ (where $M=\\Omega(B^d)$), the memory transfers used by the mesh update are $O(1+|G|\/B)$. The paper also gives a faster algorithm, which decreases the runtime almost by $\\log|G|\/\\log\\log|G|$ and uses a relax-balanced decomposition tree. The memory transfers of the layout in this case are $O(1+(|G|\/B)(\\log^2(|G|\/M) + \\log|G|))$. Additionally, it is shown how mesh updates exhibit degraded performance when the cache size is smaller, namely when $M=o(B^d)$."}

{"text":"This article presents findings related to the design of the Slide-o-Cam transmission, a type of cam mechanism with multiple rollers mounted on a common translating follower. It is intended to replace current ball-screws in Orthoglide, a three-DOF parallel robot for machining applications. Strategies to optimize the pressure angle of the transmission, which serves as a performance index and determines the amount of force transferred to the load and machine frame, were studied. The two approaches employed were increasing the number of cams and lobes on each cam. The results of these strategies are reported herein."}
{"text":"\nIn today's industrial market, many machine tools have a conventional serial kinematic architecture, which is characterized by a heavy load on each axis for actuators and joints. High Speed Machining has identified several disadvantages that this approach can bring, such as low stiffness resulting in lower accuracy and a restriction on dynamic performance. Due to these issues, parallel kinematic machines (PKMs) are becoming increasingly popular. These types of machines show many advantages over the serial ones: more rigidity, reduced inertia loads and enhanced dynamic performance. Despite this, the development of PKMs for industrial use still requires careful consideration and design with various criteria taken into account.\n\nParticular attention is given in this paper towards the kinetostatic criteria that involve the Jacobian matrix of the structure. The paper further explains the potential benefits of PKMs over conventional serial machines and examines existing PKMs. Lastly, it presents a project involving a prototype of a small-scale machine tool developed by the IRCCyN research center."}
{"text":"\nCovariant density functional theory is extended in this paper to include Particle-Vibration Coupling (PVC), by calculating low-lying collective vibrations in Relativistic Random Phase Approximation (RRPA) and constructing an energy dependent self-energy for the Dyson equation. Bethe-Salpeter equation in the particle-hole ($ph$) channel is solved in the Time Blocking Approximation (TBA), without the need for additional parameters or double counting. This method has been applied for an investigation of damping phenomena in spherical nuclei with closed shells $^{208}$Pb and $^{132}$Sn, which has produced results that are in agreement with experimental data as well as results of the semi-phenomenological non-relativistic approach. This study enhances the capability of covariant density functional theory to give a consistent description of nuclear excite states."}
{"text":"\nIn this article, we speculate on a potential exact solution to the three-dimensional (3D) Ising model on simple orthorhombic lattices. To this end, we propose two conjectures: introducing an additional rotation in the fourth curled-up dimension, as well as defining the appropriate weight factors on the eigenvectors, which act as boundaries to address the topological problem of the 3D Ising model. Utilizing Spinor analysis, the partition function is evaluated using these conjectures. The critical temperature of the simple orthorhombic Ising lattices is then determined according to the relation of KK* = KK'+KK''+K'K'' or sinh2Ksinh2(K'+K''+K'K''\/K)=1. Furthermore, the logarithmic singularity at the transition point, plus the explicit expressions for the spontaneous magnetization and spin correlation functions are derived. Moreover, the critical exponents of the simple orthorhombic Ising lattices, alpha = 0, beta = 3\/8, gamma = 5\/4, delta = 13\/3, eta = 1\/8 and nu = 2\/3, show the universal behavior and satisfy the scaling laws. Finally, the 3D to 2D crossover differs from the 2D to 1D crossover and a gradual transition of exponents from 3D to 2D is observed. The results of this article are compared with those of other approximate methods and experimental evidence."}
{"text":"\n\n Photometric measurements taken by forthcoming space missions allow us to determine the size, mass, and density of exoplanets' satellites. We have conducted an analysis on the photometric transit timing variation ($TTV_p$) to analyze the light curve effects of the transiting planet and its satellite. We introduce the concept of the 'photocenter' time of the transit, which is equivalent to the transit of a fixed photocenter that orbits the barycenter, resulting in the photometric transit timing variations whose exact value depends on the ratio of the density, mass, and size of the satellite and the planet. When the density ratio is known, it permits a reliable estimation of the size and mass of an exomoon. An upper limit of $TTV_p$ can be set if the density ratio cannot be estimated accurately. We tested this method on the Earth-Moon system transit in front of the Sun and found that when assuming similar densities, the estimated size and mass of the Moon (0.020 Earth-mass and 0.274 Earth-size) were comparable to the real values within a factor of 2. When using the real density ratio (about 0.6), the results were 0.010 Earth-Mass and 0.253 Earth-size, which showed agreement with the true values within 20%."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate the effects of a relativistic jet crossing quark-gluon plasma on the chromohydrodynamics instabilities. We examine this issue by looking into the hydrodynamic equations describing the jet and the plasma, in the linear response approximation. This is valid over short time scales, and allows us to investigate how the velocity of the jet, magnitude of the collective mode momentum, and the angle between them, changes the dispersion laws. We find that for jet velocities larger than the sound speed of the plasma, and for momenta smaller than a certain value, instabilities arise. Additionally, in the case of ultrarelativistic jet velocity, longitudinal modes become stable, and the most unstable modes have an angle between the jet velocity and its momentum greater than around $\\pi\/8$. Our results hint at a novel method to explain jet quenching, in which the jet would lose energy exciting colored instabilities."}
{"text":"\nUsing financial data from Japanese businesses from 2003 to 2005, we demonstrate a static log-normal distribution in the middle scale category. This is achieved by deploying a Non-Gibrat's law within the confines of the detailed balance, accompanied by two assumptions. Firstly, the probability density function of revenue growth is modeled as an exponential tent-shaped structure. Secondly, the starting point of the revenue growth distribution is homogenized across multiple partitions. With this static system in place, we apply a quasi-static mechanism to obtain a log-normal distribution in the same intermediate scale sector. This involves the same Non-Gibrat's law with detailed quasi-balance and the two aforementioned assumptions. We obtain a power-law with a variable Pareto's index in the larger scale region, together with a log-normal distribution in the middle scale region. Notably, both changes in the Pareto's index and variation in the variance of the log-normal distribution depend on the parameter of the detailed quasi-balance. Thus, these two features are linked."}
{"text":"\nRecent cosmological surveys have provided an abundance of detailed data from distant galaxies out to redshift 0.3, with further surveys predicted to reach a redshift of 1. This makes it possible to application of Einstein's equations that determine the spacetime metric of the universe based on observational data. This will more accurately quantify homogeneity than what has been assumed thus far. This paper presents the beginning of a project towards such a numerical implementation using the primary observational data composed of redshifts, absolute luminosities, diameter and number densities, source evolution functions, and masses. An algorithm was tested to calculate the metric of a spherical-symmetric dust universe from this data, with manmade datasets verifying its success. Current surveys do not have sufficient accuracy to actualise the potential of this project, but in the coming years refinements to the algorithm and more powerful surveys may allow this numerical implementation to come to fruition."}
{"text":"\nA recent investigation of pure 4He and mixtures of 3He-4He exposed to solid substrates reveals a shift in the corresponding film thickness upon nearing the lambda-transition and tricritical endpoint, respectively. The resulting phenomenon, which is caused by the critical Casimir force f_C, is analyzed in terms of models that represent universality classes. Results from the data suggest the emergence of a 'soft-mode' phase, which promotes a pronounced maximum in f_C near the tricritical point. Simulations also suggest that logarithmic corrections of  ~L^(-3)(ln L)^(1\/2) govern the behavior of the force when in close proximity to the tricritical point, overriding the predominant contributions from the background dispersion forces."}

A wide range of methods are used to confirm the predictions and reveal any peculiarities, including analysis of triangle equations using S-matrix from Hollowood, functional integral approach coupled with a bootstrap procedure, and the calculation of transmission factors for the lightest breathers. It has been observed that the quantum and classical pictures may differ; for instance, in a quantum context, a specific range of the coupling constant can lead to an unstable bound state, contrary to what can be seen in the classical framework."}
{"text":"In this work, the behaviour of polymer chains in good solvents at low temperature and high temperature is studied. Two theoretical approaches - a low-temperature (LT) approximation and a high-temperature (HT) approximation - are constructed based on the two-body interaction of penetrable spheres (PSs). To evaluate the accuracy of the two calculations, Monte Carlo simulations are conducted at various temperatures and densities. Despite being basic, HT and LT approximation are successful in approximating the simulated data over the specified temperature and density ranges. In addition, the results obtained from numerical solutions of the Percus-Yevick (PY) equation and the hypernetted-chain approximation are likewise compared, with the latter demonstrating a superior performance at low temperatures."}
{"text":"\nThe dynamic magnetic susceptibility, $\\chi$, of several intermetallic materials exhibiting ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic and metamagnetic transitions has been measured with a 14 MHz tunnel diode oscillator (TDO). The precision of the TDO measurements provides a thorough understanding of the temperature and field dependent $\\chi$. A sharp peak in $\\chi(T)$ near the Curie temperature, $T_C$ is observed for materials with local magnetic moments and this peak decreases and shifts to a higher temperature in the presence of small applied DC fields. Interestingly, a broad maximum is observed in itinerant ferromagnets like ZrZn$_2$ and this response is distinct from that of local moment materials. TDO measurements are further found to be able to detect changes in spin order and metamagnetic transitions as well. A critical scaling of $\\chi(T,H)$ near $T_C$ can be seen in CeVSb$_3$ and CeAgSb$_2$."}
{"text":"  This article examines the relationship between noncommutative tori and noncommutative elliptic curves through a category of equivariant differential modules on the complex plane.

Our category enjoys the advantageous feature of being Tannakian, enabling us to identify its corresponding affine group scheme as the algebraic hull of $\\mathbb{Z}^2$ through an equivariant form of the Riemann-Hilbert correspondence.

{"text":"This article explores the evolution of SMBHB and how it affects the acceleration of jet precession in galactic nuclei. Utilizing models for jet precession and SMBHB evolution, we calculate the time-variation of jet precession and presume it could be accelerated by SMBHB.

Our study indicates that if the rapid acceleration of jet precession is verified, the average separating velocity of the SMBHB drops from $1.46 {\\rm Kpc}$ to $0.80 {\\rm Kpc}$ with a decreasing rate of $1.54 \\times 10^6 {\\rm cm\/s}$ and total evolution timescale $\\tau_{\\rm a} \\approx 7.5 \\times 10^7 {\\rm yr}$."}
{"text":"\nIn this article, we explore a hybrid cellular automaton model that seeks to better understand the complex branching patterns of cell colonies, such as those of bacteria, tumour cells or fungi that exhibit growth under nutrient-limited conditions. The model simulates the inhibition of cell division when a nutrient drops below a certain threshold, in order to study the effect of nutrient consumption rate on the growth of the colony. We observe Eden-like morphologies at low rates and branched morphologies with fractal geometry at higher rates, consistent with previous findings. Through linear stability analysis, we discover a proportional relationship which allows us to measure the stability of the colony's growth, depending on the nutrient penetration depth. The local growth of the colony is further stabilised when the nutrient penetration is higher, as opposed to the low penetration distances for high consumption rates, which leads to unstable, branched growth. Lastly, the result of our dispersion relation was cross-checked with measurements of the average branch width, demonstrating good agreement between the theory and simulation results."}
{"text":"\n\nThis paper investigates the impact of both direct and indirect information feedback from mass media on a simulation model of the propagation of culture. We examine how two different mechanisms of mass media influence (direct and indirect) exert an effect on the dynamics of dissemination of culture. We find that increasing the strength of the message from the mass media increases cultural diversity without regard to the form of the message. However, for weak mass media messages, when combined with agent-agent interaction, cultural homogeneity is more likely. Furthermore, local direct media messages are more effective at producing homogeneity than indirect global mass media messages. Our findings extend on existing knowledge, offering a more detailed explanation of how different forms of media influence influence cultural dynamics."}
{"text":"\nThis paper explores how Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) affects the formation of circumstellar discs around young stars. We use a recently developed method which includes MHD into the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) simulation techniques in evaluating the impact of magnetic fields on the size and mass of discs, as well as their resistance to gravitational instability. We find that introducing magnetic fields during the formation of single stars and binaries significantly reduces the size and mass of the discs, making them more stable. The effect of magnetic tension can also be significant, depending on the alignment of the field relative to the rotation axis, potentially counteracting the magnetic pressure influence on disc formation."}
{"text":"\nIn this study, the effects of the interaction between a magnetic flux tube newly emerging from the convection zone and a previously existing coronal field were investigated. Different orientations of the magnetic flux systems yielded varied results in terms of the amount of reconnection, the associated temperature of the plasma and the height and volume of the emerging flux. The greater the amount of reconnection, the smaller the volume of the remaining tube flux, however the height of the flux, regardless of orientation and reconnection, was found to be the same. Results demonstrated substantial reconnection in the cases of anti-parallel orientations, accompanied by a high temperature plasma and fast velocities extending from the reconnection region. In contrast, when the orientation of the flux systems was more parallel, significantly less reconnection was observed."}
{"text":"\n\nThis article explores the benefits of a new approach to understanding seismic activity that can reduce the noise inherent to Power Spectral Density (PSD) functions. Called the Cumulative Spectral Power (CSP), it utilizes an integration process that reduces the impact of noise on the data. Its maximum value (corresponding to the longest graphed period) provides an estimate of the level of earth vibrations. This author has streamlined the process of PSD generation, making it easy to graph both PSD and CSP. Furthermore, CSP graphing is useful for examining diverse earth dynamics such as teleseismic earthquakes, and its simplicity is a beneficial tool for refining the relevant theories."}
{"text":"\nThe X-ray afterglows of a GRB may originate from interacting with a relativistic wind bubble (RWB) created by a rapidly rotating, highly magnetized postburst object. We examine this source of radiation by numerically exploring the dynamics and radiative properties of RWBs.  We find that two types exist, based on their dominant energy sources - forward shock and reverse shock - and that the resulting light curves typically display a shallow decay phase occurring over a period of 10-100k seconds. As an example, we use this model to fit the X-ray afterglow data of GRBs 060813 and 060814, showing that their respective shallow decays could be the result of a forward-shock- and reverse-shock-dominated bubble. Our results demonstrate that for some early afterglows, the relativistic wind bubble can be the major source of the shallow decay phase."}
{"text":"This article is a revised version that investigates the monotonicity and stability of difference schemes for a type of hyperbolic system of conservation laws with source terms. It is promoted that a nonlinear scheme is stable (and monotone) if the corresponding scheme in variations is stable (and, respectively, monotone). Furthermore, the theorem of Friedrichs (1954) is generalized to be applicable to variational schemes with non-symmetric matrices. A modification of the central Lax-Friedrichs (LxF) scheme is developed to give a second order accurate approximation. This is done through the use of monotone piecewise cubic interpolation for the central schemes and the stability and monotonicity of the modified scheme are further investigated. Test cases are conducted with several conservation laws and the modified scheme is found to be accurate and robust. In addition, an operator-splitting technique is applied to hyperbolic conservation laws with the view to constructing a second order scheme."}
{"text":"\nThis paper introduces a physical strategy to veto different types of instrumental glitches that may appear in the output of interferometric gravitational-wave (GW) detectors. We make use of the knowledge of the linear coupling of different subsystems to the primary output to transfer certain noise from an instrumental channel (X) to the detector output (H). Our proposed methods test the consistency between the bursts in channel X and the transferred channel H by constructing a null-stream, and cross-correlating the two. Our demonstration of the veto efficiency and safety was conducted by 'injecting' instrumental glitches in actual hardware of the GEO 600 detector, as well as performing GW-like hardware injections. Using 5 days of data from the fifth science run of GEO 600, the veto was found to display a high level of efficiency with low chances of accidental veto."}
{"text":"We present a numerical study of the $\\Delta H(M, \\Delta M)$ method for calculating intrinsic switching field distributions of interacting granular magnetic materials such as perpendicular recording media. We employ a 2-dimensional array of symmetric hysterons with intrinsic switching field dispersions of standard deviation $\\sigma$ and ferromagnetic nearest-neighbor interactions $J$. We investigate the accuracy of this methodology for various values of both $\\sigma$ and $J$. Our findings demonstrate that the $\\Delta H(M,\\Delta M)$ method is effective for low $J\/\\sigma$ ratios, while errors develop when the exchange field reaches values comparable to $\\sigma$. This is demonstrated to be linked to non-compliance with data set redundancy, which is a fundamental requirement of the mean-field approximation adopted by the $\\Delta H(M, \\Delta M)$method. We thus conclude that this failure of the $\\Delta H(M,\\Delta M)$ method can be assessed from the data sets themselves through this analysis."}
{"text":"\nThe effective momentum approximation has been developed to take into account the effect of a strongly attractive electromagnetic field of heavy nuclei on electrons in quasi-elastic (e,e') scattering. This method is based on a plane wave Born approximation and considers the negative effects of an attractive nucleus on both the initial and final state electrons by modifying the electron momentum near the nucleus and amplifying the corresponding wave functions. Here, we analyze the focusing behavior of an ensemble of high-energy particles in the electrostatic field of a homogeneously charged sphere using exact solutions of the Dirac equation as well as a highly relativistic limit. Our results indicate that the effective momentum approximation is a valid tool for Coulomb corrections in (e,e') scattering off heavy nuclei at high electron energies and momentum transfer."}
{"text":"\nIn recent years, the $B_d\\to\\pi^+\\pi^-$, $B_s\\to K^+K^-$, $B_d\\to\\pi^\\mp K^\\pm$, and $B_s\\to \\pi^\\pm K^\\mp$ decays have been recognised as powerful strategies to help determine the U-spin angle gamma of the unitarity triangle. This article evaluates the present-day results of these decays from the Tevatron and B-factories, and explores the implications of future ones that will be available from the LHCb. We particularly analyse the accuracy of our knowledge on U-spin-breaking effects, and study the difficulties of disentangling discrete ambiguities. Additionally, we propose ways to exploit the full potential of these channels for the determination of gamma, as well as for the extraction of the width difference $\\Delta\\Gamma_s$ of the $B^0_s$--$\\bar B^0_s$ system. The data favour a value of gamma of $(66.6^{+4.3+4.0}_{-5.0-3.0})^\\circ$ from the $B_d\\to\\pi^+\\pi^-, B_s\\to K^+K^-$ system and $26^\\circ\\leq\\gamma\\leq70^\\circ$ from the $B_d\\to\\pi^\\mp K^\\pm$, $B_s\\to \\pi^\\pm K^\\mp$ case, amongst others.

{"text":"\nThe study of electric charge correlations through the Balance Function approach in A+A collisions at SPS energies of 20\\emph{A} to 158\\emph{A} GeV was conducted in two separate rapidity intervals. In the mid-rapidity domain, the width of the Balance Function was found to narrow in more central collisions. Conversely, no observable tendencies were seen in more forward rapidity intervals. In addition, progressive trends in the normalised width (\\textit{W}) parameter of the Balance Function, with increasing energies up to RHIC and SPS levels, were seen in central Pb+Pb interactions. To conclude, the results were then compared to predictions made by UrQMD and HIJING hadronic string models; however, neither was able to fully explain the observed narrowing of the Balance Function. To contrast, the AMPT model which has a quark-parton stage preceding hadronisation was able to reproduce the observed effects of the Balance Function in more central collisions, indicating that the technique may be sensitive to the time of hadronisation."}
{"text":"\nThis study looks at the theoretical predictions and scaling predictions regarding bottle-brush polymers with a rigid backbone and flexible side chains in good solvent conditions. Self-consistent field calculations and Monte Carlo simulations of a simple lattice model are used in order to assess the validity and applicability of these predictions. Results show that the predicted stretching of side chains is relatively low and they may not accurately apply in typical experimental conditions. Two-component bottle brush polymers with two types (A,B) of side chains that repel each other are also analyzed. Poor solvent conditions are found to create cylinder-like structures and theories suggest Janus Cylinder-type phase separation in this case. Monte Carlo simulations using the pruned-enriched Rosenbluth method (PERM) suggest the lack of phase transition with correlation length that can be controlled by solvent quality. This is explained through an analogy of one-dimensional ferromagnetic models."}
{"text":"This paper investigates the complexity classes QZK and HVQZK, which contain problems that can be solved with a quantum computational zero-knowledge proof system or an honest-verifier quantum computational zero-knowledge proof system, respectively.

Similarly, the classes QPZK, HVQPZK and QSZK of problems solvable with a quantum perfect zero-knowledge proof system, an honest-verifier quantum perfect zero-knowledge proof system, and a quantum statistical zero-knowledge proof system are shown to have the same properties.

{"text":"\nIn this article we show how General Relativity implies the quantum nature of physical phenomena, leading to a string theory where the dynamical weighting of all configurations according to their entropy allows for the selection of a four-dimensional space-time. This entropy-weighted sum thus reduces to a Feynman path integral at large volumes, leading to a highly predictive framework with no adjustable parameters that is compatible with experimentally observed particles and interactions. We further explore the implications of this scenario on cosmology and the primordial universe and show that it is able to produce results in agreement with experimental data and observations, including the computed masses and couplings, CKM matrix elements, cosmological constant and other expansion parameters, etc."}
{"text":"\nThe polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) on large angular scales allows us to make inferences about the evolution of the universe's average ionization during the Epoch of Reionization. Conventionally, interpretation of the polarization spectrum requires the assumption of a fixed functional form for the evolution, like instantaneous reionization. In this paper, a model-independent approach is presented where a small number of principal components are used to encapsulate the effects of reionization on the large-angle E-mode polarization for any reionization history within an adjustable range of redshifts. Applying this method to 3-year WMAP data and simulated future data, two components of the reionization history are constrained. This includes the optical depth, with only slightly higher uncertainty than previous analyses, and a 95% CL upper limit on the contribution from redshifts z>20. Improving polarization sensitivity and foreground modeling can potentially allow for more of the principal components to be measured, allowing for model-independent constraints and detection of signatures of high-redshift reionization."}

Through counting arguments and insight from symplectic analysis, we determine the standard form of pure n-mode Gaussian states and why only states with n<=3 modes can have zero direct correlations between the position and momentum operator. In addition, we create an efficient scheme to create entangled multimode Gaussian states with an amount of optical elements matching the minimal number of locally invariant dimensions. Comparisons are drawn throughout, showing that states without direct correlations between position and momentum operators are on average less entangled than arbitrary pure Gaussian states."}
{"text":"\nUsing the Faint Object Camera and Spectrograph on the Subaru telescope, we have carried out a spectroscopic analysis of LBGs at z~5 in the J0053+1234 field. From the 5 studied candidates, all of which have z' < 25.0 mag, two objects were proven to be at z~5 in correspondence with their Ly alpha emission and the dropped continuum shortward of this feature. Of these two, only one shows noteworthy low-ionised interstellar metal absorptions. Even though the 2 faintest objects, with z' \u2265 25.0 mag, have confirmed to be at z~5, their spectra have strong Ly alpha emission in comparison to the brighter counterparts. In addition to our previously established data on LBGs at z~5 at the Hubble Deep Field - North (HDF-N), we have created a composite spectrum of the UV luminescent, M\u2081\u2084\u2080\u2080 \u2264 -21.5 mag LBGs at z~5 which exhibit weak Ly alpha emission and powerful LIS absorptions, suggesting that these bright sources have reached a hotiosity level of at least 0.1 solar. With the respective IR data on some of our HDF-N sample, we have researched the stellar masses of these bodies. Bearing in mind the metallicity assessed from LIS absorptions, the z~5 LBGs tend to be have lower metallicities than galaxies with equivalent stellar masses at z \\lesssim 2; however, this can be quite uncertain."}
{"text":"\nWe explore a kind of metric-variation f(R) model that brings about an accelerated expansion of the universe without needing a cosmological constant and likewise respects both cosmological and solar-system tests in the confined region of parameter space. Even though the solar-system tests only limit the models in a mild way, the scalar degree of freedom present goes over more than 25 orders of magnitude to make it similar to the general-relativistic expectation in the higher curvature set-up. For these models to be successful, the galactic halo needs to possess a potential deep enough to keep the galaxy operating with high typical curvature even in the presence of a low-curvature global setting. If the local and global environment of f(R) models don't have greater potentials than those asked for in LCDM, then the models exceeding |f_R| >10 ^{-6} will have the galactic center moving towards small curvature during the acceleration epoch. Therefore, for significant displacements from cohesion to take place, it is necessary to make use of cosmological simulations of such f(R) models, as opposed to depending primarily on solar-system tests. Despite demonstrating its applicability to specific f(R) models, we give a nearly model-independent description of the conditions that standard models need to satisfy. Future percent-level linear power spectrum gauging can be utilized to find out if deviations, which take into account both solar-system and galactic assessments, actually exist or not, although this is not able to be known by some cosmologically-oriented measurements."}
{"text":"\nBy using a sample of 23 nearby elliptical galaxies and spiral\/lenticular bulges, it has been found that there is an influential correlation between the mass of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) and the gravitational binding energy of the bulge, as measured by the stellar light profiles. It was revealed that $M_{\\bullet}$ corresponds directly to $E_g^{0.6}$, with a scatter that suggests this is as reliable a predictor as the bulge's velocity dispersion, at least in the case of ellipticals. Even so, alternative $M_{\\bullet}$ predictors such as the gravitational potential and the bulge mass were observed to be weaker when comparing across the entire sample population. With the aid of IFU spectroscopy and I-band photometry by the SAURON group, new mass-to-light ratios were used for some of the galaxies, leading to an energy predictor with an identical slope but with reduced deviation."}
{"text":"\nWe present an alternative approach to traditional perturbation theory, known as Parametric Perturbation Theory (PPT). This method relies upon a basic criterion of simplicity for the problem's observable solutions, enforcing that they be linear in a given, unphysical parameter. The perturbative expansion is then executed in this parameter, rather than in a physical coupling, as with normal perturbation theory. Our method results in a number of non-trivial examples wherein the potentially infinite perturbative series is successfully re-summed, the leading asymptotic (strong coupling) behavior is isolated, and novel predictions for coefficients of the perturbative series are generated. We demonstrate the utility of PPT in a zero-dimensional field theory by uncovering the imaginary part of the solution through analytical continuation to negative couplings. In addition, application of PPT to $\\phi^4$ lattice model 1+1, elastic theory, and the hard sphere gas in two and three dimensions also yields re-summed results, as well as evidence for a branch point at finite coupling which indicates the transition from a stable to a metastable state. Finally, PPT is utilized to make predictions of unknown virial coefficients for a hard sphere gas."}
{"text":"\nBy simulating a model of the Local Group of galaxies, taking into consideration the current distance, velocity and relative masses of the Milky Way and Andromeda -including a comparable amount of diffuse mass- we explore the possible collision between these two galaxies. Results suggest that they are likely to collide in several billion years and the Sun may be relocated away from its current orbit and end up in a tidal tail. There is also a remote chance that it could become gravitationally bound to Andromeda before the final merger. After the merger is complete, the Sun should be scattered to the outskirts of the new galaxy, residing at considerably greater distances (> 30 kpc) from the merger product. This product is comparable to an elliptical galaxy, implying it offers an example of a late-forming elliptical galaxy."}
{"text":"This paper looks at non-leptonic, two-body B decay that end in axial-vector mesons.

We describe the resulting decays B$^-$ to $\\alpha_1^0\\pi^-$, $\\overline{B^0}$ to $\\alpha_1^{\\pm}\\pi^{\\mp}$, $B^-\\to \\alpha_1^-\\overline{K^0}$, $\\overline{B^0}$ to $\\alpha_1^+K^-$, $\\overline{B^0}$ to ${f_1}\\overline{K^0}$,$ B^-\\to {f_1}K^-$, $B^-\\to K_1^-\\eta'$, $B^-\\to {b_1}^-\\overline{K^0}$, and $\\overline{B^0}$ to ${b^+_1}\\pi^-$ to be of the order of $10^{-5}$.

{"text":"This article examines secure broadcasting with multiple antennas over wireless networks. A strong privacy protocol is essential for wireless providers and for enterprise networks, thus the problem of secure communication using a Gaussian broadcast channel is discussed in this paper. This channel allows a multi-antenna transmitter to send independent, confidential messages to two users that can be decoded without interception from outside sources. A Sato-type outer bound is developed, as well as a dirty-paper secure coding scheme and a simplified version with its achievable rate region. Two numerical examples are used to illustrate the outer bound's consistency with the simplified dirty-paper coding secrecy rate region."}
{"text":"\nResearchers have recently been able to observe the effects of Landau Levels (LL) in Dirac Fermions (DF) with the help of low temperature Scanning-Tunnelling-Spectroscopy (STS) on graphite surfaces in fields up to 12 Tesla. This phenomenon has provided evidence for the unusual LL energy sequences which cause an anomalous Quantum-Hall effect seen in both single and bi-layer graphenes. Moreover, the unique zero-energy LL of quantum-relativistic particles were also identified. Surprisingly, these two-dimensional properties could be seen on a bulk graphite sample with a weak interlayer coupling."}
{"text":"\nThis paper details the AMANDA (Antarctic Muon and Neutrino Detector Array) observations from 1997 to 2003 of photon observations from more than 400 Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) in the Northern Hemisphere. This data set has enabled us to set the most robust upper limit to date for muon neutrino emission from GRBs. Taking into account the Waxman-Bahcall spectrum, our flux upper limit comes in at 6.0 x 10^-9 GeV cm^-2 s^-1 sr^-1 at 1 PeV, with 90% of neutrinos situated between 10 TeV and 3 PeV. We discuss the implications of this limit on several existing theoretical models and the anticipatory detection of GRBs by upcoming neutrino telescopes. Additionally, modifications to this analysis are considered for application in other transient point source studies."}
{"text":"\nThrough the use of Spitzer Space Telescope observations, we have analyzed mid-infrared phase variations of three extrasolar planetary systems: HD 209458, HD 179949 and 51 Peg. We found that, at 3.6 micron and 4.5 micron, the uncertainty in relative photometry from one epoch to the next is significantly greater than the photon counting error. For HD 179949, we detected a phase variation which is in phase with the planet's orbit and has a peak-to-trough amplitude of 0.00141(33). This suggests that, if the planet has a radius R_J < R_p < 1.2R_J\u00b2, recirculation of incident stellar energy to its night side is at most 21% at the 1-sigma level. For the other two systems, we set 2-sigma upper limits of 0.0007 for 51 Peg and 0.0015 for HD 209458. With the appropriate assumptions made, the upper limit for HD 209458 translates into a minimal recirculation of 32% of incident stellar energy to its night side, which is consistent with other measurements. These results suggest that different Hot Jupiters may have varying levels of recirculation efficiency."}
{"text":"This paper presents an improved quantum hard-sphere ground-state equation of state to accurately describe the behavior of many-boson and many-fermion systems. Results are based on exact field-theoretic perturbation-theory low-density expansions, appropriately extrapolated to intermediate densities, with ultimate densities suggested by studies of classical hard-sphere systems. The improved equations of state display substantially improved agreement with the best available Green-function and diffusion Monte Carlo simulations for bosons, as well as with ladder, variational Fermi hypernetted chain, and L-expansion data for two-component fermions."}
{"text":"In this article, we carry out detailed calculations of the OZI-forbidden\nnonleptonic decays of orthoquarkonia $J\/\\psi(\\Upsilon)\\to \\pi\\pi,\\rho\\pi$\nthrough leading-twist distribution amplitude.

{"text":"This article explores the science of asymmetric superconductivity in metallic systems using a BCS approximation. We consider a two-band system of fermions with interactions between intra- and inter-bands. The hybridization between the bands is varied and we investigate the instabilities it produces. We find that for inter-band attractive interactions, a normal-superconductor transition is present, as well as a homogenous metastable phase with gapless excitations. In the case of intra-band interactions, the transition from the superconductor to the normal state is continuous, related to a quantum critical point. Results are presented for the situation in which both intra- and inter-band interactions are present."}
{"text":"\nData from Chandra and XMM-Newton were collected around the Super-Soft-Source (SSS) emission phase of the sixth recorded outburst of the recurrent nova RS Oph, 39.7, 54.0 and 66.9 days after outburst. Our evidence shows a period of 35 seconds that originates from the SSS emission, confirmed by resonant absorption lines, as well as collision-excited emission lines from the shock, and He-like intersystem lines. We find systematic wavelength shifts in the lines, suggesting photoionization of oxygen and UV radiation, resulting to a total lightcurve and spectral hardness light curves shifted by 1000 seconds when examined closely. Anomalous He-like f\/i ratios could indicate high plasma densities or the presence of significant UV radiation. Allowing us to believe that the observed emission lines originate from the shock and not from the outer layers of the outflow, and are likely photoexcited, in addition to collisional excitations."}
{"text":"\nThis study investigates the dark energy universe produced from an action affected by loop corrections to Einstein gravity. These curvature corrections, which can go up to $R^4$ order, may vary depending on the kind of (super)string model being examined. In Type II, heterotic, and bosonic strings, we observe different reactions to dark energy. We obtain a successful dark energy solution for the bosonic string, while the other two theories do not create realistic dark energy universes. A thorough investigation of the dynamical stability of the de-Sitter solution is provided for the case of a bosonic string. Additionally, an algorithm is given to construct a de-Sitter solution for the low-energy (super)string effective action. Moreover, if the higher-curvature coefficients fluctuate with the dilaton, we explore a prescription to build the theory from the universe expansion history."}
{"text":"This article discusses the synthesis, magneto transport characteristics, and magnetization of polycrystalline La2\/3Ca1\/3MnO3:Agx\/Inx composites with x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4. The temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) near the ferromagnetic (FM) transition is observed to be greatly enhanced by Ag doping, leading to a maximum TCR of 15% for Ag (0.4) sample which is an order of magnitude higher than with the pristine sample. The FM transition temperature (TFM) is also slightly increased. Magneto-resistance (MR) was found to be maximum at TFM. The improved grains size of the LCMO:Agx composites is theorized to account for increased TCR, TFM and MR above room temperature. In contrast, the LCMO:Inx composites behaved in an exactly opposite manner, resulting in decreased TFM and TCR compared to the pristine LCMO compound. It was also seen that the grains morphology of LCMO:Inx was inferior to the pristine LCMO."}
{"text":"\nRecently, methods for the reconstruction of stochastic differential equations from measured data sets have been developed [e.g. Siegert et al., Physics Letters A 243, 275 (1998); Hurn et al., Journal of Time Series Analysis 24, 45 (2003)]. For their efficient application, Markov properties are generally required, which may be violated on small scales due to physical effects. Through this article, we propose that measurement noise such as uncorrelated measurement and discretization errors may also disrupt Markov properties of an underlying Markov processes. This gives cause for hope that limitations on small scales might not be derived from intrinsic dynamics of the process, but may rather lie in the presence of artificial noise sources. Thus, the measurement noise can be more reliably managed than the dynamics of the underlying process."}
{"text":"This paper examines the effect of the ion clearing electrodes in the DAFNE electron ring. We analyze the theoretical models and the experimental data concerning the contribution of ICE to the machine broad-band impedance. We observe that these electrodes lead to several negative consequences for the overall performance of the collider. We report on our investigation of the ICE wake field and impedance calculations, as well as on the effects of the ICE removal from the electron's wiggler sections. This resulted in an improvement of the beam dynamics, luminosity and overall performance of the collider."}
{"text":"In this article, we establish a rate adaptation for cognitive radio to operate under the presence of interference from primary spectrum user. We focused on achieving an optimal spectral efficiency of the secondary system. As such, the secondary receiver considered a two-user multiple access channel, which includes both the secondary and the primary transmitter. For efficient operation, we proposed Opportunistic Interference Cancellation (OIC) to decode the primary signal. To this extent, we formulated an achievable data rate in the secondary system. If a decodeable primary signal is available, we further applied superposition coding to obtain the maximal possible rate. We also explored power allocation in the secondary system with multiple channels and determined the optimal power amounts through intercepted water-filling. Our results show a notable improvement in the rate obtained through OIC."}
{"text":"\nUsing a novel NpT sampling technique, this work examines the surface free energy of systems with continuous and discontinuous potentials, such as Lennard--Jones, Square Well and a bead-spring polymer model. We also determine the interface tension of freely jointed tangent hard sphere chains for a variety of chain lengths and densities. Results are then compared with three theoretical approaches - Scaled Particle Theory, the Yu and Wu density functional theory and an analytical approximation of the same. Our results demonstrate that the Yu and Wu density functional theory and the analytical approximation yield good agreement with the simulations, while SPT only gives qualitative results."}
{"text":"\nIn 1995, the young star OO Serpentis abruptly went into outburst and began to steadily fade. This event was similar to both FU Orionis-style outbursts and EX Lupi-style outbursts, but is largely unprecedented in infrared observation. To better analyze the eruption and its timeline, a multi-wavelength study was conducted with the Infrared Space Observatory, archival Spitzer observations, and other ground-based observation between 2004 and 2006. It was found that the outburst increased brightness across the infrared spectrum initially, with a subsequent wavelength-independent fading that continues from 2004 to the present day. As it fades, it is unlikely to regain pre-eruptive levels until 2011. OO Serpentis has a much shorter timescale than FUors, but a longer one than EXors. The star may harbour a circumstellar disc, an accretion disc and a surrounding envelope-evidence for which is seen in the spectral energy distribution. These observations suggest that OO Serpentis is a young class I object, less than 100,000 years old. The results of the study raise further questions about the viscosity in the disc, as OO Serpentis appears to be an outlier of the traditional FUor instances."}
{"text":"\nWe analyze the possible deviations from the unitarity of the Quantum Field Theory of coupled, non-degenerate fermions which occur when the elements of the mixing matrix take account of the fermion mass splittings. We demonstrate that the three CKM mixing angles, together with a neutrino-like mixing pattern in which theta_{23 } is maximal and tan(2 theta_{12}) = 2, can be employed to verify that neutrally charged mass eigenstates are universally diagonal with the same amount of violation as the non-diagonal ones. Furthermore, two solutions for the third neutrino mixing angle meet the imposed limit sin^2(theta_{13}) < 0.1: theta_{13} = +\/- 5.7 10^-3, and theta 13 = +\/- 0.2717. These results demonstrate that the vicinity of the Standard Model includes certain patterns which might be indicative of physics beyond the Standard Model."}
{"text":"\nHerein, we explore the transport and magnetic properties of hybrid Ni80Fe20\/Nb\/Ni80Fe20 trilayers and Ni80Fe20\/Nb bilayers to check for the presence of a magnetoresistance effect. We report a magnetoresistance peak of 1000 %, two orders of magnitude larger than the normal-state values of 0.6 % for the trilayer. Contrastingly, for the bilayer the peak is modest (70 %). The magnetization data indicate that below its superconducting transition temperature, Nb is magnetized by the external field in such a way that it attains a transverse magnetization under the influence of the outer Ni80Fe20 layers. We propose a mechanism that is reliant on the magnetostatic coupling of the outer Ni80Fe20 layers due to their multidomain magnetic structure and stray fields naturally generated through the whole surface near coercivity. Atomic force microscopy allows us to assess the interface roughness which could also increase such magnetostatic coupling. The lack of a second Ni80Fe20 layer in the bilayer is shown to prevent such a magnetostatic coupling, and thus, the magnetoresistance peak is not as high."}
{"text":"\nThis article investigates the accuracy of different models that predict the attenuation of light due to resonant scattering with intergalactic neutral hydrogen. The evolutionary trends of the mean cosmic flux decrement, D_A, are examined by analyzing published observations and our own measurements for 25 quasars located between redshifts 2.71 and 5.41. Data is obtained by fitting a power-law to the continuum redward of the Lya emission line, which is then extrapolated to the region blueward of it, which is strongly impacted by absorption from intervening HI absorbers. Numerical simulations are used to calculate the redshift evolution of D_A, taking into account Lya Forest and Lyman limit systems distributed along the line-of-sight. Our results suggest that the distribution of D_A is lognormally distributed, which implies 1 - D_A is Gaussian distributed. Additionally, our findings demonstrate that this result is independent of form of input fluctuations, and is not significantly affected by high-column density absorbers."}
{"text":"This article examines the development of stochastic interacting particle systems away from equilibrium. It looks at various models of lattice gases, and explores commonalities between them that emerge at a macroscopic level. It focuses on approaches that investigate large fluctuations in stationary states of open systems, and its outcome is a theory that connects the non-equilibrium thermodynamics to the transport coefficients via a variational principle. This principle results in a Hamilton-Jacobi equation for the non-equilibrium free energy. Through detailed introduction to the microscopic dynamics involved and a discussion of the macroscopic properties, the paper aims to illustrate the implications of the equation and introduce new developments."}
{"text":"\nIn this article, we analyze the expanding Universe and the related energy problems. To begin, we develop a mathematical model for the Universe's growth starting with the Big Bang. Then, we address issues regarding the invariance of mechanical and physical laws when dealing with spatial frames exchanges. To demonstrate the (theoretical) existence of a variable metric, which depends on time and abides by a simplified Einstein equation, allowing all ordinary trajectories to be geodesics, we utilize classical Galileo-Newtonian space time relations in addition to approved physical new applications such as the Covariance Principle, Mach Principle, and the Einstein Equivalence Principle. We present a new cosmological model of the dynamic Universe as $(U(t))_{t\\geq 0}=(B_e(O,t),g_t)_{t\\geq 0}$ alongside the cosmological metric $g_t$ which is at a current time $t$ totally determined by the mass energy distribution $E_t(X)$ on $B_e(O,t)$. Furthermore, we explore the phenomenon of blackholes and prove that the overall cosmological energy distribution $E_t(X)$ accords with a wave equation with solutions characterized by pseudo-frequencies subject to the Dirichlet problem on the unit ball $B_e(O,1)$ and the Laplace-Beltrami Operator -$\\Delta$. With this, we can ascertain that all Newtonian and classical physical laws are applicable in classical circumstances, and all core tenets of Modern Physics remain valid without utilizing the second postulate of special relativity or the uncertainty principle."}
{"text":"\nThis study investigates the interplay between the properties of long and short X-ray bursts from IGR  J17254-3257, a newly-discovered low-luminosity neutron star. Utilizing contemporaneous INTEGRAL and XMM-Newton data, its bolometric flux was discovered to have a value of 1.1x10^-10 erg\/cm2\/s. This corresponds to a luminosity of about 8.4x10^35 erg\/s and an accretion rate of 7x10^-11 solar masses per year when the source is placed at the canonical distance of 8 kpc. The nuclear burning regime of the star is seen to be located between pure He burning and a mixture of H\/He burning. It is suggested that the long burst observed is due to an accumulation of a thick He layer, while the short burst is a premature He burning at a lower rate triggered by hydrogen."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate the potential use of quantum-like (QL) mathematical formalism, as typically used in physics, for game theory. Specifically, we focus on games with extensive form, where the order of actions of players is of particular importance. As an example, we study the 'Wine Testing' game. Through the use of complex probability amplitudes ('game's wave function') and noncommutative operators, players' probabilistic behavior can be modeled even when there is incomplete information regarding previous actions of other players. In the case of a game with three players, it is possible to violate Bell's inequality. We utilize contextual probability theory for describing the probabilistic behavior in this case, supplemented by the frequency definition of probability."}
{"text":"We explore the implications of a noncommutative version of the classic Bohnenblust-Spitzer identity for Rota-Baxter algebras, which encompasses the process of renormalization as found in Connes-Kreimer's Hopf algebra of renormalization. We show that, in a manner analogous to how the commutative setting relies on the theory of symmetric functions, the noncommutative setting has functional identities which derive from the theory of noncommutative symmetric functions. The key role played by the Lie Idempotents, with special attention to the Dynkin Idempotent and the perturbative renormalization pro-unipotent groups, are discussed at length."}
{"text":"\nThis article examines the method of History-Restricted Marginal Structural Models (HRMSMs), a novel way of defining causal parameters from longitudinal data which is often better suited to public health research, or at least more applicable, than MSMs \\citejoffe,feldman. The idea behind HRMSMs is to analyze the effects of a treatment on the outcome of a study based on a shorter, pre-defined history of exposure rather than a full treatment history from the beginning of the study until the outcome is recorded. We introduce the formal statistical framework of HRMSMs as well as consistent estimators of HRMSM parameter assumptions: Inverse Probability of Treatment Weighting (IPTW), G-Computation, and Double Robust (DR). We show that the assumptions common to MSMs - existence of counterfactuals, consistency, time-ordering, and sequential randomization assumptions - are also eligible for the identification and consistent estimation of HRMSM parameters. This improves computational tractability and mitigates statistical power issues when designing longitudinal studies."}
{"text":"\nWe combined a selection of X-ray starforming galaxies from thewell-studied Chandra Deep Field South (CDFS) area with ultraviolet and infrared data from GALEX and GOODS-Spitzer in order to study the effect of galaxy evolution on various star formation rate (SFR) tracers. Our results showed good agreement between the extinction-corrected SFR(UV) and SFR(X), validating the use of X-ray luminosities as a reliable indicator of current star formation activity. We identified multiple objects with SFR(X) exceeding SFR(UV) by an order of magnitude, indicating possible obscured AGN. Additionally, our data showed a single object with SFR(X) much lower than expected based on its SFR(UV). We suggest this discrepancy may indicate an early transient phase, prior to the formation of most massive X-ray binaries. This could be used to isolate powerful yet recently initiated star formation events associated with young supernova explosions."}
{"text":"This article studies the thermodynamic aspects of lasers. The equilibrium of the open system is determined by two thermodynamic forces, the incoming pumping power and the emitted light. The logistic map is used to express this equilibrium, which reveals pitchfork bifurcation diagrams when graphed. As the pumping force increases, there is a corresponding decrease in the relative populations of the ground levels and the lasing branches. An interesting observation of this model is the spectrum of up and down transitions between the branches beyond the bifurcation point. With just two transition types (up and down) of two-level lasers, it is impossible to practically bring into effect. Multilevel lasers are discussed by introducing the concept of thermodynamic activity to the emitting atoms. By doing so, the concept of population inversion is pushed beyond the scope of spontaneous transitions between levels, which creates a chance for the system to function as a laser."}
{"text":"\nThis paper presents a quantitative analysis of word distribution in two Ukrainian fables, 'Mykyta the Fox' and 'Abu-Kasym's Slippers', by Ivan Franko.

It is observed that the text sizes are sufficient enough to identify statistical properties, with an exponent of $\\alpha\\simeq 1$ in the region of rank variable r = 20\u20133000, consolidating the quality of the texts used. Furthermore, the Simon model is applied to assess non-asymptotic properties of word distributions. Additionally, the representation of language networks is discussed, with comparison of their characteristics, showing that the Ukrainian language network is a strongly correlated scale-free small world. The research findings may be useful for further elucidations of language evolution."}
{"text":"We investigate structure formation in the context of massive gravity which violates Lorentz symmetry. The equations governing this system produce an unusual term with an equation of state w = -1 \/ (3 gamma) for the Friedman equation. Additionally, perturbations above the Friedmann background contain an extra contribution that is proportional to a non-propagating scalar mode. Depending on the value of gamma, this mode may or may not be dynamical. For gamma between -1 and 0, the extra terms produce perturbations that grow slower than expected, making the model compatible with observations. To fully elucidate whether this model is experimentally viable, the values of the scalar mode theta(x) must be evaluated at the beginning of the radiation-dominated epoch."}
{"text":"\nUsing new multicolor photo-polarimetry and polarization data from previous studies, we analyze stars located behind the Southern Coalsack, Chamaeleon I, Musca, rho Ophiuchus, R CrA, and Taurus clouds. We find that there is a linear correlation between the wavelength of maximum polarization (lambda_max) and the radiation environment of the grains. We show that once Far-Infrared emission data is taken into account, the large scatter in previous measurements of lambda_max vs. A_V is due to certain A_V measurements not representing the extinction seen by grains being probed. The slopes derived by the individual clouds in lambda_max versus A_V are consistent with a common value, while their zero intercepts scale with the ratio of total-to-selective extinction (R_V) of each domain. We suggest that alignment is driven by the radiation field, and postulate that the scatter seen in the data is partially due to increasing plasma damping, caused by X-rays from Young Stellar Objects, present in the clouds."}
{"text":"\nThis paper proposes an innovative model for Multi-cellular Developmental Design. The cells are set up in a 2D grid and share chemicals with their adjacent cells as the growth cycle unfolds. A Neural Network (the genotype) regulates the amount and type of chemicals each cell releases, using neighboring cell chemicals as input. There is no predetermined limit to the number of growth cycles, as the phenotype only emerges when the cycle stops. The NEAT algorithm is utilized to train and optimize the controller, while each cell only gains information from its neighbors. To prove its validity, the model is tested with the 'flags' problem where a specific 2D pattern must be produced. The outcomes were favorable when compared to a global information direct regression model. In addition, the resulting multi-cellular entities are near-flawless in terms of self-healing properties."}
{"text":"\nThis research provides insight into the possibility of departures from Newtonian gravity in cosmology using clustering of galaxies as an observation. Using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, a model including an additional Yukawa-like term is tested utilizing two methods, 2nd-order perturbation theory and N-body simulations. The methods allow for nonlinear evolution to be studied. From our simulations, mock galaxy catalogs with constraints on the amplitude and length scale of the Yukawa-like term are derived, with the results of the power spectrum being consistent with our earlier work. Additionally, if nonlinear biasing is adopted, the bispectrum of the SDSS galaxies indicates tight constraints on the ratio of quadratic to linear biasing coefficients, b_2\/b_1, to be between -0.4 and 0.3 in the modified Newtonian model."}

{"text":"\nUsing the ACIS detector aboard the Chandra X-ray Observatory, we have identified 128 X-ray sources in the mysterious high-latitude star forming region CG12. This revelation of over 50 T-Tauri stars and one new embedded protostar is substantially larger than the pre-existing few intermediate-mass and two protostellar members formerly reported. Most of the X-ray-emitting stars have masses between 0.2-0.7 solar masses and a small portion exhibit K-band excess from newly forming protoplanetary disks. Our X-ray properties also support an independent distance estimate which is consistent with CG12's location above 200pc above the Galactic plane. An estimated star formation efficiency of 15-35% indicates an ongoing star formation process in the region's molecular cores, with a photometrically determined median age of around 4 million years, though this age has a wide range between less than 1-20 million years. The stellar age and spatial distributions of CG12 are not in orthodox agreement with a simple radiation driven implosion (RDI) model, suggesting either that CG12 is an unusually immense shocked cloud, or has been subjected to a series of triggering and erosion episodes. Additionally, a previously ignored group of B-type stars northwest of CG12 may be the remnants of an OB association that may have launched several supernovas and generated multiple shockwaves and abrasive episodes to the globule over a 15 -30 million year period. HD120958, its most luminous component, may be the source of the current RDI shock in the CG12 region."}
{"text":"This article explores bright-dark vector solitons observed in quasi-one-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensates composed of the $m_{F}=+1,-1,0$ spinor components. To obtain approximate bright-dark soliton solutions, a multiscale expansion technique was used to reduce the complex system of coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations to a completely integrable Yajima-Oikawa system. Numerical simulations of the full system demonstrated properties consistent with solitons, such as undistorted propagation and quasi-elastic collisions. In the presence of a parabolic trap, the bright component is guided by the dark one, allowing small-amplitude vector solitons to perform harmonic oscillations of frequency $\\omega\/ \\sqrt{2}$. The effects of increased depth and spin-dependent interactions on the vector solitons were also investigated."}
{"text":"\nThe present study investigates the nature and characteristics of large planetary embryos and planetesimals present in thin debris disks found around three sources (AU Microscopii, Beta Pictoris and Fomalhaut). We analyse the opacity and thickness of the disks, the surface brightness profiles, and the requirements for the size of the largest bodies these disks contain. It is determined that the maximum radius of these particles appears to be 5, 180, and 70 km respectively for the three disks, and that bodies with radius of 1000km and with surface density of 0.01 g\/cm^2 would be necessary to explain the thickness of the disks assuming that they are heated by gravitational stirring. Further comparison of the densities of the two sizes implicates that the size distribution amongst the bodies with radius more than 10km is flatter than the one observed in the Kuiper belt. For AU Mic's disk, the shallowest size distribution for the bodies with highest radius is suggested, indicating that the planet may contain embryos resulting from runaway growth."}
{"text":"\nThe tradeoff between data rate and error rate is encapsulated in the concept of diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT). While this tradeoff has been characterized asymptotically (in SNR) for Independent and Identically Distributed (i.i.d.) Rayleigh fading channel by Zheng and Tse [1], this paper makes an effort to extend the asymptotic analysis to a broad class of channels, including those which are not necessarily Rayleigh fading. Using the existing results of the asymptotic outage capacity distributions,this paper explores the finite SNR DMT which is expected to be a more accurate representation than its asymptotic counterpart. Moreover, the definition of multiplexing gain affects the speed of convergence of the finite SNR DMT to its asymptotic version. The outline of conditions under which the asymptotic DMT converges to the finite SNR one are especially useful when the multiplexing gain is defined via the mean (ergodic) capacity, converging at feasible SNR values. Furthermore, this paper highlights the effects of scenarios such as correlation and power imbalance, which are expected to reduce the diversity gain for correlated keyhole channels. All these scenarios are not captured by the SNR-asymptotic DMT of Zheng and Tse but are elucidated by the size-asymptotic DMT."}
{"text":"\nThis paper describes the detection of an X-ray source at a distance of 19 kpc from the radio hotspot of the quasar 4C 74.26. Observations from XMM-Newton and Chandra revealed the displacement between the radio and X-ray hotspots. We analyze the optical data from the Liverpool Telescope to confirm that the X-ray emission is authentic and not from a background source. Two possible explanations are considered for this X-ray hotspot: synchrotron or inverse-Compton emission. If the emission is synchrotron, the particle accelerations occur at this hotspot and the offset is due to differential momentum in colliding jets. If the emission is inverse-Compton, then the jet must be highly relativistic (Gamma greater than or equal to 2) at distances up to 800 kpc. With an X-ray luminosity greater than any hotspot previously detected, our findings suggest intriguing possibilities for understanding the complex structure of jets in quasars."}
{"text":"This research presents an analytical approach for studying the optimal power distribution for the V-BLAST algorithm. It is based on the comparison of average total and individual block error rates with compact closed-form approximations. Additionally, high and low SNR approximations are used to evaluate the SNR gain of optimization. The measure of robustness of the algorithm is also taken into account, suggesting a pre-set power allocation as a cost-effective alternative. This power allocation solution implements only a minor performance loss over the entire practical SNR range."}
{"text":"\nThis paper investigates two distinct aspects of the min-sum (MS) algorithm, one of the predominant message passing approaches. The first is to analyze the stability condition that underlies the MS algorithm, which is found to be comparable to the sum-product (also known as BP) algorithm. The second is to optimize the degree distribution of an LDPC code for common irregular ensembles. Results show that the threshold R rate is limited distinctly from the Shannon threshold with a gap around 1dB for a rate 0.3 code and 0.4dB for a rate of 0.9. Furthermore, an upgraded MS algorithm that demodulates the output of the check node with a scaling factor of 1\/\u03b1 was tested with a constant of 1.25. Despite this, a noticeable gap in rate to capacity was still visible with figures varying from 0.75 dB to 0.2 dB as the rate shifts between 0.3 to 0.9. This paper concludes by posing several challenging questions concerning the MS algorithm that need further research."}
{"text":"\n\nMotivated by experiments on BaCuSi2O6, this study examines the magnetic excitations and transitions in layered quantum dimer magnets when considering two scenarios: (A) one dimer per unit cell and complete inter-layer frustration; and (B) an enlarged cell with inequivalent layers, either with or without perfect frustration. Calculations of the material's low-temperature magnetic characteristics based on a generalized bond-operator method reveal critical behavior that is three-dimensional at the lowest temperature, albeit with a tiny crossover scale. In the second case, it is demonstrated that the magnetic order can be interpreted as stemming from two condensates, and that complete frustration weakens the proximity influence. Consequently, the ordering transition typically becomes separated, leading to observable effects. Comparison with the available data indicates that BaCuSi2O6 likely implements scenario (B) with distinct layers and partially frustrated interactions, supplemented by an additional modulation of inter-layer couplings along the c-axis."}
{"text":"\nThis article examines the impact of a moving parton and the saturation of gluon distribution in the quark-gluon plasma on jet quenching or transport parameter $\\hat{q}$. We analyze the dependence of $\\hat{q}$ on jet energy when related to the Debye screening mass $\\mu_D^2$ and find results for both a conformal gauge theory and for QCD. We investigate the extraction of shear viscosity $\\eta$ from transport parameters of thermal partons as well as derive limits on said parameters. This leads to a lower bound on the ratio of shear viscosity-to-entropy density that is in agreement with the proposed value of $\\eta\/s\\geq 1\/4\\pi$. Additionally, we comment on the implications these findings have for studying jet quenching at two major particle colliders."}
{"text":"We report K-band imaging of observed strong CaII absorption line systems in galaxies at redshifts of 0.7 to 1.1; three of these systems have been confirmed as Damped Lyman-alpha systems. Analysis of these fields reveals an abundance of luminous galaxies located within 50kpc from the line of sight of the absorbers, which contrasts to their prevalence in comparison with field galaxies. It appears that these galaxies have a luminosity-dependent cross-section that is stronger than the one established for MgII absorbers. The impact parameter of the galaxies associated with the absorbers is 24kpc, resulting in a filling factor of only 10%. It is difficult to discern the physical origin of this CaII absorption, but possibilities range from extended disks of luminous galaxies to outflows or tidal debris from smaller galaxies."}
{"text":"\nThis paper presents two experiments that measure the difference in the magnitude of the Casimir force between a gold coated sphere and two types of semiconductor plates--one with different dopant densities and the other that undergoes an insulator-metal phase transition with increasing temperature. We report on the current status of our interferometer-based variable temperature apparatus which has been developed to carry out the experiments. We also discuss the precision of the measurements that can be made and the theoretical issues affecting their results. The first experiment proposes the direct high-precision measurement of the difference of the Casimir forces between the sphere and sections of the patterned plate, or the difference of the equivalent pressures between Au and patterned parallel plates with both static and dynamic techniques. The second experiment plans to measure the Casimir force between the same sphere and a VO${}_2$ film with the aim of providing better insight into the application of the Lifshitz theory at nonzero temperature to real materials. When combined, these experiments open up new possibilities in nanotechnology."}
{"text":"\nThrough a multi-wavelength analysis of AKARI\/IRC monitor field towards the North Ecliptic Pole, we have identified 72 sources emitting at 18um and 25 galaxies with redshifts above 0.5. We applied a SED radiative transfer model to the optical-MIR SEDs of these sources and derived photometric redshifts. We found that the flux dip between the PAH 7.7 and 11.2um emission feature is recognizable in the observed SEDs of galaxies at z~1, allowing for the construction of unique samples of ULIRGs at z~1. This pilot study implies the likelihood of obtaining various insights from the NEP-Deep and Wide surveys, such as the difference in SEDs between high- and low-z ULIRGs, along with a large variation of the PAH inter-band strength ratio at high redshifts."}
{"text":"\nIn this article, we extend the isolated horizon framework beyond Einstein gravity to include black holes in higher-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) gravity. We introduce a covariant phase space in arbitrary dimensions that permits us to derive the relevant first law. The horizon entropy of a weakly isolated and non-rotating black hole is defined as $\\mathcal{S}=(1\/4G_{D})\\oint_{S^{D-2}}\\bm{\\tilde{\\epsilon}}(1+2\\alpha\\mathcal{R})$, where $S^{D-2}$ is the $(D-2)$-dimensional cross-section of the horizon with area form $\\bm{\\tilde{\\epsilon}}$ and Ricci scalar $\\mathcal{R}$, $G_{D}$ is the $D$-dimensional Newton's constant and $\\alpha$ is the Gauss-Bonnet parameter. This expression matches other predictions acquired through the Euclidean and Noether charge methods."}
{"text":"\nWe examine the dynamics of utilizing a subsystem of interest in continuous-time, Markovian quantum systems, which can be applicable in quantum information processing. We clarify the notion of invariance and noiseless subsystem for these systems, under different assumptions for model-parameter and initial-state variations. Additionally, an attractive quantum subsystem is introduced, with sufficient conditions for its existence provided. We analyze how output-feedback Markovian control can be employed for pure state-stabilization and noiseless-subspace generation, including explicit results for stabilizing semigroups and noiseless subspaces in finite-dimensional Markovian systems."}
{"text":"\nIn this study, we analyze the Swift\/XRT data of 53 long GRBs, and find multiple physical origins in the shallow decay segment of their light curves. The log-normal or normal distributions of the isotropic X-ray energy (E_{iso, X}) show a linear correlation with the prompt gamma-ray energy, but a steeper photon spectrum than those of X-ray flashes. No notable spectral evolution is identified from this segment to the follow-up one. The data is generally consistent with a constant injection luminosity during this period, and a positive correlation of E_{iso, X} with the epoch of transition t_b also supports this. The optical light curves of 13 well-sampled bursts demonstrate varied behavior; for 6 of them, an achromatic break occurs around t_b, but the other 7 either lack a break or don't show one at this time. This implies that the origin of optical and X-ray emission may not be identical in a subset of cases. Additionally, 4 of the GRBs present sharp drops immediately after t_b, which conflicts with any external shock model and hints to a intrinsic origin requiring a lasting central engine. Our analysis indicates the existence of diverse physical origins in the shallow decay phase of GRBs."}
{"text":"\nThe mass of a black hole can be estimated from the X-ray emission of its accretion disk, such as its temperature and normalization, subject to certain corrections for high accretion rates. This paper describes models for two accretion states: the Very High State, with increased disk temperatures and lower inner disk radii, and the Ultraluminous X-ray State which features cooler disks with larger radii. A 'standard disk' is proposed to dominate radiative output for radii between the innermost stable orbit and a transition radius proportional to the accretion rate in Eddington units. Non-thermal processes are then thought to power the disk within this region. Characteristics of these sources in a luminosity-temperature plot are given, as well as a suggestion that ULXs may represent black holes of 50-100 Solar Masses on a high-accretion rate up to 20 Eddington rates."}
{"text":"\nIn this article, we analyze the dynamic scaling properties of a one-dimensional Burgers equation with the addition of conserved degrees of freedom. We achieve this by implementing lattice gas models that maintain number conservation of momentum quanta of both positive and negative charges. Taking the Arndt-Heinzel-Rittenberg (AHR) process as the base model, we discover that it follows a Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) type scaling, as seen through its two-part correlation functions in time. We also prove that this scaling is a result of perfect screening of fluctuation in the stationary state, where two-part correlations evidently decrease exponentially on a coarse-grained scale. A proof of this phenomenon is presented with the help of a matrix product structure of the stationary state, which also suggests the presence of a topological invariant. In accordance to the KPZ type scaling, the two Burgers equations decouple from each other upon perfect screening at large length scales."}
{"text":"\nWe have uncovered a new Milky Way satellite, located within 1.5 degrees of the existing Bo{\\\"o}tes dwarf, during a survey of the southern sky for faint galaxy satellites. A sophisticated data mining algorithm was used to detect the stellar overdensity and verify that it does not correspond to any previously catalogued object. Analysis of the color-magnitude diagram for the region with stellar population synthesis models suggests that the new object has a total magnitude of $M_{V}\\sim-3.1\\pm1.1$ mag and a half-light radius of $r_{h}=4'.1\\pm1'.6$ ($72\\pm28$ pc). This places it in a previously empty forty to one-hundred parsec void between globular clusters and dwarf galaxies, occupied by only one other Milky Way satellite- Coma Berenices."}
{"text":"  This study focuses on the average kinetic energy of the heavy quark within the context of the $\\Lambda_b$ baryon, as determined by the Bethe-Salpeter equation formulated in the framework of the $SU(2)_{f} \\times SU(2)_{s}$ heavy quark symmetries of QCD. This quantity, $\\mu_\\pi^2$, can be extracted from experimental data and is important since it contributes to the inclusive semileptonic decays of $\\Lambda_b$ in the calculation of Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix elements $V_{ub}$ and $V_{cb}$. Through our research, we conclude that $\\mu_\\pi^2$ for $\\Lambda_b$ ranges between $0.25-0.95GeV^2$, all depending on the light diquark mass and the interactions between the heavy quark and the light diquark. This result is consistent with the value of $\\mu_\\pi^2$ for $\\Lambda_b$ derived through the heavy quark effective theory from the experimental value of $\\mu_\\pi^2$ for the $B$ meson."}
{"text":"We examine the NMR experiments done on the k-(ET)2X organic materials and demonstrate that above temperatures of 50 K, the antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations are present and the M-MMP phenomenological spin fluctuation model describes the data well. Near the Mott insulating phase, the Korringa ratio becomes much greater than one and suggests vertex corrections or spatial correlations are being neglected. Below 50 K, the Knight shift and Korringa ratio decline, signaling the opening of a pseudogap akin to that observed in the underdoped cuprate superconductors. We suggest experiments to prove the presence of a pseudogap and explore potential methods of closing it altogether."}
{"text":"\nIn this article, we look into the relationship between the quantum cohomology of a flag variety, QH^*(G\/P), and the homology of the affine Grassmannian, H_*(Gr_G), where G is a simple and simply-connected complex algebraic group, and P \\subset G is a parabolic subgroup. We prove an unpublished result of D. Peterson which states that the quantum cohomology of G\/P is, after localization, a quotient of the homology. This establishes an equivalence between the quantum and homology affine Schubert titles. Additionally, we also consider Mihalcea's equivariant quantum Chevalley formula for QH^*(G\/B), and find connections between the quantum Bruhat graph and the Bruhat order of the affine Weyl group. Consequently, formulae for affine Schubert homology classes in terms of quantum Schubert polynomials have been obtained. Further applications have also been provided in quantum cohomology. Finally, our findings have been extended to the torus-equivariant setting."}
{"text":"\nBy looking at early survey data from AKARI's North Ecliptic Pole Deep (NEP-Deep) Survey across 6 wavelengths from 2.5 to 11 microns, this study examines the nature of infrared sources at 11 microns. Taking advantage of the 11 micron band's capability of detecting star forming galaxies between low to medium redshifted distances, 71 sources were selected by their 11 micron AB magnitudes equal or brighter than 18.5 (251 microJy), with 90% magnitude completeness. Through SED modelling and other analysis, it was found that the majority (~68%) of these 11 micron bright sources were star forming galaxies between 0.2 and 0.7 with $L_{IR} ~ 10^{10}$ -- $10^{12} L_{\\odot}$, while four AGNs located at various redshifts were also detected. Moreover, dissimilar SED's of the main sample have been studied, including a brown dwarf candidate, a steep power-law source, and a flat spectrum object."}
{"text":"\nThis paper analyzes the resonant state of open quantum systems from the perspective of outgoing momentum flux. It is demonstrated that by utilizing an expanding integration volume, the number of particles in a resonant state is conserved, whereas it would normally decay exponentially when using a fixed volume. In addition, two numerical methods are presented: one used to locate resonance poles in the complex energy plane, while the other is a numerical trick to calculate the time evolution of the resonant state in a confined spatial region. It is noted that the wave function of the resonant state can diverge from the scattering potential, which previously made it difficult to track its time evolution numerically in a finite area. The methods introduced in this paper offer efficient solutions to these issues."}
{"text":"\nThis paper explores the utilization of neural networks toestimate the residual life of both machines and components, assessing the potential benefit of including condition-monitoring data when making such predictions. To validate their usage for this application, two datasets were tested and compared. The first, taken from experiments conducted in a laboratory with hydraulic actuators, revealed a variation in the average prediction error of the various neural networks being examined of between 431 and 841 seconds, with each test piece displaying a typical life of 8,971 seconds. The second dataset came from pumps in an operational plant, which exhibited reliability degradation despite undergoing repair, allowing the multi-layer perceptron neural networks and general regression neural networks to attain an error rate within 11.1% of one another. These results demonstrate that neural networks can be effectively utilized to determine the residual life of machines and components, and further, that condition-based data can enhance the predictive capability of these networks."}
{"text":"\nThis article looks into how users' subjective perceptions of products can be measured using methods such as multidimensional scaling, semantic differential and preference mapping. These methods help to chart a perceptual space and give a comprehensive understanding of user preferences, which are key considerations in product design.

Advantages and drawbacks of the techniques are discussed, as well as potential implications for the marketing and industrial design fields."}
{"text":"This investigation examines the hypothesis that the Debye-H\\\"uckel theory and the systematic high-temperature expansion yield an adequate representation in the range of small, still strictly positive $\\beta>0$ values. The paper studies the large-distance equivalent of a two-dimensional Coulomb gas comprised of pointlike $+\/-$ unit charges interacting through a logarithmic potential which is equivalent to an integrable sine-Gordon field model. Applying a 'form factor' method to ascertain the exact asymptotic large-distance behavior of the charge and number density combinations, the paper discovers that the leading asymptotic term at $\\beta>0$ stays at the forefront upon transitioning to the $\\beta\\to 0$ regime for the charge correlation function. In contrast, the number density correlation function witnesses interference between the first two asymptotic terms when travelling from strictly positive $\\beta>0$ values to the Debye-H\\\"uckel limit of $\\beta\\to 0$; this interference results in a discontinuity in the large-distance behaviour. This paper thus establishes that high-temperature $\\beta\\to 0$ limit and the large-distance asymptotics do not commute for the density correlation function of the two-dimensional Coulomb gas."}
{"text":"This paper presents the results of experiments exploring the magnetostrophic regime expected in planetary cores by conducting experiments in a rotating sphere filled with liquid sodium and applying a dipolar magnetic field (the DTS setup). The field was induced by an inner sphere with a permanent magnet rotating at a separate rate, creating a spherical Couette flow. The flow properties were examined by measuring electric potentials on the outer sphere, the induced magnetic field in the lab frame, and velocity profiles in the liquid sodium with ultrasonic Doppler velocimetry. The results show that the majority of the fluid shell has a relatively uniform angular velocity, with a slight rise near the inner sphere, which reveals the presence of a magnetic wind and gently drops towards the outer sphere. The transition from magnetostrophic to geostrophic flows is determined by the Elsasser number in the Rossby numbers of approximately 1. Numerical simulations, combined with a torque-balance model, are used to compare measured and synthetic velocity profiles in the geostrophic region. It was found that the induced magnetic field varied in a consistent manner and displayed a peak in the counter-rotating regime when the fluid and outer sphere rotation rates were almost equal and opposite, resulting in a nearly rest state in the laboratory frame. This phenomenon could be potentially advantageous for dynamo action."}
{"text":"\nThis paper presents a generalization of the Stillinger-Lovett sum rules for the two-dimensional jellium, accordinf to the classical Coulomb fluids in the equilibrium statistical mechanics. These sum rules of the second-moment determine the screening cloud of the charge density as a consequence of one of the $q$-charges being fixed. Applying a mapping technique of the two-dimensional jellium with even positive integer coupling constants to a discrete one-dimensional anti-commuting field theory, the paper derives the generalized sum rules reproducing the standard Z = 1 and the trivial Z = 0 results, and tests these rules in the Debye-H\u00fcckel limit and at the free-fermion point. This generalized second-moment sum rule provides precise information about assumed sign oscillations of the induced charge density in the space."}
{"text":"\nIn this paper, radio continuum emission and optical spectroscopy was used to analyze the Low Surface Brightness (LSB) galaxy PGC 045080. Radio emission was detected in the galaxy disk at three different frequencies, and even hints at two distinct lobes at the higher two, suggesting the possible presence of a weak AGN. Optical spectroscopy of the nucleus revealed no strong AGN lines, however, their absence does not completely rule out the possibility of its presence. H$\\alpha$ and 1.4 GHz radio emission also appear to have non-thermal aspects. Impressively, a significant amount of AGN activity could be situated in the centre of this metal poor, low in star formation LSB galaxy. Additionally, an HI gas disk was mapped to reveal a warped, lopsided structure and the derived rotation curve showed a flat speed of ~190 km\/s."}
{"text":"\nWe examine the influence of anisotropic order parameter symmetry (OPS) on macroscopic quantum tunneling (MQT) in c-axis twist Josephson junctions made up of high-Temperature superconductors. Using the functional integral and bounce technique, we probe the impact of twist angle $\\gamma$ on the rate of MQT. The d-wave nature of OPS brings forth $\\cos2\\gamma$ and $\\sqrt{\\cos2\\gamma}$ dependencies of the crossover temperature from thermal activation to MQT and the standard deviation of switching current distribution, respectively. Additionally, a dissipative effect from nodal quasiparticle excitation is shown to be insignificant, which is consistent with experiments done on Bi${}_2$Sr${}_2$CaCu${}_2$O${}_{8 + \\delta}$ intrinsic junctions. These findings imply that MQT in c-axis twist junctions offers a great potential to test OPS of such substances at low temperatures and can be applied to qubit applications."}
{"text":"This article gives a twister description of four-dimensional N-extended (gauged) self-dual supergravity, taking Manin and Merkulov's earlier results as a starting point. By constructing supertwistor spaces associated with complex quaternionic right-chiral supermanifolds and providing additional supertwistor data, a supersymmetric generalization of Penrose's nonlinear graviton construction is obtained and LeBrun's Einstein bundle is extended to include nonvanishing cosmological constants. Implications are discussed, along with a real version of the theory related to Euclidean signature."}
{"text":"\nWe study the behavior of random stiff fiber networks in terms of elasticity. The elastic response of the fibers is associated with a stretching stiffness, as well as a bending stiffness perpendicular to the fiber's outline. Studies have revealed an anomalous elastic mode where stretching is frozen, enabling bending to fully dominate elastic energy. To determine the stretching and bending dominated \\emph{elastic forces}, simulations and scaling arguments were utilized. These reveal two mechanisms which transverse force in the network. Force is balanced by a homogeneous background medium when it is below a specific threshold, $F_c$. When force surpasses $F_c$, forces become heterogeneously distributed, leading to highly localized force-chains observed in granular media."}

{"text":"\nThe goal of this article is to employ path integral methods to study the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger polaron problem. The time and real space components of the Hamiltonian are both taken into account, with the electron particle paths being treated quantum mechanically and the lattice degrees of freedom integrated out exactly. By summing over a range of relevant particle paths which form the total partition function, the free energy and its temperature derivatives can be calculated. At low temperatures, the heat capacity over T ratio displays a growth pattern characteristic of glass-like behaviour, with the effects of electron-phonon anharmonic interactions explored by the cumulant expansion method. The square lattice, due to its larger overall hopping potential contribution, is found to show the strongest glass-like behaviour."}
{"text":"\nThis study investigates the effectiveness of photometric redshift measurements in gravitational lensing tomographic surveys aiming to gauge the dark energy equation of state. We examine the capabilities of ground- and space-based photometric data to accumulate the greatest figure of merit for dark energy parameters, with particular focus on the addition of near-infrared photometric observations, as Could be conducted by the planned DUNE satellite. By running simulations of photometric redshifts and utilising artificial neural networks, we gauge the relative proportion of improvement of the Figure of Merit for Dark Energy with the inclusion of space-based near-infrared observations. We also remark on the dependence of these results on the choice of filters, magnitude limits, and galaxy formation scenarios, as well as on the need for approximately $10^5 - 10^6$ spectroscopic redshifts for calibration."}
{"text":"\nThis study examines the dynamical nature of A115, an X-ray binary galaxy cluster at z=0.193, which harbours a radio relic. With the use of photometric and spectroscopic data collected from the Telescopio Nazionale Galielio, 85 galaxies were determined to be members of A115. Analysis of their velocity and position information revealed global dynamical characteristics and the presence of two distinct structures (A115N and A115S). The velocity dispersion of A115 was measured to be 1362_{-108}^{+126} km\/s and it was observed that there is a velocity difference between A115N and A115S of about 2,000 km\/s. Additionally, two small groups at lower velocities were also detected. Consequently, the virial mass of A115 was estimated at 2.2-3.5 x 10^15 h_70 Msun. The results suggest that A115 is currently in a pre-merger stage, with the cores of A115N and A115S taking around 0.1 Gyr to collide. The orientation of the radio relic relative to the merger axis may be related to this event."}
{"text":"\nThe evaluation of data warehouses is a key factor in determining their effectiveness in decision support scenarios. Traditional benchmarks, while useful to compare system performance, are not suitable for validating different design choices.

DWEB is highly parameterized, allowing for greater flexibility in designing data warehouses. It is also user-friendly, allowing for easy usage even for non-experts. An example of applying DWEB for validating different engineering choices is provided in this paper."}
{"text":"\nThis paper proposes an integrating approach for decision tree modeling within a classical database system using SQL queries. We have applied the Induction Decision Tree (ID3) algorithm to realize this procedure, which builds a decision tree represented as a set of successive, related relational views.

Furthermore, this manipulation of the data in a unified format can provide an abundance of metadata to assist in the data warehousing process. The flexibility and extensibility of XML also allows for its easy transformation into a database if more structuring is needed. Thus, this web data modeling allows for substantial time and performance gains when performing a multidimensional analysis or using data mining algorithms."}
{"text":"\nWe explore the relation between the continual growth rate of Tsallis q-entropy (proposed by Tsallis, 1988) in weakly chaotic orbits, and their variational equations of motion. This investigation implies that variational equations can lead to temporary solutions that exist for long periods of time withdeviation vectors of near orbits extending like a power-law. This power exponent is clearly connected to the entropic exponent. This leads to the formation of a new, sensitive index capable of discriminating regular and weakly chaotic orbits, referred to as the Average Power Law Exponent (APLE). We evaluate the effectiveness of APLE through its application to a thin separatrix layer of the standard map, a stickiness area around a steadiness basin of the same map, and a web of resonances of a 4D symplectic map. The outcomes highlight the presence of weakly chaotic orbits exhibiting the Tsallis q-entropy's 'metastable' behavior."}
{"text":"\nThe detailed morphology of solar prominences and filaments are studied in this article, exploring the diverse variety of fine structures observable even through ground-based telescopes. Theoretical models attempting to explain the nature of these structures are discussed as well. The discussion emphasizes the roles of magnetic and gas pressure, the dynamics of the fine structures and recent numerical simulations - looking at magnetic topology, energy balance and radiation transfer in multiple dimensions. Finally, the article proposes ways in which ground-based and space observation can shed light on physical aspects of the fine structures, including their prominence-corona transition regions in relation to the orientation of the magnetic field."}
{"text":"\nWe have observed extraordinary slow hole spin relaxation times in self-assembled InGaAs quantum dots. We generated individual spins within the ground orbital state in each dot and measured the spin orientation after a set time interval using a spin memory device. This generated a visible memory effect in luminescence polarization, which decreased for longer storage times. Analysis of the spin relaxation dynamics as a function of magnetic field and temperature indicated slow hole spin relaxation in highly confined quantum dots up to ~270 us. Theory calculations indicate that this is due to spin-orbit mediated phonon scattering between Zeeman levels, in distinction to higher dimensional nanostructures where relaxation has typically been caused by valence band mixing."}
{"text":"This article evaluates the dust distribution in seven nearby edge-on galaxies using both V and K'-band observations. I employed a radiative transfer model to decompose the images into stellar disks, bulges, and dust disks. Standard X^2 minimization techniques were utilized to acquire parameters which describe the distributions. Upon examining the face-on optical depth of the dust disks, I found that they were nearly transparent. In contrast, a second massive dust disk which has been implicated in past investigations of submillimeter emissions was not observed in the K'-band. To conclude, I consider the effects of complex structures and the influence of the model degeneracies on fitting the dust distributions."}
{"text":"\nThis paper reviews the design and implementation of a Circulating Hydrogen Ultra-High Purification System at the Petersburg Nuclear Physics Institute (PNPI). This system was developed specifically to provide a reliable method of maintaining the hydrogen gas inside the Time Projection Chamber (TPC) for the MuCap experiment, which is a high-precision measurement of the rate for electroweak muon capture. The system is based on an adsorption cryopump and cold adsorbent to encourage the hydrogen flow and clean it from impurities. In 2004, it was installed at the Paul Scherrer Institute and has operated successfully during three experiment runs. The hydrogen purity remained at a steady level of 20 ppb of moisture, 7 ppb of nitrogen, and 5 ppb of oxygen; while simultaneously the pressure of the TPC was regulated to within 0.024% of 10 bar at a flow rate of 3 standard liters per minute."}
{"text":"In this paper we studied how the coefficients of a multipole model for nucleon electromagnetic form factors might vary with the momentum transfer squared, taking logarithmic corrections as a starting point. Moreover, the superconvergence relations of this model lead to agreement with unitary constraints and perturbative QCD asymptotics for the form factors themselves. A soft photon emission was suggested as a possible mechanism to explain the discrepancies between Rosenbluth, polarization, and beam--target--asymmetry measurements. We found that the observed cross sections not only depend on the Dirac and Pauli form factors themselves, but on the number of photons released as well; the estimated number is different for proton compared to that of neutron. All in all, the combined data fitting accurately reproduces the $Q^2$-dependence, with a $\\chi^2\/dof$ of 0.86. An additional prediction of the model is that the ratios of the proton form factors $G_E\/G_M$ shall differ for Rosenbluth, polarization, and beam--target--asymmetry measurements, while the same ratios should be nearly identical for the neutron. This can thus be used to experimentally verify the model."}
{"text":"This article explores the asymptotic behavior of the optimal density and kissing number of sphere packings when observed in high dimensions. Building off of a century old lower bound obtained by Minkowski, the authors utilized a statistical-mechanical procedure to attempt to exceed this exponential improvement. This potential improvement is discovered to have an asymptotic behavior of $1\/2^{(0.77865...)d}$, where d is the Euclidean space dimension. Furthermore, the authors uncovered that there is a wide class of test functions that all lead to this same exponential improvement, suggesting that this behavior is much more general than previously assumed."}
{"text":"\nThe purpose of this paper is to re-examine the {\\cal N}=1 SU(N) SYM theory obtained from a marginal deformation of the {\\cal N}=4 theory, using a complex deformation parameter $\\beta$ and in the planar limit. Our earlier study in hep-th\/0606125 identified conformal invariance as requiring that $\\beta$ be real. In this paper, we loosen the condition of finiteness and instead aim to achieve a theory with vanishing beta functions in the planar limit. We have calculated explicit results up to five loops. Our data demonstrate that although it is possible to achieve vanishing beta functions with a complex $\\beta$, the theory will not be finite and the results depend heavily on the arbitrary choice of the subtraction procedure. In other words, conformal invariance requires $\\beta$ to be real but the condition of having zero beta functions only produce ambiguous results. To validate these assertions, we have also utilised different approaches in differential renormalization."}

{"text":"\nDetailed spectroscopic observations of extended Ly-alpha sources at redshifts z~3-5 were carried out with VLT\/VIMOS. Our study reveals that the equivalent widths of Ly-alpha lines for all 18 sources exceed 100\\AA. Out of those, five demonstrate conspicuous asymmetry in the Ly-alpha line shapes, potentially indicating the presence of galactic superwinds. Moreover, a further eight sources display unusually large equivalent widths (larger than 200 \\AA), thus stressing their significance as young galaxies in the midst of a gas-cooling phase. Additionally, we observe a positive correlation between the Ly-alpha luminosity and the velocity width for these 8 objects."}

Furthermore, the implications of non-universal gaugino mass parameters on scalar masses, collider searches, high-precision measurements, cosmological constraints on the Dark Matter, and the gluino lifetime are taken into consideration. The differences in the Higgs boson, chargino, neutralino, and gluino decays, with respect to the universal gaugino masses scenario, are highlighted. Our findings are implemented into a FORTRAN code named SuSpect."}
{"text":"\n\nROXA is a new multi-frequency catalog of blazars selected from SDSS-DR4 and\n2dF survey data using a cross-correlation between large radio (NVSS, ATCAPMN)\nand X-ray (RASS) surveys.

{"text":"In this article, we analyse production of $t \\bar t$ at the Tevatron and the LHC, and its consequences on the presence of strongly interacting spin one particles such as axigluons and flavour universal colorons. We obtain limits on their masses from $t \\bar t$ data, which are found to be comparable to the those from dijet data. We conclude that top polarisation may be used to further discriminate the axigluon and coloron case from the SM as well as from each other. At the LHC, the signal of the presence of these particles should be visible in the $t \\bar t$ invariant mass spectrum for a wide range of axigluon and coloron masses that are still within these limits."}
{"text":"\nThis article takes a deeper look at the composition of eta and eta' mesons, coming to the conclusion that the c cbar components make up less than 5% of the amplitude. Additionally, there is some hint at a small gluonic component. We use a number of different processes in order to constrain the eta-eta' mixing angle to a single consistent value and provide predictions on two branching ratios. We offer a method of testing the mixing angle through chi_c2 decay modes and analyze the semileptonic and hadronic decays of bottom and charmed mesons. We present some clean ways to extract the mixing angle from the available data and discuss cases which require more detailed knowledge of different amplitudes."}
{"text":"This paper presents a spectrophotometric model applied to a large sample of ~6000 cluster galaxies, as part of the WIde-field Nearby Galaxy-cluster Survey (WINGS). Our method advantages itself by taking into account variations in dust extinction between younger and older stars, which has not been done previously in a spectral fitting code. A set of template spectra has been built with close hints in terms of spectral resolution, noise and wavelength coverage of spectra natively in our sample. Through our analysis, we investigate the reliability and the associated uncertainties with recovering certain physical parameters such as age and metallicity. Additionally, we perform a comparison test on a subset of the WINGS sample, which contains objects overlapping with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, showing remarkable agreement. Our findings shows that the stellar content as a function of age is reliably recovered, and uncertainties are minimally affected by the S\/N ratio. Nonetheless, the metallicity of the dominant stellar population is not always recoverable in an unequivocal way, depending on the Star Formation History pattern."}
{"text":"\nThis study utilizes the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) to search for evidence of low mass binary systems in the halo of dark matter thought to envelope the Milky Way. Since the formulization of Einstein's general theory of relativity in 1916, gravitational wave radiation has been predicted to exist, yet has not been directly observed. Gravitational wave radiation is created when two compact bodies, such as two black holes, orbit one another and lose energy in the form of gravitational wave radiation until they spiral into one another. This phenomenon produces the expected chirp waveform in the LIGO sensitive band. Additionally, observations of microlensing events in the Large Magellanic Cloud suggest that low mass black holes may comprise a portion of the massive compact astrophysical halo objects (MACHOs) thought to make up the Galactic halo's dark matter. Thus, an upper limit will be calculated on the rate of binary inspiral from two 0.5 solar mass black hole MACHOs in the halo, based on evidence from microlensing events and theoretical population predictions."}
{"text":"\nIn this paper, we use full-scale micromagnetic simulations to explore how magnetization excitations are affected in a thin extended film when a spin-polarized dc-current is injected through a point contact in a current-perpendicular-to-plane (CPP) geometry. We find two localized oscillation modes that have much weaker magnetoresistance oscillations than those of the propagating wave type. The first localized mode has a relatively homogeneous kernel, and the second is much more inhomogeneous. We also study the influence of non-linear damping and find frequency jumps in the region of the propagating wave mode and a narrowing of the current region in which the 'bullet' mode persists until it is eliminated by a sufficiently strong damping."}

We also show that the extended component possesses a well developed blue horizontal branch, which suggests that its formation and\/or evolution could have been quite different than other dwarf galaxies."}
{"text":"\nThe aim of this research is to explore the relationship between cosmic-ray protons (or hadrons) and interstellar medium (ISM) using observations of GeV gamma-rays from the Gamma-ray Large Area Space Telescope - Large Area Telescope (GLAST-LAT). We expect to detect gamma rays from neutral pion decays in high-density ISM regions from the Milky Way, Large Magellanic Cloud, and other satellite galaxies. Past observations from the Energetic Gamma Ray Experiment Telescope (EGRET) have already identified extended sources of gamma rays, such as in the LMC and Orion clouds, and GLAST-LAT will have the ability to detect many more with increased resolution and in a broader spectrum. In order to analyse gamma-ray extended sources from GLAST-LAT and EGRET, we have developed an innovative image restoration technique, rooted in the Richardson-Lucy algorithm, to accurately calculate the Point Spread Function (PSF) of each event. PSF values can vary more than one order of magnitude between gamma rays, depending on the energy and angle of impact in the instrument. This technique also incorporates wavelet filtering to combat the issue of low numbers of detected photons for most sources. Our preliminary studies of various EGRET sources have demonstrated the potential of our new technique for the detection and characterisation of extended gamma-ray sources."}
{"text":"\nThe magnetic and conductivity properties of thin Co-TiO2 layers, grown on both silicon and quartz substrates using Pulse Laser Deposition (PLD), are determined with varied oxygen partial pressures between 6.6 x 10-3 and 53 Pascals (Pa). X-ray diffraction and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy data shows that oxygen vacancies appear in the material at certain levels of partial pressure. These vacancies affect the electrical conductivity and magnetization, which become more pronounced as the concentration of vacancies rise. The resistivity-temperature graph follows a polaronic trend and the activation energies, in the region of 100-150meV, are typical of semiconducting layers."}
{"text":"This paper examines non-perturbative qualities of an Abelian Higgs model made out of singleton and double charged scalar fields, plus a single restricted Abelian gauge field. These components together can represent various examples of strongly correlated electronic systems, such as the high temperature superconductivity found in the overdoped regime and various materials possessing fractional quantum numbers. Through the use of analytical systems, as well as numerical facilitation, this article looks into the complicated phase structure of the model, locating peculiar features like Fermi Liquid, Spin Gap, Superconductor, and Strange Metallic Phases, as well as holon, spinon vortices, and monopoles. Additionally, the study came to note a radical intensification of the phase transition strength, converging to an initially second order transition eventually becoming the first order. The same phenomenon may occur in Quantum Chromodynamics when the temperature is nonzero, yet with a finite density of baryons. Thus, at a high enough baryon density, the change from a 2-flavor superconducting space to the 3-flavor one should yield a larger phase transition strength than usual."}

To address this issue, we introduce a novel approach combining data mining and virtual reality visualization, visual data mining. Utilizing the current advancements in virtual reality devices and intuitive interaction, we present Genome3DExplorer, a software solution designed for the visualization and interaction of genomic data. Our solution takes advantage of a suitable graphical and interaction paradigm, providing both a global and local view of the data, as opposed to traditional genomic database browsers which primarily focus on the zoom and details level."}
{"text":"\nThis study assesses the Wolf-Rayet (WR) content of the spiral galaxy NGC 300. Through the use of VLT\/FORS2 multi-object spectroscopy, we confirm 9 new WR stars, bringing the current WR census of the inner disk to 31. The WR nature of candidate #41 is established with an early-type WN nature, similar to the optical counterpart of IC 10 X-1. We also infer that if candidate #41 is the optical counterpart for NGC 300 X-1, its WR mass is 38Msun and its black hole mass is > 10 Msun based upon ground-based photometry, the period and WR wind velocity of the system. The estimated completion of WR stars is 95% amongst WC and 70% amongst WN, resulting in a total WR content of around 40, with N(WC)\/N(WN)~0.7. By additionally analysing Halpha star formation rate of the inner galaxy, we estimate a ratio of N(WR)\/N(O)~0.04."}

Specifically, we consider black hole mass, bolometric luminosity, Eddington fraction (L\/L_Edd) and spectral slope. Our findings suggest that quasars with elevated Eddington fractions are more likely to exhibit BALs than those with lower fractions. Additionally, an increase in luminosity produces a greater likelihood the quasar will show BALs.

{"text":"\nA new investigation of the ultra-Li-deficient star population compared their Be abundances determined from high-resolution and high signal-to-noise spectra from the Keck I telescope and its CCD. The results were conclusive in that all six stars, with two exhibiting lower levels, were also Be-deficient. This consistency lends itself to the notion that such stars have undergone mass transfer or mergers, which in turn destroyed or diluted lithium and beryllium in the process. With the exception of one star, G 139-8, the results match the models suggesting that initial rapid rotation plus extra-mixing caused the deficiencies. These findings consequently exclude the ultra-Li-deficient stars from being considered when determining the primordial abundance of Li as they no longer retain their Big Bang origin."}
{"text":"\nAnalysis of the data from the Milagro gamma-ray observatory for seventeen short (< 5 s) duration GRBs detected by satellites between 2000 - 2006 yielded no significant emission > 100 GeV in correlation with the bursts. Since high-energy gamma rays are known to be absorbed by the extragalactic background light (EBL) at redshifts higher than ~0.5, significant detections were only anticipated at lower redshifts. While most long-duration GRBs usually have redshifts above 0.5, it is thought that the opposite is the case for short GRBs. Consequently, fluence limits can be set thanks to the lack of a VHE signal. One GRB (050509b) appears to have a confirmed link to a galaxy at redshift 0.225, while a tentative association of another (051103) with the galaxy M81 has been suggested. These fluence limits were then corrected taking into account the EBL absorption at varying redshifts (0.1, 0.5, and 0.225), as well as for the case of z = 0."}
{"text":"We investigate the Arkani-Hamed, Georgi and Schwartz model of massive gravity in which the graviton acquires mass through the inclusion of a field that joins two metrics, one of which is separated. To gain insight into the propagators attributed to the graviton and Goldstone bosons, we employ gauge-fixing approximations akin to those in gauge theories. Using the computed propagators, the lowest-order tree-level interaction between two external energy-momentum tensors is evaluated. Our findings are independent of the gauge parameter and distinct from the predictions of massless gravity formulations, like General Relativity, even at a massless graviton state. Additionally, we demonstrate that the Fierz-Pauli-type graviton mass term is the 'unitary gauge' of a more extended model with a scalar field. This theory produces the vDVZ discontinuity in the propagation of a massive or massless linearized graviton. Furthermore, the vDVZ discontinuity solution is embedded in a theory that exhibits local Weyl symmetry under the conversion of the metric. Once the mass goes to zero, the Weyl symmetry evolves into a global one and gives a hint as to the form of a fully nonlinear theory that has a non-zero graviton mass."}
{"text":"This series of papers examines the initial phases of planetary formation by examining the evolution of the gas and solid components of protostellar disks from the infancy of T Tauri stars until the disappearance of the gas. This first article introduces equations which study the evolution of various grain types in a protostellar disk typically shaped by viscous accretion and photo-evaporation from the host star. An approach is used which assumes the grain size distribution maintains a power-law structure, enabling the calculation of the growth rate of the major grain sizes. Equations are determined to connect the gas and solid surface densities, and to self-consistently resolve and model the results. It is argued that there is a deposit of small grain particles at vast distances influencing the global development of solid material, and an empirical evolution equation is proposed to estimate the total heavy element enrichment acknowledged in the planetary formation process. Observations of the mass of solids in the Minimum Solar Nebula and the Oort Cloud set limits on the grain size distribution and turbulent parameters. Results from this paper are compared to those from investigations of SED's in a successive paper."}

Although there are no penguin contributions in these decays, mixing-induced CP violations in $B\\to D^{\\pm}\\pi^{\\mp}$ decays are expected due to interference of the Cabibbo-suppressed and Cabibbo-favored amplitudes and are supported by the experimental data.

Additionally, the linear polarization of the composite grains is calculated at three orientation angles and the wavelength of maximum polarization is determined. Further, an assessment of the grain's volume extinction factor - a key quantity from an interstellar abundance point of view - is conducted, and the resulting abundance estimates for carbon and silicon are found to be lower than that of bare silicate\/graphite grain models but higher than those implied by recent ISM values."}
{"text":"We assess the spin polarization (\\textbf{\\textit{P}}) of the magnetic semiconductor EuS utilizing zero-field and Zeeman-split Andreev reflection spectroscopy (ARS) with EuS\/Al planar junctions.

To measure a Zeeman-splitting of the quasiparticle density of states in Al, we developed a theoretical model incorporating the Maki-Fulde equations into a modified BTK analysis. With this method, we can determine the magnitude and sign of \\textbf{\\textit{P}}, with results in agreement to those obtained from the zero-field ARS data.

{"text":"\nA new investigation has been undertaken to further explore the correlation between oxygen vacancies and room temperature ferromagnetic ordering in Co doped ZnO1-o nanoparticles. Diffuse reflection spectroscopy in the UV-Vis region and electrical transport measurements of palletized sample of the nanoparticles were used to study the optical and electrical properties of the Co doped compositions. It was found that the band gap of the Co doped compositions decreased with increasing Co addition while reflections minima were observed at energies characteristic of Co+2 d-d (tethrahedral symmetry) crystal field transitions. A forming gas was observed to strongly decrease the resistivity with increasing Co concentration, while the air annealed and non-ferromagnetic samples had a reverse effect. For ferromagnetic samples, a change from insulator to metal occurred at temperatures above 380K, with the change becoming more prominent with higher Co content. The behavior was correlated with the model by Calderon et al, where the ferromagnetism changed from being mediated by polarons at low temperatures (insulator) to by carriers released from weakly bound states at higher temperatures (metallic)."}
{"text":"\nIn this paper, we demonstrate a technique to measure the top-quark mass in proton-antiproton collisions with a center-of-mass energy of 1.96 TeV.

{"text":"\nIn this paper we attempt to determine whether a universal mass function exists for all types of astronomical bodies. We identify nine distinct categories, including solar systems, exoplanets, brown dwarfs, stars, stellar remnants, open and globular clusters, molecular clouds, galaxies, and clusters of galaxies, along with data from high resolution numerical simulations of CDM halos. We conclude that the mass functions of each individual class, when normalized correctly, can indeed be combined to form an uninterrupted universal mass function ranging from mass values of 10^(-20)Msun to 10^(16)Msun, and spaning 36 orders of magnitude. A notable exception is seen with planets and small bodies, which appear to obey a flatter distribution. Remarkably, CDM halos from the simulations indicate a relation with a slope of -2 from galactic clusters to the planetary mass scale. This similarity is of great interest, as the formation processes for these objects are thought to be vastly different."}

We found indications of two new PWNe, HESS J1718-385 and HESS J1809-193, which were then confirmed with a standard H.E.S.S. analysis and search for multi-wavelength counterparts. H.E.S.S.'s large field of view and high sensitivity make it an effective tool for discovering PWNe in the very-high-energy regime.

By conditioning on a limited number of variables, we can determine the maximum size of the minimal separators in the concentration graph and demonstrate that they are equivalent to full conditional independence."}
{"text":"\nUsing the Order(N) Tight-Binding Molecular Dynamics Simulation, the thermal stability of a (10,10) metallic Single-Walled Carbon Nanotube (SWCNT) is investigated. After applying the periodic boundary conditions (PBC) in axial direction and the Velocity Verlet algorithm along with the canonical ensemble molecular dynamics (NVT), simulations of the SWCNT were performed at increasing temperatures, starting from 300K and expanding in steps of 300K. The effects on the physical characteristics, structural stability, and energetics when the temperature was raised in both slow and rapid increments were studied. Signs of deformation occurred at 600K, while bond breaking was found at 2500K. Thermal expansion coefficient between 300K-600K was measured as 0.31 x 10^(-5) (1\/K) when temperatures were increased slowly and 0.089 x 10^(-5) (1\/K) when heated quickly and over 600K both methods yielded the same result. Additionally, a ratio of total energy per atom to temperature was obtained, of 3 x 10^(-4) eV\/K."}
{"text":"\nUsing five quasar spectra in the near UV, we analyse the Lyman alpha forests of the intermediate redshift interval (0.9 < z < 1.9) to trace the baryon density of the intergalactic medium and the warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM). Estimations are made by obtaining data on the properties of photoionised IGM with hydrostatic equilibrium and the WHIM with broad Lyman alpha (BLA) absorption. The results indicate that the photoionised IGM contains at least 25% of the baryonic matter at 1 < z < 2 and a minimum of 2.4% resides in the WHIM. Furthermore, this analysis  confirms that the intergalactic gas is in a state of evolution at z=1.5, showing that a noteworthy part of the WHIM is generated between z=1 and z=2."}
{"text":"This paper investigates the performance of the AMBER \/ VLTI instrument and considerations around the data processing and calibration. It reveals that the instrument can be used to a specified precision in the medium and high spectral resolution and differential observables modes with bright objects. With absolute observables, however, the accuracy is limited by the night-long transfer function monitoring, as well as vibrations of the Unit Telescopes. For low-resolution mode, the limit is more with the data reduction, while faint objects become difficult to measure due to electromagnetic interferences with detector electronics. Possible solutions from within the data processing, as well as from a hardware update are proposed."}
{"text":"\nThis article examined where two nitrogen-based molecules (C2H5CN and C2H3CN) and two oxygen-based molecules (CH3OCH3 and HCOOCH3) are found in a selection of hot molecular cores (HMCs). Employing the IRAM-30m telescope, twelve HMCs were observed in the 21 bands from 86250 to 258280 MHz in an effort to find out if the O- and N-bearing materials seen in the Orion-HMC and W3 (H_2O) are common among all HMCs. The range of rotational temperatures that were obtained was from ~100 to ~150 K. A marginal velocity difference in the peak of the C2H5CN and CH3OCH3 lines showed a possible spatial distinction between the two molecules, however, linewidths, rotational temperatures, and column densities did not back this idea up. By comparing the C2H5CN\/C2H3CN ratios to the results of theoretical models the age of the cores ranged between 3.7 and 5.9\u00d710^4 years. Correlations were seen between the various molecules in terms of fractions and column density, but no relationship was revealed for the temperature."}
{"text":"\nThrough the investigation of planar clusters composed of Josephson $\\pi$-junctions ($\\pi$-rings), we reveal how the orientation of the classical orbital moments at the cluster is affected by their interactions. This is controlled either by a bias current or some other external stimulus. We demonstrate that such systems can be formulated as a two-dimensional Ising model with both nearest-neighbor and diagonal interactions. We consider the features of this model, utilizing exact solutions for small clusters such as a 5-site square plaquette and a mean-field type approach for an infinite square lattice of Ising spins. Our results are compared to Monte Carlo simulations for a 100 $\\times$ 100 square lattice, as well as to experiments. This manuscript also presents evidence that $\\pi$-ring clusters may be used as a new form of superconducting memory element. Furthermore, the outcomes of our research are applicable to adiabatic quantum computing, where the states are changed gradually using gradually varying coupling constants."}
{"text":"\nThis article examines the overlapping intersections between statistical mechanics, graph theory and combinatorics, lattice quantum field theory, super quantum mechanics and string theory. Using the dimer model on a graph embedded on a torus and the massless, free Majorana fermion living on the same lattice, a loop expansion of the fermion determinant is determined. The loops are then classified into co-chain groups through categorification, with the Euler characteristic of the resulting co-chain complex being identical to the Newton polynomial of the dimer model. Exploring the same system further, configuration with vanishing net winding number were found to form the ground states suggesting a connection to supersymmetric quantum mechanics. With the use of the quiver gauge theory - dimer model correspondence, furthermore, this article reveals how the loops are in fact related to the physics of the D-branes probing a toric Calabi-Yau singularity."}
{"text":"\nThe aim of this article is to study the interaction between a small quantum scattering system (the microsystem) and a large system (the macrosystem). The interaction is assumed to be diagonal in a certain orthonormal basis and involve minimal energy and momentum transfer. An analysis of the transition amplitude for both systems is done using scattering theory, and it is determined that the macrosystem's particle may interact in a random way leading to the wave packet being reduced to one of the basis vector states. In the thermodynamic limit, the ensemble of microsystems and macrosystems develops into a final state with the microsystem in one of the basis vector states and the macrosystem in an entangled state. This final state interaction therefore provides evidence of \"quantum measurement\" as a macroscopic external system."}
{"text":"\nThis paper presents an in-depth analysis of elemental abundances for eleven damped Ly-alpha systems (DLAs) observed at redshifts of 1.7-2.5. In the previous paper of this series (Paper I), we showed that we can derive star formation histories and ages from the abundance patterns of three DLA galaxies. Here, we extend our analysis to six additional galaxies. These findings confirm that no single star formation history explains the variety of abundance patterns in DLAs. Our models show that the DLAs possess characteristically low star formation rates ranging from -3.2 to -1.1 Msol\/yr\/kpc2. We also observe a large range of ages in our sample, ranging from 20 million years to 3 billion years; the oldest DLA in the sample (at z_DLA=1.864) suggests that galaxy formation was already underway at z_f>10. However, most DLAs show surprisingly young ages, indicating that galaxies were formed at relatively low redshifts (z~3). Comparing the star formation properties of DLAs to other high-redshift galaxies in deep imaging surveys, our study offers a comprehensive view of early galaxies in the universe."}
{"text":"\nBy utilizing fluorescence in situ hybridization, this article measured the 3D physical distance between specified genomic positions on chromosomes 1 and 11 of G1 cell nuclei found in human primary fibroblasts. Results, which are based off of polymer physics, demonstrate that chromatin folding is comparable to a polymer in a globular state. This globular state is regulated by attractive interactions which suppress the self-avoidance force exhibited by the chromatin. It was also determined that highly expressed and lowly expressed genomic domains differ regarding the Kuhn length and their chromatin compaction. This results in a range of compact globular folding states across cells. Furthermore, it was revealed that the folding of chromatin is seen on different length scales and can even apply to entire chromosome arms. Altogether, this article explores the intras chromatin fiber folding and provides novel insight into the folding of the chromatin fiber in interphase."}
{"text":"\nIn this study, we explore the properties of the highest mass galaxy, known as the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG), located in the nearby (z=0.035) X-ray cluster 2A0335+096, using deep emission-line imaging along with long-slit optical spectroscopy, archival VLA, Chandra X-ray, and XMM UV data. The X-ray images suggest a highly structured optical emission-line system inside the cluster, along with a curved filament of H-alpha emission around a resolved radio source. Moreover, comparisons of optical and radio data provide evidence for interactions between the BCG and a companion galaxy in the last ~50 Myrs. Our estimations suggest a star formation rate of >7 solar masses\/yr, which is in agreement with cooling rate predicted by XMM spectra. Further investigations reveal that the peak of X-ray emission does not match with the peak of H-alpha emission, nor does it lie in the BCG. The results of this study suggest a possible common trigger mechanism, causing similar timescales for depletion and accumulation of cool gas, dynamical time in the system, and the estimated age of the radio lobes."}

{"text":"\nThis research examines the performance of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Automatic Relevance Determination (ARD) when utilized in combination with a Multi-Layer-Perceptron (MLP) network for determining damage in a structure. PCA offers reduction of input data dimension by projecting it to a lower dimension space, which could lead to important influencing parameters being diluted by those that don't effect the data's dynamics. Conversely, ARD selects the most relevant input parameters while limiting the effect of parameters that don't notably influence the dynamics. It was observed the ARD and PCA provided similar accuracy levels, meaning the choice of which scheme to use is dependent on the data's nature."}
{"text":"\nThis article studies the application of evolutionary optimisation techniques in template-based image registration. An error function is devised to calculate the fit of the template to the image. The task is to optimise the horizontal, vertical and scaling parameters that would position the template in proper alignment with the scene. Four different optimisation methods are compared: Genetic Algorithm, Simulated Annealing, Particle Swarm Optimisation, and Nelder-Mead Simplex. The paper looks at the exactness and the correctness of each method and found that all four work effectively for image registration; with Simulated Annealing scoring the highest for accuracy, Genetic Algorithm being the most accurate, Particle Swarm providing a good blend of the two, and Nelder-Mead Simplex returning the most local minimums. To further enhance performance, it is recommended to consider adding a pre-processing stage to the evolutionary methods, as well as exploring the potential benefits of discrete versions of the said optimisation algorithms."}
{"text":"\nInvestigations into the longevity of electric dipole moments (EDMs) of diamagnetic atoms prove as dependable measures of CP-violating hadronic and semi-leptonic interactions. As such, interpretation of the results of these experiments necessitate cautious enforcement of the widely observed theorem devised by Schiff, postulating a lack of a permanent EDM in an atom made entirely of point- like non- relativistic constituents interacting only electrostatically. Conversely, any perceived non-zero atomic EDM would trace back to deviations in the point-like, non-relativistic, electrostatic theory. We herein restate Schiff's theorem on the operator level and compile a distribution of atomic matrix elements from both electronic and nuclear operators tending to invalidate the suggestive \"Schiff screening\". We also enunciate a pattern for the frontrunner of such deviations -- the \"Schiff moment\" operator, which varies in contrast to the already utilized operators in earlier Schiff moment estimations. We demonstrate that the more general Schiff moment operator defaults to prior use operators only under certain tolerances that are often not reasonable. Additionally, we distinguish other alterations to Schiff screening that may not have been previously involved in theoretical dealings. We further intend to decorate a comprehensive analysis of corrections to Schiff screening in atomic EDM estimations."}
{"text":"\nIn this article, we propose that super-massive black holes (SMBHs) are continually fed with randomly directed mass and angular momentum, resulting in warped accretion discs with mass deposition events that promote SMBH accretion at a much faster rate than expected by viscous processes. We additionally explore several potential implications of this hypothesis, such as light discs that can supply AGN and quasars yet avoid star formation, star formation at both low and high mass accretion rates, Compton-thick obscuring structures of parsec-scale size, black hole growth acclerated by the misalignment of discs and the black hole spin, isotropic SMBH energy and momentum feedback that is able to effectively operate on the galaxy at large, no correlation between SMBH activity and the presence of kiloparsec disk structures, merger-augmented gas streams that speed up SMBH growth, and a decreased likelihood of forming nuclear star clusters in galaxies that experience fewer mergers."}
{"text":"\nThe structure, size, and arrangement of magnetic nanoparticles with Neel surface anisotropy were investigated by modelling them as many-spin systems. It was revealed that the energy of particles cut from cubic lattices can be represented by effective one-spin potentials containing uniaxial and cubic anisotropies. Results show that the values and signs of these constants are highly dependent on the arrangement and structure of the nanoparticle, as well as its elongation. It was additionally discovered that strong surface effects can induce changes in the signs of uniaxial and core anisotropies in symmetric and elongated particles, respectively. Additionally, the competition between core and surface anisotropies was found to lead to a new energy that contributes to effective 2nd and 4th-order anisotropies."}
{"text":" In this paper, we investigate the family of generalized Brjuno functions associated to \\alpha-continued fractions for \\alpha in the interval [0,1]. This includes the Gauss map (\\alpha=1), the nearest integer (\\alpha=1\/2) and the fraction-by-excess (\\alpha=0) continued fraction maps. We associate to each of these expansions a positive function u on the interval I_\\alpha   and construct their corresponding generalized Brjuno functions B_(\u03b1,u)(x). We compare the functions obtained with different values of \\alpha and prove that the set of (\u03b1,u)-Brjuno numbers does not depend on the choice of \\alpha as long as \u03b1>0. We also consider the case when \u2500\u03b1=0, u(x)=-log(x) and prove that x is a Brjuno number (for \\alpha> 0) if and only if x and -x are both Brjuno numbers for \\alpha=0. The regularity properties of these generalized Brjuno functions, including BMO regularity and their extension to the complex plane are also discussed."}
{"text":"In this article, we extend the theoretical work presented in Ref.[1] and provide a comprehensive set of numerical results. Our goal is to measure the strength of the strong force of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), \\alpha_s^{exp}(Q^2), by comparing it to the measured spectrum of quarkonium. A Bethe-Salpeter (BS) formalism, which utilizes a Wilson loop to encapsulate confinement, is used to compare the two. Additionally, the standard perturbative strong coupling, \\alpha_s(Q^2) is replaced by the Analytic Perturbation Theory (APT) ghost-free expression, \\alpha_E(Q^2). The similarity between \\alpha_s^{exp}(Q^2) and \\alpha_E(Q^2) is good from 1 GeV to 200 MeV, confirming the accuracy of the APT. The results from the experiments at lower energies may also hint at a vanishing of \\alpha_s(Q^2) as Q approaches 0. This is similar to what is found in lattice results and in a ``massive'' extension to the APT approach. We suggest that the combination of the BS and APT methods provides a correlated and reliable understanding of the phenomena from hundreds of MeV to hundreds of GeV."}
{"text":"\nThe effects of hadronic interactions on the yield of $D_{sJ}$(2317) mesons in relativistic heavy ion collisions at RHIC are investigated in this study. Utilizing the quark coalescence model, we calculate the amount of $D_{sJ}$(2317) mesons produced in the quark-gluon plasma phase. The results show that the yield of the $D_{sJ}$(2317) meson is highly sensitive to its quark structure, being significantly higher for a two-quark than for a four-quark state. Taking into account the production and absorption of $D_{sJ}$(2317) mesons during the hadronic stage of collisions using a kinetic model, it is found that the ultimate yield remains dependent on the initial abundance in the quark-gluon plasma, thus offering an opportunity to explore the quark structure and production mechanism of the $D_{sJ}$(2317) meson in relativistic heavy ion collisions."}

{"text":"\nBy analyzing deep optical and infrared observations of the short duration GRB 050906, we found that the source of the burst is not likely to be random, given its location in the relatively local starburst galaxy IC328 and the possibility of a nearby moderately rich galaxy cluster at z=0.43. No X-ray or optical\/IR afterglow was discovered, leaving us to discuss the limits our observations place on the GRB progenitor. We consider two potential progenitors, the soft-gamma repeater SGR 1806-20 and a merging compact object system, and discuss their expected optical signatures. Furthermore, our observation revealed no residual optical or infrared emission, either in the form of an afterglow or later time emission from any associated supernova-like event."}
{"text":"This paper presents evidence showing that exchange-only optimized effective potential (xOEP) calculatons, while using finite basis sets, are not able to produce Hartree-Fock (HF) ground state energies. This goes against Staroverov, Scuseria and Davidson's assertion that xOEP can lead to exact HF energers under certain circumstances. Solutions to this paradox have been identified too: xOEP only represents exact exchange-only Kohn-Sham methods when the orbital and auxiliary basis sets are balanced. Without this balance, it is not a true KS method, and yields unphysical exchange potentials."}
{"text":"This article evaluates the implementation of four-momentum conservation in a parton shower algorithm. It reveals that four-momentum conservation compromises an analytic control of the underlying probability distribution. We present a solution to this problem by demonstrating how to modify parton showers such that they maintain four-momentum while allowing the restoration of analytic control. In addition, this paper explains how this analytic control can be utilized to pair parton showers with matrix element calculations, as well as to evaluate the uncertainties associated with power corrections in parton showers."}
{"text":"\nThe newly identified Einstein ring LBG J213512.73-010143 (the 'Cosmic Eye') has been explored for its mass distribution using data from the Hubble Space Telescope. Our analysis reveals a dual-component lens made up of both baryonic and dark matter components. The dark matter halo has a central slope that aligns with the parameters produced by CDM simulations, and the baryonic component has a B-band mass-to-light ratio in line with local ellipticals. In addition, the model correctly predicts the external shear from a neighbouring cluster. By generalising an inversion method, we find that the two visible peaks across the light source identify themselves as a single galaxy. Thus, we can assign a mass proportion of 46% (+\/- 11%) to the baryons within the Einstein radius of 0.77\" (5.6 kpc)."}
{"text":"\nWe use the Plateau de Bure Interferometer to detect CO(3-2) emission from a bright, gravitationally magnified Lyman Break Galaxy, LBGJ213512.73-010143, at z=3.07. This is the second detection of molecular gas from an LBG, from which we infer an intrinsic molecular gas mass of (2.4+\/-0.4)x10^9 Mo. Through lens reconstruction of the UV morphology of the LBG, we find two components separated by ~2 kpc; CO emission appears to be centered on the fainter UV component. The velocity width of the line indicates a dynamical mass of (8+\/-2)x10^9csc(i)^2 Mo within the central 2 kpc. Using analysis of mid-infrared observations from Spitzer, we determine the stellar mass to be ~(6+\/-2)x10^9 Mo, and the star-formation rate to be ~60 Mo\/yr; this suggests the molecular gas could be consumed in ~40 Myr. Our study reveals the Cosmic Eye to be a high-redshift, gas-rich analog of a local luminous infrared galaxy, though with a lower gas fraction, gas surface density and star-formation efficiency than submillimeter-selected galaxies. This observation serves as an example of how current facilities, augmented by gravitational magnification, can study 'ordinary' galaxies at high-redshift, foreshadowing the capabilities of ALMA."}
{"text":"\nThis study investigates the role of stars in galaxies, intracluster stars, and the intercluster medium, in order to determine their combined contribution to the total baryon budget for nearby galaxy clusters and groups. Our results show that the baryon mass fraction (f_b) within r500 remains uniform between 6e13 and 1e15 Msun, and is generally lower than the WMAP measure. We do not identify any hidden baryonic components that potentially vary in magnitude with increasing cluster mass. We further observe that the amount of X-ray gas mass rises with an increase in total mass, which can be attributed to a concomitant reduction in star formation efficiency. In addition, the proportion of stellar luminosity contained in the central galaxy and intracluster light gradually reduces in environments with greater velocity dispersion. Notably, there are low mass groups with substantial BCG+ICL components, signifying that the formation of intracluster stars need not be contingent on a massive cluster setting. On average, 40% and 33% of total stellar light is present within r500 and r200, respectively."}
{"text":"This article explores the characteristics and potential methods for discovering neutral leptons in the extended Standard Model (nuMSM). We investigate the lower and upper bounds of interaction strength of neutral leptons based on cosmological evidence, as well as data on neutrino oscillations. We study the production of neutral leptons in decays of mesons and $pp$ collisions, and assess the lower bound of the mass of these leptons from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and current experimental data. Additionally, we suggest a missing energy signal in kaon decays to help improve the strength of neutral lepton couplings in finding or rejecting them below the kaon threshold. To investigate the cosmologically important mass range above the kaon, dedicated searches with intensive proton beams need to be deployed, such as those conducted at CERN PS191. Proton beams from CNGS, NuMI, T2K, or NuTeV could be used to search for singlet leptons below the charm mass in the wide parameter space of the nuMSM. For a mass range of 2-5 GeV, a higher intensity of proton accelerators or a comprehensive analysis of more than 10 billion B-meson decays may be necessary."}
{"text":"\nBy using angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES), a study of UPd2Al3, a heavy Fermion antiferromagnetic superconductor, investigated the transition of f electrons between localized and itinerant state according to temperature. This transition occurs around T*, typically ranging from few K to few tens K. Below T*, the f-electrons form Fermi surfaces and the itinerant nature of f-electrons is explained by the itinerant f-electron model. By contrast, above T*, the f-bands are excluded from Fermi surfaces, and their magnetic properties are described by the ionic f-electron model. The results of this study provide insight into how the same f-electrons demonstrate itinerant as well as localized behavior at different temperatures and could further lead to a unified description of localized and itinerant nature of heavy Fermion compounds."}
{"text":"\nThis paper has developed new relativistic mean-field Lagrangians based on the Brown-Rho scaling due to the chiral symmetry restoration at high densities and adjusted the parameters taking into account naturalness of the coupling constants. The equation of state at supra-normal densities is consistent with collective flow data from high energy heavy-ion reactions, while the density dependence of the symmetry energy at sub-saturation densities matches with the isospin diffusion results from intermediate energy heavy-ion reactions. This newly developed model produces an equation of state which is soft at intermediate densities, but stiff at higher densities and predicts the canonical neutron star radii being in the range of 11.9 km to 13.1 km, and the maximum mass close to 2.0$M_\\odot$."}
{"text":"\nA quantum model in Hilbert space, previously developed by Aerts (2007a), has now been extended into a quantum field theory model in Fock space to analyze the combination of concepts. Item and concept vectors are represented in this space and the membership weights of items are modeled through the use of quantum probabilities. To illustrate the power of this new model, the disjunction of concepts was used as an example and the predicted membership weights for items were compared to the results of an experiment conducted by Hampton (1988b). The observed overextension and underextension effects could be explained as due to quantum interference and superposition of items. The perfect match between the new theory and Hampton's experimental data supports the need for the genuine properties of quantum field theory when making predictions about such complex systems."}
{"text":"\nThis paper explores the link between the cyclical motion of charge carriers and the spin splitting in solid materials. Our primary focus is on the Rashba model and electrons in the conduction band of an asymmetric semiconductor structure. We provide analytical equations, taking into account the Zeeman splitting, to study the recent magnetic focusing data. Surprisingly, we find that Rashba effect can be the dominant factor, even when the Rashba and Zeeman energies are of similar magnitude. Furthermore, we elucidate that spin dependant cyclotron motion has its roots in the Zitterbewegung-like oscillation of charge carriers, coming from the spin-split bands. We discuss the relationship between these two concepts and estimate the influence of Zitterbewegung-related corrections on the charge carriers' canonical placement."}
{"text":"We investigate the dynamics of a fast-spinning magnetar interacting with the supernova shock and host star. By solving the two-dimensional, axisymmetric thin-shell equations, we model the creation of a bubble of plasma and magnetic fields in the first 10-100 seconds after core collapse. Increasing the ratio of magnetic to total power supplied by the magnetar, L_mag\/L_tot, leads to an asymmetrical expansion of the bubble due to the pinching effect. We find that a ratio of 0.3 is enough to produce a significant amount of pressure near the rotation axis and drive a collimated outflow through the stellar material. We contend that such magnetar-driven bubbles could be responsible for the collimated outflows observed in long-duration gamma-ray bursts. Later on, the decrease in the neutron star\u2019s cooling leads to increasingly magnetically-dominated outflows and may act as the source of the GRB."}
{"text":"In this paper, we present the findings of an investigation using the VLA and Spitzer Space Telescope to characterize cm radio continuum emission from the low-luminosity, mid-infrared protostar located within the Lynds 1014 dense core.

Circular polarization was also detected at a 5$\\sigma$ level. Despite no 22 GHz H2O maser emission being detected, the cm radio emission from L1014-IRS exceeds expectations according to established 3.6 cm and 6 cm luminosity versus bolometric luminosity correlations. We compare the emission from L1014-IRS with other low-mass protostars, and discuss the implications of the updated distance measurements on the core and protostar."}

{"text":"\nIn this article, we investigate the global and gravitational lensing characteristics of Einstein cluster WIMP models as possible galactic dark matter halos. This type of cluster is noticeably pressure dominated and systemically anisotropic, allowing an exact description of any galactic rotation curve. We explore their stability under radial and non-radial oscillations, ultimately concluding that they remain structurally sound. Utilizing a set of Buchdahl inequalities for anisotropic bodies, we measure the maximum velocity attainable by the particles which compose the cluster. These velocities are consistent with the analyzed stability. From light deflection tests, it becomes evident that Einstein clusters produce a slightly lower lensing effect in comparison to singular isothermal spherical models for dark matter. Consequently, evidence from gravitational lensing studies could possibly differentiate between the two models."}

Moreover, the approach is much faster than either of the two, with a computational speed more than 2.5 times faster than the genetic algorithm and 24 times faster than simulated annealing. The benefits of the proposed method are demonstrated with an unsymmetrical H-shaped structure."}

The theory is validated with molecular dynamics simulations and shown to accurately capture the fluid's non-equilibrium steady state properties as well as its relaxational nature."}

It was found that charge packets can be injected stably with a dispersion of only 91eV (FWHM) in the column corresponding to 5.1keV X-ray energy, which is much smaller than the dispersion of 113eV (FWHM) produced by actual X-ray events. Furthermore, the charge losses as measured by the charge injection capability matched that measured by a calibration source, verifying its ability to measure column-dependent charge losses accurately. The application of a column-to-column CTI correction to the calibration source spectra was found to have a significant effect: the line widths of the spectra were reduced from 193eV to 173eV (FWHM) on average. Additionally, the low energy tail in the line profile of the calibration source spectrum was also greatly diminished."}
{"text":"\nThis paper explores the implications of using the Casimir effect to quantitatively account for the universe's accelerating expansion. We examine the impact of the Casimir force, which scales like $(-)(1+z)^4$, on the Friedmann\u2013Robertson\u2013Walker (FRW) model by constructing a two-dimensional dynamical system. This examination reveals a set of possible universe evolutional paths with a bounce solution and initial singularity, which differ significantly from the key characteristics of the Lambda Cold Dark Matter (LambdaCDM) model. We then assess the power of explanation of the Casimir-driven FRW model and the LambdaCDM model via Bayesian information criterion and Bayesian factor comparison. Our results demonstrate a tendency of preference for the LambdaCDM model, although a potential disagreement between the theoretical and observed primordial abundances of helium-4 and deuterium could be rectified by the inclusion of a negative radiation term."}
{"text":"\nThe purpose of this paper is to explore whether obtaining precise geomagnetic data can be used to learn about the concealed dynamics of the core. With the help of a one-dimensional, nonlinear, and unevenly monitored model of magnetohydrodynamic equilibriums, the authors investigate whether Variational Data Assimilation (VDA) is an appropriate approach for uncovering the evolution of both the core's velocity and magnetism. Their results show that even without direct observations of the velocity, VDA can correctly model the entire course of both fields. Therefore, this work offers a stepping stone to understanding the previous, present, and future of the geomagnetic field through the reintegration of historic data and making geomagnetic predictions."}
{"text":"This research investigates the minimal size of barchan dunes, which are crescent-shaped, highly mobile dunes. Hersen, Douady, and Andreotti found that the size of sand dunes is dependent on the sand flux saturation point, as well as wind friction speed. Three-dimensional calculations of sand transport show that the minimal size of barchans found along coasts is around tens of centimeters high. Additionally, the entry rate for particles into saltation on Mars is found to be one order of magnitude greater than on Earth, and is necessary for obtaining the minimal dune size. The findings from this research determine how the minimal size of barchan dunes depends on sand flux, wind speed, and location."}
{"text":"\nThis paper investigates the dynamics of Hill's equation when its forcing terms with varying strength and periodicity are randomly perturbed. To analyze the development of solutions to the equation, a discrete map is studied. The case of pure positive and mixed elements are examined, and analytical expressions, bounds, and estimates for the growth rates are found. Additionally, exact expressions, estimates, and bounds for the infinite products of $2\\times2$ matrices with random variables in the elements are provided. In the delta-function limit, analytic solutions for each cycle and the discrete map mapping them from one cycle to the next are examined, along with growth rates and the condition for instability in large forcing strength as well as the widths of stable\/unstable zones."}
{"text":"This article presents an overview of game-theoretic approaches to energy-efficient resource allocation in wireless networks, particularly focusing on multiple-access networks. It is shown that game theory can help in determining the best strategy for each user in order to maximize its own utility, while following its quality of service requirements. This utility function is designed to count the amount of reliable bits transmitted in relation to the energy consumed. Consequently, the strategies that can be taken into consideration include the choice of transmission power, rate, modulation, packet size, multi-antenna processing algorithm and carrier allocation strategy. The best possible strategy and the Nash equilibrium is then derived from this game-theoretic framework. Finally, the impacts on energy efficiency and network capacity of power control, rate control, modulation, spatial and temporal signal processing and carrier allocation strategy are provided."}
{"text":"\nIn this article, a game-theoretic method is used to analyze how variations in constellation size impact the energy efficiency of code-division multiple access (CDMA) networks that have a set Quality-of-Service (QoS) delay limit. A non-cooperative game is proposed where users attempt to maximize their individual utility, which is measured by the amount of reliable data transmitted for a given amount of energy consumption, while satisfying the designated delay QoS. The article illustrates the best-response strategies, Nash equilibria, and the trade-offs between energy efficiency, delay, throughput, and constellation size. It is established that to achieve the utmost utility (in bits per joule), a user is to choose the smallest constellation size that meets their delay requirements, as opposed to maximizing spectral efficiency. The influence of trellis-coded modulation on energy efficiency is then explored."}
{"text":"\nUsing AdS\/CFT duality, we demonstrate the ability of gravity to model the dynamics of a 1+1 dimensional Bjorken expansion in QCD. We focus on finding an exact bulk solution and show that this solution can be used to describe part of the spinless Banados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) black hole, with the angular dimension unwrapped. Then, utilizing thermodynamics of the BTZ black hole to compute the time-dependent temperature and entropy density at the boundary, we identify the boundary fluid as an ideal gas in local thermal equilibrium. We find that with angular momentum of the bulk, it produces a boundary flow that is boost invariant but with a nonzero longitudinal velocity compared to the Bjorken expansion."}
{"text":"The search for transiting extrasolar giant planets requires careful analysis in order to distinguish between true positives and false positives. In order to address this issue, we have undertaken the Trans-atlantic Exoplanet Survey (TrES) which has presented us with numerous false positives. We discuss some examples of these false positives, including the K dwarf binary system GSC 03885-00829 which was found to be superimposed on a late F dwarf star. Despite the abundance of false positives, our careful analysis has allowed us to discover two true transiting giant planets. We present our follow-up observations of TrES-2, the first of these transiting planets found in the Kepler field. This research highlights the need to utilize a rigorous approach for distinguishing between true and false positives for successful exoplanetary discovery."}
{"text":"\nIn this study, we investigate the Fe Kalpha line profiles and images of relativistic discs around a rotating black hole in order to establish an understanding of how accretion flows and parameters of the disc and black hole can be determined from observed line profiles. To analyze the effects of a disc's finite thickness on the line profiles, a novel, fully relativistic code is employed, taking into account the relativistic Doppler boost, time dilation, gravitational redshift, and light bending. Our code results indicate that an increase in disc thickness diminishes the separation between and relative height of the blue and red peaks. Redshift and flux images of the disc are calculated, and a great difference is revealed in the disc's appearance based on the inclination angle. Notably, for high inclination angles, the black hole shadow is completely hidden, demonstrating the self-shadowing of the disc."}
{"text":"This study investigates the impact of national scientific facilities on non-biomedical research using the h-index proposed by Hirsch. With the goal of providing the highest standard of comparison for federal investment in science, data from physical sciences, engineering and technology were considered, excluding the biomedicine field. Molinari and Molinari developed a method to allow for meaningful comparisons between institutions and a universal growth rate for large numbers of papers was found to be consistent across all categories. Comparisons between individual disciplines were made and the results showed that many of the national facilities compare favorably with universities in terms of research impact."}
{"text":"\nStudying strongly interacting nanostructures requires sophisticated techniques. In this work, we assess the finite-size effects when using the time-dependent density matrix renormalization group (tDMRG) approach or the embedded-cluster approximation (ECA) on one or three serially connected quantum dots, and address a recent controversy between the results of both methods. We suggest a procedure, which involves comparing results for static quantities from quasi-exact methods, like the ground-state density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method or exact diagonalization, to identify the optimum cluster type. The scope of applying ECA can then be broadened by implementing the optimal clusters discussed here. We find that to observe Kondo-like effects, the best clusters involving dots and leads must have a total z-component of the spin equal to zero."}
{"text":"\nBy taking advantage of the availability of highly pure stable isotopes, this article presents an investigation into the dependence of the heat capacity of lead sulfide (a semiconductor with rock salt structure) on its isotopic composition. Employing a variety of methods, including \\textit{\\textit{ab initio}} calculations and temperature dependent $C_p \\approx C_v$ measurements, the effects of the large difference in mass between lead, with $M_{\\rm Pb}$ = 207.21, and sulfur, with $M_{\\rm S}$ = 32.06, are analyzed. The results are compared with predictions from the local density approximation (LDA) electronic band structure and deviations are attributed to a lack of spin-orbit interaction in the ABINIT program."}
{"text":"This paper explores the possibility of using an array of 'screw-rockets', each powered by mini-nuclear engines, to deflect a large and spinning asteroid from its trajectory before it impacts the Earth. Landing each engine-unit on the asteroid's surface allows for a fraction of the soil to be ejected vertically in order to increase the momentum exchange. This exhaust propulsion is enabled as the engines are phased in relation to one another and are robust enough to create an array that can compensate for the angular velocity of the asteroid. Tests of deflection theories can be conducted on distant asteroids, an example of which being 99942 Apophis, which is estimated to just 2% of km^3. This deflection method allows for not only safe redirection of the asteroid, but also presents an opportunity to train humans how to land, dig, build and nest inside an asteroid. Additionally, the large momentum exchange generated by this method can drive an asteroid on a lengthy journey, such as to Mars, with its moon Phobos as a beneficial fueling stopover."}
{"text":"This recent article examines the zero-lag long-range synchronization through a dynamical relaying process in systems with delays. It was originally reported by Fisher et al. that in a scenario with two coupled systems A and C, with a delay between them, the introduction of a third element B will allow the two systems to synchronize even in areas of the parameter space where synchrony was not possible before. This research ultimately confirms these results and goes further to clarify the mechanism behind it, particularly as occurs in quadratic maps, Kuramoto and R\u00f6ssler oscillators. Furthermore, a simpler case of the same phenomenon is also reported, which displays nearly the same characteristics as the case studied by Fish et al."}
{"text":"In this work, we examine the non-perturbative renormalization of the chromo-magnetic operator in Heavy Quark Effective Theory. Upon computation of the two-loop anomalous dimension of the operator, we analyze its scale evolution between $\\mu \\approx 0.3$ GeV and $\\mu \\approx 100$ GeV using the lattice MS and MS-bar schemes. As an output of this endeavor, the bare lattice operator is converted to its renormalization group invariant form, which we applied to the B* - B mass splitting problem. Consequently, the previously obtained quenched predictions of this splitting are updated to be in line with the experimental values. Further, this renormalization factor is also applicable to the spin-dependent potentials of Eichten and Feinberg."}
{"text":"\nThis study examines the ability to detect the correlation between star formation in low-mass galaxies and 21cm emission during the reionization period. By combining measured fluctuations in Ly-alpha emission, which is used to denote star formation rate, with redshifted 21cm signals from intergalactic neutral hydrogen, we can further our understanding if stars are a major factor in reionizing the universe. We demonstrate that given a high enough angular resolution, space-based imaging of near-infrared Ly-alpha emission can be coupled with 21cm signal pick-up to detect a correlation on scales close to 10 arc-minutes. Additionally, when 21cm signal detection is combined with space-based near-IR imaging of Ly-alpha emission and a 2-meter small aperture optical telescope with 10 square-degree field of view, this correlation can be detected on scales greater than 3 arc-minutes, but is limited by how accurate foreground sky subtraction is."}
{"text":"This study presents new findings on the effect of stellar compactness on the non-axisymmetric instabilities of rapidly rotating neutron stars, utilizing numerical simulations in full General Relativity. By extrapolating the results of a previous study, we determine a threshold for the onset of the bar-mode instability for 59 different star models. Our conclusions are in line with the Newtonian expectation and improve previous post-Newtonian estimates. Additionally, we discover that for very massive and compact stars, the fastest-growing deformation is the m=3 mode. We illustrate that further to the Newtonian speculation, an m=1 deformation is bound to be a widespread late-time feature of non-axisymmetric instabilities."}
{"text":"\nThis work proposes a way to continuously divide red and white blood cells from their surrounding plasma in a miniature-scale system. The apparatus comprises a small tube, with a streaming-in area and different delivery sources, which incorporates magnetic instruments scattered, side meeting, and running through the tube. An outer magnetic field imparts a pressure on the cells while they go through the tube. The whole blood reactions diverge relying upon the hemoglobin's oxygenation, with the white blood cells demonstrating diamagnetic behavior and the red blood cells demonstrating diamagnetic or paramagnetic characteristics. Using a mathematical model to assess the pressure from the magnetic, liquid and gravity forces, the system turned out to be able of separating remarkably rich plasma in white blood cells, deoxygenated blood cells abundant in red blood cells and reduced cells plasma, into their separate outlets."}
{"text":"\nIn this article, we present a rigidity theorem regarding the action of the extended mapping class group $\\Gamma^*$ of a surface $S$ on the space of unmeasured foliations $\\mathcal{UMF}$ on $S$. Specifically, we consider $S$ to be a surface of finite type not equal to the sphere with four punctures or less, a torus with two punctures, or a closed surface with genus two. Further, we consider a dense subset $\\mathcal{D}$ (which is invariant under the action of $\\Gamma^*$) on $\\mathcal{UMF}$, which is the set of homotopy classes of not necessarily connected essential, disjoint and pairwise non-homotopic simple closed curves on $S$. We show that the restriction of $\\Gamma^*$'s action on $\\mathcal{D}$ is faithful, and that the restriction of the group of homeomorphisms $\\mathrm{Homeo}(\\mathcal{UMF})$'s action on $\\mathcal{D}$, also coincides with the action of $\\Gamma^*$."}
{"text":"\nWe use the Fourier technique in order to determine the redshift-space power spectrum for the maxBCG catalog of galaxy clusters (Koester et al. 2007). This is the largest cluster sample to have ever been analysed. By accounting for the blurring effect of photometric redshift errors and incorporating a treatment for the nonlinear effects, the model of the LambdaCDM cosmology, with its low-matter density, is seen to agree with the estimated power. With its wide volume of 0.4 h^{-3} Gpc^3, the recovered power spectrum has such a large signal-to-noise ratio that feeble evidence (a 2-sigma probability) is found for acoustic features. An excess of power on large scales, pointed out by other researchers, is left when photometric redshift errors are taken into account, as proposed in the work of Koester et al. This research bodes well for forthcoming large cluster surveys."}
{"text":"\nThe protein folding problem - determining the three-dimensional native structure of proteins solely from information about their amino acid sequence - is one of the most important yet unsolved problems in modern science. For this reason, physicists have increasingly begun to tackle this complex physical problem using mathematical and computational tools, as well as the expertise and insight of the physics discipline. This work aims to guide those new to this problem and provides an explanation of its importance and current status of research. An introduction to the particular structure of these biological macro-heteropolymers and the assumptions behind the physical definition of the problem are also included. Moreover, a thorough overview of the statistical mechanics most often used to study macromolecules' huge phase spaces is presented in order to facilitate a better understanding. A synthesis of literature on the subject provides for a comprehensive reference."}
{"text":"Recent research has investigated the universe as a Friedmann-Lema\\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) model, supported by a wealth of cosmologically significant data. This model strongly indicates a flat FLRW universe nearly equal parts matter and vacuum energy -- $\\Omega_{M} \\approx 0.27$, $\\Omega_{\\Lambda} \\approx 0.73$. While more precise data from Supernovae Ia in the range $1.5 < z < 1.8$ would support these findings, another independent cosmological metric also offers potential benefits. Determining the maximum value of the angular-diameter-distance -- its value for $\\Lambda \\neq 0$ or $\\Lambda = 0$ -- and the redshift at which this occurs has been identified as an appropriate measure. When $\\Lambda = 0$ and the FLRW model is flat, the redshift of maximum angular-diameter-distance gives a unique value for $\\Omega_{\\Lambda}$ without the need to factor in the Hubble parameter. By including the redshift, this measure can also determine values for $\\Omega_M$ and $\\Omega_{\\Lambda}$ for non-flat FLRW models provided the value for the Hubble parameter is determined independently. Ultimately, with an understanding of the maximum angular-diameter-distance and its redshift, it is possible to determine the flatness of the universe given a Friedmann-Lema\\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker model."}
{"text":"\nRecent progress in the simulation of small-scale magnetic fields has explored the intricate substructures on a scale of 0.1''. It appears that magnetic flux concentrations can extend in a vertical fashion through the atmosphere, resulting in a mechanical equilibrium with the surrounding field-free atmosphere. Advanced three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations have been able to recreate the curved shapes of these flux concentrations, as well as the asymmetric profile of the associated facular granules caused by radiative transfer. Models now also extend to encompass the full range of layers from the convection zone to the mid-chromosphere, signifying a dynamic chromospheric magnetic field marked by filaments of high field strength propagating within the compression zone along with shock fronts. As such, magnetic flux concentrations appear to expand through the photosphere and into a more homogeneous chromospheric field. Finally, this paper will touch upon recent works to give prospective directions for future simulations of small-scale magnetic fields."}
{"text":"\nThis paper investigates rank 1, nonpositively curved spaces by exploring hyperbolic rank rigidity results. We assume that along each geodesic in the compact, rank 1 manifold $M$ with nonpositive sectional curvature there is a parallel vector field that causes curvature to equal $-a^2$ in the direction of the geodesic. The results of this paper indicate that if $M$ is of odd dimension, or if it is even and the sectional curvature is pinched to be between -$\\Lambda^2$ and -$\\lambda^2$ (where $\\lambda \/ \\Lambda > 0.93$), the curvature of $M$ will be constant and equal to $-a^2$. This research confirms the result of Hyperbolic Rank Rigidity Theorem by Hamenst\\\"{a}dt when bounded from above by $-a^2$, and also provides a new result in other scenarios. We provide a rigidity result with only an assumption on maximal Lyapunov exponents similar to a previous work by Connell. The proof of the major theorem is simplified by assuming negative curvature, and outside of dimensions 7 and 8 the proof relies solely on ergodicity of the $(dim(M)-1)$-frame flow. For these 2 exceptional dimensions the 2-frame flow is used instead to develop a scheme for generalizing the result."}
{"text":"This paper outlines the results of a multipart work in which the combination of the Riemann Hypothesis (RH) and other hypotheses proposed by the author is used. The focus of this work is the Riemann zeta-function and its zeros. Specifically, a connection is established between the function's nth nonreal zero and its first derivative at that zero, in terms of the preceding zeros and the values of zeta at 1\/2 and at successive multiples of four. To illustrate this, two forms of a certain Laplace density \u2013 a meromorphic function constructed from zeta \u2013 are introduced. These functions, which play a key role in the work, have been proven to have analytic extensions across the entire complex plane. Furthermore, the positivity of the Laplace density is established, leading to the implications of RH, as well as the simplifying proposition that each nonreal zero of zeta is simple. Finally, a metric geometry expression of the positivity of the Laplace density is provided, as well as an analogous context for the Dirichlet L-functions and the Ramanujan tau Dirichlet function."}
{"text":"An analysis of the dynamical aspects of the 14 Her planetary system is presented here. Naef et al. (2004), Butler et al. (2006) and Wittenmyer et al. (2007) have previously identified a Jovian planet in a 1760 day orbit and a trend that may be due to a second, outer object. Through fundamental dynamical considerations, this paper tests the hypothesis that such an outer object is a Jovian planet with an orbital period of 13 AU or less. The optimal stable solution of this system features two Jovian planets with semi-major axes of 9 AU and orbital eccentricities ranging from 0 to 0.3, although other stable configurations are possible. The ratio between the two planets\u2019 masses can reverse at an orbital inclination of 30 degrees."}
{"text":"\nIn our study, we have developed an economical and effective method of separating the extragalactic population into component groups (Normal, Star-forming, AGN) based on color criteria. We have applied a color cut on the data generated in the greatest far-infrared survey ever conducted using AKARI (formerly ASTRO-F). By using the Far-Infrared Surveyor (FIS) from the AKARI satellite and MIR images from its Infrared Camera (IRC), we have been able to sort out certain galaxies like normal galaxies, starburst, and ULIRG. Our approach helps to quickly identify various source populations, including rare luminous objects, without having to invest too much time in ground-follow ups. These results provide a means of identifying specific source populations and generating colour-stratified source counts."}
{"text":"\nUsing precise radial velocity and astrometric observations, we have successfully estimated the dynamical mass for the presumed exoplanet companion of HD 33636. Observations obtained from the Hobby-Eberly Telescope at McDonald Observatory and the Hubble Space Telescope Fine Guidance Sensor 1r have allowed us to detect a perturbation period of 2117.3 +\/- 0.8 days and a semimajor axis of 14.2 +\/- 0.2 mas via modelling the radial velocity and astrometry data. The estimated parallax, proper motion and system inclination also match up with the Hipparcos values within the given uncertainties. Taking into account the estimated mass of the primary star and assuming no other companions in the vicinity, we were able to arrive at a total companion mass of 142 +\/- 11 M_jup, signifying that what was previously thought to be an exoplanet is actually a low-mass star. This result further emphasizes the importance of follow-up astrometric observations when attempting to accurately detect the true masses of exoplanets that were originally identified through radial velocities."}

{"text":"\nWe provide an estimate of the four-point amplitude in maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory at five loops, making use of the correspondence between integrals of simple conformal properties and the four-point amplitudes from the theory at four loops. Detailed steps to identify the mentioned integrals have been outlined. We employ both four- and D-dimensional generalized unitarity to figure out the coefficients of each integral in the amplitude. Maximal cuts have been utilized effectively to accurately determine the coefficients. This set of integrals and coefficients will help to calculate the cusp anomalous dimension at five-loops, and shall be instrumental in verifying the validity of the AdS\/CFT duality conjecture. Moreover, it will support a conjecture that the amplitudes possess an iterative structure which will contribute to the all-loop resummation and facilitate the comparison between the string-side computation by Alday and Maldacena and the amplitudes."}
{"text":"\nThis paper explores a new research approach of using pulsar observations to independently measure both the electron density and the magnetic field of the solar corona. Our method, which measures the Faraday rotation from the polarized emission from a number of pulsars, allows us to obtain integrated measurements of the electron density and the magnetic field. Consequently, these measurements enable us to determine the integrated magnetic field through the solar corona, without any need for an assumed electron density distribution. Results indicate that the Faraday rotation of the pulsar J1801$-$2304 increased by roughly 160 \\rad at an elongation of 0.95$^\\circ$ from the sun\u2019s centre, suggesting a minimum magnetic field strength of 393$\\mu$G along this line of sight. Although the precision of electron density measurement is not satisfactory, applying coronal plasma models can restrict the value to a range around 20mG along a path between 2.5 solar radii and the solar limb, which is in concordance with the Source Surface models published by Wilcox Solar Observatory."}
{"text":"  This paper presents a scheduling algorithm to optimize the expected completion time of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) subject to worker uncertainty. The algorithm seeks to assign tasks to workers in a manner that minimizes the time to complete the DAG. Conditions of worker uncertainty, such as tasks successfully being completed with a probability $p_{i,j}$ on worker $i$, are taken into consideration. In cases where the number of workers and the width of the DAG are both limited to constants, the algorithm runs in polynomial time. The problem can be shown to be NP-hard in cases where the width or number of workers can increase without bounds. Furthermore, the problem is inapproximable within a factor of 5\/4, assuming P $\\neq$ NP. This algorithm is useful in fields such as grid computing and project management."}
{"text":"\nThis article investigates the isospin asymmetry present in the excitations of the mirror nuclei $^{14}$O and $^{14}$C in the isoscalar (IS) formation, using Hartree-Fock(HF)+Random Phase Approximation (RPA) linear response theory with a Skyrme interaction in order to take into account the continuum effect properly. Results point out asymmetry in the IS monopole and dipole responses close to the particle threshold with respect to the excitation energy and strength. However, no similar result can be seen in the Giant Resonance (GR) region. Quadrupole cases show that the respective strengths of the mirror nuclei have almost the same energy dependence near the threshold and GR region. Analyzing the transition densities of the monopole response near the threshold show an extended halo structure, while GR response does not show any extended feature of the wave functions. The IS multipole strength distributions are compared with recent experiments from $\\alpha $ inelastic scattering results on the nucleus $^{14}$O."}
{"text":"\nAnalyses of conservation laws have previously been conducted to examine their impact on the accuracy of quantum computing operations. Such studies have yielded lower limits of error probabilities for a variety of logic operations. Nevertheless, the challenge of determining the exact lower bound for the implementation of a quantum NOT gate has yet to be resolved through such approaches. This paper introduces a new framework for addressing this issue. We analyze the trace distance between the output state resulting from the actual gate and that intended to be produced by the ideal quantum NOT gate. By employing orthogonal polynomials, we compute a general lower bound on the error probability related to realizations of the quantum NOT gate using control systems containing a certain number of qubits, in which the total angular momentum of the computation qubit plus the control will remain conserved along the dirction used to encode the own system. This lower bound proves to be more demanding than one expected from the previous results. Our new approach should assist with obtaining higher accuracies in other physical implementations of quantum computing operations where conservation laws are imposed, as well as help to answer questions such as the degree of accuracy achievable in programmable quantum processors."}
{"text":"\nThe present article performs a microscopic examination of a superconducting quantum critical point produced by a pair-breaking quantum phase transition. Through the use of a diagrammatic formalism for disordered systems, finite temperature crossovers in the electrical conductivity are derived in order to investigate superconducting fluctuations. It is essential to go beyond traditional approximations in order to completely capture the zero temperature correction due to quantum fluctuations and appropriately portray conductivity behavior in a low temperature quantum regime. All dynamic contributions, resulting in a negative total, put a hold on conductivity due to superconducting fluctuations. Contrastingly, the classical and intermediate regimes are mainly affected by the positive bosonic channel. Our theory, applicable in one, two and three dimensions, can be utilized with respect to experiments conducted on superconducting nanowires, doubly-connected cylinders, thin films and bulk materials in the presence of magnetic impurities, a magnetic field, or another pair-breaker. A possible window of non-monotonic behavior is predicted for when either temperature or the pair-breaking parameter is changed."}
{"text":"\nOur study of 3CR radio galaxies in the local (z<0.2) universe examines the impact of nuclear parameters, like black hole (BH) mass and photoionizing luminosity, on the FRI\/FRII transition. Our sample was seen with medium-resolution spectroscopy, yielding an average velocity dispersion of 216 km\/s, converting to a mean BH mass of roughly 2.5x10^8 Msun. We observed that galaxies of FRI morphology, plus those with low emission-line increases, have lesser BH masses combined with diminished photoionizing (and jet) luminosities - mirroring the Ledlow-Owen relation, which correlates radio and optical luminosity. In recasting the Ledlow-Owen correlation, we discovered that it fits our sample. Additionally, we observe a lessened luminosity need relative to Eddington luminosity for the FRI\/FRII interruption than for the X-ray binary soft-to-hard modification. Ultimately, we infer that the FRI\/FRII dichotomy is subject to both external and nuclear features, with the latter predominating."}

{"text":"\nIn this article, we explore the chiral transformation properties of baryon operators with two flavors for three quarks. We discuss how the color, Dirac and isospin Fierz transformations can lead to various relations between baryon fields with the same quantum numbers, leading to a reduced number of operators with a specific spin and isospin. The Fierz identities can also be used to limit the chiral multiplets of each baryon, with the chiral multiplet of a nucleon consisting of $(\\frac12,0)\\oplus(0,\\frac12)$ and a $\\Delta$ baryon having both $(1,\\frac12)\\oplus (\\frac12,1)$ and $(\\frac32,0)\\oplus(0,\\frac32)$.

{"text":"The Hall drift, or transport of magnetic flux by moving electrons producing an electrical current, may be the main factor leading to the evolution of the magnetic field in the solid crust of neutron stars. In this article, the Hall induction equation in axial symmetry is utilised to explore the nonlinear process that has still not been fully comprehended and understand the properties of non-evolving fields as well as the evolution of purely toroidal fields, their poloidal perturbations, and current-free, purely poloidal fields. Additionally, it is shown that the evolution of any toroidal magnetic field can be detailed through Burgers' equation. The stability of poloidal magnetic field is discussed and it is shown that these are stable and could be representatives of a long-term polarized crustal field, maintained by currents in the fluid stellar core."}
{"text":"An article titled 'Massive CP$^1$ Theory from a Microscopic Model for Doped Antiferromagnets' presents a detailed study of a two-dimensional t-J model with Dirac quantization, conducted to understand the effects of doping a colinear antiferromagnet. In the low doping limit, short-range antiferromagnetic order of spin degrees of freedom is assumed. A local spin quantization axis of the dopant fermions then gives rise to the staggered CP$^1$ fields, thereby resolving the double occupancy constraint. By subsequent splitting of slow and fast modes and integration of the fast modes and dopant fermions, a CP$^1$ field-theory including a massive gauge field is obtained. As a result, incommensurate coplanar magnetic structures are seen and the possibility of deconfined spinons is opened."}
{"text":"This paper examines the phenomenon of crystallization in large wireless networks with fading interference. We uncover how individual source-destination terminal pair capacities become strictly positive, as well as fading links converging to nonfading links, in the limit of increasing M, provided K grows accordingly. A large-deviations analysis is presented to characterize the rate of crystallization, and a new technique is developed to study the large-deviations behavior of certain sums of dependent random variables. Finally, results are obtained which show how the per source-destination terminal pair capacity converges to infinity in these networks."}
{"text":"\nThis presentation of brane induced gravity examines the 5D example in depth and discovers that 4D laws of gravity can be achieved in an extra space with an infinite volume where the issue of volume modal stability is absent. A pair of solutions have been identified - the conventional branch, which predicts a potentially testable graviton model within the Solar system, and self-accelerated branch, which could provide evidence that the accelerated expansion of the Universe is due to modified gravity effects. Whilst perturbative instability is evident in the self-accelerated branch, a single non-perturbative solution indicates a net negative gravitational mass, hinting at non-perturbative instability. To resolve this issue and allow for an open quantum gravity scale, an extension of the original model is proposed."}
{"text":"\nInclusive dijet and trijet production in deep inelastic $ep$ scattering has been recently monitored and tabulated for values of $10<Q^2<100$ GeV$^2$ and $x_{\\rm Bj}$ ranging from $10^{-4}$ to $10^{-2}$ at the HERA electron-proton collider. The dataset was obtained with a centre-of-mass energy of $\\sqrt{s}=318\\gev$ and assuming an integrated luminosity of $82 {\\rm pb}^{-1}$, while the $k_{T}$ cluster algorithm of the longitudinally invariant inclusive mode was used to identify jets in the hadronic centre-of-mass frame. To examine the impact of such low $x_{\\rm Bj}$ dynamics, measurements of the multi-differential jet cross sections as functions of jet correlations in transverse momenta, azimuthal angles and pseudorapidity were presented along with dijet and trijet differential cross sections depending on $Q^2$, $x_{\\rm Bj}$, jet transverse energy and jet pseudorapidity. Predictions of $\\mathcal{O}(\\alpha_{s}^3)$ hadron-level Monte Carlo event generators were also compared to the findings, with a generally good agreement in the trijet sector and improved description of the dijet data compared to $\\mathcal{O}(\\alpha_{s}^2)$ predictions."}
{"text":"\nThis article examines some spin effects that arise from quantum chromodynamics and recurrent lattices with multiple exchange sites. We explore the critical phenomena that occur in spin systems on recurrence lattices and use the method of recursive lattices to understand the magnetic behaviors of both $^3$He fluids and solids, and phase transitions in crystals and macromolecules. We analyze the helix-coil phase transition of polypeptides and proteins and look into the quasi-unfolding transition (like the cold denaturation process) concerning the helicity order parameter. We then look into the recurrent models of $^3$He defined on the square, Husimi, and hexagon lattices and calculate magnetization curves with plateaus, bifurcation points, and one period doubling. After that, we observe a complex structure of phase transitions between the disordered, partially ordered, and completely ordered states in models featuring cubic symmetry and linear or quadratic spin-spin interactions defined on the Bethe lattice. For quantum chromodynamics, we look at the azimuthal asymmetries in deep inelastic lepton-nucleon scattering and calculate the next-to-leading order in heavy-quark initiated contributions to this scattering. It is determined that the photon-quark scattering mechanism is independent of the $\\cos2\\phi$ asymmetry, unlike the basic gluon-initiated component. Last, we study the possibility of measuring both non-perturbative and perturbative charm distributions with the $\\cos2\\phi$ asymmetry."}
{"text":"\nThis paper looks at the issue of estimating the true distribution of flow sizes in internet traffic. Current methods of data sampling can only measure certain system parameters, but can be further augmented through the use of statistical methods. Sample-and-hold is proposed, implemented and tested, which is able to hold all subsequent packets in a flow if a packet is sampled. Consequently, the sample-and-hold method is able to be reversed, providing an informative statistical flow inversion capable of accurately reconstructing the genuine distribution of flow sizes in network traffic. Real network traces are used to test the different methods and to compare the results."}
{"text":"\nThis article discusses the various ways that one-dimensional structures can be formed and examines how the metallic state of a 1D solid can result in charge-ordering phenomena due to strong correlations as the temperature is lowered. The competition between interactions ultimately drives the system to become insulating, and the research will highlight how dielectric and optical measurements can identify the broken-symmetry ground states that occur. It is argued that organic conductors provide an excellent model to understand the physics in reduced dimensions."}
{"text":"\nThis research article discusses the development of a prospective electrostatic Space Elevator climber that utilizes a state-of-the-art electrostatic linear engine previously presented at the 42nd Joint Propulsion Conference (AIAA-2006-5229) and published in AEAT, Vol. 78, No. 6, 2006, pp. 502-508. The climber's capability to achieve any speed (including controlled braking) is enabled by delivering the energy for movement from a lightweight high-voltage line connected to an Earth-based electrical generator. This line is also capable of transmitting electric energy to a Geosynchronous Space Station. The current best solution to the Space Elevator climber problem, announced by NASA as one of the key projects for developing a Space Elevator, still presents certain difficulties. Examples of two projects utilizing the linear electrostatic engine are also included as potential power space launchers, demonstrated through AIAA-2007-5838 for the 43rd Joint Propulsion Conference, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA, 9-11 July 2007."}
{"text":"\nIn this paper, we consider the potential of distinguishing between a cosmological constant and a dynamically evolving quintessence field if future dark energy surveys constrain the equation of state to be consistent with -1 to a percent level accuracy. We first analyze the model-independent trajectories available in 'energy' phase-space, and find that two classes of acceptable models result from the attractor dynamics: those representing an effective cosmological constant, and those with potentials that abruptly flatten with a distinct kink. Although the former models cannot be further probed using distance measurements or the growth of fluctuations at low redshift (z<3), models of the latter type exist in which the dark energy exhibits an observable impact at high redshift. These can be examined further by examining cosmic microwave background anisotropies and primordial nucleosynthesis. Therefore, we conclude that it is feasible to identify models in which dark energy has measurable effects even when w is constrained to be close to -1."}
{"text":"\nThis paper explores and presents a branch and cut algorithm suitable for computing the halfspace depth of a given set of points and a point p, where the halfspace depth is the minimum number of points of the set contained in any closed halfspace with p on its boundary. The Chinneck heuristic algorithm is used to obtain an upper bound, and a related technique based on sensitivity analysis is employed for branching. Furthermore, IIS (Irreducible Infeasible Subsystem) hitting set cuts are formulated in the algorithm and a binary search is suggested as an alternative numerical strategy. The algorithms are implemented using the BCP framework from the COIN-OR project."}
{"text":"We explore the dynamics of still and slowly-moving, phase-coherent intrinsic excitations (breathers) in a two-chain system composed of weakly-connected nonlinear oscillators. Through a series of analytical and numerical studies, we analyze the motion of these breathers; specifically, we distinguish between a low-amplitude, periodic transversal translation (wandering) and a high-amplitude localization to one of the chains. By mapping this to the equation of a single pendulum, we are able to identify two solutions that are then separated by a separator mode. Additionally, we analyze two-chain breathers which appear as bound states of the interacting chains, and investigate their bifurcation when these discrete breathers enter into a different phase. Finally, we describe this delocalizing transition of one-dimensional breathers in systems of multiple parallel-coupled chains, and demonstrate that there is an analogy to the delocalization of Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) in optical lattices of two and three dimensions."}
{"text":"\nA supercritical series expansion methodology has been utilized to study the survival probabilities of a one-dimensional contact process in heterogeneous and disordered lattices. Binary regular and irregular lattices of nodes that feature different recovery rates and identical transmission rates have been used to model the mentioned heterogeneity and disorder. Critical points and critical exponents $\\beta$ for the contact process have been extracted by implementing Nested Pad\\'e and Partial Differential approximants to expansions with two variables. The resulting critical exponents for the heterogeneous environment have been seen to be consistent with the homogeneous contact process, verifying the directed percolation universality class. On the other hand, the disordered systems tend to have continuously varying exponents."}
{"text":"This article investigates the significance of scattering line polarization for exploring the quiet regions of the solar atmosphere. By utilizing multilevel models and calculating the linear polarization produced by scattering processes, we assess the effect of collisions with neutral hydrogen on the thirteen lines in multiplet 42 of Ti I and on the K line and IR triplet of Ca II, focusing on the exchange of energy levels caused by these collisions. Though this depolarization affects the ${\\lambda 4536$ line of Ti I significantly, its effect on the other lines is minimal. We also find that the depolarization of the Ca II lines is barely noticeable. This research offers further understanding of the thermal and magnetic structure of the quiet regions of the solar atmosphere."}
{"text":"\nIn this paper, we discuss the numerical simulation of high energy cosmic ray (above $10^{15}$ eV) propagation through a complex magnetic field composed of a large-scale component and a turbulent component in order to explore potential relevant effects to the problem. We identify a number of effects that are difficult to interpret in a diffusive approach while making an important contribution to Cosmic Ray diffusion in the complex field of the Galaxy. We further assess the effect of this simulation on confinement time of cosmic rays and its dependence on particle rigidity, which is integral in determining source spectra, light element production by spallation, and anisotropy in cosmic ray propagation. These results will be presented and discussed in detail in subsequent paper."}
{"text":"\nFor 10 years, the Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) has been observing the 8.7-second Anomalous X-ray Pulsar 4U 0142+61. The pulsar has experienced a stable rate of rotation from March 2000 to February 2006, resulting in a RMS phase residual of 2.3% with a model that incorporates nu, nudot, and nuddot. Possible phase-coherent temporary solutions have been identified for a span of time extending back to March 1996. While a glitch may have occurred within the last 10 years, there is currently no evidence to support it. The pulse profile of this pulsar has been evolving since 2000, with the dip of emission between its two peaks decreasing in size since 2002. This possibly reveals an event that may have transpired prior to 2000 that included the proposed glitch. The variations in the pulse profile have only been detected in the 2-4 keV range and not 6-8 keV. A steady rise of 36% in the pulsed flux has been detected between 2.6 years in the range of 2-10 keV. These changes in the pulsed flux and narrow-band profile lend credence to certain features of the Magnetar model."}
{"text":"\nIn this study, the capacity of social structure to affect altruistic behavior was investigated using an evolutionary model. Specifically, the dynamics of individuals playing the Ultimatum Game with their neighbors on a social network of interaction was explored. As a result of this investigation, it was found that a self-organizing population appears in a critical state, in which levels of altruism are linked to the topology of the social structure. In general, those individuals offering large shares and accepting large shares were removed from the population. For heterogeneous social networks, those offering intermediate shares were strongly selected; however, in contrast, random homogeneous networks revealed that a wide array of offers underneath a certain critical limit were similarly present in the population."}

{"text":"This article examines the accuracy of synthetic stellar libraries by comparison with observation. The models are evaluated based on both broad-band colours and high resolution spectral features. The comparison of the model atmospheres, flux distributions, and UBVRIJHK calibration show that models perform comparatively well, with the exceptions of U-B colour and V-K > ~3 stars. Although the direct comparison between models and observations introduces uncertainties, the three libraries generally exhibit similar behaviour and deviations. An improved list of atomic and molecular line opacities is needed, especially in the blue and for cool stars below 4500K."}

{"text":"This article provides an overview of the wide range of CP violation from the Standard Model to strings. It considers non-supersymmetric 4D extensions, supersymmetric models such as complex mSUGRA, 5D models and models built upon warped geometry. It is established that CP violation beyond the standard model is necessary for baryon asymmetry through baryogenesis and leptogenesis, and moreover influences a plethora of particle physics phenomena such as electric dipole moments and $g-2$, relic density and neutralino dark matter detection rates, Yukawa unification and sparticle production in both grand unified and string based models and CP violating Higgs mixings. The current experimental status of CP violation and emerging possibilities in the future are noted."}
{"text":"\nThis article explores the effects of imperfect channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) on the performance of bit-interleaved coded multiple beamforming (BICMB) schemes. Although most studies of limited-rate CSIT assume the precoding matrix has an invariance property, this is not the case for BICMB. The authors propose a new distortion measure which is optimal under a diagonal unitary transform and, by employing the generalized Lloyd algorithm for codebook design, achieve a performance improvement for receivers with linear detectors. Simulation results show that these receivers have equal performance for perfect CSIT, but different results for imperfect CSIT."}
{"text":"\nA reevaluation of the Constrained MSSM has been performed in light of newly revised constraints, with special focus on the consequences of a large variation in the Standard Model estimation of BR(B to X_s gamma). Through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo scanning system to sample different parameters in the MSSM, we studied the posterior probability maps to check the preferred case of $\\mu> 0$ and develop an understanding of the challenges for $\\mu<0$.The focus point region shows strong preference in both cases, which consequently has a definite impact on the prospects for observing neutralino dark matter and superpartner searches. Tevatron and LHC searches related to the lightest Higgs boson are unaffected, and provide opportunities to gain access to the focus point region otherwise hard to probe. An alternative global fit measure demonstrates that current data are not definitive enough for definite conclusions. Aspects like alternative priors and other assumptions are also discussed."}
{"text":"We utilize a Suzaku observation to study the metallicity of the intracluster medium in two adjacent clusters of galaxies - A399 and A401 - up to their respective virial radii. Our analysis is the first to measure the ICM metallicity at the clustered virial limit, and the results suggest a uniformity and high metallicity that cannot be the result of ram-pressure stripping from the member galaxies. Instead, this is evidence of Galactic Superwinds existing in the region before the clusters formed, indicating intense metal pollution of the proto-cluster region. Along with this, an upper limit of hydrogen density was established at nH<4.1x10^-5 cm^-3."}
{"text":"This article looks at the frequency distributions of the semi-major axes of wide binaries in order to provide an understanding of the process of star formation and the dynamical evolution of the systems. It takes several sources into account, such as Poveda et al. (1994), Allen et al. (2000) and Poveda & Hernandez (2003). It is concluded that the frequency of these binaries depends on the age of the system, and follows Oepik's distribution f(a) ~ 1\/a in the range of 100 AU < a < a(t), beyond which binaries have likely dissociated due to interactions with other massive objects. Moreover, the frequency distribution of mass ratios in triple systems, as well as the presence of runaway stars, may suggest that both violent and secular relaxations are important influences in the development of binary and multiple stars."}
{"text":"\nBy using a trapping method involving magnetically trapped neutral Rb-87 atoms, this paper outlines a technique to measure the magnitude and even the direction of electric fields generated from surface contaminants. Our method applies an external alternating electric field to resonantly drive the trapped atoms into a mechanical dipole oscillation, and the growth rate of the amplitude of this oscillation allows us to identify the intensity and sign of the stray field. Using this approach, we demonstrate the ability to accurately reconstruct the vector electric fields from substances adsorbed onto the surface and account for systematic errors associated with such measurements. In addition, we find that baking the substrate may reduce the fields coming from adsorbates, likely due to surface diffusion rather than desorption."}

{"text":"\nBy studying nine weak MgII quasar absorption line systems at redshifts of 1.4-2.4 with the Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph on the Very Large Telescope, we investigate whether there are differences in the physical properties of weak MgII absorbers at varying redshifts. Our results show that the densities, metallicities, Doppler parameters, and column densities remain the same across redshifts 0.4-2.4. The number of weak MgII absorbers decreases from z~1 to z~2, however, because the physical properties do not change significantly, the decrease may be attributed to a decrease in activity rather than a change in formation process. We find evidence for multiple, velocity aligned clouds in single cloud weak MgII absorbers, which could be of extragalactic origin, such as dwarf galaxies or high velocity clouds."}
{"text":"\nThis article presents an examination of the geometrical qualities, directions, and arrangements of dark matter subhalos occupying the Via Lactea galactic simulation of an LCDM version of our Milky Way. Unlike isolated dark matter halos, subhalos are found to be mostly triaxial but more round in shape than the host halo, with small-to-major and medium-to-major axis ratios of 0.68 and 0.83 respectively. The principal axis ratios demonstrate to be impartial to subhalo bulk, however, when shapes are measured within a predicted tangible dimension. Subhalos about the core of the host halo are commonly observed as having slightly increased roundness. The spatial arrangement of subhalos reveal the shape of the host halo when selected according to their peak V_max previously experienced before they underwent substantial tidal alteration. Their position is found to have a correlation to the focus of the host halo as the greater axis has a tendency to realign in that direction. This correlation shatters after 3r_200, yet its more visible where the shape is measured in the outer regions. These strong host tidal interventions are the dynamics responsible for making subhalos rounder eventually."}
{"text":"\nWe investigated the distributions of an assortment of LMC clusters which are of intermediate age. Utilising ISPI on the CTIO 4m, deep near-infrared imaging enabled us to determine the K-band brightness of the core helium burning red clump stars of the selected clusters. With the ages and metallicities of the clusters coupled with the research of Grocholski & Sarajedini, we were able to calculate the absolute K-band red clump magnitude of the clusters to ultimately ascertain the clusters' distances. Upon examination, the plotted cluster locations agreed with the thick, inclined disk geometry of the LMC as defined by its field stars. The arrangement of the aged globular clusters also conformed to the same pattern, a finding that reveals the disk of the LMC is probably somewhere around 13 Gyr old. We used our discovered cluster distances connected with the disk geography to calculate the distance of the LMC core, yielding (m-M)o = 18.40 +\/- 0.04_{ran} +\/- 0.08_{sys}, or Do = 47.9 +\/- 0.9 +\/- 1.8 kpc."}
{"text":"This study presents a comprehensive analysis of the surface photometry of 44 isolated spiral galaxies drawn from the Catalogue of Isolated Galaxies, using multicolor broad band BVRI photometry. Several structural\/morphological parameters, total magnitudes and colors at various circular apertures, were estimated. Morphology evaluation was completed using optical and sharp\/filtered R band images, color index maps, and near-IR JHK images from the Two-Micron Survey. Concentration, Asymmetry, and Clumpiness parameters were calculated for each band, with 63% of galaxies in the sample displaying optical\/near-IR bars and 17% showing evidence of weak or suspected bars. The structural parameters revealed changes with observable band, displaying trends along morphological type and global color. Samples of isolated and interacting spirals were compared in the A-S plane and revealed clear differences. This data was collected for comparison of environmental effects, model predictions of galaxy evolution, and to evaluate changes in galaxy properties with redshift."}
{"text":"This paper focuses on the operator-valued Schur-class, which is a set of holomorphic functions $S$ that maps the unit disk into the space of contraction operators between two Hilbert spaces. There are numerous characterizations for the Schur-class, including the fact that it satisfies a von Neumann inequality, the operator of multiplication by $S$ defining a contraction operator between two Hardy Hilbert spaces, an associated operator-valued kernel being positive-definite, and the transfer function of a dissipative or conservative discrete-time linear input\/state\/output linear system. More recently, multivariable generalizations of the Schur class have been introduced, most broadly by Muhly and Solel, who replaced the unit disk with the stricter unit ball of elements of a dual correspondence $E^{\\sigma}$ linked to a $W^{*}$-correspondence $E$ over a $W^{*}$-algebra $\\cA$ with a $*$-representation $\\sigma$ of $\\cA$. The main contribution of this paper is to introduce the notion of reproducing kernel Hilbert correspondences and equivalently associate the Muhly-Solel Hardy spaces with a completely positive Szeg\\\"o kernel. In this way, the Muhly-Solel Schur class is able to be better relationed to the classical Schur class. Additionally, the discussed theories are illustrated in various special cases, often resulting in novel realization theorems."}
{"text":"\nIn this article we investigate the behaviour of spin, charge and bond order correlations in a one-dimensional Hubbard Hamiltonian when it is subjected to static and dynamic effects from the lattice. The static distortion of the lattice produces a tendency for a charge density wave to be prominent in the phase diagram rather than antiferromagnetic order.  We discover that, in the dynamic lattice scenario (i.e. the Hubbard-Holstein model), similar behaviour can be seen, even though the charge asymmetry needs to spontaneously emerge. In addition, the individual components of the total energy experience sharp changes at phase boundaries. We ultimately observe a tendency for bond order between the charge and spin density wave subdomains."}
{"text":"\nWe continue to explore the non-metric theory of gravity that was introduced in hep-th\/0611182 and gr-qc\/0703002 and we discuss the general spherically symmetric vacuum solution. This solution bears some resemblance to the Schwarzschild solution, with slight but notable power-law corrections to Newton's potential. However, the theory forbids arbitrarily small black holes, as extreme curvature would prevent the formation of the horizon. We present three effects that can be attributed to this gravity, including corrections to Newton's law near the source, renormalizing the gravitational and cosmological constants at large distances from the source, and an additional redshift factor between spatial regions of different curvature. The first two effects could be used to explain observed anomalies with the Pioneer spacecraft and the alleged missing mass in spiral galaxies and other astrophysical objects. The third effect could explain the anomalously high redshifts of quasars and gamma-ray bursts without requiring a cosmological origin."}
{"text":"\nWe have detected periodic (with a 1.96 hour period) and extremely bright bursts of circularly polarized, coherent radio emission originating from the M9 star TVLM 513-46546. Concurrent photometric monitoring has confirmed this period to be the rotation period of the star. These recurrent and powerful bursts, which have not been seen in any previous observations of the star, demonstrate that ultracool dwarfs can generate a persistent level of radio emission associated with strong magnetic fields organized in a large-scale and stable configuration. The bursts come from highly concentrated spots around the magnetic poles, generated by the same mechanism responsible for the planetary radio emission of our own Solar System. These beams of radiation go through the line of sight and create the observed periodic bursts. This makes TVLM 513-46546 the prototype of a whole new class of transient radio sources, similar to the periodic light pulses caused by pulsar radio emission."}
{"text":"\nThis paper reviews the discovery of Dwork that the zeta-function of an\narithmetic variety defined over a field with p elements is a superdeterminant.\nWe investigate this observation in the context of a one-parameter family of\nquintic threefolds, looking at the zeta-function in terms of the parameter\n\\phi.

{"text":"  This article examines the cosmological evolution of a tachyon scalar field T with a Dirac-Born-Infeld type lagrangian and potential V(T) which is interacted with a canonically normalized scalar field \\phi. We focus on the influence of the barotropic fluid (which can be matter or radiation) on the system, and the interaction term B(T,\\phi). We have shown that only three parameters, L1, L2, and L3 determine the dynamics, and conditions to produce homogeneous density. We further examine how the equation of state for the tachyon field alters due to the interaction, revealing a possibility of tachyon matter redshifting as radiation when B is activated, hence resolving the problem of tachyonic matter."}
{"text":"This paper looks at how message throughput, measured as the rate that peers obtain content, is reduced due to the fluctuating nature of peer-to-peer networks. The Engset model is used to analyze the effect of continuous peers entering and leaving the system.

The resultant Instantaneous Message Exchange (IME) model provides parameters for a more detailed exploration of more complex systems. Analytical expressions for the fluctuating system are presented and demonstrate their effectiveness in replicating the behaviour of the system, showing the potential for peer-to-peer systems to be optimized to accommodate the dynamic environment."}
{"text":"\nWe have identified a new nearby LSB galaxy, SDSS J121811.0+465501.2, with a low estimated oxygen abundance and a B-band central surface brightness of 23.68 mag arcsec^2^. This discovery was made following the automated recognition and classification of the two extragalactic H II regions, SDSS J121811.0+465501.2 and SDSS J135440.5+535309.6, in the SDSS-DR4 database. The optical spectra of these regions display strong [O III]4959, 5007, and Balmer emission lines, but very weak [N II]6548,6583 and [S II]6317,6731 lines - suggesting metal-poor star formation. The H II region SDSS J121811.0+465501.2 is located in a nearly edge-on disc galaxy, with a redshift of z~0.00157, a disk scale-length of ~0.40 kpc, and an absolute magnitude of M_B ~ -13.51 mag. These measurements of the oxygen abundance and the LSB galaxy's properties support the hypothesis that low metallicities are found in LSB galaxies."}
{"text":"\nThis paper examines Hawking radiation from black holes situated within de Sitter spaces, including the purely de Sitter black hole, static spherically symmetric Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole, and rotating Kerr-de Sitter black hole. Robinson and Wilczek's work on compensating energy momentum tensor fluxes in order to cancel gravitational anomalies at the event horizon(EH) of Schwarzschild-type black holes are taken as a starting point. It is determined that energy momentum tensor fluxes at both the event horizon(EH) and de Sitter cosmological horizon(CH) result in gauge and gravitational anomalies that act to restore gauge invariance and general coordinate covariance. The origin of the gauge and gravitational anomalies at the cosmological horizon(CH) is generated by the effective field theory within CH to get rid of the outbound modes."}
{"text":"\nThe aim of this study was to explore the mechanism that drives jets and outflows during the star formation process. Utilizing resistive MHD nested grid simulations, the authors calculated the evolution of the molecular cloud to stellar core. It was found that two distinct flows exist in the collapsing cloud core: Low-velocity flows (5 km\/s) of wide opening angle, driven by the adiabatic core, and high-velocity flows (30 km\/s) of narrow opening angle, driven by the protostar. Magnetic fields around the adiabatic core are strong and shaped like an hourglass; thus, they are able to propel the flow via the magnetocentrifugal mechanism and guide it along hourglass-like field lines. The magnetic forces around the protostar are weaker and the field lines straighter, pointing to magnetic pressure gradient force and straight field lines as the main drivers of the flow. The difference of depths of the gravitational potential between the adiabatic core and the protostar contributes to the distinct velocities of the two flows; the low-velocity flow is thought to manifest itself as observed molecular outflows, while the high-velocity ones can be seen as optical jets. All in all, this study suggests that the outflow and the jet are driven by different regions in the core, and not that the outflow is entrained by the jet."}
{"text":"This article, in combination with its prequel, Part I, reveals how two index 1 pseudoholomorphic curves U_+ and U_- can be joined to form a single index 2 pseudoholomorphic curve in a symplectization of a contact 3-manifold. Such gluing can be done when the total multiplicity of the negative ends of U_+ at covers of an embedded Reeb orbit gamma is equivalent to the  total multiplicity of the positive ends of U_- at covers of the same gamma, even if the individual multiplicities vary. The article then shows how a signed count of such gluings is equivalent to a signed count of zeroes of a certain section of an obstruction bundle over the moduli space of branched covers of the cylinder. Other useful lemmas concerning the generic behavior of pseudoholomorphic curves in symplectizations are also discussed in the article, which can be of independent interest."}
{"text":"\nIn this article, we have developed a model to understand plasma effects in a micromachined High Electron Mobility Transistor (HEMT) with a microcantilever serving as the gate. The model takes into consideration the mechanical movement of the microcantilever, as well as the spatial and temporal variations of the Two-Dimensional Electron Gas (2DEG) system present in the transistor channel. To describe the microcantilever motion, the point-mass approximation was adopted. A hydrodynamic electron transport model was used to mimic plasma phenomena in the 2DEG. Using the model, we studied the response of the microcantilever oscillations and output signal as functions of signal frequency and bias voltage for various device parameters. We also analyzed voltage dependences of resonance frequency and its damping. We found that the signal amplitudes and microcantilever oscillations exhibit maxima at voltages close to the depletion voltage, followed by a steep drop as the bias voltage increases."}
{"text":"\nIn order to reduce the casualty of road accidents, experts on radar and remote sensing systems have proposed the utilization of an intelligent transport system (ITS). By taking advantage of wireless technology, the global accident rate can be reduced by 8-10% annually. In order to effectively deliver the intended results, the chosen wireless technology must be able to cope with the extensive amount of interference present in an open road. Therefore, FHSS (Frequency-hopping Spread Spectrum) with a space-diversity system, running at 5.8 GHz ISM band, delivering a bandwidth of 80 MHz, is the preferred option. By characterizing the radio channel, two operational modes were chosen \u2013 Communication and Radar. The latter offers a conditioned measurement of the nearest car, thus ensuring accuracy and reliability. To guarantee simultaneous operations, a Software-Defined Radio approach was adopted for its agility and speed."}
{"text":"This paper explores the SIR dynamics in random networks with heterogeneous connectivity, providing a straightforward method for modeling the spread of an epidemic. Using the probability generating function (PGF) formalism and network-centric variables such as the number of edges of a particular kind, I create a set of equations to describe the incidence, speed, and the final size of an epidemic. This is validated through comparison to stochastic simulations, which show good agreement with the theory. The equations can also be used to calculate the epidemic threshold, i.e., the point where large-scale outbreaks may occur. Results demonstrate the dramatic effects of degree distributions, particularly power law degree distributions, on the outcomes of an epidemic."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate the long-term changes in the optical spectral behaviour of BL Lacertae using the B and R-band light curves of the WEBT collaboration. We find that the spectral slope and flux of the source follows a power-law relation such that its spectrum becomes increasingly blue with increased source flux. Additionally, further spectral changes are evident during smaller-amplitude events, which are found to take place over a few day timescales. We additionally measure a slight chromatism in the long-term variations where the B-band flux increases\/decreases faster than the R-band flux. Our data also suggests a 4-day relative lag between the fluctuations in flux and the resulting variations in the spectral shape of the object, which may be caused by connectivity in the curved, inhomogeneous emitting jet."}
{"text":"\nUsing numerical models, we demonstrate the connectedness of fast and slow CMEs, which have commonly been assumed to be distinct phenomena. Our simulations indicate that the acceleration profile of a CME is linked to the steepness of the decline in the field strength above the flux rope within the region, where steeper declines are associated with active regions, thus allowing for faster CMEs, while gentler declines, as seen in the quiet Sun, correlate with slower CMEs. Additionally, our results show that the fastest CMEs occur in the most complex active regions, characterized by a quadrupolar magnetic field."}
{"text":"\nWe analyze the moduli space of marginal deformations of Closed Bosonic String Field Theory at polynomial order five. Using the results, we find a fit of the amplitudes and employ it to compute the effective potential of tachyons and dilatons in the limit of infinite level, which accurately predicts the vacuum of polynomial order four. This suggests the effective potential, to a set order, is a good approximation of the full potential, inclusive of all interactions and vertices up to this order, when truncated from the original string field. After computing the potential to fifth order, we observe multiple saddle points, including the Yang-Zwiebach vacuum and a local minimum, and probe any associated physical meanings."}
{"text":"\nEpidemiological forecasting on dynamic contact networks, which involve individuals frequently making and severing social or sexual connections, is challenging. Here we introduce a mathematical approach to predict disease transmission on such networks. Our model interpolates smoothly between static network models and mass-action models using a mixing parameter, thereby providing a bridge between disparate classes of epidemiological models. We provide a demonstration of the utility of this method with data collected from an Atlanta high school. Our research suggests that dynamic contact patterns can heavily influence an epidemic's dynamics, and should be considered in epidemiological forecasting and outbreak control in these settings."}
{"text":"This investigation seeks to gain a better understanding of electrical excitation of electrically driven plasma waves in two-dimensional electron channels and their propagation patterns. Hydrodynamic equations of electron transport are used along with a two-dimensional Poisson equation to predict the behaviour of shock and soliton-like waves resulting from strongly nonuniform initial electron density distributions of the channel. Our findings suggest that the nature of the shock wave front and the shape of the soliton-like pulses depend on certain factors such as the coefficient of viscosity, the thickness of the gate layer, and the nonuniformity of donor distributions along the channel. It is observed that electron collisions with impurities and phonons induce damping of the aforementioned waves, however have only minimal effect on the thickness of the shock wave front."}
{"text":"In this paper, we explore the algebraic closedness of real geodesics on n-dimensional ellipsoids. We determine that the closedness condition is transcendental in the parameters (semiaxes of the ellipsoid and constants of motion), except in the case when the real and imaginary geodesics are both closed. We jump to the next step of discovering the density of algebraically closed geodesics with respect to the parameter space in the (2n)-dimensional real space. We further analyse the period mapping for that of triaxial ellipsoids and present some explicit examples of families of algebraically closed geodesics."}
{"text":"\nRecently, Alday and Maldacena applied the AdS\/CFT correspondence to derive an equation for computing all planar amplitudes from string theory in N=4 supersymmetric gauge theory at strong coupling. This expression had a universal exponential factor that contained the action of the classical string. Previous calculations had only been made with specific external particle helicities -- the maximal helicity violating or MHV amplitudes. This article studies the impact of changes in external particle helicities and types on the amplitudes. We propose that the strong coupling limit of these amplitudes should be the same as their Yang-Mills tree-level counterparts with the added multiplier of the universal exponential. Our conclusion is that, in the strong coupling limit, all MHV and non-MHV scattering amplitudes will be identical to the known tree-level amplitudes multiplied by a helicity-independent, particle-type-independent, universal exponential."}
{"text":"This article studies classical lattice gas spin models featuring $n$-component ($n=2,3$) spins on $D$-dimensional ($D=2,3$) lattices with one particle per site. Each particle has a ferromagnetic interaction with its neighboring particles, and is controlled by a chemical potential $\\mu$. Mean field and two-site cluster treatments, as well as Grand-Canonical Monte Carlo simulations (when $\\mu=0$ for $D=2$ and $D=3$) were all previously used to study the models and showed a similar critical behaviour as their saturated lattice counterparts. In this paper, we address the case when $\\mu$ is negative and sufficiently large using Grand-Canonical Monte Carlo simulations, and find evidence of first order transitions for $D=2$ and $D=3$. We also compare our findings to recent experimental results."}
{"text":"\nIn this paper, we address the issue of Kempf's distortion function and Tian-Yau-Zelditch (TYZ) asymptotic expansion for the Kepler manifold, a noncompact manifold which is an important example. We draw motivation from recent results on compact manifolds and develop an exact formula: finite TYZ asymptotic expansion of $n-1$ terms, along with exponentially small error terms uniformly approaching infinity with respect to both the discrete quantization parameter $m$ and $\\rho$ (polar radius in $\\C^n$). We explicitly calculate the coefficients involved and find them to be homogeneous functions of the polar radius in the Kepler manifold. Additionally, we derive an asymptotic expansion of the obstruction term with coefficients given by geometrical quantities. We prove the sharpness of our estimates by analyzing the nonharmonic behavior of $T_m$ and the error term of the approximation of the Fubini--Study metric by $m \\omega$ as $m \\to \\infty$. The proofs herein combine geometrical, quantization and functional analytic techniques in the framework of analytic-Gevrey spaces."}
{"text":"\nWe consider the quantum electrodynamics of a two-level system endowed with a magnetic moment, or a qubit, interacting with the quantized electromagnetic field. We exploit the analogy between the Dirac electron in relativistic QED and the two-level system, expressed through second-quantized fermionic operators, to employ all the powerful tools of QED in this simplified form. Using the Feynman diagrams and propagators, we calculate the atomic polarizability and the dynamic single-spin susceptibility perturbatively up to the fourth order. These calculations investigate ambiguities encountered in the phenomenological approach, such as the sign prescription and optical damping. Moreover, we extend the methods to many-level systems (qudits), exemplifying with an atom with four relevant states--one S state and three degenerate P states."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate the role of massive perturbers such as giant molecular clouds and clusters in speeding up the processes that lead to the formation and decay of binary massive black holes (MBHs) within galactic cores post-merger. Our preliminary results show that these MPs significantly accelerate the two-body stellar relaxation process, which is typically required for the coalescence of binary MBHs. Through 3-body interactions with stars, MPs are able to effectively shrink the binary MBH and thus the emission of gravitational waves (GW, leading to rapid merging) is increased. We explore the impact of such massive perturbing bodies in the merging process of galactic nuclei, since this increases the rate of GW events observable, reduces the mass deficit of the post-merger galactic core, and can help prevent the formation of triple MBH systems and the unwanted ejection of MBHs into intergalactic space."}

{"text":"\nThis paper examines the structural modifications in the set of solutions of random constraint satisfaction problems as the amount of constraints increases. In particular, it looks at the behavior around the freezing transition, where variables take the same value in the different clusters of a given solution.

An analysis is done of the random tree ensembles, and then the validity of these results for the original random constraint satisfaction problem is discussed by using the cavity method."}
{"text":"\nThis study examines the 3He(alpha,gamma)7Be reaction, which boasts the largest nuclear physics uncertainty when determining the flux of 8B and 7Be neutrinos. To accurately measure the S-factor at low energy, we implemented both prompt and delayed gamma detection approaches, achieved at the Gran Sasso LUNA facility with very low background noise. Results show no discrepancy in the two methods, leading towards an extrapolated S(0) value of 0.56+\/-0.017 keV barn. Furthermore, branching ratios between the two prompt gamma-transitions have been measured with precision. The results of this determination will prove invaluable for accurately predicting solar neutrino fluxes."}
{"text":"\nThe goal of this study was to develop a classification system and estimate intrinsic astrophysical parameters of unresolved galaxies, in order to be prepared for Gaia's scanning law obtaining low resolution optical (330-1000 nm) spectrophotometry of several million galaxies brighter than V=22. A library of synthetic galaxy spectra was created using the PEGASE.2 code, based on galaxy evolution models which take metallicity evolution, extinction correction, and emission lines into account with stellar spectra from the BaSeL library. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) were utilized as the classification and regression models. Results showed that a basic library of ~4000 zero redshift galaxy spectra covering the main Hubble types could be produced and a extended library was generated by reproducing this system of spectra at a series of redshifts. Initial results of the SVM classifiers and parametrizers proved encouraging, indicating Hubble Types could be predicted and parameters estimated with low prediction bias and variance. Comparison of colours of the synthetic library to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) spectra showed good agreement over the full range of Hubble types and parameters."}
{"text":"\nIn this article, we describe a linear muffin-tin orbital basis-set used to implement the dynamical mean-field theory approach for investigating the electronic properties of materials with strong correlation. This implementation features full self-consistency over the charge-density, taking into account correlation-induced changes to the total charge density and effective Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian. It provides a method for computing the total energy, with a proper treatment of the high-frequency tails of the Green's function and self-energy. We use the Hubbard-I approximation to the dynamical mean-field self-energy, applied to both insulating cerium sesquioxide Ce2O3 and the gamma-phase of metallic cerium, to exemplify the importance of self-consistency over the charge density for determining thermodynamic and spectral properties, especially in the case of the oxide material."}
{"text":"\nThis article presents a method for calculating the optical and screening properties of semiconductor nanocrystals using a tight-binding approach. This approach enables the inclusion of local field effects due to the confinement of nanocrystals. Applications to absorption, polarizability and screening functions of InAs and Si nanocrystals show good agreement with first-principles and experimental results. In addition, this method permits examination of the continuum dielectric model commonly employed to account for nanocrystal surface polarization. The differences between this model, which uses a size-dependent dielectric constant, and the approach of this article, which considers local polarization fields, are discussed. Our calculations suggest that the continuum dielectric model underestimates the nanocrystal polarizability, leading to notably strong surface polarization fields."}
{"text":"\nWe consider the coalescence of initial protoplanet systems composed of equal-mass bodies with equal spacing in a gas-free environment as well as in a protoplanetary disk. We investigate the time it takes for orbits to cross (T_c) in each case and find an empirical expression for EMS systems in the absence of a disk background: log(T_c\/yr) = A+B log(k_0\/2.3). Through an analytical approach, we reveal an increase in the eccentricity of these protoplanets on average over time, and show that their eccentricities can be approximated by a Rayleigh-distribution. The power law dependence of T_c on the planetary separation is also demonstrated. We further evaluate the mass of the embryos, which influence the formation of gas giants, based on the dust and gas surface densities."}
{"text":"\nStarting from the assumption that any time interval can be related to the age of the Universe, we explore the implications for the speed of light, energy conservation, and the uncertainty principle, using the constants of Planck as a consistent parameter throughout the theory. We show that the Schr\u00f6dinger equation predicts a sinusoidal, non-localised solution for the future of the Universe, wherein energy decreases linearly over time. While the speed of light may vary, the relativistic absolute interval stays constant, and a 'Mass-Boom' effect is observed. Thus, we can reach an ultimate conclusion concerning the fate of the Universe that is based in the principles of quantum mechanics."}

This new exactly solvable model is then employed to study the collective spectra and $B(E2)$ transition probabilities of odd-mass nuclei, such as $^{157}Gd$, $^{173}Yb$ and $^{163}Dy$, from the rare earth region.

{"text":"\nWe have completed a detailed analysis of the galaxanic cluster Cl 0024+17 at redshift 0.4, combining both strong- and weak-lensing measurements to construct a high-precision mass map.

This structure is likely the result of the collision of two clusters approximately 1-2 Gyrs ago, as indicated by the velocity distribution of the cluster. Our numerical simulations confirm that this structure can be generated without the presence of any inter-cluster baryonic material. Additionally, we have also reconciled the discrepancy between the cluster's X-ray and lensing mass measurements. Our results suggest that the cluster's X-ray profile can be explained by the superposition of two separate X-ray systems.

{"text":"\nThis study examines the impacts of various aerosol processes on simulated inorganic PM2.5 during two high-pollution episodes over Greater Tokyo: 9 and 10 December 1999 and 31 July and 1 August 2001. The aerosol impacts are derived from simulations of the chemistry-transport model, Polair3D, where different options are tested in the aerosol module, including heterogeneous reactions. Results showed that condensation and coagulation, along with long-range transport, had the greatest impact on sulfate in the winter episode, while long-range transport proved the most dominant factor in the summer episode. For the inorganic PM2.5 components, condensation\/evaporation had a major impact in both episodes. Heterogeneous reactions had major effects on nitrate and ammonium but their thermodynamic equilibrium assumption had a more modest impact. Deposition was found to have small but not unimportant consequences for all inorganic PM2.5 components, relative to other processes. Nucleation and coagulation were also observed to have variable, but largely small, effects."}
{"text":"We investigate two different structures of superconducting-ferromagnetic (S\/F) materials. The first type is a Josephson junction, which includes two S\/F double layers held together by an insulator. It is discovered that when the magnetization of the two layers is arranged in an antiparallel manner, the Josephson critical current $I_c$ increases with the amplification of the exchange field $h$. The second structure is composed of a S\/F material that contains an inhomogenous magnetization within the ferromagnetic layer adjacent to the S\/F interface. Through the proximity effect, a singlet element as well as a triplet element of the superconducting condensate is formed in the ferromagnetic bundle. The triplet part is capable of travelling over a distance of $\\sqrt{D\/\\epsilon}$ (where $D$ is the diffusion coefficient and $\\epsilon$ the energy). This longer range tendency leads to a substantial rise in the ferromagnetic conductivity below the superconducting critical temperature $T_c$. Contrasting the single component, the contribution to the conductance by the triplet element does not decrease to zero at $T = 0$ and $V = 0$ (where $V$ is the voltage), and instead decreases in a monotone fashion as the temperature rises."}
{"text":"\nIn this article, we report on the observation of electron-hole puddles in graphene using a scanning single electron transistor. It has been theoretically suggested that, when the average carrier density is zero in graphene, disorder will lead to the formation of electron and hole puddles with equal probability. We conduct experiments to measure the carrier density landscape of graphene near the neutrality point. Our results unambiguously show the formation of electron-hole puddles, verifying the theoretical predictions. Furthermore, our technique also enables us to measure the local density of states in graphene. Our research suggests that exchange and correlation effects are either negligible or balance each other out. Moreover, the kinetic contribution to the density of states is consistent with the measured values."}

This set of vector bundles has been previously shown to be related to the construction of certain sextic nodal surfaces in $\\PP^3$. We explore this relation further and prove there is an open subset of these bundles, with minimal cohomology, that is irreducible and bimeromorphic to an open set $\\fA^0$ of the G.I.T. space of type $(3,3,4)$ triple tensors by the action of $SL(W)\\times SL(U)$.

{"text":"\nIn this paper, we present an off-shell supersymmetric description for some supersymmetric field-theories where traditional superfield formalism is not effective. This new formalism involves introducing auxiliary variables in addition to the conventional odd super-coordinates, which is similar to the pure spinor formalism developed by N. Berkovits. We show that this formalism can be used to analyse a Chern-Simons-like (Wittens OSFT-like) theory and prove that it is an off-shell version of some on-shell supersymmetric field theories. We utilize the simplest non-trivial model found in [2] to exemplify the potential of this pure spinor superfield formalism, followed by repeating all the calculations for the 10-dimensional Super-Yang-Mills theory. In this latter case, deriving an off-shell description is more difficult and an additional Z_2 projection is also required. We discover a non-trivial Z_2 duality in the Feynman diagrams, but the nature of this duality needs further studying."}

Moreover, we apply an energy principle to develop stability principles for magnetic fields in more general media with magnetic free energy that depend on both density and magnetic induction, such as type II superconductors. From this, we derive the growth rate and instability conditions for an instability originally discussed by P. Muzikar, C. J. Pethick and P. H.

{"text":"\nHigh resolution spectroscopic observations of two B-type post-Asymptotic Giant Branch (post-AGB) stars in globular clusters, Barnard 29 in M 13 and ROA 5701 in omega Cen have been made in both the optical and ultraviolet wavelengths.

Both stars had abundances which were lower than those of young B-type stars, thus in agreement with the metallicity of the two respective clusters. However, the Fe abundances derived from the HST spectra were lower than expected from the clusters' metallicities, by 0.5 dex for Barnard 29 and 0.8 dex for ROA 5701. This same systematic underabundance was also found among other B-type stars, suggesting that the Fe III ultraviolet lines may be yielding values which are too low by circa 0.6 dex and thus must be treated with caution."}
{"text":"By analyzing a $SO(d)$ gauge theory in a Euclidean $d$-dimensional space-time, we provide a mechanism that breaks the $SO(d)$ color invariance and generates an effective metric tensor - allowing for an interpretation of the model as a modified gravity.

{"text":"\nThis paper investigates all solutions of N=2 supersymmetric IIB supergravity that possess non-zero five-form flux. It is found that the remaining Killing spinors give rise to stability subgroups of $Spin(7)\\ltimes\\bR^8$, $SU(4)\\ltimes\\bR^8$ and $G_2$. For the $SU(4)\\ltimes\\bR^8$ case, two different types of geometries are identified depending on the properties of the Killing spinors, respectively being generic and pure. Both solutions admit a null Killing vector field, and the twist of this vector is trivial for the generic case and non-trivial for the pure case. For the pure case, the complex structure involved is integrable and corresponds to a relatively balanced Hermitian structure. Furthermore, for the $G_2$ solution, a time-like Killing vector field and two spacelike closed one-forms are discovered, with an associated co-symplectic $G_2$ structure. For the $Spin(7)\\ltimes\\bR^8$ solution, this is found to give rise to a pp-wave propagating within an eight-dimensional holonomy $Spin(7)$ manifold. Additionally, this paper shows the lifting of all supersymmetric solutions of the five-dimensional supergravity, with a time-like Killing vector field included, to the $SU(4)\\ltimes\\bR^8$ pure Killing spinor IIB backgrounds.

We check that the fermionic and bosonic masses are equal and Ward identities are satisfied. In two dimensions, we introduce a modified Wilson term leading to discretization errors of order O(a^2). Our studies show that the masses gotten from the corresponding supersymmetric model approach their continuum values faster than those from a model with the standard Wilson term. We also observe a comparable increase in performance when employing the SLAC derivative."}
{"text":"\n\nUsing Chandra X-ray stacking techniques, we evaluated the contribution of 24 micron-selected, X-ray-undetected sources to the unidentified Cosmic X-ray Background (CXB) in the hard (6-8 keV) X-ray band. The source catalog used was from the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS) - North and South fields. We observed a substantial X-ray signal from these X-ray-undetected mid-infrared sources at all energy levels, including for the first time a significant 6-8 keV signal. We determined that the sources consisting of bright mid-infrared sources compose about 2% of the total CXB below 6 keV, and approximate 6% in the 6-8 keV band. The results of our study suggest that the sources are indeed obscured AGNs, but are not a primary source of the unresolved 50% of 6-8 keV CXB. Our analysis indicates that this remaining unidentified CXB likely arises from a large population of obscured, z > 1, Seyfert-luminosity AGNs."}

{"text":"\nThis research investigates the use of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models in order to calculate the reaction of a structural system that has been exposed to ground motion data from earthquakes in India. The system was first trained with a single recorded earthquake, and then used to simulate lower intensity earthquakes. The results of the response predictions made by the ANN model matched what was observed in practical terms. Furthermore, if the ANN was trained only with a part of the ground motion data it was able to accurately predict the reaction of the system efficiently.\n\nThe paper also tested the ANN trained on the period and maximum response observed from the building after an earthquake and used it to predict maximum response in different scenarios. When this model was tested using ground motion data from a different location it had not been trained for, it was found to match at a satisfactory rate. This could enable us to be proactive and predict the safety of any structure before an earthquake occurs."}
{"text":"\nThe investigation of the properties of SmMn2Si2-xGex compounds has revealed the effects of substituting Ge for Si. The Sm ordering temperature was determined to be much greater in the compound with x=2 compared to the ones with x=0 and 1. This heightened temperature is credited to the increase in Mn-Mn distance between layers. It was observed that the compound with x=2 exhibited re-entrant ferromagnetism at low temperatures. Magnetic contributions to heat capacity were detected in all three compounds; the ground state multiplet was estimated by evaluating the Schottky formula for the magnetic part of heat capacity data. The isothermal magnetic entropy change remained the same for x=0 and 1; however, there was a decrease in this value in the compound with x=2 even though the nature of the magnetic transition transited from second order to first order as x increased from 0-2. Resistance was observed to increase with increasing Ge concentration; additionally, the excess resistivity in the antiferromagnetic area was calculated."}
{"text":"\nWe present a new numerical model for exploring the connection between black hole growth and AGN feedback with cosmological structure formation simulations. Our model considers seed black holes at early times, allowing us to investigate their evolution from gas accretion and mergers. We distinguish between two forms of feedback depending on the black hole accretion rate: In quasar mode, a fraction of their bolometric luminosity is thermally coupled to the environment; at low accretion rates, mechanical feedback is adopted, where AGN-driven bubbles are injected into the atmosphere. By using our model, we carry out cosmological simulations ranging from galaxies to galaxy clusters, both in isolated and cosmological contexts, and find results consistent with observational constraints. The impact of the black holes on their hosts is also investigated, promoting changes in star formation history, gas content, and colours. Lastly, clusters with more massive black holes register shallower metallicity and entropy profiles and reduced cooling."}
{"text":"In this paper, we explore the behavior of the Josephson vortex lattice in layered\nsuperconductors under the influence of high-frequency c-axis electric field. Through\nnumerical methods, we determined the frequency-dependent loss function at varied\nmagnetic fields.

{"text":"\nUsing Spitzer observations, a circular 24 micron shadow with a 70 arcsec radius was found in dark globule CB190 (L771). The maximum extinction of this shadow was roughly 32 visual magnitudes at its center. Molecular data of 12CO and 13CO J = 2-1 over a 10 arcmin X 10 arcmin region around the shadow showed a temperature of ~10 K. It is believed that CB190 is located 400 pc away based on the spectroscopic parallax of a star linked to the globule. A Bonnor-Ebert analysis of the density profile in conjunction with this distance determined xi_max to be 7.2, indicating that CB190 may be unstable. The thermal pressure indicates a temperature of 56 K, which does not align with CO and thermal continuum temperature readings. Thus, the thermal pressure alone is not enough to hold the cloud in a steady state. Additionally, the turbulence present in the cloud is insufficient to support it, but the magnetic field could provide the necessary support. However, this field would eventually be leaked out through ambipolar diffusion. Therefore, it is likely that CB190 is either in a late pre-collapse stage or already collapsing."}
{"text":"\nWe present the results from using the a 42-48 GHz spectrometer on the Green Bank Telescope to observe the NVII hyperfine spin-flip transition with a rest frequency of 53.042 GHz in an effort to search for million degree gas in astrophysical environments. This transition can be observed for redshifts larger than 0.1, when shifted into a suitable transparent radio band. We observed 3C273, 3C 279, 3C 345, and 4C+39.25 for absorption studies, as well as Abell 1835, Abell 2390 and PKS 1345+12 in emission line studies, with no evidence seen above the 5 sigma confidence level. Analysis of the strongest emission and absorption features, seen in Abell 2390 (3.7 sigma) and 4C+39.25 (3.8 sigma) respectively, lead to the conclusion that these features are unlikely to be real. With longer observations, NVII absorption line studies may become a valuable tool in the search for hot intergalactic gas."}
{"text":"\nThis article offers a novel approach to securely share random bits over the Internet without needing to use third parties as well as factoring numbers into primes. The scheme starts with a shared sequence of length K_0 and then, with the use of a fast optical random source, generates needed random bits and noise for creating a sequence K >> K_0. This is done in order to enable thorough encryption for each message transmitted - users have absolute control of the security. The transmission of the random signals and physical noise are in the form of recorded signals which are immune from any deduction or addition from an outside attacker. This process is further examined and has also been proven to be secure against known-plaintext attack. The information-theoretic analysis provides quantitative bounds for secure operation of the system."}
{"text":"\nThis paper presents a hydrodynamic model for the inner regions of a thin accretion disk around a black hole, aimed at exploring the impact of viscous torque and dissipation on spin estimation. We take into account an alpha-viscosity prescription, as well as height-integrated hydrodynamic equations, and a pseudo-Newtonian potential. We find that compared to the standard Shakura & Sunyaev disk model, the results of the hydrodynamic models are substantially altered when the values of H\/R and alpha increase. Furthermore, our results suggest that spin estimation through the fitting of continuum spectra is only reliable when the thickness of a disk is smaller than 0.1, and the value of alpha is lower than 0.2. Moreover, we found that in our hydrodynamic models, the contrast in density and thickness between the gas situated in the disk, and inside the ISCO is small for disks with H\/R >0.1, implying that the estimation of black hole spin through the analysis of relativistically-broadened X-ray line profiles of fluorescent iron emission may be most successful for extra thin disks. These findings must be confirmed later with MHD simulations of radiatively cooled thin disks."}
{"text":"\nThis article examines the Wightman function, vacuum expectation values, and energy-momentum tensor of a Z_{2}-symmetric brane that has a finite thickness and resides in an (D+1)-dimensional AdS background. These values are analyzed in the general case of plane symmetric interiors and are split into two parts; the AdS-induced part and the brane-induced part. Furthermore, models are considered in which the interior structure is a slice of Minkowski space. As a result, it is observed that internal vacuum forces acting on the edges of the brane tend to decrease its thickness, both for minimally and conformally coupled scalar fields."}
{"text":"This article examines how a peak color trend of old, metal-rich globular clusters (MRGCs) corresponds to the mass of the host spheroids \u2013 typically early-type galaxies and spheroidal subsystems of spiral galaxies. A direct estimate of the ages of the MRGC populations can neither rule out nor confirm an age trend. However, various indications suggest that the more massive the spheroid, the older the MRGC population. We evaluate the role of a possible age trend of the MRGC population in explaining the peak color trend, and show that it can account for up to approximately 50%. The other 50% of the trend may be attributed to systematic variations in alpha-element ratios (with a range of Delta[alpha\/Fe] of 0.1 - 0.2), interfering with the effectiveness of a systematic variation in [Fe\/H] ratios (with a range of Delta[Fe\/H] of 0.1 or even none)."}
{"text":"\nUsing the data collected by the FOCUS high energy photoproduction experiment at Fermilab, we have conducted a Dalitz plot analysis of the Cabibbo favored decay D+ to K-pi+ pi+. This analysis counts 53653 Dalitz-plot events with a ~97% signal fraction, and is the most complete and highest statistics Dalitz plot analysis conducted thus far for this channel. The results are described using two different formalisms; the first utilizes Breit--Wigner functions for each component and freely fitted mass and widths, which is the method customarily utilized, and serves as a benchmark for comparisons with other published analyses. The second is formulated with a K-matrix approach for the dominant S-wave component, where parameters are determined first by fitting Kpi scattering data and then traced to threshold using Chiral Perturbation Theory. Our results are in agreement with the hypothesis that the final state interactions are dominated by two body processes, and are consistent with the description of these interactions based on other Kpi data."}
{"text":" In this article, we explored the feasibility of a dark matter candidate, the neutralino, through the gauge mediation derived from the emergence of supersymmetry. This approach dictated that the gravitino was incredibly massive and therefore decoupled the low energy theory. The soft masses are primarily derived from gauge mediation, and not other means, creating an interesting hybrid of features including a nearly gauge-mediated spectrum with a large mSUGRA-like bino-stau coannihilation channel, and also with a possible A-resonance-like annihilation near large $\\tan \\beta$. We constrained our parameter space using WMAP dark matter relic density data, LEP2 Higgs mass bound, and a number of collider and exotic B-meson decay bounds."}
{"text":"This paper explores two slave-particle theories of the tt't''J model in regard to how the quasiparticle current and low-temperature superfluid density vary with doping. It is found that in the slave-boson theory, the renormalization factor $\\alpha$ which corresponds to nodal properties weakly correlates with doping, while the doped-carrier theory develops an isotropy in the momentum space which increases $\\alpha$, bringing it in close agreement with experiment. In addition, this paper proposes an experimental signature specifically for local staggered spin correlations which can distinguish the doped-carrier theory from other corresponding theories of high-Tc superconductors."}

{"text":"This paper investigates the quantization problem on Grassmann manifolds with dimensions n and p. Novelty is provided by deriving a closed-form formula for the volume of a metric ball in Grassmann manifolds when the radius is small. This formula works for any n and p, whereas previous results only applied to either p=1 or fixed p in proportion to large n. The Gilbert-Varshamov and Hamming bounds for sphere packings are obtained based on this formula. Furthermore, there are tight lower and upper bounds established on the distortion rate tradeoff, supposing a uniformly distributed source and a distortion measured by squared chordal distance. The results were backed up by simulated data. Additionally, the paper gives a better understanding of the information rate of a Multiple-Input Multiple-Output system, provided there is finite-rate channel-state feedback. This possesses better accuracy than previous works, limited to either Multiple-Input Single-Output models or those with a huge number of transmit antennas and a fixed number of receive antennas."}
{"text":"\nThis work evaluates the information throughput of a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication system with a finite-rate channel state feedback and power-on\/off technique. When this power-on\/off system is engaged, a fixed amount of power is allocated to an available beamforming vector, or the beam is 'turned off'. It is found that, when both the transmitter and receiver have a large number of antennas and there is perfect beamforming, the ratio of optimal 'on-beam' components and given antennas remains constant for every given signal-to-noise ratio. To further perfect this system, a near optimal strategy with a fixed number of 'on-beam' components is discussed. Additionally, a formula to compute the maximum achievable power efficiency is suggested based on the feedback rate. To verify the accuracy of this system, simulations are carried out for various signal-to-noise ratios. The results of these simulations demonstrate that the approximates used for this system are precise for all offered signal-to-noise ratios."}
{"text":"This article explores the best number of user connections in multi-antenna broadcast networks. Using advanced analysis techniques, this study discovers that the optimal number of users to have 'on' (user connections enabled) is a dependent upon the signal-to-noise ratio, system size, and various other settings. A feasible strategy is determined to decide how many users should be connected as the antennas and feedback rate approach a large quantity. With this methodology, the research aims to realize a higher spatial efficiency, achievable by selecting the proper user connections. Additionally, the analysis is deemed valid for systems which have variances in path loss coefficients and feedback rates. The results of the study display a considerable increase in performance when compared to situations with a fixed number of user connections."}
{"text":"\nThis paper explores the constraints from precision data on the 11 chiral coefficients ($\\al_i, i=0, ..., 10$) of the electroweak chiral Lagrangian in the context of effective field theory. Using the Feynman-'t Hooft gauge in the modified minimal subtraction scheme, we obtained the one-loop renormalization group equations and the corresponding improved renormalization group equations, which were used to sum over the logarithmic corrections. Moreover, we examine the effects of the chiral coefficients on the experimental uncertainties of the oblique correction parameters $S(\\Lambda)$ and $T(\\Lambda)$. Particularly, we show that the current experimental data still allows for a parameter space of positive $S(\\Lambda)$ with $\\Lambda > 1$ TeV, and that in the presence of operators that contribute to the triple and quartic gauge-boson couplings, $T(\\Lambda)$ has a tendency to increase with $\\Lambda$."}
{"text":"This paper studies the quantization of points on a Grassmann manifold when the quantization code has a different dimension than the source. We present a closed-form expression that gives the volume of such a metric ball as the radius approaches 0. This expression holds for all cases of Grassmann manifolds and allows us to derive bounds for the rate distortion tradeoff. Additionally, we show that random codes are asymptotically optimal with respect to achieving minimum achievable distortion as the code rate grows linearly with the dimension size when compared to the source. Lastly, this paper provides some applications in communication theory such as capacity calculation of additive white Gaussian noise and characterizing the effect of beamforming matrix selection in multi-antenna communications."}
{"text":"\nIn many three-dimensional systems of interacting spins, static long-range order develops as the temperature is lowered. However, if the spins are quantum, novel quantum paramagnetic states can emerge. The most sought-after of these is the resonating valence bond (RVB) state, with its entanglement of spin singlets. In this paper, we present evidence for the presence of such a state in the two-dimensional kagome latices ZnxCu4-x(OD)6Cl2, where the S=1\/2 magnetic Cu2+ moments form planes. In Cu4(OD)6Cl2, the heavily distorted kagome layers show a dispersionless excitation mode below around 20 K that resembles a valence bond solid (VBS), which breaks rotational symmetry. Doping with nonmagnetic Zn2+ reduces the distortion and lowers the magnetic occupancy, leading to the suppression of the VBS state. In ZnCu3(OD)6Cl2, with its undistorted kagome planes and 90% occupancy, the low energy spin fluctuations of the spin liquid phase are largely featureless."}
{"text":"\nThis paper presents an improved numerical and physical approach for carrying out spatio-temporal studies of unstable accretion disks that revolve around black holes. It translates a combination of the standard pseudo-spectral method and the adaptive domain decomposition method existing in literature into a special treatment for connections of decomposed subdomains and the mapping between the Chebyshev-Gauss-Lobatto collocation points and the physical collocation points within each subdomain. This advanced method is verified by reproducing the results of the prior work of Szuszkiewicz and Miller on the limit-cycle behavior of thermally unstable accretion disks with moderate viscosity. It is further highlighted that this type of disk exhibits a negative Bernoulli function, thus hindering the possibility of outflows arising from these disks. Hence, this method is encouraged to be applied to evaluate the heavily viscous thermally unstable accretion disks as well, which will consequently be reported in the forthcoming paper."}
{"text":"\nThis article investigates the relationship between the determinant function of two variables and the weighted complexity, as well as the Bartholdi zeta function, of graphs. The results show that the weighted complexity of a graph can be extracted from the partial derivative of the determinant function evaluated at a certain point, along with the derivation of a new formula for the Bartholdi zeta function. In addition, a similar approach is employed to find a formula for a different weighted complexity, wherein the weights of spanning trees are the sum of the weights of edges, and the weighted complexities are then calculated for the product of complete graphs as an example."}

{"text":"\nSpectroscopic multi-epochs have been conducted on evolved stars in the intermediate-age open cluster, NGC 1883, in order to definitively decipher the cluster's membership, radial velocity and metallicity. This is to settle claims by Tadross (2005) of NGC 1883 having a metal abundance comparable to that of the globular clusters of the Milky Way halo. This study is additionally significant due to NGC 1883 being one of the few outer disk intermediate-age open clusters known, which could help us to improve our understanding of the radial metallic abundance gradient of the Galactic disk. The outcomes of this investigation include pinpointing NGC 1883's mean metallicity at [Fe\/H] = -0.20 \u00b1 0.22, with an age similar to the Hyades and a Galactocentric distance of 12.3 \u00b1 0.4 kpc. This undertakes confirms that in the outer Galactic disk, there is a shallower abundance gradient as compared to that of the solar neighborhood."}
{"text":" By analyzing millimetre wavelengths around 1 mm, the solar chromosphere can be evaluated. Future high-resolution millimetre arrays, such as the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), can help further improve the understanding of the thermal structure and dynamics of this layer. The data produced by these arrays is used to calculate synthetic brightness temperature maps on the basis of three-dimensional radiation (magneto-)hydrodynamic (MHD) simulations. Different wavelengths go through different parts of the photosphere and chromosphere, with longer wavelengths mapping the low and middle chromosphere. Variations in the electron density and optical depth caused by deviations from ionisation equilibrium have an effect on the range of the formation height and the average brightness temperature. Comparing the brightness temperature distributions across different wavelengths and disk positions provides valuable insight into the temperature fluctuations in these atmospheric layers."}
{"text":"\nThis paper investigates the utilization of multi-layer perceptrons (MLP), radial basis functions (RBF) and support vector machines (SVM) for the development of a bushing condition monitoring framework. It proposes two tiers, with the first level to determine if the bushing has a fault, and the second one for type identification. Dissolve gas analysis is employed for diagnostic purposes. MLP classifier attained best accuracy results and quicker training time than the other two types. Additionally, an adaptive and on-line condition monitoring approach is presented and tested; this approach incorporates incremental learning via the employment of MLP. As data was added, accuracy improved from 67.5% to 95.8%, and the same result was observed when newly encountered conditions came into the equation: accuracy improved from 60% to 95.3%. Conclusively, the presented approach's confidence value on its decisions stood at 0.92 on average."}
{"text":" This article examines a shift away from the traditional, one-dimensional solution of fluid dynamics equations. While originally all velocity vectors functioning in the equations would depend solely on the time t and Cartesian coordinate x, this article explores the possibility of also considering trajectories of fluid motions in various directions. The functions will now depend not only on t and x, but also on an angle that is determined by all coordinates. As a result, the motion of a fluid will no longer be so straightforward and can be envisioned as different trajectories placed under different angles in 3D space, which are restricted by a finite relation with functional arbitrariness. This more versatile solution will enable analysis of nonlinear processes and singularities in substances such as plasma, gas, and liquid when they are in a state of infinite conductivity."}
{"text":"\nIn this paper, we explore how the mass loss from C-rich AGB stars depends on their evolutionary stage. We consider the mass loss evolution during He-shell flashes and the subsequent long-term dynamical evolution of the circumstellar envelope. Our analysis uses detailed frequency-dependent radiation-hydrodynamical models for the flash event and circumstellar envelope, which include dust formation. We discover that existing simple formulae for mass loss do not match the findings of our models. Next, we are calculating a grid of wind models to observe how mass loss depends on the stellar parameters. Early results show that it is not possible to make simple parameterisations due to the irregularity of the wind mechanism in certain regions of parameter space. Ultimately, our goal is to improve stellar evolution models, in particular the TP-AGB phase, with an improved description of mass loss."}
{"text":"\nIn this article, we examine the generalization capability of a learner composed of non-linear perceptrons, including a 'true teacher', ensemble teachers, and student. Utilizing the framework of on-line learning, statistical mechanics are used to numerically and analytically identify the student's generalization error. We investigate two major learning rules, Hebbian learning and Perceptron learning, and distinguish them as having fundamentally different behavior from the study of linear models. Applying Hebbian learning, solutions can be obtained analytically, with the generalization error steadily diminishing until it reaches a predetermined steady value that does not vary with changes to the learning rate. The accuracy of the model is found to be inversely proportional to the number of teachers, but increases with the variety of the ensemble teachers. For Perceptron learning, numerical solutions must be obtained, and the results of the model display dynamic non-monotonic behavior. Here, modifying the learning rate will have an inverse effect on the minimum value of the generalization error, but is determined instead by the number of teachers, and the variety of the ensemble teachers."}
{"text":"\nThis study reveals new insights into the evolutionary processes involved in the depletion and correlation of beryllium and lithium in stars. By analyzing high-resolution VLT\/UVES spectra of members from three open clusters NGC 2516, the Hyades and M67, we investigate different temperature ranges and ages in order to better understand the beryllium and lithium abundances in stars. In particular, we observe a beryllium-lithium correlation in stars hotter than 6150 K, while stars whose temperatures lie within this range lack evidence of beryllium depletion. Our results suggest that rotation may be the dominant driving force of the mixing processes for stars hotter than 6150 K, but not for solar-type stars. Furthermore, the beryllium content of two blue stragglers are observed to be markedly different, indicating a difference in the formation processes of each. Overall, our study provides further evidence of the mixing processes at work in stars and the formation of blue stragglers."}
{"text":"The findings from the HESS telescope have prompted an investigation into the potential source of gamma rays originating from the Galactic Centre. In this paper, we explore the potential for diffusion of cosmic ray protons from multiple supernova remnants situated in the SgrA* region, plus a contribution from SNR in the rest of the Galactic Centre Region contributing to a galactic centre ridge. In the region, protons are favored over electrons due to the presence of magnetically induced attenuation of the electrons. In order to explain the observed gamma rays, anomalous diffusion of protons and a low efficiency of acceleration of SNR in high density regions were postulated. Additionally, a close correlation of gamma rays with 5 GHZ radio radiation is observed which is related to the presence of the SNR in the GCR."}
{"text":"\nThis paper offers a subtraction scheme for a Yang-Mills theory realized utilizing a nonlinear representation of the SU(2) gauge group. We apply dimensional regularization for the manipulation of the associated poles in D-4. The unphysical Goldstone bosons, the Faddeev-Popov ghosts, and the unphysical mode of the gauge field are anticipated to be eliminated through the unitarity equation. The spontaneous symmetry breaking parameter is not a physical variable. We employ the tools already verified through the nonlinear sigma model: the hierarchy involving the number of Goldstone boson legs and a weak power-counting property (finite number of independent divergent amplitudes at every order). The inherent symmetry of the model proves to be SU(2)_L local times SU(2)_R global. The physical amplitudes are dependent on the mass, the self-coupling constant of the gauge particle, and the scale parameter of the radiative corrections. The implementation of the calculation is done in the Landau gauge."}
{"text":"\nThe Anderson-Yuval-Hamann representation is used to study the nonequilibrium two-level system, composed of a localized electronic level coupled to two electronic reservoirs and a fluctuating two-state system. This is achieved by mapping the system onto a plasma of alternating positive and negative charges arranged along two Keldysh contours to describe nonequilibrium dynamics. The interaction between these charges depends on the relative time separation compared with (i) a dephasing scale defined by the chemical potential difference of the electronic reservoirs and (ii) a decoherence scale defined by the current flowing between the reservoirs. A renormalization group is employed to include the effects of decoherence which affects the reactivation of independent resonances associated with the two chemical potentials and leads to a classical long-time behaviour. Finally, the effects of deviations from equilibrium on the phase transition of localization-delocalization are calculated."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate the feasibility of continuous quantum error correction for preserving qubits from decoherence caused by a general Hamiltonian interaction with an independent bath. We first consider the effects when the trivial single-qubit code is used, and discover the difference between Markovian and non-Markovian decoherence. Our further exploration involves the use of a bit-flip code, where qubits are coupled to independent bath qubits and subjected to continuous correction. It is found that if a high enough error-correction rate is achieved, the encoded state will evolve in a manner similar to that of only one decohering qubit, but with a reduced coupling constant. Notably, the extent of decrease of the coupling constant is proportional to the square of the error-correction rate, while it is only proportional to the rate in the case of Markovian noise. The different scalings of the two occur due to the Zeno regime present in the Hamiltonian evolution that is not present in purely Markovian dynamics. We then explore the range of validity of our result and identify two contributing time scales. Lastly, we generalize our findings to more complex codes and conclude that the performance of continuous error correction will possess qualitatively similar features."}
{"text":"This study examines the non-linear functional equation P(z)=Q(y(z)) when P(z) and Q(y) are both polynomials of degree k>=1 and y(z) is limited to being analytic near z=0. We offer conditions that ensure that all the roots of Q(y) are found within the range of y(z) as well as when y(z)=z is the one analytic resolution to the non-linear equation. Our findings were inspired by the unique polynomial canonical representations associated with oscillatory integrals existing in the asymptotic assessment of the coefficients of multivariable generating functions and mixed powers. The one-complex variables results we present have Levinson's polynomial canonical representations of analytic functions in multiple variables as a consequence. These results will be valuable when designing algorithms to calculate the Taylor coefficients of the terms featured in these particular representations."}

It is established that the tensionless limit is consistent with quantization in a pp-wave background. It is further demonstrated that a bi-Hermitian target space provides an equivalent generalised K\u00e4hler structure in the sigma model.Moreover, T-duality is shown to be a symplectomorphism in the Hamiltonian formulation of the sigma model, and in special cases, the N=(2,2) extended supersymmetry is preserved. Lastly, a first-order formulation of the sigma model reveals a geometrical framework containing generalized complex geometry."}
{"text":"\nThe study of charge ordering with accompanying lattice distortion in quasi two dimensional organic conductors \\theta-(ET)2X (ET=BEDT-TTF) is explored. An extended Hubbard model with electron lattice couplings of a Peierls-type is used in combination with the Hartree-Fock approximation. The results show that the horizontal-stripe charge-ordered state, which is observed experientally in \\theta-(ET)2RbZn(SCN)4, is stabilized with the self-consistently determined lattice distortion. Additionally, anisotropy in nearest-neighbour Coulomb interactions, Vij, favours the horizontal charge order over diagonal, vertical and 3-fold-type states. Finite temperature free energy comparison between metallic and insulating states that have various charge orders finds a first-order transition from a 3-fold charge ordered metallic state to an insulating state with a horizontal charge order. The paper examines the role of lattice degrees of freedom for the realization of the horizontal charge order in comparison to experiments within \\theta-(ET)2X."}

{"text":"\nThis article examines the use of the continuous time random walk (CTRW) approach and its extensions in the Markovian representation (MR) and the non-Markovian stochastic Liouville equation (SLE). This representation allows the probability distribution function (PDF) of fluctuation renewals to be linked with the reoccurrences of a certain jump state in the controlling process of a Markovian system. The article also explores the effect of CTRW-like noise on the relaxation of dynamic and stochastic systems, as well as modifications of the CTRW approach. These include the cascade of CTRWs and processes governed by fluctuating PDFs. It is shown that the W(t) of the controlling process can significantly affect the kinetics of the system, with the possible results of this effect being discussed."}

After introducing the concept of infinitesimal control to develop the underlying kinematical principles, these principles are used to classify extremals of variational problems and create a kinematical algorithm assigning a corresponding abnormality index to each admissible curve. This is then applied to further analysis of constrained variational calculus, re-examining Pontryagin's maximum principle, Erdmann-Weierstrass corner conditions, the Lagrange multiplier method, and developing a free Hamiltonian system for Pontryagin's equations. Finally, a sufficient condition for the existence of finite deformations with fixed endpoints is laid out and proved."}

We obtain a general exact solution for the mixture of vacuum fluid and dustlike matter and use it to evaluate a numerical model. This shows how the cosmological T-models can fulfill the observational constraints."}
{"text":"\nUsing Chandra X-ray observations, we have identified X-ray emission from a 50-kyr-old pulsar, PSR J1809-1917, and its related pulsar wind nebula (PWN). The pulsar's spectrum follows a PL+BB model, with a photon index of 1.2, BB temperature of 2 MK, and hydrogen column density of 0.7x10^22 cm^2. Its 0.5-8 keV luminosity is estimated to be around 4x10^31 ergs\/s, while its bolometric BB luminosity is around 1x10^32 ergs\/s at a plausible distance of 3.5 kpc. The PWN appears in an north-south elongated shape which is consistent with ram pressure confinement due to the supersonic motion of the pulsar. Fitting a PL model to the PWN spectrum gives a photon index of 1.4 and 0.5-8 keV luminosity of 4x10^32 ergs\/s. There also appears to be large-scale (~4') X-ray emission in the same direction as the motion of the pulsar, which could be due to either strong intrinsic anisotropy of the PW or a relic PWN swept by the asymmetrical reverse SNR shock. PSR J1809-1917 and its PWN are associated with the unidentified TeV source, HESS J1809-193. Interestingly, the discovered X-ray source CXOU J180940.7-192544 could alternatively be the source of the relativistic electrons powering HESS J1809-193."}
{"text":"\nWe explore the late-time optical and near-infrared light curves of SN 2001el and their contribution from 310 to 445 days post the peak brightness. The UBVRI bands are found to have an even, linear decay with time constants of 1.43\\pm0.14, 1.43\\pm0.06, 1.48\\pm0.06, 1.45\\pm0.07, and 1.03\\pm0.07 magnitudes (each hundred days), respectively. Meanwhile, the JHKs bands display a more nearly-constant rate in the same period, with 0.19\\pm0.10 and 0.17\\pm0.11 magnitudes (each hundred days) in J and H, respectively. Compiling the ultraviolet, optical, infrared (UVOIR) luminosity has a decay time that closely coincides with the kinetic energy of positrons. It is seen, therefore, that a significant amount of energy resides in the near-infrared components of the light curve, which was previously observed in the peculiar SN 2000cx and not restricted to it. The UVOIR output is a sign of the positrons being trapped within the ejecta, conflicting with predictions of a weak and\/or radially oriented magnetic field configuration."}
{"text":"This article explores the relationship between tidal influences, star formation and the onset\/fueling of active galactic nuclei (AGN) by examining the case of I Zw 1, a quasar with an adjacent spiral hosting galaxy and the small nearby companion to the west. Through high-resolution NIR images and optical to near-infrared color composites, it is revealed that there could very likely be signs of merger-induced star formation activity in the western part of the I Zw 1 host galaxy. Spectroscopic data is used to confirm companion galaxy's old evolved stellar population and also a new separate source to the west. The northern source is reconfirmed as a late-type foreground star. Lastly, lines of the I Zw 1 nucleus K-band spectrum are discussed and line fluxes are provided."}
{"text":"\n\nThis paper introduces ENSTAR, a large acceptance scintillator detector, which has been developed to detect the decay particles resulting from the formation and decay of $\\eta$-mesic nuclei, namely protons and pions. ENSTAR consists of 122 plastic scintillator pieces of various shapes and sizes arranged in a cylindrical geometry, resulting in an almost complete coverage ($\\sim$95%) of the full 4$\\pi$ solid angle. Based on simulation predictions, it is suggested that the decay particles emitted from the $\\eta$-mesic nuclei will have energies of 25 to 300 MeV for protons and 225 to 450 MeV for pions, with an angular opening of 150$^\\circ \\pm 20^\\circ$. Simulations show that the detector will detect approximately 80% of these particles, and multiple test measurements have been carried out to study the detector's response. In-beam tests with a proton beam of 870 MeV\/c from COSY have also been conducted, which demonstrate that the scintillator fibre design performs adequately. This work provides an overview of ENSTAR's design, simulations, construction and test results."}
{"text":"\nThis article develops and investigates a generalised version of the Einstein\ncondition for parabolic geometries.

{"text":"The emerging development of optical microresonators presents an extensive range of potential applications from quantum electro-dynamics to optical telecommunications. Now, researchers have successfully implemented electro-optically tunable microring resonators on submicrometric thin films of lithium niobate. This implementation was made possible with an improved crystal ion slicing and bonding technique that utilized benzocyclobutene. With a radius of 100 micrometers, the microring resonators can be tuned using the electro-optic effect, suggesting that lithium niobate can be used in chip-scale integrated optical devices and nonlinear optical microcavities. As such, it potentially offers more innovative functionality and a greater degree of control over traditional devices."}
{"text":"\nThis paper strives to more firmly establish the foundations of Quantum Field Theory (QFT) as first proposed by Heisenberg and Pauli in 1929. The goal is to examine the potential of nonlinear generalized functions to properly interpret the canonical quantization of fields that has constituted the dominant understanding of QFT for the last century. It is proposed that such functions can provide an adequate mathematical setting for the original calculations, thus resolving lingering technical issues such as how to construct suitable domains for the interacting field operators and calculate matrix elements from the unitarity of the S operator. Additionally, the use of nonlinear generalized functions in QFT could potentially yield a viable connection to renormalization theory and offers a straightforward approach with no significant prerequisite knowledge in either mathematics or physics. To support these assertions, the authors present the case study of a self-interacting scalar boson field, providing a foundation for future improvement in the field."}
{"text":"\nIn this article, we compute the decreased genus 1 Gromov-Witten invariants of Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces, which confirm the 1993 Bershadsky-Cecotti Ooguri-Vafa prediction for the standard genus 1 GW-invariants of a quintic threefold. Using a combination of constructions drawn from past works and the classic localization theorem, reduced genus 1 invariants for CY-hypersurfaces are related to previously calculated integrals on moduli spaces of stable genus 0 maps into projective space. These complicated expressions, when applied to a genus 1 equivariant generating function, can be simplified significantly due to a property of a genus 0 equivariant generating function. At last, disregarding terms that are unable to affect the non-equivariant part of the former, we relate the answer to a specific hypergeometric series as simplistic representation. This approach described in this article works on a systematic level, directly applicable to more cases of computing reduced genus 1 GW-invariants and to higher-genus localization computations."}
{"text":"This paper examines the relationship between stellar reaction rates and laboratory cross sections for photon-induced reactions, as well as the conditions necessary for these reactions to occur, in order to improve our understanding of nucleosynthesis. It is found that a type of synchrotron radiation available at SPring-8 that recreates a stellar blackbody radiation at intense temperatures may yield sufficient event rates of (gamma,alpha) and (gamma,p) reactions in the p-process path. These experiments would offer the potential to refine nuclear parameters in statistical models and reduce the uncertainties of nucleosynthesis calculations."}

Necessary conditions on the two-point correlation function S2(r) are set out, and a conjecture is formulated. Realizable two-point correlation functions and analytical basis functions are provided and a construction algorithm, the Lattice-Point algorithm, is devised to generate materials from two-point correlation functions based on the Yeong-Torquato technique. This technique can be used to categorize and analyze these materials in terms of their macroscopic properties."}
{"text":"This paper presents a novel approach to reduce the complexity of the Sphere Decoding (SD) maximum likelihood (ML) detection algorithm which is typically applied to Square Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) systems. The proposed lattice representation makes it possible to independently decode the real and imaginary parts of each symbol, obtaining substantial complexity reductions compared to traditional SD in terms of floating point operations per second (FLOPS) and the number of nodes visited throughout the algorithm tree search. Simulation results transform this into an overall complexity reduction of 80% for a 2x2 system and almost 50% for larger 4x4 and 6x6 systems. This will correspondingly reduce the hardware requirements for implementation."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate the relativite entropy of quantum states, proving the substate theorem - that if the relative entropy of two quantum states, rho and sigma, is c, then there is a state rho' close to rho such that ||rho' - rho||_t <= epsilon, and rho'\/2^{O(c\/epsilon^2)} is a substate of sigma. We apply this to derive a privacy trade-off for the set membership problem in the two-party quantum communication model. Namely, Bob needs to reveal at least n\/2^{O(k)} bits of information about his input to obtain k bits of information from Alice. Additionally, we discuss the relationships between various information theoretic quantities relating to the substat theorem."}
{"text":"\nWe present an investigation of the mass assembly of stars observed over the last 10 billion years utilizing a vast 3.6-$\\mu$m selected sample. After dividing our sample into active (blue) and passive (red) galaxies, our measurements of K-LFs and LD evolution support the notion that a large proportion of galaxies had already assembled by $z \\sim 1.2$. Utilizing the stellar mass-to-light proportion (in K-band) of our spectroscopic subsample, the total stellar mass of the sample is calculated. Results demonstrate that the global development of this mass is mostly comparable to the star formation rate concluded from UV dust corrected measurements. In addition, the active population exhibits a consistent stellar mass density over the 8 billion year observation period, whilst the quiescent population steadily increases. These outcomes suggest that the growth of the stellar mass in the passive population is a result of the halting of star formation in active galaxies that have shifted to the inactive population. From $z=2$ to $z=1.2$, there is a strong build-up in the quiescent population, with an observed increase by a factor of 10, implying that this epoch had an elevated number of galaxies concluding their star formation activity and forming the red sequence."}
{"text":"\nThis article examines the alterations to the accretion disk of the dwarf nova V2051 Oph over two separate outbursts. Employing eclipse mapping analysis on\nlight curves from a normal (July 2000) and a low-amplitude (August 2002) outburst, we create maps of the disk surface brightness evolution and trace the motion of heating and cooling waves. Our determinations illustrate that the outward-moving heating wave moved at a rate of ~1.6 km\/s, while the inward-cooling wave was much slower, and accelerates as it proceeds towards the middle of the disk. Results imply the outburst of V2051 Oph is activated by augmentations to the mass from the mass donor star, as the disk brightness temperatures remain lower than expected according to the disk instability model."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate the consequences of the absence of Z_2 symmetry on a brane world in a variable number of dimensions. We obtain an effective Einstein equation on the brane by considering the junction conditions of the brane and the relationship between the mean extrinsic curvature of the brane and the bulk curvature from the Gauss equation. The new equation reflects the presence of an anisotropic fluid on the brane which has no Z_2 symmetry. This equation is useful for studying brane worlds with compactified dimensions on the brane and for providing a regularization for a higher codimension brane world, where the Kaluza-Klein compactification acts as regularization for the singularities associated with higher codimension branes."}
{"text":"This article explores the two possibilities for modeling data distribution by a mixture of Gaussians, which are: i) classical mixture model with Dirichlet prior and ii) discrete valued hidden variable. It illustrates how Dirichlet accounts for the proportions in data sets that sum up to one, and how the Potts distribution is more suitable for datasets representing images for which the hidden variables constitute a segmentation. This paper  further investigates the different algorithms used for simulation and parameter estimation for each of the two models."}
{"text":"\nWe explore how energy is distributed in the vortical and wave modes of a 3D rotating stratified fluid given different values of Burger numbers characterized by $\\epsilon = f\/N = Bu^{-1\/2}$. Our investigation reveals a transformation of the interactions between the wave and vortical modes relative to the reference state of $Bu = 1$ depending on whether $\\epsilon < 1$ or $\\epsilon > 1$. When $\\epsilon < 1$, the wave mode energy saturates quickly and follows a steepening of $k^{-1}$ to $k^{-5\/3}$ scaling for wave modes between the forcing and dissipation scales, $k_f$ and $k_d$, respectively. On the other hand, if $\\epsilon > 1$, wave mode energy dominates and never saturates. Our results suggest that 3D quasigeostrophy is evident when $\\epsilon \\le 1$; the vortical mode energy follows a $k^{-3}$ scaling and amplifies with wave modes up to the forcing scale. For $\\epsilon > 1$, the vortical mode composes a smaller portion of the total energy and the 3D quasigeostrophic subsystem plays a diminished role in the overall dynamics."}
{"text":"\nIn this paper two examples of magnetic anti-dynamos in magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) are presented. The first example is a 3D metric conformally related to Arnold cat fast dynamo metric: ${ds_{A}}^{2}=e^{-{\\lambda}z}dp^{2}+e^{{\\lambda}z}dq^{2}+dz^{2}$, which shows that the magnetic field decays exponentially with time. The Riemann curvature components, $R_{pzpz}$, $R_{qzqz}$ and $R_{pqpq}$ are observed to also undergo change; while the first component decreases, the second component steadily increases, while the third component remains constant. The other anti-dynamo discussed is a thin magnetic flux rope or twisted magnetic thin flux tube, which also exponentially decays with time. This example is based on the Riemannian metric of the magnetic twisted flux tube with an axis that possesses Frenet curvature and torsion. Since the torsion of this rope's axis is close to zero, it satisfies the Zeldovich theorem which states that planar dynamos can not exist. It is believed that by affecting the topology of this example, a real dynamo could be produced."}
{"text":"\nWe analyze the GRB 031203 afterglow using a theoretical framework that interprets the GRB structure as a combination of a proper GRB, released when an electron-positron plasma reaches its critical point, and an \"immediate emission\" due to external shocks. In addition to this, the GRB 031203 is noted to generate a prolonged soft X-Ray emission lasting up to 10^7 seconds, and looks to decay exponentially. Named by us URCA-3, researchers are attempting to ascertain whether this additional energy source is linked to the GRB or to the accompanying supernova (SN) 2003lw. If the latter is found to be true, then the energy source could either be from the SN ejecta's interaction with the interstellar medium or from the cooling of an emergent neutron star, formed in the SN 2003lw event. Comparisons and contrasts between the GRB 031203\/ SN 2003lw\/ URCA-3 triptych and other analogous GRB\/ SN\/URCA associations have been discussed."}
{"text":"\nThe mid-infrared spectra taken by the InfraRed Spectrograph (IRS) aboard the Spitzer Space Telescope during secondary eclipse of two transiting planets, HD 209458b and HD 189733b, were featureless. While the spectra did not display the absorption expected from water vapor shortward of 10 \u03bcm, one-dimensional models of HD 189733b generated spectra showing absorption from water vapor. Spitzer's InfraRed Array Camera (IRAC) 8 \u03bcm photometry for HD 189733b, in addition to previously published secondary eclipse photometry for this planet, aligns with the model-generated spectra. As for HD 209458b, the model spectra are an adequate fit to the data, indicating that the water abundance does not need to be adjusted or cloud opacity taken into account. The agreement between model spectra and IRS spectra of brown dwarfs with similar temperatures to these highly irradiated planets confirms the accuracy of the modeling procedure."}
{"text":"\nThis article discusses the application of a hierarchical Markovian model for the fusion of spectral classification, segmentation, and data reduction in the analysis of hyperspectral images. The proposed Bayesian estimation approach employs a hidden Markovian variable to enable the joint estimation of the desired independent components, with the common segmentation variable facilitating both data reduction and segmentation. Experiments conducted to compare the proposed method to the established techniques of the field demonstrate its effectiveness in reducing the dimensionality of hyperspectral images, in spectral classification, and in the segmentation of such images."}
{"text":"\nThis article examines a system of one-dimensional Brownian motions (BMs) where the particles shall never collide. This system is realized as (i) Dyson's BM model, which is a diffusion process of hermitian matrix-valued eigenvalues in the Gaussian unitary ensemble (GUE). It is also realized as (ii) the $h$-transform of absorbing BM, wherein the harmonic function $h$ is a product of differences of variables as given by the Vandermonde determinant. The Karlin-McGregor formula provides a determinantal expression for the transition probability density of an absorbing BM. Through the Karlin-McGregor formula, this article investigates how, should the initial state be in the eigenvalue distribution of GUE, the noncolliding BM is then a determinantal process. In particular, it is shown that any multitime correlation function is related to a determinant specified by a matrix-kernel. By taking appropriate scaling limits, spatially homogeneous and inhomogeneous infinite determinantal processes are found. Further, it is noted that the determinantal processes related to noncolliding particle systems have a common feature; their matrix-kernels are expressed via spectral projections of effective Hamiltonians. Finally, a continuity of processes in time is established through the common structure of matrix-kernels, thereby discussing general properties of the determinantal processes."}
{"text":"\nThis article seeks to uncover how and why fifty years of unsuccessful attempts to uncover dark matter has resulted in a large emphasis on pursuits of dark matter and dark energy in astronomy. I argue that much of this is due to suppressing the evidence that contradicts $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology, and using tactics such as questionable citation to further ensure the dominance of the model. With that being said, there remains a significant portion of evidence which does not support the model, and two competing models in particular very closely compete with $\\Lambda$CDM. The conclusion drawn is that astronomy can only return to a healthier state if the overwhelming preference of funding towards $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology is instead put towards investigating other models."}
{"text":"\nThis paper analyzes the scaling relations of compressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence. We observe a general agreement between our findings and the Fleck (1996) model of compressible hydrodynamic turbulence. We determine that the density-weighted velocity, $u\\equiv\\rho^{1\/3}v$, follows the Kolmogorov scaling of $E_u(k)\\sim k^{-5\/3}$ for large Mach numbers. In addition, the exponents of the third-order structure functions for $u$ remain constant, no matter the Mach number. The scaling of latter order correlations follows the She-Leveque (1994) scalings of two-dimensional dissipative structures, with an invariant scaling with changing Mach numbers. The structure is similar in each direction parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field, unlike the scaling behavior of $v$. The peaks in density form a hierarchy in which both physical and column densities decrease in scale according to Fleck's predictions. This hierarchy is present in the ubiquitous small ionized and neutral structures (SINS) in interstellar gas, and suggests that research on the statistics of column density peaks can offer an improved understanding of turbulent velocity studies, and supersonic turbulence in the absence of velocity information."}

{"text":" The Nonperiodic Anyon Model is examined to explain the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect (FQHE) in terms of LLL-anyonic wave functions. Taking into account the finite size of flux tubes, the model establishes an inverse proportional relation between the critical filling factor and the parameter of statistical exchange. When the fluxes are anti-parallel to the external magnetic field and critical filling is achieved, the external magnetic field is completely shielded by the mean magnetic field associated with the flux tubes. Utilizing the clustering argument, values for the statistical parameter can be chosen to ensure the fillings match those proposed by Jain's series, as well as new FQHE series like the particle-hole complementary to the Laughlin one. This same clustering argument can be used to produce particular fractional filling series in fast-rotating Bose-Einstein condensates."}
{"text":"\nThis article presents an algorithm for the recursive calculation of effective resistances in distance-regular networks, which takes into account the Bose-Mesner algebra, stratification of the network, spectral techniques and the Christoffel-Darboux identity. It is argued that the resistance distance between two nodes on the network is an strictly increasing function of the shortest path distance. Furthermore, a connection between the resistance distance and random walks is explored, linking the average commute time and its square root to the effective resistance. Results of the algorithm are also given for several important examples of finite distance-regular networks."}
{"text":"\nWe explore a general formalism of Gaudin models associated to affine Kac--Moody algebras to quantize classical soliton integrable systems, such as the KdV hierarchy. Through our experience with Gaudin models associated to finite-dimensional simple Lie algebras, we can deduce that the common eigenvalues of quantum Hamiltonians should be described by affine opers associated to the Langlands dual affine algebra. This provides us with several concrete predictions concerning the spectra of quantum Hamiltonians of soliton systems. One example is the KdV system, where affine opers may be expressed as Schroedinger operators with spectral parameters, which are in perfect agreement with those recently suggested by Bazhanov, Lukyanov, and Zamolodchikov. Therefore, this example and other recent correspondences between quantum integrals of motion and differential operators may be seen as special cases of the Langlands duality."}
{"text":"\nIn this study, we evaluate the behavior of a layered associative network of Leaky Integrate-and-Fire Neurons that have learned memory patterns using Hebbian Learning. We analyze their activity utilizing Fokker-Planck methods and in doing so, we reveal how a synfire chain can coexist within a single network. We find that when a network is sparsely connected (memory pattern rate $F<0.5$), synchronous firings promoting the memory pattern are promoted, whereas in a densely connected network ($F>0.5$) such firings are inhibited. Additionally, the sparseness and denseness of the network affects the basin of attraction and the storage capacity of the embedded memory patterns, with sparsely connected networks demonstrating an enlarged basin of attraction and increased storage capacity."}
{"text":"In this article, the angular velocity of a particle in a stable, circular orbit in a vacuum on the brane is investigated. It is found that the four dimensional effective Einstein equation in the brane world scenario receives additional terms, referred to as dark radiation and dark pressure, which come from the embedding of a 3-brane in the bulk. Examining the rotational velocities of test particles gravitating around galaxies, it can be deduced that the velocity tends toward a constant value as a function of distance from the galactic center. By taking into account the constant tangential velocity, the general solution for the gravitational field equations on the brane can be determined analytically. This provides the explicit form of the Weyl tensor's projection on the brane and the equation of state of dark pressure relating to dark radiation. Relevant physical and geometric amounts are related to observable\/measurable factors, such as the tangential velocity, baryonic mass, and the radius of the galaxy. The qualitative analysis of motion of test particles is also executed by proposing a simple linear equation of state for the dark pressure, which then offers insight into the prediction of brane world models made observable at the extra-galactic scale."}
{"text":"This research project sought to determine the spatial features of shared patent applications in Japan. The analysis revealed that the degree of a firm in the patent network has a power law distribution. Additionally, the colleagues of a firm typically have no correlation in their average degree, but the clustering coefficient for these firms has a negative correlation. The distance of the links indicated an accumulation of firms by region, as well as potentially, the value of the time taken for physical travel between the nodes. Lastly, the ratio of internal links between cities point to the importance of considering any existing links firms may have in helping form new links."}
{"text":"\nThe CoRoT mission has selected exoplanet-host star HD 52265 as its main target for a continual observation over the course of 5 months. This period of study provides a valuable opportunity to further our knowledge of planets around such stars. Our analysis of the data has shown that models based on HD 52265's metallicity, gravity, effective temperature and luminosity from astronomical observations can take several forms. As such, these models vary in external and internal parameters and have an effect on the properties of the stellar oscillation frequencies. We have also provided evidence of how a helium-rich core can cause the ``small separations'' between the frequencies to be negative. We hope that the data collected through the CoRoT mission will help discriminate between the different models presented."}
{"text":"\nThis article investigates the emergence of odd-frequency pairing states generated within normal metal\/superconductor (N\/S) junctions. Utilizing the quasiclassical Green's function formalism, we illustrate the ways in which translational invariance breakdown near the N\/S interface allows for the generation of odd-frequency pair amplitudes. With an even-parity pairing potential (i.e. traditional spin-singlet s-wave states) in the superconductor, an odd-parity odd-frequency component will be induced at the interface. In the event of an odd-parity potential (including spin-triplet $p_{x}$-wave or spin-singlet $d_{xy}$-wave states), the odd-frequency component created has an even-parity character. Additionally, in conventional s-wave junctions, the amplitude of the odd-frequency pairing state is intensified at energy values corresponding to local density of states peaks. Furthermore, in $p_x$- and $d_{xy}$-wave junctions, the odd-frequency component at the superconductor side of the interface is bolstered at zero-energy, with midgap Andreev resonant state (MARS). Ultimately, this odd-frequency pairing extends across the N region, and surpasses the even-frequency pairing at the LDOS peak-energies, incorporating the MARS."}
{"text":" Through analyses of the data gathered from the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) instrument on the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), this study has determined vertical and horizontal velocities in 123 pairs of moving magnetic features (MMFs) in three active regions \u2013 NOAA ARs 8375, 0330 and 9575 \u2013 that are in accordance with the U-loop model. This model posits that the downflow is caused by the Evershed flow that descends below the solar surface. The study also suggests that the change in MMF flow speed is due to characteristics of the MMF pairs themselves, as opposed to being related to the radial structure of the moat flow. Lastly, it was found that the lifetimes of MMF pairs are affected by the age of the parent sunspot, with ARs 9575 and 0330 having lifetimes of 0.7 hours and 1.6 hours respectively."}
{"text":"\nThis article provides an overview of the theory of longitudinal atomic beam spin echo experiments and demonstrates the use of a master formula to calculate the position- and time-dependent amplitude function of atomic wave packets. Additionally, a tutorial for the Fahrplan model, which allows for visualisation of the propagation of different atomic eigenstates, is presented. To illustrate the application of our theoretical findings, we study the presence of parity violating geometric (Berry-)phases in atoms, which are revealed through the computation of geometric flux densities. An example with a specific field configuration is presented to confirm the existence of such a phase."}
{"text":"\nThis paper examines data from lidar observations of midlatitude cirrus clouds and multiple tropopauses gathered from the SIRTA observatory from 2002-2006. The temporal properties of the tropopauses (frequency, thickness) are detailed, as well as the correlation between tropopause frequency and cirrus clouds. Results show that the frequency of MT increases from May to December, and so does the average tropopause thickness. Further, more than 7% of cirrus clouds were observed to be positioned between the two tropopauses, exhibiting mostly low optical depths. It is suggested that multiple tropopauses could affect the distribution of cirrus clouds."}
{"text":"\nWe present a methodology to construct high-accuracy, effective, and faithful waveforms of the gravitation wave signal emitted by binary black-hole (BBH) mergers. Our focus is on small-mass-ratio non-spinning systems, which can be explored effectively using Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli methods. Our methodology based on the Effective-One-Body (EOB) framework uses a comprehensive approach to understand the physical properties of each component of the waveforms and systematically compares analytic EOB-based waveforms with corresponding exact waveforms from numerical relativity. Our results include an improved, 3PN-accurate description of inspiral waveforms, a refined analytic expression for the plunge waveform, and a better treatment of the matching between the plunge and ring-down waveforms. Our methodology allows us to construct complete analytic waveforms that prove to be in excellent agreement with the exact ones in terms of modulus, frequency, and phase, staying in-phase, on the whole, under $\\pm 1.1 %$ of a cycle. We believe that this procedure can be extended to comparable-mass cases making it useful to ground-based gravitational wave detectors."}
{"text":"\nOur analysis of a volume-limited sample of 3184 galaxies culled from the Millennium Galaxy Catalogue has shown that the relationship between asymmetry and proximity of pairs is strongly linked to estimating galaxy merger rates. We found that around 35% of pairs with a projected separation of less than 20 h^{-1} kpc and a velocity difference of less than 500 km s^{-1} possess significant asymmetry which suggests a strong likelihood of being physically bound. Additionally, we determined that 80% of asymmetric galaxies have either merged or are participating in an interaction. However, sources of contamination, such as stars near the source extraction or fragmentation of the algorithm, have to be taken into consideration. The merger fraction determined by both close pair method and asymmetry is about 2% for a merger rate of (5.2 +- 1.0) 10^{-4} h^3 Mpc^{-3} Gyr^{-1}, the latter being consistent with theoretical simulations while implying a stable evolution with redshift ending at z = 1."}

Based on these properties, algorithms for both classical and quantum graph isomorphism are proposed, to improve the accuracy of identifying isomorphism classes of large datasets, such as strongly regular graphs. This new development is a potential breakthrough for an efficient resolution of the graph isomorphism problem, which can be further pursued in the form of similar quantum walks or other related techniques for other practical purposes."}
{"text":"\nThis article explores the signatures of a heavy Z-prime in the extra U(1) superstring inspired model, by means of an analysis of renormalization group equations (RGEs) pertaining to the anomaly free E-{\\6}-Eta model of rank 5. We observe that this Z-prime is of TeV order at a minimum, and weak Z-Zprime mixing angle is required for reasonable value of its mass. This requires the large singlet VEV, and is ensured by the non-universality of Yukawa couplings at GUT scale, in accordance to the unitarity constraints both at GUT and weak scale. The gauge couplings unification, along with universal tri-linear couplings, gaugino masses, and soft supersymmetric breaking masses at GUT scale is another factor contributing to the symmetry breaking. The large angle of Yukawa couplings (order of 1) provides an effective-Mu parameter at the electroweak scale and can achieve the desired low energy spectrum."}
{"text":"\nThis article reviews the problem of dark energy and its implications for the nature of gravity, with the cosmological constant as the leading candidate. We first explore the concordance cosmology, and review the evidence for dark energy as well as the theoretical and observational arguments in favor of the cosmological constant. We then outline some possible approaches towards understanding the nature of the cosmological constant and extracting the key ingredients that must be incorporated in a viable solution. Finally, we discuss an alternative perspective on gravity in which the action is efficiently invariant under the shift of the matter lagrangian. This leads to a background equation. Evaluating this equation leads to Einstein's theory at the lowest order, with Lanczos-Lovelock type corrections."}
{"text":"\nWe conducted a study using \\emph{Chandra}'s high resolution X-ray gratings to analyze the soft X-rays from 15 type I AGNs. 10 of the AGNs revealed that they contain intrinsic ionized absorbers with varying column densities of $10^{20-23} \\rm{cm}^{-2}$. A majority of these absorbers had photoionization with speeds in the range of $10^{1-3}$ km $\\rm{s}^{-1}$, some of which had multiple ionization components, and three with multiple kinematic components. These warm absorbers with $\\xi < 10$ ergs cm $\\rm{s}^{-1}$ showed unresolved Fe transitions. The mass outflow rate resulting from these absorbers were found to be higher than the expected accretion rate, as long as the filling factor was equal to 1, or even 1%. However, the velocities of the outflows seemed to have a gap, between $300-500$ km $\\rm{s}^{-1}$, and lower column densities for absorbers with velocities lower than the gap."}
{"text":"\nThe interest within the past few years in specific heat $C$ of insulators and semiconductors has grown due to the availability of samples with differing isotopic masses and the capacity to carry out \\textit{ab initio} assessments of the temperature dependence $C(T)$ with the basis of electronic band structure. The bulk of the crystals explored are elemental (germanium) or binary (gallium nitride) semiconductors, with the earlier electronic calculators operated in the local-density approximation and neglecting spin-orbit interaction. Agreement between the experimental evaluations and calculated estimates was normally satisfactory, with the exception of crystals with heavy atoms(PbS), which had discrepancies of 20% at the low temperature peak obtained from $C\/T^3$. This divergence is thought to originate from neglecting spin-orbit interaction, which is paramount for heavy atoms such as the $p$ valence electrons of lead. Here, we look into measurements and \\textit{ab initio} computations for bismuth (with $\\Delta_0\\sim$1.7eV), essentially a semimetal but in the temperature region accessible to us (T > 2K) acting in the same way as a semiconductor. We augment literature data on the issue, and state that \\textit{ab initio} calculations are just 20% lower than the actual measurement when spin-orbit interaction would not be taken into consideration. Encompassing spin-orbit interaction decreases the disparity remarkably, making the maximum of $C(T)$ only 7% greater than the recorded one. Perfect agreement springed if the spin-orbit hamiltonian was dropped by a factor of $\\sim$0.8."}
{"text":"\nThis study examines the polarization position angle of 4290 flat-spectrum radio sources with polarized flux density greater than or equal to 1 mJy to test the hypothesis of systemic alignment of polarization angle vectors on large scales, as proposed by Hutsemekers et al. (2005). Splitting the sources into high-redshift (z >= 1.24) and low-redshift sub-samples, and looking at sources in the areas identified by Hutsemekers et al. has not produced any evidence of large-scale alignments. Furthermore, correlation between polarization position angle and those of parsec-scale jets derived from VLBI also showed no systematic alignments, suggesting that jets and their polarizations maintain an irrelevant relationship. The results of this search for aligned radio polarizations suggest that the systemic alignment hypothesis proposed by Hutsemekers et al. is baseless."}
{"text":"This article presents the results of an experimental study of the network topology of a Futures Exchange. Using a web server set up to simulate exchanging futures contracts coupled to event outcomes, participants were allowed to register and compete for money prizes upon maturity of the contracts. The interactions between market participants were measured and the cash flow networks was reconstructed from the transactions. The results show that the topology of the network is hierarchical, disassortative, and scale-free, exhibiting a power law exponent of 1.02+-0.09 in the degree distribution. The study also found that the small-world property emerged early in the experiment while the number of participants was still small and there are power law distributions of the net incomes, inter-transaction time intervals, and the distribution of community sizes, which were found to have an exponent of 1.19+-0.16. Furthermore, the study was able to conclusively link the characteristics of high degree, high betweenness centrality, low clustering coefficient, and low degree-correlation with big winners and losers in the exchange."}
{"text":"\nThis paper investigates the evolution of structures generated by the dissipativeless collapse of N-point sources with various levels of resolution. We identify a need for at least 100,000 particles to achieve convergence in terms of the axial aspect ratio, along with an upper bound for the softening of 1\/256. Moreover, we explore the effects on oblateness of scaling cold initial mass distributions, ro ~ r^-g, with values from 0 to 2. Our findings reveal that more peaked initial structures (high g) generate more oblate equilibria, and when g is between 3\/2 and 2, the mass profile follows a power law of index ~g out to a mass fraction ~10 per cent. In addition, we observe that the inner velocity coarse-grained DF is of a Maxewllian form."}
{"text":"\nThe most recent data on charmless strange $B^+ \\to VP$ decays, now including $B^+\\to \\rho^+ K^o$, appears to confirm a simple penguin model in which the gluon $G$ in an initial $\\bar s u G$ state splits equally into $u \\bar u$, $d \\bar d$ and $s \\bar s$, and all associated form factors are the same. Further investigation has revealed only a few clear signals not diluted by experimental errors, and implications of these have been discussed. The experimental result $0.25 \\pm 0.11$ for the ratio of branching ratios $BR(B^+ \\to K^{*+}\\eta)$ to $BR(B^+\\to K^{*+}\\eta')$ confirms the parity selection rule's prediction of 0.32. Additionally, there are notable violations in a novel sum rule, analogous to the pseudoscalar sum rule incorporating $K^+\\eta$ and $K^+\\eta'$. It is uncertain whether the cause of these is due to electroweak penguin effects, or from additional mixtures of intrinsic charm in the $\\eta-\\eta'$ system. An alternative approach informed by symmetry offers further predictions to be tested through experimentation. This model describes the splitting of $\\bar s u G$ into two mesons as a strong interaction S-matrix, governed by nonexotic hadron resonances present in multiparticle intermediate states."}
{"text":"\nThis article explores the notion that introducing hidden variables can still abide by the statistical predictions of quantum theory. This is shown by two pivotal experiments with correlated photons, where their behavior is deemed 'violently non-classical'. The conclusion reached is similar to Einstein's persuasion - that the expression of a system's state is not a sufficient explanation of its physical state. The experiment of quantum teleportation is then briefly looked into, and it is concluded that a classical approach can be a complete understanding of the outcome, where no teleportation has occurred. Attention is also drawn to the potential of overlooking the differences between quantum mechanics for massive particles, and the behavior of photons. Classical electrodynamics is looked to as the answer, and this requires a link between the two ideas without any speculative ideas."}
{"text":"\nThis paper details the varied and changing properties of the outer X-ray lobe-jets and radio jets of R Aqr over a time period of 1999.8 to 2004.0. Observations by the Chandra and VLA reveal a probable shock from the collision between high velocity material and regions of denser gas in the Northeast outer X-ray lobe-jet, moving outward at ~580 km s^-1. The Southwest outer X-ray lobe-jet appeared to have dissipated over this time span. The radio emissions showed a smaller outward motion than the X-ray. Additionally, density, mass, cooling times, and shock speeds of the X-ray material were evaluated. Implications of pressure and confinement are further explored."}
{"text":"The present article focuses on unbounded regular operators acting on Hilbert $C^*$-modules over arbitrary $C^*$-algebras.

The range of $P_FP_{G(t)^\\bot}$ is dense in its biorthogonal complement if and only if $t$ is regular. Additionally, this study shows that a densely defined $\\mathcal A$-linear closed operator $t$ between Hilbert $C^*$-modules is regular if and only if $\\mathcal A$ is a $C^*$-algebra of compact operators.

{"text":"\nBy utilizing the moderated version of Newton's Law of Attraction, with an assumption wherein a flux of gravitons pass through matter, a term describing the attenuation of gravity was observed. This permitted a comparison between the relativistic orbital elements of planets and the observed mass distribution of the Sun. Therein, the findings created an interactions cross section of 3.2x10^-17 m2\/kg (nearly 10^-40 cm2\/ nucleon) and produced a diminutive variation of gravity during a solar eclipse; estimated at 0.13 microgals. Subsequent analysis elucidated the ways in which this minor adjustments could impact the geoid - evidenced by anticipated deformation of the visage of gravity at around ten millimetres. Moreover, the results of measurements taken in the district encompassing Montreal during the Sun eclipse of May 10, 1994, displayed an anomaly of 2.4 microgals that corroborated exactly with the duration of the eclipse. This serves to corroborate the applicability and success of the corpuscular theory postulated."}
{"text":"\nWe recently performed simulations of the boundary layer between a white dwarf and an accretion disk utilizing a 2.5D time-dependent axisymmetric numerical code. The code uses the full compressible Navier-Stokes equations, including an alpha-viscosity prescription, to produce a representation of these systems in the absence of radiation. In the energy equation, either the dissipation function (Phi) is considered or the energy is assumed to be quickly emitted away. Varying levels of alpha viscosity, signifying distinct mass accretion rates, was examined in the simulations. A rapidly rotating, non-magnetic accreting white dwarf led to an accretion disk stretched all the way to the stellar surface and then distributed towards the poles. High viscosity cases (alpha=0.1) created a boundary layer that was optically thick and had extended more than 30 degrees to each side of the disk plane after three quarters of a Keplerian rotation duration. On the other hand, low viscosity cases (alpha=0.001) resulted in an optically thin boundary layer, free of gravity waves. "}
{"text":"\nAn examination of 137 quasar spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey reveals no clear evidence of large voids in the Lyman alpha forest due to highly ionized hot super-bubbles formed during the development of galaxy clusters. Utilizing a physical model for the HII bubble growth during cosmological reionization, we can determine that models wherein the volume of hot bubbles is greater than 20% at a redshift of 3 can be erased as a possibility, as such scenarios would result in a disproportionately high number of large voids when compared to the standard model for the Lyman alpha forest. These results suggest an alternate option when it comes to pre-heating of galaxy clusters, potentially implying that feedback processes must occur relatively recently (z<3) or limit entropy deposition to higher density regions."}
{"text":"\nIn order to gain insight into the ratio of cosmic-ray to thermal gas pressures within the intracluster medium (ICM) of galaxy clusters, we explore the potential of the Gamma-ray Large Area Space Telescope (GLAST) and imaging atmospheric Cerenkov telescopes (IACTs). GLAST could provide upper limits of only a few percent for nearby rich clusters and, for more distant (z<0.25) clusters, tight constraints of <10% could be made in the case of a hard spectrum by stacking. IACTs could also be used to gain a more precise constraint on the cosmic-ray spectrum. Ultimately, these gamma-ray observations could be used to study the energetics of cosmic-rays, which would have major implications for cosmological tests."}
{"text":"We have conducted two experiments to measure microwave radiation from energetic particle shower plasmas. In 2003, at the Argonne Wakefield Accelerator lab, our measurements indicated the possibility of microwave emission from air ionized by high energy electrons and photons. A follow-up experiment at SLAC (Stanford Linear Accelerator Center) in summer 2004 provided additional support for these observations. To further assess the potential of this method to detect UHECR air showers, we have built a prototype detector, and have made measurements indicating a potential detection of cosmic rays. Compared to nitrogen fluorescence technology, this method would provide all-weather, 24-hour duty cycle access to UHECR measurements, with moderate precipitation being possible. Further experiments are currently underway to confirm these promising initial results."}
{"text":"\nThe electrical resistivity in systems such as heavy-fermion compounds and high-temperature copper oxide superconductors is observed to exhibit linear behaviour that can indicate the presence of a zero-temperature instability or quantum critical point. In order to further explore this phenomenon in CeCoIn5, a system wherein this linear behaviour is visible, systematic chemical substitutions of both magnetic and non-magnetic rare-earth ions into the Ce sub-lattice were conducted. Results showed that inelastic scattering in Ce1-xRxCoIn5 is largely dependent on the f-electron configuration of the R ion, rather than the Kondo-lattice coherence or Cooper-pair breaking. This leads to the conclusion that the anomalous scattering rate and linear resistivity found in CeCoIn5 are due to the incoherent scattering centers present in its Kondo lattice. "}

{"text":"We have studied the physical and spectral characteristics of three late T-type dwarfs, HD 3651B, 2MASS J09393548-2448279, and 2MASS J11145133-2618235. By comparing these sources to the well-known T8, 2MASS J04151954-0935066, we were able to determine the effective temperatures, gravities, and metallicities of a T7.5 and two T8 dwarfs. We found that the T7.5, HD 3651B, had Teff=820-830K, log g=5.4-5.5, and [m\/H]=+0.2, with an age of 8-12 Gyr and an implied mass of 60-70 M_Jup. The two T8s and 2MASS J04151954-0935066 had similar effective temperatures, but lower metallicities of [m\/H]=-0.3. We derived ages and implied masses of ~10 Gyr and 60 M_Jup for 2MASS J09393548-2448279, and ~5 Gyr and 40 M_Jup for 2MASS J11145133-261823. Our results indicate that the inclusion of laboratory NH3 opacities may be useful in distinguishing between the very late type classes. However, there are currently still major uncertainties, as the abundance of NH3 is unclear, and may prove to be significantly lower than predicted by chemical equilibrium models. This may suggest that the T spectral class is extended to even cooler temperatures of around 400K [abridged]."}
{"text":"\nWe explore the feasibility of a mathematically sound and computationally simple eigenvalue based method for estimating the number of high-dimensional signals present in an additive white noise environment, when the number of available samples is relatively low. This procedure exploits eigenvalues from the population covariance matrix as an indicator of signal presence, as a way to overcome potential errors which could arise from eigenvector modelling. However, a fundamental limit is uncovered with the estimator, due to its incapacity to detect weak signals or close signals in the same frequency range. We define the effective number of identifiable signals equal to the 'signal' eigenvalues which surpass the noise variance multiplied by a factor greater than 1+\u221a(Dimensionality of system\/Sample size). Numerical experiments validate that the estimator correctly presents the true patterns of signal presence when in a large sample size\/dimensionality scenario and the effective number of signals in a large dimension\/sample size environment."}
{"text":"\nThe purpose of this article is to explore the systematic construction of gauged matter-coupled supergravity theories in two dimensions. By adding a particular topological term and coupling vector fields with minimal couplings, subgroups of the affine global symmetry group of toroidally compactified supergravity can be gauged and hidden symmetries that are not present in the ungauged theory can be detected. The parameters associated with the potential gaugings, such as p-form fluxes, geometric and non-geometric fluxes, are all combined into an embedding tensor. This tensor transforms within the basic representation of E_9 and provides an analysis for the infinite-dimensional class of maximally supersymmetric theories in two dimensions. Further investigations are conducted looking into the higher-dimensional origin of the different E_9 gradings."}
{"text":"\nThis paper evaluates how differences in demographic variance, or variance in population growth rate, influence the likelihood of a given genotype to succeed in a population. Utilizing the research of Engen and other related studies, it proposes a generalization regarding the interactions between determinable and random forces that shape the prevalence of certain alleles. By examining variance in life history parameters, evidence is presented that demonstrates the increased preference for genotypes that display less stochasticity in age-specific survival and fertility. Moreover, diffusion approximations and individual based simulations are utilized to measure the influence of different life history parameters on an organism's overall fitness. Ultimately, perturbation analyses of the growth rate and demographic variance may be crucial for pinpointing the impact of life history parameters on fitness in finite populations."}
{"text":"\nThis new study explores the behavior of quantum vacuum energy when exposed to gravitational acceleration. It is based on semitransparent plates that work on a massless scalar field and Rindler coordinates (tau,x,y,xi). When the Rindler coordinate xi is in a fixed position, the force of the system consisting of one or two plates can be measured. It is observed that when the acceleration is small the force of the system is equivalent to the product of the gravitational acceleration and the total mass comprising the mass of the plates, including the Casimir energy, plus the energy of the Casimir interaction between the plates. The behavior of the Casimir energy under gravitational acceleration is thus consistent with the equivalence principle."}

Our experiments focus on three-dimensional SU(2) pure Yang-Mills theory, with the goal of efficiently computing the dual amplitudes. Built upon the modern achievements of quantum gravity spin foam models, our algorithm allows for the Metropolis system to sample the dual ensemble.

{"text":"\nIn this research article, we examine baryonic behavior in a model of QCD from string theory created by Sakai and Sugimoto. We discover that mesons can form a unit five-dimensional \\$U(N_F) = U(1) \\times SU(N_F)$ Yang-Mills field, and baryons are classically represented as solitons with one Pontryagin number and electric charges that are equivalent to $N_c$. In the large 't Hooft coupling limit, the soliton is found to be quite small, allowing us to introduce an effective field $\\cal{B}$. This effective field connects to the mesons based on the structure of the soliton, and comes in the form of a direct magnetic connection to the $SU(N_F)$ power and a minimal connection to the $U(N_F)$ guide field. After dimension reduction, this analytic equation matches with all interaction terms between nucleons and an infinite amount of mesons in a way that is consistent with a large $N_c$ growth. Additionally, we found that all electromagnetic connections, resolved from the effective action with a holographic formula, are conveyed by an infinite number of vector mesons, which makes the baryon electromagnetic field factors completely vector-dominated. We estimate nucleon-meson attachments and anomalous magnetic moments, compared to nature."}

{"text":"\nThis article seeks to study the density of strong peak functions and peak points using the variational method. As a result, it is found that if a closed subspace $A$ in a complete metric space $K$ possesses a set of strong peak points, then this set is a norming subset of $A$. Furthermore, for a complex locally uniformly convex Banach space $X$, the set of all strong peak functions in $\\mathcal{A}(B_X)$ is a dense $G_\\delta$ subset.

{"text":"\nThis article looks at the methods used to measure the rate of mass loss from asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars by using radio data. Numerical modelling of the circumstellar emission from these stars is complex due to the interplay of physical and chemical processes. It is also a difficult task to determine the mass-loss rates from such testing, so a range of observational constraints, including multi-line radio data and radial brightness distributions, are used to estimate this rate. Among the methods employed to assess the mass-loss rate from AGB stars, the use of CO line emission radiative transfer modelling yields the most reliable results and can constrain the rate to within 50%. This is demonstrated by cross-comparison with methods such as dust radiative transfer modelling and dynamical models; these are largely consistent within a factor of three."}

{"text":"\nThe Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model, with three types of massless quarks in a quark number chemical potential $\\mu$, is used to study the spectrum of mass excitations of meson and diquark in both the color--flavor locked (CFL) phase of quark matter, for sufficiently large values of $\\mu > \\mu_c \\approx 330 \\ \\text{MeV}$, and in the chirally broken phase, for $\\mu < \\mu_c$. When the quark matter is in the chirally broken state, all nine pseudoscalar mesons appear as Nambu--Goldstone bosons and the scalar meson nonet has twice the mass of their corresponding dynamical quark mass. It was found, in the chirally broken state, that the pseudoscalar diquarks have no stable particles, but the scalar diquarks may be stable if the interaction within the diquark channel is very strong. In the CFL phase, all Nambu--Goldstone bosons, both scalar and pseudoscalar, appear as diquark excitations. However, too large a mass is found for these diquark resonances, with a mass value of 230 MeV. On the contrary, mesons in the CFL phase were found to be stable particles with a mass interval of 400 to 500 MeV, for $\\mu > \\mu_c$. This research probes into the masses of meson and diquark excitations in dense quark matter in the CFL and chirally broken phases."}

Our method is based on studying two-level systems and measuring the Fano factor peak, which has a direct link to the dephasing rate, in the super-Poissonian regime.

Preliminary one-dimensional studies show that the carbon detonation process is a multi-scale phenomenon, with the liberation of energy occurring on a length scale $10^6$ times smaller than the total reaction length. It is suggested that a multi-resolution approach can be used to tackle all the reaction lengths. Thermodynamic and composition profiles for different layers of carbon, iron and helium relevant to superbursts are also provided."}
{"text":"\nUsing general relativity and a microphysical equation of state simulations, we explore how the rotation rate and profile of stellar cores affect gravitational wave burst signals from their collapse. We have identified these signals to be of a generic type, named Type I, and have found a wide variety of models that produce a characteristic frequency around 718 Hz. To understand this frequency better, our analysis has quantified and discussed the micro- and macrophysical mechanisms responsible, including rotation, equation of state and deleptonization. Our results suggest that an efficiently searchable template for current and future detectors, of both interferometric and resonant types, could be formulated from the generic type of GW burst signals."}
{"text":"\nThis paper presents the findings of a mapping survey of 40 nearby spiral galaxies carried out using the Nobeyama 45-m telescope and focusing on the CO(1-0) band. The study was conducted with respect to the selected sample profile (RC3 morphological type in the range of Sa to Scd, distance not exceeding 25 Mpc, inclination angle not greater than 79deg (in accordance with RC3), flux at 100um amounting to at least 10 Jy and intact spiral structure). The results demonstrate that bar structure plays a major role in the concentration of molecular gas within the spiral galaxy's center, doing so more efficiently in stronger bars. About half of the molecular gas within the center is transported with the action of the bar. Additionally, it was revealed that non-barred spiral galaxies present lower levels of molecular gas central concentration than barred ones. These observations are consistent with a theory of long-lasting bars."}
{"text":"\nIn this article, we investigate the properties of stellar configurations and the space-time associated with them in $f(R)$ theories of gravity. We analyze the polytropic model of the Sun in an $f(R)=R-\\mu^4\/R$, and display how the stellar configuration in such a theory could, with the help of appropriate initial conditions, be tuned to the same characteristics as described by the Lane-Emden equation. Moreover, we provide evidence of a simple scaling relation between the solutions, and establish the correct analytic solution near the core of the star. We examine results from both analytical and numerical sources and determine that the environment around the Sun is incompatible with Solar System tests of gravity. Our numerical work implies that configurations with regular metrics at the centre result in a PPN parameter $\\gamma_{PPN}\\simeq1\/2$ beyond the star, hence suggesting that the Schwarzschild-de Sitter space-time is not the correct vacuum resolution for such structures. Incontrast, when focussing on the Schwarzschild-de Sitter metric as the exact external solution, we conclude that the stellar configuration stays the same, yet the metric is skewed at its core. Moreover, we explore the prospect of constructing an $f(R)$ theory that satisfies experiments in the Solar System, as well as analyse novel constraints that might be generated from the radius-mass relationship of stellar objects."}

We extract equilibrium quark and gluon distribution functions from the EOS, and show that this method enables a determination of the transport and other properties of the quark gluon plasma, which is then described via a quasi-particle model. The first EOS is a perturbative approach with contributions up to $O(g^5)$ and then an improved EOS with contributions up to $O(g^6 ln(\\frac{1}{g}))$ is presented that accounts for non-perturbative hard thermal contributions. We show the interaction effects are captured by the effective chemical potential of the gluons and quarks for both EOS. We determine the screening lengths as an application, and see drastic differences depending on the chosen EOS which could be used to differentiate them in heavy ion collisions."}
{"text":"\nThis article examines the chemical composition of the secondary stars in low mass X-ray binary systems, to gain insight into the formation of black holes and neutron stars. Through UVES\/VLT spectroscopy and the HIRES spectrum of Nova Scorpii 1994's secondary star (Israelian et al. 1999), we derive the atmospheric abundances of O, Mg, Al, Ca, Ti, Fe, and Ni using the $\\chi2$-minimization procedure and grid of synthetic spectra. The majority of the elements share similarities with solar values, while Na and primarily O, Mg, Si, and S have significantly augmented as compared to Galactic trends. We analyze existing supernova explosion models to constrain their parameters, such as the mass-cut and the explosion energy, in relation to relative abundances of elements like Si, S, Ca, Ti, Fe and Ni. Results indicate that a hypernova explosion of a 30-35 \\Msun progenitor star with a mass-cut between 2-3.5 \\Msun, is likely the formation process of the black hole. However, the output of these models vastly overestimates the concentrations of Al and Na that are found in the observed spectrum."}
{"text":"This article explores how the anisotropic nature of sound velocity in crystals can cause the phonon-mediated pairing of electrons to be non-local in space, allowing the formation of unconventional Cooper pairs with non-zero orbital momentums. The article additionally looks into the quantum phase transition from an unconventional d-wave superconducting state to a conventional s-wave superconductor under increased electron density. Finally, it is demonstrated how rotational symmetry breaking can occur as a result of reduced Coulomb repulsion in the strong-coupling limit, thus removing some restrictions on unconventional pairing. Ultimately, the study reveals that conventional phonons, not superexchange, are the cause of the d-wave symmetry of cuprate superconductors, where on-site Coulomb repulsion is strong."}
{"text":"\nWe examine two processes containing second order long range dependence generated by heavy tailed durations (referred to as duration-driven long range dependence, or DDLRD). Through theoretical measures and a simulation study, we gain an understanding of the limiting distributions and properties of suitable standardized discrete Fourier transforms (DFTs) and sample autocovariances. Low frequecies of the standardized DFT converge to a stable law, and fixed lags of standardized sample autocovariances are degenerate. High frequencies of the standardized DFTs converge to a Gaussian law. We also gauge the performance of a semiparametric log periodogram regression estimator in approximating the memory parameter. Our research finds that the asymptotic results are comparable for both DDLRD processes examined."}
{"text":" Using an automated image processing tool, we studied the patterns of locomotor movement of E. orientalis and E. vuilleti over 24 hours and multiple days. Our analysis showed that the locomotion of both species was cyclically changed during the day. Activity for both species of Eupelmidae began during the illumination period and was similar in essence. However, the activity of E. vuilleti began around 4-5 hours earlier than that of E. orientalis, giving it an advantage when it came to competitive interactions in traditional grain stores after the cowpea harvest. This difference in activity start times serves to reduce instances of these two species coming into contact with one another."}
{"text":"A novel free energy density incorporating bending and surface tensions of membranes, chirality, and the orientation of tilting molecules is introduced. The theory explains the self-assembled chiral lipid membranes of DC$_{8,9}$PC, predicting the formation of toruses with a radius ratio exceeding $\\sqrt{2}$, as well as helical ripples in tubules. The pitch angles of these helical ripples are estimated to be close to observed values (namely 5$^\\circ$ and 28$^\\circ$) with the most frequency. Furthermore, the theory explains twisted ribbons of achiral cationic amphiphiles interacting with chiral tartrate counterions and suggests that their width-to-pitch ratio is proportional to the relative concentration difference of left- and right-handed enantiomers\u2014something that is in agreement with experimental findings."}
{"text":"\nAn investigation has been conducted to examine the possibility of mass rearing the native gregarious ectoparasitoid Monoksa dorsiplana, which emerges from Pseudopachymeria spinipes (Bruchidae) seeds in South America, on a different host, Callosobruchus maculatus, for use as a biological control against Leguminosae species. Studies show that when density of egg-laying females increased from 1:1 to 5:1, egg-clutch size per host rose and mortality of eggs laid also raised. Additionally, the ratio of males and females tended to balance, differing from single egg-laying female per host cases. Correlation studies between adult weight of parasites and clutch size display a negative trend, indicating that weight of adults decreased as egg-clutch size increased. To further research applicability of M. dorsiplana to bruchid C. maculatus control in stored beans, the effect of its mass rearing in laboratory circumstances must be studied."}
{"text":"\nWe take a closer look at the X-ray emission of the brightest galaxy cluster in Perseus, A426, using Chandra data. This reveals ripples with quasi-concentric circles, likely caused by sound waves, that equate to an energy flux within 75-100 kpc of the core, with a correspondingly long cooling time of 4-5 Gyr. Further outward, these ripple patterns indicate energy loss, as well as some newly found large ripples, and a possible buble, that indicate activity within the past hundred million years. We examine the the radial distribution of metals, noticing that it peaks at about 40 kpc and is clumpy on  5 kpc scales. We moreover analyze the soft and hard X-ray filaments within a 50 kpc radius and find that the pressure caused by electrons, responsible for the inverse Compton emission, is amplified nearer to the core and falls off quickly after 40 kpc. Lastly, no thermal gas is discovered in the radio bubble and to prove otherwise, the gas temperature would have to exceed 50 keV."}
{"text":"\nThis article presents late phase spectroscopic and photometric observations of the Type Ib supernova (SN) 2005bf made with the Subaru telescope. Emission lines have been detected with blueshifts of 1,500-2,000 km\/s. The line luminosities suggest that a blob or jet containing ~ 0.1-0.4 M_sun of material was driven out near the center-of-mass velocity of ~2,000-5,000 km\/s. This, combined with the low optical output at the late phase of these observations would limit the amount of synthesized 56Ni to ~0.08 M_sun. This value contradicts the amount needed to explain the main peak luminosity. An alternative scenario is then proposed to explain the late phase observations; a newly born, strongly magnetized neutron star (magnetar) with a surface magnetic field of ~10^14-15 gauss and an initial spin period of ~10 ms could serve as the heating source. This would link SN 2005bf to seemingly unrelated X-ray Flash events such as SN 2006aj."}
{"text":"\nThe static inter-quark potential between two gauge invariant colour charges is studied via the approach initiated by Marinari et al., which utilizes Polyakov lines of limited temporal extent in the Coulomb gauge. At short spatial separations, our results affirm the validity of the hypothesis. However, by increasing the distance between the charges, Gribov copies obstruct the usual non-perturbative way for identifying distinct gauge invariant colour states. We present evidence that examining the average of the gauges over all Gribov copies can guarantee the conservation of gauge invariance, thus allowing us to consider the Polyakov lines and the related, gauge invariant quark-antiquark state across all distance scales. Our analysis, backed by extensive lattice simulations, ascertain that the interpolating state has a strong correlation with the quark-antiquark ground state as well as the full static inter-quark potential regardless of the distance. Additionally, a graphical illustration of the Gribov copies on the lattice is provided."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate the morphology of hard X-rays (18-30 keV) from the Coma cluster of galaxies through an extensive (1.1 Ms) examination with the ISGRI imager on board the \\emph{INTEGRAL} satellite. We find that the extension of the source in a North-East to South-West (SW) direction ($\\sim 17'$) is notably beyond the size of the ISGRI's point spread function, and the centroid of the image of the source in the 18-30 keV band does not align with the centroid in the 1-10 keV band. We compare different models of source morphology to the data and find that an elliptical source best fits the data. In this case, the extension is in the direction of the subcluster moving towards the core of the Coma cluster. If the SW excess is the result of an isolated point source, we discover no strong, correlated X-ray source, only the closest being the quasar EXO 1256+281 $6.1'$ away. This clarification of hard X-ray emission from the Coma cluster therefore verifies the presence of an extended hard X-ray source to the Southwest of the cluster core."}
{"text":"\nIn this article, we present a self-affirmation model to explain the observed distributions of goals scored by football teams in home and away games. The model accounts for the highly cooperative nature of football that results in a deviation from the predicted distributions by Bernoulli randomized trials. We find that the tails of the distributions are well described by negative binomial or generalized extreme value distributions. By implementing a simple component of self-affirmation and comparing the football score data of leagues in Europe and international tournaments, we found notable differences between men\u2019s and women's leagues, in addition to the German leagues during the cold war times. We conclude that the self-affirmation model proposes accurate descriptions of the statistically observed deviations from the Gaussian distributions."}
{"text":"\nThe present research studies the effects of multiple, non-centrally located ionisation sources on the temperature and ionisation structure of HII regions, utilising the 3D Monte Carlo photoionisation code MOCASSIN. The findings suggest that the actual temperature fluctuations caused by the stellar distribution, rather than large-scale temperature gradients caused by other gas properties, are not a major source of error in metallicity studies. Furthermore, it is found that the distributed configuration of stars leading to lower ionisation parameters can bias the metallicities derived from integrated emission line spectra. In light of these results, the geometric distribution of ionisation sources may partly explain the large fluctuations in metallicity values determined using model-calibrated empirical techniques."}
{"text":"\nBy utilizing polarimetric observations at 1420 MHz of ELAIS N1, our Dominion Radio\nAstrophysical Observatory Planck Deep Fields project revealed 83 sources with polarized\nemission over a region of 7.43 square degrees.

Moreover, these faint polarized\nsources exhibited a much higher fractional polarization than the stronger ones. After\nassociating the polarized sources with galaxies from the Spitzer Wide Area Infrared\nExtragalactic Survey, the results show that most of these galaxies are associated with\ndusty AGNs or ellipticals with aging stellar populations while a small percentage (12%)\nof the sources are not detected in the SWIRE data.

{"text":"\nStudies of rapid oscillations in source-free areas often utilise a vanishing time average potential to capture charged particles. It has been hypothesised that a particle's motion in such circumstances can be predicted from a static, phase-insensitive effective potential. This study unveils a new phenomenon and reveals that a particle's motion and trapping conditions are in fact very dependent on their initial phase, even for very high frequencies. We explain this through a transformation according to the potential's initial phase, which has not previously been considered. Our theory is backed up with numerical simulations, as well as suggesting a simple experiment to test our claims. This finding could lead to innovative ways of manipulating the dynamics of particles subject to intense oscillations."}

To this end, we have adjusted the isolation cuts to improve the signal\/background ratio by $\\sim25%$ compared to CMS publications, and incorporated a large $\\Delta\\phi$ cut of $40^0$ between the photon and leading jet which further contributes to an overall gain of $\\sim42%$ in S\/B."}
{"text":"The aim of this work is to assess the accuracy of the DFT+U approach in the modelling of heme systems, which are commonly used in organometallic chemistry but have so far been insufficiently described by LDA, GGA, and other hybrid functionals. In particular, our findings demonstrate that a U parameter of around 4 eV enables the accurate prediction of spin states and molecular geometries in accordance with experimental evidence. We also demonstrate that the DFT+U approach outperforms more time and computationally expensive quantum-chemistry methods at a lower cost. Finally, we study the possibility of deriving the U parameter from first principles by means of self-consistent linear response theory, and show that while this approach can yield promising results, some overestimation of U value is present."}
{"text":"\nThis paper examines the long-term evolution of supermassive black hole binaries in galactic nuclei with short relaxation times, where the binary is able to progress beyond its stalling point via continued interactions with stars. The study was performed using robust N-body integrations and a novel Fokker-Planck model, which considers binary-induced changes in stellar density. Results indicate that gravitational wave coalescence is likely to occur within 10 Gyr in nuclei with velocity dispersions below 80 km\/s, resulting in a density profile of a flat core containing an inner, compact cluster. Moreover, mass deficits up to 4x the binary mass can form prior to coalescence."}
{"text":"\nWe examine the two-dimensional lattice spin models of the square and triangular lattice Heisenberg models, using the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method, and find that it can be utilized to effectively measure the magnetization ordering. We discover that it is essential to extrapolate local values obtained from the DMRG calculations using the truncation error and not the square root, as had been previously assumed. To improve finite-size scaling of the clusters, we introduce cyclic boundary conditions and fixed magnetization fields. The finite-size analysis of the effective sigma-model and spin-wave theory provide further insights about the scaling behavior. These extrapolations so obtained enable us to attain the value of the order parameter for the square lattice with a precision similar to those obtained from quantum Monte Carlo. For the triangular lattice, the order parameter of M = 0.205(15) reveals that the three-sublattice magnetic order exists."}
{"text":"\nThis article looks at the SLEs of self-dual Z(N) spin systems at the critical point. For N=2 and 3, these models represent the Ising and three-state Potts models respectively. By studying the chiral algebras represented by N>5 critical self-dual Z(N) spin models, we show that two operators satisfy a two-level null vector condition, which for N>=4 presents an additional term from symmetry currents. We suggest a definition for the interfaces within the Z(N) lattice models. The scaling limit of these interfaces is expected to be described by the SLE_{4(N+1)\/(N+2)} and SLE_{4(N+2)\/(N+1)} processes, when taken at the self-dual critical point and for N>=4."}
{"text":"\nWe explore the behavior of a spin-polarized, magnetically-trapped mixture of $^7$Li and $^{87}$Rb atoms in the ultracold regime, measuring the thermalization velocity of the two species and quantifying the absolute value of the associated triplet s-wave scattering length. We obtain a scattering length of $|a_{7,87}|=(59\\pm19)a_{\\rm B}$ between the two atoms. We also propose an experiment designed to identify the sign of $a_{7,87}$ by studying the mixture through the condensed regime. Evaluating the coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations based on the assumption of a positive sign of the scattering length, we find that phase separation of the two clouds will occur, stabilized by mean-field interactions and allowing for substantial populations of condensed $^7$Li atoms before collapse. Observation of this stabilization phenomenon would surely reveal the sign of the scattering length and therefore lead to a better understanding of the interactions between $^7$Li and $^{87}$Rb."}
{"text":"\nThe motion of a black hole relative to its host galaxy's centre of gravity drives a notable response from its surrounding stellar population. Analytically studying the case of a harmonic potential suggests that half of the stars on circular orbits gain a positive boost and move outward, while the other half shift to a lower energy orbit. Meanwhile, the black hole stays on an orbit of fixed amplitude, serving only as a catalyst to the evolution of the energy distribution of stars. Numerical integration reveals that the influence of the black hole extends to a radius of 3 to 4 times the influence radius, R_bh. It is accompanied by changes to the velocity field in addition to the density map. Nevertheless, a kinematic fingerprint of the black hole's motion remains, manifesting in the stellar line-of-sight mean velocity 18% of the local root mean-square velocity dispersion sigma."}

{"text":"\nThis paper examines the Bohr-Einstein photon box thought experiment, which can be seen as a precursor of the EPR experiment, and explores the concept of complementarity. It is proposed that by making pertinent measurements on the box, the photon can be prepared, long after it has escaped, in either of two states. In order for consistency to be maintained, it is also necessary for the measurements on the box to be complementary. Initially, it appears that these measurements can be carried out precisely at the same time, as they refer to different systems (the center of mass of the box and an internal clock). However, when this is explored in detail, it is revealed that these measurements are linked in such a way that the commutators become non-zero when applied to the time of the photon's escape, affirming Bohr's predictions. Moreover, our calculations uncover a 'fine structure', based on \\textit{when} the measurements are done, which ultimately alters the quantum description of the photon. This analysis provides insight into how the dynamics cooperate to preserve complementarity and reflects how the later EPR thought experiment was argued."}
{"text":"\nThe concept of complementarity is at the heart of the photon box thought experiment proposed by Einstein and Bohr. By performing two different types of measurements on the box, it is possible to ``prepare'' the photon in a complementary state long after it has left the box. At first glance, it would seem that one could simultaneously measure the center of mass of the box and its internal clock with arbitrary precision. However, upon closer inspection, this is not the case. Through explicit calculations, it can be shown that although it is possible to measure both quantities, they develop non-zero commutators when calculated back to the time of photon emission. This illustrates how the details of the dynamics act in accord with Bohr's complementarity argument. Furthermore, when studying the uncertainty of these complementary quantities, a \u201cfine structure\" can be observed, depending on when the box measurement is performed, which brings this thought experiment into close relation with the later EPR thought experiment."}
{"text":"\nWe concisely consider a quantum Brownian oscillator which is subject to an external, classical force and connected linearly to an environment of various quantum oscillators at temperatures of zero or higher levels. We discover that, for an extensive range of spectral densities at an arbitrary temperature and coupling strength, the HPZ master equation for the reduced density matrix can assume closed functional forms. Examining this novel result further, we work through the corresponding master equation to evaluate diverse quantities, such as the uncertainty function, of the system. This consequently yields an expression useful for the exploration of the fundamental quantum limit concerning to research of macroscopic quantum phenomena and experiments relying on exactitude measures at icy temperatures. Irrespective of the state's initial properties, the density matrix eventually settles as a Gaussian matrix with aforesaid mean regulated by the external force and deviation set by the thermal reservoir. If a Laurent-series formula is not applicable, the resolution of the master equation is paralleled to that of a classical parametric oscillator, with the oscillator's parametric frequency determined by the unsolved parameters in the master equation. The movement of such a system is thought to replicate that of the simpler, explicitly determined evolutionary process for the Laurent-series. "}
{"text":"\nThe properties of the filled skutterudite compounds PrOs$_4$As$_{12}$ and LaOs$_4$As$_{12}$ were investigated by employing magnetic field-orientation dependent susceptibility and de Haas-van Alphen measurements up to 40 T. Distinctive peaks in the susceptibility of PrOs$_4$As$_{12}$, which could be ascribed to metamagnetic transitions, divided the low-field antiferromagnetic and high-field paramagnetic metal phases. The de Haas-van Alphen experiments further indicated a remarkable likeness in Fermi-surface topology between PrOs$_4$As$_{12}$ and LaOs$_4$As$_{12}, as well as moderate congruence between measured and bandstructure-calculated values for the lattice of PrOs$_4$As$_{12}.

{"text":"\nI present a Bayesian approach to quantifying uncertainty in linear regression analysis of astronomical data, accounting for factors such as heteroscedastic and potentially correlated measurement errors and intrinsic scatter in the relationship. This includes generalizations applicable to the presence of multiple independent variables, non-detections, and selection effects (e.g. Malmquist bias). I use a Gibbs sampler to draw random samples from the yet-unknown probability distribution of parameters, given the observed data. Simulations demonstrate the superiority of this model to other estimators in cases where the measurement errors significantly influence the variance, when the source detection fraction is small, and when the intrinsic distribution of the independent variables is not a mixture of Gaussians. Lastly, I use my model to investigate the connection between X-ray spectral slope and Eddington ratio for 39 radio-quiet quasars, finding consistent results with previous studies: the X-ray spectral slope softens as the Eddington ratio rises."}

{"text":"\n\nWe employ Monte Carlo simulations to re-evaluate the sluggish behavior of a silica melt over a broad range of temperature, starting from 6100 K to 2750 K. We observe that the dynamics of the system follows trends seen in the results of the molecular dynamics experiments, particularly in the long-term alpha-relaxation regime. On the other hand, the Monte Carlo algorithm successfully reduces the intense thermal vibrations in the short term, exhibited in the results of the molecular dynamics simulations, known as the Boson peak. This contributes to our assessment of the silica dynamics through a mode-coupling theory perspective, as disparities in such a theory have been partly due to such oscillations. That said, this theory only paints a qualitative, rather than quantitative, representation of our data, giving uncertainty to the theory of the avoided singularity phenomenon in this system. We moreover investigate the manifestation of dynamic heterogeneity, along with the decoupling of translational movement and structural relaxation, along with the rise of a four-point dynamic susceptibility. We further observe dynamic heterogeneity to be less prominent than with other glass-forming models, albeit of the same character."}
{"text":"This paper examines the sound generation in an apparatus composed of a bore combined with a reed valve. Going beyond previous research (Debut, 2004), the input impedance of the bore is expressed as the sum of mode components. The acoustic pressure created can subsequently be calculated. The airstream traversing through the bore is regulated by the motion of the reed, which is taken to be a single degree of freedom oscillator. The usage of ODE solvers enables the production of self-sustained vibrations which are managed by mouth pressure and the player's embouchure. Results establish the involvement of all the components in the process of mode alignment. An important feature is the mutual effect of the reed and bore resonance during surging blowing pressure variations, with oscillation threshold being repositioned by the reed's damping and natural frequency. The steady-state oscillations are also explored and tested with analogies to the outcomes of harmonic balance technique and digital sound synthesis."}

{"text":"\nThe radio continuum and polarization properties of the supernova remnant G156.2+5.7 were examined in detail at a wavelength of 6 cm for the first time. We obtained an integrated flux density of S6cm = 2.5+-0.5Jy and a spectral index of alpha=-0.48+-0.08, with little variation across the SNR. In addition, the polarization showed high levels of emission from the SNR shell and from a central patch. We also derived the rotation measure distribution from the 6 cm and 11 cm polarization data, with RM gradients of opposite directions in the SNR shell. Moreover, our results indicate a very well ordered magnetic field along the shell periphery as well as a potential toroidal magnetic field component, suggesting the compression of an ambient magnetic field.

This analysis reveals that the stability of this splay state depends heavily on the ratio between the pulse-width and inter-spike interval. Three components comprise the spectrum: (i) correlates to the original mean-field analysis; (ii) evaluates the instability of finite-frequency modes; (iii) captures isolated eigenvalues that are connected to the individual pulse and can cause great instabilities (with the Floquet exponent proportionate to the network size). Furthermore, it is also concluded that inhibitory coupling holds the capability to provide a stable splay state."}

Results of a dimensional continuation technique are used to explain 1\/f^gamma-contribution to the two-point correlation function of electromagnetic fields and ultimately the voltage power spectrum.

Thanks to being measurement-based, BUFFET can be used independently of the data rate and payload size and is thus an autonomous and distributed admission control scheme."}
{"text":"\nThis paper examines the homogenized spectral problem of finding exact solutions to linear differential operators $T_{\\la}$, with each $Q_{i}(z)$ a polynomial of degree at most $i$, with respect to their spectral parameter $\\la$, under certain nondegeneracy assumptions. It is shown for any positive integer $n$, that there exist $k$ distinct values $\\la_{n,j}$ and associated polynomial eigenfunctions, with degree $n$, which are split into the corresponding $k$ different families according to their asymptotic behavior. It is also proposed and confirmed that these functions possess an algebraic equation relating their derivatives to the polynomials which defines the operator and admits a branch near infinity in $\\bCP$. As a resolution, this provides a compactly supported probability measure revealing a Cauchy transform of such functions."}
{"text":"\nThis paper provides concrete calculations of the cohomology of affine Artin groups of types A_n, B_n, and \\tilde{A}_n with non-trivial local coefficients. The core result demonstrates the cohomology of the B_n Artin group when coefficients are taken from the module \\Q[q^{\\pm 1}, t^{\\pm 1}], where the first (n-1) standard generators act by a (-q)-multiplicative influence, and the last one acts by a (-t)-multiplicative influence. The proof uses technical results from earlier papers, calculations over a certain spectral sequence, and Shapiro's lemma for determining the cohomology for the remaining batches of cases. As an extra outcome of this article, there is the explicit construction of finite CW-complexes that encase a free action of the Artin groups, oftentimes exhibiting K(\\pi,1) space properties. Furthermore, concise formulas are revealed for calculating the Euler-characteristics of these orbit spaces."}
{"text":"\nThe bond breaking process has been tested using the auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo method, where paths in the path integrals are controlled with an approximate phase condition based on a trial wave function. Single Slater determinants from unrestricted Hartree-Fock calculations and multiple-determinant trial wave functions from multi-configuration self-consistent-field method were used to provide an assessment of the accuracy improvement with the increase of computational cost. This was tested using BH and N$_{2}$ molecules and the H$_{50}$ chain as examples. Ultimately it was found that these trial wave functions yielded excellent results across the entire period from the equilibrium point to the dissociation limit."}
{"text":"\nThis paper presents a study of a sample of massive galaxies at redshifts of 1.4 to 2.5 with visual magnitudes K_{Vega} of 22 or less, taken from the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey. We evaluate the stellar mass and star formation rate by comparing mid- and far-infrared wavelengths from Spitzer, to ultraviolet and submillimeter wavelengths. For galaxies of moderate luminosity, we are able to estimate the star formation rate consistently through the available data. Nevertheless, the majority of massive galaxies and those with a luminosity of 10^{11}L_sun or more contain a mid-IR excess, which is most likely caused by the presence of obscured active nuclei, as has been determined in a previous study. This research finds a strong and linear relationship between Stellar Mass and SFR for galaxies that are detected 24um. The SFR at z=2 is observed to be 4 and 30 times greater than for star forming galaxies at z=1 and z=0 respectively. The ULIRGs (ultra luminous infrared galaxies) of z=2 appear to be normal in terms of ultraviolet light, additionally, the activity appears to be endured over a comparatively long period of 400 million years. The density of ULIRGS are lower than is predicted by current galaxy formation models; additionally, there is an underestimation of the normalization of the mass-SFR correlation."}
{"text":"\nAt redshifts of 1.4<z<2.5 and with K magnitudes of -22 (in the Vega system), approximately 20-30% of galaxies seen by the Spitzer Multiband Imaging Photometer for Spitzer (MIPS) at 24um show more mid-IR emission than is expected from the amount of star formation seen in other multiwavelength data. These same galaxies also have a near-IR infrared excess, with the rest-frame spectral energy distribution peaking longward of 1.6um. When stacking Chandra X-ray data for these galaxies, a significant hard X-ray detection is found at rest-frame energies >6.2 keV. Furthermore, the X-ray spectrum increases steeply at >10 keV, indicating the presence of obscured AGN (Active Galactic Nuclei) with N_H~10^24 cm^-2 and L_{2-8keV}~(1-4)x10^43 erg\/s. The large sky and space densities of these mid-IR excess galaxies suggest a previously unknown population of distant, heavily obscured AGN, as was theorized through X-ray background synthesis models. As galaxy mass increases to M~10^11 M_sun, the fraction of the galaxies with mid-IR excess also increases, reaching ~50-60%. This can be attributed to 'downsizing' in galaxy formation. Comparing the inferred black hole growth to the global star formation rate gives a ratio of blackhole to stellar mass similar to that of galaxies in the local universe today, showing concurrent growth of both as massive galaxies form."}
{"text":"\nTwo-Time Physics opens the possibility for a more in-depth description of the space-time by allowing the Standard Model of Particles and Forces to be successfully expressed as a two-time field theory. This approach provides a resolution for the strong CP problem of QCD, found through its higher dimensional symmetry structures. As a part of this paper, a process is described to build the duals of the Standard Model using the same four and two dimensional theory as holographic images. Particularly, the effects of a variety of interesting curved spacetimes in (d-1)+1 dimensions are studied in order to demonstrate the effects of simpler gauge choices made while creating the master 4+2 dimensional field theory. The result is the establishment of Klein-Gordon field theories with SO(d,2) symmetry. Furthermore, more challenging and more intricate gauge choices, such as those related to mass, are proposed for future work. This progression suggests a new framework of dualities and hidden symmetries found both in the macroscopic and microscopic universes and at the classical and quantum levels. Through this, One-Time Physics may be used to confirm the 2T-physics predictions through theory and experiment, providing a distinct approach toward the unification of theories."}
{"text":"\nWe have conducted analysis of a thin closed layer of moisture to determine the effects of a change in the downhill saturation on the moisture content of hillslopes. When an area with a fixed saturation level is present at the boundary, the flow speed immediately upslope is decreased and the moisture content correspondingly increased in order to preserve the equilibrium flux. Our integrations indicate a pooling height of more than 10 km for a fully saturated zone of mixed silty or clay soils, but for each 10% decrease in boundary-zone saturation degree, the pooling height is decreased by around an order of magnitude. This drying of downhill saturated zones, with the increased outflow of moisture and corresponding decrease in mountain moisture content, could explain why ~69% of water is unaccounted for at La Luz \/ Fresnal Watershed upstream spring-box diversions in Alamogordo, NM, USA."}
{"text":"\nIn this article, we explore theoretically the potential for a superconducting electromechanical oscillator to act as a very high-quality factor (Q) clock. This system consists of a strong-pinning type-II superconductor loop subjected to both external force and magnetic fields. This loop can oscillate in the upright position with a frequency tunable between 10\u20131000 Hz and a current induced in the system. This article's focus is on evaluating sources of losses and how these losses can be suppressed. We will analyze how losses become negligible and a very high Q exceeding 10^(10) can in principle be achieved with the oscillator under cryogenic temperatures and high vacuum, with a sufficiently uniform magnetic field. We further discuss the possible utilization of this oscillator as a low-frequency, high-Q clock. Since the publication of this paper, its ideas have been explored in various applications ranging from metrology, quantum systems and gravimetry, both by the author and others."}
{"text":"\nThis paper investigates the capacity of sparse multipath channels in the ultrawideband (UWB) regime. By taking recent measurement results into consideration, we introduce a model to capture the sparsity present in the channel. We analyse the effect of this sparsity on two separate metrics of spectral efficiency in the UWB\/low-SNR limit. Our findings imply that the required scaling in coherence time with SNR can be reduced, the channels attain asymptotic coherence in suitable settings, and the need for peaky signals to achieve capacity is eliminated or reduced in sparse environments."}
{"text":"\nThis article examines the effects of sparsity in multipath fading channels on non-coherent capacity and reliability in the wideband regime. A training-based communication scheme that uses short-time Fourier (STF) signaling waveforms is proposed and is used to analyze how sparsity in delay-Doppler correlations produces time-frequency coherence in the STF domain. Results suggest that sparse channels are asymptotically coherent: the gap between coherent and non-coherent extremes vanishes in the limit of large signal space dimension without the need for peaky signaling. Furthermore, a tradeoff between channel diversity and learnability is identified, providing insight into how appropriate signaling duration can be selected to optimize error exponent at any rate."}
{"text":"\nIn non-central heavy ion collisions at high energies, the parton system yields a strong orbital angular momentum which leads to global polarization of quarks and anti-quarks against the reaction plane as determined by the impact-parameter and beam momentum. This was initially evaluated in an effective static potential model, backed up later by QCD at finite temperature utilizing the hard-thermal-loop re-summed gluon propagator. The explicable outcomes, such as global hyperon polarization and spin alignment of vector mesons, are remarketed. Some preliminary results from the dedicated RHIC measurements are available. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the idea of global quark polarization and its resultant manifestations."}
{"text":"  This paper investigates the issue of scanning and sequential decision making on multi-dimensional data fields damaged by noise.

The first part of this two-part study focused on decision making without external noise and this second part aims to compare the optimal performance of this situation to the noisy case at hand."}

{"text":"\nThis research employs the ``Scenario Machine'' to analyze X-ray binaries and the X-ray luminosity functions (XLFs),in different types of galaxies. Monte Carlo simulations were used to simulate the evolution and spin of neutron stars, along with other binary systems. We found that the XLF for each galaxy depend on its star formation rate, as well as other evolutionary parameters of binary systems. We calculated the cumulative and differential XLFs for a constant star formation rate galaxy and other curves which depicted the evolution of the X-ray luminosity. This research revealed the effectiveness of the Scenario Machine in analyzing XLFs and helped to understand their dependence on the star formation rate and other important parameters."}
{"text":"\nWe review the effects of Faraday rotation on polarisation of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation as it passes through magnetised plasma. We compute B-mode angular spectra of this secondary polarisation from Faraday rotation in galaxies and clusters with masses from $10^{11}$ to $10^{16.5} M_\\odot$. We analyse the dependence of this magnitude on the electron density and magnetic field profiles, taking into account both beta-profiles and Navarro-Frenk-White dark matter distributions. We also incorporate the redshift evolution of the magnetic field to our model and estimate the influence of its coherence length on the polarisation. The overall secondary B-mode power spectrum is proportional to $\\sigma_8^{5-6}$, where $\\sigma_8$ is the normalisation parameter. At 30 GHz and $\\sigma_8 = 0.8$, its values fall in between $0.01 {\\mu \\rm K}^2$ and $4 \\times 10^{-3} {\\mu \\rm K}^2$ and the maximum amplitude is seen at $l=10^4$ when the field is maximally coherent. If the coherence length is smaller, the power will be weaker and peak at higher multipoles."}
{"text":"\nThis investigation uses deep HST, VLT, Spitzer and Chandra surveys of the Chandra Deep Field South to uncover the population of hidden sources that are manifesting as Compton Thick AGNs. We demonstrate that selection of sources based on their UV emission reflected in the infrared, and their red colour, reveal a distinct source population whose infrared luminosity is dominated by AGN activity. Analysis of the X-ray properties of these extreme sources confirms that up to 80$\\pm15$% of them are highly obscured, Compton thick AGNs. We conclude that these sources account for a factor of two in excess of those expected from X-ray selection of unobscured and moderately obscured AGNs."}
{"text":"\nIn this study, the propagation of electromagnetic waves in an almost circular bundle of closely packed, identical, and metallic carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is investigated. A quantitative comparison of the results obtained by employing an equivalent-multishell approach to those of a many-body technique demonstrated a reasonable agreement for infinite, moderately high CNT bundles. The analysis of guided-wave propagation revealed that the slow-wave coefficients increased with the number of CNTs and converged to a value of one in thicker bundles, mimicking the properties of a macroscopic metallic wire. Additionally, it was determined that CNT bundles feature an azimuthally nonsymmetric guided wave at low frequencies, in contrast to a single CNT. Further, the polarizability scalar, antenna efficiency, and edge effects present in finite-length CNT bundles in the long-wavelength regime and across a broad frequency range from the terahertz to the near-infrared spectrum were examined. Moreover, the antenna efficiency of the bundles showed an impressive four orders of magnitude improvement at the first resonance as compared to that of a single CNT, making them viable for use in the design and development of CNT-bundle antennas and composite materials."}
{"text":"\nThe magnetic properties of submicron-sized Co hollow spheres in chains have been examined. It is found that the average diameter (500-800 nm) and shell thickness (approx. 60 nm) are both microcrystalline, with a typical crystallite size of 20-35 nm. Using zero-field-cooled MZFC(T) measurements at a field intensity of 90 Oe, the blocking temperature was determined to be approximately 325 K, while the corresponding effective anisotropy was calculated as 4.6*10^4 J\/m^3. HC(T) analysis generated a slightly higher blocking temperature of 395 K, combined with an effective anisotropy of 5.7*10^4 J\/m^3. These values are around one order of magnitude lower than the magnetocrystalline anisotropy (3~5*10^5 J\/m^3) of hcp Co in bulk form. The magnetization reversal was also noted to adhere to a nucleation rotational mode, characterised by an effective switching volume of 2.3*10^3 nm^3, resulting in an effective diameter of 16.4 nm - relatively close to the coherence length of Co (approx. 15 nm). Finally, some possible explanations for the reduced anisotropy of the Co hollow spheres have been briefly touched upon."}
{"text":"In this article, an analysis of the Cosmological Coincidence Problem is presented and applied to the Einstein Universe and Friedman Dust Universe models. Using the Dust Universe Solution to the Dark Energy Problem, it is demonstrated that the generic coincidence problem within the Einstein universe is due to a misunderstanding of the magnitude of dark energy and the time governing the relation between dark and normal energy density. It is concluded that the degeneracy between different measurement epoch times can be eliminated, providing implications for how dark matter and dark energy interact to form visible matter and how the latter is related to clumping of the former. The appendices then provide further detail on dark energy and quantum dark energy related topics in the context of cosmology."}
{"text":"\nThis paper examines the provision of which-way information, for instance in a two-slit experiment, and specifically studies the assumption made about the position of a particle prior to a position measurement occurring. Found to be lacking in the standard postulates of quantum mechanics, the paper proposes the so-called 'quantum typicality rule' to effectively address this issue. This remarkable rule is analogous to the Born rule in terms of explanations of the results of statistically conducted experiments. As such, it can be seen as a generalization of the Born rule. Furthermore, it is suggested that this rule could lead to a trajectory-based formulation of quantum mechanics. Such a formulation envisions a closed quantum system being represented as a 'quantum process', which effectively replaces the usual frequentist interpretation of probabilities with the quantum typicality rule."}
{"text":"\nThis article introduces integral representations of Whittaker functions for the classical Lie algebras sp(2l), so(2l) and so(2l+1). These representations are an extension of Givental's integral representation of gl(l+1)-Whittaker functions that has the special property of being recursive in nature. It was previously shown that the gl(l+1) integral recursion operator is connected to the Baxter Q-operator of the corresponding affine Lie algebra. We demonstrate this connection by constructing Q-operators for $\\hat{so(2l)}$, $\\hat{so(2l+1)}$ and a twisted version of $\\hat{gl(2l)}$. Our results suggest that the link between recursion integral operators and degenerated Q-operators for classical Lie algebras is generalizable."}
{"text":"\nThe scattering of protons and antiprotons with high energies at a collider yields Weizs\\\"acker--Williams photons, offering an opportunity to explore exclusive photoproduction of heavy vector mesons in a regime that could not be accessed by the HERA accelerator. In this paper, we investigate exclusively the $J\/\\psi$ photoproduction in proton-proton (RHIC, LHC) and proton-antiproton (Tevatron) collisions. Differential distributions in $t_1, t_2, y, \\phi$ as well as transverse momentum distributions of $J\/\\Psi$ mesons have been computed and analyzed. What makes this different from electroproduction experiments is that this time both the beam particles can function as a source of photons. Thus, large interference terms emerge in the azimuthal angle distributions for a broad range of rapidities of the produced meson. Effects of absorptive corrections have been also taken into account, causing a charge asymmetry in rapidity distributions which is larger for proton-proton reactions compared to proton-antiproton processes. The findings of our research can be useful in the search for odderon exchange in experimental studies."}
{"text":"\nWe conducted a comprehensive survey of Local Group dwarf spheroidal galaxy Leo II utilizing the 8.2-meter Subaru Telescope at its Prime Focus Camera. The scope of the study was extended to an area of 26.67 x 26.67 arcmin^2, which is much larger than Leo II's tidal radius (8.63 arcmin), reaching toward a faint V ~26, up to 1 mag deeper than the turning point of its main sequence stars. The number density profiles of bright and faint red giant branch stars adjusted their slopes at the tidal radius then expanded beyond it with weaker slopes. A smoothed out surface brightness map implied the existence of a small, globular cluster luminosity substructure beyond the tidal radius. It was also noticed that the horizontal branch morphological index demonstrated an uneven radial arrangement, where red horizontal branch stars were more concentrated than the blue ones, a standard trend for many Local Group dwarf spheroidal galaxies. Additionally, the RGB stars showed greater color dispersion at the core in contrast to the periphery. With the help of subgiant branch stars, we also estimated that primary star formation had taken place ~8 Gyr ago, though there was a younger stellar population present at the center, which was not found in the outskirts."}
{"text":"\nThis study proposes that dark matter and dark energy can be identified as negative matter in the form of the Dirac negative energy state. This negative matter has special characteristics, such as an attraction to one another but a repulsion from all positive matter, and it is invisible. Its existence could explain some of the properties of dark matter and dark energy, including phantom. It is proposed that in quantum fluctuations, both positive and negative matter are created concurrently, resulting in an inflation cosmos that appears out of nothing. Moreover, the Higgs mechanism may be a product of both positive and negative matter. Subsequently, the authors explore the potential predictions and possible theoretical tests of this concept, particularly the season effect. Furthermore, the three basic laws of negative matter are proposed, with the premise that the presence of positive, opposite, negative, and negative-opposite particles create the most symmetrical world."}
{"text":"\nIn this work, we look into the virtual implications of unparticle physics on lepton flavor violation observed in processes such as $M^0\\to l^+l'^-$ and $e^+e^-\\to l^+l'^-$, where $M^0$ may refer to $\\pi^0$, $K_L$, $D_0$, $B_0$, or $B_s^0$ mesons and $l$, $l'$ denote two distinct lepton flavors. The present upper limits for the vector unparticle coupling for $B^0 \\to l^+l'^-$ decay are not violated. On the other hand, the constraint on the scalar unparticle field-leptons coupling is contingent upon the scaling dimension $d_{\\cal U}$. For $e^-e^+ \\to l^-l'^+$ scattering, bounding only exists for vector unparticle coupling with leptons, while scalar unparticle remains unconstrained. Additionally, we analyze and discuss the implications of scaling dimension $d_{\\cal U}$ variance on the center-of-mass energy dependence of cross-section $\\frac{1}{\\sigma}\\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\sqrt s}$ of $e^+e^-$ to $l^+l'^-$ scattering. Particular attention is paid to the case of $d_{\\cal U}=1.5$ in which the cross-section attains counter-intuitively steady state over varied center-of-mass energy and to $d_{\\cal U}>1.5$ in which the cross-section increases with $\\sqrt s$."}
{"text":"\nThe internal shock scenario of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) is explored in the context of their prompt emission in the GeV-TeV ranges. Monte Carlo simulations that take into account electrons, protons and muons accelerated to high energy levels are carried out. Our study demonstrates that inverse Compton scattering from primary electrons is often the dominant mechanism of gamma-ray emission in the GeV-TeV wavelength range. However, various proton-induced processes such as synchrotron emission from protons, muons or secondary electrons\/positrons resulting from photomeson interactions can also create distinct high-energy components that display double spectral breaks which can be used to identify the presence of ultra-high-energy protons. The conditions that can lead to such emission and how they are associated with the production of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays and neutrinos are discussed. The outlook of further observations by the {\\it GLAST}, Cerenkov telescopes and other facilities will verify our expectations and give insights into the physical phenomena inside GRB outflows."}
{"text":"\nThis study examines the metabolic energy consumption of different parts of the brain and its relation to the brain's volume in mammalian species. It was found that irrespective of the heterogeneity of energy consumption, the brain structures exhibit almost identical volume-specific metabolic rates viz. a scaling exponent of close to -0.15. On the other hand, the white matter seems to be the exception which shows a standard scaling exponent equal to -1\/4. Furthermore, the overall brain metabolism scales with a total exponent of 0.86\u00b10.03 in relation to its volume. This exponent is significantly greater than the standard Kleiber's exponent of 3\/4 as suggested for whole body basal metabolism. Besides providing insights into dietary requirements for optimal brain functioning of different species, the findings discussed here might pave the way for understanding the interplay between brain metabolic scaling and computation."}
{"text":"\nThis article investigates the frequency shifts observed in the g-mode spectrum when a central magnetic field and solar rotation are present. These corrections are computed in a one-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) model, with the model allowing analytical spectra of magneto-gravity waves to be found beyond the limitations of the JWKB approximation and deterring cusp resonance. These analytical results are compared with the frequency changes of g-modes, which comprise a 1% shift, from the data from the GOLF mission at the SoHO satellite. It is concluded that the main contribution to this alteration can be attributed to the magnetic frequency shift of a constant magnetic field intensity of 700 KG, with respect to the radial order of n = -10. The Coriolis force due to the rotational effects is set to be minor and not surpass 0.003."}
{"text":"This article explores the Stueckelberg extension of the Standard Model and MSSM, which includes an axion connecting the Standard Model and Stueckelberg sectors when combined with the usual Higgs mechanism. As a result, an extra $Z'$ boson is created with interactions that are a fraction weaker than the Standard Model's, yet of regular electro-weak strength with hidden sector matter. It is demonstrated how this structure can satisfy WMAP-3 constraints and lead to two distinct dark matter forms: milli weak and milli charged. Furthermore, this could arise as the field point limit of certain Type IIB orientifold string models."}
{"text":"\nThrough the use of XMM-Newton observations, we have studied the eclipsing polar V2301 Oph over two binary orbital cycles, revealing a unique 'standstill' feature in the X-ray eclipse profile that places a hard upper limit on the white dwarf's mass of approximately 1.2 Msun. No Quasi-Periodic Oscillations (QPOs) were detected in the frequency range of 0.02-10 Hz, suggesting that if present, oscillations in the shock front have minimal impacts on X-ray flux. Additionally, we have determined that the polar does not exhibit a distinct soft X-ray component, which is characteristic of seven other similar systems. Our observations indicate that when the specific mass transfer rate is close to 0.1 g cm^-2 s^-1, the mass derived from our eclipse analysis is consistent with the mass limit given by the X-ray eclipse profile. We suspect this is due to the relatively low magnetic field strength of the polar allowing for accretion to take place over a broader range of angles."}
{"text":"\nWe analyze the dust temperatures of prestellar cores in the rho Oph main cloud, and other star forming regions, by considering the 3D geometry of the area and external heating from nearby stars. Our results suggest that the cores in the rho Oph main cloud are colder than previously assumed, and have a corresponding shift in core mass function (CMF) from a slope of 1.5 to 2.5 at a mass of 1 Msun instead of 0.5 Msun. Moreover, our generalizations indicate that in Taurus, the cores are likely colder (> 10-11 K) than the average interstellar radiation field, while in Orion the dust temperatures are higher (20-30 K) due to faster external heating."}
{"text":"\nWe investigated the previously unstudied variable star V2104 Cygni using two different frequency analysis methods to detect and interpret its intrinsic frequencies. We obtained 679 datapoints with the uvbybeta photometers of the Sierra Nevada and San Pedro Martir Observatories, as well as a few spectra with the ELODIE and FIES instruments. We employed a S\/N>4 criterion to identify significant periodicities, which revealed 3 independent frequencies of amplitudes lower than 0.01mag. Our findings have led us to estimate the underlying B star spectral type between B5 and B7, via corrections to the strength of the Halpha line emission in the presence of a circumstellar disk. The star's rapid rotation of up to 290 +\/- 10 km\/s (27 < i < 45) has prevented us from examining its associated pulsational parameters. The most plausible explanation for the detected variability of this mid-late type Be star is a non-radial pulsation model. Supporting data for this study were acquired from the San Pedro Martir, Sierra Nevada, and Haute Provence Observatories, as well as the Nordic Optical Telescope, and Observatorio Roque de los Muchachos, in La Palma, Spain."}

This finding can be used to investigate the inner parts of the blazar jets as well as the extragalactic background light (EBL) in the near-infrared band. During the observation period of 2004 and 2005, H.E.S.S. detected 649 photons with a significance of 10 sigma.

Also found was the lack of notable flux variation on any time scale and a very hard spectrum. Lastly, 1ES 1101-232 has the highest confirmed redshift detected in VHE gamma-rays so far, at z = 0.186. Simultaneous spectral energy distributions were constructed of the source, from the optical to the VHE band, using an EBL model with a peak of 3 TeV."}
{"text":"\nAn IRAM 30m investigation of the incredibly bright, heavily obscured NGC4418 galaxy unveils a wealth of molecular species - HC3N, 2-1 and 3-2 ortho-H2CO, CN 1-0 and 2-1, HCO+, 1-0, 3-2, HCN 3-2 and HNC 1-0, 3-2 - fit with modest gas densities of n=5 x 10E4 - 10E5 cm-3 and temperatures of 80-150 K. Shocking though is the stronger than expected HCN and HNC emissions, attributed to a more high-density environment or to mid-IR radiation emission. The HCN lines are found to be weaker in the 3-2 transition than those of HCO+ and HNC, distinct from other observations of the 1-0 lines. The molecular line emission is thought to mirror a young, starburst medium with embedded active PDR regions, where X-ray chemistry is ruled out. A deeply hidden AGN could explain the emission, yet its impact on the molecular medium is assumed to be mild. It is determined that further study of HC3N abundance through XDRs, as well as deeper exploration of radiative excitation, is necessary."}
{"text":"We analyze the hydrodynamic flow of spins in a class of condensed matter systems where spin-orbit coupling is present. In this context, we are able to apply a language similar to that of Jackiw et al for a non-Abelian non-coherent 'classical' and macroscopic non-Abelian quantum entanglement. We give examples of spin transport phenomena in semiconductor spintronics, where we show that the the non-Abelian structure renders Aharonov-Casher effect more fragile than the Aharonov-Bohm effect. Additionally, we make the observation that when an order parameter is single-valued, hydrodynamics is restored. This restoration of hydrodynamics allows us to further explore the notion of line charge trapping in fixed frames, analogous to magnetic flux trapping in superconductors."}
{"text":"\nThe CDF collaboration has presented results of their searches for single-top quark production from a data set having an integrated luminosity of 955 pb^-1. Three distinct analysis methods (likelihood discriminants, neural networks and matrix elements) were employed and demonstrated sensitivities to single-top production which ranges from 2.1 to 2.6 sigma. The first two methods perceived a shortage of single-top events in comparison to expectations but the matrix element analysis identified a surplus representing a background irregularity of 2.3 sigma. Upper limits on the cross section of 2.6 pb and 3.7 pb were put in place for the t-channel and s-channel single-top production modes respectively at the 95% C.L. The matrix element consequence represented a determination of 2.7^+1.5_-1.3 pb for the consolidated t- and s-channel single-top cross section. Besides, CDF likewise sought non-standard model generation of single-top quarks via the s-channel transfer of a hefty W^\\prime particle. No proof of this process was observed, leading to lower mass constraints of 760 GeV\/c^2 and 790 GeV\/c^2 in case the mass of the right-handed neutrino is lower than the mass of the right-handed W^\\prime, or the other way around, respectively."}

The assumption here is that the image of the momentum map is comprised of strongly elliptic elements, which is equivalent to the assumption that $M = G \\times_K N$ for a compact Hamiltonian $K$-manifold $N$. Our proof is achieved via a reduction to the compact case, making use of the 'quantisation commutes with induction' principle, which is based on a version of the naturality of the assembly map for the inclusion of $K$ into $G$. This result is an extension of the Guillemin-Sternberg conjecture for $\\Spin^c$-groups."}
{"text":"This paper proposes a unified dynamical framework to explain the formation of both spiral arms and rings within barred galaxies. A bar potential in the rotating galactic system induces orbital motion within the equilibrium points, creating manifolds of invariant periodic orbits around the points. We discuss the parameter space indicated by three barred galaxy models, and review the way these parameters shape the formation of relevant morphological features. Additionally, we assess the importance of the shape of the rotation curve in the outer parts by developing models with varying rotation curves. Our results show that the differing spiral and ringed structures arise from the varying dynamical parameters of the host galaxies. We anticipate the comparison of our findings with observational evidence in an upcoming article."}
{"text":"\nThe CATS database (web-server http:\/\/cats.sao.ru) allows users to search through hundreds of catalogs filled with astronomical objects detected within the electromagnetic spectrum. This article outlines the current status of the database, with an emphasis on radio continuum source catalogs spanning 30-15000 MHz. CATS also contains radio and active stars, planetary nebulae, HII regions, supernova remnants, pulsars, nearby galaxies, active galactic nuclei, and quasars catalogs. In addition, the database accesses the most prominent extragalactic surveys, such as NVSS, FIRST, WENSS, VLSS, TXS, GB6, SUMSS, IRAS, 2MASS, SDSS, ROSAT, PGC, and MCG. As of 2004, the CATS database included approximately one billion records from over 400 catalogs in the radio, IR, optical, and X-ray windows, such as those from RATAN--600. With new and old catalogs being added or created in electronic form for the first time, this paper explains the organization of the CATS database and the main functions of CATS."}
{"text":"\nWe analyze the disk around the young star IRS 48 situated in the Ophiuchus cloud complex, making use of mid-infrared imagery from VISIR and taking into account the spectral type and Halpha line strength of the central star. Our findings reveal a ring-like structure 18.7 microns in diameter with a gap of approximately 60 AU, suggesting that the inner disk is depleted of small dust yet a PAH population persists. We infer that this may represent an intermediate stage from a classical to a weak-line T Tauri star, and the gap might be the result of grain growth and settling or planetary or low-mass companion clearance."}
{"text":"\nIn this paper, we investigate a general $SU(2)_L\\times SU(2)_R \\times U(1)_{EM}$ sigma model with external sources, dynamical breaking and spontaneous vacuum symmetry breaking. Using a general Lorentz transformation relative to external sources, we derive the relations between the four-dimensional currents of nuclear matter systems with and without external sources. We demonstrate the coupling of the densities and an external magnetic field, with results that conform to the phenomena of dense nuclear matter in a strong magnetic field. Furthermore, we discuss multiple condensates in strong interactions between fermions and antifermions, with concrete expressions for the scalar and pseudoscalar particles $\\sigma_0$ and $\\pi_0$. Comparing different dynamical breaking and vacuum symmetry breaking values leads to explicit expressions for the mass spectra in field theory. We gain insight into the running spontaneous vacuum breaking value $\\sigma_0^{\\prime}$, developing a method for inducing effective masses for nucleons, $\\sigma$ and $\\pi$ particles. We observe the effect of external sources and the formation of nonvanishing values for scalar and pseudoscalar particles. Finally, we observe variation in the masses of nucleons, $\\sigma$ and $\\pi$ dependent on different external sources."}
{"text":"\nThe aim of this article is to explore the nature of sources in the XBS survey which appear to be dominated by light from the host galaxy, with no visible indication of the presence of an active galactic nucleus (AGN). By conducting X-ray spectral analysis, we are able to detect AGN activity in 33 of the 35 sources, with both low (L[2-10keV]<10^41 erg s^-1) and high X-ray luminosities (L[2-10keV]>10^44 erg s^-1). We find that, particularly in the low-luminosity regime, AGN may be difficult to spot, with around 60% found to be elusive. This issue appears to be more crucial in absorbed AGN, but even a significant amount of unabsorbed AGN cannot be recognized. The two main reasons we believe for these AGNs being elusive are low AGN\/galaxy contrast (optical dilution) for low-luminosities and optical absorption for high-luminosities. However, there could be some outliers such as Compton-thick sources, BL Lac objects, and non-standard AGN that deserve further exploration."}
{"text":"\nWe examine the effects of attraction and repulsion strength and packing fraction on the visco-elastic characteristics of a model of steric repulsive and short-range attractive colloidal suspensions. Alongst this investigation, we observe a power-law divergence of the viscosity on approaching the glass lines, exhibiting the same exponent and critical packing fraction similar to those observed in density fluctuations. Through mode-coupling calculations, we associate the increase of the viscosity with distinct length-scale contributions. Specifically, we calculate the Stokes-Einstein relation for both repulsive and attractive glass transitions, displaying a drastic breakdown for the latter especially. To validate effectiveness, we contrast newtonian and brownian dynamics simulations."}
{"text":"\nThis paper details a method of pulsed laser ablation deposition utilized to construct an alternating layer thickness of granular Iron and Titanium dioxide on a Lanthanum aluminate substrate, yielding a total thickness of approximately 200 nm. Upon analysis, the composed film structure was classified as a p-type magnetic semiconductor at 300 K, demonstrating ferromagnetic behaviour from 4 to 400 K, and with a carrier density of 10$^{20}$\/cm$^3$. The undoped Titanium dioxide film showed characteristics of an n-type magnetic semiconductor. The holes present at the interface between the Iron and Titanium dioxide layers reacted to an applied magnetic field, implying the potential for spintronic applications."}
{"text":"\nIn this article, a non-relativistic limit of the Einstein equation is derived in stationary and stationary axially symmetric space-time. Absolute space and time are introduced, and the space at different moments is described by the surfaces $t=\\con $. The space-time metric is then expressed in terms of the 3D metric, plus two potentials: Newton's potential $\\Phi$ and a vector potential $\\vec A$ distinct from that in classical electromagnetism. Further calculations lead to a system of equations for the potentials, with left side containing the Laplacian of the Newtonian potential, derivatives of the vector potential and curvature of the space, and the right side containing terms of 3D stress tensor and mass-energy densities.

{"text":"\nOH (1720 MHz) and methanol masers provide insight into the processes of massive star formation. To further comprehend what is happening in the nuclear disk of our galaxy, we used these two types of masers along with infrared observatory data to examine active sites of star formation. The data revealed that gas temperatures in the massive molecular clouds of the nuclear disk are higher than their dust temperatures. There is a correlation between methanol masers and intensely embedded young stellar objects with strong emission at 4.5 microns. The position of methanol masers and supernova remnants illustrates a low efficiency of star formation, likely due to increased cosmic ray exposure in the nuclear disk. We venture to contend that cosmic rays heat the molecular clouds, raising their temperatures."}
{"text":"\nIn this article, we are searching for Galactic Cosmic Ray (GCR) sources in the form of PeVatrons, which accelerate particles to 10^15 eV and beyond. It has been predicted that supernova remnants are potential powerful accelerators of cosmic rays, based on the HESS detections of associated TeV gamma-rays. Diffusive shock acceleration allows the gradual injection of particles of various energies into the interstellar medium, primarily during the Sedov phase of the remnant evolution. In this phase, the spectrum of nonthermal particles can reach up to PeV energies. Thus, the detection of multi-TeV gamma-rays and neutrinos with energies over 10 TeV is an indication of a supernova remnant with an age of less than 1000 yr. In addition, if amassive gas cloud happens to be near the supernova remnant, the ``delayed''multi-TeV signals of gamma-rays and neutrinos may be seen at later times due to more energetic particles released from the shell reaching the cloud. This would enable us to indirectly track the PeVatron source."}
{"text":"\nWe explore the potential for the generation of vortices in axion condensates on galactic scales and analyse the associated rotation curves of model galaxies. We find that when suitable configurations are assumed, the curves resemble observational results fairly closely. In order for a single vortex to form on galactic scales, the velocity dispersion of the axions must be incredibly low, on the order of $\\sigma\\approx 10^{-12} \\frac{m}{s}$, which is far lower than the current theories of axion physics suggest. Alternatively, if the axion-like particle has a mass of $10^{-30}$eV, its de Broglie wavelength may be comparable to the galactic diameter, allowing its condensate to remain coherent on the galactic scale. This result could provide the impetus for galaxy formation and impart angular momentum."}
{"text":"\nThe VIMOS VLT Deep Survey has been used to study the assembly of galaxy stellar mass over the last 8Gyr. By selecting a mass-limited sample of 4048 objects from the survey in the 0.5<z<1.3 redshift interval, we used the intensity of the 4000 Balmer break (Dn4000) and the EW[OII]3727 line strength to examine the level at which stellar mass influences galaxy evolution. For the first time, we were able to document the relationship between stellar age and stellar mass through cosmic time. We discovered that low-mass galaxies have low Dn4000 values, while higher mass galaxies have higher Dn4000 values, similar to the local Universe. This spectral transformation, which began at an early epoch, is still ongoing and we can observe a growing number of ET systems with increasing stellar masses and the decrease of LT systems. Our stellar mass function shows the same gradual evolutionary pattern, with LT galaxies displaying no evidence of age change. The star formation indicators point towards a past-peaked star formation history in the more massive galaxies, with few or no star forming at present. In conclusion, the star formation and mass assembly is mass dependent, becoming less efficient in massive objects as time passes, resulting in the concept of star and mass assembly downsizing."}
{"text":"\nThe Spitzer IRS 5.5 - 35 micron spectroscopy of the debris disk around beta Pictoris was obtained. Silicate emission bands at 28 and 33.5 microns were detected in addition to 10 micron emission originally seen from the ground. The dust emission was explained by a model of fluffy cometary and crystalline olivine aggregates. Searches revealed no molecular hydrogen or Si II, Fe II and atomic [S I] gas, suggesting a mass of less than 17 Earth masses, which is less than the amount needed to form a Jupiter-like envelope. The possibility of atomic Na I gas around beta Pictoris being created by photon-stimulated desorption of dust grains was put forward."}
{"text":"\nThis article examines the concept of using spectrum pooling to achieve improved spectral efficiency in multiband\/wideband systems via the utilization of cognitive radio. We assume that primary and cognitive users are attempting to reach different receivers, while being aware of interference and their channel condition. The goal of this study is to assess the peak performance of a spectrum pooling system due to its simplicity. We impose the constraint that users transmit over available bands through selfish water filling algorithms. Our research has determined the asymptotic gain in spectral efficiency achieved through this technique, and also will quantify the total spectral efficiency as well as the number of potential pairwise cognitive communications that can be established."}
{"text":"\nThe properties of homopolymers when exposed to external force are of tremendous importance. To provide deeper insight, we have studied this using theoretical and computational approaches. Our results show that increasing the number of monomers, $N$, beyond a certain value, along with appropriate solvent conditions, allows for extension to follow a scaling of $<Z>\\sim f$ and $<Z>\\sim f^{{2\/3}}$, respectively, for small and intermediate values of force ($f$). Corresponding to these regimes, simulations from N=100 to 1600 showcase excellent agreement which however, does not interpret for lower N. {{We predict, however, that the scaling behaviour should be firmly established for $N\\gtrsim 10^5$ in good solvent conditions.}} Moreover, the force-dependent structure factors for poor solvents exhibit a hierarchical arrangement of structures upon varying the force -- from ideal conformations, globules to rod-like structures. Hints of a first order transition from globular to rod-like structures can be experienced when the force is greater than its critical value $f_c$. Our findings may potentially be verified experimentally."}
{"text":"\nThis study further expands our algorithmic model of the Wu-Sprung potential to the first 300 Riemann zeros. This analytic model merges the alternating-sign sine series fractal of Berry and Lewis A(x,g) with a smooth part of the potential, where the fractal dimension is set at 3\/2 and the frequency and scaling parameters are estimated. A two-dimensional random sample search is conducted over the rectangle 0<s<3 and 0<g<25 to calculate the set of parameters that optimally fit the lowest 300 eigenvalues to the first 300 Riemann zeros. The modification of adding the fractal model only produces a mildly better fit compared to the Wu-Sprung potential without the fractal model. Improvemet in fit concentrates in two distinct subdomains."}
{"text":"Here we present findings relevant to two-photon transitions in hydrogen atoms, as these processes can profoundly affect the dynamics of cosmological recombination. We explore transitions ns --> 1s and nd --> 1s up to high n and devise fitting formulae to describe their non-resonant parts. Combining these formulae with an analytic description of the cascade effect produces a simple yet accurate estimation of the full two-photon decay spectrum. We discuss the interference between the resonant and non-resonant terms, and their effects on the profiles' shape. We then develop a theoretical framework to understand the influence of the two-photon transitions on the cosmological hydrogen ionization history. We find that two-photon corrections for shells n>2 do not lead to a substantial change in total electron abundance, coming out to a moderate -0.4%  at redshift = 1160, which is comparable to the findings of prior research."}
{"text":"\nThis study examines the capacity of large-scale radial velocity surveys to assess theoretical models of Type II migration and associated protoplanetary disk physics. An analytic formulation of migration is blended with an empirically calibrated disk model containing viscous evolution and photoevaporation to gauge the likely radial arrangement of exoplanets. Analyzing a sample of exoplanets from three different planet search projects, we find that a simple model involving formation of planets in the outer disk, inward migration according to a Type II process, and subsequent suspension of migration when the gas disk dissipates, agrees with the radial placement of planets in the 0.1 to 2.5 AU range, featuring masses at or above 1.65 Jupiter masses. Several other variants do not match the data with equivalent assurance (roughly 95%), owing to the moderate sample size. Our favored model augurs that the planet mass function should stay steady with orbital radius in areas where migration predominates. Plus, the radial distribution can be used to gauge changes in the power-law index of the disk viscosity, and alterations in the efficiency of angular momentum transport near small radii."}
{"text":"\nThe ATLAS experiment was examined to determine its degree of sensitivity to any possible Wtb anomalous couplings found in top quark decays in the semi-leptonic processes of pp -> t tbar -> W+ b W- bbar, where one of the W bosons decay is leptonic and the other hadronic. Various measurements, such as the W helicity fractions and newly introduced ratios of helicity fractions and angular asymmetries in the W rest frame, have been analyzed to assess their dependence on such anomalous couplings. It has been found that certain observables have smaller systematic uncertainties than the helicity fractions, and also effectively identify a dependence on anomalous couplings that is either similar to or above that of the helicity fractions. Through these measurements, meaningful limits can be placed on these anomalous couplings. If these measurements are combined, the resulting precision in determining the presence of Wtb anomalous couplings can be within a few percent in the semi-leptonic channel alone."}
{"text":"\nThis study examines the limitations of using the redshift distribution of galaxy lenses in gravitational lens systems as a tool to learn more about cosmology and galaxy evolution. We evaluate ways to discern the properties of evolving galaxies, taking into account realistic cosmological models. Additionally, a new nested Monte Carlo method is proposed to address any missing data that could arise from incomplete information. Applying the lens-redshift test to an improved collection of 70 lens systems, mostly from the SDSS, SLACS, and the CLASS surveys, suggests that limitations stem from a lack of statistics, including incomplete data samples and biased sampling. Acquiring more lenses to uniformly sample the true image separation distribution is a key part of using this test for measuring cosmological constants and evolving galaxies. Anticipated future surveys from satellites like SNAP and LSST are likely to provide enormous amounts of strong lenses, making the lens-redshift test a more viable way to explore cosmology and galaxy evolution."}
{"text":"\nWe utilize 3D smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations in a realistic cosmological setting to learn about the expansion, feedback, and metal enrichment properties of a 200 M_Sun pair-instability supernova at high redshift. After propagating for a Hubble time at z = 20, we observe that the mean shock radius reaches a size of 2.5 kpc (proper), half the size of the associated HII region. As the shock escapes the host halo, it sweeps up a total gas mass of 2.5*10^5 M_sun, while becoming more anisotropic in form. In addition, the SN suppresses any potential star formation in the host halo for at least 200 Myr and exerts a positive mechanical influence on its neighboring minihalos. Nonetheless, due to prior photoheating from the progenitor star, we do not see any secondary star formation within the dense shell. Metal line cooling does not play a role in the SN's evolution, however the metal-enriched bubble eventually expands into the cavities created by the shock, as well as into the inter-galactic voids. We can thus conclude that minihalos with a minimum virial mass of 10^8 M_Sun are required for the effective recollecting of all swept-up gas parts."}
{"text":"This study examines a semi-analytical model for the formation of an equatorial disk and bipolar lobes in a rotating surface explosion. We propose a theory that builds on Bjorkman and Cassinelli's wind-compressed disk model, but amends it in order to account for a rotational distortion of the star, an explosion, and different dynamic techniques. We suggest that this model can generally be applied to LBVs, B[e] stars and SN1987A, and that in the absence of near-Eddington radiative driving, it can create bipolar morphologies without disks, similar to many PNes."}
{"text":"\nIn this paper, the global properties of the Carina Nebula are examined by measuring its total IR luminosity, ionizing photon luminosity, and the characteristics of star formation in the surrounding region. We find that the observed IR luminosity accounts for only half to two-thirds of the stellar luminosity input previously measured. It supports the idea of synchronous star formation directly triggered by stellar wind and UV radiation. Furthermore, calculations suggest that the massive star formation could be rekindled in the region when the famous Eta Carinae and its companions explode, providing a connection to the environment of the Solar System during its initial formation."}
{"text":"In this article, the discovery of two unique circumstellar rings in the western Carina Nebula is reported. These rings, labelled SBW1 and SBW2, differ in composition and age and encircle stars of different mass. Further examination of these two discoveries alongside a sample of other well-known rings reveals two categories: those around hot supergiants, and those around evolved intermediate mass stars in binary systems. The relationship between B[e] supergiants and the former group, as well as the possibility of thousands more dark rings in the Milky Way, is suggested. Finally, the possible connection between these rings and the equatorial density enhancements often invoked to bind the waists of bipolar planetary nebulae is discussed."}
{"text":"\nIn this study, we present an examination of the X-ray properties of 59 optically luminous quasars, ranging in redshift from 1.5 to 4.5. Utilizing Chandra, ROSAT, and XMM-Newton data, we compile the largest X-ray dataset of such luminous quasars to date. Our results indicate a mean power-law photon index of Gamma=1.92 and no significant absorption by neutral material. We observe a mean X-ray-to-optical spectral slope of a_ox=-1.80 and no trend in a_ox over redshift. Additionally, we conduct a discussion of a few noteworthy quasars that stand out from the results."}
{"text":"\nThis paper examines the utilization of the nonlinear steepest descent method for rank-two systems in the context of generalized orthogonal polynomials with regard to varying complex weights. By recasting the requirement for the Cauchy-transform of the equilibrium measure into a problem of algebraic geometry and harmonic analysis, a solution for the issue of existence and uniqueness is presented with the elimination of a minimization problem. In addition, this also tackles and solves the issue of the \"free boundary problem\" to discern implicit curves for the zeroes of orthogonal polynomials to accumulate in larger degrees and the support of the measure. Lastly, the relevance of the quasi-linear Stokes phenomenon for Painleve equations is outlined, and a numerical algorithm is provided to locate the curves in some cases. Technical instructions are provided for viewing the associated animations."}
{"text":"\nWe explore the progression of protoplanetary disks orbiting a millisecond pulsar system - PSR 1257+12 - by simulating how they can develop with two separate models on disk viscous evolution. The disk model used as initial conditions was constructed to reflect the supernova-fallback or the tidal disruption of a companion star. Results show that the supernova-fallback disk remains confined close to 1-2 AU and so can produce sufficient material to develop the three planets known to orbit PSR 1257+12. Additionally, tidal disruption disks are seen to under-produce the required material within 1 AU and to overly-produce material beyond this boundary. Conversely, disks progressing under 'layered' accretion spread less, as well as depositing higher concentrations of solids. In all models, the disk of gas dissipates on time frames of $\\lesssim 10^{5}$ years, conclusively ruling out the formation of gas giant planets."}
{"text":" The superspace approach in one dimension is applied to construct N=8 supersymmetric mechanics models for multiplets (b,8,8-b) classified in hep-th\/0406015, focusing on the previously unexplored cases of (8,8,0), (7,8,1) and (6,8,2), plus (5,8,3). The N=8 supersymmetry of the action is verified through a harmonicity condition of the Lagrangian to its superfield arguments. It is revealed that the bosonic target geometry is conformally flat, with a unique scalar potential apart from the 'root' multiplet. The N=4 superfield constraints demonstrate respect towards the full R-symmetry, with its quotient over the manifest R-symmetry found in terms of superfields and component fields. Several R-symmetric N=4 superfield Lagrangians with N=8 supersymmetry are uncovered, with a universal method that uncovers or reproduces them."}

{"text":"This paper reviews observational strategies for detecting planets in binary systems. Through such observations, we can better understand the influence of binary stars on the formation of planets. This study covers two types of planetary-binary configurations: S-type planets, in which a planet orbits one star in a binary, and P-type planets, where the planet orbits both stars. Techniques for finding S-type planets in both resolved and unresolved binaries are discussed, as are methods for finding P-type planets and planets in systems with closely aligned binary orbits. Ultimately, the review of these observational strategies aims to better explain which models of planet formation are more likely to be correct."}
{"text":"\nIn this article, a new technique is presented to measure the simultaneous detection probability of pixels and the spatial resolution of pixelized detectors by calculating statistical correlations between neighbouring pixel elements. The method was verified by testing it on images from two different GE Senographe 2000D mammographic units; both had been exposed to X-rays across the entire surface. It was found the pixel simultaneous detection probabilities could be estimated within an accuracy of 0.001-0.003 with a systematic error not exceeding 0.005. The presampled two-dimensional point-spread function (PSF0) was determined using a single Gaussian and a sum of two Gaussian approximations, the latter showing the best results. Its output indicated the probability of a large (about 50%) narrow scale component\u2019s existence. The sampled two-dimensional PSF was identified using Monte Carlo simulations with the help of an L-shaped uniform distributed acceptance function for various levels of fill factors. It was concluded the detector spatial resolution was 54 and 58 mkm for thetwo different units. It was discovered that while the presampled modulation transfer function was best reproduced using a single Gaussian approach, the sum of two Gaussians generated significantly larger values in the higher frequency region for both units."}

{"text":"This article explores how to estimate the spherical-harmonic power spectrum of an isotropic scalar signal from data on a region of the unit sphere. We present three different assessment techniques: (i) a spherical analogue of the one-dimensional (1-D) periodogram, (ii) the maximum likelihood method, and (iii) a spherical analogue of the 1-D multitaper technique. The periodogram exhibits strong spectral leakage with small area, $A\\ll 4\\pi$, making it unfit for spherical spectral analysis. On the other hand, the maximum likelihood method is best suited in large area, $A\\approx 4\\pi$, and is extensively implemented in the study of cosmic microwave background radiation. Lastly, the multitaper approach offers easy control of the fundamental balance between spectral resolution and variance, which makes it most suitable for applications in geophysics, geodesy, or planetary science, wherein the aim is to produce a localized estimate of the signal spectrum from noisy data within a pre-selected and usually small region."}
{"text":"\nThis article explores the magnetocaloric effect in the frustrated square lattice J1-J2 model. This model is used to explain the magnetic behavior of two classes of S = 1\/2 vanadates: Li2VOXO4 (X = Si, Ge) and AA'VO(PO4)2 (A, A' = Pb, Zn, Sr, Ba). Magnocaloric effect is a phenomenon in which the temperature changes adiabatically upon changing the external magnetic field strength. For frustrated systems, this effect can be especially prominent near to the saturation field because of the high level of degeneracy amongst low energy excitations. We used numerical finite temperature Lanczos as well as analytical spin wave expansion to investigate this model, with the results being used to calculate the saturation fields of the described compounds. Additionally, it was predicted that at subcritical fields, a positive maximum occurs prior to the sign change of the MCE - characteristic of magnetically ordered phases."}
{"text":"A study exploring the redshift-distance modulus relation, the Hubble Diagram, in the framework of Cosmological General Relativity has successfully extended the relation to higher redshifts, utilizing numerical methods to attain solutions to the field equations. The results have been examined against both supernova and Gamma-ray burst data, though the latter does not conform to the standard candle. Interestingly, the findings point to a universe whose spatial curvature is always flat with energy density determined by the cosmological constant and the matter density, both of which must always add up to the total density."}
{"text":"\nThis paper investigates how to effectively minimize the distortion associated with transmitting a Gaussian source over a slowly fading channel while accounting for the delay limitations. To achieve this, a superimposed layering approach is taken, with each layer refining the description of the source from the previous. The receiver then can decode layers supported by the channel realization. To obtain successful transmission and to reduce distortion, we look at optimally allocating the transmit power among the source layers. We prove that for two source layers, optimal power allocation consists of first assigning power to the higher layer up to a specific power ceiling, then, if needed, assigning the remaining power to the lower layer. Additionally, we find that in the case of convex distortion cost functions and convex constraints, minimizing expected distortion is formulated as a convex optimization problem. Furthermore, when the bandwidth ratio b tends to zero, the power distribution that minimizes expected distortion converges to the one that maximizes expected capacity. We also see that while expected distortion can be improved either from obtaining channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) or from channel diversity, at high SNR the performance gain from diversity will exceed that from CSIT, especially when b is large."}
{"text":"\nIn this study, we assess the role of planetesimal accretion in the formation of gaseous protoplanets. We outline a sequence of events wherein the transition from small planetary cores to fully-fledged protoplanets can be modulated by residual planetesimals. Evaluation of the mean motion resonances shows that planetesimals cannot pass through these structures, thereby allowing gas to be accreted with little disruption. However, as the protoplanet grows, the resonances overlap, creating an environment for planetesimals to become dynamically unstable. The ensuing gas drag resulting from this instability triggers the migration of planetesimals, which in turn produces a massive bombardment of the protoplanet's surface. Through this mechanism, we explain the discrepant core-envelope structures found in Jupiter and Saturn, as well as the metallic abnormality of many known transiting exoplanets."}
{"text":"\nInspired by the contributions of Salvetti and Settepanella, we illustrate an ordering technique of the faces in any shellable regular CW-complex (referred to as 'Shelling-type orderings'). The method allows us to  create maximum acyclic matchings of the totality of cells of the specified complex. Utilizing this technique, we  define a set of maximum acyclic matchings of the Salvetti complex of a linear complexified arrangement. To do this, we develop a new type of combinatorial stratification of the Salvetti complex. Through the selection of a linear extension of the poset of regions, we are able to present an explicit description of the critical cells solely based on the chambers of the arrangement and a no-broken-circuit set specified by Jewell and Orlik. Our approach can be extended to any type of oriented matroid."}
{"text":"\nThis study examines the impacts of the presence of a companion star on the process of planetesimal accretion. It focuses on analyzing the changes in the encounter velocities of the planetesimals. By utilizing numerical simulations to simulate the motions of the binary and incorporating the effects of gas friction in the disk, we are able to identify three different scenarios of accretion. When the increase in velocity is minimal relative to the erosion threshold velocity, classical single star accretion can occur. Where the relative fluctuations in velocity are above the erosion threshold, planet growth is halted. And between these two extremes are cases in which planetesimal growth can occur, but at a slower rate than that of single star cases, possibly following the type II runaway growth mode."}
{"text":"\nIn this article, two relativistic fluctuation theorems pertaining to entropy ds which is locally produced as a consequence of nonequilibrium physics and relativity theory are examined. The first theorem, <exp(-ds)>=1, is a generalization of the second law of thermodynamics with the capability to remain valid in the presence of relativistic particle energies and high cosmic expansion rates. Additionally, the special case of the Einstein-de Sitter universe offers an additional relation known as <exp(-ds-dh)>=1, where dh is proportional to the Hubble constant, which simultaneously holds with the first theorem. Furthermore, the fluctuation theorems risk providing an answer to a discretization dilemma arising from special-relativistic Brownian motion. Examples of these theorems as well as a method for computing non-Gaussian entropy fluctuations are also provided."}
{"text":"\nIn this work, we gathered spectroscopic data from 72 emission-line objects, primarily HII regions, in the spiral galaxy M 33. Such observations were taken by the multi-object, wide field spectrograph AF2\/WYFFOS at the 4.2m WHT telescope. Using these data and the available emission line fluxes, we derived electron temperature, chemical abundances, and the ionization correction factor (ICF) method to gauge the total chemical abundances. We inferred the presence of abundance gradients and found that the oxygen abundances in these HII regions, located in a radial range from ~2 to ~7.2 kpc, yielded a gradient of -0.054+\/-0.011 dex\/kpc. Additionally, the overall oxygen gradient for M 33 was determined as a two slope shape, of -0.19 dex\/kpc for the central regions (R<3kpc), and -0.038 dex\/kpc for the outer regions (R>=3kpc)."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate exclusive charmless B meson decays within the context of the Standard Model of particle physics. We focus on hadronic two-body decays such as B -> pi pi, analyzing the role of the heavy-to-light form factors required for semi-leptonic decays like B -> pi l nu. To explore the QCD dynamics present in such transitions, we consider non-relativistic bound state form factors to serve as a basis for our calculations. To ensure a complete analysis, we compute NNLO QCD corrections to the imaginary parts of topological tree amplitudes, as well as perform a partial calculation of the real part of the amplitudes. Furthermore, we assess NLO soft-overlap contributions, resulting in light-cone distribution amplitudes applicable to B_c or eta_c mesons. Our findings mend our understanding of direct CP asymmetries present in the strong interaction phases of these decays."}
{"text":"\nWe present the results of computer simulations and mean field theory which show that a two dimensional system of particles that has narrow confines between two parallel walls can have unique structural and mechanical features. The density of the system and the dimension of the gap between the walls plays a major role. The outcome of altering either of the variables can be a weakly modulated liquid, strongly modulated smectic, triangular solid or a buckled phase. Furthermore, depending on the size of the gap we observe abrupt changes in the number of layers adhered to the walls in a phenomenon of reentrant discontinuity. The solid element demonstrates an unusual property of naturally resisting an extension but not a shear. Though, pushing beyond its elastic limit brings about a plastic deformation yet strikingly, on its reverse the material regains its original condition. Our paper discusses the phase diagram derived from our research and its susceptibility to fluctuations."}
{"text":"\nBy analysing the frequencies of low-degree solar-oscillation modes measured using\nthe Birmingham Solar-Oscillations Network (BiSON) over a 4752 day period, we\nhave been able to constraint the mean molecular weight of the solar core and the\nsolar metallicity of the convection zone. Seismic results imply a high\nmetallicity value, and we found average mean molecular weight in the\ninner 20% by radius was between 0.7209 and 0.7231, all with very precise\nuncertainties. Our estimates, with their respective uncertainties, for solar\nmetallicity ranges from 0.0187 to 0.0239. We can now conclude that the\ndiscrepancies between solar models with low metallicity cannot be attributed to\ndeficiencies in the solar convection zone modelling."}
{"text":"\nWe present results from a 944-epoch survey of archival data from the Very Large Array taken over 22 years, featuring a single field of view with a full-width at half-maximum of 8.6' and 5.1' at 5 and 8.4 GHz, respectively. The point-source detection threshold at the beam center is approximately 300 microJy per epoch. Ten transient sources were discovered, most of which were only detected once - two were only detected in two-month averages. The cumulative rate of short timescale radio transients above 370 microJy at 5 and 8.4 GHz is 0.07 < R < 40 deg^-2 yr^-1. These transients were not found in any long-term averages or persistent emission in the image formed by all epochs. Two transients were associated with galaxies at redshifts 0.040 and 0.249 and may be similar to the peculiar Type Ib\/c radio supernova SN 1998bw associated with GRB 980428. The host and progenitor of the remaining six transients is as yet unknown."}
{"text":"\nThis work investigates the behaviour of the sine-Gordon equation as a model of magnetic flux propagation in Josephson junctions. Starting with natural initial conditions in the form of a moving $-2\\pi$ kink, we calculate the solution of the non-characteristic Cauchy problem exactly for arbitrarily small values of the dispersion parameter $\\e$. This produces a sequence of analytical solutions that are analogous to $N$-soliton solutions of the focusing nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation. Plots of the exact solution for small $\\e$ show certain features that emerge in the semiclassical limit, such as the emergence of nonlinear caustics as $\\epsilon\\to 0$. Appendices A and B explain the Cauchy problem from the perspectives of inverse scattering and classical analysis, providing a complete formulation of the inverse-scattering method for generic $L^1$-Sobolev initial data, and the well-posedness for $L^p$-Sobolev initial data."}
{"text":"\nInvestigations into the influence of stellar multiplicity on planet presence and characteristics have been marred by a lack of observational data. In an effort to bring observational evidence to this field, two programs utilizing adaptive optics imaging and radial-velocity monitoring have been initiated. In this chapter, the restructuring of the approach and the preliminary outcomes of these two projects are reported. Analysis of the findings from VLT\/NACO imaging survey offer the first individual proof that the existence of planets is lessened in binaries closer than ~120 AU. Additionally, on the radial-velocity side, recent results underscore the use of two-dimensional correlation to search for planets orbiting the primary star in various forms of spectroscopic binaries. The pursuing conclusion of the survey of planets in spectroscopic binaries is set to bring crucial information on the closest binaries capable of holding circumprimary giant planets."}
{"text":"This paper examines a cosmological brane-bulk model of exchange of energy between the two realms. We investigate the possibility of the model to offer a crossing of the phantom divide without introducing phantom energy, which has underlying quantum instabilities. Our research uses the seminal Gold06 SnIa dataset to provide an estimate of the preferred parameter values. We provide 3 different fitting approaches that propose the best fit parameters, and suggest that a bulk energy component is responsible for the energy flow to the brane, exhibiting a behaviour akin to relativistic matter that propagates in the bulk at a velocity v. The bulk-brane exchange component, meanwhile, indicates energy is transferred from the bulk to the brane, signifying negative pressure. Our findings illustrate the ability of such braneworld models to afford a natural crossing of the phantom divide line, while pointing to the relevant parameter values in agreement with current cosmic acceleration data."}
{"text":"We analyze the effects of gravitational instability in binary protoplanetary disks and the implications it has on giant planet formation. Through simulations conducted by three different groups with various methods, we observe variations in temperature and physical structure that result from interactions with the companion star. The outcomes of these results are inconclusive yet on whether or not interactions with a binary partner enhance or hinder giant planet formation. Computations suggest that binary systems with separations under 60 AU can offer substantial insight into the formation of giant planets. To further explore this, more precise comparison of computer models is necessary."}
{"text":"\nThis work provides an examination into the stability of a class of interconnected nonlinear systems which are inspired by biochemical reaction networks. By looking into the passivity properties of subsystems, the structure of the network, and the signs of the connections, a \"dissipativity matrix\" has been constructed to mark global asymptotic stability. This is an expansion of previous research on cyclic networks, allowing its use to extend further with networks of any graph. It also has the capacity to introduce state products, expanding its use to an even larger category of models. An illustrative example of a mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade model and metabolic network model have been used to showcase the applicability of the proposed stability test. The research is then rounded off by examining the stability of a compartmental system of identical systems under the consideration of diffusion terms."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate the para-(co)cyclicity of a (co)simplex Z^*=\\Pi T_l^{* +1} X over an object X in M involving two (co)monads T_l and T_r on a category M, with a distributive law. To determine this, we formulate the categorical version of Kaygun's axioms of a transposition map in terms of the natural transformation i:\\Pi T_l \\to \\Pi T_r, and a morphism w: T_r X \\to T_l X. We then focus on the example when T is a (co)module algebra or coring of an R-bialgebroid, comparing Z_* to a cyclic structure on T^{\\otimes_R *+1} \\otimes_B X. Subsequently, when T is a B-Galois extension, a stable anti Yetter-Drinfel'd B-module T_S is constructed, where the cyclic objects B^{\\otimes_R *+1} \\otimes_B T_S and T^{\\hat{\\otimes}_S *+1} are isomorphic. Finally, we apply this to compute (co)homology of a groupoid with coefficients, and obtain explicit expressions for ordinary Hochschild and cyclic homology of a groupoid."}
{"text":"This investigation studies the internal states of isotropic granular packings by way of numerical simulation. A comparison of numerical and experimental data reveals that frictionless systems tend to produce random close packing in the low pressure limit and friction-based packings yield similar densities with a coordination number of 4.5. Introducing the concepts of rattlers and floppy modes, it is observed that these packings possess a finite level of force indeterminacy, even when assembled slowly under low pressure, except in extreme circumstances of infinite friction."}
{"text":"\nThis article focuses on the wave function of photons and position eigenvectors. The quantum state vector has been projected onto a combination of the number operator and a photon position operator that couples spin and orbital angular momentum. A similarity transformation of a biorthogonal field-potential pair reveals a positive frequency solution of Maxwell's equations that is consistent with the established rules of quantum mechanics. We demonstrate a quantum picture of the optical angular momentum of beams in single-photon and coherent states and construct a wave function that gives the probability to locate a photon in any position in space."}
{"text":"\nIn this continuation of a three-part investigation of the geometric and mechanical implications of externally applied, isotropic stresses on spherical bead packings, the effects of these stresses--which varied from 1 or 10 kPa up to 100 MPa--on several configurations composed by varying methods were monitored. Changes in solid fraction, coordination number, rattler proportion, normal force distribution, friction mobilization level, and near neighbor distances were all taken into account. It was concluded that, although compression resulted in reversible solid fraction changes in absence of plasticity and damage, all other properties changed irreversibly due to frictional hysteresis. Low pressure states with high coordination numbers lost contacts during compression, and contained values similar to those of the worst-coordinated configurations. This shows that even minor changes in load could lead to notable alterations in contact networks of granular packings under quasistatic conditions."}
{"text":"\nThis paper provides a comprehensive exploration of the elastic properties of numerically simulated isotropic arrangements of spherical beads subjected to varying levels of confining pressure P. Analysis of the data reveals that while P affects the stiffness of the connections, the coordination numbers, which do not necessarily correspond to the density, have the greatest influence on the elastic moduli. Comparing the results to experiments done on glass beads in the 10kPa to 10MPa range revealed similar trends in dry samples with vibrations used for compaction and wet packings with their lower densities having larger coordination numbers and resulting in greater stiffness. Additionally, the research shows that the Voigt and Reuss bounds accurately bracket the bulk modulus, but are less reliable for the shear modulus. The elastic range also extends to small strain levels. The paper's conclusion presents implications for utilizing elastic moduli for understanding coordination numbers, as well as possibilities for further research."}
{"text":"\nThis work presents a study of the application of real-time renormalization group (RG) in the nonequilibrium conditions of a quantum dot in the Coulomb blockade regime. Using one-loop RG equations we examine self-consistently the kernel that governs the reduced density matrix of the dot. We observe that relaxation and dephasing rates affect the RG flow, which is further influenced by temperature, energy excitation, frequency, and voltage. Using the completely anisotropic Kondo model with an external magnetic field, we investigate the differential conductance as a function of bias voltage and comment on the distinct quantum phase transition that can be modified by altering the sign of the anisotropy parameters. Furthermore, the noise S(\\Omega) at finite frequency is calculated via the isotropic Kondo model, and it is revealed that the dephasing rate is decisive in determining the characteristics of the shoulders in dS(\\Omega)\/d \\Omega at \\Omega=V."}
{"text":"The current research explored the dust grain characteristics of Comet Hale-Bopp by utilizing the T-matrix method and a modified power law distribution function. Results showed that the observed data fit well with a power index ($\\alpha) = - 3$. The best-fit values of the complex refractive index $(n, k)$ and the aspect ratio (E) at $\\alpha = - 3$ were calculated to be $(1.382, 0.035, 0.936)$ and $(1.379, 0.041,0.936)$ at $\\lambda = 0.485 \\mu m$ and $0.684\\mu m$ respectively. Kerola & Larson (K-L) previously analysed the same comet using the T-matrix method and a power law distribution function ($\\alpha = -3$), verifying the ability of prolate grains to explain the observed polarization in a more satisfactory manner than other shapes. Though, their analysis could not reproduce the negative polarization branch beyond the scattering angle of $157^0$. The current study successfully generated the expected negative polarization curve beyond $157^0$ though, with a much better fitting than K-L's work. It can, thus, be concluded from this study that a modified power law distribution function (with $\\alpha = - 3$) offers a better fit for the observations than the power law distribution function employed by prior authors."}
{"text":"We have conducted a survey to identify and analyze dying radio sources in the local universe through the Westerbork Northern Sky Survey (WENSS) and the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS). By cross-correlating only sources with unresolved spectra and a 1.4 GHz flux density greater than 10 mJy, our search yielded eleven candidates. We used the Very Large Array (VLA) to confirm the steepness of their spectra and check levels of activity in flat-spectrum cores and radio jets. We found six instances of dying sources and three of restarted sources, while two candidates remain unresolved and possibly are Compact Steep Spectrum sources. Through spectral fitting, we determined the average active phase age to be between 10^7 - 10^8 years, much larger than the average relic phase age, which is about one order of magnitude shorter."}
{"text":"\nWe present a novel way to regularize the singularities derived from co-dimension two 4-branes in 6D gauged chiral supergravity compactified on axially symmetric internal spaces. This method involves capping the interiors of the branes with a 4D flat solution of the 6D field equations, a process which is always possible for any given bulk geometry. By breaking the scale invariance which connects the classical solutions to 6D supergravity, we show that these brane caps generically stabilize the size of the extra dimensions and calculate the resulting scalar potential in the 4D effective theory. This has the consequence of naturally implementing the Goldberger-Wise stabilization mechanism in six dimensions."}
{"text":"This article examines the performance of Stern-Volmer modeling when assessing Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between dilute, freely-diffusing membrane-bound fluorophores. Experiments are conducted to better understand the use of FRET when measuring the two metrics of acceptor-quenching of donor fluorescence, E, and donor-excited acceptor fluorescence, F-A-Dex. We discover a correlation between simple Stern-Volmer expressions and Wolber and Hudson's series approximation for steady-state Forster quenching in 2D, thus allowing us to interpret each quenching constant in terms of an effective Forster distance and two application-specific maximum acceptor-concentration limits. The findings provide a clearer understanding of how to design successful steady-state FRET experiments to study biomembranes."}
{"text":"This article reviews the diffusion of small probe particles through polymer\nsolutions, analyzing their relationship with solution viscosities. Exploring\nthe phenomenology of the diffusion of probe particles, it is found that the rate\nof diffusion is generally dependent on the polymer concentration, molecular\nweight and structure in a manner that cannot be reduced solely to the viscosity\nof the solution. Investigation shows that some systems have bi- or tri-modal\nspecs and may be characterized by a single, concentration-independent length\nscale. Additionally, rare re-entrant behaviors in a few systems are discussed,\nimplicating specific chemical effects. True microrheological measurements that\nmeasure the motion of mesoscopic particles under an external force are examined\nas well, concluding that the viscosity from microrheological measurements is\noften much lower than from macroscopic instruments."}
{"text":"\nWe present the discovery of two Jovian-mass planets orbiting a solar-like star: HD 155358. The planets, found with orbital periods of 195.0 and 530.3 days and eccentricities of 0.11 and 0.18 respectively, interact to influence each other's eccentricities and periastron passages in orbits lasting at least 10^8 years. This host star is remarkable for its record-low metallicity of -0.68, only 21% of the heavy-element content of our Sun. Despite the lack of heavy element content, the system still facilitated formation of at least two planets with semi-major axes at 0.6-1.2 AU."}
{"text":"This paper is concerned with the collection of integers that index the fixed points of maps on the space of rational functions. Specifically, given integers s and t, we characterize the set of integers that are distinguished with respect to (s,t). This set can be written as a union of infinitely many arithmetic progressions, and we use it to generate a set of rational functions that are fixed by the map phi_{s,t}. We discuss the relation of this generating set to a basis previously constructed for the space of rational functions fixed by phi_{s,t}."}
{"text":"\nThe current study assesses the confinement of cosmic rays (CR) in fossil cluster bubbles inflated by active galactic nuclei (AGN). We simulate the diffusion of CR particles within the bubble and find that for realistic magnetic field topologies, a substantial fraction of CRs can be confined and sustain the presence of radio ghosts. We also speculate that such confinement of CR could account for the presence of H$\\alpha$ filaments trailing behind the bubbles, permanently displace metal enriched material from the cluster center and provide an observable $\\gamma$-ray output from the interaction of the diffusing cosmic rays and the thermal intracluster medium (ICM)."}
{"text":"\nThe kinematics of the spiral arm streaming in M51 (NGC 5194) are investigated through velocity fields of CO and H alpha. Fitting a 2D velocity field extrapolates the radial and tangential velocity components over different spiral phases, revealing large radial and tangential streaming velocities in accordance with density wave theory and indicating the existence of shocks. The streaming motions indicate complexity across the galaxy, in both between and along arms. Aberrations in the velocity field suggest that the disk is not coplanar at least as close in as 800 pc to the center. The profiles of the H alpha and CO emission are similar, suggesting that the H alpha originates from regions of newly formed stars. The vortensity looses and mass flows are also examined, uncovering varying mass fluxes, which cannot be reconciled with a single global spiral mode. Thus, it is concluded that the spiral arms cannot be in a steady state or that out of plane motions may be particularly relevant."}
{"text":"We examine the effect of the electrons in our Milky Way on the variance in CMB temperature. Utilizing the data surrounding the free electrons' distribution, density, and movement in conjunction with the velocity of our Galaxy with regard to the Hubble flow, an effect known as the Kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich Effect appears in the cosmic microwave background. This effect does not vary between frequencies, and has an angular power spectrum with low power for even multipoles contrasted with the odd ones. We conclude that even though the atmospheric variance from this effect is minor (~ 2 uK), modeling its behavior could aid in the pursuit of more accurate measurements of the primordial signal."}
{"text":"\nThe build-up of large-scale radio telescopes to observe the cosmic distribution of atomic hydrogen, as represented by its 21-cm line, between redshifts 6-15 will provide a means to investigate ionization fluctuations during cosmic reionization. Given that noise and foreground emission may make it difficult to obtain detailed maps, a more suitable statistical tool is required to observe the associated brightness fluctuations. We propose the difference PDF of 21-cm fluctuations as a potential solution, a two-dimensional function that could help to measure the underlying ionizing sources. Our findings suggest that the PDF of the difference in 21-cm brightness temperature between two points could be used to separately assess the statistical properties of ionized regions, providing a deeper understanding of reionization than the standard correlation function."}
{"text":"This paper proposes a generalised ARCH model with long-term memory to capture and reproduce the time-dependent variance, volatility clustering and power-law probability density distribution of stochastic time series. The model also offers the ability to accurately reproduce the strong persistence of the instantaneous variance as shown by large values of the Hurst exponent and the asymptotic power-law decay of the absolute values self-correlation function. This is accomplished through the introduction of a single effective return parameter, $q_{m}$, obtained from the correlation of past returns with a q-exponential form. This model is applied in the context of the daily fluctuations of the SP500 financial index to assess its validity and usefulness."}
{"text":"\nThis article focuses on the effects of non-perturbative corrections and modular properties in four-dimensional type IIB Calabi-Yau orientifolds. It is found that certain alpha' corrections exist in the large volume limit of the orientifold and periodically modify the Kahler potential. These modifications depend on the NS-NS two form and should be supplemented with D-instanton contributions that are covariant with the type IIB orientifold background. Results suggests that D-instantons lead to a superpotential that is dependent on a two-form moduli and the complex dilaton. An application of a particular Enriques Calabi-Yau orientifold highlights these properties, whereby the resulting four-dimensional effective theory is free of quantum corrections. Furthermore, it has been proposed that the D-instanton superpotential is linked to a modular form that counts D3, D1, and D(-1) degeneracies on the given Calabi-Yau."}
{"text":"\nThe interaction between electrons and either phonons or other electrons has been proposed to explain the phenomenon of superconductivity in both graphene intercalation compounds and high-Tc cuprates. In the latter system, a Van Hove singularity (VHS) in the density of states near the Fermi level enhances the many-body couplings which could enhance superconductivity. With the topology of the graphene band structure comparable to that of the cuprates, a similar anisotropic variation in the coupling strength can be found, with an enhanced electron-phonon coupling near the saddle point in the graphene structure. This reinforces the idea that manipulation of the VHS with respect to the Fermi level may optimise the superconducting transition temperature (Tc) in superconducting layered materials."}
{"text":"\nWe conduct a study of the velocity field of non-binary Hipparcos stars via vector spherical harmonics, using a sample of 42,339 stars that have reliable parallaxes. We examine the relations between parameters of the well-known Ogorodnikov-Milne model of the local systemic field and low-degree terms of the general vector harmonic decomposition. Our findings indicate the solar velocity to be $(V_X,V_Y,V_Z)=(10.5, 18.5, 7.3)\\pm 0.1$ \\kms. Applying simple least-squares adjustment, we determine Oort's parameters to be $A=14.0\\pm 1.4$, $B=-13.1\\pm 1.2$, $K=1.1\\pm 1.8$, and $C=-2.9\\pm 1.4$ \\kmspc. We also notice a few statistically significant higher degree harmonic terms, with the most remarkable among them being a first-degree magnetic harmonic indicating a rigid rotation of stars in the opposite direction to the assumed direction of Galactic rotation. This harmonic has a coefficient of $6.2 \\pm 0.9$ \\kmspc and is seen in higher distance stars too. The vertical motion this produces contrary to the vector field expected from the stationary Galactic warp model."}
{"text":"\nWe study the age of the double pulsar system J0737-3039 based on the spin-down of the first-born 22.7-ms pulsar A and the 2.77-s pulsar B, whose characteristic ages are 210 and 50 Myr, respectively. Conventional models for dipolar spin-down of two pulsars suggest that B has only been around for ~50 Myr, close to its characteristic age. Nevertheless, we look into models that take into account the influence of A's relativistic wind on B's spin-down, which reveals that B could have been born 80 or 180 Myr ago depending on which interaction mechanism applies. An 80-Myr age would be closer to the characteristic age of B, while the 180-Myr age would match the recent estimates of coalescence rate. Furthermore, the new age limits have minimal impact on the estimates of kick velocity, pre-supernova mass of B's progenitor, and tilt angle between the pre- and post-supernova orbital planes."}
{"text":"\nThe contribution of double white dwarfs to the expected noise for LISA --- the gravitational wave foreground --- has been mainly studied using detached binaries, so far. This article investigates the potential of Roche-Lobe Overflow (RLOF) Galactic binaries on the strength and shape of this signal. Our research reveals that <1% of the remnant binaries in LISA frequency range are double white dwarfs, and the contribution of RLOF binaries to the foreground noise is almost insignificant at lower frequencies. However, at higher frequencies their input becomes considerable, leading to the frequency at which the noise level drops below the instrumental noise to be larger than 6 mHz. Additionally, we show that a sizable number of Galactic double white dwarf binaries have a signal-to-noise ratio >5 and may be resolvable using LISA. We also discuss the contribution of the formation channels to the LISA disc and bulge populations. The findings of this study are important for a comprehensive understanding of the LISA gravitational wave foreground."}
{"text":"\nIn this study, an improved version of the Cosmic Ray Acceleration SHock (CRASH) model has been used to investigate the progression of cosmic-ray (CR) affected quasi-parallel plane shocks. This new version entails an incorporated modeling of Alfven wave drift and dissipation, together with thermal leakage injection of CRs and further analysis of the CR distribution unto much higher energies than that of earlier studies. The results revealed that the pressure exerted by the postshock CR reaches a static state after a brief preliminary period of adjustment and the shock precursor expands incrementally over time, with no reliance on the diffusion model employed so long as CRs continue to be propelled up to higher energies. It was also established that the scale of the nonlinear shock structure can be familiarly represented in terms of the similarity variable (x\/(u_s t)), which is contingent on the shock speed and with the Mach number serving as the paramount determinant for shock development and acceleration efficiency. The velocity change created by Alfven wave drift and wave energy dissipation in the precursor, however, lessens the CR optimization noticeably."}
{"text":"\nThe thermal symmetry of the quantum Markovian master equation, which governs the reduced dynamics of a harmonic oscillator interacting with a thermal reservoir, is investigated in this work. The Bogoliubov transformation is utilised to uncover the presence of the symmetry, which is represented by a hyperbolic rotation applied to the Liouville space, an extension of the Hilbert space, which is attained by introducing certain tilde variables associated with thermofield dynamics. This symmetry permits connections to be drawn between the thermal states of the system at any two temperatures, including zero, at which point purely quantum effects manifest. It is also revealed that the symmetry is not specific to this system but is instead shared by the Caldeira-Leggett equation and the classical Fokker-Planck equation. The implications of this symmetry on the shape of a Gaussian wave packet is discussed."}
{"text":"\nWe have explored the conduction properties of various biphenyl-derived dithiol molecules attached to gold electrodes, to gain insight into the effects of modulation of the tilt angle (phi) and side groups on the conductance of the junctions. Our study found that the conductance decreases from a planar to a perpendicular configuration, with an influence of the side groups minimal to the zero temperature conductance. The variance of the conductance due to the temperature-induced geometrical changes can be reduced through careful design. This is generally consistent with experiments by Venkataraman et al. [Nature 442, 904 (2006)]. Our Density-Functional-Theory-based transport analysis provides detailed understanding of the tilt-angle dependence and temperature effects on the low-bias conductance of single-molecule junctions."}
{"text":"The helium abundance in galaxies and clusters cannot be measured directly, paving the way for a significant source of uncertainty in cosmological tests based on X-ray derived cluster quantities. We propose that this dependence on abundance can be used to measure the abundance with the help of the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect. Recent research indicates that the accuracy is within reach if one adopts the WMAP H_0 value. Additionally, we address the possibility of combining SZ and X-ray data in order to resolve the helium abundance dependence for the d_a(z) cosmological test."}
{"text":"We have conducted a long-term statistical analysis of variability in a large sample of Active Galactic\nNuclei (AGN) across multiple high radio frequencies. Our sample was composed of various AGN types (high and low polarization quasars, BL Lacertae objects and radio galaxies) and was gathered using the Metsahovi Radio Observatory's 22 GHz, 37 GHz and 87GHz monitoring data from the past 25 years, as well as the data obtained using the SEST-telescope between 1987 and 2003. We also used the University of Michigan monitoring program data at 4.8 GHz, 8 GHz and 14.5 GHz. Three different statistical methods (structure function, discrete correlation function and Lomb-Scargle periodogram) were applied in order to examine the flux density variations of AGN on short timescales, as well as the frequency and physical parameter differences regarding their variability. Results showed that 1-2 year short-timescale fluctuations occur more frequently compared to large outbursts, with an average of once every 6 years. Differing from the hypothesis, there were no significant differences between AGN types and the time scales appeared to be only weakly related to luminosity, suggesting that instability in the jet, rather than the black hole, may be the source of these shock formations."}
{"text":"\nMolecular dynamics simulations are used to study the composition and mechanical properties of a simplified two-dimensional model of a cohesive powder. The characteristics of the cohesive packaging depend on the particular procedure used for assembly, from denser structures when isolated particles are compressed to looser ones when large aggregates are combined prior to pressing. Essential in governing the behavior of the microstructure is the ratio of applied pressure acting on the grains of size $ a$ to the maximum tension of the contact force, given as ($P^*=F_a\/F_0$). At lower $P^*$, the velocity fluctuations during the early phases of cluster aggregation determines how the microstructure develops. If rolling resistance is accounted for the final coordination number adapts to two when initial velocity is low or there is a considerable rolling friction. The pattern of contact forces shows small hyperstatic clusters linked by unstressed arms. As $P^*$ is increased, there is a restructuring towards force chain-like architecture. The density of the material presents fractal behavior which is determined by the density and blob size. The effects of some parameters on the strength of the cohesive material are also studied."}
{"text":"\nStudies of first protostellar cores show they are hydrostatic stellar objects that are generated when the central parts of star-forming cores become optically thick to dust emission. We take a closer look at their observational properties based on their emitted radiation and also discuss how they evolve in time as their mass increases. Special attention is paid to radiative and chemical processes in the postshock relaxation layer of the core surface, which is the main source of the emitted radiation. This radiation has primarily a mid-infrared wavelength of roughly 10-30 microns and will later be reprocessed to far-infrared energy of about 100-200 microns. Although a small fraction of the overall radiation (~0.1) is emitted as H2O lines at the accretion shock, most of it is absorbed and then re-emitted by the dust in the envelope. The H2O lines account for the least (~1\/100) of the observed luminosity. When an outflow or rotation forms a cavity in the envelope, the dust and H2O line emission in mid-infrared wavelengths from the shock can be observed either directly or as a reflection nebula. SPICA is thought to be the ideal observational facility to detect both direct and processed radiation from first core objects."}
{"text":"\nThis paper examines the positivity and near-positivity of biharmonic Green's function with Dirichlet boundary conditions. When higher order elliptic equations and boundary value problems such as the biharmonic equation and the linear clamped plate boundary value problem are considered, a maximum principle, comparison principle, or positivity are not available. This is due to the clamped boundary conditions not allowing the boundary value problem to be thoroughly written as a system of second order boundary value problems. It is revealed, however, that for bounded domains $\\Omega\\subset\\mathbb{R}^n$, with $n\\ge 3$, the negative portion of the Green's function is minor compared to its singular positive portion. Additionally, the biharmonic Green's function for balls $B\\subset\\mathbb{R}^n$ has been proven to be positive under Dirichlet boundary conditions, and is known explicitly. It has been known for some time that the perturbations of the domain in two-dimensions lead to positivity being preserved, and the present study shows this to be true for any $n\\ge 3$ as well."}
{"text":"\nUsing muon spin rotation, the local magnetic field distribution (B(r)) of the mixed state in YB6, a boride superconductor, is investigated. The modified London model and Ginzburg-Landau (GL) model are examined to assess the best fit to the data obtained. It is concluded that the GL model yields a more suitable agreement with the muSR data at higher fields, indicating that detailed knowledge of the field profile near the vortex core is essential when the distance between vortices is near the GL coherence length. Additionally, the temperature and field dependence of the magnetic penetration depth ($\\lambda$) exhibits no indication of low-lying quasiparticle excitation or nonlocal effects. Such evidence suggests the strong coupling of electrons and the rattling motion of Y ions inside of the boron cage, indicating conventional superconductivity with an isotropic s-wave pairing. Furthermore, this result provides an overview of how to assess the anisotropy of superconducting order parameters using the slope of $\\lambda$ compared to field."}
{"text":"\nIn this work, we quantified the lifetime and the mesonic and non-mesonic decay rates of 4He-Lambda hypernuclei. These hypernuclei were created through the reaction 4He(K-,\u03c0-)4He-Lambda at 750 MeV\/c momentum. The lifetime of the 4He-Lambda hypernucleus was measured directly, given a value of \u03c4 = 245 \u00b1 24 ps. Further, the mesonic decay rates were quantified based on the number of pions and pion-zeros collected in the data, producing Gamma_\u03c0-\/Gamma_tot = 0.270 \u00b1 0.024 and Gamma_\u03c00 \/ Gamma_tot = 0.564 \u00b1 0.036 respectively. The proton- and neutron-stimulated decay rates were further calculated from the data as Gamma_p \/ Gamma_tot = 0.169 \u00b1 0.019 and Gamma_n \/ Gamma_tot \u2264 0.032 (95% CL) respectively. The effects of the final-state interactions and possible three-body Lambda N N decay contributions are studied using a model of nucleon-stimulated decay. Furthermore, nucleon-nucleon coincidence events observed were used to draw inferences on the non-mesonic branching fractions. We also consider the implications of this study on the empirical Delta I = 1\/2 rule and the decay rates of 4H-Lambda hypernucleus."}
{"text":"\nWe have conducted a detailed investigation of the stellar and gas properties of the young and luminous (10^4 L_sun) cluster, IRAS 18511+0146. Our study involved the use of sub-millimetre (JCMT-SCUBA), infrared (Spitzer-MIPSGAL, Spitzer-GLIMPSE, Palomar) and radio (VLA) continuum data. We identified a large number of cluster members with bright mid-infrared emission and rising (near to mid-infrared) spectral energy distributions, suggesting that they are very young stellar sources. Moreover, simulations revealed an obscured central part of the protocluster responsible for approximately two-thirds of the total luminosity. Also, a number of filamentary structures and clumps were detected in the mid infrared 8.0 micron image. Based on the total luminosity, cluster size, and evolutionary stage of the cluster members, it is suggested that IRAS 18511+0146 is a protocluster with the most massive object being a precursor to a Herbig Ae\/Be star."}
{"text":"\nThis paper demonstrates the formal and constructive equivalence between three propositions: 1) preferences over outcomes being acyclic; 2) every sequential game having a Nash equilibrium; and 3) every sequential game having a subgame perfect equilibrium. Building upon Kuhn's work in 1953 and Selten's in 1965, this study generalises the concept of sequential game and explores what happens when the usual real-valued payoffs and the corresponding total order are replaced with abstract atomic objects and arbitrary preferences between them. Utilising the Coq proof assistant, this paper demonstrates the aforementioned equivalence and provides an additional guarantee of correctness and clarity in understanding the usefulness of the definitions and proof nature."}
{"text":"\nThe Mielke-Baekler model of three-dimensional AdS gravity with torsion is studied in order to analyze a finite Fefferman-Graham expansion, the holographic stress tensor, and the associated Ward identities. The model showcases a unique Lorentz anomaly due to the asymmetric left- and right-moving central charges in the dual conformal field theory. The covariant and consistent Weyl and Lorentz anomalies are studied, and the Wess-Zumino consistency conditions for the former are demonstrated. Furthermore, a most general solution with flat boundary geometry, relating to left- and right-moving gravitational waves on AdS_3 with torsion, is developed and the central charges in the associated dual CFT are measured. Finally, a discussion of the microstate counting for the Riemann-Cartan black hole is provided."}
{"text":"\nThis paper examines the relationship between the spectrum of the low-lying QCD Dirac operator eigenvalues found in the epsilon-regime and the analogous values predicted by chiral Random Matrix Theory (ChRMT). In order to do this, two-flavor QCD simulations are conducted on a 16^3\\times 32 lattice at a lattice spacing of 0.11 fm and sea quark mass of approximately 3 MeV. The low-lying eigenvalue distributions are compared and show a strong consistency with ChRMT. From the lowest-lying eigenvalues, the chiral condensate is valued at [251(7)(11) MeV]^3, with errors arising from both statistics and higher-order epsilon expansion features. The Dirac operator eigenvalue distributions are additionally evaluated on lattices with heavier sea quark masses at two anomalous lattice spacings and a general agreement between them and ChRMT is observed. Finally, the estimated value of Sigma is consistent with the epsilon-regime interpretation after extrapolation to a chiral limit."}
{"text":"\nThis paper describes a strategy to measure the BAO scale through examination of galaxy samples from the SDSS and 2dFGRS. Through this analysis we measure the BAO scale at z=0.2 and z=0.35, constraining the distance-redshift relation Dv(z) from measurements of the correlated errors. After combining these results with those from the SNLS supernovae survey for a Lambda cosmology and with the WMAP measurement of the apparent acoustic horizon angle in the CMB, we find the ratio Dv(0.35) \/ Dv(0.2) to be 1.812 +\/- 0.060. This result is broadly consistent with the prediction of cosmological acceleration at low redshift, and if we assume a flat cosmological model with constant w, we find the values of Om_m and w to be 0.249 +\/- 0.018 and -1.004 +\/- 0.089, respectively."}
{"text":"\nExamining deep near-infrared and optical imaging from the HDFS and MS1054-03 fields, we study the UV-to-optical colors and magnitudes of galaxies up to z~3. While there was no detection of a red sequence at z~3, we did see a well-defined color-magnitude relation (CMR) among the blue galaxies, in which brighter galaxies had redder U-V colors. The slope of the blue CMR, d(U-V)\/dMV = -0.09 (0.01), is consistent with a correlation between dust-reddening and luminosity. We find that the average color at fixed luminosity reddens substantially from z ~3 to z=0 \\Delta(U-V) = 0.75. This change can mostly be attributed to star aging. In addition, we see small color scatter of galaxies about the blue sequence, sigma(U-V) = 0.25 (0.03), that is mostly constant over the redshift range. Through modeling star formation histories, we explore the implications of this color scatter. In particular, we examine episodic star formation models that successfully reproduce the shape of the scatter at z=2-3, suggesting a rate of active star formation > 40%, and a contrast between the active and inactive states of > 5. However, this model cannot explain the presence of very red galaxies, which may represent galaxies that have entirely stopped forming stars. Finally, we observe an increase of ~6 fold in the relative number densities of red, luminous galaxies from z = 2.7 to z = 0.5, and find that this corresponds to an increase in the overall rest-frame V-band luminosity density. This suggests we are viewing the progressive formation of red, passively evolving galaxies."}
{"text":"\nUsing various analytical methods (SANS, SLS & DLS), we investigate the effect of mutual interaction on the stiffness of bottlebrush macromolecules in a good solvent. The macromolecules monitored consist of a linear backbone with long side chains chemically attached, containing 1600 average monomer units (each second one having 60 monomer units). According to the theoretical model derived from the SLS & SANS extrapolated data, the contour length of the polymer is 380 nm and the persistence length is 17.5 nm. Examining the DLS data confirms these model parameters. The polymer reference interaction site model applied to the scattering intensities at finite concentrations unveils a softening of the bottlebrush polymers caused by their mutual interaction. This phenomenon of softening results in a decrease of persistence from 17.5 nm to 5 nm as the concentration increases from dilute solution to 40.59 g\/l. The decrease in persistence length is similar to the electrostatic decay of linear polyelectrolyte chains attributed to finite concentrations."}
{"text":" By examining nearly 500 red giant stars in 29 galactic open clusters and globular clusters, this empirical study seeks to analyze the changes in strength of the infrared Ca II triplet (8498, 8542 and 8662 \\AA) corresponding with the given metallicity and luminosity. The age and metallicity range of these samples are the widest for which the Ca II triplet has been examined homogeneously. The results suggest a correlation between reduced equivalent width and metallicity, with a second order term if the \\citet{zw84} scale is utilized. It was additionally found that age had only a minor role to play in the relationship. The findings are applied to estimate the metallicities of Berkeley 39, Trumpler 5, and Collinder 110 clusters."}
{"text":"\nWe have detected the presence of CN(N=3-2) emission from the Cloverleaf quasar (z=2.56) for the first time, by utilizing the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer. This emission is a tracer of high density molecular hydrogen clouds, in particular those affected by UV radiation. We can therefore assess the importance of photodissociation regions, radiation field strength and photochemical processes by investigating the HCN\/CN intensity ratio. Our findings suggest a CN(N=3-2) line luminosity of L'(CN(3-2) = (4.5 +\/- 0.5) x 10^9 K km\/s pc^2 when accounting for lensing. This ratio lies within the range of those observed for low-z (ultra-luminous) infrared galaxies. Combining our results with other indicators, such as CO(J=3-2), HCN(J=1-0) etc, indicates a CO\/CN luminosity ratio of 9.3 +\/- 1.9 and HCN\/CN luminosity ratio of 0.95 +\/- 0.15. We hypothesize that the CN(N=3-2) line is mostly sub-thermally excited, thus implying these ratios could be significantly higher than found in this analysis. Overall, CN is a sensitive tool to study the physical conditions and chemical compositions of dense molecular environments at high redshifts."}
{"text":"\nWe are able to demonstrate that perturbed quantum Yang-Mills theory can be consistently applied to a curved, Lorentzian spacetime of global hyperbolicity. To do this, we introduce an algebra of observable operators represented as formal power series. This algebra comprises all gauge-invariant, renormalized and interacting field operators (including the field strength and its derivatives), and their associated relations, such as commutation relations and the operator product expansion - basically a deformation quantization of the Poisson algebra of classical Yang-Mills theory. To overcome the technical difficulty of implementing such a theory, we introduce hierarchy of Ward identities that ensure the conservation of the interacting BRST-current, and the nilpotence of the BRST-charge. We then construct the algebra of physical interacting field observable. Also, we are able to establish that the operator product expansion only serves as a closure on the space of gauge invariant operators, and that the renormalization group flow can only occur in the same space."}
{"text":"This article discusses the use of Random-Set Theory to investigate multiuser detection (MUD) for a dynamic communication system where the number of active users is continuously fluctuating. We aim to develop receivers which can identify not only the transmitted information, but also the number of active users, leading to a more accurate performance in this type of system. Our study will focus on a system that consists of users with unknown parameters entering and leaving the system, and will explore the use of a Bayesian filter to describe the evolution of the a posteriori probability density of the unknown user parameters for optimal detection. In this paper, we investigate user identification and data detection, with the more complex task of parameter estimation considered in a subsequent article."}
{"text":"\nIn this article, we conduct an analysis of collective modes in two-band superconductors in the dirty limit. We establish that collective modes occur in this system at all temperatures below $T_c$, given the frequency of the modes is higher than the inelastic scattering rate and lower than the energy gaps $\\Delta_{a,b}.$ At lower temperatures, the modes represent counterphase oscillations of the condensate currents in each band. Also, the spectrum of these collective oscillations is similar to that of Josephson ''plasma'' modes; however, the velocity of the propagation for this system is much lower. When the temperatures increase between $\\Delta_b$ and $T_c$, two branches of the spectrum emerge, with one of them being gapless and the other possessing a threshold dependent on the band connectivity. We determine the conditions under which both modes can exist, with the collective mode spectrum being revealed through the I-V characteristics of a Josephson junction in the same way as Carlson and Goldman did."}
{"text":"This paper studies the out-of-equilibrium behavior of a line described by the Edwards-Wilkinson equation. The finite-size effects and the crossover to the stationary and equilibrium phases are explored, with an investigation of the decay of structure factor and the growing correlation length along with the roughness of the interface. Additionally, the incoherent scattering function, the response functions and the out-of-equilibrium fluctuations are studied, to gain an understanding of the aging properties of colloidal glasses and vortex glasses."}
{"text":"\nThis paper explores the lithium isotopic ratio in the companion star of the neutron star X-ray binary Cen X-4, making use of UVES spectra obtained in 2000 and 2004 around the orbital quadratures. Monte Carlo simulations were utilized to determine the errors. The results show an abundance of A(Li) of 2.87+-0.20, and an isotopic ratio of 6Li\/7Li = 0.12+0.08-0.05 at a 68% confidence level. Additionally, the refined component masses were determined as 1.14+-0.45 Msun and 0.23+-0.10 Msun for the neutron star and companion respectively. Considering the low levels of 6Li, Li preservation scenarios are favoured, such as inhibited destruction due to the fast rotation of the companion star. Nevertheless, Li production mechanisms cannot be ruled out."}
{"text":"\nThe present study examines the implementation of single and double grids of interacting loaded wires as composite thin layers, and determines mesoscopic material parameters with respect to them. This is accomplished by calculating currents induced by a normally incident plane wave and determining the corresponding dipole moment densities and averaged fields. The derived mesoscopic parameters, which rely on the number of grids, assess the induced polarizations. It is further established that loaded double grids can demonstrate a polarization response which can be termed negative, when taking into account the assigned mesoscopic parameters. The significance of giving negative material parameters is considered with regards to such thin layers, and the outcomes of this method when applied to double-grid structures are compared to results obtained using the conventional S-parameter retrieval process."}
{"text":"\nWe examine the mid-infrared emission of the star-forming HII region N 90,\nassociated with the young stellar association NGC 602 in the Small Magellanic\nCloud, using Spitzer\/IRAC photometry. We classify 57 sources in a 6.2' x 4.8'\nfield-of-view centered on N 90, of which 22 are identified as Young Stellar Objects.  Comparing these possible YSOs to optical sources registered with high-resolution HST\/ACS observations, we pinpoint 17 young stars that are suggestive of ongoing clustered star formation events in the region.  Our survey reveals a pattern of sequential star formation at the edges of a parental molecular cloud cavity, ionized by the growing NGC 602 association."}
{"text":"\nIn this article, we explore the impact of population imbalance on the superfluid phase of a trapped fermion gas in the BCS-BEC crossover regime. We use full numerical calculations of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation combined with the regularized gap and number equations. We present a zero-temperature phase diagram including the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) pairing state that dominates the weak-coupling BCS region of a resonance, but vanishes in the BEC side as the system further becomes phase separated between locally binding superfluid areas and fully polarised spin domains. We also bring forth numerical calculations with a particle number similar to the one observed in recent experiments. This yields the phase separation in the density profile on the resonance, matching recent experiments. Furthermore, we hint at the existance of FFLO modulation that is at its strongest near the population imbalance critical in the weak coupling BCS regime, resulting in higher amplitude and a periodicity larger than the interparticle spacing. We also examine the difference in RF spectroscopy (radio-frequency) between BCS and BEC sides, thus revealing the structure of the pairing field and local magnetization."}
{"text":"\nThis study seeks to understand the correlation between mid-infrared emission and star formation rate (SFR) by examining Spitzer 8 um and 24 um data of star-forming regions in 33 nearby galaxies with related HST\/NICMOS images, and additionally analyzing data on low-metallicity starburst galaxies and Luminous Infrared Galaxies. Results reveal a non-linear relationship between the two emission types, with simple models of stellar populations and dust able to explain the 24 um emission versus number of ionizing photons correlation excluding the 8 um emission. It was determined that 8 um emission was mostly based on dust heated by non-ionizing stellar populations. 2 SFR calibrations were presented; one using the 24 um emission and the other combining the 24 um and H-alpha luminosities to be applied to systems with on-going star formation. Owing to its strong link to both metallicity and environment, no 8 um calibration was presented."}
{"text":"\nThis paper investigates the relationship between aperture efficiency, obtained from the Strehl ratio and the phase efficiency in different radio telescope designs. The idea being that a commercial ray-tracing software can be used to optimize the design. To test this proposition, different tunnel designs spanning a factor of $\\simeq 10 in terms of D\/lambda were simulated with ZEMAX and GRASP9.3. Results indicate that there is a difference between phase efficiency and Strehl ratio of approximately 0.4 to 1.9 up to an offset angle of 40 beams, depending on the design specifics. Notwithstanding this, discrepancies between Strehl ratio and phase efficiency were always less than 0.5 when Strehl ratio was greater than 0.95."}
{"text":"This paper discusses the effects and implications of signature-changing branes\/shells, which are underlying hypersurface layers and can change in their causal signature. Our prior work [1] has been extended, providing more details and better explanations of the regularity and consistent description of signature change in brane\/shells scenarios. We present an example of how a Robertson-Walker geometry with a possible signature change is derived from a static bulk, and then analyse the results for the anti de Sitter case. Finally, discussions are provided on the upper bound of the energy density in asymmetric shells, vanishing of energy density at signature change, and additional relations between the brane\/shell constants, tension, and the properties of the bulk."}
{"text":"\nThis paper investigates the conditions for the occurrence of the confinement\/deconfinement phase transition in AdS\/QCD models in curved spaces, as first proposed by Herzog. We analyze the thermodynamics of AdS black holes with either a sphere or negative constant curvature horizon, which are dual to a non-supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory on a sphere or hyperboloid respectively. Results indicate that, in the case of a spherical horizon, the temperature of the phase transition is increased by the addition of an infrared cutoff, whereas a gap for this cutoff was observed in the hyperbolic horizon case, such that no transition takes place below it. Additionally, we study the effects of charged AdS black holes with finite chemical potential, finding the existence of a gap for the infrared cutoff due to the minimal sizes of the horizons."}
{"text":"  We explored the influence of star formation on the optical\/near-IR colors of\nz~1 early-type galaxies by building a sample of 95 morphologically selected\nearly-type galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts between 0.85 and 1.15 from the\nHDF-N and CDF-S. We measured their 24 micron flux from the deep GOODS-MIPS\nimaging to acquire the IR luminosities and star formation rates. Here, we\nfound that only 17% of the galaxies had significant (>2 sigma) detections at\n24 micron and of these, at least 6 had an AGN. When combining the galaxies with\nand without significant detections, we derived an upper limit on the mean star\nformation rate and specific star formation rate. Our results showed that the obscured star formation has a negligible effect on the rest-frame\noptical\/near-IR SEDs of ~90% of the galaxies in our sample. Our findings suggest the colors predicted by the Bruzual & Charlot (2003) model for these kinds of galaxies are too blue. This shows that the stellar masses of high-redshift galaxies can be overestimated by a factor of ~2."}
{"text":"\nWe present models which capture the dynamics of string networks with multiple interacting string types, each with a distinct tension. These models incorporate the formation of Y-shaped junctions when strings intersect and expressly ensure the conservation of energy. This can be applied to both non-Abelian and entangled strings, such as $Z_{N}$ strings, where interactions are restricted by the underlying topology. Our analysis reveals that in these cases a hierarchy of string densities is formed, with the lightest string type being the most prevalent. We further explore the behavior of cosmic superstring networks, where energy considerations are paramount in dictating interaction outcomes. We find that networks move towards a scaling regime with the three lightest strings types being the most dominant and having equivalent density. A fully quantitative assessment would require a full calculation of the string interaction matrix, but the observed behavior suggests that the presence of junctions does not stop the network from scaling."}
{"text":"In this article, we suggest that the extreme anomalies in the chemical composition of globular cluster stars are the result of a combination of two processes: primordial self-enrichment, which is responsible for oxygen depletion to a minimum value of about [O\/Fe] = -0.4, and extra mixing in a fraction of stars that were pre-born with anomalous composition. Extra mixing in these stars causes oxygen depletion to extreme values, while fluorine depletion and helium enrichment are also expected. Stars that were primordially oxygen-depleted but not extremely helium-rich are not subjected to deep extra mixing."}
{"text":"\nThis article investigates a ferrofluid-based neural network as a viable analog associative memory system. The design entails a system composed of magnetic nano-particles suspended in varying viscosity carrier fluid, responding to a network of magnetic pads. During the training phase, patterns are formed as the particles move and rotate in order to reach the lowest energy. Upon cooling, some of the particles are restrained, thus completing the memory states, which are read out magnetically. Two training algorithms are developed to store multiple patterns and simulations show that the device can accurately store and recall two sets of images."}
{"text":"\nIn this article, we analyze the results of point-contact (PC) spectroscopy measurements of antiferromagnetic (AF) single crystals of HoNi2B2C in the normal and two different superconducting (SC) states (T_c=8.5K and $T_c^*=5.6K). We observe a spectrum of electron-boson (phonon) interactions with maxima at 16, 22, 34, 50, and 100 meV, along with a combination of crystalline-electric-field (CEF) excitations with a peak around 10 meV. Furthermore, a \u2018magnetic\u2019 peak at approximately 3 meV is present. Our evaluation suggests that the 10-meV CEF excitation contributes 20-30% to the PC EPI constant \\lambda_PC while the high energy modes' contribution amounts to around 10% each. Additionally, the SC gap in HoNi2B2C follows a single-band BCS-like pattern and vanishes at a temperature of $T_c^*=5.6K which is lower than the N\u00e9el temperature of 5.2K. According to a strong Eliashberg coupling analysis, \\lambda_s is estimated to be 0.93 for the SC phase occurring at $T_c^*=5.6K. We also provide strong evidence for the \u2018Fermi surface (FS) separation\u2019 scenario for the coexistence of magnetism and superconductivity suggested by us (x) in magnetic borocarbides, where anisotropic FS sheets are responsible for the survivors of the superconductivity occurring at a commensurate AF phase. Lastly, above T_c^*, the PC characteristics show strong suppression of SC features, indicating a weakened SC state between $T_c^*$ and T_c."}
{"text":"This article examines the implications of quantum indistinguishability in the context of particle number. It points out that quantum mechanics does not offer a language for discussing the concept of quantum indistinguishability and that the theory of quasisets (Q) provides a first-order language to portray it. It is determined, though, that Q is not able to capture one of the key characteristics of quantum non-individuality, which is the fact that particle number is not well-defined in some quantum systems. An axiomatic variant of Q, which considers quasicardinality to be a secondary concept for certain quasisets, is also explored. These findings indicate that in theories regarding collections of indistinguishable entities, quasicardinality does not need to be a primitive concept, and can instead be left undefined."}
{"text":"This paper considers the non-commutative Donaldson-Thomas invariants for the conifold. Using the theory of torus localization, it is demonstrated that the invariants count a specific set of pyramid-shaped partition-like configurations that can also be thought of as infinite dimer configurations in the square dimer model with a fixed boundary condition. Furthermore, this partition function is found to be equivalent to an infinite product expansion that factorizes into rank-1 Donaldson-Thomas partition functions of both the commutative crepant resolution of the singularity and its flop. Finally, through speculation, these partition functions are related to the stability of A-modules in the derived category and, thus, provide an instance of wall-crossing within it."}
{"text":"\nThis study of QCD at high density aims to employ an effective model based on the hopping parameter expansion with Polyakov-type loops as its main dynamical variables. A mean field approximation and strong coupling expansion are used to investigate the phase structure of the model. It is revealed that the model suffers from a sign problem at non-zero chemical potential, but it can still be used to design algorithms with a good overlap in Monte Carlo ensembles with the true situation. Results of various observables with regard to the chemical potential and temperature are calculated, such as the charge density and the diquark susceptibility, which can be used for characterizing the phases at high baryonic density. The corresponding phase transitions and crossover regions are thus identified, providing hints for the behaviour of non-zero density QCD."}
{"text":"\nThe coupling between the electromagnetic field and gravity is analyzed in this article. Based on the experimentally-validated conservation laws of electric charge and magnetic flux, the Maxwell equations do not change with the presence or absence of gravity. As such, the charge and flux substrates are not directly influenced by the gravitational field. However, the correlation between these elements, which is formalized as the 'spacetime relation' H=H(F) between the electromagnetic excitation H and electromagnetic field strength F, is affected by gravity. The equivalence principle for electromagnetism is evaluated with the consideration of both local and non-local linear constitutive relations. Results demonstrate that the spacetime metric may be accompanied by skewon, dilaton, and axion fields, thus potentially leading to the violation of the equivalence principle."}

{"text":"\nThis study reports the discovery of late-type red supergiants in both the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds. We measure their physical properties and place them on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. The stars' radial velocities indicate they most likely belong to the Clouds rather than nearby dwarf stars or halo giants. Surprisingly, these stars appear to be cooler than the expected Hayashi limit, a region of the diagram where stars are no longer in equilibrium. We also find the stars to be variable across the visible spectrum. Three in particular experienced significant temperature and spectral type changes over the times of months. Among these, one SMC supergiant was recorded to be as late as an M4.5 I state, unusually late for its parent galaxy. The changes in luminosity, accompanied by circumstellar dust absorption, also indicate an unstable period of evolution. Therefore, we hypothesize these stars may represent a short-lived evolutionary phase."}
{"text":"\nIn this paper, we address the question: what is the minimum mass planet which can open a gap in an accretion disk which is illuminated by the star's radiation? We develop an equation that, when given realistic parameters such as mass and luminosity of the Sun, accretion rate and viscosity parameter $\\alpha$ of the disk, can predict the minimum mass required for a planet to open a gap. Our results indicate that a planet of half the mass of Jupiter can open a gap in a disk with an accretion rate of $10^{-8} M_\\odot$\/yr for an $\\alpha$ of 0.01. Additionally, two radii were identified in which the planet could, with increased mass, begin to open a gap in the disk and thus slow its migration. If a clearing of the disk does occur due to the gap-opening planet, we found that the inner radius of that clearing would be dependent on the mass of the star."}
{"text":"\nThis paper provides the absolute proper motions of six globular clusters (NGC 2808,\n3201, 4372, 4833, 5927 and 5986) from the Hipparcos system which have not been previously measured. We find that the proper motion uncertainties range from 0.3 to 0.5 mas\/yr. Our results suggest that one of the clusters (NGC 5927) belongs to the thick disk and that the rest are on highly eccentric orbits of low energy. We deduce that the most energetic cluster (NGC 3201) is on a retrograde orbit reaching out to 22 kpc. Additionally, none of the clusters appear to be related to the recently discovered SDSS streams nor the Monoceros structure. This research is part of the Southern Proper-Motion Program (SPM) whose second-epoch observations were taken with a CCD camera attached to the double astrograph at El Leoncito, Argentina."}
{"text":"\nThis investigation explores the concept of terrestrial planet formation in binary star systems - the most common result of the star formation process - and the potential ability for these companions to disrupt the formation of and longterm prospects for stability of these planets. Through numerical simulations, we investigate the growth of terrestrial planets - from Moon- to Mars-sized objects - in main-sequence binary star systems, with consideration of accretion around the two stars ('P-type'), or individual stars ('S-type'), as well as in comparison to the growth in our Solar System. Our simulations show that, depending on the binary separation, presence of giant planets and disk parameters, approximately 50 - 60% of binary star systems remain habitable based on their dynamics. The results of these simulations can be adapted to different systems in order to assess their viability."}
{"text":" This work proposes an observational approach to detect and distinguish between visible and dark matter concentrations in globular clusters as well as other components of the galaxy, by studying the relativistic time delay of pulsar radiation in the gravitational field of a massive object (the Shapiro effect) located close to the line of sight. The probability of such an event was analyzed for two different models of the galactic stellar distribution: the Bahcall-Soneira model and the Dehnen-Binney model. Three globular clusters (M15, 47 Tuc, Terzan 5) were used as an example. Results showed that relative probabilities of Shapiro-effect-caused event in 47 Tuc and M15 are more or less equal to that of events in the clusters themselves, larger than in Terzan 5. Moreover, a numerical estimate of the rate of such events was conducted, and it was revealed that the number of objects near the line of sight to the pulsar can create modulations in its pulse arrival times, a feature associated with the effect in question. This study is also the first to investigate the dense population of brown dwarfs in the galactic disk and its related concentration similar to that of the disk stars."}
{"text":"\nThis work seeks to investigate potential selection biases present in the mass function of galaxy clusters. For this project, galaxy cluster candidates were identified from XMM-Newton Follow-Up Survey data utilizing weak gravitational lensing, optical Postman matched filter and detection of extended X-ray sources. Moreover, the performance of the aperture mass statistic was assessed on simulated ray-tracing experiments that resembled the survey criteria. Subsequently, shape noise was found to be the main source of noise at any detection level, and it was determined that clusters detected by projection of large-scale structures were negligible with the exception of highly significant detections. Ultimately, a sample of 155 separate cluster candidates, comprising of 116 Postman matched filter detections, 59 extended X-ray sources and 31 shear selected clusters were established, the majority of which were previously unknown. This cluster catalog is a key resource to study selection effects associated to either method."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate the possibility of direct injection of material from supernovae into protoplanetary disks through a model that suggests the number of stars with disks decreases with time while their surface density stays the same with an increasing cluster volume. We assume that the masses of the stars responsible for supernovae explosions are at least 75-100 solar masses. Our findings indicate that a relatively small area around a supernova is capable of enriching protoplanetary disks to the levels that are seen in the Solar System. However, this likelihood appears to be about 1%. If the origins of short lived radionuclides found in meteorites are tied to supernovae, our research implies that the Solar System formed in one of the largest clusters in the Milky Way with a high concentration of supernovae and the chances of enrichment in many different disks were higher."}
{"text":"\nIn this article, we examine the states, interactions, Hubble expansion rates and astrophysical outcomes that could arise from the Calabi-Yau IIB string compactifications, which have moduli stabilised to an exponentially long volume V ~ 10^{15} l_s^6 and an intermediate string scale m_s ~ 10^{11}GeV and observer created supersymmetry breaking at the TeV level. Unexpectedly, all K\\\"ahler moduli aside from the volume factor are more massive than the supersymmetry breaking level, with a kg of m ~ ln(M_P\/m_{3\/2}) m_{3\/2} ~ (\\ln(M_P\/m_{3\/2}))^2 m_{susy} ~ 500 TeV, and their coupling with matter is bounded by the string scale instead of the Planck scale. This leads to their disintegration early in the history of the universe and a reheat temperature T ~ 10^7 GeV. The overall volume modulus would be an extremely small particle of mass m ~ 1 MeV coupled to the Planck mass and prone to the cosmological moduli problem (CMP). To dodge this conundrum, a period of thermal inflation may be beneficial.\nThis modulus has a life span of ~ 10^{24}s and can partake in dark matter. Its potential is detectable through the two paths of 2\\gamma or e^+e^-, the later being dominant because of the Br(\\chi \\to 2 \\gamma) being suppressed by a multiple of (ln(M_P\/m_{3\/2}))^2. It is concluded that the current gamma-ray background restricts \\Omega_{\\chi} <~ 10^{-4}. Furthermore, the 511 keV emission line fromINEGRAL\/SPI may result from the decays of this modulus."}
{"text":"\nWe present findings from detailed observations of five quasars with very strong intervening calcium II absorption systems at redshifts below 0.5 taken from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. These rare occurrences may be linked to damped Lyman alpha systems. In every case, a galaxy at the same redshift is located within 24 kpc from the observed QSO. Additionally, the four brightest galaxies featured in our observations are luminous, metal-rich spiral galaxies; their star formation rates, stemming from H-alpha emission, are in the range between 0.3 and 30 Msun\/yr. Following our analysis, we emphasize the necessity for dust and stellar absorption correction for a more accurate measure of star formation rates in DLA-selected galaxies. We delve further into the potential link between Calcium II-selected galaxies and DLAs and lay out suggestions for future observations in order to make a solid connection between these two types of quasar absorbers."}
{"text":"\nUsing archival Hubble Space Telescope images, we examine 21 globular clusters situated around the Large Magellanic Cloud, 5 around the Small Magellanic Cloud, and 4 around the Fornax dwarf galaxy. Our results, acquired by a technically advanced integrated light measuring procedure, demonstrate that two thirds of the sample are brighter than earlier estimates made by star count measurements, with variances as high as two magnitudes per arcsecond squared. Additionally, roughly 40% of the profiles show a deviation from the theoretically defined flat-central-core concept. We found that the central logarithmic slopes for these clusters were distributed between -0.2 and -1.2. Comparing our results with those of a sample of globular clusters in the Milky Way, we discerned a correlation between age and core radius: younger clusters tend to have smaller core radii and higher central surface brightness. Taken together, the results of this study appear to demonstrate that the concentration of globular clusters at birth may be higher than previously assumed, and that the predicted flat-core profile may not be the most suitable initial condition model."}
{"text":"\nIn this paper, we perform cosmological simulations that explore the preheating scenario for galaxy cluster formation, which entails the introduction of a uniform entropy boost at early times. We closely examine both analytic models for preheating, which assume a smooth and regular accretion history, and compare them to the preheated cosmological simulations. We find that when the unmodified profile is taken directly from simulations, the preheating model accurately approximates the results of our simulations. We also compare our results to recent observations, suggesting that a reasonable amount of preheating is consistent with the available data regarding the mass-temperature and luminosity-temperature relations. However, the computed entropy profiles fail to match the observed values, particularly at the core and outer radii. This implies that the preheating scenario is incompatible with observed data."}
{"text":"\nThis article provides an introduction to Open Access publishing in the field of particle physics. It is not a new concept, as the preprint and arXiv.org have long been in place, but european physicists and funding agencies are now looking at how to move toward a fully Open Access model. Research shows that 90% of high energy physics literature is already freely available online. Libraries are now cancelling journal subscriptions, so a new approach to open access publishing is necessary. SCOAP3 is just one consortium proposed to help provide an alternative to traditional open access models. At the very least, these ideas should be looked at and possibly adopted for the benefit of the field."}
{"text":"This paper investigates linear tabling, a recent iterative approach for logic programming, and explores two strategies, lazy and eager, for handling looping subgoals. Comparable performance to the naive method is achieved through early answer promotion, an optimization technique which attempts to avoid redundant joins of answers. Furthermore, benchmarks in B-Prolog demonstrate that this optimization helps linear tabling compare favorably to the current leading implementation of SLG."}
{"text":"\nThis survey of 30 early-type galaxies (E and S0) from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) involved the NRAO Green Bank Telescope (GBT) to investigate the hydrogen content related to recent star formation. 19 galaxies had HI detected in emission. Compared to disk galaxies of similar luminosity, the K+A and star forming early-type galaxies were observed to have lower levels of atomic hydrogen, yet more than typical E and S0 galaxies. Star formation rates and estimated time scales suggest that these galaxies have limited capability to change their hydrogen content. Follow-up observations are necessary to explore these same topics in terms of molecular gas which is more likely to participate in the star formation process. The data obtained from this research suggest that the atomic hydrogen is present within 1 kpc of the galaxy center closest to the star forming regions."}
{"text":"This article explores the application of a stochastic model in the context of animal movement in an environment with varying preference. Our method involves the determination of a closed-form solution for the steady-state probability distribution using the factorization of the redistribution operator. We then determine how space use is affected by the preference function w, particularly in relation to the characteristic width of the redistribution kernel. Data simulations show insight into the effects of kernel width and we explore the behavior at discontinuities in w as well. This solution offers a rapid computation for model parameter fitting and inverse modeling that can be beneficial in home range analysis."}
{"text":"\nWe probe the shock breakout of a Type II-P supernova named SN 2006bp. We present HET optical spectroscopy and unfiltered ROTSE-III photometry for the first 11 months following the explosion. It suggested that the supernova was first detected a few hours after the shock breakout occurred. Two-day-old spectra exhibited features stemming from HeII 4200, HeII 4686, and CIV 5805 in the rest frame. These were absent in subsequent spectra taken later. We speculate that they are a product of the high energy photons released at the shock breakout, originating from the outer layers of the progenitor. Additionally, a P-Cygni profile around 4450 A was observed in two spectra following the explosion. We discuss its possible origins, as well as measure the expansion velocity of key features. A slow cooling was detected in the quasi-bolometric light curve up until 25 days following the explosion; however, there is no evidence for an early peak."}
{"text":"\nThe Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) is home to the STAR spin physics program which works to understand the inner workings of the proton by utilizing transverse or longitudinal polarized proton beams at $\\sqrt{s}=200-500$ GeV. Working to uncover the spin structure and dynamics of the proton, these studies provide a deeper insight into Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). The main goal of the STAR spin physics program is to determine the polarized gluon distribution function through the recognition of the longitudinal double-spin asymmetry, $A_{LL}$, as presented in recent results for inclusive jet production, neutral pion production, and charged pion production at $\\sqrt{s}=200$ GeV. Measurements with transverse polarized beams such as the transverse single-spin asymmetry, $A_{N}$ , are also conducted. New data from the STAR collaboration will be shared on the measurement of $A_{N}$ for forward neutral pion production, and the first detection of $A_{N}$ for mid-rapidity di-jet production."}
{"text":"This article studies the structure of Poisson polynomial algebras derived from semiclassical limits of quantized coordinate rings. Necessary and sufficient conditions for a rational action of a torus on an algebra to only leave finitely many Poisson prime ideals unmoved are given. This, in tandem with prior studies of the first-named author, leads to the confirmation of the Poisson Dixmier-Moeglin equivalence for a wide range of Poisson polynomial rings, such as semiclassical limits of quantum matrices, quantum symplectic and euclidean spaces, quantum symmetric and antisymmetric matrices. Furthermore, it is established that quotient fields of such algebras (or its Poisson prime factor rings) combine to form a rational function field $F(x_1,...,x_n)$ over the base field (or its extension field). This is a quadratic Poisson version of the Gel'fand-Kirillov problem, while partial solutions to the isomorphism problem of Poisson fields are obtained as well."}
{"text":"\nIn this work, we examine the effects of integrating birefringent layers with misaligned in-plane anisotropy into periodic layered structures to promote slow wave resonance. This layer configuration can decrease the size of the photonic-crystal Fabry-Perot resonator by an order of magnitude while maintaining performance. Notably, this setup gives rise to an overlap of photonic band edges, which is beneficial for practical applications like antennae, light amplification, optical and microwave filters, among other things. A key issue with this configuration, however, is the reflection of one of the incident wave's polarization components back to space. To combat this problem, we propose refinements to the layered array that can provide a perfect impedance match for any incident wave polarization, and still retain the resonance capabilities of the degenerate photonic band edge."}

{"text":"\nThe instantaneous positions and velocities of Hypervelocity Stars (HVSs) ejected from the Galactic Center provide insight into the asymmetrical potential of the Milky Way, and allow us to estimate the triaxiality of its dark matter halo. By studying the trajectories of these stars at large Galactocentric distances (r>~50kpc) and their deviation from being radial, we can measure the magnitude of the change in angular momentum caused by the asymmetry of the Milky Way's flattened disk and triaxial dark matter halo. We propose an estimator of dark halo triaxiality based on the deflection angles (the angle between the star's position and velocity vector) of HVSs on bound orbits. Our findings indicate that, in the case of a triaxial halo, the distribution of these angles is spread uniformly between 10 and 180 degrees. Future surveys with precise astrometric and wide-field measurements of the positions and velocities of HVSs will provide important constraints for the shape of the Galactic dark halo."}
{"text":"This study investigates the dust-to-gas ratio in different types of luminous, ultraluminous, and hyperluminous infrared galaxies. Through modelling the radio to soft X-ray spectral energy distributions, two types of clouds are discovered to contribute to the infrared emission; those with low shock velocities and low preshock densities and those with high velocities and densities. The results indicate that AGN's are present in nearly all of the ultraluminous and half of the luminous IR galaxies, while high IR luminosities rely on dust-to-gas ratios of 0.1 by mass. However, dust-to-gas ratios in hyper luminous IR galaxies are found to be significantly lower than those of luminous and ultraluminous IR galaxies."}
{"text":"This article provides an analysis of Parteli, Duran and Herrmann's model regarding the minimal size of barchan dunes. It is argued that the model is not self-consistent, since under large wind the dune size cannot decrease to zero due to grain inertia. Moreover, discussion of the typical dune wavelength on Mars is refuted in favour of the scaling of the dune size with the drag length. The article delves deeper into the grain size on Mars from thermal diffusion measurements, and evidence from photographs by rovers of bedforms that include small grains and millimetre-scale hematite spherules that cannot be entrained by reasonable winds. This provides yet another argument against Parteli et al.'s model."}

{"text":"\nThis paper proffers a unique configuration of photons associated with a spin of $\\hbar$, and a sibling configuration of fermions connected to a spin of $\\hbar\/2$. This leads to further conclusions that elementary particles of spin $\\hbar\/2$ cannot have a mass inferior to $1m_e$ and a radius greater than $1l_e$. Additionally, it suggests that the electrostatic force is connected to centrifugal forces associated with the spin, and propagated by photons. The immense differences between the centripetal and centrifugal forces on the surface of protons causes quantic spacetime fluctuations, resulting in energy transfers necessary for equilibrium, possibly understood as the source of gravity and the strong force. Finally, the mass of the proton and the mass of the neutron must relate to each other in a very specific fashion, with the former being slightly less than 1851$m_e$, otherwise the molecular nucleus would not hold itself together. It is further suggested that the 'messenger particles' in any interaction are real photons, as opposed to hypothetical 'gravitons' or 'gluons'."}
{"text":"\nWe have carried out an all-optical investigation of spin relaxation in\nInAs\/GaAs quantum dots (QDs) with imposed static external electric and magnetic\nfields.

These interactions include hyperfine coupling between a QD and its\nnuclear spin ensemble, spin-phonon coupling, and exchange-type interactions\nwith a nearby Fermi sea of electrons.

It formulates a new positivity criterion for hermitian matrices, an entanglement criterion for composite systems, and reviews the connection between positive maps and entanglement with random matrices.

{"text":"\nThis paper examines the relaxation of a dewetting contact line in what is referred to as the 'Landau-Levich' geometry. Here, a vertical plate is being withdrawn from a liquid bath that partially wets the plate. The hydrodynamics at all scales (from molecular to macroscopic) are resolved through the analysis of a lubrication theory. The bifurcation diagram for unperturbed contact lines is more complex than expected from simplified theories involving an apparent contact angle. A linear stability analysis demonstrates that below the critical capillary number, the contact line is stable at all wavenumbers, and compared favorably to the quasi-static approach. However, as the critical number is approached, another mechanism takes over and the dispersion changes from |q| to q^2. These results indicate that contact lines should not be assumed to obey a single effective law for the macroscopic contact angle, but instead require explicit consideration of viscous effects."}
{"text":"\nWe argue that quantum mechanics (QM) can actually be compatible with macroscopic realism (PMRs) principles, rather than the physicist's admiration of Bell's theorem and quantum nonlocality. The notion that \"the state of a system can be instantaneously changed by a distant measurement\" does not constitute a physical theory and the EPR-Bell experiments and theorems outlined to prove nonlocality are not actually true. Born's averaging rule and other quantum postulates cannot be applied to Cat states in the same way, because it violates the core correspondence principle. However, it is possible to combine both PMRs and the superposition principle together in the case of a one-electron micro-Cat state. Our one-dimensional completed scattering model demonstrates how these two principles can coexist."}
{"text":"We present research focusing on the magnetic long-range order at the ground-state of quasi-one-dimensional quantum Heisenberg antiferromagnets for spin quantum numbers s=1\/2 and s=1. Using the coupled cluster method, we determine the sublattice magnetization in function of the inter-chain coupling. Results show that an enormously small inter-chain coupling is effective in establishing long-range order for the unfrustrated spin-1\/2 system. For spin s=1, however, an inter-chain coupling of 10% of the in-chain coupling is necessary to give stability to the magnetic order. Moreover, we consider the case of a quasi one-dimensional spin-1\/2 system where a frustrating next-nearest neighbor in-chain coupling is also included. We observe that for stronger frustration, a finite inter-chain coupling is needed for magnetic long-range order; this amounts to the spin gap of the isolated chain."}
{"text":"\nThis study examines the dynamics of receding contact lines through controlled experiments. It is demonstrated that large-scale flows and their geometrical arrangements strongly intervene in the breakdown of stationary menisci at the coating transition. A hydrodynamic theory is employed to investigate the dispersion relation for high wavenumbers, revealing that sigma is directly proportional to q. The results of this research confirm the absence of diverging timescales at the critical point and the speed of the system. Additionally, this article outlines unsolved problems with regards to contact angle hysteresis."}
{"text":"\nIn this work, we explore the consequences of introducing noise onto a proposed graph state generation scheme based on a mirror inverting spin chain. To measure the performance of this chain as a quantum processor, we calculate the average channel fidelity for single qubits, and the average gate fidelity for two-qubit entangling operations. We also evaluate whether these operations maintain the entangling capabilities and become entanglement breaking when exposed to local decaying, dephasing, thermal, and depolarizing noise. Surprisingly, we find that local decay and dephasing noise do not induce entanglement breaking. However, thermal and depolarizing noise are found to lead to a critical length and critical noise coupling respectively, beyond which entanglement breaking occurs. The critical noise coupling for local depolarizing noise is also observed to exhibit a power-law dependence as a function of chain length. In addition, the average gate fidelity of a constructed five qubit linear cluster state and a Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state suggest that the noise tolerated for graph state generation is limiting."}

Further, using Noether symmetry on the scalar-tensor Lagrangian, we are able to independently arrive at the same form of coupled and potential functions, along with obtaining a conserved charge and deriving exact solutions by first integrals of motion."}
{"text":"We have conducted a study of the parallel tracks of near-infrared (NIR) and X-ray emission\nfrom black hole X-ray transient outbursts. Analyzing existing data, we have discovered a possible\nhysteresis effect: the NIR flux is weaker in the rising low\/hard state of an outburst than on its\ndecline, at a given X-ray luminosity. We consider interpretations of this effect,\nincluding a shift in the radiative efficiency of inflowing or outflowing matter, variability in\ndisc viscosity and the power or spectrum of the jet.

{"text":"\nA study of HLIRGs using XMM-Newton is presented here with a sample of fourteen sources. These HLIRGs are unique objects to observe the connection between extreme star formation and its relationship to supermassive black holes. Results indicate that AGN strongly dominate the X-ray spectral emission, with half of the sample candidates for being violently absorbed. It is found that soft X-ray emission can be attributed to both starburst and AGN origins. The X-ray emission is lower than expected for a standard local QSO, implying the existence of absorbtion for type 2 sources and\/or non-standard SEDs for quasars. Lastly, the X-ray to IR luminosity ratio is constant across redshift suggesting similar evolutions for AGN and starburst components."}
{"text":"\nThis article explores the potential of a new approach to the comparison of DNA strands among different populations, which offers an alternative to the expensive and time-consuming sequencing and cloning methods typically used for such analyses. DNA hash pooling is a filtering process involving multiple criteria to produce pools of either high or very high sequence purity. We demonstrate how this method can be used in the genome detection, sequence query, and similarity discovery of environmental samples. Using pairwise restriction enzymes as examples, we illustrate the sensitivity of this method to laboratory errors and its capability of reducing the required amount of sequencing by an order of magnitude. Ultimately, the cost- and time-efficiency of this method makes it beneficial even if sequencing technologies become cheaper in the future."}
{"text":"\nIn this paper, we explore the general structure of Fermi conformal nets of von Neumann algebras on the circle and introduce a new class of topological representations known as general representations, which can be attributed to either Neveu-Schwarz or Ramond representations. Furthermore, we compute a formula involving the Fredholm index of the supercharge operator and the associated Jones index. We also examine a net related to the super-Virasoro algebra and its corresponding structure when the central charge c is part of the discrete series. By looking at a Ramond irreducible representation with lowest weight c\/24, we verify our proposed setting. Finally, we classify all the irreducible Fermi extensions of any super-Virasoro net in the discrete series, thus providing a comprehensive classification of all superconformal nets with a central charge less than 3\/2."}
{"text":"\nThis paper presents a novel, decidable logic suitable for expressing and verifying invariants of programs which utilize pointers and destructible updates to manage dynamic objects. A distinguishing feature of this logic is that it is able to limit the range of nodes which can be accessed in a regular expression from a designated node. The logic is also closed under boolean operations and has a finite model property. Furthermore, we prove the decidability of the formula and demonstrate the use of the logic for verifying preconditions, postconditions, and loop invariants. This logic can be used to certify the partial correctness of programs that employ low-level heap modifications, checking properties such as separability of data structures and lower level heap updates. Our logic can also be used to express properties of any data structure and for any number of pointer fields, allowing for the expression of postconditions regarding the fields before and after a process."}
{"text":"This article provides evidence for a contribution from jets to the OIR light of low-magnetic field neutron star X-ray binaries. By analyzing quasi-simultaneous OIR and X-ray data from 19 different sources, we found that the radio-OIR spectrum for NSXBs is alpha ~ +0.2, even at high luminosities where the radio jet is detected. Optically thin synchrotron emission from the jets dominates the NIR light above L_x ~ 10^36 erg\/s and the optical above L_x ~ 10^37 erg\/s from atolls and millisecond X-ray pulsars, while X-ray reprocessing is the only source of OIR emission in Z-sources, with synchrotron emission potentially making a low level contribution to the NIR."}
{"text":"\nThis article investigates the consequences of final state interaction (FSI) on semi inclusive deep inelastic electron scattering processes on both the deuteron ($A=2$) and complex nuclei ($A > 2$). The mechanisms of proton production are evaluated with respect to the understanding of the non-perturbative hadronization process and the deep inelastic structure functions of bound nucleons. Specifically, the deuteron target within the kinematical range of existing and upcoming Jlab data is studied. Results suggest that there are regions where the FSI impact is minimized to allow for the investigation of deep inelastic DIS structure functions, as well as regions where FSI effects from the quark-gluon debris and residual nucleus interactions are maximized for the better understanding of the hadronization process. Calculations were completed using realistic wave functions and spectral functions, and an eikonal approximation and optical potential to evaluate nuclear structure and FSI, respectively."}
{"text":"\nBy using a numerical approach in two spatial dimensions plus time, we investigate the scalar-field perturbations created by a particle moving around a black hole. We find that perturbations in the Kerr space-time can only be fully resolved in two and a half dimensions. In cases where the source of the field is a pointlike particle, there is a logarithmic divergence associated with the azimuthal modes of the 2+1-dimensional perturbation. To address this problem, we split the numerical domain into two separate regions: within a thin, worldtube-shaped region near the particle's trajectory, we calculate the regularized variable by removing a fitting, ``puncture'' function that can be determined analytically; outside of the worldtube, we solve for the original field. We show the feasibility of this technique by examining the scalar field generated by a circular orbit in the Schwarzschild black hole, without invoking any spherical symmetry."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate the MHD turbulence in an accretion disk driven by the magnetorotational instability (MRI). We use the local shearing box model and assume a vanishing initial magnetic flux in the disk at the start of our simulation. The domain is observed by a finite-difference code, called ZEUS, to develop the ideal MHD equations. After computing different simulations with increasing resolution, we find that the turbulent activity gradually reduces. We measure this activity with the alpha parameter, which reveals decreases from 0.004 to 0.001 as resolution increases. An examination in Fourier space indicates that the MRI forcibly drives energy down to the dissipation scale of the grid. We also investigate the numerical dissipation in the ZEUS code which is characterised by the effective magnetic Reynolds number Re_M. This increases from 10^4 to 10^5 when the grid resolution moves from 64 to 256 respectively. Our results show that numerical dissipation can not be overlooked as an important determinant of the MHD turbulence at the resolutions usually considered, and needs to be taken into account when running simulations with zero net flux in accretion disks."}
{"text":"\nIn this paper, we investigate the influence of transport coefficients (viscosity and\nresistivity) on MHD turbulence driven by the magnetorotational instability\n(MRI) in accretion disks.

We employ various numerical codes\n(ZEUS, NIRVANA, the PENCIL code and a spectral code) to demonstrate the convergence of our results and the\nindependence of the numerical scheme. We observe that the rate of angular momentum \ntransport is dependent on the magnetic Prandtl number Pm and increases with its rising value,\nwhile turbulence disappears when the Prandtl number drops below a critical value Pm_c \nthat decreases with the Reynolds number Re.

{"text":"This paper presents a comparison between linear stability analysis and observations of the pulsation modes in five delta Scuti stars belonging to the same cluster. A new approach is used in this study that looks for a single, complete, and coherent solution for all the selected stars. This makes use of advanced descriptions for the effects of rotation on estimation of global stellar parameters and on calculating the adiabatic oscillation frequency. Additionally, the role of rotation in predicting mode instabilities is assessed. The findings of this work is in line with the conclusion of Michel et al. (1999). It is found that in the temperature range log T_eff = 3.87-3.88, agreement between observations and model computations of unstable modes is seen only when the mixing-length parameter alpha_nl is less or equal to 1.50. This indicates that for these stars, a smaller value for alpha_nl is required than what is suggested from a calibrated solar model. It must be noted that the presented linear stability analysis still does not consider effects of rotation on pulsation dynamics and further developments are required for a proper understanding."}

If these CRs have energies of\nless than 10^7 eV, the ionization rate near the minihalo's center could be\ngreater than 10^-19 s^-1, resulting in increased molecular cooling and a\ncharacteristic stellar mass of ~10 M_sun. In larger dark matter haloes between\n10^8-10^15 M_sun, cooling to background cosmic microwave temperatures can\nalready occur. Thus, our research suggests a possible impact of CRs on the\nformation of Population III stars."}
{"text":"\nWe present the discovery of two unusual, low-luminosity quasars at redshift z~4 which show a prominent N IV] 1486A emission line. Finding such a feature in two out of 23 objects in our sample (8.6%) is particularly remarkable as this line is ordinarily rarely seen in quasar spectra regardless of redshift. This uncommon observation may be indicative of starbursts in associated, early galaxies. Alternatively, we may be witnessing the early stages of quasar broad emission line region evolution. The finding of no N V 1240A line in one of these quasars may provide evidence for the latter. Together, these objects could point to either a new population of faint quasars or to an AGN evolutionary phase in its infancy at high redshifts."}
{"text":"\nThis paper explores the possibilities of using an optical cavity to enable the laser cooling of molecules, which would otherwise suffer from an excessive number of lossy Raman channels. Our investigations into the parameters and requirements of cavity-assisted laser cooling showed that cooperative interactions much above unity are needed to achieve efficient cooling, something that could be made possible with the superradiant scattering associated with molecules localized in an optical cavity. Of particular interest to us is the polar hydroxyl radical (OH) which can easily be obtained from Stark deceleration at low temperatures."}
{"text":"\nOur research looks into the isophotal properties and dust features of 84 radio galaxies bright enough to be viewed by the Hubble Space Telescope. We understand that boxy isophotes tend to appear when we examine edge-on disks and round or elliptical isophotes emerge when the disks are seen face-on. This suggests that isophotal boxiness is linked to how the observer views the host galaxy's symmetry. We further analyzed that dust-rich sources usually contain extended filaments instead of organized disks. We conclude that well-defined dusty disks are found in relics of gas-poor mergers while the filaments are more common among the younger gas-rich mergers."}
{"text":"\nWe analyze the 3-year WMAP polarization data that has been corrected for foregrounds, using a Gibbs sampling method. The results of this analysis are compared to those found by the WMAP team and found to be aligned. However, further analysis is done to separate the Q- and V-bands, accounting for non-zero EB cross correlations and adding in the amplitudes of synchrotron and dust emission. Deviations are found in these, signifying systematics that should be taken into account. These are especially important due to the low-l EE spectrum influencing parameters such as tau and n_s."}
{"text":"\nThis article provides a comprehensive and intuitive explanation of how to apply Hartley's information formula to construct a Generalized Information Formula for measuring not only metrical information (e.g. temperatures), but also sensory (e.g. colors) and semantic information (e.g. weather forecasts). It further discusses the compatibility between the Generalized Information Formula and Popper's Knowledge Evolution Theory and further applies it to optimize data compression by introducing the Rate-of-Limiting-Errors and its similarity with the complexity-distortion theory; the Rate-Fidelity theory, which replaces Shannon's distortion with Subjective Mutual Information, is then proposed and proved to be equivalent to Generalized Information formulas when used in lossy and lossless coding. The article then examines the Rate-Fidelity function in relation to the visual discrimination of digitized bits of images, in order to conclude that subjective information is not greater than objective (Shannon's) information, and that for a specified amount of visual discrimination, a matched information exists that increases with visual discrimination and any additional resolution is wasteful."}
{"text":"\nWe explore a diagrammatic method to understand the dynamics of density fluctuations in equilibrium systems composed of interacting Brownian particles. To do this, we present a basis of orthogonalized many-particle density fluctuations from which an exact hierarchy of equations of motion for time-dependent correlations can be obtained. Thus, we are able to provide a simplified version of this hierarchy by disregarding higher-order cluster expansion terms and using diagrams with three and four-leg vertices for an iterative solution. Additionally, we examine the structure of the diagrammatic series for the time-dependent density correlation function, giving a diagrammatic interpretation of reducible and irreducible memory functions. Finally, the one-loop self-consistent approximation for the irreducible memory function is shown to coincide with previously developed mode-coupling approximation."}
{"text":"\nWe analyze 22 early-type galaxies where stellar dynamical measurements have been made, and employ standard cold dark matter halo models to approximate the mass distributions. Our results show that the individual galaxies lack a precise way to constrain the halo models; however, the ensemble of systems provide a strong constraint on the average stellar mass. Our estimates yield a star formation efficiency of 10-30%, and a local B-band stellar mass-to-light ratio of 7.2$(M_{\\sun}\/L_{\\sun})$ per unit redshift, which can be loosely verified by local estimates and weak lensing measurements. Adjusting the stellar orbits has a minimal effect on our results."}
{"text":"\nThis article examines the rate of energy transfer between throats in 10 dimensional string theory. If one throat is heated as a consequence of cosmological evolution, the subsequent exchange of energy can take place either with other throats, or with fields in the unwarped bulk of the Calabi-Yau orientifold. A dual gauge theory is utilized to calculate the rate of Energy feedback based on the AdS scales of the corresponding throats and the distance between them. Findings suggest that there is a suppression of energy transfer rates if the size of the Calabi-Yau orientifold is much larger than the AdS radii of the throats. Such a phenomenon has direct implications for the study of reheating after brane inflation."}
{"text":"\n\nThis study suggests the potential origin of the dichotomy between the two coherently structured populations of young stars within 0.5pc from the Galactic Center. We propose that both stellar populations originated from the same disk about 6 Myr ago and have been affected by an intruding object, believed to be either an IMBH or a dark stellar cluster containing an IMBH, of ~10^4 Msun. This disturber has supposedly migrated inward due to the force of dynamical friction, capturing stars in its outer regions and dragging them along. This has caused them to experience close encounters and thus, altered their original eccentricinaitons and inclinations, while the stellar system closer to the center remained unchanged. Testing the validity of this hypothesis would be possible by detailed kinematic measurements of the affected outer region stars, which could potentially lead to the discovery of an IMBH or dark stellar cluster near the massive black hole of the GC."}
{"text":"\nWe present a semi-analytical coupled-mode theory for both second-harmonic and third-harmonic generation via chi2 and chi3 nonlinearities in any doubly resonant nonlinear cavity, taking into account the effects of inhomogeneity and cavity parameters. We derive explicit formulas for the nonlinear coupling coefficients and find that these parameters, along with cavity properties, determine a critical power which is necessary to achieve 100 percent frequency conversion. By using reasonable cavity parameters, we predict that perfect conversion can be obtained using only milliwatts of power. The theory is verified by direct finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations of the nonlinear Maxwell equations, allowing for the design and evaluation of cavities in arbitrary geometries."}
{"text":"This paper explores the idea that Mott fermionic quantum criticality exists beyond the framework of Ginzburg-Landau-Wilson phase transition paradigms, proposing that such behavior is observed in low dimensional organic materials. We provide predictions for experimential measurements to test our hypothesis, finding agreement for an unexplained exponent amidst the violent disagreement of other critical exponents. We suggest that this Mott transition belongs to a new class of finite temperature quantum critical points, which incorporate quantum effects and cannot be exclusively addressed by traditional methods."}
{"text":"\nThe WMAP experiment has detected an anomalous amount of microwave emission from the vicinity of the center of our Galaxy. This signal, dubbed the ``WMAP Haze'', could be attributed to the synchrotron radiation emitted from the relativistic positrons and electrons created in dark matter annihilations. This letter explores the plausibility of this hypothesis and it has been found that the angular distribution of the WMAP Haze coincides with that of dark matter with a cuspy density profile, $\\rho(r) \\propto r^{-1.2}$ in the inner kiloparsecs. The intensity of the WMAP Haze implies a wide range of possible WIMP transmutation modes and masses ranging from 100 GeV to multi-TeV. Most significantly, the annihilation cross section must be equal to $\\sigma v \\sim 3 \\times 10^{-26}$ cm$^3$\/s, which is the value required to generate a thermal relic, without requiring any extra assistance. If dark matter annihilations are the actual cause of the WMAP Haze, GLAST would be able to identify gamma rays from the Galactic Center if the WIMP mass is below several hundred GeV."}
{"text":"\nBy leveraging advanced tools developed previously for classical numerical electromagnetism, we have created a method to calculate Casimir forces with arbitrary accuracy. Our approach involves computing the mean stress tensor for imaginary frequencies through the fluctuation-dissipation theorem and assessing its suitability for numerical calculation. We tested our scheme by examining its outcome for many different geometries and materials, including cylinders and plates. We also showed that the force between two squares and walls changes in a non-monotonic way when the squares are moved laterally in two and three dimensional setups. This can be achieved by relying on a finite-difference frequency-domain implementation."}
{"text":"\nThis work is part of the NUGA survey that examines the presence of molecular gas in nearby galaxies. In this paper, we analyse the observations of NGC4569, located in the Virgo Cluster, to investigate the correlation between the starburst at the nucleus and the molecular gas content. We find that 70% of the 1.1x10^9 Msolar of molecular gas detected in the inner 20\" is concentrated in the area of 800 pc or less and is evenly distributed along the long-scale stellar bar in the near-infrared images. The gap in the CO distribution matches the nucleus, where most of the Halpha and blue light emissions arise. To obtain better understanding of the galaxy's physical characteristics, we use three models to measure the kinematics of the gas: a pure geometrical one, one based on elliptical orbits, and one using analytical solutions of orbits in a slightly barred potential. We then calculate the mass inflow rate from the most accurate model. The data suggests that the gravitational tugs from the large scale bar can funnel gas from the inner Lindblad Resonance down to a distance of 300 pc. However, another mechanism may be necessary to fuel the starburst at 100 pc or less."}
{"text":"\nThis experiment examined how normal alkanols interact with the oil\/water interface using x-ray reflectivity and tensiometry. It demonstrated that transformation from a liquid to gas monolayer at the hexane\/water boundary can only happen for alkanols with longer chains. As the chain length decreases, the difference in excess surfactant's surface entropy per area weakens until it depletes. When the excess surface entropy is low, the interfacial layer is formed by multiple molecules rather than the monolayer which requires a high excess surface entropy. The analysis of n-hexane and n-hexadecane mapping also illustrated an alteration in interfacial structure due to surfactant, however, it did not affect the monolayer phase transition. The results point to the critical carbon number of the alkanol being 6 carbons more than the carbon number of the alkane solvent molecules."}

{"text":"\nThis study examines the effects of incoherent noise on an ensemble undergoing a sequence of unitary operations, as is relevant for quantum information processing. Measurement of expectation values reveals the presence of such incoherence and also its characteristics: it is mainly refocusable and, unlike decoherence, is either static or varies slowly with respect to control operations. By analyzing the fidelity decay under entangling maps, we identify distinguishable signs of incoherence in simulation and real-world experiments, carried out in this instance with a three qubit nuclear magnetic resonance system."}
{"text":"\nAstronomers have observed a strikingly bright transient source in the outer parts of the Messier 85 galaxy in the Virgo Cluster. In comparison to novae, this event had an outstanding peak absolute R magnitude of -12, and for a tidal disruption event in an old stellar population, it was fainter than a Type Ia supernova. Furthermore, archival images at the location of the transient had an upper brightness limit of -4.1, indicating that it was not an eruption from a luminous blue variable star. Watched over the course of 2 months, the transient emitted 110466 joules of energy and eventually dimmed in the opical sky.This was 6-times more intense than a similarly mysterious transient in M31, leading scientists to postulate that it may have been the result of a stellar merger. If this hypothesis is true, astronomers may be able to examine the physics behind extreme over-Eddington radiative emission and gain a better understanding of stellar binaries and their evolution."}
{"text":"This article contributes to the exploration of mechanical systems that admit a second invariant, quadratic in velocities, other than the Hamiltonian. Its focus lies in the construction and comprehensive tabulation of such systems defined through a scalar and vector potential playing a role in the Lagrangian function of the system. The resulting time-irreversible systems are explored in the configuration space of a 2D Riemannian or pseudo-Riemannian manifold where the analysis of their geometry is a part of the solution process. 41 integrable systems of this type are identified, including all known cases of motion of a particle in the plane and all known cases in the dynamics of a rigid body, most of them newly discovered by this study. Furthermore, several new cases of motion are identified on the sphere, the pseudo-sphere and the hyperbolic plane. The results of this article are applicable to a range of disciplines and its potential advantages are discussed."}
{"text":"\nThis research examines the power of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) when applied to rapidly-rotating white dwarf stars going through Accretion-Induced Collapse (AIC). Our simulations, using 2D multi-group flux-limited diffusion MHD, find that including MHD processes can create an explosion with a power of a few Bethe - up from a mere 0.1Bethe - and an ejecta mass of ~0.1Msun, compared to 0.001Msun without the addition of magnetic fields and stresses. The core is substantially spun down and the rotational energy is channeled into magnetic energy, producing a strong magnetically-driven wind instead of a weak one driven by neutrinos. This wind has too much baryon load to become relativistic, suggesting an unlikely GRB event to emerge. Our study also predicts low production of 56Ni, likely making this an optically-dark, adiabatically-cooled explosion, as well as an ejection of neutron-rich nuclei. We suggest that such highly-magnetized millisecond-period protoneutron stars may later form into magnetars, and that their magnetically-driven winds may transition to Poynting-flux-dominated, potentially detectable GRBs at cosmological distances. Nevertheless, the expectation of a low rate of AICs will limit them to a miniscule subset of GRB and\/or magnetar progenitors."}
{"text":"\nThe Spitzer IRAC (Infrared Array Camera) wide-field survey of the Coma cluster has revealed two fields with varying densities of ~29,200 sources when observed with 70-90 second exposures. Analysis of the 3.6 micron galaxy luminosity functions (LFs) show that both fields have a traditional Schechter function at the bright end, but a steep increase in slope at the faint end (M(3.6 micron) >-20.5), which is more pronounced in the off-center Coma 3 field. Comparison with optical LFs from B- and R-band reveals a larger population of faint dwarf galaxies, which may be low-surface-brightness or too red to be seen in most optical surveys. These findings uncover the near-IR dwarf galaxy population of the Coma cluster."}
{"text":"\nIn the witness-based approach, data fusion results received from randomly chosen sensor nodes are voted on by the base station and other sensor nodes, termed 'witnesses', to ensure accuracy. However, the chosen node could forge the vote if compromised. To reduce the power consumption of the chosen node, this article proposes an improved direct voting mechanism where the witness node sends the vote directly to the base station. Thus, forgery is no longer a problem but fewer bits are needed to represent the vote, drastically decreasing power consumption in comparison with the witness-based approach. Performance evaluation and simulation results have shown that the direct voting mechanism could yield a 40-fold improvement in overhead when compared to the witness-based approach."}
{"text":"\nWe present evidence for faint HI 21-cm emission line wings at velocities which are beyond what is expected from Galactic rotation in the Galactic plane. Named forbidden-velocity wings (FVWs), we have identified 87 of these protruding regions of excessive emission which are enclosed in limited spatial regions of less than 2 degrees and have velocity extents which exceed 20 km\/s on a large scale. Most of these FVWs, 85%, have no spatial correlation with known supernova remnants, galaxies, or high velocity clouds. We suspect that many are likely fast-moving HI shells and filaments that are associated with ancient supernova remnants which are otherwise invisible. Additionally, we discuss other potential explanations for the presence of these FVWs."}
{"text":"\n\nThis reveals the existence of a 'sweet spot' in the realm of supersymmetric theories, where the gravitino mass is of order 1 GeV. This implies natural explanations to major problems encountered in supersymmetric theories related to flavor\/CPity, mu-problem, cosmological moduli\/gravitino problems, and dimension four\/five proton decay. Furthermore, the cosmic abundance of non-thermally produced gravitinos accurately describes the quantity of dark matter in the universe. Additionally, there exists a mild hierarchy between the mass scale of the supersymmetric particles and electroweak scale, which is consistent with the null result of Higgs boson search at the LEP-II experiments. A possible connection to the strong CP problem is also mentioned. The parameters are specified in such a manner that scalar tau lepton is the next lightest supersymmetric particle in the favored region of the parameter space and its lifetime is of about 1000 seconds; thus serving as a charged stable particle, which can be detected amidst other signatures in collider experiments. To this aim, we further draw out techniques for confirming this class of theories at the LHC experiments."}
{"text":"\nThis paper reviews the observational programs carried out as part of the SIM PlanetQuest Key project aimed at locating giant gas planets around young stars. TO reduce potential sources of astrometric noise that could hinder planet detection, studies involving photometry, high contrast imaging, interferometry and radial velocity have been conducted on stars in both the northern and southern hemispheres. High contrast imaging in Taurus and the Pleiades failed to detect any potential companions within a 140 AU radius of the SIM targets, while radial velocity surveys revealed a few possible sub-stellar companions in Taurus and the Pleiades. Imaging of certain stars in Taurus with interferometry showed no signs of stellar or sub-stellar companions closer than 5 mas. The photometric survey also estimated that about half of the initially chosen stars possess a degree of variability (with 1 sigma>0.1 mag) that would impede the requisite precision for detecting astrometry. We present a list of all targets assessed according to the outcomes of the current observational program, demonstrating that variability to any considerable degree proves to be the leading factor in eliminating stars from the SIM-YSO program."}
{"text":"\nThe goal of this research is to develop a stochastic Hebbian learning model which incorporates firing rate homeostasis as well as a critical connectivity state. This model is then assessed for stability and connectivity properties and is tested under simulated seizure and acute deafferentation conditions. It is hypothesized that neurological systems which maintain an overly connected critical state are more prone to become epileptogenic. Our research proposes that post-seizure and post-deafferentation states should be excessively connected, putting them at greater risk of epileptogenesis, whereas increases in spontaneous activity should serve as a buffer against epileptogenesis."}
{"text":"\nIn this article, we look into the polarization properties of primordial\ngravitational waves (GWB) embedded in cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies.

{"text":"This article offers a review of recent research into the potential fluctuations of fundamental constants such as atomic clocks, quasar absorption spectra, and Oklo natural nuclear reactor data. Assessing linear variability with time, comparative studies from quasar absorption data suggest $\\dot{\\mu}\/\\mu=(1 \\pm 3) \\times 10^{-16}$ yr$^{-1}$ and the best limit of $\\dot{\\alpha}\/\\alpha=(-0.8 \\pm 0.8) \\times 10^{-16}$ yr$^{-1}$ came from both quasar absorption data and atomic clocks. The Oklo natural reactor results in the strongest limit on the variantion of $m_s\/\\Lambda_{QCD}$ with the strange quark mass. It is also possible for large enhancement of relative variation effects to occur in atomic, molecular and nuclear transitions between close energy levels, in cold atomic and molecular collisions near Feshbach resonance, and in massive bodies such as stars and galaxies whose Coulomb-like scalar field produces a proportionate variation of constants. Following the comparison of these various phenomenon, the strongest limit of $k_\\alpha +0.17 k_e= (-3.5\\pm 6) \\times 10^{-7}$ could be inferred."}

{"text":"\nThe unique properties of Anomalous X-ray Pulsars (AXPs) have led to the belief that they sustain some of the strongest magnetic fields in the cosmos. To date, an accurate reading of the surface field intensities has been elusive. Similarly, it has not been clear whether these objects experience outbursts due to their fields or the properties of the neutron star's crust. In this article, a precise surface magnetic field strength is measured for AXP XTE J1810$-$197, confirming its magnetar nature. Analysis and modeling of the source yielded a value of B = (2.72$\\pm$0.03)$\\times10^{14}$ G, remarkably close to that predicted by the rate of spindown from numerous observations over varying flux intensities. Notably, the surface temperature of this AXP steadily decreased after a 2003 outburst. Our findings provide evidence of energy footprints from the AXP's magnet and illustrate the transient behavior of this class of neutron stars."}

{"text":"\nThis article explores the hypothesis that the Big Bang began with the release of photons at extremely high energy levels contained in the 3-dimensional space $w^2 + x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = R_i^2$. It argues that the wavelength of the zero-point radiation from quantum fluctuations is inversely proportional to the curvature of the space, and its quantum of wavelength is consistent. As a result, the total energy of this radiation in the Universe remains unchanged, and its expansion is regulated by a tension intensity proportional to the curvature of space. This leads to an everlasting Universe with no Big Crunch, where the initial radius of the Universe $R_i$ must have been lesser than the Schwarzschild radius $R_s$ for the matter generation to take place over extended periods. Should the $R_i$ exceed the $R_s$ mark, the mass of the Universe, $M_u$ would have needed to be much greater for the right period of matter generation."}
{"text":"\nIn this paper, we analyze a spatial version of the classical model of phytoplankton-zooplankton interactions proposed by Scheffer [M Scheffer, Fish and nutrients interplay determines algal biomass: a minimal model, Oikos \\textbf{62} (1991) 271-282]. We extend the model by including external periodic forces, noise, and diffusion processes. Our results show that this spatially extended system presents resonance patterns and frequency-locking phenomena. Moreover, we demonstrate that external periodic forces induce the appearing of 4:1 and 1:1 frequency-locking and spatially homogeneous oscillations while noise is found to enhance the oscillations of the phytoplankton species' density and create large clusters in the space. Furhtermore, the numerical calculation obtained with the help of the Maple software suggests that the 4:1 frequency-locking can transform into 1:1 frequency-locking when the noise intensity increases. Our findings are also out of the scope of Turing instability. Consequently, we can deduce that random fluctuations may play a significant role in regulating oceanic plankton blooms, in contrast to the deterministic factors."}
{"text":"\nUsing the Plateau de Bure Interferometer (PdBI), this paper provides detailed high angular resolution imaging of the warm circumstellar material around three intermediate-mass (IM) stars.

Previous work by Carlen, Carvalho and Loss used a method that related the spectral properties of the transition operator to those of a simpler operator by utilizing non-commuting projections, as well as an inductive argument. Here, we develop a new approach which applies to many high-dimensional stochastic processes and uses deep results on Jacobi polynomials to study the spectral information of the transition operator. We also use this to obtain new bounds on Jacobi polynomials."}
{"text":"This article presents a new, generalized model of the Tonks-Girardeau gas, which consists of cold two-level Bosons interacting with external fields and among themselves in a Ramsey interferometer. We analyze the quantum effects and resulting Ramsey fringes and quantum projection noise, showing that these effects remain largely unaltered in the presence of interactions. Additionally, we examine the behavior of the dual system - an ideal gas of two-level Fermions interacting with fields - and empirically deduce that the number of particles generally does not have a great impact on the broadening of fringes. Lastly, we demonstrate that precision in the measurement of atomic transition frequency increases with the inverse root of the number of particles."}
{"text":"Motivated by Tantalo's Planarity Game, we examine the obfuscation complexity of planar graphs, where $obf(G)$ is defined as the maximum number of edge crossings in a drawing of a planar graph $G$. We consider the correlation between the obfuscation complexity and the vertex degree distribution of $G$, demonstrating an effective way to construct a drawing of $G$ with at least $obf(G)\/3$ crossings. We present upper and lower bounds of $\\obf G$ for $n$-vertex planar graphs $G$ with minimum vertex degree $\\delta(G) \\geq 2$. Additionally, we investigate the shift complexity of $G$, denoted by $shift(G)$, which is the minimum number of vertex shifts needed to eliminate all edge crossings in a drawing of $G$. Additionally, we illustrate that it is NP-hard to find the optimal sequence of shifts which makes a drawing $D$ crossing-free."}
{"text":"\nThe purpose of this paper is to analyze the expressive power of results that have been proven in the past relating to the complexity and evaluation of polynomials associated with problems such as the permanent and hamiltonian polynomials. Specifically, we compare the complexity of such polynomials when the underlying matrix has a bounded rank to that of matrices with a bounded treewidth structure. Further, we look at the implications of Kasteleyn's theorem, which states that the sum of weights of perfect matchings of a planar graph can be computed in polynomial time and thus is of VP complexity.  Our results show that the permanent and hamiltonian polynomials of matrices of bounded treewidth are equivalent to arithmetic formulas, and additionally, arithmetic weakly skew circuits are equivalent to the sum of weights of perfect matchings of planar graphs."}
{"text":"\nThe aim of this research is to explore the habitability of the two super-Earths in the Gliese 581 system (Gl 581b, c and d) with regard to providing a long term mechanism for producing photosynthetic biomass.

Models with different land to ocean ratios are included in the study. Gl 581c is found to be outside of the habitable zone, whereas Gl 581d is found to be at the outer boundary of the zone and as such, is potentially habitable. Despite the poor conditions on this planet, primitive forms of life may prior on the surface and it is therefore an ideal target for upcoming missions aiming to search for biomarkers."}
{"text":"\nThis paper presents a modified cable formalism which captures the behavior of neuronal membranes at high frequencies by introducing non-ideal capacitors into cable equations. Solutions of the resulting model are formulated analytically using Fourier transforms and validated with numerical simulation of a ball-and-stick model. Results show that membrane potential activity displays similar frequency scaling to that evidenced in in vivo experiments, with a slope of approximately -2.5. Additionally, this modified cable formalism yields important implications for properties such as the transmission of high frequencies, which is enhanced, and voltage attenuation in dendrites. Consequently, this model may offer a better representation of neuronal behavior in vivo compared to traditional methods."}
{"text":"\nThis article examines the phenomenon of non-extractable (bound) entanglement in real many-body systems. We analyze two types of systems - harmonic oscillator chains and spin-1\/2 chains - that are at thermal equilibrium and possess few interaction parameters. Examining the amount of negatability for a variety of divisions of the system shows us the presence of non-extractable entanglement at certain temperatures. Additionally, we analyze how this bound entanglement is represented in entanglement-area laws. Our investigations of different interactions and topologies confirm that bound entanglement is a general feature of these systems; in particular, thermally bound entanglement exists in harmonic chain systems with an arbitrary number of particles. Finally, there is evidence that this effect carries over to the vast majority of spin-1\/2 systems even in the macroscopic limit."}
{"text":"\nThe properties of Bose-Einstein-condensed gases when placed in random potentials of any strength are thoroughly investigated here by the use of a stochastic mean-field approach. It is evidenced that even for very weak interactions and highly disruptive disorders, the superfluid fraction may be less than the condensate fraction. The condensate, superfluid and glassy fractions all exist concurrently and shift between being non-zero and zero in varying degrees of disorder. As disorder is increased, the condensate fraction also exhibits an excessive repulsion effect caused by the competition between interaction strength and disorder. This culminates in a first-order phase transition at a critical value of disorder, leading all fractions to zero."}
{"text":"This article investigates the phenomenon of 'blow-up' when working with the parabolic scalar curvature equation. The equation is defined by a function $R$ on $[r_0,r_1)\\times\\Sigma$ and a family of metrics $\\gamma(r)$ on $\\Sigma$. The equation has solutions in the form of metrics of prescribed scalar curvature $R$ on $[r_0,r_1)\\times\\Sigma$, however, the physically interesting case of $R>0$ often leads to blow-up in finite time, with $r_1 < \\infty$. The article seeks to examine the situation in which the blow-up still takes place, but the metric $g$ can be continuously extendible to $\\bar M=[r_0,r_1]\\times\\Sigma$ as a manifold with a totally geodesic outer boundary at $r=r_1$."}
{"text":"We explore the intriguing effects of superconductivity in MgB2 single crystals when confined to cylinders by a magnetic field which can be finely tuned. Measurements of reversible magnetization, taken in proximity to the zero field transition temperature, provide evidence of a 3D-xy critical behavior - consistent with that of 4He. This allows us to investigate the finite size effect imposed by the controlling magnetic field, and the resulting 3D-1D crossover line. Our results indicate that, inside this line and below the transition temperature, superconductivity is confined to the cylinders and that no continuous phase transition occurs along the H_c2-lines, as previously predicted."}
{"text":"\nA solar pore with a light bridge, located on the boundary between small magnetic elements and bigger sunspots, was studied using high resolution images from the Interferometric BI-dimensional Spectrometer (IBIS). This area was observed using monochromatic images in the Ca II 854.2 nm line and in the Fe I 709.0 nm line, as well as G-band and broad-band images. The fluctuations in Line of Sight velocity observed inside the pore were smaller than in a quiet photosphere nearby. Azimuthal average LoS velocity was then measured showing a downward velocity of -200 m\/s and an annular downward flow of -350 m\/s relative to the near quiet sun. Further examination of the light bridge with the broad-band channel of IBIS and the red wing of Ca II 854.2 nm line revealed the presence of an elongated dark structure along its axis, realised as a convective roll representing a weak upflow of 50-100 m\/s flanked by a downflow of -(200-300) m\/s."}
{"text":"\nThrough our model of the time-dependent metagalactic radiation field, we examined how the gamma-ray background from blazars is created. Using the luminosity functions of high- and low-peaked blazars and the derived spectral index of detected blazars, we discovered a low number (around 20) of nearby high-peaked blazars emitting a flux of over 10^-11cm^-2 s^-1 above 300 GeV. This outcome is supported by the results from air-Cherenkov telescope studies. By combining the gamma-ray emission from blazars at higher redshifts we estimated a maximum of 30% contribution to the extragalactic gamma-ray background from high-peaked blazars."}
{"text":"This article presents an analysis of Yukawa potentials in systems that only have partial periodic boundary conditions in two directions. Exploring the Ewald sum for these specific cases, we are able to gain insight into the Coulomb limit for Yukawa potentials and its dependency on the electroneutrality of the system. Furthermore, an accurate numerical technique is developed in order to accurately predict the behavior of the long-ranged potential in the presence of a small Debye screening length."}
{"text":"\nThis article presents an extension of the supersymmetric Pati-Salam model which can lead to a new shifted hybrid inflationary scenario, as well as a version of smooth hybrid inflation with only renormalizable interactions. These potentials possess valleys of minima with the capability to be utilized as inflationary paths and are compliant with the three-year Wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe data. Additionally, the breaking of the Pati-Salam gauge group down to the standard model during inflation ensures the lack of any monopoles at the end of inflation. Through a non-minimal Kaehler potential with a suitable sign supergravity corrections can be added to the inflationary path without creating maxima or minima, allowing for natural initial conditions for inflation."}
{"text":"This research offers new, concise foundations for establishing the four laws of thermodynamics, the Maxwell relationships, and the stability requirements of response functions, all in an applicable form to global, local and microlocal equilibrium. This work uses very little in the way of formality, remaining closely tied to the formulae used by professionals in the physics, chemistry, and engineering fields. Through a small set of assumptions, the full structure of phenomena-based thermodynamics and classical and quantum statistical mechanics is revealed. This paper is clear of the subjective elements that often manifest in information or probablitiy by concentrating solely on the static parts of classical and quantum statistical mechanics, which accommodate single object descriptions. When completed with traditional cases and applications, this work can be used as the base of a thermal physics course."}
{"text":"\nUsing VERA (VLBI Exploration of Radio Astrometry), multi-epoch VLBI observations of the 22GHz H2O masers in the Orion KL region were initially examined. Through phase-referencing VLBI astrometry, a yearly parallax of 2.29+\/-0.10 mas was observed, leading to a distance calculation of 437+\/-19 pc from the Sun. Although this is in agreement with the previously established 480+\/-80 pc, our results are more accurate with a lower uncertainty of 4%. Furthermore, an absolute proper motion was uncovered indicating a combination of an outflow motion associated with source I and its own systematic motion."}
{"text":"\nThis study conducted the first precision measurements of the Casimir-Lifshitz force between two metals immersed in a fluid. The forces observed were attractive, about 80% less than that of ideal metals in a vacuum. The obtained results support looking more closely at how repulsive forces between metals and dielectrics in non-vacuum medium can manifest, and examines how well the generalized Casimir-Lifshitz theory holds for these interactions. Experimental results indicating the behavior of the Casimir-Lifshitz forces in this particular situation are reported."}
{"text":"\nThe present work examines the cosmology of a form of modified gravity, namely a modified Gauss-Bonnet gravity, in which a function f(G) of the Gauss-Bonnet term G is included in the gravitational action to account for the accelerating expansion of the universe. To analyze this gravity, the covariant and gauge-invariant perturbation equations are derived. It is proven that these f(G) theories do not reproduce the LCDM model with Omega_DE = 0.76 without introducing a cosmological constant as a function of f(G). There are constrains posed on the functional form of f(G) due to the stability of early-time perturbation growth, and the stability of small-scale perturbations requires that f remain close to a constant. To illustrate this, a form of f(G) was used to reproduce the standard LCDM cosmic history. The results of this study imply that f(G) models must comply with a variety of restrictions to be in agreement with current cosmological data."}
{"text":"This paper explores the evolution of dust in the early universe, specifically examining its abundance in the galaxy SDSS J1148+5251. Using analytical models, we infer that supernovae must condense at least 1 Msun of dust to account for the observed dust mass in this quasar. If this turns out to be a standard dust yield, it would suggest an additional process such as grain accretion or condensation around an AGN are needed to account for the amount of dust. We also consider two possible star formation histories: an intensive, short burst lasting ~100 Myr or a more extended period at a much lower star formation rate."}
{"text":"\nWe present the results of a study of the luminous merging starburst system NGC 6052, which was observed with the Spitzer Space Telescope by both imaging and spectroscopy. The MIR spectra of the three brightest spatially resolved regions in the galaxy are found to be similar, suggesting the emission is coming from young and similar stellar populations which have formed within the past 6 million years. The analysis of the brightest region indicates that the temperature of the dust is lower than 200K, and therefore is likely in the form of a patchy screen of relatively cold material along the line of sight. Furthermore, the emission from both PAHs and the forbidden atomic lines appears very similar for each region. This suggests that the ionization regions are self-similar across the galaxy. The fourth observed region is seen to have MIR emission similar to tidal tail features in other interacting galaxies."}
{"text":"\nThis paper presents a comprehensive examination of the TeV J2032+4130 source,  identified by the HEGRA telescope in the direction of the Cygnus OB2 region, with deep radio imaging from the Giant Metre Wave Radio Telescope (GMRT) near Pune and the Very Large Array (VLA) in New Mexico as well as near infared observations from the Centro Astronomico Hispano Aleman (CAHA). We have detected 153 radio sources at 49cm within the GMRT antennae's primary beam with a full width half maximum of 43 arc-minutes, and can now observe the non-thermal extended emission of the source with improved angular resolution. This study updates the results of our previous paper, incorporating the results from Whipple and MILAGRO's latest TeV telescopy and provides further insight into the nature of TeV J2032+4130."}
{"text":"\nWe undertake an analysis of the theoretical status of the ratios of hadron lifetimes such as $ \\tau_{B^+} \/ \\tau_{B_d}$, $\\tau_{B_s} \/ \\tau_{B_d}$, $\\tau_{\\Lambda_b} \/ \\tau_{B_d}$ and $\\tau_{B_c}$, as well as the mixing parameters of $B_s$ mesons such as $\\Delta M_s$, $\\Delta \\Gamma_s$ and $\\phi_s$. The uncertainties of $\\Delta M_s$ and $\\Delta \\Gamma_s$ are high due to the unknown decay constants, however, the ratio between these two can be established without large non-perturbative uncertainty and can be used to detect potential new physics contributions. We consequently propose a method to visualise the bounds on new physics with the combination of the latest experimental measurements and theory calculations. While circumstantial evidence is present, further refinements are required to extract reliable conclusions. Finally, a ranking is provided of the quantities surveyed in order of their current theoretical uncertainty, and ways to improve these estimations are outlined."}
{"text":"\nThis paper presents a Bonami-Beckner hypercontractive inequality for matrix-valued functions on the Boolean cube. To prove this, we utilize an inequality by Ball, Carlen, and Lieb, as well as demonstrate a range of applications. Our spaces of interest are those in which $n$ classical bits are encoded into $m$ qubits, with a set of $k$ bits recoverable by a quantum measurement. Nayak's quantum random access code bound indicates that if $m<0.7n$, the success probability is exponentially small in $k$. This in turn provides a strong direct product theorem for the one-way quantum communication complexity of Disjointness and other problems. Additionally, we offer a classical proof for a result first derived by Kerenidis and de Wolf about the length of a locally decodable error-correcting code with two queries that is exponential in the encoded string length, answering a question by Trevisan."}
{"text":"\nWe explore the confinement mechanism of N=1 supersymmetric quantum chromodynamics (SQCD) by extending Seiberg's duality to include the effects of light, massive states. We consider a theory with U(N_c) gauge group and N_c + N quark flavors, where N_c of the flavors are massless and the others have small, equal masses. This acts as a mild deformation of Seiberg's duality, pushing the dynamical system into an asymptotically free regime instead of the usual infrared free system. The dual theory, then, consists of U(N) gauge theory with N+N_c flavors of \"dual quark\" fields, plus an additional gauge-singlet mesonic field M. Condensation of the \"dual quarks\" enables non-Abelian flux tubes, which, when interpreted in terms of the quark theory, are seen to carry chromoelectric fields. The flux tubes join at string junctions, which can be thought of as \"constituent quarks\" in the quark theory, and glueballs of the quark theory are formed by closed strings. Other string configurations consisting of two junctions connected by a pair of strings can also be interpreted as mesonic states of the same theory."}
{"text":"\nThe 5.4 kton MINOS detector located at the Soudan Underground Laboratory in Minnesota, USA has been observing cosmic ray muons since August 2003 at a depth of 2070 meters-water-equivalent. Reversing the magnetic field allowed two analyses to be combined and thereby reduced systematic errors while determining the charge ratio of underground muons, measured to be 1.374 +\/- 0.004 (stat.) +0.012 -0.010(sys.). Further analysis of the resulting data, in the energy range 1-7 TeV, showed the charge ratio is consistent with being energy independent at the two standard deviation level. Comparing the MINOS measurements to those at lower energies reveals a rise in the charge ratio between 0.3-1.0 TeV, possibly due to increasing kaon decays contributing to the charge ratio."}
{"text":"\nThis work studies the $R$ cut-off covering spectrum and the cut-off covering spectrum of complete length spaces and Riemannian manifolds. These spectra measure the sizes of localized holes in the space and are defined by utilizing $\\delta$ covers, $R$ cut-off $\\delta$ covers, and $\\delta$ homotopies where the squares of the homotopies are mapped into a ball of radius $\\delta$. Taking local compactness into consideration, we show that these new spectra are subsets of the closure of the length spectrum. The results also demonstrate that the pointed Gromov-Hausdorff convergence of spaces reveals the $R$ cut-off covering spectrum to be almost continuous, with the cut-off covering spectrum showing to possess a relatively well behaved property in contrast to the covering spectrum established in our earlier work. To end with, the spectra are analyzed on Riemannian manifolds with lower bounds on their sectional and Ricci curvature, and their corresponding limit spaces."}
{"text":"\nIn this paper, we utilize dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) along with numerical renormalization group (NRG) to analyze the local spectral densities of one- and two-particle response functions for the infinite-dimensional Hubbard model in a magnetic field. The regime of half-filling, near half-filling, and away from half-filling, for intermediate and strong $U$ values, is studied. Results suggest the existence of quasiparticles with field dependent parameters, which are quantified via two distinct numerical renormalization methods. After identifying the renormalized parameters, analysis of local longitudinal and transverse dynamic spin susceptibilities for an arbitrary field is successfully explained using the corresponding quasiparticles. Additionally, results show that Luttinger's theorem holds true in all regimes and all values of the magnetic field."}
{"text":"\nWe explore the impact of width and mean curvature flow in relation to closed geodesics on a homotopy $n$-sphere. By constructing a continuous one-parameter family of closed curves starting and ending at point curves, and pulling each curve tight in a continuous way while maintaining the sweepout, we demonstrate that a curve in the tightened sweepout whose length is close to the length of the longest curve in the sweepout is close to a closed geodesic. This observation enables us to bound the rate of change of the width, up to a negative constant, of a one-parameter family of convex hypersurface flows. Formulating a sharp estimate of the width, which is equivalent to the square of the length of the shortest closed curve needed to cover the manifold, leads to a sharp estimate for the extinction time of the flow. Our findings bear similarity to prior results of bounding the rate of the two-dimensional width for homotopy 3-spheres evolving by the Ricci flow, as demonstrated by Perelman, as well as to the related studies conducted by CM1 and CM2."}
{"text":"\nThis paper carries out a detailed investigation into the effects of numerical resolution, black hole spin, and inclination angle on the detectability of equal-mass, spinning binary black holes using matched filtering techniques, commonly employed in data analysis. Results from our study suggest that higher harmonics are necessary for accurate detection of spinning binary black holes and can become increasingly important as their spins increase. We also present a preliminary analysis on how well a template of fixed spin and inclination can detect signals of arbitrary spin and inclination by sticking to the axial case scanned in this research. Our findings demonstrate the importance of the parameter space explored by numerical relativity and its implications for the detection of gravitational waves and the subsequent parameter estimation of their sources."}
{"text":"\nThis article examines the oscillation effects of a supernova neutrino signal in terms of temporal variation. To do this, one and two dimensional hydrodynamical simulations are used to observe the changes to the induced neutrino flavor mixing due to modifications in the star's density profile. An S-Matrix Monte Carlo approach is then used to investigate the evolution in neutrino crossing probability. Lastly, we analyze the spectra of positrons within a water Cerenkov detector and the ratio of charged current to neutral current events in a heavy water detector, lending insight into numerous features of the explosion."}
{"text":"\nIn this article, we present the observation that Cooper pairs can have a more diversified outcome than BCS or helium models indicate. We examine copper-oxide d-wave superconductors and show that as the doping volume is reduced, the Cooper pairs require an intensified diamagnetic aspect and a strong but momentary superconducting order. At extreme underdoping, Cooper pairs are \"disintegrated\" and charge is detached from spin-singlet bonds, causing two pseudogaps to emerge. The resultant state is more reliant on diagonal correlations than superconducting off-diagonal ones. This theory is used to analyze and form conclusions about the phase diagram from various recent experiments."}
{"text":"\nThis paper investigates the link between the halos hosting the earliest PopIII stars and the rare, massive halos that are generally found to hold the bright quasars at great redshift z~6. We aim to answer whether the supermassive black holes powering these QSOs come from the seeds of intermediate mass black holes created by the initial PopIII stars. To do so, we combine N-body simulations of structure formation to select the most massive halos present at z~6 and a Monte Carlo technique based on linear theory to spot the locations and emergence times of the initial light halos inside the entire simulation space. We discover that the progenitors of the first ~10^6 Msun of the halos at z~6 do not, typically, end up in the most massive ones, but inhabit a wide array of environments. On the other hand, the most ancient PopIII forerunners of the most massive z~6 halos originate from peaks approximately one and a half standard deviations more common than the first PopIII star formed in the area of a single luminous high-z QSO. Furthermore, intermediate mass black hole seeds made by the earliest PopIII stars at z>40 can quickly grow to m_BH>10^9.5 Msun by z=6, so long as Eddington accretion with a radiative efficiency of \\epsilon~0.1 is assumed. However, this growth must be stopped by other means, like quenching the black hole's accretion, to keep away a surplus of supermassive black holes at lower redshift. This is achievable if we limit the mass accretion to a fraction, \\eta~6*10^{-3, of the full baryon mass of the halo in which the black hole is situated. This supplies us with a high-end slope of \\alpha ~ -3.7 for the black hole mass function, fitting within 1\\sigma of the observed quasar luminosity function at z=6."}
{"text":"\nWe explore the implications of Randall-Sundrum radion in realistic warped space models, which include bulk gauge and fermion fields. We focus on the coupling of the radion to massless gauge fields (such as photons and gluons) due to the possibility of loop effects. We explain the couplings from the viewpoint of the conformal field theory. Using the obtained couplings, we calculate the radion decay branching fractions and the possibility for its detection at the LHC. In particular, we find that gamma spectra from the radion is enhanced from the ones from the Standard Model Higgs when the Randall-Sundrum scale is low. This signal can be amplified or suppressed depending on the size of the brane-localized kinetic terms. We depict the possibility to discover the radion through the four lepton channel in the case of larger radion masses."}
{"text":"This article finds that Supernova 1987A (SN 1987A) reveals a connection between the supernova, gamma-ray bursts, and the majority of massive stars with peculiar (MSP) deaths. SN 1987A is seen as a \u2018Rosetta Stone\u2019 because it likely occurred due to the merger of two stellar cores of a common envelope (CE) binary, which is a \u201cdouble-degenerate\u201d (DD)-initiated supernova. It is argued that SN 1987A demonstrates the potential for a long gamma-ray burst upon hitting polar ejecta, coming from the beam\/jet (BJ) released from the DD merger. Moreover, the ionization from the particles from the BJ hitting the PE is linked to an upper limit of 5x10^40 ergs\/sec. Such observations imply that DD must be the dominant SN mechanism in elliptical galaxies and subsequent sGRB production without CE or PE. Last, SN 1987A indicates a possible systematic effect in Ia cosmology as Ia\u2019s will appear to be Ic\u2019s when viewed from their DD merger poles. Overall, this article puts into perspective the range of implications that SN 1987A has on connecting mass stars to their peculiar deaths and GRBs."}
{"text":"\nThrough 8.4GHz very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observation of type II-P supernova SN2004et in NGC 6946, we were able to measure an isotropic luminosity at 8.4GHz of (4.45$\\pm$0.3)$\\times10^{25}$ erg s$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1}$, and a brightness temperature of (1.3$\\pm$0.3)$\\times10^{8}$ K. Model fitting of the size of the radio emission gave an estimated minimum expansion velocity of 15,700$\\pm$2,000 km s$^{-1}$. This is more than twice the estimated mean expansion velocity from a synchrotron self-absorbed emission model, indicating that such a model is not applicable for this supernova. From an optical spectrum twelve days after explosion, we propose an emission model made up of two hot spots on an expanding shell of comparable width to SN 1993J."}
{"text":"The interaction of a gas cloud situated near a supernova remnant (SNR) with particles escaping from the SNR's shock, sets the stage for gamma-ray emission through neutral pion decay. In stead of the commonly-made assumption of a power law spectrum for the accelerated particles of an SNR, this study recognizes that if the cloud is at a certain distance from the SNR, then the escaping particles should have a monoenergetic spectrum, that weakens in strength as the SNR ages. Research presented in this paper suggests the gamma-ray spectrum, in the range of energies recognizable by GLAST, would be flatter than expected, with the cutoff being reliant on the pion momentum distribution in the laboratory frame. Applied to the VHE diffuse emission detected by HESS in the Milky Way's centre, this study presents insight into the behavior of the flux of particles escaping from an SNR shock."}
{"text":"\nBy analyzing five AM CVn stars with the Fine Guidance Sensors aboard the Hubble Space Telescope, we present the absolute parallaxes and relative proper motions. The resulting distances suggest a much lower space density of AM CVn stars than previously assumed. Further, based on the mass accretion rates, we conclude that the donor stars in all systems but GP Com possess semi-degenerate, relatively massive masses. Finally, we assess the strength of the output gravitational-wave signals which arise from these distances combined with the theorized masses of each binary component. Our findings point to all systems save GP Com as excellent possibilities for detection with the proposed Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA)."}
{"text":"\nThis paper discusses the gamma-ray albedo of the Moon, which pertains to the interaction of cosmic-ray nuclei with the moon rock. This study employed a Monte Carlo simulation via the GEANT4 framework, which agrees with existing EGRET data. Gamma ray flux from the Moon exhibits an effective cutoff around 4 GeV (600 MeV for inner regions), which having an understood normalisation, provides an ideal standard for gamma-ray telescopes such as GLAST. Additionally, these albedo fluxes are dependent on incident cosmic ray spectra and are therefore potentially suitable for measuring these spectra. By combining PAMELA data with GLAST LAT observations, it is possible to make extended studies of CR spectra near Earth, including long term monitoring of any changes over the solar cycle."}
{"text":"\nIn this article, the PHOBOS experiment utilizes data gathered from collisions between sqrt(s_NN) of 20 and 200 GeV to illustrate the production of soft particles and the existing scalings. The study has been aided by the inclusion of new data taken from Cu+Cu collisions plus new analyses of Au+Au events, including peripheral collisions. To further understand particle production at RHIC, two-particle correlations, rare event searches, and the analysis of particles emitted at forward rapidity have been applied. Here, we provide an overview of the results and their implications for data at the LHC."}
{"text":"\nThis paper presents an alternative to the traditional transistor-based architecture for connecting logic devices, inductive coupling through a ferromagnetic film. By utilizing spin waves propagating in the film, also known as the spin wave bus, information is transmitted wirelessly between distant devices. We experimentally demonstrate the 100nm thick NiFe and CoFe film at room temperature and use numerical modeling based on the experimental data to examine the device's performance. The data denotes that this approach can resolve the interconnect problem, offer wireless read-in and read-out, and increase the functionality of logic gates through the coupling between circuits and the spin wave bus. As a result, NOT, AND, and OR gates can be combined in one device structure. Numerical simulations illustrate the controllable switching of bi-stable logic cells with inductive coupling. The paper discloses some of the shortcomings and limitations of circuits with spin wave bus."}
{"text":"\nUsing the Chandra archive, we studied the temperature and metallicity profiles in 12 galaxy clusters located between 0.1 and 0.3 redshifts. We divided the sample into 7 Cooling-Core (CC) clusters and 5 Non-Cooling-Core (NCC) clusters according to their central cooling time. Single power-laws successfully described the temperature and metallicity profiles beyond 0.1 r_180 for both CC and NCC clusters, whereas a deviation occurred in the inner 0.1 r_180. Comparisons between our results and those of a local BeppoSAX sample showed general agreement. Additionally, a strong correlation was found between the power-law slope of kT(r) within 0.1 r_180 and the ratio between the cooling time and the age of the Universe at the cluster redshift, respectively 0 and 0.6 in CC clusters."}
{"text":"\nThe investigation of the thermoelectricity of strongly correlated electron systems is of great importance both from fundamental and technological points of view. This article focuses on the thermoelectric effects of the t-J model on a two-dimensional triangular lattice. Using exact diagonalization of the finite size model, the thermopower, Lorenz number, and the dimensionless figure of merit are determined by computational dynamical thermal response functions. Further, the results discussed in this study demonstrate the viability of the high-frequency formalism proposed by Shastry for the same thermodynamic properties. The thermopower of the geometrically frustrated lattice is found to have a significant mid-temperature rise when the sign of the hopping parameter $t$ is changed from positive to negative."}
{"text":"\nThis article studies the control theory of discrete-time Lagrangian or Hamiltonian systems, also known as discrete control systems. Geometric integrators, a type of numerical integration method, are examined to understand their properties, such as conservation of symplectic form, momentum, and energy, as well as how the discrete flow remains on the manifold of the system's continuous evolution. Nonlinear control techniques are employed for stability, controllability, and optimization, and their aspects of geometry and mechanics are thoroughly analyzed. To deal with this deficiency of the conventional numerical schemes not considering the underlying geometry, this field will focus on changes to the discrete-time model and associated control theory that preserves this important structure. As a result, these methods can produce numerical implementations of both nonlinear and geometric control algorithms with the same underlying geometry as the continuous system."}
{"text":"\nThis article explores the development of a microphysical model of early evolution, which relates the phenotypic lifespan of an organism to its genotype, i.e. the stability of its proteins. Through extensive computer simulations, the study demonstrates how the Big Bang phenomenon, wherein exponential population growth occurs following the discovery of advantageous genomic structures, is followed by a rapid coalescence of diverse protein structures into a limited number of preferred forms. It is suggested that the variables affected by evolutionary time scales - the discovery of folds, creation of new sequences and formation of species - leads to the emergence of distinct gene families, whose sizes are documented as being in line with those of real proteins. Further, the authors present a theory linking the stability of evolving proteins and the associated genome size. In sum, the article provides an insightful and microscopic view into the foundations of early evolutionary processes."}
{"text":"This paper examines the anomalies and de Sitter radiation of generic black holes in de Sitter spaces. By considering the Robinson-Wilczek result concerning the equivalent form between energy momentum tensor fluxes at the event horizon of Schwarzschild-type black holes and (1+1)-dimensional blackbody radiation, the method of anomaly cancellation is used to study Hawking radiation from the cosmological horizons of the general Schwarzschild-de Sitter and Kerr-de Sitter black holes. We find that for the anomaly cancelling to work, the effective field theory for the generic black holes must be formulated in the region between the two horizons, which allows for integration of classically irrelevant ingoing and outgoing modes."}
{"text":"\n\n\nThis study investigates the two-dimensional arrangement of atoms at the surface of liquid sodium through ab initio molecular dynamics simulations based on density functional theory. Our results show that the atoms of the liquid form a distorted hexagonal structure, with most of them being 5-fold coordinated, although there are fractions of 4-fold and 6-fold coordinated atoms. As the temperature is lowered towards solidification, there is a movement towards the angles corresponding to a six-fold coordinated hexagonal arrangement of atoms. We compare the liquid surface results to classical MD simulations of the liquid surface, noticing similar effects, and to ab initio MD simulations of a model solid-liquid interface, where a pronounced shift towards hexagonal ordering is observed due to decreasing temperature."}
{"text":"\nIn this article, we build on the existing knowledge of the Dirac-Coulomb equation, which typically entails disregarding the size of the atomic nucleus, to create a new exact solution which accounts for a nucleus of definite size. Previous rough expressions of the boundary condition had resulted in divergent wave functions and virtual energies when the charges of the nucleus are greater than 137. This, in turn, predicted an atom in ground state undergoing a rapid collapse to the state of a neutron-like particle. However, by forming an exact boundary condition for the hydrogen and hydrogen-like atoms, we have generated a solution for the radial Dirac-Coulomb equation which is free of any mathematical or physical difficulties. To our surprise, the K value as determined by Dirac is shown to be ultimately determined by the barrier width or the radius of the nucleus, and is not dependant upon the quantum energy. Consequently, a novel formula for the energy levels in a Coulomb field is produced, differentiating itself from the Dirac formula of the energy levels."}
{"text":"\nThe task of understanding the source of energy for corrosive mass ejections (CMEs) - solar explosions - commonly points to a buildup of magnetic free energy in the corona. With flux rope catastrophe model proposed as an explanation, the energy can be abruptly emitted either by magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) catastrophe, a global magnetic instability, or through reconnection of magnetic lines in the solar wind or existing electrical current sheets. This study examines the effects of allowing or prohibiting reconnection in the eruption of magnetic flux rope in the corona and in the solar wind. It is found that CMEs can be produced without the reconnection portion of the eruption, yet the speed of the risen can be accelerated with reconnection. The speed of the eruption can also be influenced by the strength of the background magnetic field, where fast and slow CMEs may have the same driving mechanism."}
{"text":"This research study looks into the possible processes of magnetic energy release that lead to solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) in the solar corona. It is suggested that systems containing a flux rope within a background field experience catastrophic breakdown, leading to an abrupt release of free energy in the corona, which is thought to cause CMEs at least in their initial stages. This rapid energy release is associated with an ideal MHD process, in contrast to nonideal processes like magnetic reconnection. Current sheets are formed as a result which are believed to be connected to flares accompanying CMEs, and which can act to further accelerate the CME. Future research on the combined roles of MHD catastrophes and magnetic reconnection in relation to CMEs and flares are proposed."}
{"text":"\nWe focus on the analysis of the double differential transverse-momentum (q_T) and rapidity (y) distribution of a Higgs boson in hadronic collisions from the process of gluon fusion. The small q_T region is better understood by accounting for the logarithmic contributions that arise from multiparton radiations to all orders. We use an approach to factorize the kinematic constraints of both transverse- and longitudinal-momentum conservation with the aid of the impact parameter and corresponding Mellin moments. We then go on to accurately resum to exponential form the logarithmic corrections. All-order resummation is conducted up to next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy covering up to high-order logarithmic terms within the small q_T regime. To accurately represent the large q_T region, a matching process is set-up to give the cross-section an accurate next-to-leading order in the high q_T zone. Results and discussion are presented for differential cross section in q_T and y at the LHC, and remarks are made on the comparison of the q_T cross section integrated over y."}
{"text":"This paper examines the compatibility of the thick brane model with recent observational evidence related to the accelerating expansion of the universe. Data from the Supernova Type Ia Gold sample, Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS), WMAP observations, and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) are used to constrain the free parameters of the codimension-1 model. To check its consistency with the universe's age, we compare it to the age of different cosmological objects. The combination of observations from the Gold sample, CMB shift parameter, and SDSS indicates a spatially open universe with $\\Omega_k=0.21_{-0.08}^{+0.08}$ at the 68% level of confidence. However, the same combination of observations with SNLS supernova observation suggests a spatially open universe $\\Omega_k=0.11_{-0.07}^{+0.10}$ which does not agree with recent WMAP data indicating a flat universe."}
{"text":"This paper presents a contextual probabilistic model which uses a language of wave functions instead of propositions to provide a quantum-like representation of macroscopic configurations. The proposed algorithm, QLRA, is capable of mapping probabilistic data to a complex or hyperbolic Hilbert space. It can be used to illustrate the mystical features of quantum mechanics regarding the behavior of macroscopic systems, and to potentially find applications in the fields of biology, sociology, and psychology."}
{"text":"This study presents a novel methodology for accurate measurement of the radial velocities of brown dwarfs and cool stars using near infrared spectra acquired by the Gemini-South Phoenix instrument. The technique is based on the I2 absorption cell method with telluric CH4 features used as a wavelength reference for determining the Doppler shifts of the CO and H2O features in the target spectra. Simulations were conducted to assess the achievable precision and showed that the performance was limited by the signal-to-noise of the data. Estimates of the rotational velocities and systemic velocities of the nine L dwarfs tested were obtained, with the ability to detect companions of M sin i > 2MJ in orbits with periods less than three days. No companions were identified in the sample, but further observations with higher signal-to-noise should lead to radial velocity precision of 100 m\/s for L dwarfs."}
{"text":"\nThis paper examines the implications of avoiding the Axiom of Choice for deriving the equations of motion for Einstein gravity. A topological manifold Q is provided, which contains all considered three-space regions and produces an equation of motion whose solutions are related to curvature and the source term through the topology of Q. This implies that GR is determined by this topological structure and is self-consistent in the sense that solutions to the equation of motion give a three-space region its physical, distinguishing geometry in four-dimensional spacetime. In addition, Q and q provide a structure for how to choose a three-space region without regard to any prior knowledge of its geometry. This presents us with the possibility of gaining further physical insight into GR, as well as exploring possible connections between this and holography."}
{"text":"Because of its location in an Earth-trailing orbit, Spitzer can make very precise microlens parallax measurements. Microlens parallaxes allow us to discern different populations, and by looking at the directions of the Magellanic Clouds (LMC\/SMC) and the Galactic bulge, these parallaxes would reveal the nature of the lenses in this area (whether they are dark halo or LMC\/SMC stars). Cool Spitzer has already made one such measurement of a bright source, but Warm Spitzer could focus on fainter ones and make around 24 parallaxes per year. This data would give us a much clearer picture of the disk's mass function and could even give us information on old brown dwarfs. Target-of-opportunity observations should be split into regular and disruptive observations, as pioneered by the Space Interferometry Mission. LMC\/SMC parallax measurements would be considered disruptive while those conducted in the bulge could be done in advance without knowing which star was being observed."}
{"text":"\nIn this article, we investigate one of the bulk viscosity coefficients of a cold CFL quark matter in the temperature regime where the contributions of mesons, quarks, and gluons to transport phenomena are Boltzmann suppressed. In this temperature regime, dissipation is the result of the collision between superfluid phonons, which are the Goldstone modes associated with the spontaneous breaking of baryon symmetry. This paper provides a review of the hydrodynamics of relativistic superfluids and explains that there are at least three bulk viscosity coefficients in these systems. We then analyze the bulk viscosity coefficient from the normal fluid component of the superfluid by utilizing Son's effective field theory. This theory is amended to account for scaling effects that are proportional to the square of the strange quark mass, m_s. We find that the bulk viscosity coefficient is 0.011 m_s^4\/T and it increases at lower temperatures until the phonon fluid description stops working. This study is applicable for understanding the rotational properties of a dense star that is formed from CFL quark matter."}
{"text":"\nIn this study, we explore the two potential explanations for the puzzle of the roughly equal fraction of transverse and longitudinal decays of the $B\\to \\phi K^*$ ($\\btos$) correspondences: penguin annihilation and rescattering. We analyze the expected results of each option for $\\fTfL$ in $\\btod$ decays and assess two promising U-spin related pairs of decays, $B^+ \\to K^{*0} \\rho^+$ ($\\btos$) and $B^+ \\to \\Kbar^{*0} K^{*+}$ ($\\btod$), and  $\\bs \\to K^{*0} \\Kbar^{*0}$ ($\\btos$) and $\\bd \\to \\Kbar^{*0} K^{*0}$ ($\\btod$). The comparison of these pairs of decays can be used to assess the validity of penguin annihilation and rescattering as an explanation for the observed polarization puzzle. Moreover, the time-dependent angular analysis of $\\bd \\to \\Kbar^{*0} K^{*0}$ decays offers a potential way to discriminate between the two options."}
{"text":"\nThis work presents the results of a deep survey of 162 Ly-alpha emission-line galaxies at a redshift of 3.1 in the Extended Chandra Deep Field South. The galaxies were identified by utilizing a narrow-band 5000 Anstrom filter and complementary broadband photometric data from the MUSYC survey with a monochromatic flux brighter than 1.5 x 10^-17 ergs cm^-2 s^-1 and an observers frame equivalent width exceeding 80 Angstroms. The equivalent width distribution follows an exponential with a rest-frame scale length of 76 Angstroms and a faint-end power-law slope of -1.49 observed at a space density of 1.46 x 10^-3 h70^3 galaxies Mpc^-3. In addition, the star-formation rates derived from Ly-alpha are ~3 times lower than that calculated from the rest-frame UV continuum, leading us to deduce the presence of internal extinction within the galaxies. This, combined with the lack of extremely-high equivalent width emitters, suggests these galaxies are young, relatively chemically unevolved, and likely not primordial Pop III objects."}
{"text":"\nThis paper focuses on Leonard pairs associated with a vector space of finite positive dimension, denoted by $V$. We consider two linear transformations: $A : V \\to V$ and $A^* : V \\to V$ that fulfill the criteria of (i) either $A$ is diagonal and irreducible tridiagonal in some basis of $V$ or the matrix corresponding to $A^*$ is diagonal and (ii) either $A^*$ is diagonal and irreducible tridiagonal in some basis of $V$ or the matrix corresponding to $A$ is diagonal. We demonstrate that with 24 general bases, it is possible to capture the characteristics of each one with respect to each pair of linear transformations. The paper then explores the transition map - the unique linear transformation from $V$ to $V$ from one of the special bases to another - explicitly as polynomials in terms of $A,A^*$."}
{"text":"\nThis article examines the spectral shifts due to a departure from chemical equilibrium in the atmospheres of L and T dwarfs, and even cooler temperatures. A grid of non-equilibrium models was created for effective temperatures ranging from 200 K to 1800 K, with three different surface gravities, four values of the coefficient of eddy diffusion, and three prescriptions for the CO\/CH$_4$ chemical reaction. We discovered that the overabundance of CO results in a 40% reduction of flux in the M ($\\sim4-$5 $\\mu$m) band between effective temperatures of 600 and 1800 K, with the most significant effect at $T_{\\rm eff} \\approx 1100$ K. When looking at the underabundance of ammonia, this yields a maximum of 20% increase in flux across the range of 300 to 1800 K, with the greatest effects at the lowest values of $T_{\\rm eff}$. The magnitude of departure from chemical equilibrium increases in relation to decreased gravity, increased eddy diffusion coefficient, and slower speed of the CO\/CH$_4$ reaction. Though small, these effects create better fitted spectra to T dwarf measurements. Additionally, it was determined that the suppression in the M band resulting from non-equilibrium CO enhancements vanishes below 500 K and is only partial above 500 K, keeping the M band valuable for discovering brown dwarfs cooler than T dwarfs."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate the decoherence caused by the coupling of charge qubits made up of multiple quantum dots to vibrational bulk modes using the spin-boson model and the Born-Markov approximation. Two different configurations of quantum dot qubits are studied: a ring with three dots containing one excess electron and an arrangement of dots forming multipole charge patterns. We observe that tuning gate voltages can enable single and two-qubit operations with the three-dot qubit, presenting less overhead on such operations than the linear three-dot spin qubit previously proposed. Additionally, using this system with small interdot tunnel amplitudes leads to high $Q$ factors superior to traditional double-dot qubits. The high multipole dot configurations greatly reduce decoherence at low operational frequencies compared to double dot qubits."}
{"text":"\nThis paper discusses the class of generalized CRF-structures, which are complex, isotropic subbundles of the bundle $T_cM\\oplus T^*_cM$, that are closed under the Courant bracket. We demonstrate the equivalence of a generalized F-structure to a skew-symmetric endomorphism $\\Phi$ of $TM\\oplus T^*M$, as well as how these structures can be constructed in various ways. The existence of generalized, Riemannian metrics leads to the definition of generalized CRFK-structures, which extend ongoing research of generalized K\u00e4hler structures, and are related to quadruples of classical, metric CRF-structures. Lastly, we discuss generalized Sasakian structures and their attributes."}
{"text":"In this article, we investigate the role of quark-scalar loop interactions in the electric dipole moments (EDMs) of the neutron, deuteron, and mercury arising from supersymmetric models without R parity conservation. We provide analytical formulae to display the resulting EDMs, which are dependent on the top Yukawa coupling and top mass, as well as the R-parity violating parameters in the mass-squared matrix. Proving particularly strong, our bounds on the $B_i \\lambda^{\\prime}_{ij1}$ combinations are more powerful than for the mercury EDM. These constraints will apply even if the phases of the R-parity violating couplings vanish and the CKM phase is non-zero, extending to cases of heavy slepton masses and $\\tan \\beta$. Should the Los Alamos EDM or deuteron EDM experiments produce no new data, the residual RPV parameter space could be significantly reduced."}
{"text":"\nWe present near-infrared observatory results of the UY Aur binary system taken with the Coronagraphic Imager with Adaptive Optics on the Subaru Telescope. Utilizing adaptive optics, we achieved a remarkably high spatial resolution of 0.1\" in the full width at half maximum of the point spread function. Our current analysis suggests an orbital period of ~1640 years and a total mass of ~1.73 solar mass. The H-band magnitude of the secondary was observed to change by as much as 1.3 magnitudes within a span of a decade, suggesting photospheric variability caused by a varying accretion rate, or the rotation of the secondary. Additionally, a half-ring shaped circumbinary disk with an inclination of 42\u00b0 and an inner radius of approximately 520 AU was detected. The northeast portion was considerably weaker in brightness than the southwest side, with a ratio of ~57. Remarkably, the detected disk was observed to have a clumpy structure, circumstellar material in the inner cavity, and an extended armlike structure. We believe that this latter structure is likely to be a result of material accreting from the outer regions of the disk, or encounters with other stellar systems."}
{"text":"\nThis article examines the potential of hadron colliders, such as the Fermilab Tevatron and the CERN LHC, to detect new spin-1 chiral bosons which are hinted at by recent precise low-energy experiments. Specifically, these experiments indicate a 4.5 sigma discrepancy between the measured and predicted two pion branching ratio of the tau decay and a 3.3 sigma review of the muon (g-2) theoretical prediction from the experimental value. Evaluations of the associated cross-sections are carried out using the CalcHEP package and initial results from the Tevatron suggest that the lightest charged chiral boson could have a mass of about 500 GeV. New data from the Tevatron and the LHC may confirm or disprove these findings, with the potential to discover charged and neutral chiral bosons up to a mass of 1 TeV."}
{"text":"\nWe have studied the peculiar motion of clusters of galaxies within the Ursa Major supercluster and its surrounding area through an analysis of Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data. A sample of early-type galaxies was compiled and their fundamental plane was used to assess cluster distances and peculiar velocities. The results for the 12 UMa clusters in three distinct subsystems of the supercluster as well as nine clusters from nearby regions were similar. The density of these systems (3 for galaxies and 15 for clusters) indicates that the whole construction is gravitationally bound. Peculiar velocities did not exceed the measurement errors by more than a 2-fold amount. Furthermore, the average random peculiar velocities of the clusters and their congruence with the general Hubble expansion were compatible with the findings of theoretical models. In order to verify the potential convergence of the three UMa subsystems, the precision of the analysis should be improved by a factor 2-3."}
{"text":"\nThe goal of this study is to create an economically viable Polymer Optical Fiber (POF) Demultiplexer for Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) systems to fulfil the increasing bandwidth demands of the automotive and home entertainment sectors. The concept relies on separating chromatic light into its monochromatic components with the help of a prism with low reciprocal dispersion power. To make the Demultiplexer cost-effective, components such as the prism and others necessary for path adjustment must be produced using injection molding. This technique offers an efficient and economical approach for producing POF Demultiplexers in large numbers."}
{"text":"\nIn this article, we explore the effect of foreground emission from interplanetary and Galactic dust on the measurement of the far infrared cosmic background (CIB) using COBE\/DIRBE data and the Wisconsin H-alpha Mapper (WHAM) Northern Sky Survey as a tracer of the ionized medium. After analyzing the DIRBE data for five high Galactic latitude regions and decomposing it into H I and H-alpha correlated components, we found that the H-alpha correlated component was close to zero. Our investigation suggests that the addition of an H-alpha correlated component to the modeling of the foreground emission has minimal impact on the determination of the CIB. We obtained CIB detections and 2 sigma upper limits in the 60, 100, 140 and 240 micron bands, which showed similarity to those derived in previous studies. We determined upper limits on the 100 micron emissivity of the ionized medium that were roughly 40% of what was found for the neutral Atomic medium, which could partly be attributed to a lower dust-to-gas mass ratio in the ionized medium."}
{"text":"We report a significant flare in an ultraluminous X-ray source located inside NGC 1365, a galaxy in the Fornax cluster. Utilizing 12 Chandra and XMM-Newton observations taken from 2002 - 2006, we found that the source brightness peaked at ~3 x 10^40 erg\/s and then quickly declined on an e-folding timescale of approximately 3 days. X-ray spectroscopy revealed a dominant broad power-law-like component as well as an additional soft thermal component when the luminosity was at or near ~10^40 erg\/s. This thermal component is theorized to be emitted from the accretion disk. Ionized absorption was also observed at the beginning of the decline in brightness. These results, combined with a photon index of Gamma ~1.7 and lack of thermal emission when luminosity is above 3 X 10^40 erg\/s suggest that this source is in a \u2018high\/hard\u2019 state. Our analysis of the data implies the accreting black hole has a mass of 50 - 150 Msun, even without considering beaming effects."}
{"text":"\nThis article investigates how Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT) via conjugation impacts the mutation-selection equilibrium of a prokaryotic, unicellular organism population in a static environment containing certain levels of antibiotic. Calculations and simulations were undertaken to inspect effects of differing HGT rates and antibiotic first-order death rates. It's found that, generally, a low HGT rate offers optimum mean fitness, and mean fitness drops slightly when the HGT rate increases and crosses a certain threshold before increasing again to an asymptotic but lesser limiting value. Despite this, the effect is negligible for most reasonable parameters and disappears with weaker antibiotic. Ultimately, the paper suggests a small but potentially advantageous selective benefit of HGT that manifests when experiencing environmental pressures. This is reflected in known observations of the promotion of HGT under stressful conditions."}
{"text":"In this paper, we compare star formation on large scales by looking at the Bolocam 1.1 millimeter dust continuum surveys of the three nearby star forming clouds, including 7.5 sq. deg of Perseus, 10.8 sq. deg of Ophiuchus, and 1.5 sq. deg of Serpens. We detect 122, 44, and 35 cores in each cloud respectively and analyze the angular core size, as well as the effects of distance on the resolution. The mass distribution of cores in Perseus and Ophiuchus are comparable to that of the stellar IMF, while that of Serpens is flatter. Our findings also suggest the three clouds have low star-formation efficiencies, as dense cores only make up less than 10% of the total cloud mass. Furthermore, the bulk of 1.1 millimeter cores are associated with high column densities."}
{"text":"\nIn order to make progress toward understanding the complex network of complex interactions between proteins in cells, we present an approach known as augmented sparse reconstruction to reconstruct and identify connections in cellular protein signaling and biochemical networks. By utilizing the well-studied epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling cascade as a test case, we demonstrate the development of a system of representation through the use of integrals of trajectories with different starting conditions and the softening of specific terms of the representation. We then use random vectors to augment the system in order to achieve parsimonious representations of the each node's dynamic connections. This approach is able to accurately detect just a few relevant connections between nodes, even when incorporating noise into the measured trajectories. After examining the performance of augmented sparse reconstruction on a model of the EGFR protein network, we explore the potential for therapeutic applications of this method in the future."}
{"text":"In this article, a novel scheme of decoding Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) using convex optimization instead of Maximum Likelihood Decoding (MLD), referred to as Interior Point Decoding (IPD), is proposed. It is designed for linear vector channels, such as Inter Symbol Interference (ISI) and Partial Response (PR) channels. MLD for linear vector channels is converted into a convex, optimisation problem referred to as Relaxed MLD. This problem is solved with an Interior Point Method Barrier Function and its approximate variations, the Gradient Descent and Newton Method. IPD search for points in a fundamental polytope determined by the low-density parity-check matrix. It has shown that IPD exhibits a better Bit Error Rate (BER) performance with lesser complexities when compared to the Joint Message Passing Decoder, in the case of Partial Response channels."}
{"text":"\nThis article examines the geometrical features of Borromean nuclei, which consist of a core plus two weakly bound particles. By analyzing the $B(E1)$ value emerging from electromagnetic dissociation and investigating two-particle correlations through HBT-type analysis, an estimate of the total geometry is generated. The calculated opening angles between the two neutrons in $^{6}$He and $^{11}$Li ended up being ${83^{\\circ}}^{+20}_{-10}$ and ${66^{\\circ}}^{+22}_{-18}$ respectively. After utilizing the laser spectroscopy values for the root means square charge radii to obtain the root means square distance between the cores and the center of mass of the neutrons, a reduction of about 12% for the opening angles was seen. Further, a comparison to a related report by Nakamura \\cite{Nak06} reveals that the opening angle for $^{11}$Li is over 20% larger. The article then turns to $^{14}$Be and the two proton Borromean nucleus $^{17}$Ne, where not all data is currently available.  However, based on the existing experimental and theoretical information, an estimated opening angle of ${64^{0}}^{+9}_{-10}$ and $110^{0}$ respectively were obtained."}
{"text":"\nThis article presents a combined measurement of essential parameters to accurately determine the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix element |V_{cb}|, as well as the form factors for the B0 -> D*- l+ nu_l decay in terms of heavy-quark effective theory. Using a sample of around 52,800 B0 -> D*- l+ nu_l decays recorded by the BaBar detector, our results for the form factors are rho2=1.157+-0.094+-0.027, R_1(1)=1.327+-0.131+-0.043, R_2(1)=0.859+-0.077+-0.021, and F(1)|V_cb|=(34.7+-0.4+-1.0)x10^-3 after combining previous BaBar measurements. After accounting for lattice calculations of the axial form factor $\\mathcal{F}(1)$, it is possible to extract |V_cb| = (37.4+-0.3+-1.2+1.2-1.4)x10^-3 with an exclusive branching fraction of B = (4.69+-0.04+-0.34)%."}
{"text":"\nThis paper investigates the X-ray spectral features of the low-mass X-ray binary Cir X-1 during periods of immersion known as 'dips'. For each dip, multiple segments were analysed with a 3-component blackbody model - two of which are partially blocked by matter- with a Gaussian emission line included to represent the Fe Ka line of 6.4 keV. Results showed the steep temperature separation of 2 and 1 KeV between the two blocked components and the 0.5-0.6 KeV of the uncovered component. In addition, the fluxes of the two hotter components displayed linear correlation in dips, but no variation for the third component. Variation in the Fe Ka line flux was only present during long dips, having a positive relation with the hot fluxes. This suggests decreasing temperatures with radius; a close proximity of the Fe Ka line to the hot continuum; and a larger Fe Ka line than those of obscuring material causing the short dips, but smaller than the size of obscuring material responsible for long dips."}
{"text":"\nWe evaluate the emission of quantum radiation from black holes which are asymptotically close to an Einstein-de Sitter universe. We compare two different scenarios: no accretion, and significant accretion. The radiation power is highly dependent on the asymptotic condition and this mass accretion status. In the no accretion case, we analyze the Einstein-Straus solution where the black hole has a fixed mass within a Friedmann universe of dust. A cosmological correction shows that at present, it's a tiny amount ($10^{-5} (M\/10^{6}M_{\\odot})^{1\/3} (t\/14 {Gyr})^{-1\/3}$) but could have been influential when the primordial black holes formed. This implies that the black hole has not reached equilibrium yet, and this effect may be linked to radiation released from a flat spacetime by a moving mirror. For significant accretion, we look at the Sultana-Dyer solution, which states that the black hole grows in size in proportion to the cosmological scale factor. We find that the radiation power is comparable to Hawking radiation from a Schwarzschild black hole of the same, growing mass. This means that the energy loss due to evaporation is minuscule when compared to the mass accumulated by the black hole. As a result this research suggests a new definition of the quasi-equilibrium temperature of general conformal stationary black holes."}
{"text":"\nBased on the application of two distinct multi-clustering techniques to the BATSE Gamma-ray burst (GRB) catalogue, evidence for three classes of GRBs has been found. This classification splits the long bursts into two categories based on their total fluence and duration, referred to here as low and high fluence GRBs. Statistical analysis of GRBs with known redshifts and spectral parameters indicates that low fluence GRBs have an approximately constant energy output of 10^{52} ergs, with the energy output of the high fluence GRBs varying from 10^{52} to 10^{54} ergs. It is assumed that this three-fold division of GRBs reflects different origination events, such as the merger of neutron star systems, a merger between a white dwarf and a neutron star and the collapse of massive stars."}
{"text":"\nWe present a (0,2) gauged linear sigma model on a supermanifold derived using both Abelian and non-Abelian gauge groups. To ensure that the resulting Action satisfies supersymmetry invariance, we require that certain consistency conditions be satisfied. For the Abelian gauge group, these conditions are formulated so as to agree with the (0,2) chirality conditions of the (0,2) chiral superfields. In the non-Abelian gauge group, we introduce the $\\hat{U}$ operator, as well as an enlarged operator $\\hat{U}^{a}$. The supermanifold \\mathcal{M}^{m|n} is demonstrated as an example of a Calabi-Yau supermanifold by mapping onto the super weighted complex projective space WCP^{m-1|n} in the U(1) case."}
{"text":"\nWe study the decays $B\\to a_1(1260) \\pi$ and $a_1(1260) K$ by applying QCD factorization. G-parity manifests due to the light-cone two-parton distribution amplitudes' antisymmetry under quark and anti-quark momentum fraction exchange in the SU(2) limit. Interference effects of tree and penguin diagrams impact the branching ratios of  $a_1 \\pi$ modes, which is in concordance with current data. However, for the CP asymmetries in the $B^0\\to a_1^\\pm \\pi^\\mp$ decays a larger $\\gamma \\gtrsim 80^\\circ$ needs to be considered. Moreover, large annihilation contributions are present in $a_1 K$ modes, which are partially controlled by the Gegenbauer moment of the tensor light-cone distribution amplitude.

{"text":"\nUsing HST\/NICMOS and NTT\/SOFI infrared photometry, we have determined accurate distances for four globular clusters in the Galactic bulge; Terzan 5, Liller 1, UKS 1 and Terzan 4. We studied the distance to the metal-rich clusters using the Horizontal Branch relative to the reddening line of NGC 6528. Transformations to J and H magnitudes with different assumptions were also used. Liller 1 and Terzan 4 were discovered to be the same distance as NGC 6528, while UKS 1 was farther and Terzan 5 was found to be 5.5 $\\pm$ 0.9 kpc from the sun. The close proximity of Terzan 5 to the solar system creates an environment in which the high cluster density can be ideal for the formation of millisecond pulsars."}
{"text":"\nWe show through HI observations that the edge-on galaxy NGC 891 contains a vast gaseous halo, much larger than ever seen before. Around 30% of the HI gas lies in the halo. This gas demonstrates structures on disparate scales, including a filament extending up to 22 kpc above the galactic plane, and small (~10^6 Msol) clouds with irregular velocities. Furthermore, the kinematics of the halo gas includes a lagging differential rotation in relation to the disk, more prominent near the nucleus and elevated with respect to the plane. Furthermore, a combination of the galactic fountain effect, alongside the addition of intergalactic material can likely attribute to the mass and movement of the halo. This is supported by the HI filament and counter-rotating clouds."}
{"text":"\nAnalysis of water masers in NGC 4258 (M 106) has indicated the presence of a warped Keplerian accretion disc. This study explores the potential of a relativistic Bardeen-Petterson effect, driven by a Kerr black hole, to be the physical cause of such warping. Maximum spin parameter values permitted by observational data were used to model the disc. Numerical simulations show that a warped transition zone, exhibiting a gradient in tilt and twist angles, is produced -- echoing the structure seen in NGC 4258. This provides evidence that the Bardeen-Petterson effect is the responsible physical mechanism. Furthermore, the time like necessary for this alignment was found and evidenced to only be a few billion years, even with the high spin parameter of NGC 4258. A connection with precession of the radio jet\/counterjet was also explored with positive indications that the Bardeen-Petterson effect can be the cause for the precession period in this case."}
{"text":"\nThis paper presents the first results of a comprehensive spectroscopic study of globular clusters in the outervsion of the closeby M31 galaxy. The observed candidates were selected from the XSC of 2MASS and were classified according to their radial velocity and by verifying their source nature on optical images. Out of the 48 cluster candidates, five genuine remote globular clusters were identified. including one that was independently found by Mackey et al. (2007). These newly discovered clusters range from 40-100 kpc away from M31's center and have absolute integrated magnitudes of -9.5 to -7.5. All of the observed globular clusters have measured strengths of the Lick indices and their metallicities have been estimated. Mackey-GC1, Martin-GC1, B517 and B518 have spectrums that correspond to old and metal poor clusters (-1.3 or smaller) and B519 is old but relatively metal-rich at -0.5. B516 has very substantial Balmer absorption which implies it has a young age (<2 Gyr). This data nearly doubles the number of known M31 glubular clusters in its outskirts and, in comparision to the Milky Way, M31 has a significantly higher density of bright globular clusters."}
{"text":"\nThis study investigates the effect of a double optical lattice on a controllable three-dimensional Brownian motor. We systematically control the relative phases between the lattices, imparting drifts in arbitrary directions. We observe the dynamics of the induced drift in the vertical direction and the temperature, while exploring a range of 2pi x 2pi relative phases. Our results indicate that it is possible to achieve a drift which is concurrently adjustable in speed and direction by changing the phases perpendicularly and parallel to the vertical drift. We use numerical simulations to reproduce the same trends in our experiments."}
{"text":"\nThis paper investigates the various formulations of Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) within field theories, in order to assess its successes and failures from both an experimental and a field-theoretical viewpoint. New difficulties with existing models are also discussed and fine-tuning of some models is highlighted. Moreover, a route to constructing models of MOND-like gravity, with simple field equations outside matter, is presented. An analysis of the field equations within matter reveals however that they do not remain hyperbolic. Surprisingly, this theoretical framework also provides a model that reproduces the Pioneer anomaly without compromising any of the precision tests of general relativity. This paper thus concludes that while some frameworks such as the tensor-vector-scalar (TeVeS) of Bekenstein and Sanders appear more promising than others, it currently remains challenging to construct a consistent MOND-like model of gravity that is both experimentally successful and reliable."}
{"text":"\nIn this work, we analyze the phase transition of magnetic thin films through the Ising ferromagnetic model via a Monte Carlo simulation with high resolution. We observe that when the film\u2019s thickness increases slightly, the deviation of the critical exponent $\\beta$, which describes the behavior at critical points of the system, from its two-dimensional (2D) value is larger than that of the exponent $\\nu$. Moreover, when the thickness stays constant and finite-size scaling isn\u2019t employed into the perpendicular direction of the film parallel to the 2D surface, the three-dimensional (3D) values of the critical exponents can\u2019t be achieved even with extensive thicknesses. Our research suggests that the crossover to 3D universality class calls for finite-size scaling in the direction of the film\u2019s thickness. To measure the effective dimension of the system, we use the MC value of the critical exponent $\\alpha$. In conclusion, the critical behavior of thin films reveals an effective dimension between 2D and 3D."}

Through the combined use of lensing and X-ray techniques, we evaluate the dynamical state and estimate the total mass of the cluster, while also identifying four gravitational arc candidates. We find Z3146 to be in a relatively relaxed mosaic, evidenced by the presence of a substantial cooling flow and the regularity of galaxy density, light distributions, and weak lensing mass reconstruction. Our multiple methods of mass content determination provide agreement within 25% at r_{200}=1661 h_{70}^{-1}kpc, with a corresponding velocity dispersion of \\sigma_v=869^{+124}_{-153}km\/s."}
{"text":"\nIn this set of lectures, we investigate how the algebraic characteristics of discrete subgroups of Lie groups affect their possible actions on circles and surfaces. We explore two key properties, namely almost simplicity and the presence of a distortion element, in order to gain insight into the dynamics of non-compact Lie groups on surfaces. Our methods are extensively drawn from low-dimensional dynamics, and we pay particular attention to the influence of features like commutativity and nilpotence. Lastly, our study concentrates mostly on groups of diffeomorphisms that preserve a Borel probability measure."}
{"text":"\nThis paper examines the energetics, skeletal dynamics, and long-term forecasting of the Kolmogorov-Lorenz systems. The paper is divided into two sections which analyze the extremum of state functions, construct Poincar\u00e9 surfaces of the return map, and assess different orbits classified by their maximum energy and Casimir balances. Furthermore, the second section explores a new approach to maximum energy based long-term extrapolations and the characteristics of local predictability. Finally, the paper provides a look into the potential expansion of this type of prediction analysis for related (geo)fluid dynamics."}
{"text":"\nIn this paper, we explore the role of inverse Compton (IC) emission in producing high energy afterglows and flares in Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRB). We investigate the physical parameters driving the production of IC and synchrotron emissions and analyze the behavior of GeV and X-ray intensity associated with various models of a fireball in either a uniform or a wind-like interstellar medium. Our findings show that a substantial GeV emission can be expected from a short or long duration central engine activity and that IC scattering of X-ray flare photons will yield GeV-band flares. We suggest that the GLAST satellite can detect these high energy flares for certain GRBs that show flares in their X-ray light curves, given the burst kinetic energy is sufficient. Further, we postulate that X-ray flares with a peak energy of ~10 eV will produce high energy flares with a peak energy of around 100 MeV-GeV, which if observed, indicate a simultaneity in flares between low and high energy bands."}
{"text":"This article investigates how the stability of proteins affects the complexity and rate of molecular evolution. Specifically, it looks at the effect of popoulation dynamics, physical properties of proteins, and their thermodynamic responses to point mutations. It posits that the distribution of protein stabilities is universal and provides a relationship between mutation rate, maximal genome size, and protein thermodynamic responses. Additionally, it suggests that without error correction, modern RNA viruses and primordial genomes must be limited in size. This article seeks to pinpoint a natural speed limit on the rate of molecular evolution and discusses how this limit applies to various organisms, including RNA viruses and bacteria."}
{"text":"This research paper aims to investigate the potential sending of a charged dust ball through a Reissner--Nordstr\\\"{o}m wormhole. The article outlines a set of criteria to prevent Big Bang\/Big Crunch, shell crossing and permanent central singularities, as well as examining the energy density of the dust ball, which reveals surprising features that were previously unknown. Additionally, it demonstrates how a pulsating configuration, with a permanent central singularity and a period of pulsation independent of mass, is feasible."}
{"text":"This paper considers the issue of whether convex, compact sets with non-empty interiors $S =\\{x\\in \\re^n: g_1(x)\\geq 0, ..., g_m(x)\\geq 0\\}$, which are defined by multivariate polynomials $g_i(x)$, can be represented as the projection of some LMI (Linear Matrix Inequality) representable set; such $S$ is known as semidefinite representable or SDP representable. If the polynomials $g_i(x)$ are all concave on $S$ and the Positive Definite Lagrange Hessian (PDLH) condition holds, then $S$ is shown to be SDP representable. Similarly, if each $g_i(x)$ is either an SOS-concave or strictly quasiconcave on $S$, then the set is also SDP representable. Finally, if each set $S_i$ is either SOS-convex or poscurv-convex (having a boundary with positive curvature and being non-singular), then $S$ is also shown to be SDP representable. The complexity of Schm\\\"{u}dgen and Putinar's matrix Positivstellensatz, which are\nessential to the proofs of the results, is also given."}
{"text":"\nExploring the potential of the SNO+ experiment, we investigate the time variability of the solar neutrino flux at lower and intermediate energies. We study the capacity of SNO+ to discriminate between the two classesified solar models - SSM I and SSM II - which have high and low heavy element abundances, respectively. Additionally, we evaluate the rate of events predicted by the SSM I and SSM II in the cases of Standard LMA and LMA+Spin Flavour Precession scenarios. It is predicted that after gathering three years of SFNO+ data, the pep flux can distinguish between the LMA and LMA+SFP scenarios regardless of the solar model. In the event the LMA rate is measured, SFP could be dismissed at more than 4$\\sigma$. A low rate would evidence new physics, with all the 90% accepted range of the standard LMA being dismissed at 3$\\sigma$. The most obvious variance between SSM I and SSM II is seen in the CNO fluxes, hence their detection at SNO+ will be essential to decide which is the correct model. With confirmation of either LMA or SFP by means of the pep rate, a CNO measurement in conjunction with the Chlorine experiment will indicate either a LMA+SFP scenario, or the preference of SSM II over SSM I."}
{"text":"\nThis paper outlines an experiment involving the interaction of two isotropic, time-decaying turbulent fields with different kinetic energies. An analysis is conducted of the resulting anisotropy, intermittency, and velocity and velocity derivative statistics, particularly in the limit of $E_1\/E_2 \\to \\infty$. This outcome corresponds to the maximum difference in turbulent energy between two fields which can be observed, one being nearly still. The experiment reveals that the presence of a gradient of turbulent energy is sufficient for the onset of intermittency and that pressure transport plays an important role in the mixing. These findings point to the conclusion that a difference in turbulent energy is the basis for any Gaussian departure in turbulence."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate the potential of quantum particles arranged in a line to perform universal adiabatic quantum computing. With nine states per particle, we prove this to be possible. This finding has possible applications for those looking to build adiabatic quantum computers. By adding some more technical effort and increasing the number of states to twelve, we demonstrate that state energy approximation becomes QMA-complete. This is in stark comparison to the analogous classical problem, which is contained in P. To prove this, the usual methods are not sufficient and so we had to find an additional way - ruling out all illegal configurations by accounting for how they will evolve in the future. Our results show that, if the quantum Church-Turing thesis is accepted and quantum computers cannot efficiently solve QMA-complete problems, one-dimensional systems that take exponential time to reach their ground state may appear as one-dimensional spin glasses."}
{"text":"\nWe explore the relationship between Euclidean algorithms, music, and distance geometry. Specifically, we show how Euclidean algorithms can be used to create a family of rhythmic timelines, called Euclidean rhythms, that have the mathematical property of evenly distributed beat onsets. Evenness is defined as maximizing the sum of Euclidean distances between all pairs of onsets, treating onsets as points on a circle. In addition, Euclidean rhythms are shown to be deep - each distinct distance between onsets occurs with a unique multiplicity. We also characterize all deep rhythms, proving that they form a subclass of generated rhythms and demonstrating a useful property called shelling. Furthermore, many of the problems we explore are interesting from a distance geometry point of view, having been previously investigated by Erd\\H{o}s. These results can be applied to musical scales as well as rhythms."}
{"text":"\nWe present the analysis of the Type Ib supernova 1999dn in five epochs through non-LTE stellar atmosphere spectra based on PHOENIX. The objective of this study is threefold: to compute the ejecta physical parameters such as temperature, density, and velocity; to reproduce the He I absorption lines by non-thermal excitation; and to explore the possible presence of hydrogen, primarily through a feature around 6200 Angstrom that has been attributed to high velocity H$_\\alpha$. All models have a uniform composition with no hydrogen. The results show our models fit the observations, accurately reproducing most of the features including He I absorptions. We consider the combination of Fe II and Si II lines as a stronger substitute for H$_\\alpha$ as a source for the 6200 Angstrom feature, which we can achieve by increasing the metallicity viewpoint. High metallicity models match early epochs, though not as optimal than solar metallicity models after the maximum brightness is attained. In addition, a further investigation of hydrogen as a potential source of the 6200 Angstrom feature will be addressed in our second paper with models involving a thin shell of hydrogen surrounding the main composition."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate spin-flips of paramagnetic dangling-bonds at the\namorphous-semiconductor\/oxide interface as a potential source of magnetic noise in different systems. With the aid of a single-phonon cross-relaxation mechanism, we study spin-flip times over a wide range of temperatures and frequencies which are affected by three important scales: spin Zeeman energy delta, minimum (E_min) and maximum (E_max) values for the energy splittings of tunneling two-level systems. We compare with an experiment and deduce a dangling-bond area density for a real device structure and calculate resulting qubit coherence times. In addition, we also propose magnetic flux noise from a Si\/SiO_2 substrate in SQUIDs and consider how to mitigate this noise with hydrogen passivation and residual nuclear-spin noise. Our calculations of flux noise have a spectral density of 10^{-12}Phi_{0}^{2} {Hz}^{-1} at 1Hz which could explain the flux noise seen in some devices."}
{"text":"\nThis paper considers the problem of distilling local pure states from mixed ones, which can be represented in an information theoretic paradigm. We analyze the optimal rate of production of local purity distilled from bipartite quantum systems by Alice and Bob, when many copies of the quantum state are shared between them yet the use of the dephasing channel is bounded.  We present an expression for the local purity that can be efficiently computed, as well as examples of tradeoff curves arising from it. This extends the results of Phys. Rev. A 71, 062303 (2005), which studied the case of an unbounded usage of the dephasing channel."}
{"text":"\nThis research seeks to create models which can be used to assess the formation and interactions of planets with protoplanetary disks, in internally turbulent accretion disks. We further aim to test the suitability of Cartesian codes in describing the Magnetohydrodynamics of this system, and our 3D MHD simulations do demonstrate the ability of such codes to sustain the MHD turbulence. Examining the influence of disk scale height on the magnetorotational instability, we find agreement with shearing box calculations. The turbulent stresses increase with thermal pressure in compliance with a power law of 0.24 +- 0.03. Additionally, we discover that the ratio of stresses decreases with an increase in temperature. We also study the dynamics of boulders in this hydromagnetic turbulence, and find that the vertical turbulent diffusion of the embedded boulders is similar to the turbulent viscosity of the flow. This pattern of boulder concentrations in high pressure regions leads to significant density increases."}
{"text":"\nIn this study, we developed a method for identifying young early-type galaxies in the GOODS\/CDF-S region, which utilizes photometric redshifts, spectral-type classification and optical\/near-infrared colors. We obtained a complete and homogenized data set of early-type field galaxy candidates and their structural parameters support that they have early morphological types. An examination of the luminosity and color evolution of these galaxies versus redshift and mass suggests that massive field galaxies have starbursts at higher redshifts than lower mass galaxies. Moreover, we observe a higher proportion of young ellipticals in sub-L* early-type galaxies compared to brighter galaxies, and this proportion rises with redshift. Our findings are compatible with the notion that stars in substantial early-type field galaxies were formed earlier than their low-mass counterparts."}
{"text":"\nWe conducted observations at radio, millimeter, and infrared wavelengths of the 5.54-second anomalous X-ray pulsar, XTE J1810-197. At the IRAM 30m telescope, the pulsar was detected at 88 and 144GHz, the highest frequency detections to date of an individual pulsar. We observed numerous individual pulses, each 2ms wide and a peak flux density as high as 45Jy. Contemporaneous observations with the Parkes, Nancay, and Green Bank telescopes identified its spectral index as -0.5<alpha<0 over the range 1.4-144GHz. Varying observations with the Very Large Array and Australia Telescope Compact Array indicated a similar spectral index and the linearly polarized signals perceived by IRAM reinforced these observations. Further, this study suggested the transition frequency at the interstellar medium may be ~50GHz. Through Very Large Telescope observations of 2.2um, we detected the pulsar at a previously unseen faintness level of K_s=21.89+-0.15. However, analysis of four archival observations spanning three years showed fluctuations in the IR flux that were independent of the X-ray flux, thus no correlation between the two fluxes has yet been established."}
{"text":"Through analysis of Chandra X-ray and VLA radio data, we explore the inner jet of NGC 315, a nearby radio galaxy. Evidence of X-ray synchrotron radiation is found along the jet out to 30 arcsec from the nucleus, indicating particle acceleration in both regions of fast bulk flow and deceleration. X-ray and radio emission show similar transverse extents, which may necessitate distributed particle acceleration. In addition, a remarkable filament, comprising roughly 10 per cent of the diffuse emission in both wavelengths, displays an oscillatory shape and roughly aligned magnetic field. This, combined with particle acceleration requirements, suggest the filament is located within a shear layer between fast, inner flow and slower, outer flow."}
{"text":"\nObserving the evolution of the Mbh-sigma and Mbh-L relations requires careful consideration of selection bias, as AGN luminosity is known to be linked to black-hole mass. This bias comes from cosmic scatter in the mentioned relations, meaning the mean luminosity or stellar velocity dispersions for galaxies of a given Mbh may be different from those given by inverting said relations. The bias is particularly pronounced for high Mbh, where luminosity and dispersion functions for galaxies drop off rapidly. This can lead to Mbh being perceived as larger in distant samples for certain luminosities or dispersions. To properly measure evolution, selection must be accurately replicated across all redshifts."}
{"text":"In this article, we take an in-depth look into the Newton's law in 5-D supersymmetric braneworld models. We focus on the particular setup of having two 4-D branes with a cylindrical spacetime in-between that possesses a scalar field $\\phi$ that is related to the volume of extra dimensions in string theory. After examining the bulk spectrum of gravitons and stabilizing the moduli with supersymmetry, we consider the gravitational interaction between massive bodies in the positive tension brane which is mediated by the gravitons. We find that the Newton's law takes into account a non-trivial contribution at short distances based on the shape of the superpotential $W(\\phi)$. We draw calculations for the dilatonic braneworld and explore the implications for 5-D Heterotic M-theory, suggesting that a specific footprint ought to be observed within micron scales in the near future."}
{"text":"\nWe present a method of constructing dynamical models with an arbitrary density and anisotropy profile in order to reproduce observed radial anisotropy in galaxies and dark matter haloes. A parameterized anisotropy profile is proposed, which generalizes the Osipkov-Merritt profile and can represent any smooth monotonic anisotropy profile. Using the proposed model, a seven-parameter set of dynamical components can be constructed and dynamical properties can be calculated analytically. Through the study of simple one-component dynamical models, we construct families of Plummer and Hernquist models which include flexible anisotropy profiles of small and large radii as potntial parameters. In addition, a three-parameter family generalizes these models, generating Veltmann potential-density pairs self-consistently."}
{"text":"\nBy using various tools to analyze the dynamics of scrip systems, this paper contributes insights regarding the optimization of such systems. We show that increasing the money supply until it causes a monetary crash yields the highest possible social welfare. We also investigate the effects of altruism and hoarding on the effectiveness of the system, and reveal that too much altruism can lead to a crash, but that hoarders surprisingly stabilise the system and help avoid one. Furthermore, we describe how strategic complementarities in the system can be used to efficiently compute equilibria which would be hard or impossible to compute otherwise."}
{"text":"This article investigates the microscopic factors that lead to non-Gaussian distributions in financial returns. We introduce stochastic volatility models that are based on an analogous process to the Born-Oppenheimer approximation which states that the volatility has already reached an equilibrium state and can be used in the pricing process. Through a study of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, it was concluded that these models could produce Tsallis (t-Student) distribution as the probability density of log-returns. We back up this result by fitting the 30-year log-returns of the Dow Jones with a Tsallis distribution, providing the relevant parameters."}
{"text":"\nThis study outlines and designs a network of quantum repeaters to create long-distance quantum states and support both quantum key distribution and distributed quantum computation. The algorithm presented - Banded Purification - uses quantum teleportations and a specialized form of quantum error correction to boost the fidelity of the quantum states. Detailed simulations were used to calculate the throughput for long lines composed of multiple hops. Results show that the algorithmic improvements can increase throughput by up to fifty times compared to earlier systems, for different physical characteristics."}
{"text":"\nAn analysis of the velocity of our Local Group of galaxies in relation to the Cosmic Microwave Background dipole has revealed three major components influencing our motion. Namely, the evacuation of the Local Void, adjustments in the Virgo Cluster and its surroundings, and the large-scale pull from the Centaurus Cluster. Our Galaxy contributes to the bulk motion of the Local Sheet moving away from the Void, while the Leo Spur is seen to be heading in a direction which will lead to its convergence. Upon further investigation, it is revealed that a distant, yet isolated galaxy is exhibiting a motion of at least 230 km\/s away from the center of the Void, leading to the estimation that the Void is located at least 23 Mpc away. In total, these components result in a residual velocity of 631 km\/s."}
{"text":"The initial conditions for \"bubble universes\" in string cosmology can have a major impact on our universe. To provide answers for pre-existing questions about the cosmological origin, an attempt must be made to prevent initial singularities and define the beginning of Inflation. In our proposal, we suggest spatial sections observed by bubble universes be too large to be arbitrarily small. Casimir energy is a potential candidate for such a limitation, but could create instabilities to string theory. We present a proposed set of initial conditions that promises to be non-perturbatively stable and still allows for the Second Law of thermodynamics to be enforced. The conditions proposed are inherited from the spacetime that originally sheltered the bubble universe."}
{"text":"\nThe Infrared Camera (IRC), located on the AKARI satellite, provides exceptional depth and low-resolution spectroscopy with its three channels operating simultaneously in the near- to mid-infrared (1.8--26.5um) range. The NIR channel (1.8--5.5um) is equipped with a 512 x 412 InSb array, whereas the MIR-S (4.6--13.4um) and MIR-L (12.6--26.5um) channels use 256 x 256 Si:As impurity band conduction arrays, all affording a 10' x 10' field-of-view. The MIR-L observes the sky approximately $25' away from the NIR\/MIR-S field-of-view which is shared due to use of a beam splitter. Through use of IRC, we are provided with new information on the formation and evolution of galaxies, the evolution of planetary disks, the process of star-formation, the properties of interstellar matter under various physical conditions, and the nature and evolution of solar system objects. This paper acquaints us with the design of IRC, its in-flight operation, and its imaging performance which is verified to match well with pre-launch expectations."}
{"text":"For the past century, physics has conjectured that space and time are solely explained by the space-time concept, where space holds no ontological status and is merely an observer dependent perspective. This has all changed with the detection of a dynamical 3-space. In this review, we evaluate the properties of this 3-space, including how it has moved from an emergent concept in Process Physics to a phenomenological description as a velocity field. Moreover, the dynamical 3-space theory is further tested by various experiments and astronomical data, leading to a derivation of gravity as a refraction effect of quantum matter waves. We also analyse how the flat and curved spacetime formalisms can be generated from the new physics, accounting for their seemingly successful results."}
{"text":"\nThis paper investigates the implications of the cosmological QCD phase transition that occurred between 10^(-5) seconds and 10^(-4) seconds, at a temperature of approximately 150 MeV, and led to the confinement of quarks and gluons within hadrons. The authors approximate the true QCD vacuum with degenerate theta-vacua and model its effects with a complex scalar field with spontaneous symmetry breaking. They examine the formation of \u201cpasted\u201d or \u201cpatched\u201d domain walls and the evolution of such walls in the long run. It is suggested that a significant portion of dark matter could be attributed to remnants of the domain walls. Additionally, the paper raises the question of whether false vacua associated with color-singlet objects could alter the evaluation of the \u201cradiation-dominated\u201d epoch or the \u201cmatter-dominated\u201d epoch."}
{"text":"\nThis paper examines the diameters of preferential attachment (PA-) models to gain insight into the concept of small world networks. This type of model assigns edges to existing vertices in a proportional manner relative to their degree plus a constant, known as an affine PA-model. Previous analysis has shown that PA-graphs have a power-law degree distribution with a power-law exponent larger than 2 (\\tau > 2). We develop bounds for the upper and lower diameters of this graph when \\tau > 3 or is between 2 and 3 (2 < \\tau < 3). Our evaluation reveals that when \\tau is greater than 3, the diameter of the network is of order \\log{t}, while when \\tau is between 2 and 3 the diameter is of order \\log\\log{t}. This is consistent with the predictions of physicists that the typical distance of such networks is similar to other scale-free random networks, such as the configuration model and inhomogeneous random graph models, where it has been observed that the typical distance is of order \\log\\log{t} or \\log{t}."}
{"text":"\nWe show that the observed smallness of the light quark masses and T violation in hadronic weak interactions may have a common origin. To this end, we construct 3x3 mass matrices for each of the two quark sectors ('upper' and 'lower'), such that they correspond exactly via the $W^{+\/-}$ weak interactions. We impose a hidden symmetry (invariance under simultaneous translations of the quarks in each sector) which implies a zero mass eigenstate in each. Further, we simultaneously break the symmetry and T invariance by introducing a phase factor e$^{i\\chi}$ in each sector. The Jarlskog invariant J$_{CKM}$ is then evaluated and we find that, for measured input parameters, m$_d$ approaches the accepted value of 3-7MeV. A parallel methodology is proposed for leptons, resulting in a Harrison-Scott form for the neutrino mapping matrix V$_\\nu$ which is in agreement with experiments. We also calculate the Jarlskog invariant {\\cal J}$_\\nu$ associated with the correction due to T-violation."}
{"text":"This paper explores the potential of dark matter to exist as a Bose-Einstein condensate. To explore this concept, the non-relativistic Gross-Pitaevskii equation and the hydrodynamic Euler equations were applied, resulting in the creation of a barotropic equation of state. The model was then fitted to a sample of rotation curves from low surface brightness and dwarf galaxies, yielding an agreement between the curves. Additionally, the photon deflection angle from the Bose-Einstein condensate model was calculated and found to be larger than that of more traditional models. These studies suggest that light deflection and gravitational lensing could be used to distinguish the Bose-Einstein condensate dark matter model from other models."}
{"text":"\nWe study the two dimensional distribution and movement of both stars and gaseous ions within the central kiloparsec of both active (Seyfert) and non-active galaxies, taking data from the SAURON Integral Field Unit on the William Herschel Telescope. The low-excitation areas are associated with star formation in both active and inactive galaxies and the high-excitation locations match up to AGN photo-ionisation in the active galaxies. The star movement patterns in each galaxy are typical for disc-type systems, with the kinematic axes matching up to outer-photometry and providing a reliable characterization of the galactic line of nodes. After taking out other elements such as the AGN-driven outflows, the kinematics of both gaseous and stars in each galaxy result in overall consistent alignment. These findings show a similarity between the distribution of light in active and inactive galaxies. In addition, disturbances in the velocity fields of the gaseous component inside of the radius in the Seyfert galaxies appear to increase compared to that of inactive galaxies, which suggests a potential connection between nuclear gas streaming and nuclear activity."}
{"text":"\nAn observation in five radio bands across the spiral galaxy NGC 6946 from 3cm to 21cm has revealed a mild compression and smooth turn in the ordered magnetic field at the inner edge of its gas arm, suggesting a connection to the warm, diffuse gas. Two polarized intensity magnetic arms between the optical arms were identified and displayed a nearly totally aligned field, while Faraday rotations were consistent with two low azimuthal dynamo modes. Three more magnetic arms that appear between HI arms were also observed, along with rings of strongly diminished polarization due to strong Faraday depolarization, suggesting larger-scale helical fields. The total magnetic field in the gas\/optical spiral arms is amplified to around 20\\muG, producing an energy density ten times larger than that of the ionized gas and equal to that of the turbulent gas in the galaxy's inner region. In the outer galaxy, the magnetic energy surpasses that of the turbulent energy."}
{"text":"\nThis study looks into the broadband spectral evolution of Scorpius X-1 by utilizing RXTE archived data from April 1997 to August 2003. We utilize its Color-Color Diagram to make inferences of the mass accretion rate. Through an energy spectra acquired from regions of its Color-Color Diagram, we were able to develop a two-component model made up of a soft thermal component interpreted as thermal emission coming from an accretion disk, and a thermal Comptonization component. Additionally, new evidence suggests the need for an extra third component, which can be shown as a power-law component to represent a second thermal Comptonization from a much hotter plasma, or a hybrid thermal\/non-thermal Comptonization. Our analyses and its implications are discussed, with a critical focus on the hardest X-ray emission and the possible causes for it."}
{"text":"\nThis article examines the dynamics of a random chain whose segments are conjoined and prevented from breaking, which is held at a given temperature in a viscous environment. The collective motion of the chain's constituent particles, the beads, is determined by a brownian motional process in a 2-dimensional space where inter-particle interactions have been eliminated. The constraints on movement of the beads are imposed through the insertion of Dirac delta functions in a path integral approach. The resulting probability distribution of the chain's conformations over time is akin to the partition function of a generalised nonlinear sigma model in two dimensions. The correlation functions of the bead's positions, as well as their probability distribution, have been calculated under a semiclassical approximation for a ring-shaped chain."}
{"text":"This paper provides an overview of lecture notes on the topic of optical quantum computing. It offers insight into the challenges, technologies and possibilities associated with creating a quantum computer using light, which is an ideal, yet difficult, medium for quantum information processing.

{"text":"\nThe Variable Star One-shot Project (VSOP) has been initiated with three main goals: to accurately determine the variability type and spectral type of all unstudied variable stars; to quickly process and make available the associated data; and to discover any serendipitous findings. This article introduces the project in detail, provides an overview of the data collection, dataflow, spectroscopic analysis and its online accessibility of the fully calibrated data. A total of 221 stars that have been observed in the first semester are discussed, wherein high-resolution echelle spectrographs were applied at ESO La Silla Observatory in Chile. Radial velocities were derived by cross-correlating the output with synthetic templates, and spectral types were deduced by a minimum distance matching to synthetic spectra and manually confirmed. Finally, the variability types were identified by analysing the light curves and spectroscopy results. In addition, the future plans of using a new classifier that was developed by VSOP members and that is based on the spectroscopic and photometric classifiers of COROT and Gaia is also discussed. The paper details the confirmation or revision of 221 variable stars from the General Catalogue of Variable Stars, as well as the discovery of 26 multiple systems with several visual binary components. Specific results are presented for stars such as V349 Vel, BC Gru, V4385 Sgr, V1045 Sco and DM Boo, which have been re-classified as a BY Draconis variable."}
{"text":"\nThe debris disk surrounding the main sequence star AU Microscopii (GJ 803) is of great interest when compared to its A5V counterpart, beta Pic, for studying disk evolution for various spectral types. Through the use of Keck II telescope and adaptive optics, the disk from 8-60 AU was revealed in the near-IR JHK' bands with a new data reduction technique for the removal of the stellar point spread function. As a result, a blue color was detected through the near-IR bands and structural features with wavelength-dependent positioning were found in the inner disk. Modeling of dust distribution by a Monte Carlo radiative transfer code confirmed the disk's large-scale architecture. This further revealed a parental belt from 35-40 AU producing dust which is swept outward by radiation and stellar winds. Moreover, findings of very small grains down to 0.05 micron in the outer region were in accordance with stellar mass-loss rates significantly smaller than 10^2 Mdot_sun."}
{"text":"\nThe extended t--J model on a checkerboard lattice at certain densities of electrons can produce unique insulating states of matter. This study looks into the metal-insulator transition in the presence of a repulsive Coulomb force, which is found to be affected by the sign of the hopping. The states resulting from this transition are Mott states, characterized by a breaking of the lattice symmetry, but with a more nuanced form than a simple Charge Density Wave. To analyze this behavior, extended quantum fully-packed loop or dimer models were applied and different diagonal and off-diagonal plaquette correlation functions were evaluated. The resulting low-energy spectra suggest that, analogous to configurations at $n=1\/2$, the system at $n=1\/4$ or $n=3\/4$ display plaquette order in the form of a Resonating-Singlet-Pair Crystal with a four-fold degenerate ground state and a fourfold-enlarged lattice unit cell. Differing from bosonic analogs and highlighting the influential role of spin on the stabilizing of plaquette phases, this work brings insight into the exotic Mott phases originating from repulsion on frustrated lattices."}
{"text":"\nWe analyze the covering properties of a sequence of intervals set by a given sequence of values $\\{r_n\\} \\subset \\R^+$ around a $\\mu$-generic point $x$ in the doubling map $T$ of the circle, and its relationship to the local entropy function of the Gibbs measure $\\mu$ and the hitting times of moving targets. Different to the work of Beresnevich and Velani \\cite{BV}, we establish a mass transference principle for multifractal measures. Using symbolic language, we give a detailed description of the combinatorial structure of a typical, relatively short sequence, including the occurrence of atypical, longer words. These results are further connected to the theoretical field of inhomogeneous diadic diophantine approximation of numbers falling into a certain diophantine class."}
{"text":"\nThe effects of spin-polarized currents on the reorientation of the magnetization of ferromagnets are substantial. To understand and exploit their influence, it is necessary to quantify the spin-transfer-torque vector in magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs). Herein, accurate measurements of both the magnitude and direction of this torque in Co60Fe20B20\/MgO\/Co60Fe20B20 MTJs have been made and compared to predictions for highly-spin-polarized tunneling. The in-plane component d{tau}_{parallel}\/dV remains large, even when the bias voltage is increased; a perpendicular component tau_{perp}(V) with a bias dependence proportional to V^2, which can reach 30 percent of the in-plane torque, has also been measured. These findings present an essential step towards understanding the mechanisms underlying spin-dependent tunneling and exploiting them for the development of future applications such as memory cells and nanoscale microwave oscillators."}

The observation of resonance spectrums and surface polariton modes are detailed, alongside Breit-Wigner-type resonances and Stokes phenomena. Analytic expressions are provided for the dispersion relation, damping and absorption of surface polaritons. Analogies are made to artificial atoms, and implications for the Casimir effect are outlined."}
{"text":"\nThis paper investigates the capability of controlling the heat and wave equations, along with their finite difference approximations, through the alteration of the domain's shape. The goal is to alter the trace of the solution within an open subdomain and at a particular time, given that the right-hand side of the source term is known. The mapping of this trace to the domain's shape is non-linear, and the paper demonstrates the approximate controllability of the linearized parabolic problem, and the exact local controllability of both the linearized and nonlinear hyperbolic equations. In the case of the finite difference spatial semi-discretization located in the parabolic and hyperbolic problems, we show a local controllability for the parabolic equation, and an exact controllability for the hyperbolic problem, which is achieved by applying a local surjectivity theorem in tandem with a unique continuation property of the associated adjoint discrete system."}
{"text":"\nThe aim of this study is to make predictions for the likelihood of triple star systems, with and without a pulsar, in star clusters. To achieve this, numerical simulations of star clusters containing both primordial binaries and triples have been conducted with a range of different parameters, including the total number of stars in the cluster (N_{tot}) and the primordial binary fraction. Results were also cross-referenced with simulations using a mass spectrum representative of the old stellar populations of globular clusters. The simulations reveal that triple star systems are usually two orders of magnitude less abundant than binary systems and the results suggest that the discovery of a triple star system with a pulsar may not require a long wait."}
{"text":"\nWe explore the questions of second-order type isomorphisms by examining their characterization through game semantics. We focus our analysis on the &#955;$\\mu$-calculus, an extension of system F that incorporates classical logic, by developing a categorical framework known as control hyperdoctrines. Our game model of &#955;$\\mu$-calculus, which consists of polymorphic arenas and Hughes' hyperforests, allows us to demonstrate that type isomorphisms are equivalent to the \"equality\" associated with types. From this equality, we deduce the equational characterization of type isomorphisms. We also observe that Roberto Di Cosmo's characterization of type isomorphisms for system F is retrieved from the same model. This methodology allows for a geometrical comprehension of second-order type isomorphism, which may be easily extended to various other polymorphic calculi featuring additional programming characteristics."}
{"text":"\nWe explore the impacts of a magnetic field on the spontaneous breaking of Fermi surface symmetry in an electron with d-wave symmetry \u2013 the so-called d-wave \"Pomeranchuk instability''. Our model utilizes a mean-field of electrons with a pure forward scattering interaction on a square lattice. Magnetic field can be tilted close to the van Hove filling of the majority or minority spin bands, causing the Fermi surface symmetry breakage to surface in both bands but with different magnitudes of the order parameter. Such a transition is usually of second order at high temperature and might turn to one of first order when cooled sufficiently; the end of the second order line will be at a tricritical point. From our assessment, a substantial magnetic field may be able to reduce the transition temperature of a van Hove filling, but it cannot bring up a quantum critical point or a quantum critical endpoint. When taken to the weak coupling limit, the phase diagram may be characterized by a field-free single energy scale and its relative coefficient might vary with the field. In conclusion, a Fermi surface symmetry breakage catalyzed by magnetism is worthwhile to look into when discussing the bilayer ruthenate Sr3Ru2O7 and this article pursues a number of potential issues to substantiate such an idea."}
{"text":"\nThis work examines the stability of viscous shock solutions for isentropic compressible Navier--Stokes equations, or $p$-systems with viscosity. We evaluate the initial work of Matsumura and Nishihara, broadening the set of known parameters for which small-amplitude shocks are stable with an improved version of the argument. Through a specialized spectral energy analysis, we show that no purely real unstable eigenvalues are present for any shock power, and that unstable values are restricted to a bounded region not dependent on the shock strength. An extensive Evans function study confirms that there are no unstable spectra in the entire right-half plane, as far up to Mach number $M \\approx 3000$ for $\\gamma$ spanning 1 to 3. This suggests that shocks are stable for any amplitude, no matter the adiabatic constant $\\gamma$. Lastly, finite-difference simulations of perturbed large-amplitude shocks converge to a version of the original shock wave, as predicted."}
{"text":"\nThis article presents a theoretical study of optical precursors and their relationship to weak-field coherent optical transients. We evaluate an integral of the Fourier type in order to determine the propagated light field for a step-modulated optical field travelling through a dispersive dielectric consisting of a small number of oscillators, each with a narrow-band resonance. An asymptotic method (saddle-point method) is then employed to calculate the precursor fields and their related domains of validity. When the total transient field is computed, combining the asymptotic and exact methods produces excellent agreement in the results. This study reveals that optical precursors can endure for many nanoseconds and the instantaneous frequency chirp can form beats in the transmitted intensity. Our findings suggest that precursors might have already been detected in many preceding experiments."}
{"text":"\n\nThe curvaton scenario has been proposed in order to attain a cosmological\ncurvature perturbation on large scales which acts as an alternative to the standard\nslow-roll scenario of inflation. This is realized by greatly reducing the\ninflation energy scale and thereby suppressing the amplitude of gravitational\nwaves produced during inflation. Through second-order perturbation theory, this\nprocess of the curvaton perturbations could result in generated tensor\nperturbations. Our findings suggest that the outcome of this mechanism can be\ndetected by future gravitational wave detectors, while also being highly\ncorrelated with the amount of non-Gaussianity predicted in the curvaton scenario."}
{"text":"\nThis study examines the connection between a \"striking outwards\" reed and a resonator, which is the most common model of a lip-type valve. Building off of the work done by Wilson and Beavers (1974) and Tarnopolsky (2000), the authors explore the range of playing frequencies in relation to no losses present in the resonator. Analytically, it is proven that when accounted for, the threshold frequency is within the range of a musical sixth and the reed resonance frequency. Also, the smallest blowing pressure is identified as directly correlated to the quality factor of the reed. Finally, numerical results are analyzed and discussed in comparison to past findings from Cullen et al. (2000)."}
{"text":"\nWe examined the stability of isentropic viscous shock profiles at high Mach numbers by combining numerical Evans function calculations and asymptotic ODE estimates. We determined that, in the range $\\gamma \\in [1,2.5]$ and Mach numbers over $2,500$, viscous shock waves are unconditionally stable, independent of shock amplitude, with $\\gamma$-law gas dynamics. The convergence of the Evans function in the high-Mach number limit was established through a boundary-layer analysis, providing an upstream boundary condition for the pressureless (\"infinitely compressible\") gas. In comparison, low-Mach number behavior is known to be incompressible. Our study concluded and reinforced earlier works of Matsumura-Nishihara and Barker-Humpherys-Rudd-Zumbrun, which examined stability at low and intermediate Mach numbers, respectively. Further investigation of other $\\gamma$-values is possible, but hasnot been done yet."}
{"text":"\nThis study examines the usage of a collection of hierarchical descriptors to differentiate between four distinct types of complex networks: Erd\\\"{o}s-R\\'enyi, Barab\\'asi-Albert, Watts-Strogatz and a geographical type of network. The results of the analysis highlighted the relative contribution of each descriptor's feature to the overall discrimination of the models, where the traditional clustering coefficient, hierarchical clustering coefficient and neighborhood clustering coefficient demonstrated most effective. Additionally, the average shortest path length and hierarchical node degrees were revealed to possess minimal influence on the separation of the four network models."}
{"text":"\nThis year marks the 100th anniversary of the exceptional contributions of Albert Einstein to modern physics, specifically statistical mechanics, quantum mechanics, and special relativity. His accomplishments have been rightfully dubbed the 'miraculous year' of Einstein. His influence has extended beyond science, and this work is intended to explore his influence and legacy throughout the last century as well as hint at the future projection of his impact into this new century. Examining a variety of topics such as Einstein and the artistic vanguard movement, his religiosity, his time spent in Argentina, the Nobel Prize, the Einstein-Freud correspondence, his pacifism, nuclear energy, and many of his experimental studies, the differences between genius and crank, Einstein and Borges, philosophy and relativity, Mach\u2019s principle, the relation between science, arts, and humanities, and more, this work illuminates a comprehensive view of the universe of Einstein."}
{"text":"This paper examines the behaviour of two particular classes of dynamical systems which contain holes: expanding interval maps and Collet-Eckmann maps with singularities. We research and demonstrate the existence of a special absolutely continuous conditionally invariant measure $\\mu$ with the specific property that any strictly positive H\\\"{o}lder continuous function converges towards the density of $\\mu$ when it is subject to the system's renormalised dynamics. Additionally, we construct an invariant measure $\\nu$, supported on a Cantor set of points which never escape the system, which displays both ergodicity and exponential decay of correlations with respect to H\\\"{o}lder observables. Our findings also suggest an equilibrium principle where the escape rate formula, often seen in thermodynamic formalism, holds even when the system is not uniformly hyperbolic and lacks a finite Markov partition. Our results are obtained through a general Young towers with holes framework, then later transferred back to the original dynamical system; this strategy may be applicable to other dynamical systems."}
{"text":"\nWe present the results of multiband polarimetric observations of 15 active galactic nuclei with relativistic jets, which were conducted at optical, 1 mm, 3 mm, and 7 mm wavelengths. The degree of linear polarization observed in the sample ranged from less than 1% to over 30%, demonstrating inter-day variability in certain sources. The polarization behavior was classified into three distinct groups, based on the degree of variability in polarization at the 7 mm core: low (LVP), intermediate (IVP), and high (HVP). Results suggest correlations between total flux, fractional polarization, and polarization position angle at different wavelengths. We explain the diverse polarization properties of the sample with models of compression of weak shocks in the jet, and speculate that optical polarized emission likely originates in these shocks located between 3 mm and 7 mm VLBI cores. Our study provides evidence for the idea that the 1 mm core marks the edge of a transition region between an electromagnetically dominated and a turbulent hydrodynamical section of the jet."}
{"text":"This research evaluates the potential threat that Eta Carinae, a massive evolved star in our own galaxy at a distance of 2.3 kpc, may pose as a superluminous supernova. It concludes that Eta Carinae is unlikely to produce any serious harm, either due to the distance it is from our planet, or through any ionization of the atmosphere or cosmic ray effects. There may be some endocrine disruption effects due to light from the peak of the optical spectrum, but due to reddening it is unlikely to be of serious concern."}
{"text":"\nThe CLEO-c detector has been used to analyze a 281 pb^{-1} data sample collected\nat the psi(3770). This allows us to measure, with a statistical significance of\nabout 4.0 standard deviations, an absolute branching fraction of the decay\nD^0 rightarrow K^-pi^+pi^-e^+nu_e. We conclude that 10 candidates are consistent\nwith this decay, with a probability of background fluctuation accounting for\nthis signal being less than 4.1 times 10^{-5}. The resulting branching fraction\nwas found to be {cal B}(D^0 rightarrow K^-pi^+pi^-e^+nu_e)=[2.8 ^{+1.4}_{-1.1}{rm\n(stat)} pm 0.3{rm (syst)}] times 10 ^{-4}.

{"text":"\nIn this paper, we explore two concepts: convolutions on compact groups and Fourier algebras of coset spaces. Specifically, we consider the range of the convolution maps on A(GXG), and the amenability properties of the Fourier algebra of the coset space A(G\/K). Firstly, our work has enabled us to uncover new subalgebras of A(G), present in compact groups without an abelian subgroup of finite index. Our results here provide insight into situations where A(G\/K) lacks basic amenability properties like operator weak amenability. Furthermore, we find that if the connected component of the identity in G is abelian, then A(G\/K) is hyper-Tauberian, while a criterion is proposed to ascertain operator amenability of A(G\/K) for a selection of groups that includes the maximally almost periodic groups."}
{"text":"\nIn this study, we evaluate the ability of current galaxy formation models to predict the rest-frame optical luminosity functions (LFs) of galaxies in the redshift range 2.0 < z < 3.3. We compare the observed LFs with key predictions from semianalytic models (De Lucia & Blaizot and Bower et al.) and hydrodynamic simulations (Dave et al.) and find that they successfully demonstrate some luminosity and redshift ranges, yet fail in others. In particular, all models predict an increase of the rest-frame V-band luminosity density with time, while observations demonstrate a decrease. Additionally, the models do not accurately represent the observed colors of galaxies. In particular, the luminosity density of red galaxies rises sharply between z = 3 and z = 2.2 per models, while the observed data indicates constancy. Similarly, the luminosity density of blue galaxies is roughly constant in the models, while decreasing in the actual data. These distinctions cannot be corrected by simply adjusting the treatment of dust, and suggest that current models do not comprehensively illustrate galaxy formation and evolution since z = 3."}
{"text":"This article examines the possibility that binary stars and extrasolar planets experience shrinking orbits by 1-2 orders of magnitude after formation. It suggests that this could be caused by the combined actions of Kozai cycles and tidal friction. To test this hypothesis, the equations of motion were integrated in order to determine the range of orbital elements. It was found that systems with an initial period of 10 days to 10^5 days could produce binaries with periods of 0.1 to 10 days; the majority of these being 2 days. Additionally, two testable predictions were made: (1) For periods between 3 and 10 days, there should be a peak in the distribution of the mutual inclination of the inner binary and tertiary orbits near 40 and 140 degrees. (2) In cases where the host star has a distant binary companion, the resulting hot Jupiter is likely to have an orbit misaligned with the equator of its host star."}
{"text":"\nThis study examines the challenges of making a ground-based detection of the thermal emission from transiting planet system TrES-1. We collected a series of L grism spectra of the system and a comparison star at similar brightness, offering an opportunity to correct for changes in instrument throughput and atmospheric seeing and absorption. By combining data from two eclipses, we achieved a detection sensitivity near 0.15% relative to the stellar flux. This is approaching the level of sensitivity needed to detect the expected planetary emission, predicted to be between 0.05-0.1% in our 2.9-4.3 micron wavelength band. We discuss techniques that could potentially improve the precision of this technique in the future."}
{"text":"\nThe Gemini Deep Planet Survey (GDPS) has conducted a near-infrared adaptive optics search for giant planets and brown dwarfs orbiting nearby young stars. Through the use of angular differential imaging, the speckle noise of the central star was suppressed, allowing for detection limits to be established for the 85 stars observed. At typical 5-sigma contrast sensitivity, the observations are estimated to be able to detect giant planets with a mass greater than 2 Mjup with a projected separation of 40-200 AU when viewed from a distance of 22 parsecs from the Sun. Using this data, a statistical analysis on the survey results has established upper limits on the fraction of stars with giant planets or low mass brown dwarf companions. This analysis determined that the 95% credible upper limit on the fraction of stars with one or more planets massing 0.5-13 Mjup within a range of 10-25 AU is 0.28 and 0.093 for a range of 50-250 AU. Additionally, the survey found that stars HD 14802, HD 166181, and HD 213845 were each resolved into binaries for the first time."}
{"text":"This paper examines the notion of abstract factorials, with a special focus on their application to the ring of integers. We look at the construction of \"factorial sets\" from subsets of the positive integers, and investigate the equality of consecutive factorials, determining whether the limit superior of the ratios of consecutive factorials converge to a dichotomous value. Numerous examples are provided to demonstrate the applicability of this theorem to prime numbers, Fibonacci numbers, and highly composite numbers. We also prove that, in any given abstract factorial, the series of reciprocals of its factorials will always converge to an irrational number, thereby proving that for any integer k, the series of reciprocals of the cumulative product of divisors from 1 to n raised to the k-th power is irrational."}
{"text":"The infamous truematch algorithm offers two main improvements to traditional cluster matching techniques. First, it maximizes the chi-square transformation of a crosstable rather than solely relying on the trace. This leads to a more comprehensive assessment of the clusters, as it factors in all entries of the crosstable and utilizes the marginal values. Second, it provides a probabilistic solution to breaking ties in the matching process, allowing truly random matchup results when needed. In addition, it is designed to work within the truecluster framework and runs in polynomial time. Initial simulation results show that truematch produces more reliable results. Free R software is available."}
{"text":"\nThe results of analysis of data from the EGRET gamma-ray detector on the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory found an unexpectedly high flux of diffuse galactic gamma rays in the GeV energy range. This anomaly has been attributed to a variety of factors, one of them being the annihilation of supersymmetric dark matter. This paper revisits prior explanations and puts forth a new one: the EGRET detector's sensitivity to gamma rays at energies above ~1 GeV vastly overestimated. Evidence is provided in a new all-sky analysis showing that this explanation is more likely than the dark matter annihilation scenario. Additionally, the findings uphold the original results of the EGRET team on the extragalactic gamma-ray background spectrum. Implications for the upcoming Gamma Ray Large Area Telescope (GLAST) mission are discussed."}
{"text":"\nWe conducted an experiment to measure the fragmentation cross sections created by a 64 MeV\/nucleon primary beam of $^{86}$Kr nuclei, when impacting upon a $^9$Be and $^{181}$Ta target. We collected data on isotopes in the range 25<Z<36, using the RIPS fragment separator at RIKEN. Our results showed a discrepancy between geometrical predictions and the actual cross-section ratios, and were compared with EPAX; an empirical parameterization for fragmentation cross sections. This comparison suggested that present EPAX formulations tend to overestimate cross sections for highly neutron-rich isotopes. Further analysis via an alternative EPAX parameterization proved unsuccessful, suggesting that accurate predictions for these cross sections require data that EPAX does not supply."}
{"text":"\nWe propose to analyse the influence that the gravitational field has on electrodynamics in extreme distances. Our target is to create a heuristic framework of the electromagnetic character of the electron, in an attempt to substitute the traditional misconception of rest. Such a substitution will necessitate the installment of a correlation of a universal speed constraint in the space-time. This speed cannot be accomplished by any particle, instead supporting a background force, or a vacuum energy, making clear the mutability of quantum discrepancies. The space-time will reposition with the assistance of a vacuum energy density, inducing a negative pressure at the cosmological levels, as a counteracting force to the gravitational action, referred to as the cosmological constant. Finally, we expect that the small sum of the vacuum energy density and the yet lower cosmological constant, will align with the actual observational evidence."}
{"text":"\nThe aim of this study is to examine the speed of sound of a Bose-Einstein condensate in an optical lattice in all three dimensions. Our findings indicate that the speed of sound depends substantially on the power of the lattice. As for the one-dimensional case, the sound speed diminishes consistently as the lattice's strength increases. The dependence on the lattice becomes much more intricate in two and three dimensions. In the two-dimensional context, when the interaction is gentle, the sound speed first rises and then drops as the lattice's power intensifies. For the three-dimensional style, the sound speed may even pulsate with the lattice's power. These multifaceted reactions can be traced to the concepts of compressibility and effective mass. Additionally, weak lattice analytical results provide us with an intriguing point of view, showing that the lattice structure perpendicular to the sound's travel increases sound speed while parallel lattice structure reduces sound speed. This diverse behavior of sound speed concerning the lattice power is due to the interaction of these opposite forces."}
{"text":"This article examines how geometric and combinatorial methods can be used to gain greater insight into the structure of phylogenetic mixtures, a model which represents a generalization of the two-state symmetric model. We determine that the set of mixture distributions of this model form a convex polytope and calculate its dimension, offering a simple criterion for determining when a mixture of branch lengths can reproduce the frequency vector of a resolved quartet tree. Using calculations of polytope volumes, we can gain clarity on how common non-identifiable mixtures are under the symmetric model. We present a combinatorial result which extends identifiability results to all pairs of trees of size six or larger, and a positive showing of identifiability for rates across sites models. Lastly, we provide an answer to a previous inquiry into ``mixed-branch repulsion'' on trees larger than quartets under the symmetric model."}
{"text":"\nThis article offers an insight into scale-free avalanches in the multifractal random walk, a model which is often used to explain stock market dynamics.

Additionally, this analysis suggests that cascade models can be used to represent turbulent-like phenomena."}
{"text":"\nIn this article, an alternative to the Euclidian space-time concept is presented to precisely describe the two electrons within a helium atom. The two-dimensional space-time model is based on two orthogonal and complementary units- space and time. It is shown that calculus and complex wave functions have distinctive physical significances under the new atom spacetime. This novel approach is compatible with quantum mechanics and unifies mathematical theories such as complex functions, calculus and trigonometry. Moreover, the description of helium electron resonance is compared to classical mechanics of an oscillating pendulum and to classical electromagnetism of an LC oscillator. With this novel space-time platform, a prospect to join particle physics with classical physics is provided."}
{"text":"\nThis article examines coherence theorems for covariant structures that do not necessarily require the underlying term rewriting system to be terminating or confluent. To achieve this, we offer a novel framework for describing coherence problems in terms of term rewriting systems equipped with a two dimensional congruence. Then, within this model, we demonstrate general solutions to two problems: a decision procedure for commutativity of diagrams in the resulting structure and sufficient conditions for verifying that all diagrams commute. Taking advantage of the proposed approach, we give a new, conceptual proof of coherence theorems for iterated monoidal categories."}
{"text":"We present a theory for the trapped few-fermion systems that successfully constructs effective interactions in order to carry out few- and many-body calculations. We analyze the spectrum of three- and four-particle systems in a confinement, finding agreement with known semi-analytical values in the unitary limit. We extend this method to other scenarios, with different species and more components, as demonstrated by calculations of low-energy states away from the unitary limit and the possible inversion of parity in the ground state. Additionally, we explore the lowest positive-parity states of four fermions, although this may be limited by current computational dimensions."}
{"text":"\nThis paper focuses on understanding how the final mass of gas giant planets is determined in protoplanetary disks. To address this issue, we construct an analytical model which relates the rate of gas accretion onto a planet to the planetary mass, disk viscosity, disk scale height and unperturbed surface density in the disk. Furthermore, utilizing an empirical formula relating surface density and gas accretion rate derived from hydrodynamical simulations of Tanigawa and Watanabe (2002), we carry out a series of simulations analyzing the mass evolution of gas giant planets in viscous disks. Our results indicate that the disk can be divided into three regions, each with its own process for determining the planet's final mass. In the inner region, the planet rapidly reaches a limit before the disk dissipates, with the final mass larger than the mass given by the viscous condition for gap-opening by a factor of 10. In the intermediate region, the gas accretion onto the planet is limited by viscous diffusion while in the outer region, planets capture only minimal amounts of gas to form Neptune-like planets. We provide analytical formulae for the final masses and the boundaries in these regions, allowing for a systematic understanding of the masses of gas giant planets."}
{"text":"\nThis paper presents a new model of Lyman alpha (Lya) luminosity functions (LFs) for hierarchical galaxy formation. We extend a previously established semi-analytic model of galaxy formation by incorporating two effects on the escape fraction of Lya photons from host galaxies - extinction by interstellar dust and galaxy-scale outflow as a result of star formation feedback. We find that this model accurately predicts the observed Lyman alpha LFs of high-z emitters from z ~ 3-6. Additionally, it explains the small evolution of observed LAE Lya LFs compared to the dark halo mass function. Our model suggests that galaxies with strong outflows and a high escape fraction are dominant in the observed LFs. However, our model vastly overpredicts Lyman alpha emitters at z > 6, which we interpret as evidence for the rapid evolution of intergalactic medium (IGM) neutral fraction from x_HI << 1 at z < 6 to a value of order unity at z ~ 6-7."}
{"text":"\nThis study examines the iron core collapse and black hole formation of stars with a variety of anomalous properties, including those of the first stars in the universe and stars produced by merging. This study is focused on the iron-core masses ranging from 3-30Msun and specifically consider isentropic iron cores produced by merging and a Population III star model produced by evolutionary calculation. We solve the equations of general relativistic hydrodynamics and neutrino transfer, with correlations to neutrino reactions measured under spherical symmetry, to explore the details of stellar core collapse and the resulting neutrino emission. Interestingly, massive iron cores with ~10Msun demonstrate evidence of a bounce before black hole formation due to the thermal pressure of nucleons. As a consequence of such massive iron core collapses, the neutronization burst is less remarkable or even negligible while the spectra of neutrinos, aside from the electron neutrino, are softer owing to the electron-positron pair creation before the bounce. We additionally assess the effects of the initial density profile on the collapse, deducing that the larger the density gradient, the sharper the decrease in neutronization burst. Lastly, we discuss how to probe the black hole progenitors through neutrino emission and estimate the event numbers for existing neutrino detectors."}
{"text":"\nThis paper investigates the resonant spin polarization of a two-dimensional hole gas that is subject to a Luttinger Hamiltonian, structural inversion asymmetry and Zeeman splitting in an extrinsic magnetic field. The resonant spin polarization arises from the energy gap between the light and heavy hole bands, producing a peak at a certain critical field value. It is discovered that the Luttinger term and structural inversion asymmetry can lead to the emergence of a rich resonant peak structure and a reduction of the magnetic field at which the resonance occurs. However, the Zeeman splitting tends to shift the resonant spin polarization to a high field and abates these resonant phenomena. Additionally, the magnitude and weight of the peak increases as the temperature drops. It is suggested that this resonance can be experimentally detected in two-dimensional hole gas samples, potentially allowing us to control spin polarization with an external electric field."}
{"text":"\nIn this study, we present results from Gemini integral field spectroscopy and Keck II longslit spectroscopy of the extended emission-line region (EELR) of 4C 37.43, a quasar. The complexity of the ionized gas structures challenge traditional dynamical models, though they can be explained by photoionization due to the quasar nucleus. This photoionization model also suggests that the EELR has a low-metallicity two-phase medium, containing both a low-filled diffuse component and dense clouds that are continually regenerated by low-speed shocks. Additionally, we conclude that the total mass and kinetic energy of the ionized gas is approximately 3x10^10 M_sun and 2x10^58 ergs respectively. Finally, we propose that the quasar-mode of feedback may be an effective means of controlling star formation in the early universe through the production of powerful jets and spherical blast waves."}
{"text":"This paper pinpoints an intriguing analogy between the critical mass of bacterial populations in a generalized Keller-Segel model of chemotaxis and Chandrasekhar's limit for white dwarf stars. The equilibrium states of this model are determined by polytropic configurations consistent with the Tsallis statistics. By referring to the theory of polytropes, this work identifies a unique value of the mass M_c to be interpreted as a limiting mass. For values of the mass M below M_c, the system will either evaporate in an infinite domain or reach equilibrium in a box-confined situation. If the mass is above the M_c, the system will undergo a critical collapse resulting in a Dirac peak of mass M_c accompanied by a halo. This paper presents the fundamental elements of the model and offers a basic explanation of the origin of the critical mass. Further research on the critical dynamics of the generalized Keller-Segel model will be elucidated in a future publication."}
{"text":"\nThis article presents a generalized methodology to generate minimally coupled\nEinstein-scalar field solutions from existing 4-dimensional vacuum solutions\nwith arbitrary cosmological constant, by employing the Buchdahl and Fonarev\ntransformations.

{"text":"This paper investigates the possibility of a relationship between Albert Einstein and early 20th Century avant-garde art movements, exploring both the potential influence his theories could have had on the artists and to what extent the theories were familiar to them. It will also consider the ways artistic practice dovetailed with contemporary beliefs related to mathematics and theoretical physics, as well as the argument that these supposed links between the scientists and the visual arts may have more to do with the proclivities of art historians and critics than any real connections."}
{"text":"This article investigates the validity of a two-band tight-binding (TB) model for the Mn e_g electrons in manganites, which includes the kinetic energy alongside a local \"Hund's rule\" coupling to the t_{2g} core spin and a local coupling to the Jahn-Teller (JT) distortion of the oxygen octahedra. Using full Kohn-Sham band-structure calculated within the local spin-density approximation (LSDA) to density functional theory, and analysis of the effects of magnetic order, JT distortions, and \"GdFeO_3-type\" tilt-rotations of the oxygen octahedra, we show that both JT distortions and Hund's rule coupling are essential for an insulating ground state, and that the hopping amplitudes are independent of magnetic order and JT distortions. We also determine a full set of model parameters from the density functional theory, and find that the \"GdFeO_3-type\" rotations of the oxygen octahedra lead to a substantial reduction of the hopping amplitudes while having no significant deviation from the TB model."}
{"text":"\nThis article studies the electrostatic plasma modes along the open field lines of a rotating neutron star. We explore the Goldreich-Julian charge density under general relativity, finding it is greatest at the polar cap with a more constant level in the subsequent extended region. We then look at the steady state Goldreich-Julian charge density to discover plasma oscillations along the field lines, with plasma frequency closely resembling the gravitational redshift near to the Schwarzschild radius. To investigate further, we derive a second order differential equation from the nonlinear plasma mode along the field lines, which contains a defining term depicting growing plasma modes around the black hole environment. Simultaneously, we find that the Goldreich-Julian charge density produces a propagating plasma mode on the neutron star surface, which is considerably enhanced, but remains almost unimpeded over long distances. Finally, we discuss how to further develop the work by looking at soliton propagation along the open field lines of strongly gravitating objects."}
{"text":"\nIn this paper, the properties of three-dimensional Kerr-de Sitter space with the addition of a gravitational Chern-Simons term is investigated from the perspective of dS\/CFT correspondence. The mass and angular momentum are quantified based on the values of the energy-momentum tensor at the asymptotic infinity, as well as the single cosmological event horizon. Based on the first law of thermodynamics and the usual Hawking temperature, the thermodynamic entropy of the cosmological horizon is examined and the conventional Gibbons-Hawking entropy is seen to be modified. The gravitational Chern-Simons term is also observed to lead to violations of the maximum-mass\/N-bound conjecture, as well as resulting in a chiral three-dimensional cosmology. Additionally, the entropy is computed through a particular Cardy-like formula for a dual CFT in the vicinity of the asymptotic boundary, and certain divergence in the Chern-Simons energy-momentum tensor from existing studies is evidenced."}
{"text":"This article examines the implications of long-range order on alloy and magnetic phase transitions. Using a first principles analysis of the order-disorder transition in alloys, the authors demonstrate that the ordering energy depends on temperature due to thermal vibrations, that zero-point vibrational energy can be included in inter-nuclear potential energy terms and that core energy contributions to the ordering energy are stored in superlattice lines. It is further expounded that the effect of electron-phonon interactions on ordering energy cannot be ignored due to its magnitude relative to ordering energy at transition temperatures and must be incorporated via a current theoretical formalism in order to accurately model temperature related phenomena. The authors also suggest considering an isotope effect for magnetic phase transitions at temperatures below the Debye temperature which was recently observed in magnetic phase transitions. This highlights the importance of acknowledging electron-phonon interactions in all models of magnetism in order to ensure consistency with experiment."}
{"text":"\nThis study presents a critical look at the modified Coulomb potential under the influence of a strong magnetic field. Analyzing two separate regimes of the dynamical mass, namely $|{\\mathbf{q}}_{\\|}^{2}|\\ll m_{dyn.}^{2}\\ll |eB|$ and $m_{dyn.}^{2}\\ll |\\mathbf{q}_{\\|}^{2}|\\ll|eB|$, the vacuum expectation value of the Wilson loop was calculated and compared to the static potential broadened by the Born approximation. Both results showed no discrepancies. In addition, it was found that the angle $\\theta$ between the particle-antiparticle's axis and direction of the magnetic field had an impact on the repulsive behavior of the Coulomb-like potential. For $\\theta=0,\\pi$, the potential was repulsive whereas it had a minimum within the range of angles $]0,\\pi[$. This paper thus provides a new perspective on the way a strong magnetic field affects the modified Coulomb potential."}
{"text":"\nEpitaxial thin films of Bi2FeCrO6, a material with a double-perovskite crystal\nstructure resembling that of BiFeO3, have been prepared via pulsed laser\ndeposition on (100)- and (111)-oriented SrTiO3 substrates. X-ray diffraction\nand cross-section transmission electron microscopy revealed a particular\nFe3+\/Cr3+ ordering in the Bi2FeCrO6 films along the [111] direction. The\ncompositions of Fe and Cr were also found to show variation throughout the\nfilm, forming complementary stripe patterns. The resulting films were free from\nmagnetic iron oxide impurities and contained the correct cationic average\nstochiometry. Additionally, these multiferroic films have been shown to have\ngood ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties, in addition to room\ntemperature magnetic properties, which exhibit an unexpected orientation\ndependence. This is in agreement with ab-initio modelling, which confirms the\nFe3+\/Cr3+ ordering and multifunctional properties of the BFCO films."}
{"text":"\nThis paper presents a complete formalism for the semiclassical analysis of scalar field propagators in arbitrary curved space-time backgrounds. The article also highlights the parallels between finding the propagator in GRQM and solving for propagators in stationary systems in non-relativistic quantum mechanics. This work provides an approach which can be used to evaluate the behavior of quantum systems in curved backgrounds and to explore their implications for the theories of quantum gravity. Lastly, the formalism is applied to the analysis of quantum interference due to the curvature of space-time."}

Such a program is anticipated to further our understanding of neutrino physics, while providing unique experimental capabilities due to the high beam intensity and baseline distances available. The report was initiated by research officers of Brookhaven National Laboratory and Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in April 2006, and includes responses to questions put forth by the Neutrino Scientific Advisory Committee (NuSAG) of the U.S. Department of Energy and National Science Foundation.

{"text":"This article examines the possibility of loop quantum gravity as a potential explanation for the mysterious dark energy driving the expansion of the universe. The core feature of loop quantum gravity is the discrete structure of space, which opens the door to define matter Hamiltonians and address questions regarding the cosmological constant problem. From a more phenomenological perspective, quantum geometry effects may be the origin of dark energy. Tests of this scenario and a quantitative study of quantum gravity can provide predictions for the future of our universe."}
{"text":"\nUsing the GLIMPSE archive of 3.6--8.0micron imaging, an analysis was conducted\non 381 massive protostellar candidates located in the galactic mid-plane. Upon\nexamination, no embedded clusters were identified, however, multiple sources\nwith reddenings of young stellar objects were found in many locations. These\nsources showed infrared spectral indices of $\\alpha$=2--5. A color-magnitude\nanalog plot allowed the detection of 79 IR counterparts of HMPOs. In 75% of\ndetected sources, compact nebulae were observed with core-halo, cometary,\nshell-like and bipolar geometries similar to those found in Ultra-compact HII\nregions. The SEDs of the IR counterparts of HMPOs were best explained by\nYSOs with masses of 8-20\\msun in their Class I stages when compared with 2D\nradiative transfer models, suggesting the large $\\alpha$ values arise from\nreprocessed star\/star+disk emission from dense envelopes. Given the resemblances\nto UCHII regions, it is proposed that the compact infrared nebulae may\nreflect the underlying physical structure of the dense cores and that star\nformation is likely achieved through a combination of molecular and ionised\naccretion components."}
{"text":"\nThe lifetime of a bouncing droplet has been investigated with regards to the acceleration, caused by a vertically oscillating surface, and its effects on air film thickness between the droplet and the bath. It has been observed that when the acceleration increases, the lifetime of the droplet decreases. Using low-pressure sodium lamps, interference fringes revealed the thickness of the air film. Additionally, the droplet's shape evolution and motion of its center of mass were also recorded in order to determine the offset between the deformation and the trajectory. A shorter lifetime was attributed to a smaller air film thickness and a larger phase offset between the maximum deformation and the minimum vertical position of the mass center."}
{"text":"\nBy using the Green Bank Telescope to measure neutral hydrogen absorption against XTE J1810-197, an X-ray pulsar, we have found that the distance to this magnetar is 3.5(+\/-0.5) kpc, in agreement with estimated distances determined from its dispersion measure and X-ray spectra. We have determined a lower limit of $N_{\\rm H} \\ga 4.6 \\times 10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$ for the non-ionized hydrogen column density toward \\magnetar, which is also consistent with X-ray spectra estimates. It is likely that XTE J1810-197 is located near an infrared dark cloud known as G10.74-0.13."}
{"text":"\nThis research shows how variations to reactions involved in helium burning will modify pre-supernova evolution, supernova nucleosynthesis, and solar abundance ratios for elements between 16 and 40 in mass. Using accepted solar abundances from Lodders (2003) instead of Andres & Grevesse (1989), the 12C(a,g) 16O reaction rate and the triple alpha reaction rate were both incorporated to measure the supernova yields and the effects on the core carbon ignition and supernova remnant. This study suggests that an accuracy of 10% or higher is required for experimental determination of the helium burning reacton rates to ensure minimal effects on the yields of these reactions."}
{"text":"This paper explores the development of correlations in systems with conjoined weak long-range interactions, utilizing the BBGKY hierarchy. We find correlations to stem from the finite quantity of particles, leading to kinetic collisional behavior, which we examine with a general kinetic equation for inhomogeneous systems that take into account one-time effects. We also investigate homogeneous systems that do not possess these collective effects, still finding the classic Landau\/Lenard-Balescu equations. Our method analyses physical space instead of Fourier space and furnishes new equations with physical interpretations while isolating important effects such as vicious collisionless relaxation and slower collisional relaxation. We bring forth the connection between the relaxation time and system size in the culmination of our studies."}
{"text":"\nBy employing VINCI\/VLTI interferometry and spectroscopic UV to far-IR photometry, we characterize the three main components of SS Leporis, a close binary experiencing mass transfer from one star to the other, an A star and an M star, as well as a circumstellar shell\/disk. Through interpretation of the visibilities and the Spectral Energy Distribution, we directly assess the M star to have a diameter equal to its Roche Lobe, providing evidence that the star is filling its Roche Lobe. We propose that the observed mass transfer is linked to the luminous A star and shell spectrum seen in the UV and optical spectra, as well as the circum-binary dust disk whose inner region is spatially resolved in our observations. To our knowledge, this experiment marks the first time a star filling its Roche Lobe has been directly observed."}
{"text":"This study explores a computer-based system designed to help medical professionals attain better results during percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) by featuring a virtual projection of the ultrasound needle trajectory onto fluoroscopy images. Experimental trials on a lab phantom, as well as real-life implementation on a patient, show that this system is both reliable and user-friendly. An extensive prospective survey is planned to investigate the system's potential as an educational tool for nephrologists, as well as its general effectiveness."}
{"text":"\nThis paper examines the implications of observing CP violation in the decays of $B^0_d \\to D^+ D^-$ and $B^0_s \\to D^+_s D^-_s$. Recently, the Belle collaboration reported indications of large CP violation in the $B^0_d$ decay, which were not confirmed by BaBar. The first signals of $B^0_s$ were found at the Tevatron. To analyze the allowed region in observable space for CP violation in $B^0_d \\to D^+ D^-$, we provide theoretical estimates of the relevant hadronic penguin parameters and observables. We also discuss strategies to extract CP-violating phases and the interplay with other measurements of CP violation, in addition to exploring the $B^0_q \\to D^+_q D^-_q$ system to determine the $B^0_q$-$\\bar B^0_q$ mixing phases for possible new physics effects."}
{"text":"\nThis paper investigates the deceleration of the blast wave at the 2006 outburst of the RS Ophiuchi recurrent nova, which has been observed spectroscopically at both infrared and X-ray wavelengths. Results reveal that the observed evolution of the remnant can be explained by the diffusive shock acceleration of particles from the blast wave, accompanied by the escape of the most energetic ions from the area. The nonlinear acceleration process is seen to explain the disparity between shock velocities inferred from the IR and X-ray data. The semi-analytic model of nonlinear diffusive shock acceleration developed by Berezhko & Ellison was used to compute the maximum energy that accelerated electrons and protons could reach shortly after the outburst, which is found to be as high as a few TeV. Examination of postshock temperatures with RXTE\/PCA and Swift\/XRT indicates a moderate acceleration efficiency."}
{"text":"\nThe aim of this paper is to investigate pairs (X,Y) of ADET Dynkin diagrams and the S-matrix that is associated with them to determine the expected conformal invariant limit at high energy. We also explore q-hypergeometric series and modular functions, and the overlap between them, as well as investigating whether certain functions f_{A,B,C} with rational entries can be modular. By using the representation theory of Lie algebras and related Yangians, we are able to explicitly find the solutions to the algebraic equations associated with the (D_m, A_n) model. Our results demonstrate that they are consistent with those that arise in physics, as well as confirming that one of the modular functions f_{A,B,C} is a character of a rational conformal field theory."}
{"text":"\n\nBy investigating the quasiparticle and dynamical magnetic properties of the  optimally electron-doped Pr$_{0.88}$LaCe$_{0.12}$CuO$_4$ through experimental measurements and theoretical calculations, we demonstrate that the conventional fermiology approach fails to explain the magnetic fluctuations in these n-type high-$T_c$ materials. To gain insight, we conduct tunneling experiments on the same sample where a dynamical magnetic resonance had been reported, then use other published photoemission data to characterize the fermionic quasiparticle excitations in great detail. A comparison of the theoretical expectations and measurements reveal a striking discrepancy: the standard fermiology predicts a step-like feature instead of the sharp resonance peak, underestimates the resonance intensity by a factor of ten, shows an unreasonable temperature dependence of the resonance, and assigns the majority of the spectral weight to the incommensurate wings, which has never been found in the electron-doped materials. These results point to a quantum-mechanical interplay between antiferromagnetic and superconducting orders and suggest that the fermiology approach cannot explain the magnetic fluctuations in n-type high-$T_c$ superconductors."}
{"text":"\nThis thesis presents a novel approach to protein multiple sequence alignment called M_Al. This method takes into account the chemical or structural affinity between amino acids, which is determined by breaking down amino acids into sub-groups with successive derivations. These properties can be user-defined or predefined, like those employed in the analysis described in this document. Starting from a set of the 20 naturally occurring amino acids, they are divided on the basis of polarity\/hydrophobic index, with increasing resolution up to four levels of division. Furthermore, a scheme based on physical\/structural properties is used, such as solvent exposure, lateral chain mobility and secondary structure tendency, to compare the chemical scheme. Each position in the alignment is assigned a score depending on the contribution of each level of selectivity for individual properties. In addition, the method has been tested in biological cases, with benchmark programs written in the Python language."}
{"text":"This paper provides an analysis of the structure and dynamics of the Sun's open magnetic field in terms of its topological constraints. We discuss the general assumptions upon which the corona and solar wind relationship is based, and propose two conjectures pertaining to the structure of coronal holes. Taking into account these conjectures, we further explore the topology of open field regions and make a number of predictions regarding their behavior. Finally, we discuss how reconnection is the main factor in enforcing the constraints for the field's topology."}
{"text":"\nIn this article, we evaluate the tensor modes of perturbations in universes governed by Loop Quantum Cosmology, deriving the relevant equation and considering the effects of quantum corrections. We find that super-adiabatic amplification of tensor modes is weaker compared to the classical result. Disregarding the quantum corrections to the equation for tensor modes, we scrutinize their production analytically during the super-inflationary period induced by Loop Quantum Gravity. Our primary finding is a spectrum of gravitons fashioned by a hard branch. Exploring this spectrum numerically, we observe its strong dependence on the quantum numbers and values of $\\Omega_{\\text{gw}}(\\nu_{\\text{max}})$ reaching up to $\\sim 10^{-1}$ for highest frequencies. We compare our findings with recent results from the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) to see if quantum effects in the early Universe can be tested."}
{"text":"\nThis paper is concerned with developing an equation that tracks the transformation of a four-component Stokes vector in a weakly anisotropic and smoothly varying medium. This equation, derived from the quasi-isotropic approximation of the geometric optics method, stands to generalize the results of past studies regarding the normal propagation of electromagnetic waves in stratified media. Its accuracy extends to curvilinear rays with torsion, and it is equipped with the ability to model normal mode conversion in inhomogeneous media. Remarkably, its expression for the Stokes vector can be likened to the Bargmann-Michel-Telegdi equation for the precession of relativistic spin, while the equation for the three-component Stokes vector resembles the Landau-Lifshitz equation used to measure spin precession in ferromagnetic systems. The theory is applied in the context of analyzing polarization evolution in a magnetized plasma, and its basic non-Abelian features, illustrated using some easy-to-grasp examples, are highlighted."}
{"text":"Recent Monte Carlo simulations of the first-order Fermi particle acceleration process at relativistic shocks have provided new insights into the origin of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). While a simplified model of particle acceleration appears to generate power-law distributions with \"universal\" spectral indices across a wide range of energies, a more realistic consideration of the turbulent magnetic fields and field structures at the shock suggests that UHECR production at relativistic shock waves is quite inefficient. Consequently, while relativistic shocks are efficient at producing particles of lower energy, they are not expected to be the primary sources of UHECRs due to the steep, cut-off spectra generated by superluminal shocks."}
{"text":"\nThrough Particle-In-Cell simulations, we investigate the production of magnetic turbulence from cosmological ion streaming presented at the shocks of supernoava remnants. We are attempting to verify the nonresonant short wavelength wave modes found by Bell (2004, 2005). We are studying the evolution of this turbulence, as well as its influence on cosmic ray trajectories. Characterizing the turbulence produced upstream is a key element in understanding shocks, thermal particle injection and heating processes, as well as the potential of accelerated particles beyond the \"knee\" of the cosmic ray spectrum. Our simulations show that the generated magnetic field is slower to grow than MHD models predict, and the amplitude of the turbulence saturates at around dB\/B~1, less than the equilibrium of the upstream plasma."}
{"text":"\nWe study Coulomb gas computations of three-point and four-point functions in the SL(2,R) WZNW model. We use Schur polynomials to express ghost contributions to various correlators and Aomoto integrals in the complex plane to compute them. We then utilize monodromy invariance to extend the number of screening operators and verify the accuracy of the results with the bootstrap approach. Additionally, we propose an alternative pathway for constructing non-conserving n-point functions with wound number conservation. This method is tested for n = 3 and is independent of the points of insertion, hinting at the potential to modify background charges and thus, violate winding number conservation."}
{"text":"\nInvestigating the Type Ia supernova SN 2005hj, we analyze optical spectra and ROTSE-IIIb unfiltered light curves of this \"Branch-normal\" event. Results from our analysis suggest two classes of normal-bright supernovae Ia - a majority class explained by delayed detonation and deflagration models, and a distinct subclass supported by pulsating delayed detonation and merger scenarios. Both classes show a long velocity plateau in the SiII minimum with an unvarying line profile. If these observed relations are confirmed, they could provide a means of distinguishing the two groups of events. We further discuss the potential implications found in cosmological studies at large, including possible differences in the peak luminosity to light curve width relation."}
{"text":"\n\nThis study investigated the response of an Ag monolayer on $Au(100)$ to a periodic variation of the chemical potential, $\\mu(t) = \\mu_{coex} + \\mu_{o}sin(2\\Pi t\/\\tau)$, with $\\mu_{o}$ and $\\tau$ corresponding to the amplitude and period of the signal sweep, respectively. Using Monte Carlo simulations, the authors discovered that with relatively short $\\tau$ values and low enough $\\mu_{o}$ amplitudes, the system demonstrated a hysteretic behavior that was identified as Dynamically Ordered States (DOS), where the relaxation time of the corresponding metastable state was found to be $\\tau_{relax} > \\tau$. With increasing values of either $\\mu_{o}$ or $\\tau$, however, the Ag coverage gently follows the oscillatory signal which then designates the system to enter the Dynamically Disordered States (DDS) - displaying almost symmetrical limiting cycles. This breaking of symmetry between cycles mediated by the external signal allows us to discuss Dynamic Phase Transitions, analogous to those encountered in magnetic systems placed under changing external magnetic fields. A finite-size scaling analysis revealed the existence of a crossover behavior between DOS and DDS at $T = 300 K$, and the authors produced a diagram showing the location of the two kinds of states in the $(\\mu, \\tau)$ plane."}
{"text":"This article investigates the propagation of damage within a confined Ising model under the presence of short-range magnetic fields acting on the opposing walls. Monte Carlo simulations are utilized to look into the effects of the invisible interface between different magnetization orientations brought on by the competing fields, with a well defined wetting transition at $T_w(h)$ resulting. It is discovered that the interface serves as a catalyst for damage, greatly enlarging the damaged area. Using a finite-size scaling approach, the critical points for damage spreading are revealed to be placed within the non-wet phase in comparison to the familiar Ising model's order-disorder transition critical temperature."}
{"text":"\nIn this study, we employ molecular dynamics simulations of the extended simple point charge model of water to examine breakdowns in the Stokes-Einstein (SE) and Stokes-Einstein-Debye (SED) relations at low temperature. We discover that both relations break down for both 7% of the ``fastest'' and 7% of the ``slowest'' molecules, a phenomenon which appears to be generalized across all scales of mobility. In this lower temperature range, the SE and SED relations are replaced with the ``fractional'' SE and SED relations; $D_t\\sim(\\tau\/T)^{-\\xi_t}$ and $D_r\\sim(\\tau\/T)^{-\\xi_r}$ where $\\xi_t\\approx0.84<1$ and $\\xi_r\\approx0.75<1$. Additionally, a decoupling between the rotational and translational motion of the molecules is observed. We also note that the probability of a molecule being identified as both translationally and rotationally fastest increases with the advancement of the decoupling. Through the introduction of a time-dependent version of the SE and SED relations, as well as a time-dependent measure of the extent of decoupling, we find that the decoupling and the SE\/SED breakdowns are linked to the dynamical heterogeneities and begin at the time scale in which cages end and diffusion starts."}
{"text":"\nThis article presents a new approach for solving inverse problems in network tomography by applying linear projections to marginal distributions of a sequence of one-dimensional observed data. The general identifiability of this method is discussed, alongside the statistical efficiency of the one-dimensional projections design. For two Gaussian tomography models, the outcomes of our simulation studies show that this method produces estimators that are equivalent in terms of accuracy to those derived from the joint distribution of the observed data. The two instances considered were traffic demand tomography and network delay tomography, and the results obtained suggest that these estimators are reliable for practical applications."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate the impact of Dark Matter and Dark Energy on the future of nearby large scale structures through constrained N-body simulations. Our calculations compare a Cold Dark Matter and Cosmological Constant (LCDM) model with an Open CDM (OCDM) model with an equivalent matter density (Omega_m = 0.3) and Hubble constant (h = 0.7). Due to varying expansion rates in the two models, the Local Group is projected to recede from Virgo at a constant rate in the OCDM scenario, and exponentially in the LCDM scenario. We observe that, in comoving coordinates, the future large scale structure will remain similar to the present structure, yet clusters will become more separated and filament widths will decrease. Our findings heavily suggest that the long-term development of cosmic structure is mostly defined by matter density, regardless of the current accelerating or non-accelerating dynamics of the LCDM and OCDM models."}
{"text":"In this article, we explore the divergence from equilibrium of quantum impurity models in the context of energy dissipation and time-reversal symmetry-breaking. We begin by examining how entropy production is usually overlooked when this type of model is treated. Subsequently, we use thermodynamic arguments to determine the rate of entropy production and demonstrate, with the aid of the previously established scattering framework, that the rate can be analyzed in terms of the Shannon entropy and Kullback-Leibler divergence of the nonequilibrium distribution functions. Through our investigations, we prove that the entropy production is always positive in any nonequilibrium steady-state. To conclude, we analyze two models - Resonance Level and Kondo - in terms of the results obtained."}
{"text":"\nThe Cassini Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS) has been observing unprecedented temporal and azimuthal variability in the composition of the Io plasma torus over the course of a three-month period. Irregular azimuthal variations in plasma composition occur with a periodicity of 10.07-hours and appear to be modulated at the beat frequency between the System III period and the observed 10.07-hours period. To explore the implications of these observations, we present a model for this variability by postulating two azimuthal variations in the number of super-thermal electrons in the torus. Specifically, we suggest the existence of a primary variation that subcorotates with a period of 10.07 hours, and a secondary variation that remains fixed in System III longitude. Our model incorporates these two electron variations and can effectively reproduce the observed temporal and azimuthal variations."}
{"text":"The proposed joining of GLAST and the EXIST mission, part of the Beyond Einstein Program, could offer a unique opportunity to measure Blazars' soft X-ray synchrotron and hard X-ray inverse Compton components simultaneously. EXIST's full-sky per orbit 3-600 keV imaging and \"nuFnu\" capability is on par with GLAST at 10-100GeV. This allows researchers to determine the intervening diffuse infrared photon field responsible for any observed high-energy spectral breaks, thus yielding insight into the cosmic diffuse extra-galactic background light, jet physics, and the origin of the more than 100 MeV gamma-ray background that likely originates from jets and jet-dominated sources. The current overview of EXIST and its potential synergy with GLAST is presented."}
{"text":"\nThis article explores the potential unification of Pythagorean theorem and Kepler's law in two-dimensional spacetime as applied to an atom's electrons. A duality equation, involving symmetric and interwoven wave functions, describes the movement of electrons which takes the form of a matter state transformation cycle. These principles of motion are stated as equivalents to each other and are brought together with trigonometry in the atomic spacetime. To provide the conventional physics viewpoint, this article attempts to connect electron motion in an atomic spacetime to spherical volume undulation in Euclidean geometry and examines the possible derivation of a central force expression from the primary wave function of an electron. This could potentially challenge the accuracy of the well-known Coulomb's law."}
{"text":"The suitability of SSP models for extragalactic astronomy is tested by researching 48 Galactic globular clusters, where integrated spectra and Lick indices are used. Comparing results from SSP models from Thomas, Maraston & Korn, Lee & Worthey, and Vazdekis et al. allows us to decide if the models are consistently reliable. The precision of measuring metallicity is deemed satisfactory, yet ages and alpha-element abundances show variable results. Nevertheless, the application of published Lick index response functions enables the approximation of feasible alpha-element abundances. Additionally, an analysis of the age-metallicity and [$\\alpha$\/Fe]-metallicity relationships is conducted, as well as an examination of the effects that variable model horizontal branch morphology may have."}

Modern nuclear-physics-based and astrophysics-free r-process models are assessed, and the one- or multidimensional spherical or non-spherical explosion simulations of a core collapse supernova of massive stars is used to explain the production of stable (and some long-lived radioactive) neutron-rich nuclides. The possibility of r-nuclide synthesis during the decompression of the matter of neutron stars following their merging is considered."}
{"text":"\nExploring the potential of establishing a connection between black hole phenomena and strings in AdS space, we analyze the Hagedorn behavior of thermal AdS_3 bosonic string by studying the 1-loop partition function of SL(2,R) WZW model. We discover that the Hagedorn temperature varies proportionally with the AdS radius. At its peak, the resulting density of states, which is similar to that of strings in flat space, is controlled by space-like long string configurations. We later discuss a strings\/black hole correspondence in AdS space via the Hagedorn thermodynamics and deduce the resulting black hole's size relative to the AdS radius and string scale. Moreover, strings on a BTZ background gained through SL(2,Z) transformation lead to a tachyonic divergence for a BTZ black hole of string scale size."}
{"text":"\nThis theoretical study of the novel one-dimensional Ca$_3$CoRhO$_6$ and Ca$_3$FeRhO$_6$ systems was conducted for the purpose of understanding the importance of spin-orbit coupling in their insulating antiferromagnetic states. Calculations with the closed shell high-spin $d^5$ (Fe$^{3+}$) and low-spin $t_{2g}^{6}$ (Rh$^{3+}$) configurations produced results in line with the expected behavior of Ca$_3$FeRhO$_6$ and a strong tendency for Co to be $d^7$ (Co$^{2+}$) in Ca$_3$CoRhO$_6$. Spin-orbit coupling was shown to lift the orbital degeneracy enabling local spin density approximation + Hubbard U (LSDA+U) simulations to generate a band gap. It was found that the orbital contribution to the magnetism of Ca$_3$CoRhO$_6$ was substantial and a model for the differing intra-chain magnetisms was proposed."}
{"text":"\nThis study examines the possible role of cosmic rays in the thermal and chemical evolution of primordial gas. It is proposed that an early population of cosmic rays may introduce enough free electrons to enable the formation of molecular hydrogen, therefore cooling the gas to temperatures as low as 100K. A code was developed to simulate these effects, with findings that cosmic rays can help with cooling under specific conditions, for example an intensity of dissociating photons less than 10^(-18)erg cm^(-2) s^(-1), an initial temperature of ~ 10^3 K, number densities greater than or equal to 1 cm^(-3) and cosmic ray sources producing a rate greater than 10^(-33) erg cm^(-3) s^(-1)."}
{"text":"\nRecent XMM-Newton observations of the neutron star RX J1856.5-3754 have uncovered 7 s pulsations, revealing the star's underlying geometry. By comparing the variability of our model, which assumes a magnetic, hydrogen atmosphere and two simple dipolar-like distributions of magnetic field and temperature, with the observed brightness variations, our analysis constrains the angles between the rotation and magnetic axes or those between the rotation axis and the observer to be < 6 deg and 20-45 deg, respectively. This intriguing result gives new insight into RX J1856.5-3754 being a normal radio pulsar and highlights it as an interesting candidate for observation by upcoming X-ray polarization missions."}
{"text":"\nIn this article, we research ideas that can increase the lifetime differences\nin the neutral B meson systems ($B_q$--$\\bar{B}_q$ where $q = d,s$) above their standard model values. We examine two models - a scalar leptoquark and $\\lambda''$-type R-parity violating supersymmetry - that can allow for new physics interactions which give flavour dependent decays. Our findings imply that the scalar leptoquark model can provide a lifetime difference in $\\Delta\\Gamma_s\/\\Gamma_s$ that can reach the experimental upper limit and around $2.5\\%$ in $\\Delta\\Gamma_d\/\\Gamma_d$, while conforming to a CP-violating phase ($\\beta_s$) between $-45^\\circ$ and $20^\\circ$. In contrast, R-parity violating supersymmetry cannot improve the lifetime differences, but might increase the value of $\\beta_s$ up to $\\sim \\pm 20^\\circ$, potentially attainable by $B$ factories and LHCb. Other results include the acquisition of bounds on combinations of new physics couplings and predictions of higher $B_{s\/d} \\to \\tau^+ \\tau^-$ branchin ratios."}
{"text":"\nThis paper presents a novel two-step algorithm, TRUFAS, to detect planetary transits quickly and accurately in light curves. First, a continuous wavelet transformation of the detrended light curve is employed to select an optimum scale, and secondly a period search is performed in the selected wavelet transformation. The detrending of the light curves is based on Fourier filtering or a discrete wavelet transformation. Our results showed that TRUFAS is able to effectively recognize transits in a large collection of 999 standard light curves that simulate CoRoT data, regardless of differences in pre-processing or wavelet transform selection scale. It is thus a reliable and reliable method for the analysis of large data sets from space or ground experiments with long durations of target planets producing multiple transits."}
{"text":"\nIn this paper, we investigate finite covers with respect to an Aut(W)-congruence r on a first-order structure W and define the almost-free finite covers of W with respect to r. We show how to construct such covers and provide a description on their isomorphism, as well as examining their bindings groups which are equal at any point to a simple non-abelian regular permutation group G. This allows for the biinterpretability of the set of ordered n-tuples of distinct elements from a countable set when it is regarded as a structure with automorphism group Sym(Omega). We also use a result of Evans and Hrushovski from their paper \"On the automorphism groups of finite covers\" to see that these elements, which generalize free finite covers, can be constructed without expending any extra effort."}
{"text":"\nThe analysis of the pseudospectra of non-selfadjoint operators has relevance in various disciplines such as quantum mechanics, random matrix theory and fluid dynamics. This paper examines how the occurrence of pseudospectra for non-selfadjoint semiclassical differential operators can be extended to systems with principal type symbols. Specifically, the behavior of the resolvent for these systems is studied, with a particular focus on investigating the effects of quasi-symmetrizability and systems of subelliptic type. Results show that for scalar operators, the quasimodes appear as a consequence of the bracket condition not being satisfied, while for systems of semiclassical operators, the resolvent has the property of blowing up, apart from a nowhere dense set of degenerate values."}
{"text":"\nIn this study we explore a Gauge-Higgs Unification (GHU) model on the orbifold $S^{1}\/Z_{2}$ that is based on the extended Standard Model (SM) gauge group $G_{SM}^{ex}=SU(2)_{L}\\times U(1)_{Y} \\times SO(3)_{F}$, where $SO(3)_{F}$ is treated as a chiral gauged flavour symmetry. Implementing the orbifolding and imposing additional boundary conditions, the single gauge group SU(7) is broken down to the SM gauge group $G_{SM}^{ex}$. The model incorporates electroweak and flavour interactions as well as Higgs interactions with a compactification scale of O(1) TeV. Consequently, the extra dimension thereby consists of only two points - the orbifold fixed points. As a result of the blockspin transformations, the parallel transporters (PT) in the extra dimension become nonunitary, and a Higgs potential spontaneously emerges. There is also a reduction of 48 adjoint reps of the SU(7) group to 35 + 6 + $\\bar{6}$ + 1, which leads to three $SU(2)_{L}$ Higgs doublets, one for each flavour. These doublets serve as a substitute for the SM Higgs. When $G_{SM}^{ex}$ is broken down to $U(1)_{em}$, an exponential gauge boson mass splitting results. This breaking also leads to flavour gauge boson masses significantly above the compactification scale, thus suppressing FCNCs at the tree-level. Fermion masses and CKM mixing angles can likewise be calculated, which predicts a large Higgs sector of 30 particles and a weak mixing angle $\\theta =0.125$."}
{"text":"\nIn this analysis, we employed the meanfield approximation to study a kinetic Ising ferromagnet responded to an oscillating magnetic field. Estimate of the transition temperature as a function of the amplitude and frequency was computed with the help of the sixth order Runge-Kutta-Felberg method. Plotting the data, the phase boundary was observed to expand as frequency intensifies, containing an inflection point that divides the type of transition. Upon further inspection, this inflection point was identfied as the tricritical point (TCP). We demonstrate that this inflection point can be used to reliably approximate the position of TCP. As the frequency decreases, the dynamic phase boundary was reduced and in the zero-frequency limit, it was seen that this boundary gravitated towards the temperature of the coercive field."}
{"text":"\nWe present a study on the kinetic theory of Hamiltonian systems with long-range interactions, where we derive a kinetic equation from a quasilinear theory which allows us to calculate memory effects in inhomogeneous systems. In the thermodynamic limit with N tending toward infinity, this equation reduces to the Vlasov equation which describes collisionless systems. Through this, we analyze the phase mixing and violent relaxation leading to a quasi-stationary state (QSS). We further interpret the physical nature of the QSS in terms of Lynden-Bell's statistical theory, and discuss the incomplete relaxation problem. Additionally, we consider a test particle in a thermal bath, where we calculate the diffusion tensor and friction force, as well as derive a Fokker-Planck equation. Our approach yields a formalism that remains in physical space and is applicable to spatially inhomogeneous systems with long correlation time."}
{"text":"\nThis article examines the potential of using epidemiology tools, methods, and theory to monitor and manage virtual plagues in Massively Multiplayer Online Games (MMOGs). We will explore the idea of using these measures to gain a better understanding of how virtual plagues spread in a synthetic population, and to determine what strategies game developers can use to exert control over them. To do this, we will address the differences between real-world epidemics and virtual plagues, as well as potential ways to minimize the effects of a virtual plague. Ultimately, our goal is to understand the dynamics of virtual plagues, not to try to eliminate or reduce their effects."}
{"text":"\nThrough observations of the 100-m radio telescope in Effelsberg at 4.85 GHz, this study examined possible anomalies in the magnetic fields of five large Virgo Cluster spiral galaxies (NGC 4501, NGC 4438, NGC 4535, NGC 4548 and NGC 4654). Distorted magnetic field structures were found in all galaxies and interaction-induced magnetized outflows detected in two of them. Magnetic fields are useful for tracing weak interactions that are not evidenced by other observations, including ram pressure and tidal effects from the nearby Virgo Cluster that affect the galaxies' evolution."}
{"text":"\nThis study conducted an extensive investigation of suspected A-type binary systems, using high-resolution spectroscopy from ELODIE and MUSICOS and CCD photometry, to search for pulsations. Out of the 32 objects surveyed, 8 were spectroscopic binaries, one of which is a close binary exhibiting eclipses, and 3 were classified as Delta Scuti pulsators. One star in particular, HD 217860, was found to contain multiple periodic photometric and spectroscopic variations, with up to eight frequencies present in two large photometric datasets. This Delta Scuti star also showed signs of amplitude and\/or frequency modulation. It is suspected that radial overtone modes are exciting the two strongest frequencies detected."}
{"text":"This paper proposes a variable selection approach that integrates prior constraint information into the lasso method. It combines sample and prior data to identify significant variables for responses within a smaller space containing the true parameters. Additionally, this method enhances the accuracy of selecting the true model. It can be implemented using constrained quadratic programming methods and the initial estimator can be calculated using least square or Monte Carlo methods. Moreover, not only can this procedure be used with linear models but also with generalized linear models, Cox models, quantile regression models, and more by employing Wang and Leng (2007)'s LSA, a technique that transforms these models into estimates of linear models. The idea of combining sample and prior information can also be applied to further modified lasso procedures. A few examples are provided to illustrate how prior constraint information can be included in variable selection operations."}
{"text":"\nThis study examines the discord between SN1987A and the confirmed pulsar PSR J0751+1807, which suggests a maximum mass of cold neutron stars of 1.5M_sun due to kaon condensing in the stellar core. In contrast, the evaluation of PSR J0751+1807 gives a value greater than 2M_sun. Through evaluation of two models of dense matter with high-density softening, kaon condensation and deconfinement of quarks, this research proposes two scenarios of neutron star formation. In the first, the S-phase forms rapidly in the supernova core, giving a maximum mass of 1.5M_sun, which is invalidated by PSR J0751+1807. In the second, nucleation of the S-phase at neutron star birth is too slow and it remains a non-strange N-phase. Consequently, stellar mass can increase beyond the critical value of 2M_sun via accretion. This N-phase model reconciles SN1987A and PSR J0751+1807, resolving the existing conflict between the two."}
{"text":"\nThis research presents 13CO observations of 854 candidate massive young stellar objects (MYSOs) located in the third and fourth quadrants of the southern hemisphere. The RMS survey reveals emission of the molecule in 751 of these sources, yielding a total of 2185 detectable components with a signal-to-noise ratio of at least 3. The majority of sources (455, or 60%) display multiple emission profiles in line with the assessment that a large number of molecular clouds exist along their line of sight. A criterion is applied to pinpoint single components out of these multiples, allowing for the derivation of kinematic velocities in an estimated 580 sources, or ~80% of the detections. Utilizing the Brand an Blitz (1993) data for rotation curves and radial velocities, individual kinematic distances are calculated for the detected components. On the other hand, further lines may be required to clarify the kinematic characteristics of the other 171 sources."}
{"text":"\nThis work introduces a technique for carrying out temporal runtime verification using monadic difference logic. This algorithm involves three steps. First, a bounded temporal logic formula is converted into a first-order monadic logic, given by a set of difference inequalities. Second, the formula is amended each time the timed run advances, through computing the corresponding state and time current values. Finally, the ensuing formulae are determined to be either tautological or unsatisfiable by means of a specialized monadic difference decision procedure. To assist in this process, an algorithm has been devised based on Difference Decision Diagrams. This approach is complete when facing homogeneously monadic formulae and approximate in other cases, meaning that not all tautologies and unsatisfiable formulae are captured in the earliest point of runtime verification. Moreover, the proposed solution surpasses existing rewritings and makes use of efficient decision structures working towards practical applications such as business software."}
{"text":"This study examines the conformation of individual polyelectrolyte macromolecules in aqueous solutions of tetravalent salts via the application of a coarse-grained model in conjunction with Langevin Dynamics simulations.  Results suggest a classification of three distinct categories of chains based on their stiffness: flexible, semi-flexible and rigid. The worm-like chain model and Odijk-Skolnick-Fixman (OSF) theory effectively predicted the end-to-end distance at lower salt concentrations. Additionally, compared to a flexible chain, a semi-flexible chain extended less in the low salt range and reached a similar dimension as the neutral polymer in a high salt region, regardless of rigidity. Both local and global conformations of the single polyelectrolytes were observed to be affected by the stiffness level, with a zigzag local structure in the presence of salt for flexible chains and a smooth local formation for semi-flexible chains. Furthermore, the stiffness level had a significant impact on the coil-globule transition, for which a discrete change was seen for semi-flexible chains, versus a continuous change for flexible chains. Finally, a state diagram was created summarizing the effects of stiffness and salt concentration on the conformation of single polyelectrolytes."}
{"text":"This paper covers the development of a novel searching technique for retrieving semi-structured textual data. The proposed solution finds the k most similar documents to a given query, by utilizing vector spaces with associated user-defined, dynamic weights. This allows for a higher level of specificity of the user's desired results. A variant of the cluster-pruning technique is taken as baseline, in order to scale the solution to large corpora of documents. An alternative approach is presented, that involves a clustering algorithm based on the furthest point first heuristic of the metric k-center problem. Experiments have shown this to be a more efficient approach than the baseline method, and also increased pre-processing speeds by a factor of at least thirty."}
{"text":"\nIn this work, we explore how discrete-time quantum walks can be implemented on Eulerian and directed graphs with free-traveling tails. For such graphs, the walks can be studied using scattering theory, with the probability of entering a node from one tail and exiting from another obtained from the associated scattering matrix. We describe how the modification of graphs can be evaluated by analyzing the effects it has on the scattering matrix, such as removing two tails and replacing them with an edge or cutting an edge and introducing two tails. Ultimately, it is demonstrated how any two graphs can be compared in a 2-dimensional space by a larger graph placed in parallel configuration and performing a quantum walk on it - a kind of interferometric process - to analyze the combination of the individual parts."}
{"text":"This work presents a comprehensive, four-epoch study of the red giant oxygen-rich star, S Ori, employing mid-infrared interferometry with VLTI\/MIDI and radio interferometry with the VLBA to measure the photospheric, molecular layer, dust shell, and SiO maser shell properties. Our results suggest a large increase in mass loss and dust formation close to the photospheric surface near the minimum visual phase, with Al2O3 dust grains co-located with the molecular gas and SiO maser shells, and a more expanded dust shell after visual maximum. While silicon appears to be mostly in a gaseous form, we find no evidence of silicate grains."}
{"text":"This paper reviews the present condition and physics background of the muon (g-2) experiment, noting a noteworthy disagreement between the experiment and theories of 3.4 standard deviations. A new Brookhaven E969 experiment is planned with the aim of determining a more detailed examination of this discrepancy by shrinking the margin of error by up to a factor of two while still preserving the central value. This article also outlines possible theories beyond the Standard Model, and precisely how a more accurate assessment of (g-2) can give greater insight into these theories and findings from the Large Hadron Collider. Ultimately, this paper sketches the plans for a more advanced experiment and offers a compelling case for the physics behind it."}
{"text":"\nThis paper presents the results of a spectroscopic survey of four faint Milky Way satellites - Boo, UMaI, UMaII, and Wil1 - using the DEIMOS spectrograph on the Keck telescope. We collected radial velocities of probable members of these four satellites that are precise to a few km\/s for stars up to 22 magnitudes in i-band, and for half of these stars we also estimated their metallicities within a tolerance of 0.2 dex. UMAII is of particular interest, with a systemic radial velocity consistent with recent simulations of its progenitor, the Orphan Stream. The other three satellites, including Willman 1, display velocity dispersions that reveal them to be dark-matter dominated systems, and in the case of Wil1, a dwarf galaxy or remnant with a mass-to-light ratio of 700 and total mass of ~5x10^5 Msun - thus making it the least massive satellite galaxy known to date. This suggests that the 10^7 Msun limit of Milky Way and Andromeda satellites may only be an observational limit and that fainter, lower-mass systems may exist in the Local Group. To conclusively prove this, more modelling and a search for any potential extra-tidal stars are necessary."}
{"text":"\nThis study examines the possible elimination of Eupelmus orientalis Crawford by Eupelmus vuilleti Crawford (Hymenoptera : Eupelmidae) in the storage systems of Ni\\'eb\\'e (Vigna unguiculata Walp). Ni\\'eb\\'e is a food leguminous plant cultivated in tropical Africa for its high protein content. The primary issue regarding production is preservation of harvests, which are typically destroyed by pests (bruchids). Four entomophagous species were observed, one of which--- E. orientalis---was most abundant (72%) at the start of storage, followed by E. vuilleti (12%) and D. Basalis Rondoni, Pteromalidae (16%). Over the course of storage, the population of E. orientalis declined and eventually disappeared within two months. Compared to D. Basalis, the population of E. vuilleti grew and demonstrated ovicide and larvicide behaviours. It is possible that this behaviour is responsible for the decreased presence of E. orientalis. While this species could be a valuable control agent of bruchids, this study showed that E. vuilleti did not engage in ovicide and larvicide behaviour when finding exclusively E. orientalis host already parasitized. Therefore, the disappearance of E. orientalis could not be attributed to the presence of E. vuilleti."}

{"text":"\nThis article examines the concept of selective control in a heterogeneous cell population by considering cell death, or apoptosis, as an example. An analysis is conducted on the impact that superposition, non-linearity, and feedback have on statistics involved in the signaling of apoptosis in these populations. Using both exhaustive search and linear programming methods, two approaches are presented for optimizing selective control. By manipulating a few genes within the apoptosis network significant levels of selectivity can be achieved. We additionally investigate the statistics of gene combinations in order to develop general control strategies, and determine that weak populations receive the best results when controlling the least sensitive nodes, while strong populations benefit from targeting the more sensitive nodes. Suggestions are made for applying the finding of this research in experiments and for the development of closed-loop control systems."}
{"text":"\nIn Escherichia coli, bacterial chemotaxis plays a fundamental role in signal transduction and research has revealed the presence of precise adaptation across a population, while single cells display substantial fluctuating behavior (Korobkova et al. 2004, Nature, 428, 574). Through the use of a stochastic model, our investigation found that this fluctuating behavior is an unavoidable consequence of the architecture of this adaptive system which includes methylation and demethylation reactions operating beyond first-order kinetics. This results in a sigmoidal activation curve that amplifies the intrinsic stochasticity of the system and increases the duration of response to small stimuli. This, in turn, exhibits the greatest chemotactic response with the greatest variation in behavior. Through large-scale simulations of digital bacteria, it has additionally been proposed that the chemotaxis network is fine-tuned to optimise the stochastic spread of cells and the cellular response to attractant gradients."}
{"text":"\nThis paper looks at how stellar evolution codes can be used to estimate the initial mass range of super-asymptotic giant branch (SAGB) stars capable of sparking an electron capture supernova (ECSN). We constructed synthetic SAGB models in order to study their evolution from the ignition of thermal pulses until their cores either reach the Chandrasekhar mass or are uncovered by a stellar wind. After collecting and analyzing data from different stellar models, we determined the SAGB initial mass range to be 7.5 - 9.25\\msun. We estimate that ECSNe make up around 4% of all supernovae in the local universe. We also considered the uncertainty in this number owing to the third dredge-up efficiency and ABG mass loss to set an upper limit of ~20%."}
{"text":"\nThis essay examines the possibilities of detecting a uniform motion relative to a homogeneous condensed matter system by internal observers within the medium. To do so, a Michelson-Morley interferometer is constructed out of quasi-particles in order to analyse the effects a Lorentz-FitzGerald contraction may have upon the resulting data. It is concluded that such observers cannot detect their absolute state of motion. As a result, a fully defined relativistic world can emerge out of a Newtonian laboratory system. This article ponders the various levels of description in physics, including exploration into quantum gravity."}

With the first-year data of 1.27x10^20 POT, atmospheric neutrino oscillation parameters were measured: |delta m^2_32|=2.74^(+0.44)_(-0.26) x 10^-3 eV^2 and sin^2(2theta_23)>0.87 (68% C.L.). Moreover, the neutrino velocity was established to be (v-c)\/c = (5.1 +\/- 2.9) x 10^-5 (68% C.L.) by comparing the arrival times of the beam in the two detectors.

{"text":"\nThe physical properties of a large single crystal of PrOs$_4$Sb$_{12}$, such as specific heat, dc- and ac-magnetic susceptibility, were studied and exhibited two distinct anomalies in the specific heat, as well as an overall discontinuity of more than 1000 mJ\/K$^2$mol. The upper transition (at $T_{c1}$) showed a rounded shape, while the lower one, at $T_{c2}$, presented a very sharp anomaly. The magnetic susceptibility showed two peaks below $T_{c1}$, however, no signatures of the lower temperature transition were observed. It was discovered PrOs$_4$Sb$_{12}$ is extremely sensitive to grinding and this suppression of the upper transition was observed in both the specific heat and magnetic susceptibility of the powdered sample, showing a decrease in $\\Delta C\/T_{c}$ to 140 mJ\/K$^2$ mol. Existing data on grinding, polishing, and slicing single crystals indicates the existence of a length scale of about 100 $\\mu$, imparticular for its higher temperature superconducting phase."}
{"text":"\nWe performed high-frequency radio continuum observations at frequencies between 5 and 43 GHz of five massive young stellar objects (YSOs) using the Very Large Array (VLA) in its A configuration and MERLIN at 23 GHz. Our resolution was as high as 17 AU for the nearest source, allowing us to detect the two sources of our sample, S106-IR and S140-IRS1, as elongated perpendicular to their large scale bipolar outflows. The spectral indices found in our sample were between 0.2 and 0.8, which are generally consistent with ionized stellar winds. We modelled the sources as uniform, isothermal spherical winds, and found them to exhibit wind temperatures in the range of 2000 to 5000 K, far lower than the effective temperatures of main-sequence stars of similar luminosity. This discrepancy may be indicative of the clumpy nature of the winds."}
{"text":"\nBy taking into account the recent insights from neutrino oscillation experiments and direct mass bounds, we revisit the cosmological constraints on the radiative neutrino lifetime. We make use of the cosmic microwave background spectral data collected by the Far Infrared Absolute Spectrophotometer instrument on board of Cosmic Background Explorer to derive new bounds on the lifetime. Our results suggest a lower bound on the lifetime between a few x 10^19 s and 5 x 10^20 s, depending on the neutrino mass ordering and absolute mass scale. However, due to phase space limitations, the upper bound in terms of the effective magnetic moment mediating the decay is not better than ~ 10^-8 Bohr magnetons. We compare our findings with preexisting limits derived from laboratory or astrophysical arguments, and discuss possible improvements of our constraints with the help of recently available data about the diffuse infrared photon emission. We also underscore the importance of building on previous works in order to fully understand the physics of this phenomenon."}

{"text":"\nThrough our dynamic nuclear polarization experiment on a 40 mM solution of 4-amino-TEMPO in a 40:60 water\/glycerol mixture, we were able to rapidly polarize the nuclear spins via the exploitation of dipolar spin diffusion. We accomplished this by cooling the dipolar reservoir to a spin temperature of 15.5 micro-K through microwave irradiation for 800 s and equilibrating the two reservoirs. This led to a 50 % increase in the NMR signal intensity and a Zeeman spin temperature of 23 mK. Furthermore, radiating the sample for 1500 s was necessary for direct polarization transfer. We observed that cooling of the dipolar reservoir occurs through the magnetic field gradient around the paramagnetic impurity and is rapidly communicated to the bulk dipolar system, enabling polarization to be transferred more quickly than through Zeeman spin diffusion."}
{"text":"\nThis article investigates the evolution of modularity and robustness in complex, artificial metabolic networks. Such networks encode an increasing amount of information about the environment while obtaining ubiquitous features of biological and engineering networks, such as scale-free edge distribution, small world property, and fault-tolerance. Using new, modularity-based tools, the study examines the effect of environmental unpredictability on the development of modularity in these networks, alongside the modularity observed in the yeast protein-protein interaction network. Researchers found that for evolved networks, synthetic lethal pairs consisted of redundant genes that were close together, while knockdown suppressor pairs were often found at a distance and spanned between modules. This article therefore supports the use of network modularity tools and genetic interaction data to study the role of modularity in the evolution and function of biological networks."}
{"text":"\nIn this paper, we assess the velocity anisotropy of dark matter in galaxy clusters through X-ray observations of two nearby, relaxed clusters. This would be an important discovery, as a fundamental difference between dark matter and baryonic matter would further our understanding of dark matter structures and the initialization of dark matter particles. We assume hydrostatic equilibrium and equalized dark matter and baryon temperatures in the outer cluster region, using non-parametric Monte Carlo methods, to measure the anisotropy beta_dm. Our results reveal that beta_dm is greater than the expected beta_gas value of 0, at a statistically significant confidence level of more than 3-\u03c3. This finding is in compliance with recent cosmological numerical N-body studies, signifying that local point-like interactions do not control the equilibration of dark matter particles."}
{"text":"\nThis research delves into incorporating brane-anti-brane inflation in a specific type IIB string theory configuration, with all features fully stabilized. Our focus settles on a D3-brane, signifying the inflaton $\\phi$, nested inside a warped conifold throat, equipped with supersymmetrically-strung D7-branes and an anti D3-brane on the tip of the conifold cone. Once a thorough examination of the moduli stabilization for different D7-brane insertions is established, attention is given to two specific examples: Ouyang and Kuperstein embeddings. Our goal is to evaluate whether the effects of moduli stabilization on the D3-brane, might be balanced with fine-tuning, to recreate the initial attraction of the anti D3-brane as the core of inflation. Unfortunetly, any cancellation pursuaded by fine-tuning is only applicable to very limited $\\phi$ intervals, near an inflection point, and not universally. For that reason, the inflaton is usually subject to a steep, non-slow-roll potential as it moves. We continue by investigating the inflationary power of this potential."}
{"text":"This study unearths a link between the character of interband transitions at specific k-spaces, orbital magnetic moments, and Berry curvatures from inversion symmetry breaking. To demonstrate the general principle of this discovery, an example of graphene is presented, showcasing the optical selection rule contrast at different valleys when inversion symmetry is broken. Following that, applications in valley optoelectronics are discussed, pertaining to the conversion of light polarization information and electronic information. The findings of this article offer a potential approach to measure orbital magnetization and intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity in ferromagnetic systems."}
{"text":"This review looks at the elastic theory of one- and two-dimensional continua and how it can be used to analyze bio- and nano-structures. The article describes the curve and surface theory which can be used to model low-dimensional continua through the Cartan moving frame method. It then discusses the application of the theory to Kirchhoff rod, Helfrich rod, bending-soften rod, fluid membrane, and solid shell models. Regarding bio-structures, the article addresses the kink stability of short DNA rings, the behavior of lipid and cell membranes, as well as their mechanical stability. Finally, the article explains how the theory can be applied to graphene and carbon nanotubes, using the revised Lenosky lattice model and its continuum form up to second order terms of curvatures and strains. This approach allows for a thorough analysis of the mechanical properties of carbon nanotubes, and for the avoidance of the controversial notions of Young's modulus and thickness of graphene and single-walled carbon nanotubes."}
{"text":"\nWe examine the infrared (IR) spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of 600 galaxies at a redshift of approximately 0.7 in the extended Chandra Deep Field South, covering a wavelength range of 10-100 microns. Our aim is to determine the average IR SED shape of two different subsets: the brightest 25% of z~0.7 galaxies detected at 24micron, and the remaining 75% of individually-detected galaxies. Through stacking of the Spitzer 24, 70 and 160 micron images, we have placed interesting constraints on the average SEDs of these two groups. Our investigations reveal that the average IR SED of star-forming galaxies at z~0.7 is consistent with the range of z~0 templates. We find no correlation between dust obscuration and redshift when compared to stellar luminosity and star formation rate. However, when accounting for a star formation rate of 10 solar masses per year, the dust temperature of star-forming galaxies at a given IR luminosity appears to be lower at z~0.7 than today. We postulate that this could be due to a higher proportion of undisturbed galaxies at z~0.7 that host widespread star formation with lower dust temperatures. We discuss the implications of our findings and make recommendations for what IR SEDs are appropriate for modeling intermediate redshift galaxies with different levels of star formation."}
{"text":"\nAnalysis of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 5 has allowed us to investigate the features, structure and substructure of the stellar halo of the Milky Way. We applied oblate and triaxial broken power-law models to the data and determined a `best-fit' oblateness of the stellar halo between 0.5 and 0.8 and a halo stellar mass between 1 and 40kpc of (3.7+\/-1.2)x10^8 M_sun. The density of the halo profile appears to follow a r^{-3} law, though the slope is possibly shallower inside 20kpc and steeper outside. An overall evaluation of the data revealed substructure that could not be fit by any smooth, parameterized model, with the fractional RMS deviation from any smooth halo model being >~40%. In order to explain the properties of the Milky Way's halo, we compared our analysis to simulations of galactic stellar halos which are entirely due to the accretion of satellite galaxies from a cosmological context. While the qualities of the simulated halos varied, their similarities to the Milky Way's halo strongly suggest that a significant fraction of the Milky Way's stellar halo may have been accumulated from dissolved satellite galaxies."}
{"text":"\nThe lack of ongoing star formation in many luminous elliptical galaxies is explored in this paper by examining the stability of their circum-nuclear (CN) gas disks. When embedded in the potentials of both the stellar bulge and the central massive black hole, we found that CN disks in high-mass galaxies are generally more stable than those in lower-mass galaxies. This is because higher mass galaxies tend to have more massive black holes and a more concentrated stellar density profile. However, a cored stellar density profile, more common in galaxies of total stellar mass greater than 10^11 Msun, leads to more unstable CN disks. The more massive black holes in higher mass galaxies act to offset the destabilizing effects of the cored stellar density profile and may explain the reason why less luminous elliptical galaxies more frequently display star formation."}
{"text":"\nThrough constrained simulations, this study examines the evolution of the phase-space density profile in dark matter halos. Quiescent phases of slow accretion and sporadic major mergers reveal that the phase-space density follows a Taylor & Navarro power law which is remarkably stable over time (r^{-beta}, where beta ~ 1.9). Changes in the phase-space density is attributed to the effective mass surface density (\u03a3_s) within the halo radius (Rs) remains constant, leading to Qs ~ Rs^-5\/2 and Q(r) ~ Sigma_s^-1\/2 Rs^-5\/2 (r\/ Rs)^-beta. Violent phases of major mergers drive Rs to increase and Qs to decrease discontinuously while keeping Qs Rs^5\/2 = constant. In the quiescent phases, the virial equilibrium of DM halos dictate that a given halo evolves along a sequence of NFW profiles with a constant energy per unit volume (i.e., pressure) within the limits of Rs.\n"}
{"text":"This paper examines the effective, deformation-induced interactions between two colloidal particles captured at a fluid interface in the context of small deformations. Our findings show that the common practice of assuming the actual interface configuration of particles to be the linear superposition of deformations does not yield an accurate result. We demonstrate how the leading term of this interaction can be calculated for large interparticle separation when beyond the previously-mentioned superposition approximation. To form a more realistic picture, we consider the case in which electrostatic fields generated by charged colloidal particles induce interface deformations. Through mechanical isolation, i.e. if the overall force of the colloidal particles and the interface vanishes, we discover that the capillary-induced interaction is in fact attractive. Further, if the surface charges on the colloids are adequately small and the interparticle separation is great, then the effective interaction will not overpower the electrostatic repulsion between the colloidal particles."}

To gain a better evaluation, complexity analysis and multiple examples are used in order to develop a scheme to efficiently decide which method to use, depending on the properties of the matrix.

Using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 5, and then confirming our findings with deeper images from the Calar Alto Observatory, the two clusters, known as Koposov 1 and Koposov 2, were located between 40-50 kpc away. Both of the clusters exhibited an old stellar population and a low luminosity of $M_V \\sim -1$ mag. The size was also quite small, estimated to be only 3 pc, which is well below the expected tidal limit of 10 pc. Together with AM 4, Palomar 1 and Whiting 1, Koposov 1 and 2 are the faintest globular clusters in outer halo of the Milky Way. Koposov 2 is the dimmest of the group. It may be associated to the distant branch of the Sagittarius stream. With a half-mass relaxation time of only 70 and 55 million years respectively, Koposov 1 and 2 have undergone serious mass segregation. Additionally, their evaporation time is estimated to be 0.1 Hubble times, which suggests an initial population of much bigger globular clusters. Summarily, there is still much more to learn about the structural properties of globular clusters in the Milky Way halo."}
{"text":"  This article introduces a 3-stranded quantum algorithm for computing the value of the Jones polynomial of a 3-stranded knot or link at all points of a unit circle in the complex plane. The first algorithm, called the classical 3-stranded braid (3-SB) algorithm, is a classical deterministic algorithm with time complexity O(L). The second, the quantum 3-SB algorithm, is a quantum algorithm that has an execution time complexity of O(nL), where n is the ceiling function of (ln(4\/\\epsilon_{2}))\/(2(\\epsilon_{2})^2), and calculates an estimate of the Jones polynomial at $exp(i\\phi))$ within a precision of $\\epsilon_{1}$ with a probability of success bounded below by $1-\\epsilon_{2}%. In addition, the compilation time complexity, i.e., an asymptotic measure of the time to assemble the hardware for the algorithm, is O(L)."}
{"text":"\nIn this paper, we explore a modification of a previously proposed model developed by Jackson and Wolinsky. This model seeks to address the communication of information and the allocation of goods across socioeconomic networks. Our model includes a utility function for each node in which the contributions from all accessible nodes are weighted by a parameter - $\\delta$ - which decreases in value with distance. We experiment with different growth mechanisms for the nodes in the network, and the outcome suggests that the underlying structure of the network can be changed from a power-law to an exponential degree distribution (via a regime characterized by shorter path length, lower degree assortativity and higher central point dominance), depending on the value assigned to $\\delta$. Furthermore, we compare different network structures in terms of the average utility they afford, and we see that power-law networks tend to provide higher utility than Poisson random networks. Consequently, this may explain why similar scale-free networks often occur in the real world."}
{"text":"\nThis paper examines the Cosmological Slingshot scenario, a recently proposed mechanism for the generation of primordial cosmological perturbations. We derive a general expression for the Slingshot power spectrum, which accounts for a blue preexisting residual contribution at larger scales. By calculating the CMB temperature and polarization spectra associated with the Slingshot, we demonstrate that it accurately matches standard WMAP 3-year best-fit results. Further, when the blue residual spectrum is much greater than the largest WMAP scale observed, fixing the amplitude and spectral index at the pivot scale of 10^-3h*Mpc^-1, the Slingshot primordial spectrum is a good fit for the data. We also determine that any distinctive Slingshot signatures in the CMB power spectra are only discernible at very low multipoles and would be hard to detect due to the large cosmic variance error in those areas."}
{"text":"\nUsing Chandra X-ray observations of 42 of the most massive, X-ray luminous, and dynamically relaxed galaxy clusters over a redshift range of 0.05 to 1.1, we have determined constraints on the mean matter density, Omega_m, dark energy density, Omega_de, and the dark energy equation of state parameter, w. Using the 6 lowest redshift clusters, for which the dark energy has a minimal influence, we measure Omega_m to be 0.28 with a 68% confidence interval when applying standard priors on the Hubble Constant, H_0, and the mean baryon density, Omega_bh^2. Furthermore, by analyzing the entire sample for a non-flat LCDM model we detect the effects of dark energy at a very high confidence level. In addition, our fgas data has a weighted mean statistical scatter of just 5%, and combining our results with other studies of CMB and SNIa allows us to remove prior assumptions of Omega_bh and H_0, producing more specific results of Omega_m and w that support the cosmological constant paradigm. This study is remarkable in its precision and accuracy and lays the foundation for future dark energy investigations."}
{"text":" \nIn this article, we demonstrate that the form of the extrapolation formulae used in mixed action theories with chirally symmetric valence fermions is universal up to the next-to-leading order. Our conclusion relies on the fact that the valence quarks are chirally-symmetric. We then construct a prescription to determine the extrapolation formulae for a range of hadronic correlation functions which are computed through partially quenched chiral perturbation theory at the one-loop level. We apply this prescription to the nucleon twist--2 matrix elements and the neutron EDM, both of which are theta-dependent observables. Our results indicate that the numerical values of the physical coefficients within these mixed action chiral Lagrangians will have the same values across all sea quark methods in the same universal classification as QCD, with slight corrections related to the lattice spacing."}
{"text":"\nWe explore the accepted string theory notion that curved backgrounds and flat space theory with a tachyon-like potential are dual to each other. This duality can be demonstrated at the level of N-point correlation functions on the sphere topology and the equal coupling of tree-level string amplitudes in the Euclidean 2D black hole (x-time) to correlation functions in a non-linear sigma-model in flat space but with a tachyon wall potential and linear dilaton. Furthermore, the dual CFT corresponds to quantum gravity coupled to C<1 matter (x time), where the tachyon-like potential is seen as an n=2 momentum mode perturbation and sine-Liouville operator as an n=1 vortex sector. In order to show how the sine-Liouville interaction arises, twisting of the marginal deformation is carried out. We then display the formula found and proven by S. Ribault and J. Teschner to connect the correlation functions of Wess-Zumino-Witten theory to Liouville theory. This duality that is discussed may be viewed as a free field realization of this formula."}
{"text":"We explored the spin Hall conductance of a two-dimensional electron gas in a perpendicular magnetic field through a microscopic theoretical analysis of the conserved spin current [Phys. Rev. Lett.  \\textbf{96}, 076604 (2006)]. The electric field-induced spin Hall conductance $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}^{s}$ was split into two parts: an orthodox component $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}^{s0}$ and an additional spin-torque dipole correction $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}^{s\\tau}$. Spin-orbit coupling counteracted Zeeman splitting to create degeneracies between different Landau levels at different lengths of the magnetic field, which led to enhancements in both $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}^{s0}$ and $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}^{s\\tau}$ when such degeneracies occurred at the Fermi level. Overall, the total spin Hall current was strengthened, with $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}^{s\\tau}$ being much bigger than $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}^{s0}$ at the resonances."}
{"text":"\nThis work introduces a procedure for modelling strong gravitational lensing of galaxy clusters with a set of parametric methods, alongside the use of Bayesian evidence to measure the reliability of the models obtained. To demonstrate the efficacy of the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler ('Bayesys') employed, clusters composed of a cluster-scale halo, and several galaxy-scale subhalos were simulated and three light beams were ray-traced through each model to generate multiple images. Results of doing so showed that for imaging data of quality akin to data collected by the Hubble Space Telescope, mass of the Einstein radius can be recovered ~1-5% accurately, depending on the lensing configuration. Conversely, mass of the galaxies was correlated with the cluster mass in absence of multiple images in the centre, meaning accuracy of the recovered mass was limited (20%). Lastly, the Bayesian evidence was applied to models in order to rank them, conferring the ability of lensing to measure mass profile in the internal region of galaxy clusters. This was tested via Lenstool software package, which is publicly accessible, making this method attainable by anyone."}
{"text":"This article investigates a gauge theory involving massive and massless neutrinos on unbalanced seesaws. By preserving a SU(2)_L x U(1)_Y gauge symmetry while introducing an additional p+q Majorana neutrinos, an overall neutrino mass matrix M can be generated. Considering p>q, this leaves (p-q) massless left-handed Majorana neutrinos as an exact consequence of the model, independent of the standard Type-I seesaw relation. As a result, the heavy and light Majorana neutrino masses are fairly matched, and the minimal seesaw model offers an example with one massless neutrino on the unbalanced seesaw."}
{"text":"\nWe present a new definition of cuspidality for representations of $\\GL_n$ over discrete valuation rings of a non-Archimedean local field $F$. With this, we connect strongly cuspidal representations of $\\GL_n(F)$ with a definition for cuspidal representations of finite general linear groups. In the function field case, we also demonstrate how the representations of $\\GL_n(\\Oh_k)$ for $k\\geq 2$ and all $n$ are linked to the representations of the groups $G_\\lambda$. Furthermore, we provide a functional equation for zeta functions for those representations that are not induced from those of $G_\\lambda$. Lastly, we establish that all the cuspidal representations for $\\GL_4(\\Oh_2)$ have been constructed, not all of which are strongly cuspidal."}
{"text":"\nThis article examines the calculation of pair correlation functions in a nematic phase for a model of spherical particles with a long-range anisotropic interaction, utilizing the mean spherical approximation (MSA) and the Percus-Yevick (PY) integral equation theories. The results from the MSA theory are compared to those found by Holovko and Sokolovska (J. Mol. Liq. $\\bf 82$, 161(1999)), and a free-energy functional that considers both the symmetry conserving and symmetry broken parts of the direct pair correlation is utilized to analyze the properties of the nematic structure. Additionally, an alternate free-energy functional that only considers the principal order parameter of the ordered phase is explored. The isotropic-nematic transition is determined using the grand thermodynamic potential, while the PY theory is found to possess nematic phase pair correlation functional harmonic coefficients with all applicable features. Investigation reveals that both the MSA and PY theories posses long-range tail correlation of the director transverse fluctuations within the nematic phase."}
{"text":"Using the Far-Infrared Surveyor (FIS) aboard the AKARI satellite, far-infrared images of the nearby Sb galaxy, NGC2841 and Sc galaxy, NGC2976, have been obtained at respective wavelengths of 65, 90, 140, and 160 um. The images reveal a notable difference in the dust temperature between the two galaxies, as seen in NGC2841's cold (21 K) ring in contrast to NGC2976's warm (30 K) ring, which may be attributed to the difference in the origin of the ring structure for the respective Hubble types. Also, a warm dust component has been detected in the central region of NGC2841, signifying the heating from its Low-Ionization Nuclear Emission-line Region nucleus, while an extended dust component along the minor axis of NGC2976 reveals an asymmetrical distribution, which may be related to the HI bridge in the M81\/M82 group to which it belongs. The spectral energy distribution of the two galaxies was compared, showing NGC2841's greater spatial variability."}
{"text":"\n\nThis study describes the successful in-orbit focal adjustment of the AKARI telescope, with lightweight Silicon Carbide mirrors cooled to 9 K in the laboratory showing expected diffraction-limited imaging performance at 6.2 um. After the cryostat aperture lid was released in the orbit on the 4th day, images of the star were significantly blurred and had to be adjusted by twice shifting the secondary mirror. Model and data analyses were used to guide the adjustment. The adjusted focus of the AKARI telescope was eventually diffraction-limited at 7.3 um, slightly lower than predicted from laboratory measurements."}
{"text":"\nA comprehensive analysis of the initial UKIDSS Deep eXtragalactic Survey (DXS) data of the ELAIS-N1 field revealed candidate galaxy over-densities at z~1 within an area of one square degree. By utilizing I-K, J-K, and K-3.6um colour indices the five structures were further spectroscopically observed at the Gemini\/GMOS and confirmed to be real over-densities having up to nineteen members each. Strikingly, they are located in a very precise redshift range (z=0.89+\/-0.01), but spread across a 30Mpc distance on the sky. What is more, a sixth over-density was identified at z=1.09. Comparisons with a mock cluster catalog from N-body simulations indicate that the supercluster discovered in the ELAIS-N1 Field has similar characteristics to the Shapley and Hercules superclusters at lower redshifts."}
{"text":"\nThis study explores the early evolution of such isolated, dark matter-free dwarf galaxies and the effects of feedback to their star formation. Our 2-D chemodynamical models investigate how various feedback parameters influence the development of these dwarf galaxies and how the chemical evolution is impacted. It was found that star formation progressed for more than 300 Myr, indicating that dwarf galaxies without large dark matter halos can survive even without the support of a dark matter halo. Furthermore, the chemical properties of the modelled galaxies was found to be comparable to that of dSphs of the Local Group, while models with increased dark matter halos yielded similar results. Thus, our research suggests that the distribution of gas is more important than the potential of the dark matter halo in determining the overall behaviour of dSph-sized dwarf galaxies. This provides insight into the origin and evolution of tidal dwarf galaxies, offering further understanding of their place in the Local Universe."}
{"text":"\nThis study focuses on a survey of 22 nearby young stars, primarily from the Tucana and Beta Pictoris moving groups apart from the slightly older HIP 71395. Its purpose was to detect substellar companions and giant extrasolar planets down to the mass of Jupiter. An observation method was utilized in the L-band with adaptive optics technology provided by NAOS-CONICA (NACO) at the VLT to survey the stars. This specific technique is well suited for detecting close companions around young stars and achieves some of the greatest sensitivities currently available in order to detect companions cooler than 1000K. Results showed the companion of 51 Eri, GJ 3305, to be a close binary on an eccentric orbit. Though, no other substellar companions were found. Nevertheless, the method allowed for detection of companions down to a few Jupiter masses at distances of 5 astronomical units. This survey was used to rule out the presence of a planet larger than 1 M_Jup at a distance greater than 5 AU from AU Mic. Furthermore, its yields can be used to set boundaries on the frequency distribution and maximum orbital distance of giant exoplanets. For instance, it is possible to reject, with 90% confidence, a radial distribution power law index of 0.2 corresponding with a maximum orbital radius larger than 30 AU."}
{"text":"\nThis article examines two forms of algorithmic reduction, illustrated in the interactive Turing reduction and the associated Gentzen-style axiomatization. The article reveals that the second form of reduction, which is not allowed to reuse the antecedent, can be derived by deleting the contraction rule from the first form of reduction. Additionally, three versions of Turing interactive reduction are presented, which demonstrate distinct behaviours but are logically indistinguishable. Furthermore, a series of new finite and bounded versions of recurrence and reduction operations are presented informally. Finally, an online source for computability logic is provided."}
{"text":"\nIn this paper, the effect of Zeeman spin splitting and a spatially inhomogeneous Rashba interaction on the transmission of ballistic quantum wires is studied. We find that when the external magnetic field is perpendicular to the Rashba field, the spins of the asymptotic wavefunctions do not form eigenstates of the Rashba Hamiltonian and this coupling between spins gives rise to sudden changes of the transmission probability when the Fermi energy is swept through the gap. Additionally, in wires with localized Rashba interaction, transmission zeros (antiresonances) are ubiquitous when Fermi energy is slightly increased. We use a minimal tight-binding model to obtain analytical transmission lineshapes of the Fano antiresonance type. Furthermore, realistic quantum wires where the energy subbands are coupled via the Rashba intersubband coupling term are considered and its effect on the transmission zeros is analyzed."}
{"text":"This paper presents a new template family for identifying gravitational waves produced by comparable-mass black hole binaries. The templates, based upon re-expressing the derivative of the binding energy and gravitational wave flux functions using shifted Chebyshev polynomials, offer improvements in both the speed and accuracy of detecting the inspiral of two comparable-mass black hole binaries. As shifted Chebyshev polynomials have the fastest convergence of any orthogonal polynomial, they are better suited for signal detection than the traditional post-Newtonian expansions. The new templates are compared to a fiducially exact waveform, one constructed via a hybrid approach combining test-mass results with mass-dependent parts of post-Newtonian expansions for the binding energy and flux functions. The results show that these new Chebyshev templates offer significant improvements with respect to Signal-to-Noise ratios, fitting factors, the position of the Last Stable Orbit, and more."}
{"text":"This article studies the effect of electron interaction on the statistics of conductance oscillations in open quantum dots when the temperature is greater than the mean level spacing $\\Delta$. Self-consistent calculations are used, with results that agree quantitatively with previous observations. It is found that electron interaction leads to a significant smearing of the conductance oscillations, similar to that of temperature or inelastic scattering. However, for temperatures above $\\Delta$ the effect of electron interaction becomes much weaker. This challenges the conventional explanation for the coherence time saturation at low temperatures, which is based on the assumption that electron interactions are not present."}
{"text":"This investigation dives into the relations of magnification between a Kerr black hole with mass parameter m and angular momentum parameter a and the corresponding two images in the weak field limit. The magnification sums and the centroid were analysed up to the post-Newtonian order, discovering a post-Newtonian correction of the total absolute magnification and centroid proportional to a\/m. Therefore, these new observables should be able to measure a\/m with gravitational lensing, potentially giving a resolution capability to detect a\/m >1 showing a naked singularity which would be a test for the Cosmic Censorship conjecture. The research used the correlation between a Kerr lens and a Schwarzschild lens at post-Newtonian order, providing a physical basis for the explanation of this degeneracy."}
{"text":"\nThis research presents the results of a broad band X-ray spectral investigation of Mkr 841, a bright Seyfert 1 galaxy exhibiting strong soft X-ray emission and a variable K$\\alpha$ iron line. Utilizing data obtained over three different periods at XMM to generate a total cumulated exposure time of $\\sim$108 ks, we assess two models, a relativistically blurred photoionized reflection (\\r model) and a relativistically smeared ionized absorption (\\a model), for the soft excess. The continuum is modelled with a cut-off power law, and a neutral reflection is additionally added. Our analyses demonstrate the unpredictable spectral and temporal activities of the soft excess and iron line, with the 0.5-3 keV flux dropping by a factor of three from 2001 to 2005. Both \\r and \\a fit the soft excess adequately while considering BeppoSAX data up to 200 keV. Both models appear to be in keeping with distant reflection featuring a constant narrow component, though they depart in the presence of a broad line component exclusive to \\r. Moreover, this study indicates the intermittent existence of relativistically redshifted narrow iron lines."}
{"text":"This article examines the asymptotic characteristics of large Deformed Wigner matrices $M_N=W_N\/\\sqrt{N}+A_N$. $W_N$ is a Hermitian (respectively, symmetric) matrix with entries that follow a symmetric law, while $A_N$ is deterministic Hermitian (respectively, symmetric) with almost all eigenvalues equal to zero. We determine that as soon as the first largest or last smallest eigenvalues of $A_N$ are sufficiently large, the corresponding eigenvalues of $M_N$ almost surely escape the limiting semicircle support as $N$ increases. Furthermore, these limits are universal in the sense that the variance of the entries of $W_N$ is the only factor involved. Conversely, when $A_N$ is diagonal with a single large non-zero eigenvalue, we prove that the fluctuations of the largest eigenvalue are not universal, and are determined by the particular distribution of the entries of $W_N$."}
{"text":"\nThis article presents a modification of the Navier-Stokes equations in order to incorporate mass diffusion in the flow at hypersonic velocities. Results from this modified model are compared with those of the model used by Greenshields & Reese (2007), which included a somewhat arbitrary choice of coefficients, as well as potential instabilities. The new model's modifications add a diffusion term to the mass conservation equation, meaning efficient and stable results are now possible with boundary conditions that are simpler to satisfy than traditional extended hydrodynamics models. The quality of the altered model's predictions for shock waves in argon in the Mach 1.0-12.0 range are similar to those of the extended hydrodynamics models that include the Burnett equations. In light of these results and the simplicity of implementation, further research of the model is recommended."}
{"text":"\nWe explore the wide array of spin-dependent, non-equilibrium transport phenomena in systems that feature a normal region coupled to two superconductors where exchange fields are generated by their proximity to thin ferromagnetic layers. By calculating the quasiparticle distribution functions in the normal region, we observe that they possess spin-dependence, as well as being highly sensitive to the angle between the exchange fields of the two superconductors. We also examine the effect of inelastic collisions on these properties. Our results show that the current that flows through the system is strongly affected by the relative angle between exchange fields, resulting in an exceedingly high value of magnetoresistance. Furthermore, the current is completely spin-polarized within a large range of bias voltages, even in the quasi-equilibrium situation. In the non-equilibrium limit, we use an ``effective`` temperature to characterize the distributions and find that it is spin-dependent, though quite susceptible to inelastic collisions. Lastly, by connecting the normal region to an extra superconducting electrode, we establish that it is possible to produce spin-polarized current sources of either spin species, depending on the applied bias voltages."}
{"text":"\nThis article examines the simulation of high-dimensional systems that interact with one another, employing qubits as our main tool. We study a variety of methods of creating effective many-body interactions, including higher-order processes (commutator method), unitary conjugation, graph state encoding, and teleportation based approaches. We evaluate and compare the time taken for each of these methods, and investigate how noise can affect the simulation. We explore two generic noise models: timing errors in pairwise interactions, and noisy pairwise interactions described by Master equations of the Lindblad form. We evaluate the impact of noise on the different simulation methods, and suggest a way to combat noise by combining entanglement purification with a teleportation-based protocol."}
{"text":"This article presents a framework for examining how entities change over time based on their respective contexts. We refer to this approach as Context-driven Actualization of Potential (CAP). This framework facilitates an understanding of the differences in how state-changes occur in different disciplines. For instance, our analysis posits that the dynamical evolution of quantum entities, as described by the Schrodinger equation, is not distinct from the changes by measurement (or, the 'collapse'), but merely a limiting case. Additionally, our framework offers insights into concepts such as selection and fitness, demonstrating how exceptional Darwinian evolution is as a means of state-change. Lastly, it reveals the connections between culture, and the creative processes that embody it, and Darwinian principles."}
{"text":"This article investigates the output stream of a binding neuron which is subjected to feedback from its own output. Drawing from the Hodgkin-Huxley-type point neuron and the leaky integrate-and-fire model, the memory of the binding neuron is limited for a certain period which differs from the decaying postsynaptic potential of the two models. This allows for the creation of recurrent networks for numerical modeling. Coldly, this paper focuses on the output stream of a single binding neuron which is externally provided with a Poissonian stream. In particular, a numerical approach is used to study the stochastic output process for the neuron at different thresholds and feedback is taken into consideration. Comparisons will be drawn between the binding neuron with and without feedback and the leaky integrator. The results suggest that the simplest form of networking can have major influence on the spiking statistics, leading to information condensation on the single-neuron level."}
{"text":"\nIn this paper, we assess the isotropy of the Hubble diagram at small and large redshifts. For redshifts less than 0.2, we use publicly available supernovae (SNe) Ia data to calculate the deceleration parameter q_0 and SN calibrations from opposite hemispheres. We present evidence that the cosmological expansion appears to be anisotropic at these redshifts, leading us to conclude that there is an asymmetry between the equatorial North and South hemispheres. This discrepancy appears to be correlated with the LambdaCDM model for all the available SNe Ia data, implying the potential for systematic errors in the observation, analysis and data reduction. On the other hand, we are unable to determine the accelerated expansion of the Universe with any statistical significance."}

After centering and rescaling properly, it is proven that this random variable obeys the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) with a Gaussian limit, whose parameters are identified. The article gives a full description of the scaling parameter; namely, it is observed that an extra term arises for this parameter should the 4$^{\\textrm{th}}$ moment of the $X_{ij}$'s differ from the 4$^{\\textrm{th}}$ moment of a Gaussian random variable. This CLT has applications in wireless communication."}
{"text":"\nWe demonstrate that the Kullback-Leibler distance is a viable way\nto measure the uncertainty of correlations discovered in a limited amount of data.

{"text":"\n\nA new analysis of the Renormalization Group (RG) improved cosmologies based on Quantum Einstein Gravity (QEG) with realistic parameters reveals that the scale dependence of the gravitational parameters, namely the cosmological constant, results in an entropy production in the matter system. It is proposed that the universe began with no entropy and that the radiation entropy observed today is derived from the coarse graining of the quantum gravity sector due to the expansion of the Universe. The newly constructed RG improved field equations further have solutions that support a power law inflation scenario immediately after the initial singularity which is controlled by the cosmological constant and ends when the running of the vacuum energy reduces to the matter energy density."}
{"text":"\nResearch on spin-dependent electronic behavior in small-scale materials has not received the same attention as the investigation of the electron charge-related features. However, in recent times, more and more electron spin-connected experiments have been conducted, giving insight into potential new pathways in information processing and transmission. To this purpose, a theoretical analysis of the charges with spin half and the resonant tunneling characteristics of a GaAs-Ga1-x AlxAs double-barrier heterostructure under an applied stress was conducted. The approach adopted the Keldysh diagrammatic techniques for out-of-equilibrium processes and a one-band tight-binding Hamiltonian model. Results were then compared to existing studies into the same phenomenon."}
{"text":"\nA Regge model with absorption effects is used to analyze the world data on both positive and negative charged-pion photoproduction in photon energies from 3 to 8 GeV. In this region, resonance effects are deemed to be insignificant, thereby enabling the compilation of information on differential cross sections and single polarization observables with -t \\leq 2 GeV^2. Such an generated model amplitude is then used to forecast the observables for photon energies beneath 3 GeV, where differences between the predictions and available data are investigated for potential resonance fingerprints. In particular, the polarized photon asymmetry indicates promising resonance outlines near 2 GeV, whereas the analysis of recently acquired data from JLab on negative pion photoproduction likewise signals to resonance formations in a similar energy range."}
{"text":"\nAnalysis of the pressure induced insulator to metal transition (IMT) in pure LaMnO$_3$ has been conducted to understand the role of the orbitals degrees of freedom on the electronic structure of the stoichiometric material. To include the strong correlations caused by electron-electron interactions, the model Hamiltonian for the Mn $e_g$ orbitals incorporates the Coulomb repulsion $U$, hopping $t$, and its dependence with pressure. To account for this, O-Mn distance ($d$) dependence of $t$ is introduced and the experimental pressure-$d$ relation is utilized. Results have backed the previous ab-initio calculations that Coulomb energy is crucial and widens the orbital polarization of the compound. IMT has been found to take place at 32 GPa and room temperature, which is higher than the Neel temperature (145K) and lower than the Jahn-Teller transition temperature (780K)."}
{"text":"\nThis work explores the effects of excluded volume terms that form minor structural cooperativity within a coarse-grained variational model, in order to predict the folding rates of two-state folding proteins. It was found that cooperative folding routes tend to have higher free energy barriers, along with sharper folded\/unfolded region interfaces, which are strongly related to native topology. In addition, increasing nucleus rigidity affected the transition state composition non-uniformly, but the calculated prefactors k0 maintained roughly the same value. Upon using the obtained folding rate data and a monomer relaxation time of 30ns, the average 1\/k0 value was found to be 4us. This model can be used to further study the relationship between rate and stability, folding in solvents of differing viscosity and the idea of downhill folding."}
{"text":"This article discusses the development of diagnostic tools for oceanographic data on three-dimensional (3D) unstructured meshes. We show that these tools can be constructed with relative ease using open source programming languages such as Python and packages like NumPy, SciPy, VTK and MayaVi. We demonstrate this with the example of flux of vector fields through isosurfaces, using flow data from an unstructured mesh finite element ocean code. These general tools can be applied to the output from any unstructured grid ocean code and are an essential component in the analysis of such data."}
{"text":"\nWe present Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) results of BL Lac objects taken from the RGB sample. By using the Doppler factor of the Very Long Array (VLA) or Multi-Element Radio Linked Interferometer (MERLIN) core and total 408MHz luminosity, we calculated the intrinsic (comoving) synchrotron peak frequency of 170 BL Lac sources. We based our assumptions on a Lorentz factor of 5 and estimated the viewing angles of the jets accordingly. The VLBI images of the seven sources were supportive of the core-jet structure. Through the use of archive data, we determined the proper motions for three sources and observed an increase in speed when the components moved away from the core. Our sample confirms the Doppler factor of LBLs to be larger than IBLs and HBLs. We found an anti-correlation between the 408MHz luminosity and intrinsic synchrotron peak frequency, although the accompanying scatter was high. Additionally, a positive correlation was observed between the viewing angle and intrinsic synchrotron peak frequency, which suggests that these two values are linked in our sample. Finally, the BL Lacs show a consistent range of viewing angles, with LBLs having a lower value than IBLs and HBLs, while IBLs and HBLs have comparable angles."}
{"text":"\nWe conducted an Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) study of approx. 10 \u03bcm thick stacks of DMPC (1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phoshatidylcholine) that were placed on silicon wafers. These multi-lamellar stacks could stay stable in excess water or solution for measurement. Force curves were employed to determine the compressional modulus B and the rupture force F_r of the bilayers in the gel (ripple), fluid phases, and near the main transition. AFM showed its viability to measure the modulus of the stacked membrane systems and find results that correspond to those in the literature. At the highest layer of the Pbeta' (ripple) phase, we observed distinct ripples. As the temperature neared the main phase transition point (24\u00b0C) into the Lalpha fluid phase, the ripple period Lambda_r got bigger. 2Lambda_r ripples were also seen, and Lambda_r augmented with increasing osmotic pressure, caused by polyethylene glycol (PEG) of various concentrations."}
{"text":"\nUsing a series of high resolution N-body simulations, we explore the clustering, abundance, and mass assembly history of dark matter halos at high redshift. We discover that the accuracy of the analytical shape that fits the halo abundance is highly dependent on the definition of halo mass, and these low concentration, massive halos can vary by up to a factor of two in mass. Merger activity and mass accretion are seen to be frequent among these massive halos, which we compare to the Press-Schechter formalism. Then, we analyze how the increased levels of star formation and black hole accretion from large mergers can influence the distribution of ionizing photons during reionization, introducing a large scatter in photon production from halos of a given mass. This can therefore result in greater variability in sizes of ionized bubbles."}
{"text":"\nWe have conducted the initial investigation of the AGN fraction in high-redshift clusters of galaxies at a redshift of 0.6. Through spectroscopy of one cluster and archival data of three others, we detected 8 AGN with X-ray luminosity L_{X,H} > 10^43 ergs\/s. This is in stark contrast to the 1 AGN of the same luminosity we identified in eight low-redshift clusters with an average redshift of 0.2. The three high-redshift datasets are almost sensitive to X-ray luminosity of ~10^42 ergs\/s, seven AGN with this luminosity being identified. Using membership estimates, we measured the AGN fraction as f_A(L_X>10^42;M_R<-20) = 0.028 (+0.019\/-0.012) and f_A(L_X>10^43;M_R<-20) = 0.020 (+0.012\/-0.008). These measurements are remarkable as they are at least twenty times greater than AGN fractions found in low-redshift clusters. This astonishing increase implies a greater amount of space density evolution of hard X-ray luminosity function over this redshift range than previously observed. Even potential systematic errors would enhance the magnitude of our results, hinting towards the presence of an AGN Butcher-Oemler effect."}
{"text":"\nThe outcomes of N-body\/smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations and theoretical calculations indicate that thermostatic processes occurring at a temperature of T_F ~ 10^4 K play a significant role in the physical properties of small galaxies. Specifically, the gas pressure support relative to the angular momentum support is greatest in the least massive galaxies, making them generally more spherical in shape, richer in gas, and less successful in terms of star formation. We argue that dwarf galaxies with rotational velocities less than 40 km\/s do not originate from thin discs, but rather from thick and puffier systems. Additionally, when these kinds of dwarfs are subsumed into bigger haloes, they will be more susceptible to losing gas or being transformed by tidal forces than larger spiral galaxies. Further, as a result of the temperature floor, gas pressure support becomes less dominant in larger haloes, making it more likely for standing massive galaxies to have thinner discs and efficacious star formation rates, in agreement with observations."}
{"text":"\nWe analyze the power of red sequence cluster finders on an array of galaxies from the Millennium Simulation (MS). We find that for low redshifts (z=0.4) the majority of clusters identified had a single halo with the remaining 10% questioning whether any single halo had credit for majority of the cluster's membership. Far with redshift (z=1), this increased to 22%, thus more challenging the red sequence cluster finder. This was mainly due to weaker red shift evolution of color and further confusion due to larger number of intermediate halos with bright red galaxies of magnitude similar to those in higher mass halos. We then developed a model that would describe a bimodal log-normal shaped mass selection function (p(M|\\Ngal,z)) which reproduced the real space distribution. We also investigated the effect on X-ray properties of optically selected clusters and suggest approaches to better improve the current mock catalogs being used."}
{"text":"\nThe question of whether any gaps in the electronic density of states (DOS) of high-Tc superconductors exist above the superconducting transition temperature, Tc, and what mechanism causes the formation of electron pairs, has been difficult to answer until now. This study, utilizing scanning tunnelling microscopy to measure the gap formation in Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+d samples with different Tc values (hole concentrations varying from 0.12 to 0.22), has revealed that at a wide range of doping from 0.16 to 0.22, pairing gaps of nanometric sizes nucleate above Tc. Upon lowering the temperature, the number and size of these regions increases, leading to their distribution in the superconducting state. Additionally, a relation of 2D\/kBTp = 8 has been found for the temperature, Tp, when pairing takes place locally in the samples. A variation in the DOS has been observed for very low doping (<0.14) indicating the presence of another phenomenon which may interfere with electron pairing. Overall, these findings may offer a resolution for recently reported fluctuations in superconducting response above Tc of copper oxide superconductors."}
{"text":"\nWe consider the growth of green and red clusters on graphs, where green areas expand to others and join, with no mutual competition. On the other hand, red is only invading when a green emerges; at that point, it is no longer able to increase its size and acts as red itself. The main question we ask is whether this process can occur in an infinite graph, such as the d-dimensional lattice, and if so, what properties should this system have. We demonstrate that, when the number of initially red vertices is non-zero and the number of initially white vertices is sufficiently low, the model is viable and the size of green clusters has an exponential tail. We also uncover a relationship between invasion and critical Bernoulli percolation."}
{"text":"\nThis study examines the long-term tidal evolution of planets with short-periods, particularly in cases where they have undetected companion planets. Our research suggests the eccentricity of short-period planets may remain non-zero for the lifetime of a system, given the companion's mass is at least a fraction of an Earth mass. We look at how the internal structure of a planet's interior can influence the timescale for which the companion's eccentricity can remain active. Additionally, we find that the orbital parameters of the undetected companion planet would be consistent with recent studies pointing to the formation of low-mass planets around hot Jupiters through the migration process. Such configurations may be the best targets to search for Earth-like planets, not to mention the fact that they could potentially house planets in their habitable zones."}
{"text":"\nThis research explores the relationship between distortion and delay when transmitting an analogue source across a fading channel using a buffer. Two extremes are taken into account: no delay and infinite delay. Evidence suggests that in the former case, a buffer delay can yield a significant power gain. The goal, therefore, is to observe the middle ground between the two. Utilizing the concept of 'effective capacity', a formula for this tradeoff is derived. With regard to the Single-Input-Single-Output case, an accurate upper bound for the distortion-delay curve is found, the expression for which approaches to the infinite delay lower bound as $\\mathcal{D}_\\infty \\exp(\\frac{C}{\\tau_n})$. Moreover, the distortion signal-to-noise ratio exponent of the multiple-input-multiple-output signal is also determined. Results from numerical simulations prove that even a small amount of delay can reduce the amount of power required for transmission significantly."}
{"text":"\nThis paper investigates the nature of the zero-temperature phase of the two-dimensional bimodal XY spin-glass model. We use the computational tool of the genetic embedded matching (GEM) heuristic to analyze properties such as the ground-state energy, phase diagrams of disorder strength and disorder concentration, and the excitation spectrum. Results from our analysis suggest that the system does not have extensive degeneracies or a multitude of thermodynamic pure states. Furthermore, we find evidence of spin-chirality decoupling at large length scales with two distinct stiffness exponents. All of our findings provide important insight into the zero-temperature behavior of this Edwards-Anderson spin-glass model with continuous-spin symmetry."}
{"text":"This article describes the use of conformational gel analysis and graphics in the detection of rotational isomers in peptides and proteins. The process involves extracting local molecular mechanics of rotational isomerization from a single representative global conformation and using this data to determine the populations of rotational isomers and the probability distribution of these populations. The article also introduces a novel application of the conformational gel analysis to the cobalt glycyl-leucine dipeptide as an example, and outlines how the process can be generalized to other amino acid side chains and peptides. Furthermore, the article highlights the potential importance of rotational isomers that are not identified by conventional structure determination methods, yet may play a critical role in structure and function. The conformational gel analysis and graphics thus provide an invaluable tool for delving into such small but meaningful details."}
{"text":"\nThis paper presents an algorithm for finding the number of rational points on the Jacobian variety of a generic ordinary hyperelliptic curve over a finite field of cardinality $q$, with time complexity of $O(n^{2+o(1)})$ and space complexity of $O(n^2)$, where $n = \\log(q)$. Moreover, this complexity estimate assumes the genus and the characteristic remain fixed. Our algorithm can be seen as a generalization of both, J.-F. Mestre's AGM Algorithm and T. Satoh's canonical lifting method. This algorithm depends on lifting an arithmetic invariant of the Jacobian curve in terms of theta constants. The theta null values are worked out with semi-canonical theta structures of level $2^{\\nu}p$ where $\\nu$ is an integer and $p$ is the characteristic of the base field $\\F_q$. The result of this article implies a possible affirmative answer to the question of whether there exists a quasi-quadratic time algorithm for computing the number of rational points on a generic ordinary abelian variety defined over a finite field."}
{"text":"\nWe focus on researching self-dual vertex operator algebras (VOAs) and vertex operator super algebras (SVOAs). By inspecting the correlation functions at the genus one level, it is proven that self-dual SVOAs only possess half-integral central charges. A procedure is elaborated on how to construct self-dual SVOAs from larger-central charge self-dual VOAs. Mention is made of the connection to integral lattices and binary codes. One of the prime yields to come out of the analysis is the formation of a shorter Moonshine module - a self-dual SVOA with a central charge of 23.5 - to which the Baby Monster - the second largest sporadic simple group - is integrated into by automorphisms. The shorter Moonshine module corresponds to a shorter Leech lattice and shorter Golay code, and its q-expansion character is q^(-47\/48)*(1+ 4371q^(3\/2)+ 96256q^2+ 1143745q^(5\/2) + ...). We evidence the hypothesis that this is the only SVOA with this characteristic. At the conclusion, we introduce the notion of extremal VOAs and SVOAs, which are self-dual (S)VOAs with a similar starting character to the vacuum representation of the Virasoro algebra at the same central charge. Discovery proves that extremal VOAs exist at least for the charges 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, and extremal SVOAs exist only for the charges c=0.5, 1, ..., 7.5, 8, 12, 14, 15, 15.5, 23.5 and 24. The instances of c=24 (resp. 23.5) are the (shorter) Moonshine modules. Once again, our findings are analogous to what has been ascertained from code and lattice research."}
{"text":"\n\nThis work utilizes a dynamic cluster quantum Monte Carlo algorithm to analyze the spin susceptibility representation of the pairing interaction in the two-dimensional Hubbard model with an on-site Coulomb interaction equal to the bandwidth for different doping levels. It was determined that the pairing interaction is approximately ${3\/2}\\Ub(T)^2\\chi(K-K')$ with a temperature and doping dependent coupling $\\Ub(T)$ and the numerically calculated spin susceptibility $\\chi(K-K')$. Low temperatures were found to be accurately expressed in terms of the single-particle self-energy when the spin susceptibility was incorporated. Our findings suggest that the strength of d-wave pairing, which is marked by the mean-field transition temperature, can be established through the use of dressed spin susceptibility and the nodal quasiparticle spectral weight. As a result, these studies have crucial implications in regards to the question of whether spin fluctuations are responsible for pairing in the high-T$_c$ cuprates."}
{"text":"\nIn this study, we concentrate on analyzing magnetic field (SOHO\/MDI), chromospheric (HASTA, Kanzelhoehe Solar Observatory, TRACE) and coronal (TRACE) observational data from two GOES M-class flares which occurred in active region NOAA 10486 in a three-hour period on 27 October, 2003. Our results demonstrate that the magnetic field topology associated with these flares can be explained in terms of a localized magnetic reconnection event happening at a coronal null point. The same null point still existed one day later, on 28 October, 2003 and was suggested as the cause of the large X17 flare at 11:01 UT on that day. Consequently, it may be concluded that coronal null points are stable topological structures where energy can be released through magnetic reconnection, as proposed by earlier magnetic reconnection models."}
{"text":"\nThis paper investigates how nonlinear control systems can be expressed using symbolic models, which are abstract representations of the continuous dynamics of the system. Symbolic models allow a unified language to study problems of control involving both physical and software components. Techniques from supervisory control and game theory can be applied to controller synthesis. Furthermore, the authors provide a method to construct symbolic models in which the approximation error is rendered as small as desired by the designer. If the state space of the control system is bounded, the symbolic model will become finite. For digital control systems, a quantization of the inputs provides the ability to construct symbolic models."}
{"text":"This paper presents an investigation of the exact charged solution exhibiting axial symmetry in the context of the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity (TEGR). The associated metric is constructed from a structure function $G(\\xi)=1-{\\xi}^2-2mA{\\xi}^3-q^2A^2{\\xi}^4$ which is of a fourth order nature, making calculations involved. We present a coordinate transformation to simplify the structure function into a factorisable form with $r_{\\pm}$ as the horizons of the Reissner-Nordstr$\\ddot{o}$m space-time. Next, the singularities of this space-time are studied. A second coordinate transformation is employed to obtain the tetrad field corresponding to the Reissner-Nordstr$\\ddot{o}$m black hole. The energy content of this tetrad field is derived with the gravitational energy-momentum, and the use of the regularised expression in the TEGR leads to an unvarying value for the energy."}
{"text":"We present a high resolution radio continuum survey of the Scd galaxy M33, revealing considerable extended emission from both the main and weaker arms. We have studied the scale length of total radio emission and the spectral index distribution with linear radio polarization, as well as measuring the north-south asymmetry in polarization. We found that beyond $R$ = 4 kpc, the spectral index increases faster and the exponential scale length is larger inside than outside. Additionally, there may be a correlation between cosmic rays and star forming regions inside the region of $R$ $<$ 4 kpc, and the asymmetry in polarization suggests a Faraday depolarization asymmetry."}
{"text":"\nUsing a cosmological N-body simulation, this study examines how satellites of group-sized halos are spatially and kinematically aligned relative to the orientation of the central substructure of their host groups (GCS, six times the virial radius, or Rvir). Three different types of spatial alignment were assessed: (1) the orientation of the GCS relative to its satellites, (2) the orientation of the satellite relative to its GCS, and (3) the direct alignment between the orientation of the GCS and its satellites. For each, three types of velocity alignment were also measured: (1) the velocity of the satellite relative to the connecting line between the satellite and the GCS, (2) the orientation of the GCS relative to the satellite velocities, and (3) the auto-orientation of satellite velocities relative to their orientations. Results showed that satellite halos tended to be distributed along the GCS's major axis up to 6 Rvir. Furthermore, the satellites preferentially pointed in the direction of the GCS, with the greatest signal concentration on small scales detectable up to 6 Rvir. All velocity alignments were found to be particularly marked in short-scale ranges. These results establish contradicting evidence - the halo alignments seeming to reflect extend beyond the virial radius, while the main radial alignments were deemed to derive from the satellites adjusting to the group tidal field. Findings were found to be consistent with those from larger galaxy surveys."}
{"text":"\nThis article presents a microscopic theory of quantum dot (QD) interactions with quantum light that considers the local-field-induced depolarization. A two-body Hamiltonian has been derived and expressed in terms of the incident electric field, with a separate term describing the depolarization effect of the QD. Through the equations of motion, this theory has been applied to the study of various types of excitations within the QD, such as a Fock qubit, coherent fields, vacuum state electromagnetic field light and arbitrary photonic state distributions.\n\nResults show the appearance of two oscillatory regimes in the Rabi effect when a QD is exposed to coherent light, separated by a bifurcation effect. The first regime does not reveal the standard collapse-revival phenomenon, with a negative population inversion, while the second regime greatly distorts the expected collapse-revival as compared to thestandard Jaynes-Cummings model. Moreover, in the linear regime, the local field induces a split in the absorbtion spectrum, usually dominated by a single line corresponding to the exciton transition frequency, and a shift of one component due to the local field coupling parameter. It has also been demonstrated that a strong light-matter coupling arises in a weak-field limit. Physical interpretation and further implications of the derived results are discussed."}
{"text":"\nUsing advanced Keck spectroscopy and Spitzer Space Telescope analysis, this study evaluates the outer limit of the Triangulum spiral galaxy M33. Photometry techniques had previously uncovered arcs at the commencement of the HI-warp, in a region of interstellar space encompassing stellar sources 0.6-2 Gyr in intermediate ages. Seven objects in the outer, northern arc with visual magnitudes as faint as V \u223c 25 mag were selected for spectroscopic study; results suggested a strong presence of CN absorption, affirming carbon star status. The Keck II spectra of a region 0.5 degrees from the galactic centre also yielded carbon stars. Concurrently, the IRAC 8 micron image of M33 divulged modifications in its spiral structure along the HI-warp. Our investigations ultimately propose that an extensive mixture of carbon stars in the periphery of the disk implies recent star formation due to gas inflow from the HI-warp."}
{"text":"In this article, we investigate the hierarchy of superstring isometries and hidden dimensions. Such transformations, which we refer to as $\\alpha$-symmetries, are induced by the presence of special space-time generators, allowing for the cancellation of variations in the matter and ghost parts of RNS formalism. We classify the $\\alpha$-symmetry generators according to the ghost cohomology, and associate each one with an associated hidden space-time dimension. Specifically, when considering a non-critical superstring with $d$-dimensions, we show that each ghost cohomology $H_{n}\\sim{H_{-n-2}}$ contains $d+n+1$ corresponding $\\alpha$-symmetry generators. Furthermore, by combining the generators from $H_{k}\\sim{H_{-k-2}},1\\leq{k}\\leq{n}$, the isometry group of the space-time is extended from the original $SO(d,2)$ to $SO(d+n,2)$. We also examine the case of $n=1$, a situation in which the $\\alpha$-symmetries were previously understood to come from a hidden dimension."}
{"text":"\nUsing the X-ray Imaging Spectrometer (XIS) onboard the Suzaku telescope, we have discovered a rare and transient X-ray source at the edge of an image taken during routine observation of a supernova remnant in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). We determined its position using ray-tracing simulations and discovered it had been absent from all images from other X-ray missions over the last 28 years. The properties of the source are consistent with those commonly seen among supersoft sources (SSSs), including a single blackbody with a temperature of ~72 eV, an interstellar extinction of ~4.9x10^{20} H atoms cm^{-2}, and an absorption edge at ~0.74 keV. If the source is at the distance of the SMC, the X-ray luminosity in the 0.2-2.0 keV band is ~10^{37} erg s^{-1}. The XIS light curve also showed a two-fold decline in X-ray flux during the 24 ks observation. Given the archived data and the observed flux in the burst, we have concluded that this is an outburst event of a SSS in the SMC."}
{"text":"\nWe present a study of a circumstellar disk inclined near edge-on around a young brown dwarf in the Taurus star-forming region. Combining data from the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility (SpeX) with mid-IR photometry and spectroscopy from the Spitzer Space Telescope and millimeter data from Scholz and coworkers, the spectral energy distribution (SED) of 2MASS J04381486+2611399 was modeled. The presence of silicate absorption at 10 um and silicate emission at 11 um constrained the inclination of the disk to be ~70 deg, i.e. ~20 degrees from edge-on. Hubble Space Telescope images revealed asymmetric bipolar extended emission also confirming this. Through modeling, it is deduced that the disk contains a large inner hole approximately 0.275 AU in radius, which is larger than is currently expected from embryo ejection models."}
{"text":"The CDF Collaboration has conducted an analysis of 955\/pb of data from CDF II to investigate the production of electroweak single top quark production at the Tevatron. Three different analysis techniques, including likelihood functions, neural networks, and the matrix element analysis, have been employed to detect a single top signal in line with the Standard Model. The results of the two preliminary analyses indicate that there is a deficit of single-top-like events and set upper limits on the production cross section. The matrix element analysis suggests a 2.3 sigma single top excess with a cross section  measurement of 2.7 \u00b11.5-1.3 pb. Additionally, the search for non-Standard Model production of single top quarks through a heavy W' boson resonance yielded no evidence for a signal. This data analysis has allowed for the exclusion of W' bosons at the 95 % C.L. with masses of 760 or 790 GeV\/c^2, based on whether the right handed neutrino is smaller or larger than the mass of the W' boson respectively."}
{"text":"\nIn this paper, we investigate the possibility of distinguishing the influence of a $(1+z)^6$ modification to the Friedmann equation through cosmological observations. Various interpretations of this extra term, including geometric changes associated with Loop Quantum Cosmology, braneworld models, metric-affine gravity and spinning fluid effects are considered. We use current measurements such as those of the coordinate distances from the Fanaroff-Riley type IIb (FRIIb) radio galaxy (RG) data, supernovae type Ia (SNIa) data, baryon oscillation peak and the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR) to assess the contribution of the extra $(1+z)^6$ term to the standard $\\Lambda$CDM model. We employ Bayesian model selection criteria such as the Bayesian factor, AIC, and BIC to identify if the additional parameters are detectable in current observations. Our results indicate that even though the $\\rho^2$ corrections are small, astronomical observations can detect them in principle. Nonetheless, our data does not support a bounce model associated with loop quantum effects, nor does it suggest that it differs from the $\\Lambda$CDM model."}
{"text":"A semi-empirical equation of state (EoS) has been developed to encompass the pressure-volume-temperature (p-V-T) relationships of elastic solids, with perovskite MgSiO3 being used for validation. Five parameters; Ko, Vo, alpha_o, pressure derivative of Ko, and pressure derivative of alpha_o, have produced the best fit of the EoS to experiment. Residuals of molar volume, pressure and temperature have a root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 0.043 cm3, 0.79 GPa, and 125K respectively, indicating an accurate fit. Furthermore, comparison of the semi-empirical EoS with the most widely used isothermal EoSs (Birch-Murnaghan, Vinet, Roy-Roy) indicated superior performance of the former in all temperatures, based on correlation coefficient, RMSD of the residuals and Akaike information criteria."}
{"text":"\nIn this article, we conducted two experiments, {\\it{KEK PS-E549\/E570}}, to collect higher-statistics data on strange tribaryon $S^0(3115)$.

At the same time, however, it is still possible that a much broader structure exists, and further analysis is needed to confirm whether this is true or not. In order to directly search for this possible structure, as well as to further understand the non-mesonic $K^-$ absorption reaction channel, a thorough examination of our data is being carried out."}

Making sure the observables are sensible and reliable, we find that the scalar unparticle should have a scaling dimension between $1$ and $2$. However, it is infeasible to ascertain an appropriate range of values of $d$ for the vector unparticle operator."}
{"text":"\nA hybrid model has been proposed to explain heavy ion fusion phenomena at deep\nsub-barrier energies where the tunneling probability is estimated based on both\nsudden and adiabatic approaches.

The main features of this model are a steep\nfall-off of the fusion cross section, a sharp increase of the logarithmic\nderivative L(E) with decreasing energy, and an astrophysical S-factor showing\na peak at deep sub-barrier energies, especially for near symmetric systems.\nThe model is able to explain experimental fusion measurements for various\nsystems, ranging from near symmetric ones such as $^{58}Ni+^{64}Ni,\n^{58}Ni+^{58}Ni$ and $ ^{58}Ni+^{69}Y$ to asymmetric ones like $^{16}O+^{208}Pb$,\nexhibiting surprising experimental patterns.

{"text":"\nThis paper presents a theoretical model for explaining the high frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in pulsars, black holes and white dwarfs. The model incorporates three circular tori around the star, where two carry charge and the third houses an electrically neutral mass. The given theory also proposes a new interpretation to the gravitomagnetic theory in order to explain low-frequency QPOs in pulsars and black holes. Furthermore, the effect of charge flow is contemplated to explain the frequency drifts of burst oscillations and the 410 kHz QPO in the pulsar SAX J1808.4--3658. In addition, the Lense-Thirring frequency and a modified formula derived from it are compared with data from pulsars. Lastly, for white dwarf stars, low frequency QPOs are suggested to stem from electromagnetic precession frequencies developed in the theory. Predictions from the model are compared to the data from the dwarf nova VW Hyi."}

{"text":"\nWe demonstrate a model of regular lattices whose links are composed of a series of Josephson junctions with large Josephson energy, $E_J$, compared to junction Coulomb energy, $E_C$.

The ground state properties are variable according to the parameter $q \\approx N^2 \\exp(-\\sqrt{8E_J\/E_C})$, which leads to superconductive states when $q < q_c$. This critical value of $q$ is further determined for magnetic frustrations $f=0$ and $f=\\frac12$.

{"text":"\nThis paper examines the potential indications of unparticles in low energy parity violation, as measured through isotope chains and the NuTeV experiment.

These parameters (i.e. $\\Lambda_{\\cal U}$, $d_{\\cal U}$, $c_{V{\\cal U}}$ and $c_{A{\\cal U}}$) could clarify the NuTeV discrepancy regardless of isoscalarity violation in combination with strange quark asymmetry, which happens to be consistent with restriction from $b\\to s\\gamma$ observations."}
{"text":"\nWe employ the WENO algorithm to analyze the growth of ionized regions around UV photon sources during the reionization epoch. Our research suggests that the volume expansion rate generally involves three phases: an early, rapid or relativistic expansion stage, a later, slower growth rate and a transition between the two. We also explore how tightly clustered UV photon sources will affect the growth speed - determined to be slower than for single sources of equivalent intensity. These results are pertinent to studies of the redshift-dependence of 21cm signals during this epoch."}
{"text":"\nIn this study, the evolution of magnetic fields over the main sequence lifetime of Ap stars is examined using observational data obtained from a survey of magnetic fields in Ap stars located in open clusters and associations.

The results suggest that magnetic fields in Ap stars remain relatively consistent from the Zero Age Main Sequence until the Terminal Age Main Sequence, with fields in stars greater than 3 Solar Masses decreasing with passing age. It is proposed that the current survey has become a powerful tool for understanding the evolution of magnetic Ap stars, and the collection of more precise data is underway in order to gain further clarity of the results."}
{"text":" The effects of electron and hole doping on a C$_{20}$ molecule, described by an extended Hubbard model with a nearest neighbor Coulomb interaction of strength $V$, are investigated using quantum Monte Carlo and exact diagonalization methods.

Magnetic properties of the neutral molecule are studied and transitions between spin singlet and triplet ground states for either fixed $U$ or $V$ values are found.

The current paper goes on to show that - on the macroscopic scale - this pattern of phonon and electron waves propels parallel electron waves, leading to a waveguide for supercurrent transmission with no loss. This can be further explored for unconventional superconductors like the cuprate materials, using spin waves instead of phonons. Such coherent lattice vibrations will aids in readily identifying superconductors and can mastered by presently available x-ray and neutron diffraction techniques. Further implications are brought to light in this paper."}
{"text":"We present a set of formulae which describe the Ozsvath-Szabo invariants of a 4-manifold created by combining two manifolds, M_1 and M_2, with non-trivial normal bundles and a common boundary of genus g>0. This result drew from a general theorem which states that the Ozsvath-Szabo invariants of the 4-manifold can be expressed in terms of Heegaard Floer homology with coefficients in certain Novikov rings. Through this theorem, these Ozsvath-Szabo invariants can be defined for even those 4-manifolds with b+ = 1, similar to what is done in Seiberg-Witten theory. By utilizing the product formulae derived from this theorem, we have been able to calculate the Ozsvath-Szabo invariants of various 4-manifolds and confirm their equivalence with the Seiberg-Witten invariants."}
{"text":"\nThis paper presents results of a new multi-annulus code to study the collisional evolution of extended debris discs. We focused on confirming the departure from the theoretical equilibrium size distribution of observable particles (1cm and below) in real discs, as well as studying the effects of collisional and radiative mixing on dust density profiles, scattered light luminosity, and SEDs. To study this, we considered a fiducial disc at 120AU radius with a surface density profile proportional to a power law. We then showed that the spatial extension of the disc played a major role by producing particles on eccentric or unbound orbits which heavily impacted the size distribution and collisional timescales in the disc. Small grains departed from the original profile, whereas large objects with the most mass still largely followed the initial profile, leading to flatter scattered light radial profiles. Ultimately, our work provides empirical formulas for the collisional size distribution and collision timescale, as well as an empirical law to trace the distribution of large unseen parent bodies from observations."}
{"text":"\nThis study investigates the chemical signatures and dynamical properties of the Milky Way's stellar halo. We analyze simulated halo stars divided into two different populations: those that formed before\/during the last major merger, and those that came from accretion of substructures after that event. Comparing the binding energy of stars within the two groups shows that the former are mainly located closer to the center at z=0, whereas those originating in small scale merging structures are spread through the halo. We also explore what possible chemical abundance signatures these two populations may exhibit. Additionally, it is predicted that primordial stars are spread throughout the halo, while the oldest stars are still mainly situated in the early collapsing, densest regions. Our findings lend support to the notion that the lack of metal-free stars indicates a constraint on the Population III initial mass function, and that the lowest metallicity stars may hold clues to the chemical yields of Population III stars."}
{"text":"This study analyzed the effects of Ni(II) stress on the macro-physiological response of Brassica juncea seedlings. Cs, Cp, and M, the concentration of metal in the growth medium, the concentration of metal taken in by the plant, and the total biomass achieved were investigated. Factors such as the Ni(II) concentration in the agar gel and diurnal light quanta (DLQ) were investigated as independent variables. Results demonstrated that increased light may increase Ni toxicity at both the root and whole plant levels, the shoot mass index is a possible indicator of shoot metal sequestration, Cp follows a logarithmic variation with Cs, and M is dependant on Cp in the form of a power-law. The study indicates that for B. juncea to effectively remove the most metal from the medium, the metabolic nature of the plant needs to be taken into consideration to reach a balance between rapid biomass growth and high metal concentration capability. These results have implications for engineering phytoremediation to maximize Cp and M concurrently."}
{"text":"\nWe have investigated the structure of mass matrices of the charged leptons and \nneutrinos in an extension of the Standard Model that is symmetric under the S_3 \ngroup, and have reparametrized them in terms of their eigenvalues. We have \nobtained analytical formulas for entries in the PMNS matrix, mixing angles, and \nMajorana phases, which yield a matrix that is near the tri-bimaximal form. We \nhave further calculated the matrices of the Yukawa couplings and the branching \nratios of leptonic flavour-changing neutral currents as dependent on the \nmasses of leptons and Higgs particles. The large mass gap between the leptons \nand their small mixing angles allow the S_3 and Z_2 symmetries to effectively \nsuppress the FCNC rates with respect to the current bounds by many orders of \nmagnitude."}
{"text":"\nWe analyze an explicit model of warped D-brane inflation which takes into account the contributions of moduli stabilization. We explore the potential of a D3-brane moving in a warped conifold background with fluxes and holomorphically-embedded D7-branes. The D7-branes modify the inflaton potential but do not alter the quadratic term in it, meaning that the slow-roll parameter eta is unaltered. However, by analyzing a specific example, the Kuperstein embedding of D7-branes, we show that it is possible to tune the potential so that it is flat enough for inflation. The importance of accounting for the change in the compactification volume as the D3-brane moves is highlighted and we explain how this leads to relations between parameters in the inflaton Lagrangian that must be taken into account. It turns out the shape of the resulting potential is drastically different from that predicted in prior studies and usually results in inflation occurring near an inflection point. We touch upon the challenges of making accurate cosmological predictions in this model. This work builds upon arXiv:0705.3837."}
{"text":"In this article, the aspects of Liouville Theory in relation to c<=1 are discussed. The analysis includes an examination of whether an interpretation with a timelike boson coincides with two-dimensional de Sitter asymptotic geometry. The conformal bootstrap further leads to a singular three-point function. Adding a metric on fields brings the conformal charge to the degenerate values of the topological minimal models. Regarding the continuous spectrum, the methods employed here differ compared to those of the minimal models. Prior studies of c=1 theory have demonstrted that it is analogous to a non-rational CFT, which arises in the limit of the unitary minimal models. Additionally, coupling the non-unitary theories with c<=-2 to unitary matter fields have resulted in string amplitudes reminiscent of the minimal strings."}
{"text":"\nWe explore the fate of the dust that is produced through Population III supernova (SN) explosions in addition to its processing by reverse shocks from the SN ejecta's interaction with the ambient environment. We focus on the transport of the dust within the SN remnant (SNR), its effects on the composition, size and total mass that survives within the SNR. We observe changes in the reverse shock based on the thickness of the progenitor star's envelope, with the transport and endurance of the dust grains depending on their initial size and composition. Our research shows that small grains with an initial size of under 0.05 microns are obliterated in the postshock flow while grains with a size between 0.05-0.2 microns are caught in the dense layer behind the forward shock. Very large grains with an initial size of 0.2 microns or above are released into the interstellar medium (ISM) without a dramatic decrease in size. We compute the total mass fraction of dust that is destroyed by the reverse shock, varying between 0.2 and 1.0, contingent on the energy of the explosion and ISM density. Our findings could have a considerable effect on the abundance pattern of the stars formed in primordial SNRs."}
{"text":"\nThis paper examines isospin-breaking effects in $\\phi\\rightarrow\\omega\\pi^0$, $J\/\\psi\\rightarrow\\omega\\pi^0,$ and $\\psi^\\prime\\rightarrow\\omega\\pi^0$ via hadronic loop interactions. We analyze the electromagnetic (EM) decays and intermediate meson exchanges to determine the various sources of decay. The current experimental data is used to provide a sound calculation of the EM decay form factor within a vector meson dominance (VMD) framework, though we determine that the EM transitions only contribute around 25-33% of the total branching ratio for $\\phi\\rightarrow\\omega\\pi^0$. The intermediate meson exchanges, which ignore the naive Okubo-Zweig-Iizuka (OZI) rule, represent an essential fraction of the isospin violation. Such exchanges, particularly $K\\bar{K}(K^*)$, $K\\bar{K^*}(K)$, and $K\\bar{K^*}(K^*)$ are evaluated with effective Lagrangians according to experimental parameters, providing us with results in good agreement with the data. Finally, we compare our results to those of $J\/\\psi(\\psi^\\prime)\\to \\omega\\pi^0$ and find that the contributions from the $K\\bar{K}(K^*)$, $K\\bar{K^*}(K)$, and $K\\bar{K^*}(K^*)$ loops are minimal, and thus the isospin violations are dominated by the EM transitions."}
{"text":"\nUsing a new model to reconstruct the sunspot numbers over the last few millennia, we analyse the timescale and occurrence of grand minima and maxima events. This data reveals that the events follow a non-exponential distribution, implying the association of these events with a stochastic\/chaotic process. We observe that grand minima are indicative of two different types: short (30-90 year) Maunder-type and longer ($>$110) Sp\\\"orer-type events, hinting at a deterministic behavior of the dynamo that may influence their length. Grand maxima follow an exponential distribution, which suggests they are determined by random processes. This new researched provides new observational evidence to further our understanding and inform long-term solar dynamo models."}
{"text":"\nThe analysis of supernova remnant 1987A has revealed that the rings around it are emitted by a plasma mainly composed of ionized and neutral hydrogen atoms with a density of 10^10 atoms per cubic metre and, at least, a dimension of plasma of 0.01 light-years. This high column density is greater than what is needed for an optically thick gas at Lyman frequencies (Case B). When heated to a temperature of 50,000 K, the gas begins to emit superradiant lines. This de-excitation process results in almost all of the available energy being emitted in a handful of competing modes. This can only be seen when the beams cross the highest column densities, and when viewed from Earth, three elliptical hollow cylinders appear, which form the visible rings. The brightness of the superradiant beams is also amplified by a quasi-resonant induced scattering of the rays emitted by the star in the equatorial ring. Because of this de-excitation process, the gas is quickly cooled and ionization decreases rapidly, resulting in the radial decrease of radiance of the ring and the formation of pearls when competing modes occur."}
{"text":"\nThis study investigates the mechanical response of actin networks created in vitro, focusing on determining the relationship between the structural parameters of the network: namely, the concentration of the cross-linking molecule (HMM), and the mechanical properties of the network. Using various techniques such as micro- and macro-rheology, we observe a transition from a network of entangled polymers to one in which homogeneous cross-linked phase is present. This transition is controlled by the average distance between cross-linkers, an intrinsic property of the network. Consequently, this research reveals that the micro- and macro-mechanical properties of isotropically cross-linked actin networks are ultimately conditioned by a single network parameter."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate the repercussions that initial states have on a quantum tomography experiment, such as the distinction between quantum process maps and dynamical maps. Two different preparation methods are inspected, stochastic preparation and preparation by measurements. The associated process maps indicate linear features in the former, while the latter can only be understood by bi-linear maps. Furthermore, a verification protocol to differentiate linear maps from bi-linear maps is suggested. In the end, we underline how the initialisation method can effect any quantum task involving interactions with the environment."}
{"text":"  This paper presents a detailed theoretical analysis of the possibility of providing a complete photonic band gap in two-dimensional photonic crystal slabs with a triangular lattice of triangular air holes, alongside a comparison with the more conventional triangular lattice of circular holes. This study utilizes the guided-mode expansion method to calculate the photonic mode dispersion below and above the light line, explore gap maps, and assess intrinsic diffraction losses of quasi-guided modes from the periodic lattice, as well as in line- and point-defects. The results of this research indicate that for both circular and triangular holes, a complete photonic band gap does exist for the fundamental guided mode but is generally limited by the presence of second-order waveguide modes. Additionally, various band gaps for odd modes may be tuned to achieve doubly-resonant frequency conversion between the even mode at the fundamental frequency and the odd mode at the second-harmonic frequency. Finally, the diffraction losses of quasi-guided modes in the triangular lattices are determined to be comparable. This paper elucidates the potential usefulness of the triangular lattice of triangular holes for nonlinear optics, and emphasizes the applicability of the guided-mode expansion method for calculating photonic band dispersion and diffraction losses, particularly for higher-lying photonic modes."}
{"text":"This study explored a quantum theory of exciton-photon interactions within photonic crystal slab waveguides that have quantum wells embedded in them. A Hopfield diagonalization technique was employed to quantize the electromagnetic field with a refractive index modulation and the exciton center of mass field in a periodic, piecewise constant potential. This gave rise to complex dispersion profiles of mixed exciton-photon states and identified two distinct coupling regimes - weak and strong. As a result, new quasi-particle excitations, referred to as photonic crystal polaritons, were discovered. These could be manifested as below-the-light line guided polaritons when resonance between excitons and non-radiative photon levels was observed, or as radiative polaritons located above the light line when the exciton-photon coupling strength was greater than the intrinsic radiative damping of the photon. Ultimately, an energy minimum of the lower polariton branch was observed close to the normal incidence angle. This may pave the way for realization of polariton parametric interactions in photonic crystal slabs."}
{"text":"\nIn this article we report a Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) experiment that distributed secure keys over a 200 km optical fibre with 42 dB channel loss - the highest to date. We achieved this by using a differential phase shift protocol at 10 GHz clock frequency and superconducting single photon detectors (SSPD) based on NbN nanowire. This system allowed us to secure 17 kbit\/s over 105 km of optical fibre and 12.1 bit\/s over 200 km of optical fibre; both of these are two orders of magnitude higher than the previous record. Furthermore, the secure keys are resistant against additional types of collective attacks on individual and multiple photons, like the sequential unambiguous state discrimination (USD) attack. Results from the experiment prove viable the potential of achieving secure global scale QKD networks using satellite communication."}
{"text":"\nThis paper examines the asymptotic behavior of total time when taking into account task failures. Two common ways of responding to failed tasks, resuming from a failure point or selecting a replacement task, are extensively documented. However, the paper focuses on a third alternative, referred to as RESTART, which has resisted detailed analysis until now. This work provides new insights into task time distributions, with heavy-tailed distributions observed when the initial task time has an unbounded support. The analysis combines Cram\u00e9r-Lundberg asymptotics with integral asymptotics, which sometimes requires the use of Tauberian theorems or direct calculations. Results are included for various scenarios."}
{"text":"\nInvestigation into the curious case of ferroelectricity in BiFeO3 at room temperature has been carried out via electric, \nmagnetic and Mossbauer spectroscopy measurements. Previously, solid-solutions of BiFeO3 with Pb(Ti,Zr)O3 provided \nevidence that a spontaneous electric polarization occurs in BiFeO3 at a temperature below its Curie temperature \nTC=1143K. To gain further insight, sizeable single crystals of BiFeO3 have been synthetized through a flux \nmethod, with the results of Piezoresponse Force Microscopy and P(E) loops demonstrating ferroelectricity at room \ntemperature. A relatively large polarization of around 60 microC\/cm2 was uncovered, a value only previously seen in \nthin films. In addition, magnetic measurements with a SQUID magnetometer and Mossbauer spectroscopy were also \nconducted, which indicated an anisotropic hyperfine field attributed to the magnetic cycloidal structure."}
{"text":"\nWe have developed a lattice Boltzmann method of which the stability and accuracy are adapted to the compressible flow at high speed. Our model is formed by the discrete-velocity model by Kataoka and Tsutahara, combined with an appropriate finite-difference scheme and a supplementary dissipation term, which allows for adapting the model parameters to the von Neumann stability condition. We analyze the effect of the model parameters and proffer some suggested values. Our model, applied with a Mach number of at least 30, is verified by several benchmark tests. It also works on extreme Riemann problems with a pressure to density ratio of 1000:1, with satisfactory stability and accuracy. We prove that this model is competent to deal with complex non-equilibrium processes. The new scheme to ensure stability can be extended to other lattice Boltzmann models."}
{"text":"\nUsing the dynamics of the shell model, which is a simplified form of the quasispecies model for infinite populations, along with the Wright-Fisher dynamics for finite populations, we investigate the evolutionary behaviour of the most strongly populated genotype on a rugged fitness landscape. We track this genotype as it changes when the population advances from one fitness peak to another in the process of adaptation. We discover that the fraction of the genotype obtained from the quasispecies model and the shell model match at certain genotypes and moments in time, yet the dynamics of both models are exactly the same in questions surrounding the most populated genotype. We obtain analytic calculations for certain properties of the jumps which were previously calculated numerically in other works. Simulation results for finite populations present that the jump distribution decreases over time as $t^{-2}$ which is the same as in the quasispecies problem."}
{"text":"\nA cosmological scenario is established through curved-inspired modified gravity which contains Non-Linear terms of $R^2$ and $R^{(r+2)}$,  beginning at the Plank Scale. In this scenario, a unified picture of cosmology is explored, with the result that the universe starts with power-law inflation, followed by deceleration, accelerates  and may possibly collapse in the future. This proposition differs from the traditional Dark Energy models, in that the Dark Energy terms are recovered from the modified gravitational sector. Further, dark radiation and dark matter components arise from the same sector. The properties of the Dark Energy appear to be quintessential in the early universe and phantom-like in the late universe. Additionally, a tension term, dubbed cosmic tension, is recovered from this framework. This term has implications similar to that of loop quantum effects when $\\lambda > 0$, and the brane-gravity corrections when $\\lambda < 0$, in the Friedmann equation of the late universe."}
{"text":"\nWe propose a heuristic model to demonstrate how feedback related to galaxy formation could manifest in a scale-dependent bias between mass and light on even large scales. The formation of galaxies is impacted both by the local density field and existing galaxies, resulting in a structured, rather than stochastic, bias. Features in the large-scale galaxy power spectrum, such as baryons influencing the primordial transfer function, can also be produced within this deterministic model. Another consequence is a stochastic appearance in the galaxy distribution, potentially providing new insights into the structure of our universe."}
{"text":"This paper provides an in-depth look at the critical behaviour of a variety of\nirreversible reaction systems, with the primary focus being on recent advances in\nunderstanding phase transitions and their numerical simulations. The Langevin formulation is discussed, and subsequent sections detail Monte Carlo approaches and finite-size scaling analysis. The paper also touches on the study of some first-order phase transitions observed in catalytic oxidation and reduction of carbon monoxide and nitrogen monoxide, as well as the oxidation of hydrogen, ammonia synthesis and other reactions. Experiments related to these processes, and the comparison between numerical results and measurements are also discussed. Finally, this paper provides insight on areas which could welcome further research, as well as identifying open questions."}
{"text":"This article focuses on the design of a better embedder and detector (or decoder) for use in digital watermarking systems. It provides a summary of key applications of watermarking technology and its various schemes. Additionally, it investigates the optimum detector or decoder corresponding to a particular probability distribution of host signals, as well as a new host-interference rejection technique for multiplicative spread spectrum schemes. Finally, a double-sided technique is introduced which utilizes the host interference at its embedder and facilitates the implementation of perceptual analysis for maximum allowable embedding level."}
{"text":"\nThis article examines the effectiveness of mix networks running on unstructured topologies such as social networks and scale-free random networks. We analyze the efficiency and anonymity of mix networks on structured and unstructured topologies under high latency conditions and with one case study of LiveJournal\u2019s friendship network. Our results show that the route lengths between mixes in unstructured networks are similar to those in expander graphs, while it is more difficult to protect against intersection attacks and mix networks require an order of magnitude higher batch sizes than expander graphs. Furthermore, we find that compromising the most central nodes has a limited effect on the network's anonymization capabilities."}
{"text":"\nA study was done to explore the means by which a magnetically-dominated molecular cloud forms from an atomic cloud. This was accomplished by using a time-dependent axisymmetric magnetohydrodynamic code to track the evolution of the cloud, which was initially in thermally stable equilibrium with its surrounding hot, ionized gas. The fast-mode shock that passed through the hot medium encountered the cloud, causing the matter behind it to become thermally unstable and have a reduced $\\beta$ ratio, which enabled magnetohydrodynamic waves to produce high-density clumps in a less dense warm environment. Subsequently, the slow-mode shock produced a dense shell that fragmented. This fragmenting shell formed the primary region for the creation of massive stars. Our simulations suggesting that only weak and moderate-strength shocks can form cold clouds with the characteristics of giant molecular clouds."}
{"text":"This paper provides an exploration into the notion of system complexity, examining three states of complexity - simple, complicated, and complex - as well as their associated properties. Examples of complex systems in Physics and Biology are discussed, as well as the potential applications of this phenomenon in man-made systems. Consideration is given to the difficult balance between relative system isolation and the required delegation of new capabilities from outside, leading to the reorganization of the classical system triplet {effector-sensor-controller}. It is emphasized that entering the complexity state opens the possibility of allowing function to feedback onto structure, to better replicate the biotic inventions of Nature."}
{"text":"\nIn this article, we investigate the pair-production of doubly-charged scalars at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). This entails looking at doubly-charged Higgs bosons that form part of an SU(2)_L triplet - the main source of left-handed neutrino masses. These pair-production processes are, unlike single-production, not hindered by the associated vacuum expectation value. We discuss two-photon processes that contribute significantly to H++H++ production, in addition to Drell-Yan production. In addition, we review in detail the decays of the doubly-charged Higgs into l+l+ and W+W+ to craft a better signal-to-background ratio. We find that, given certain conditions, the doubly charged scalar can be detected up to a mass of 1 TeV (ll channel) and 700 GeV (WW channel) with 300 fb^-1 integrated luminosity. Also, such a Higgs, if it is part of a triplet generating neutrino masses, cannot survive for long on a collider scale. Nevertheless, its decay may lead to a temporally displaced secondary vertex if its mass is less than 250 GeV."}
{"text":"\nIn this paper, we conduct a thorough exploration of conservation laws and potential\nsymmetries of the class of one-dimensional linear parabolic equations. To do so, we use admissible transformations, the concept of normalized classes and the adjoint variational principle. We completely characterize all the possible potential conservation laws and prove that they are absolutely exhausted by only local conservation laws. For each equation of the class, our results enable us to determine a characteristic space of local conservation laws that are isomorphic to the solution set of the adjoint equation. Furthermore, we establish criteria for the existence of potential symmetries that rely on the interplay of various considerations such as potential equations, dual Darboux transformations, and equivalence groups. With the theoretical tools obtained, we examine generalized potential symmetries and apply them to the linear heat equation. This ultimately gives us a classification of its potential symmetries in terms of its point symmetry group. Lastly, we provide an in depth exploration of equations featuring infinite series of potential symmetry algebras."}
{"text":"\nThis article examines the fractal geometric features of the Minkowski question mark function $Q$ and reveals the connection between the Hausdorff dimensions of three distinct subsets, namely, $\\Lambda_{0}:=\\{x:Q'(x)=0\\}$, $\\Lambda_{\\infty}:=\\{x:Q'(x)=\\infty\\}$, and $\\Lambda_{\\sim}:=\\{x:Q'(x)$ does not exist and $Q'(x)\\not=\\infty\\}.$ It provides theoretical evidence that the dimensional hierarchy of the subsets, starting with $\\dim_{H}(\\nu_{F})$ and ending with $\\dim_{H}(\\Lambda_{0})=1$, is a result of the Stern-Brocot multifractal decomposition of the unit interval at the level set of the Farey map's topological entropy $h_{\\mathrm{top}}=\\log2$. Moreover, insights into the multifractal formalism and its non-trivial applications are presented."}
{"text":"\nThis article explores the possibility that gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) explode into the strong winds of their Wolf-Rayet progenitor stars, as suggested by the coincidence of long GRBs with Type Ib\/c supernovae. Evidence for this hypothesis is drawn from observations of X-ray afterglows when X-rays are below the cooling frequency, pre-jet break optical and X-ray afterglows, as well as the sharp turn-on observed for some afterglows. Further supporting evidence is provided by observations of short bursts, which are expected to be interacting with a constant density medium. Whilst radio observations do not generally support the constant density model for long bursts, a number of other observations indicate strong evidence for its presence. To account for this phenomenon, it is hypothesized that a termination shock is necessary near the deceleration radius, potentially due to a high pressure environment, a high progenitor velocity, or particular evolution prior to the GRB. However, this cannot be plausibly accommodated and may point to some long bursts having compact binary progenitors, exploding directly into the interstellar medium."}
{"text":"This article examines the characteristic behavior of general cosmological singularities and how this can be interpreted through a conformal approach. By factoring out the expansion along geodesics, a regularized state space picture is created from a conformal transformation. We go on to explain the 'cosmological billiard attractor' which describes the typical dynamical behavior of a generic spacelike singularity and its comparison to the metric approach of Belinskii, Lifschitz, and Khalatnikov and the Iwasawa based Hamiltonian method. In conclusion, the cosmological billiards and cosmological billiard attractor are shown to be complementary representations of the generic dynamics of a generic spacelike singularity."}
{"text":"This paper presents a virtual sensor based approach to fault detection and classification on a Lam 9600 plasma etch reactor. A series of models utilising data from real sensors such as Lam Station sensors, Optical Emission Spectroscopy, and RF Monitoring are developed and used to estimate recipe setpoints and wafer state characteristics. Fault detection and classification are then performed by comparing these predicted values with expected values. The implementation of such virtual sensor models allows for the detection and classification of faults, and can also provide a means of cross-checking that the process is maintaining the required setpoints, as well as the estimation of wafer state characteristics. This process is beneficial in terms of increasing production yield and reducing per unit cost by providing the opportunity to adjust the process or machine before etching further wafers."}
{"text":"\nThis paper introduces the study of the spectral properties of the volume operator in Loop Quantum Gravity, an application of a quantum theory to the description of three dimensional space-time. Our work considers vertex embeddings of valence greater than four, which is novel in the field. We have shown that the geometry of the vertex underlies the spectral properties of the volume operator, including the presence of a minimum value and observed the connection between gauge invariance and vertex embedding. Furthermore, we study the sets of non-diffomorphic, non-coplanar embeddings on vertices of degree 5-7, discovering these can be used to inform the gauge group's properties. We also present analytical results from the spectrum of 4-valent vertices, where a volume gap can be explicitly proved. Further details are outlined in our sibling paper."}
{"text":"This article investigates the Boltzmann equation for inelastic Maxwell models in order to ascertain the effects of simple shear flow on the velocity moments. Specifically, the results show that, with increasing shear rate, the rheological properties (involving the second-degree velocity moments) are determined by the coefficient of restitution $\\alpha$ while third-degree and asymmetric fourth-degree moments tend to zero in the limit of long times once they are scaled with the thermal speed. The symmetric fourth-degree moments diverge, for a given $\\alpha$, for shear rates larger than some defining critical value $a_c^*(\\alpha)$. The article also outlines the explicit shear-rate dependence of the fourth-degree moments below $a_c^*(\\alpha)$."}
{"text":"\nThis paper explores the problem of optimizing a financial agent's expected utility of terminal wealth when there is an unbounded random endowment and a utility function with the capacity to support both positive and negative wealth. We prove that an optimal trading strategy exists within a prescribed class of strategies with a supermartingale-based wealth process under pricing measures of finite relative entropy. Necessary and sufficient conditions are proposed for utility-based arbitrage avoidance and the solution to the primary problem. Two utility-based approaches, marginal utility-based price processes (MUBPP's) and utility indifference prices, are utilized in the pricing of contingent claims. Characterization of MUBPP's as local martingales under the normalized optimal dual measure for the utility maximizing investor is outlined. Furthermore, properties of utility indifference pricing, such as continuity and volume asymptotics for the context of unbounded endowment and claims, are presented."}
{"text":"This paper presents a compilation method for two types of unitary operators used in the evaluation of binary NAND formulas. We apply the CSD (Cosine Sine Decomposition), a matrix decomposition technique from linear algebra, to compile the oracle and non-oracle evolution operators used in recent papers proposing quantum algorithms for evaluating NAND formulas via quantum walks on tree graphs. Our methods are applied to the case of balanced binary NAND trees. We outline the SEOs and their associated quantum circuits for the compilation of the operators."}
{"text":"\nAn investigation of the star-forming regions of the M33 spiral galaxy has revealed a consistent pattern of stellar formation on a wide range of size scales, from approximate 20pc to 1kpc. In contrast to prior studies, which were limited in scale, this undertaking found no definitive characteristic size for OB associations, likely due to resolution and selection effects. The luminosity function of the star-forming regions closely fit a power-law model with an index of -2, comparable to that of clusters and Giant Molecular Clouds (GMCs). Additionally, mass-radius proportions for the groups closely resembled those of GMCs. A log-normal distribution appeared to explain the size distribution of the groups, and suggested that within a hierarchical structure, a given scale for structural identification would produce a Log-Normal size distribution. Finally, a rapid declines in the number of star-forming groups was detected beyond a galactic radius of ~4kpc, possibly indicating a shift in the star-forming ISM which would explain the lack of observed GMCs past this point."}
{"text":"We have conducted a deep search for the progenitor of the Type Ic Supernova 2002ap by employing pre-explosion observations from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. Aligning high-resolution Hubble Space Telescope observations of the supernova with the archival CFHT images enabled us to identify the location of the progenitor site on the ground-based observations. We were able to conclude that an observed source close to the SN position was not the progenitor, due to its visibility post-explosion, with late-time observations taken with the William Herschel Telescope. Comparisons to stellar models indicate that any single star progenitor could have experienced at least twice the standard mass loss rate during pre-Wolf-Rayet evolution, been initially more massive than 30-40 solar masses, and exploded as a Wolf-Rayet star with a final mass of 10-12 solar masses. Also possible is a scenario of an initially less massive progenitor, but in an interacting binary system. We have deduced that any possible binary companion would be a main-sequence star of less than 20 solar masses, a neutron star, or a black hole. By combining limits from pre-explosion obvervations, ejecta mass estimates and constraints from X-ray and radio observations, we have concluded that any binary interaction most likely happened during a Case B mass transfer, with or without a subsequent common envelope evolution phase."}
{"text":"\nThis paper investigates the way in which reachability-based secrecy may be related to equivalence-based secrecy. It is determined that reachability-based secrecy implies equivalence-based secrecy for digital signatures, symmetric and asymmetric encryption, when the primitives used are probabilistic. Additionally, for active adversaries, there are sufficient conditions that help reach the same result. The study focuses on the ways in which reachability-based secrecy can ensure strong security, and provides decidability results and automatic tools to help."}
{"text":"\nThis paper investigates the spectra of the secondary particles (other than $\\pi^0$'s) and $\\gamma$-rays produced in cosmic-ray ($p$'s and $\\alpha$'s) interactions with the interstellar medium. We use the Monte Carlo particle collision code DPMJET3.04 to derive an easy-to-use $\\gamma$-ray production matrix for cosmic rays with energies up to 10 PeV and apply it to the GeV excess in diffuse Galactic $\\gamma$-rays discovered by EGRET. Our conclusion is that the non-$\\pi^0$ decay components are not enough to explain the GeV excess, but do contribute a different spectrum to the $\\pi^0$-decay component. We also use the $\\chi^2$ statistics to evaluate the hypothesis that the TeV-band $\\gamma$-ray emission of the shell-type SNR RX J1713.7-3946 detected with HESS is caused by hadronic cosmic rays accelerated by a cosmic-ray modified shock. We find that a continuously softening spectrum is favoured, as opposed to an expected hardening. However, with a hard cutoff at 50-100 TeV, the hardening spectrum has about a 1% probability of explaining the HESS data."}
{"text":"\nThis paper examines a collaborative framework to facilitate the exchange and sharing of information related to the product and processes in the supply chain context. To achieve this, the Product Process Collaboration Organization (PPCO) model, the Viewpoint model and a communication layer based on XML are proposed. The PPCO model defines product and process information and methods of collaboration for parties in the supply chain. The Viewpoint model outlines the relations between actors and the bigger Product\/Process model as well as each actor's domain of interest. Moreover, a typology of exchanged messages is introduced. With an example related to the design of a new piston, this paper showcases the proposed framework's ability to ensure the retrieval of the necessary information from the PPCO layer."}
{"text":"\nWith the help of DPMJET3.04, a particle collision code, we obtain the multiplicity spectrum of various secondary particles, including $\\gamma$-rays, produced in cosmic-ray interactions with the interstellar medium. Additionally, we develop a $\\gamma$-ray production matrix applicable to cosmic-ray energies up to 10 PeV. Utilizing this production matrix, we can determine that the GeV $\\gamma$-rays in diffuse Galactic radiation observed by EGRET do not have a significant contribution from the non-$\\pi^{0}$ decay components. Further, based on the hypothesis that RX J1713.7-3946's TeV $\\gamma$-rays arise from cosmic-ray acceleration, our data from HESS seems to imply a slowly-softening spectrum, conversely to what had been anticipated. On the other hand, a hardening spectrum may explain this phenomenon if there is a hard cutoff in the particle spectrum at 50-100 TeV."}
{"text":"\n\nWe use high-resolution mid-infrared spectroscopy of 53 ULIRGs at z<0.32 observed with the Spitzer IRS instrument to gain insights into the power source behind their infrared emission. Our spectra show a range of fine structure emission lines (e.g. Ne, O, S, Si and Ar) as well as molecular and atomic Hydrogen emission lines. Diagnostics based on the fine-structure lines, the equivalent widths and luminosities of PAH features, and the strength of the 9.7um silicate absorption feature (S_sil) indicate that the majority of ULIRGs are powered mainly by star formation, although detection of the 14.32um [NeV] line in roughly 42% of the sample suggests that an AGN could contribute significantly to the mid-infrared flux in this subset of ULIRGs. We find that the NLRs of ULIRGs are more compact and more extincted than those in lower-luminosity starbursts, but that their excitation and electron densities are comparable. We also establish a correlation between the combined luminosity of the 12.81um [NeII] and 15.56um [NeIII] lines with both IR luminosity and the luminosity of the 6.2 micron and 11.2 micron PAH features in ULIRGs, and use this to derive a calibration between PAH luminosity and star formation rate. Finally, a S_sil ratio in the range of 0.8 to 2.4 is likely to indicate a ULIRG mainly powered by star formation, while S_sil ratios lower than 0.8, and possibly higher than 2.4, indicate the presence of a strong AGN."}
{"text":"\nWe present a study of strong (W_r(2796) > 0.3A) MgII absorbers at redshifts 0.3-2.5, using 33 observed with the VLT\/UVES and 23 previously observed with HIRES\/Keck. We found no evidence of evolutionary trends in equivalent width or the velocity spread of the MgII 2796 profile. However, the fraction of absorbing pixels within the full line-of-sight velocity range decreases with decreasing redshift, indicating that higher redshift absorbers have stronger, more interconnected components. We propose that low redshift absorbers are dominated by mature, disk\/halo like structures, while high redshift absorbers reveal protogalactic relationships with multiple merger and accretion events. Our findings are consistent with hierarchical galaxy formation theory, as seen in deep surveys."}
{"text":"\nThis paper investigates the kinematics of 8 newly discovered ultra-faint dwarf galaxies near the Milky Way, using Keck\/DEIMOS spectroscopy to measure velocity dispersions ranging from 3.3 to 7.6 km\/s. These galaxies have a mass-to-light ratio which is highly dark matter-dominated and an inverse relationship between their luminosity and the velocity dispersions. Additionally, we measure the metallicity of the observed stars and confirm the luminosity-metallicity relationship found in the brighter dwarf galaxies by two orders of magnitude, with some having mean metallicities as low as [Fe\/H] = -2.3. Using this information, we discuss how the ultra-faint dwarfs may contribute to decline in missing satellite problem, which describes the discrepancy between the expected number of satellites and the observed amount. After accounting for the sky coverage of the SDSS survey, this study suggests that if galaxy formation in low-mass dark matter halos is strongly suppressed after reionization, the simulated circular velocity function of CDM subhalos can be brought into approximate agreement with the observed velocities of Milky Way satellite galaxies."}
{"text":"\nGalaxy cluster merger statistics play a major role in our understanding of how large-scale structures form. However, identifying such mergers within observational data is hard to achieve. We therefore employed N-body simulations to study the characteristics of massive halo mergers, particularly looking at the effectiveness of close halo pairs as a proxy for such mergers. We evaluated this for a variety of merger timescales, masses, and redshifts, in both overdense and underdense environments. We found that close halo pairs represent only a small number of all sorts of mergers, and the application of this method in redshift space will lead to an inaccurate result. We extended our research to the coagulation of halo mass functions, which demonstrates that halos with separations of a few Mpc\/h merge less efficiently in overdense areas. This can be used to describe the halo merger rate using a merger kernel. Ultimately, our findings can be applied to mergers of field galaxies at higher redshifts."}
{"text":"\nUsing a sample of 20 Seyfert galaxies at z=0.36 combined with Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging and spectroscopic information from the Keck Telescope, we investigate the cosmic evolution of black holes and host spheroids by determining the black hole mass-luminosity (M-L) relation, the Fundamental Plane and the M-sigma relation. We find that the host spheroids present less luminosity and stellar velocity dispersion than today assuming pure luminosity evolution. This suggests an increase in stellar mass of approximately 60% in the next 4 billion years to obey the three local scaling relations. Systematic errors and selection effects cannot explain the observed offset. We conclude that the measured evolution can be expressed by M\/M_sph ~ (1+z)^{1.5+-1.0}, and hypothesise possible incursion from collisional mergers with disk-dominated systems as the dominant evolutionary mechanism."}
{"text":"\nRecent observations of the LCDM cosmology suggest that dark matter halos primarily grow by the accretion of smaller halos which each contain one luminous red galaxy (LRG). This process would ultimately lead to a larger number of halos than that which is observed currently. To reconcile this discrepancy, it is hypothesized that LRGs merge or disintegrate on relatively short timescales (~2Gyr). This prediction agrees with established dynamical friction calculations and implies that 2-3 LRGs have merged or dissipated within each halo more massive than 10^14Msun at present day. The amount of stellar mass accreted into the halos quantify with current observations, when the intracluster light (ICL) is taken into account. Additionally, if those disrupted LRGs are the sources of ICL, systematic amounts of ICL should surround satellite LRGs, which is corroborated by recent Virgo cluster observations. Consequently, simultaneous constancy of clustering strength and halo occupation distribution indicate that merging or disruption of massive galaxies occurs at late times."}
{"text":"\nWe studied the Galactic supernova remnant G299.2$-$2.9 using the Chandra X-Ray Observatory. We were able to see the X-ray-bright knots and shell, as well as some faint, diffuse emission in the center of the SNR. The X-ray findings suggest that G299.2$-$2.9 is located at a distance of around 5 kpc and is $\\sim$ 4500 years old, with an initial blast energy of 1.6 $\\times$ 10$^{50}$ ergs. The SNR appears to have occurred in an area of heavily varied density and is surrounded by a partial shell between 7 and 9 pc in radius. Metal-rich ejecta provides strong evidence that this is a Type Ia supernova. There is no evidence of light elements from the stellar ejecta, such as oxygen or neon."}
{"text":"\nWe examine how variations in the boundaries of an overmoded cavity can impact the randomness of its interior acoustic or electromagnetic field. This field can be viewed as an ideal incoherent, statistically homogeneous, and isotropic random scalar or vector field, respectively. We construct a physical model which indicates that the field dynamics can be recognized as an advanced diffusion process. We work out the Langevin-It\\^{o} and Fokker-Planck equations, in order to determine the contentions and distributions of the complex analytic field, its magnitude, and energy density. We discover the energy diffusion factor to be relative to the square of the ratio of the standard deviation of the source field to the deciding time continual of the dynamic procedure, yet independent of the beginning energy density, as first order. The energy drift vanishes asymptotically. The time-energy probability distribution is generally separate, due to nonstationarity. We provide a broad solution of the Fokker-Planck equation in an integral type, as well as explicit closed form solutions for certain asymptotic cases. Our discoveries stretch out beyond those of known results on statistics and distributions of quasi-stationary ideal random fields (ordinary diffusions), which are admired as extraordinary cases."}
{"text":"This article investigates the potential of Dirac Neutrinos as the composition of dark matter. A model-independent summary is given of the four main parameters determining the relic density and direct detection: mass, couplings to the Z, to the Z' and to the Higgs. The article additionally explores how extended electroweak gauge groups and discrete symmetries allow for these WIMP candidates to be stable, as well as describing how the extra Z' tends to couple mainly to the third generation, therefore avoiding various existing constraints. Ultimately, a warped GUT model is used to illustrate the situation."}
{"text":"\nInvestigating the effects of AGN feedback on galaxy formation, observations of 14 post-starburst galaxies at z=0.6 have revealed Mg II 2796,2803 absorption lines that indicate the presence of massive outflows of gas. These outflows, travelling at velocities of 490 - 2020 km\/s, are hypothesized to be the result of AGN-driven galactic winds triggered near the peak of the galaxies' activity.  This may explain why star formation has been shut down in these galaxies, as the gas velocities observed are intermediate between those of starbursts and quasars. This evidence supports the idea that AGN feedback is capable of quenching star formation across an entire galaxy."}
{"text":"\nIn this paper, we investigate the use of compressed regression for achieving sparse linear models from noisy data in high-dimensional settings. To achieve this, we compress the original $n$ input variables by random linear transformations to $m \\ll n$ data points in $p$ dimensions first. We provide conditions under which one can accurately estimate the model parameters with a high probability, as well as asymptotic performance and privacy bounds on the mutual information between the data before and after the compression. Our results demonstrate that compressed regression is able to achieve effective sparsity and privacy preserving properties."}
{"text":"\nIn this work, we analyze the features of stellar cluster M82F by applying multi-band high resolution Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging, along with deep ground-based optical slit and integral field spectroscopy. We note a large amount of substructure among the color maps, which is likely caused by differential extinction across the projected face of the cluster. Utilizing this information, we are able to construct an extinction map of the region, with which we derive the intrinsic flux. Comparing the two, we make the conclusion that the cluster is 15-30% larger than estimated in preceding studies, and that no strong evidence of mass segregation is present. Furthermore, review of the optical spectra point toward an age of 60-80 Myr, and a conclusion that the cluster is not physically associated with the HII region its projected upon. Reconstructed integral field maps demonstrate the majority of the line emission is due to a nearby HII region, with spatial line-width variations corresponding to the previously created extinction map. With this wealth of data, we have yet to determine the cause of the high light-to-mass ratio and possible top-heavy stellar IMF for this cluster."}
{"text":"A novel analysis of the cosmic acceleration is put forward in the article. The results of this analysis show through the use of supernovae observations and measurements of the ratio between the comoving distance to the last scattering surface and the SDSS+2dfGRS BAO distance scale, that the transition from deceleration to acceleration occurred at a redshift z_t=0.84+0.17-0.13, with a transition width of \\tau =0.51-0.17+0.23. Moreover, in the general case where the final value for the deceleration parameter is allowed to take on any negative value, the combined tests impose constraints on the present value of the deceleration parameter (q_0)."}
{"text":"\nThe results of this letter demonstrate that most of the near infrared background observed between 0.8 and 1.8 microns can be attributed to galaxies with a redshift of less than 8. When subtracting all of the known sources from an F110W image of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field, we found that the fluctuation power at 1.1 microns is consistent with that of faint sources at z<8 and inconsistent with that from sources at z>8. Additionally, while predicting the fluctuation power at 3.6 and 4.5 microns with numerically redshifted model galaxy spectral energy distributions, we determined that the predicted power of galaxies within the redshift range of 0-12 accurately matches the observed fluctuation power, while the power predicted for z>13 galaxies is much higher than that observed. Therefore, the data collected shows that the near infrared background emanates primarily from galaxies in the redshift range of 0.5-1.5."}
{"text":"This article delves into the analysis of the polarizability of lithium clusters with up to 22 atoms. A database of geometrical structures was created and the finite-field method was applied to determine the full polarizability tensor for each size. The results from density functional theory (in the form of Gaussian basis sets and the NRLMOL suite of codes) show that the average polarizability per atom declines from 11 to 9 Angstrom^3 in the 8-22 size range and is smoother than the experimentally obtained values. Additionally, changes in the degree of anisotropy of the polarizability in different conformations were observed while some cases with an odd atom number show elevated spin states."}
{"text":"\nThis study investigates the effects that changes in nuclear reaction rates have on simulations of classical novae explosions. Novae are a major contributor to the Galactic chemical evolution and are known to release substantial amounts of processed material into the interstellar medium. The amount of matter released to the ISM, the contributions to both nitrogen and oxygen isotopes, and the pre-solar grains identified in meteoritic material are all predicted to be affected by variations in nuclear reaction rates. We provide insight into the nuclear reaction rates necessary to produce an accurate simulation of a nova explosion, and assess their impacts on the overall potential contributions of these explosions to the Galactic chemical evolution."}
{"text":"This article presents a multi-band analysis of GRB 051028's optically dark afterglow, utilizing the Lulin observatory's 1.0m telescope and the WIDGET robotic telescope system. Upon measuring R-band photometric data points on zero-point-nine-five and one-point-eight days after the burst, a plateau in the optical light curve was identified. While its shape was reminiscent of optically bright afterglows, the magnitude was three magnitudes fainter than that of GRB 020124. Examining the spectrum analysis of X-rays, no significant host-galaxy absorption was inferred. Further computational modelling of the Ly$\\alpha$ absorption could not confirm a high redshift. These results dispelled both the high-redshift and the high-extinction hypotheses on the optically dark burst, leading to the conclusion that the afterglow was, intrinsically, dim."}
{"text":"\nUsing Monte Carlo simulations, we analyze the effects of order and disorder on the jamming and percolating processes resulting from the random sequential adsorption of dimers on binary alloys. Equimolar mixtures are obtained by applying the Ising model and the substrate annealing temperature $T$ is used to characterize the different types of substrates. At the Onsager critical temperature ($T_{c}$), changes in jamming and percolation features are produced, visible in a density-temperature phase diagram with three distinct regions. We find that jamming phenomena prevailing when $T < T^{*} = 1.22 T_{c}$ hinder the emergence of percolating clusters, and only become possible when $T > T^{*}$. Furthermore, at values close to $T^{*}$, fluctuations are restrained due to the interplay between jamming and percolation, presenting different exponents than those of the standard percolation universality class. By analyzing the threshold of percolation through thermal scaling Ansatzes, together with the fractal dimension of the percolating cluster, it is concluded that the universality class of standard percolation is preserved for all temperatures."}
{"text":"In this report, we present the results of the Spitzer Legacy Project ``From Molecular Cores to Planet-forming Disks'' (c2d) to assess circumstellar disks around weak-line T Tauri stars (wTTs) in Ophiuchus, Lupus, and Perseus Molecular Clouds. Our census finds that around 20% of magnitude-limited wTTs display detectable infrared (IR) excesses, indicating the presence of circumstellar disks with nearly three to six times higher frequency than the one detected in isolated areas. Subsequently, we infer the timescale of planet building to be close to 1 million years (Myr) in which up to 50% of young wTTs do not exhibit an IR-excess. Moreover, no stars in our sample with an apparent age more than ~10 Myr present a disk < 24 um wavelength. Our results display an array of disk characteristics (e.g., SED morphology, L_DISK\/L*, etc) for wTTs that bridge the gap between classical T Tauri stars and debris disk."}
{"text":"\nThis work examines the presence of norm and numerical peak holomorphic functions on Banach spaces. We show that in finite dimension the intersection of the set of all norm peak functions and all numerical peak functions is a dense $G_\\delta$ subset of $A_b(B_X:X)$. We also prove that if $X$ has the Radon-Nikod\\'ym property then all numerical strong peak functions form a dense subset of $A_b(B_X:X)$. For $X=L_p(\\mu)$ and $X=\\ell_1$, we demonstrate that this intersection is a dense $G_\\delta$ subset of $A_b(B_X:X)$. Furthermore, we explore the numerical radius of holomorphic functions and numerical index of subspaces of $A_b(B_X:X)$. We also study the numerical boundary of $A_b(B_X:X)$ and characterize the numerical peak function in $A_b(B_X:X$ when $X=\\ell_\\infty^n$, and provide some negative results on the denseness of numerical peak holomorphic functions."}
{"text":"\nIn recent analyses of the full- and partial-sky WMAP data, strong indications of large-angle anisotropies were found. If these are proven to be real, the implications for the Universe can be significant. To this end, the authors employed a directional indicator for the creation of a sky map of the anisotropies present in the WMAP maps. Results of this study indicated a statistically significant preferred direction in the full-sky map, and the same was found to hold true when the map was masked. However, some of the subtler anomalies in the former map were no longer present. These results suggest the presence of large-angle anisotropies in the CMB maps."}
{"text":"\nThis paper examines the variations in pulsation of Delta Scuti stars 7 Aql (HD 174532) and 8 Aql (HD 174589) -- a newly-discovered variable star -- which were observed during STEPHI XII campaign in 2003 June-July. As part of the campaign, 183 hours of high-precision photometry was captured with four-channel photometers at sites in three different continents during a 21-day period. Light curves and amplitude spectra were obtained following the standard practice of multi-channel photometry, while observations in various filters were also achieved and assessed. 99% confidence level revealed that 6 and 3 frequencies are connected to 7 Aql and 8 Aql respectively, and were in the ranges of 0.090 mHz - 0.300 mHz and 0.100 mHz - 0.145 mHz. Comparing the observed and theoretical frequencies implies that 7 Aql and 8 Aql might be oscillating with low order of radial mode alluding to Delta Scuti stars. Subsequent non-linear computations determined that expected excited modes of 8 Aql and 7 Aql respectively span from n=1 to n=3 and n =4 to n =7. Additionally, non-radial oscillations are also likely to exist in both stars."}
{"text":"\nThis article explores how systems of polynomial equations can be used to model and express a variety of combinatorial optimization problems. An important result of this paper is the construction of polynomial encodings for the problems of finding the longest cycle, the largest planar subgraph, the edge-chromatic number, and the largest k-colorable subgraph of a given graph. In addition, we demonstrate that the Hilbert Nullstellensatz can provide certificates of infeasibility for each problem, which implies that the minimum degree of the related certificate for \"hard\" problems must increase along an infinite sequence of problems. We present evidence of this by showing that the minimum degree of the Nullstellensatz certificate for the non-existence of a stable set with size greater than the graph's stability number is the stability number of the graph and that the certificate contains at least one term per stable set. In contrast, the certificate for the non-3-colorability of a graph was only of degree four."}
{"text":"  In this article, we investigate affine structures on a ringed space and schemes. We explore the behavior of affine structures on a space resulting from analytical spaces of algebraic schemes over number fields. Pseudogroups of affine transformations are utilized to define affine atlases on a space, and maximal atlas will determine an affine structure. Admissible affine structures can be recognized by the coincidence of a sheaf on the underlying space. We give necessary and sufficient conditions for two spaces to be homeomorphic and two schemes to be isomorphic using the affine structures as local data. The global properties of the space and the scheme are encoded and reflected through their respective affine structures."}
{"text":"\nThe advanced optical model is employed to analyze dynamically the simultaneous $\\chi^2$ for both elastic scattering and fusion cross section data for $^7$Li+$^{208}$Pb at near-Coulomb-barrier energies. A double folding potential is used as the bare potential and no normalization is needed to explain the experimental data. The decomposition of the polarization potential into direct reaction (DR) and fusion parts indicates that the fusion part is attractive while the DR part is repulsive, apart from energies beneath the Coulomb barrier. We compare the current study with CDCC calculations and an earlier optical model study using a double folding potential. Additionally, the current results are contrasted with the previous analysis on the $^6$Li+$^{208}$Pb system."}
{"text":"This paper examines the geometrical properties of probability distributions that maximize the $q$-R\\'enyi entropy.

Then we demonstrate how these calculations can be used to show how the parameter $q$ affects the statistical distinguishability of nearby points. Furthermore, we reveal the relationship between the classical metrics and the metrics used in the field of quantum information geometry."}
{"text":"\nResults from numerical simulations of star formation in the early universe,\nfocusing on gas of low metallicities, have provided evidence that the gas in\nthe central regions of protogalactic halos will undergo fragmentation. This\nfragmentation occurs if the gas carries sufficient angular momentum,\nresulting in a formation of a massive disk-like structure. At a critical\nmetallicity of 10^-5 solar masses, dust cooling becomes effective,\ntriggering a sharp drop in temperature at densities greater than 10^12\ncm^-3 causing vigorous fragmentation and the emergence of the first low-mass\nstellar cluster. Results from this study point towards a mass function of\nstars that is comparable to that of the very-low metallicity subgiant stars\nrecently discovered in the Milky Way galaxy, with the maximum mass falling\nbelow 1 Msun. Experiments conducted below the metallicity of 10^-6 solar\nmasses demonstrate that the gas undergoes partial isothermal collapse with a\npolytropic exponent of gamma ~ 1.06, resulting in few star formations of\nmasses in excess of several tens of solar masses."}
{"text":"  This paper presents an expansion of self-interacting random walks. This expansion yields formulae to compute the speed and variance of these walks, as well as a law of large numbers and central limit theorem with detailed error estimates. Each of these calculations is illustrated with specific models such as reinforced random walk, excited random walk, true (weakly) self-avoiding walk, loop-erased random walk, and annealed random walk in random environments. Assuming strong conditions on the expansion coefficients, we prove the validity of the expansion with its associated formulae under those conditions. We showcase models of excited random walk in high dimension with a small excitation parameter, reinforced random walk with drift and small reinforcement, and random walk in certain random environments with strong ellipticity. This paper includes full proofs to accompany our results."}
{"text":"\nIn this work, we investigate the phase behavior of a fluid with attractive and repulsive interparticle interactions, by assessing the effects of attraction and repulsion on the liquid-vapor transition. Our simulations and theoretical analysis reveal that the repulsion can supplant the liquid-vapor critical point, as well as parts of the associated transition line, by two first order transitions. Consequently, a vapor-liquid transition line can appear at a triple point. Our integral equation studies indicate that the Percus-Yevick approximation is capable of capturing the vapor-cluster transition, as well as describing the cluster fluid to a good degree of accuracy in comparison to simulation results."}
{"text":"\nThe aim of this article is to identify the optimal survey window for the 2MASS flux dipole in order to maximize its correlation with the CMB dipole. To do this, we study the effect of excluding galaxies brighter than a certain limiting magnitude K_s in the near-infrared K band. We find that the optimal value of K_min to achieve this is five, though this shifts to larger values if shot noise is included. We also derive a formula for shot noise, to be used in subsequent studies with 2MASS data. In addition, we use a statistical model to show that the misalignment angle between the two dipoles is consistent with the assumptions of our model. Lastly, we predict with a high degree of confidence that the misalignment will decrease when galaxies brighter than K_min = 5 are excluded. This prediction has been partially verified by previous studies."}
{"text":"\nWe propose an innovative method for analyzing homology with regards to coverings of topological spaces; namely, covering homology. This method is related to Bokstedt, Hsiang and Madsen's topological cyclic homology, and when used with a family of orientation preserving isogenies of the circle, yields the same results. We use a cofibration sequence coupled with a restriction map to study the covering homology. In addition, when the family is composed of isogenies of a torus, the concept of iterated topological Hochschild homology comes into play and the objective is to obtain an algebraic K-theory trace map. Our hope is that covering homology will be a useful tool in exploring J. Rognes' red shift conjecture."}
{"text":"An overview of the developments in the Random Field Ising Model in the past three decades is provided. Attention is then focused on the phase transition in the three-dimensional RFIM which is said to be related to the low temperature order-disorder transition at different levels of random field strength. Simple scaling arguments are used to explain this concept further. Additionally, a probabilistic approach and a modified mean-field approach which take into account the nearest-neighbour spin-spin correlations are studied in detail. Results show that in the absence of thermal fluctuation,the behaviour of the magnetization curve is history dependent. A hysteresis loop is observed from the comparison between the magnetization curve when the field strength is increasing and decreasing."}
{"text":"\nThe CERN Axion Solar Telescope (CAST) is an Axion detector that has been in operation since 2003, seeking to detect Axions produced in the sun via the Primakoff process.

This surpasses all prior experiments, as well as astrophysical limits based on energy-loss concept by nearly a magnitude.

{"text":"This article explores the phenomenon of information diffusion in social networks through a combination of experiments and theoretical models. Drawing from Viral Marketing campaigns involving over 31,000 individuals in eleven markets in Europe, we observe a high degree of variability in the way individuals receive and transmit information. Our findings show the prevalence of super-spreading events in the spread of information and a slowing down of the diffusion process over time. We also discover that an appropriate stochastic branching model can be used to accurately describe our findings and confirm the importance of heterogeneity. Our results are pertinent to other human-driven diffusion activities such as rumors, fads, innovations, and news, and can have considerable implications for organizations\u2019 management, communications, marketing, and electronic social communities."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate the potential of developing cooperation through the spatial Prisoner's Dilemma by introducing a reimbursement system. This is based on previous works by Nowak and May, offering a cost-benefit model option applicable to numerous biological studies. Through our research, we shed light on how offering a reward to cooperating players can foster the spread of cooperation even after the reward system is deactivated and offer further insight into the sustainability of this method. In this paper, we discuss the theoretical implications of one cooperator entering a population of defectors and support our findings with simulations involving only a small fraction of initial cooperators. The results of this study provide promising implications for establishing cooperation through a reward system and indicate that large, sustainable levels of cooperation can be attained. Finally, we discuss potential applications of the findings, as well as links to other mechanisms that aim to promote cooperative behaviour."}
{"text":"\nIn this article, we explore the potential of braneworld models with induced gravity to explain the observed phenomenon of dark matter in astrophysical and cosmological settings. By analyzing the 21 cm line from neutral hydrogen clouds in spiral galaxies, it is seen that their rotational velocities remain relatively constant at a value of v_c ~ 10^-3-10^-4 at the distances of the galactic halo. Accordingly, we develop a perturbative scheme for reconstructing the metric in the galactic halo, which, at distances greater than v_c \\ell, approximates the result from the Randall-Sundrum braneworld. To do this for a real spiral galaxy, \\ell must be about 2 Mpc. This implies the gravitational situation is approximately described by the Einstein equations with a Weyl fluid playing the role of dark matter. By considering a static and spherically symmetric problem, we derive a closed system of equations in the region near the gravitating body. Here, the Schwarzschild metric provides a valid approximation of these equations at distances  lesser than (r_g \\ell^2)^1\/3. This \\ell value is compliant with solar system tests. Furthermore, in cosmology, an low-density braneworld with \\ell of this magnitude can simulate the expansion properties of the high-density LCDM universe at later times. Combined observations of galaxy rotation curves and gravitational lensing may be sufficient to elucidate the influence of higher dimensional effects and dark matter."}
{"text":"The exploration of the possible supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking scale can be informed by B-physics observables (BPO) as well as electroweak precision data (EWPO). Here, we analyze recent measurements of such observables, including BR(b -> s gamma), BR(B_s -> mu^+ mu^-), BR(B_u -> tau nu_tau) and Delta M_{B_s}, along with those of M_W, sin^2 theta_eff, Gamma_Z, (g-2)_mu and M_h, in both the constrained minimal supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model (CMSSM) and the non-universal Higgs model (NUHM). Furthermore, we assume that the lightest supersymmetric particle is responsible for the cold dark matter density preferred by WMAP and other cosmological data. Our studies reveal a preference for a relatively low SUSY-breaking scale under the CMSSM and a slightly lower chi^2 value in studies of NUHM compatible with the cold dark matter constraint in M_A-tan_beta planes."}
{"text":"\nUsing Swift to detect distant Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) at redshifts >5, this paper investigates the possibility of forming GRBs in low-metallicity environments. Our model successfully fits both the observed BATSE and Swift GRB peak flux distributions and is supported by the number of z>2.5 detections in the two-year Swift data. In this model, the probability of detecting a GRB at z>5 is 10% for peak photon fluxes of 1 ph s^-1 cm^-2. We suggest that this probability can be used to identify high redshift GRBs by quickly gathering information from Swift and our model. Testing this on last year's Swift data, we identified six potential candidates, two of which were later confirmed to be at z>5. These six candidates show no low-redshift interlopers."}
{"text":"\nOur IFU observations of emission-line nebulae that encircle the central galaxy\nof cooler core clusters suggest that several different phenomena may be at work in their formation. Such nebulae can develop due to AGN and starburst-powered outflows, with the presence of a neighboring galaxy to provide disruption. We have also established that rotation of the same amplitude as the underlying molecular reservoir might cause the excitation or formation of one of the nebulae, implying lack of disturbance of the central galaxy. The nebulae also demonstrate bulk flows and velocity shears up to several hundred km\/s, and are likely constantly being reshaped and reformed due to their unsteady configurational states. Moreover, our results suggest that the varying ionization states of gas in the nebulae, particularly their [NII]\/H_alpha ratios, are likely caused by a combination of UV from massive, young stars, in conjunction with an underlying heating source."}
{"text":"This article examines Berkovich spaces with respect to commutative algebra and local rings. It is demonstrated that these rings are excellent and we introduce and investigate the concept of analytically separable extensions, which includes finite separable extensions as well as complete extensions of perfect fields. Properties such as Rm, Sm, Gorenstein, Cohen-Macaulay, and Complete Intersection are discussed, alongside a GAGA principle applied to finitely generated schemes over an affinoid algebra. Additionally, the global geometric notions of irreducible components of an analytic space and its normalization are explored, along with their connections to base change in terms of connectedness and irreducibility. In summary, the results obtained demonstrate that Berkovich spaces are indeed excellent."}
{"text":"\nThis paper examines the afterglow of Swift GRB 050802, which features an X-ray lightcurve break at 5000s and an optical counterpart decaying as a single power-law. The X-ray observations began 286s after the trigger, and the optical data were obtained throughout a 170-650 nm wavelength range. It was found that the X-ray lightcurve consists of three power-law segments, while the optical lightcurve decays as a single power-law. Modeling the relation between optical and X-ray emissions revealed that these two cannot be produced by the same underlying component. Therefore, a two-component jet model was provided to explain the X-ray break at 5000s which is most likely due to a jet break in the narrower component. This case is believed to be helpful in interpretation of the rarely observed achromatic jet breaks regarding Swift GRBs."}
{"text":"\nIn this article, we explore the propagation of sound and inertial waves in a rotating superfluid neutron star core, considering the mutual friction force generated by vortices. By emphasizing the effects of chemical coupling and entrainment, we explore the damping of sound waves along the direction of the vortex array, showing that it is not dampened, but inertial waves are. Additionally, vortex tension due to local curvature can induce a small correction in the wave frequency. When accounting for relative linear flow along the rotation axis, we uncover a dynamical instability induced by the mutual friction coupling present in inertial waves. The implications of this instability for the physics of neutron stars are discussed."}
{"text":"\nUsing a given triangulation for a closed, orientable, irreducible, atoroidal 3-manifold, we define an encoding of each normal, oriented surface using non-negative integer weights and use this to construct a convex polytope in the relevant space of weights which maps to the unit-ball of the Thurston norm via a linear homology map. This has several applications, including a linear-time algorithm to compute the Thurston norm and intricate upper-bounds on the number of vertices of the polytope in terms of the number of simplices. Moreover, one can efficiently decide if a 3-manifold stems from a fibred face of the polytope in order to determine if the 3-manifold is capable of fibreing over the circle."}
{"text":"\nThis investigation examines the capability of estimating a deterministic field given unreliable, noisily-quantized, binary observations obtained from randomly deployed sensors. The primary focus is on strict conditions which make it impossible to know the noise distribution and guarantee the accuracy of the sensing precision and reliability. Real-world applications may involve deploying a wide array of economical, crudely produced sensors in environments with minimal to no data on the surrounding noise. This paper presents a simple way to reconstruct the entire data field from the aforementioned conditions. Among the details discussed are the strong convergence parameters of the estimator when the number of sensors is large, and integrated MSE decay rates for certain function classes. Additionally, for two of these classes, the decay rates are found to be optimally optimal with respect to known noise and infinite accuracy sensing."}
{"text":"\nIn this work, we present a strategy for controlling Liesegang patterns generated by precipitation processes through the use of guiding fields. This involves utilizing a non-autonomous Cahn-Hilliard equation to model the phase-separation, wherein the spinodal is determined by the shape of the guiding field. Consequently, the velocity of the instability front that separates the stable and unstable regions of the system is modulated. Since the wavelength of the pattern is largely determined by this velocity, it can be used to control the distance between successive precipitation bands. Our numerical studies of a 1D system with diffusive guiding field can be accurately described by linear stability analysis, which provides an expression for the velocity -- local-wavelength relationship. From this perspective, these results propose that revert patterns can be generated via the implementation of diffusive guiding fields."}
{"text":"We investigate the irreducible forms of variations in the gravitational action terms due to the 17 curvature invariants of sixth order derivatives in the metric tensor, which are components of the heat-kernel or Gilkey-DeWitt coefficient $a_3$. We evaluate the approximated stress-energy tensors in four dimensions generated by a massive scalar field and in higher dimensions, the infinite counterterms that are sixth order derivatives in the metric tensors, as well as the cubic Lovelock action gravitational contributions. An appendix lists the geometric relations we have employed which are of wider use for two-loop quantum gravity in four dimensions, and one-loop quantum gravity in higher dimensions. We have additionally determined the approximated stress-energy tensors developed from a massive spinor field, and a massive vector field in a four dimensional background."}
{"text":"\nGiven two positive integers a and b, we characterize, analyze, and study the properties of a culminating path, which is a path of Z^2 starting from (0,0) consisting of steps (1,a) and (1,-b), staying above the x-axis and ending at the highest ordinate it ever reaches. The seminal work of this field originated in bioinformatics and the study of similarity search algorithms, and is also connected to certain models of Lorentzian gravity in theoretical physics. We provide an assessment of the language on a two letter alphabet which naturally encodes culminating paths and show that it is not context-free. Additionally, the step-by-step approach combined with the kernel method allows us to derive a closed-form expression for the generating function of culminating paths ending at a (generic) height k. This enables us to further gather its asymptotic behaviour when a=b, while in the cases when a>b and a<b, we determine the exponential growth of the number of culminating paths, respectively. Finally, we discuss and compare the various methods for uniform random generation of culminating paths. The rejection approach combined with a symmetry argument presents a linear algorithm with no precomputation stage or non-linear storage necessary when a>= b, while in the case a<b the superior algorithm is less clear. Furthermore, the more elementary recursive approach yields a linear algorithm after a precomputation phase utilizing O(n^3) arithmetic operations. Nevertheless, some alternatives to this approach may be more efficient in practice."}
{"text":"\nIn this article, we investigate the possibility of higher order antibunching in various intermediate states. We focus on the effects of control parameters on the depth of nonclassicality in these states, as well as its existence in various limits. We demonstrate that various nonlinear optical processes can produce higher order antibunching, rather than the shadowed negative binomial state which had previously been reported. Through our observations, we aim to establish higher order subpoissonian photon statistics as a pervasive effect in intermediate states and show that it can be tuned by controlling various physical parameters."}
{"text":"This study investigates the thermal effects on nuclear symmetry energy for different baryon density values using a momentum-dependent effective interaction. The symmetry energy, mean field potential, proton fraction and electron chemical potential are estimated at various temperatures. Additionally, an equation of state of $\\beta$-stable nuclear matter is constructed, providing essential information for the evaluation of neutron star properties. The results of this work provide valuable insight into the dynamical evolution of massive stars, presupernova explosions and neutron stars."}
{"text":"This paper surveys the consequences of strong field effects on binary systems when using Einstein-aether theory. By employing an effective approach, nonstandard interactions between the point particles situated near neutron stars pulsars are calculated and incorporated. Post-Newtonian equations of motion and radiation damping rates are then formulated, whilst the value of the sensitivities for a chosen fluid source are determined. The results suggest that unless the coupling constants are over 0.01, one more condition has to be imposed on the theory that conforms to those of general relativity, allowing the small couplings to pass certain observational tests. However, any theories with large couplings must be evaluated further before conclusions can be drawn."}
{"text":"This article presents an investigation of the dimensions of subspaces that possess states with bounded Schmidt rank. We study the largest dimension of a subspace made up of states with Schmidt rank at least equal to r, and with local dimensions dA and dB, and the maximum value of the dimension of a subspace with all states having a Schmidt rank that no greater than r. This is a progress in understanding the Hayden et al. results, which show that high dimensional subspaces of certain bi-partite systems are highly entangled, and also reflects the Parthasarathy results that concern completely entangled subspaces and their relationships to the development of unextendible product bases. We extend the improved random subspace techniques to reach this better understanding."}
{"text":"\nThis paper reveals the shared origin of linear and nonlinear chiral multiplets in N=4 mechanics with the (2,4,2) off-shell content. By gauging two distinct two-parameter isometries of the (4,4,0) multiplet action--one abelian, the other non-abelian--we uncover disguises of the same (unique) nonlinear chiral multiplet. This lends support to the idea that no other nonlinear N=4 chiral multiplets exist. We employ the language of N=4, d=1 harmonic superspace, using simultaneously the \\lambda and \\tau gauge frames, with the interconnections between them playing a vital role. As it turns out, it is the underlying N=4 harmonic analyticity that supplies both linear and nonlinear chirality constraints in the \\tau gauge, in spite of its non-manifest structure. Our approach additionally touches upon the possible sigma model type actions featuring restricted potential forms, followed by the discussion of their associated Fayet-Iliopoulos terms."}
{"text":"\nIn this work, we investigate the efficacy of existing H-deficient post-AGB tracks, with special focus on their predictive power regarding the past evolution of their progenitor stars. Inspired by the findings of Werner & Herwig (2006) regarding the likely existence of discrepancies between spectroscopic and asteroseismological mass determinations, we ran full evolutionary models with variable extramixing (overshooting) efficiencies and lifetimes on the TP-AGB and altered opacities and equations of state. Comparisons were then made to other available H-deficient post-AGB tracks from the literature. Contrary to our anticipations, our study suggested that prior evolution does not have a major role in defining these tracks. Additionally, only an increase of about 50% in the intershell opacities at high effective temperatures might significantly influence the tracks to the degree of reconciling spectroscopic and asteroseismological mass determinations. Thus, our results keep the post-AGB tracks previously reported by Miller Bertolami & Althaus (2006) relatively robust and suitable for spectroscopic mass determinations, barring substantial discrepancies in the intershell opacities. In turn, our findings direct us to investigate the potential systematic issues present in current asteroseismological mass determination techniques."}

{"text":"This article examines the problem of decentralized statistical inference, in which individual sensors must estimate an arbitrary quantile of an unknown distribution while exchanging a limited number of bits. A centralized approach approach, which yields the best possible mean-squared error decaying as $\\order(1\/[n m])$, supposing that each of $\\nodenum$ sensors receive $n$ observations, is analyzed. To compare this performance, two decentralized protocols are developed. The first protocol uses $k = \\log(\\nodenum)$ bits of feedback, and is strongly consistent and attains the same asymptotic mean-squared error as the centralized optimum. The second protocol employs only one bit ($k=1$) of feedback. Depending upon the step size, it may achieve an asymptotic mean-squared error order of $\\order[1\/(n \\sqrt{m})]$ or the same $\\order(1\/[n m])$ decay in MSE as the optimal centralized protocol. Both theoretical results and simulations are presented to demonstrate the tradeoffs between the protocols."}
{"text":"\nThis paper proposes an alternative method to analyze the asymptotic growth of sequences obtained from the multisum of hypergeometric terms. We conjecture (and prove in some cases) that the solution set of a special form of polynomial equations, reminiscent of the Bethe ansatz, is a finite set that contains the singularities of the associated generating series. This finite set is also identified with the set of critical values of a potential function, as well as with the evaluation of elements of an additive $K$-theory group by a regulator function. Several examples are presented to illustrate our results."}
{"text":"\nWe use a sample of X-ray selected galaxy clusters at redshift $0.2\\le z\\le 0.6$ to explore and quantify the statistical characteristics of the Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG) population. Our approach involves employing a specific set of criteria for determining LRGs' membership within clusters and measuring their redshifts photometrically. The broad aim of this study is to gain insights into the dark matter distribution and the evolution of massive galaxies in cluster environments.\n\nOur discourse brings to light several notable conclusions. Firstly, the analysis of LRGs' halo occupation distribution reveals a strong connection between the galaxy and the dark matter; this correlation follows the power law formula $N(M) = k\\times (M\/10^{14})^{a}$, where $a = 0.620 \\pm 0.105$ and $k = 1.425 \\pm 0.285$. Secondly, Poisson's distribution is an accurately fitting model for both the halo occupation $N(M)$ and satellite occupation $N-1(M)$ of the LRGs. Finally, the NFW profile-based radial profile analysis fetches the LRGs a concentration value of $17.5^{+7.1}_{-4.3}$ including the brightest ones (BLRGs), and $6.0^{+3.2}_{-1.9}$ excluding them.\n\nThis investigation provides a good overview of the LRG population in clusters at $0.2\\le z\\le 0.6$, exploring the relation between galaxies and dark matter distributions as well as resulting implications for the evolution of massive galaxies in clusters."}
{"text":"This article explores the possibilty of inflationary de Sitter solutions in a superstring compactification, defined by N=1 supersymmetry and spontaneously broken by either geometrical fluxes, branes, or else. A specific set of moduli-fields are required in this instance, one of which being a universal 'no-scale-modulus' defining the supersymmetry breaking scale. During the time evolution, constants are set by radiative and temperature corrections, resulting in either a first or second order phase transition. In the first case, an instantonic Euclidean solution bridges inflationary evolution to a cosmological branch of Big Bang followed by Big Crunch. The second case smoothly intersects the Big Bang and inflationary phases."}
{"text":"In this study, we reveal the connection between two seemingly unrelated phenomena - the appearance of two-level systems in glasses and the Boson peak in the reduced density of low-frequency vibrational states (g(w)\/w^2). We propose that a common cause of these phenomena is the vibrational instability of weakly interacting harmonic modes below some frequency w_c << w_0 (of the order of the Debye frequency). This instability, driven by anharmonicity, gives rise to a new, universal spectrum of harmonic vibrations with a Boson peak feature and a wide range of double-well potentials with different barrier heights. We also show the dependence of the important measure C (of the number of active two-level systems per ten million oscillators) on the interaction strength I, finding that it is significantly smaller (C ~ 10^{-4}) than expected. In addition, our unified approach enables us to connect the density of tunneling states to the density of vibrational states at the Boson peak frequency."}
{"text":"\nIn recent years, radial velocity surveys have suggested a significant proportion of solar-type stars host Jupiter-sized planets within 0.1 AU from the star. This corresponds to a overall distribution of these planets with orbital periods of 3-4 days, as seen in Figure 1. It is believed these planets began on a much larger orbit around the star and then migrated inward to their observed location. This study investigates a possible explanation of this phenomenon: the Kozai mechanism. This process involves the Kozai torque between the planet and the binary star, driving down the minimum seperation until it is halted by circularization caused by tidal friction. In this scenario, roughly 2.5% of planets with initial semimajor axis of 5 AU will migrate to 0.1 AU of their parent star, potentially making Kozai migration account for as much as 10% of the observed hot Jupiters in binary star systems."}
{"text":"\nIn this study, 3D simulations of supersonic Euler turbulence are used to explore the physics of a highly compressible cascade. The numerical experiments are conducted with an isothermal equation of state and an rms Mach number of 6 that reveal significant deviations from the Kolmogorov's incompressible K41 theory. An extended K41 model is proposed that considers the mixture of velocity and density statistics while preserving the K41 scaling of the density-weighted velocity, v=rho^{1\/3}u. The extension is demonstrated to be invariant with respect to varying the Mach number, with the power spectrum of 'v' showing a slope of -1.69, whilst the third-order structure function of 'v' displays linear scaling with separation. The mass dimension of the density in the inertial subrange is also evaluated to D_m=2.4, which is similar to the fractal dimension of molecular clouds, and agrees with the cascade phenomenology."}
{"text":"\nWe present an approach to reducing the resolution of WZNW models on general type I\nsupergroups to those defined on the bosonic component. This includes GL(M|N), PSL(N|N), various Poincare supergroups, and the OSP(2|2N) series. Making use of a Feigin-Fuchs type representation, we employ a free fermion construction of the minisuperspace Laplacian to establish a non-diagonalizable spectrum. Moving to the full WZNW model, the associated field theory is studied according to its modular invariance, and the computation of correlation functions. Our results create a geometric perspective that extends to non-geometric models, such as the W(p) triplet."}

{"text":"\nWe investigate if the principles of equilibrium statistical mechanics can be used to model time independent, non-dissipative systems that are out of thermodynamic equilibrium and nonergodic. We propose that the phase space can be divided into locally ergodic sections and suggest that the relative probabilities of different microstates are determined by Boltzmann probabilities within said sections. Unlike similar approaches commonly applied to transitions in glassy systems, we do not assume any prior knowledge of the domain-domain population distribution. Further, we assume that the domains remain consistent given minor variations in thermodynamic state variables, thus deriving various fluctuation equations and validating them with molecular dynamics simulations. We also derive Transient Fluctuation Relations concerning fluctuations caused by abrupt changes in system pressure or temperature that agree with the simulation results. The Transient Fluctuation Relations reinforce the assumptions used in our statistical mechanics approach as long as the domains are internally Boltzmann populated and remain stable."}
{"text":"This paper presents a method to incorporate metal cooling into numerical simulations of cosmic structure formation. Leveraging the sophisticated chemical network of the photoionization software Cloudy, cooling rates are generated across a temperature range of 10 K to 10^8 K and up to a hydrogen number density of 10^12 cm^-3. When implementing these rates in the adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) hydrodynamic\/N-body code Enzo, the authors investigate physical conditions that led to the transition from Population III to Population II star formation. Results show that including metals up to a certain atomic number (Zn) increases the rate of radiative cooling and can potentially lead to fragmentation and the formation of low-mass stars from regions of certain density and temperature. In addition, up to 40% of the cooling can come from fine-structure emission by S when solar abundance patterns are present. The CMB inhibits efficient cooling at high redshifts, making fragmentation more difficult in doubly unstable regions than at lower redshifts."}
{"text":"\nThis paper outlines the GR2 and GR3 data releases of the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) which have seen improvements in the pipeline calibration of the Far Ultraviolet (FUV) and Near Ultraviolet (NUV) bands.

Additionally, the mission has seen a steady 1% FUV and 6% NUV drift over its run. As the GALEX mission continues into the extended phase, this paper outlines the calibration issues that users may encounter, with the hopes of further improvements as the instrument is kept healthy and guest investigations are enabled."}

This research extends previous work by examining the conditions necessary to obtain FQH states with bosons on a lattice under the effects of both an effective magnetic field and finite onsite interaction.

{"text":"\nIn this article, we look at the effect of rotational forcing on global smooth solutions of the two-dimensional shallow-water and compressible Euler equations that lack pressure. A prior investigation done by H. Liu and E. Tadmor in 2004 found that these equations admit long-term consistent solutions for a variety of sub-critical initial conditions. We now prove that when rotational forces surpass pressure, this leads to an extension of the duration of continuous, smooth solutions. This holds true when the ratio of the pressure gradient to the dominant rotational forces, measured by the inverse squared Froude number and inverse Rossby number respectively, is much smaller than one. Further analysis of the analysis reveals an approximate periodic solution within this small d-regime, which allows the exact smooth solutions to endure for a time period in excess of a day. This aligns with the close-to periodic dynamics seen in the aftermath of oceanic storms, called near inertial oscillations (NIOS)."}

{"text":"\nIn this paper, we propose a new model to explain the low luminosity characteristics of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). In this model, energy is extracted from the ions in the disk due to collisions between electrons and ions, leading to a disk of gas that is cooler than the traditional picture. In addition to this, the radial disk structure is modified by a magnetic torque, including the relativistic effects of a maximally spinning black hole, which drives the jet and is primarily responsible for angular momentum transport. We test our model by exploring a well-known LLAGN, M87 and calculate the combined disk-jet sky-state broadband spectrum, with results that agree with observed spectra. Moreover, further deduction with respect to the Eddington rate and total jet power, again confirms that M87 could be accreting gas at a rate of 10^{-3} solar masses per year, which is six orders of magnitude below the Eddington rate."}
{"text":"\nIn this study, we demonstrate the use of the Cavity Bifurcation Amplifier (CBA) for measuring the decoherence of a quantronium qubit. Our CBA, which consists of a Josephson junction embedded in a microwave on-chip resonator, has two metastable states - each state depending on the state of the quantronium qubit coupled to the CBA's junction. Through experiments performed at a MHz repetition rate, we find that the coherence is limited by 1\/f gate charge noise when the qubit is biased at the 'sweet spot'. We highlight the potential of this architecture for scalability in quantum computing, as the readouts could be multiplexed on a multi-resonator chip."}
{"text":"\nBy carrying out a high-resolution (FWHM~0.5'') Chandra HRC-I observation that was 12 ks long, we observed the starburst galaxy IC342 and identified 23 X-ray sources in a 30' x 30' region within its centre. This X-ray imaging revealed that the historically noted Ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX) X3 near the galactic nucleus was decomposed into two distinct sources, which we named C12 and C13. Source C12, whose luminosity was observed to be (6.66\\pm0.45) x 10^{38}ergs^-1, was seen to be spatially extended with a size of about 82 pc x 127 pc. Analysis of astrometrically corrected optical Hubble Space Telescope and radio Very Large Array images demonstrated that this source was close to the nucleus, with C13 (5.1\\pm1.4) x 10^{37}ergs^-1 was located 6.51'' away, at a position angle of 240 degree. Comparison of X-ray data with the HST H alpha image also showed star formation occurring in the central region, which was where star clusters were observed. Our findings suggested that the observed X-ray luminosity can be explained by starburst, although we did not have enough evidence to firmly determine whether the presence of active galactic nucleus in IC342 can be confirmed."}
{"text":"This study applies an atomistic pseudopotential approach to analyze the interband, intraband and excited-state direct photon absorptive properties of Si and Ge nanocrystals located within a wide band-gap lattice. NCs of various sizes, from small clusters to those containing several thousand atoms, were studied. The results revealed oscillations in the highest occupied molecular orbital for both Si and Ge NCs and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital for Si NCs with the size of the NCs. Furthermore, surface polarization effects were seen to significantly reduce the absorption when included. Further evidence of this was found in the comparison of the predicted absorption spectra with their experimental counterparts. It was concluded that intraconduction and intravalence band absorption coefficients for the wavelength range from far-infrared to visible are valuable for infrared photodetection prospects of these NC arrays. Lastly, the absorption spectra from excited states shown strong absorption windows in the case of holes and a broad spectrum in the case of electrons that can help explain gain in this type of structure."}

{"text":"\nConfirming a tremendous filamentary structure extending over 20 million light-years located near the super rich cluster CL0016+1609 at a redshift of 0.55, our spectroscopic follow-up observations with FOCAS on Subaru provide evidence that the structure is physically connected and likely bound to the main cluster. Taking advantage of this unique feature, we examine the variation of galaxy properties according to environment - field, group, and cluster. Investigating star formation histories of galaxies through composite spectra, we find that galaxies in groups at z~0.8 and field galaxies at z~0.5 exhibit Hd absorption lines that point to a truncation of star formation occurring within a relatively short time period. We suggest this is due to a galaxy-galaxy interaction that ultimately leads to the build-up of the colour-magnitude relation since z~1."}
{"text":"\nWe have conducted extensive spectroscopic studies of 18 M6.5-T8 ultracool dwarfs, which are located within 20 parsecs (pc) of the Sun, to gain insight into their kinematic behavior. We have utilized radial velocity measurements and NIRSPEC data obtained with the Keck II telescope in order to determine their UVW motions and to analyze the presence of planetary-mass companions around one of the T-type stars in our sample. We have found that the two-dimensional UVW velocities of the L and T dwarfs largely match those of the G to M stars distributed in the same spatial volume. However, the mean Galactic and tangential velocities of the L and T dwarfs appear to be slightly lower than those of the G-M bright stars. Furthermore, the velocity dispersions of the L- and T-type ultracool dwarfs are similarly narrow to those derived for F stars, indicating that these brown dwarfs have likely ages in the range of 0.5-4 Gyr. Finally, we have detected that the fraction of these ultracool dwarfs belonging to the Hyades moving group is close to 40%, a significantly higher proportion compared to the 10-12% found for the earlier-type stellar representatives present in the same region."}

{"text":"\nAsteroseismology is a powerful tool for understanding the internal structures of stars by measuring the oscillations caused by convection.

Using a time series of 1201 radial velocity measurements, taken over 14 nights at Siding Spring Observatory in Australia and ESO La Silla Observatory in Chile, we identified 13 individual oscillations with amplitudes ranging from 53 to 173 cm\/s. The regularity of the oscillations was quickly evident, with a large and small spacing of 25.14 +- 0.09 uHz and 2.96 +- 0.22 uHz at 330 uHz. Additionally, the mode damping time was calculated to be about 16 days, with a 1-sigma range of between 9 and 50 days, significantly higher than that of other stars such as the Sun or alpha Cen."}
{"text":"\nWe present a new method of continuous trapping of $^{1}$S$_{0}$ calcium atoms using optical dipole traps (ODTs) that is based on spatially selective optical pumping. We start with a source of moderately cold ($\\approx 300~\\mu$K) metastable $^{3}$P$_{2}$ atoms that have been produced through a magneto-optic trap (triplet-MOT). By directing a second laser beam of 532~nm to the ODT, another laser beam of 430~nm is used to transfer the $^{3}$P$_{2}$-atoms into the trap's capture zone, where they are transformed into the ODT's single state of confinement. To replenish the capture zone with $^{3}$P$_{2}$-atoms, the triplet-MOT keeps re-populating this capture zone to create a continuous stream of cold atoms that are trapped at a rate of $10^7$ s$^{-1}$. Since this loading method is restricted by its evaporation loss, 200~ms yields a capture of up to $5 \\times 10^5$ atoms with an initial radial temperature of 85~$\\mu$K. During an additional 50~ms of evaporation, a peak phase space of $6.8 \\times 10^{-5}$ and a radial temperature at near 40~$\\mu$K are observed. Furthermore, the same concept could be utilized to trap $^{3}$P$_{0}$-atoms."}
{"text":"\nThe redshift z=0.116 BL Lac, PKS 2155-304, is renowned for its VHE (>100 GeV) gamma-ray emission. Unprecedented activity was detected on the night of July 28th, 2006 (MJD 53944) as monitored by the H.E.S.S. imaging atmospheric-Cherenkov telescopes in Namibia. During the extreme gamma-ray outburst, a flux of I(>200 GeV) = (1.72$\\pm$$0.05_{\\rm stat}$$\\pm$$0.34_{\\rm syst}$) $\\times$ 10$^{-9}$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ was measured which was approximately seven times that of the flux observed from the Crab Nebula. Variability was observed with peak fluxes predominantly rising for 1 minute intervals, a Fourier power spectrum showing a manifestation of up to 600 seconds and bursts ranging from 200 seconds. Surprisingly, no strong indications of spectral variability were detected throughout the data. These remarkable results necessitate Doppler factors greater than 100 if the emission region were to be comparable to the Schwarzschild radius of a ~10$^9 M_\\odot$ black hole."}
{"text":"\nIn this paper we use a method applied by Denef and Loeser to analyze the stringy E-function of a hypersurface via the Hodge zeta function. We employ the inversion of adjunction technique and an algorithm of Denef and Hoornaert, utilized by Artal, Cassou-Nogues, Luengo and Melle, to calculate the motivic zeta function and stringy E-function from a given non-degenerate Newton polyhedron. This approach allows us to determine stringy E-function contributions from Brieskorn singularities. It serves to deduce that the stringy Hodge numbers of varieties with particular types of strictly canonical Brieskorn singularities are all non-negative. Moreover, by computing a six-dimensional example, we show that a result from a prior paper, implying non-negativity of stringy Hodge numbers in lower dimensions, is not true in higher dimensions."}
{"text":"\nThis study investigates how variations in mixtures of heavy element abundances affect stellar evolution models and thereby influence integrated light measurements of galaxies. Twelve sets of stellar evolution tracks and isochrones are created at a constant heavy element mass fraction Z, accounting for scaled-solar, alpha-enhanced, and individual element abundance enhancements. Variations between the scaled-solar and other cases are then examined in terms of their effects on the H-R diagram and main sequence lifetimes. This research is important for accurately interpreting the spectral indices of distant galaxies and for improving spectral synthesis models."}
{"text":"\nGALEX Ultra-violet (UV) galaxies have been examined to determine the most effective tool for identifying Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs) at z~1. These galaxies were divided into two types, the Red LBGs (RLBGs) with 24 micron emissions and Blue LBGs (BLBGs) without 24 micron emissions. The median SED of the RLBGs has similarities to that of a dusty starburst. Unlike local ULIRGs, they are UV bright. The median SED of BLBGs suggests they contain the same stellar population as the RLBGs yet contain a smaller amount of dust. The luminosity functions of z~1 LBGs and NUV-selected galaxies were found to be similar with equivalent luminosity densities. UV measurements corrected with the IRX-beta method provide a SFR_TOT for the dust and UV components found to be in agreement. However, BLBGs only contribute a third of the total LBG SFR whereas RLBGs contribute two thirds. Furthermore, only 11% of the total SFR found at z~1 is from LBGs; a decline in L_TIR to L_FUV from z~2 to 0 was discovered in UV-selected samples."}
{"text":"\nWe detect the high-excitation CO J=6-5 and J=4-3 lines in Mrk231, a prototypical Ultra Luminous Infrared Galaxy (ULIRG) and Seyfert 1 QSO in the local Universe. These detections, coupled with observations of CO J=3-2, HCN J=4-3 (presented here) and CO J=2-1, 1-0, 13CO J=2-1 and HCN J=1-0 (from literature) allow us to obtain a better insight into the properties of the molecular gas in this extreme starburst\/QSO. Analysis of the molecular lines reveals that the CO J=4-3 and J=6-5 transitions trace a different phase of the molecular gas from that pertaining to the lower CO transitions, with density and temperature of (1-3)x10^4 cm-3 and (40-70) K respectively. This phase is responsible for the luminous HCN emission, and contains most of the H2 gas mass. Lastly, the total CO line cooling from this compact dense phase is shown to be similar to that of the [CII] line at 158 micron, suggesting a very different thermal balance from the lower IR-luminosity galaxies. Furthermore, we compare the local molecular line excitation template to the distant starbursts with the aim of helping determine the detectability of CO and HCN transitions with upcoming cm and mm\/sub-mm arrays."}

{"text":"\nIn this second paper on the QUEST sample of Quasars (QSOs), we focus on their Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs). We supplement our data with observations in optical, NIR and FIR. We identify two categories of QSOs as \u201cweak FIR\u201d and \u201cstrong FIR\u201d and a third category of QSOs without FIR detections. We assume the far infrared (FIR) emission is primarily due to star-forming activity and are able to remove a starburst template from the mean SED to obtain an \u201cintrinsic\u201d SED for the AGNs. The resulting SEDs for all 3 groups show the same three distinct peaks, two silicate emission features and a 3mic bump. We interpret these as the signature of the hottest AGN dust. Additionally, drops beyond 20mic are observed, which we interpret as the signature of the minimum temperature (approximately 200K) dust. We analyze the merits of an alternative model where most of the FIR is due to AGN heating and discuss the correlations between luminosity at 5100A and two infrared starburst indicators: L(60mic) and L(PAH 7.7mic).  This can be used to measure the relative growth rates and lifetimes of the black hole and the new stars."}
{"text":"Through the use of X-ray magnetic circular dichroism, the magnetic properties at the surface of perovskite manganites have been subject to much study in recent years in order to better understand and utilize their capabilities in magnetoelectronic devices. To reduce the inaccuracies of these approximations, we present an alternate approach involving X-ray magnetic circular dichroism reflection. Our method relies on a computer code based in a 4X4 matrix formalism to analyze the data and reach realistic conclusions, specifically in revealing the presence of a narrow surface area, containing severely diminished magnetic properties, in La2\/3Ca1\/3MnO3 thin films. It is clear that having a thorough understanding of both surface roughness and interfaces is critical to correctly analyzing and interpreting results."}
{"text":"\nIn this paper, we examine the localization phenomena of hardcore bosons contained in optical lattices and exposed to a disordered potential generated by a frozen species. This system is associated with a random potential, showing algebraic correlations, which leads to the localization of single-particle states. We examine the time dynamics of this localizing process, with mobile bosons interacting with the randomness, no matter the initial state or strength of disorder. The emergence of stationary states with exponentionally reduced off-diagonal correlations and no quasi-condensation are observed.  Moreover, when the mobile bosons are initially contained in a strict enclosure and released into this disorder, their scattering is obstructed, and the stationary condition is strongly localized in space, underscoring Anderson localization.

{"text":"This article examines the modified least squares estimators of the slope and intercept in linear structural error-in-variables models with univariate observations. Central limit theorems are established, assuming the measurement errors have four moments and the explanatory variables are in the domain of attraction of the normal law. The CLT's are already in the forms of a Studentized and self-normalized distribution and provide a range of efficient, data-based approximate confidence intervals for the slope and intercept, free of unknown parameters of the joint distribution of the error and explanatory variables. As such, these CI's are an improvement on the related CLT's in the literature which depend on various, unknown, moments of the errors and the explanatory variables."}
{"text":"\nThe potential for millimetric observatories to explore the polarization signals generated by highly ionized intra-cluster media (ICM) necessitates a closer examination of the characteristics of such signals. In particular, this work studies the impact of bulk ICM motions, called the kpSZ signal, on the polarization effect, which has an amplitude that is proportional to the optical depths and squared tangential velocity. To analyze this, two sets of high-resolution hydrodynamical N-body simulations were used to generate realistic kpSZ maps. The first set included 17 objects with non-radiative hydrodynamics while the second set included 9 objects with four differently-implemented physical processes. The results highlighted that the kpSZ signal is highly sensitive to the dynamics of galaxy clusters, and major mergers can amplify the signal an order of magnitude amounting up to 100 nuK. It was found that simplicistic models with spherical rigid bodies do not necessarily provide accurate estimates and the dependence on the physics of the baryonic component was only observed within the inner regions of clusters."}
{"text":"\nThe research into isolated neutron star 1E 1207.4-5209 has revealed wide absorption lines within its spectrum taken by both XMM-Newton and Chandra X-ray satellites, with the principal frequency centered at 0.7 keV and its harmonics at 1.4, 2.1 and possibly 2.8 keV. This resonant proton cyclotron scattering leads to a magnetic field of two orders of magnitude larger than the perpendicular component of the surface dipole magnetic field (B). Simultaneously, the age of the supernova remnant (SNR) G296.5+10.0 that is associated with 1E 1207.4-5209 is two orders of magnitude smaller than the characteristic age ($\\tau$=P\/2\\.{P}) of the neutron star. These discrepancies can be explained through the B-decay model, with the characteristic decay time being several thousand years - three orders of magnitude smaller than the characteristic decay time of radio pulsars. This faster exponential decay explains the lack of detection of radio emission from DRQNSs and the lack of point sources and pulsar wind nebulae in most of the observed SNRs. The distinctive characteristics of magnetic fields, equation of states and masses of these isolated neutron stars have to be taken into account in order to understand the variances in their decay times."}

This includes a multiple blackbody for the soft emission and a cut-off power law model for the hard component. The data has contributed to a new classification for KS 1741-293, confirming its identity as a hard-tailed X-ray burster."}
{"text":"\nThis study looks into the impact of saturation effects on the part of the absorption and fluorescence spectra of atomic vapor confined in an Extremely Thin Cell, measuring fewer than 1 $\\mu$m in thickness. Focus is placed upon the $D_{2}$ line of cesium with a wavelength of 852 nm, predominantly for when the cell is in two situations: $L = \\lambda \/2$ and $L = \\lambda$ (the latter having a greater dependence on the effect of Dicke narrowing). With intensities increasing, the Dicke-narrowed absorption profile is observed to broaden and get tamer for $L = \\lambda \/2$; however, the profile for $L = \\lambda$ has sub-Doppler dips of lower absorption at the center of the line. Nonetheless, when the light fluoresces at $L = \\lambda$, its saturation leads to dives with a smaller size of the components. Both theoretical models and numerical calculations relying on a two-level system, considering both the open and closed mechanisms, are used to back up the findings."}
{"text":"\nWe explore a new dynamical mean-field theory (B-DMFT), which offers a comprehensive, thermodynamically sound approach to understanding the behaviour of interacting bosons on a lattice. The B-DMFT is exact in high-dimensional lattices, and gives a precise description of both normal and condensed boson phases. It increases the accuracy of existing mean-field theories by accounting for dynamic coupling effects and reproducing known limits of parameter space, such as the Beliaev-Popov and Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov approximations. Its self-consistency equations represent a single impurity, connected to two reference systems for condensed and normal boson states. Beyond its theoretical advantages, the B-DMFT has practical applications, such as allowing us to analytically solve a model of interacting bosons. We show that local correlations can be used to enhance the density of condensate atoms and Bose-Einstein condensation transition temperature. This could be used to engineer and manipulate BECs of bosons in optical lattice systems."}

{"text":"\nThis review studies how the SPDC phase-matching's frequency-angular lineshape influences the generation of maximally-entangled states, using two regular entanglement-creation methods based on type-II spontaneous parametric down-conversion and a two-crystal type-I SPDC. Our analysis leads us to the conclusion that different Bell states appear at the peak and at ~half-maximum intensities in the SPDC line profile. We provide experimental evidence that these proposed states can be accessed using either frequency, angle or both for selection. This was established through a series of experiments with the two mentioned entanglement-creation processes and two types of measurements: angular- and frequency- based."}
{"text":"This paper investigates the potential of using 21-cm emissions from neutral hydrogen during and before the epoch of cosmic reionisation to reconstruct the projected mass distribution of foreground material, both light and dark, via gravitational lensing. Using the Millennium Simulation, large-area maps of the lensing convergence with realistic noise, resolution, and redshift-weighting achievable with a variety of idealised observation programmes are simulated. Results suggest that the signal-to-noise of 21-cm lens maps can be larger than those of maps made with galaxy lensing. Additionally, if the irreducible noise limit can be achieved with a large enough telescope, a high-fidelity image of the true matter distribution can be obtained, making it possible to view individual galaxies' dark matter halos and gain insight into the relative distributions of mass and light. Finally, mass imaging near the resolution limit of the core array of the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) is possible."}
{"text":"\nThis study examines the relationship between dark matter halo mass and its density profile at the time of virialization, based on simulations by Ricotti (2003). Analysis of data generated by both Gadget2 and higher resolution runs leads to confirmation of Ricotti's hypothesis that, at the time of virialization, a universal constant concentration of halos can be correlated with their mass. This result is consistent with other papers that use split power law parameterization to fit the density profiles, which reveals an alpha-concentration degeneracy that suggests a universal shape of the halo with specific alpha values (1 or 1.5) and concentrations that are dependent on its mass. Additionally, a non-parameterized technique is employed to show that the density profiles of dwarf galaxies at z ~ 10 generally have a log slope softer than 0.5 within the central 5% of the virial radius."}

{"text":"We present the results of a first principles density functional investigation of magnetism in nanographenes (also known as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, or PAHs). Our analysis indicates the emergence of antiferromagnetic (AFM) behavior as the size of the PAH reaches a certain threshold. The same origin of AFM behavior that occurs in infinitely long zigzag-edged graphene nanoribbons is observed in these PAHs. The minimal PAH that possesses this AFM ground state is identified. An investigation of the energy ordering between FM, AFM, and nonmagnetic (NM) phases as the zigzag-edges of these PAHs increase in length show they approach the behavior of an infinitely long ribbon. As a result, these PAHs offer potential targets for chemical synthesis of nanograpenenes that can display magnetic properties. Additionally, this study offers evidence that magnetism observed in activated carbon fibers originates from the zigzag edges of nanographenes."}
{"text":"This paper explores how spherical accretion works in the early Universe, prior to the formation of the first stars and galaxies. It considers the impact of CMB photons, Hubble expansion, and dark matter on the gas equations of motion. Solutions for the sonic radius and fitting formulas for the accretion rate are derived, taking into account whether the object being accreted from is a point mass or a dark matter halo. Parameters such as the mass of the accreting object are accounted for. This study also compares steady Bondi solutions to cold cosmological infall, suggesting the latter for objects with high enough mass."}
{"text":"\nRecent data collected by SWIFT and subsequent analysis has greatly increased our knowledge of X-ray emission from long-duration gamma ray bursts (GRBs) and X-ray flashes (XRFs). This article explains how the cannonball model of GRBs and XRFs previously proposed, based on the physics of inverse Compton scattering and synchrotron radiation, applied well to re-analyzed X-ray observations. The predictions of the model - such as the duration, flux and peak-times of gamma-ray peaks, X-ray flares and optical humps - have been accurately realized. Also discussed is the ability of the model to correctly describe the smooth or bumpy fast decays of the X-ray light curve, the canonical X-ray plateau, and the gradual steepening of the afterglow which ultimately reaches a power-law decay, both chromatically and achromatically."}
{"text":"\nWe examine optical spectroscopy from EX Hya during its 1991 eruption, in which the white dwarf emits intense light that is seen to heavily illuminate the front face of the secondary star. The outburst comes with a sharp drop in the light curve from 0.1 to 0.6 in the binary and spin phases, which is caused by the overflow of material in the HeII spectrum and the blocking of the Hg and Hb emissions because of strong irradiation of both the disc and its inner regions. Our data also reveals that stuff is speeding along field lines close to the white dwarf faster than they did in quiescence (up to ~1500 km\/s). Further, our observations demonstrate that material is collecting near the disc's outer edge and rotating in sync with the accretion curtain, which is responsible for the dip in the light curve seen in the decline. This adds to the evidence of a protracted accretion curtain and hints at the Spruit & Taam mechanism being responsible for the outbursts of EX Hya, where the accumulation and release of matter away from the magnetosphere leads to irradiation of the secondary star due to accretion-emitted radiation."}

{"text":"\nThis work presents the understanding of the clustering properties of Lyman alpha emitters at a redshift of 4.5, selected from the Large Area Lyman Alpha (LALA) survey. Our findings are based on an analyzed area of 36' x 36', which was observed with five narrowband filters and had an angular correlation function w(theta) fit to a power law with slope beta = 0.8. The Limber transformation, assuming a flat, Lambda-dominated universe, is used to calculate the correlation length r_0 of the real-space two-point correlation function xi(r) from the derived A_w value and discard any contamination, where r_0 = 3.20 +\/- 0.42 Mpc\/h. The measured clustering strength can be reproduced by Lyman alpha emitters residing in halos with a minimum mass of 1-2 times 10^11 Solar masses\/h. The estimated correlation length implies a bias of b ~ 3.7 which is similar to that of Lyman-break galaxies at z ~ 3.8-4.9. However, Lyman alpha emitters are found to be a factor of ~ 2-16 rarer than LBGs. This leads to the possibility that Lyman alpha emitters may occupy host halos of approximately the same mass of LBGs, but shine with a relatively low duty cycle of 6-50%."}
{"text":"This paper investigates the effect of radiative transfer on the UV pumping of the 21cm line in the high redshift universe.

Additionally, at 15 < z < 35, the total scattering rate of Lyman-alpha photons is enhanced by a factor of approximately 1 + 0.3 [ (1 + z)\/20 ] ^ 2\/3 in comparison to simulations not taking into account the full radiative transfer. Subsequently, the differential brightness of the 21cm signal from the cosmic microwave background is correspondingly boosted."}

This has the potential to not only test CDM predictions on small scales, but to also assess different WDM candidates. As a result of the analysis, a lower limit of several keV (< 10) was determined for the mass of warm dark matter derived from sterile neutrinos, which correlates to previous findings from observation of Lyman-$\\alpha$ forest and Cosmic Microwave Background."}

Unlike past studies, the authors do not detect any data supportive of gravitational magnification through the MgII systems, with the upper limit \\mu<1.10, while further estimating the amount of absorbers missed due to extinction with a probability of up to 50%.

{"text":"\nThis report examines the properties of a recurring ultraluminous X-ray source in the starburst galaxy M82. Using multiple Chandra observations spanning from 1999 to 2005, we discovered that this transient ULX was first detected in 1999 October, then dimmed out in 2000 January, only to reappear sometime afterwards. Its luminosity ranges from an undetectable level (~2.5x10^38 erg\/s) to as high as 1.3x10^40 erg\/s in the 0.5-10 keV energy band. Data analysis shows that the X-ray spectra of the source follows that of Galactic black hole binary candidates in their low\/hard state, with an especially hard spectrum in one particular observation. Moreover, near infrared images taken by the Hubble Space Telescope suggest that the ULX is associated with a star cluster, and radio imaging further indicates that it is linked to an H II region. We therefore suggest that the ULX could be a >100 solar mass intermediate-mass black hole in its low\/hard state. Additionally, two other ultraluminous X-ray emitting sources were discovered: one being a possible background active galactic nucleus, and the other a young supernova remnant possibly related to an ancient gamma-ray burst event."}

{"text":"\nThe CFHQS is a spectroscopic survey dedicated to probing the epoch of reionization at extremely high redshift. We report the discovery of first four CFHQS quasars at z>6, the highest being CFHQS J2329-0301 at z=6.43. We present the optical, infrared and millimeter photometry data as well as the optical and near-infrared spectroscopy. We explore the dust properties of these quasars and find a remarkable dust extinction curve for one quasar and a high contribution of far-infrared luminosity from dust emission in another. We observe a considerable lower mean millimeter continuum flux for CFHQS quasars than that of SDSS quasars, possibly due to its association with the UV luminosity of quasars. Analysis of the optical depths of two quasars with high signal-to-noise ratio in their optical spectra reveals that the intergalactic medium was likely substantially ionized before they were all ignited. These results suggest that reionization may have been a long process, but we note that the effect of cosmic variance still has to be accounted for."}
{"text":"This article examines the loop expansions for n-point functions of N=4 Yang-Mills theory and N=8 supergravity. It investigates the reggeization of both the gluon and the graviton. If the Bern, Dixon, Smirnov conjecture for planar gluon-gluon scattering is valid, then the ladder sum of SU(N) gauge theory completes the Regge limit with the trajectory function proportional to the cusp anomalous dimension. When it comes to graviton-graviton scattering, the corresponding Regge trajectory is constructed, as well as Regge cuts due to infinite sums of non-planar graphs. Finally, this article postulates that multiple exchanges of Regge poles in non-planar graphs may be connected to the existence of infinite number of non-perturbative massless states discovered by Green, Ooguri and Schwarz."}
{"text":"\nAnalyzing the plasma pressure distribution within the inner magnetosphere can provide insight into the origin and evolution of geomagnetic storms and substorms. In-situ measurements of particle fluxes taken by high-altitude satellites cannot capture the rapid changes in pressure associated with these events because the sampling rate is insufficiently rapid. In contrast, fast movement of low-altitude satellites permits the capture of quasi-instantaneous pressure profiles along their trajectories. Using data from the Aureole-3 satellite and three geomagnetic field models, it was found that during quiet geomagnetic periods, the observed pressure profiles were consistent with those from higher altitude measurements. When a geomagnetic storm occurred, the profiles became sharper, the location of maximum plasma pressure corresponded to the expected position for the Dst minimum, and the value for maximum inner magnetospheric pressure correlated strongly with solar wind dynamic pressure. It appears that the interchange instability played an important role in the main phase of the March 1-8, 1982 geomagnetic storm."}

{"text":"\nThe results of the BATSE survey provide evidence that 37 sources of Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) radiation from the range 20 to 300 keV may originate from collisions of Primordial Black Holes (PBH) with stars. These objects are relics from the hot matter of the early Universe and, based on the analogy of comets in the Solar System, their collisions with their parent star may be a regular event. PBHs are thought to power GRBs when they enter a stellar atmosphere and these bursts could display the main qualities of some GRBs. Their mass is estimated to be a fraction of the mass of the Sun and they are seen at distances of up to 50 ps, being distributed isotropically across the sky. It is thus suggested that some short GRBs could be detectable manifestations of PBHs in the universe."}

Our calculations, based on the spin wave approximation, reveal that the decoherence rate, quantified through a Gaussian decay function, is influenced by both the field strength and the anisotropy of the antiferromagnetic environment. The critical field strength at which the spin-flop transition in the antiferromagnetic environment occurs marks the peak of the central spin decoherence, providing results that corroborate recent quantum phase transition witness studies. We additionally consider the impact of temperature on the decoherence of the central spin."}

Additionally, the reconstructions of the dark energy equation-of-state and the deceleration parameter showed that the acceleration of the universe could have started in a redshift between 0.4 and 0.65. The most stringent constraint on w(z) lies in the redshift range z\u223c0.3\u20130.6."}
{"text":"\nThe purpose of this study is to look into the potential relationship between infrared color and line intensity ratios in various transitions of SiO masers. We compiled a sample of 75 SiO maser sources to examine the correlation between infrared colors and intensity ratios between the J=1-0 v=1, 2, and 3 lines. By utilizing the Nobeyama 45m telescope, we observed the sample in the SiO J=1-0 v=0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and J=2-1 v=1, 2 lines, as well as the 29SiO J=1-0 v=0 and J=2-1 v=0, and 30SiO J=1-0 v=0 lines, and the H2O 6(1,6)-5(2,3) line. We discovered that the intensity ratios of the SiO J=1-0 v=2 to v=1 lines have a clear correlation with infrared colors. In addition, it was found that there may be a correlation between infrared colors and the intensity ratios of the SiO J=1-0 v=3 to v=1&2 lines. It is plausible that two H2O overlap lines, 11(6,6) nu_2=1 -> 12(7,5) nu_2=0 and 5(0,5) nu_2=2 -> 6(3,4) nu_2=1, could be contributing to this correlation, though further investigations involving the effects of opacity on the variability of the results must be considered."}
{"text":"\nThis paper examines the origin of the Arches stellar cluster mass function, from the time evolution of pre-stellar cores in the center of a molecular cloud. We consider the coalescence of cores to be of importance in this process. For different distances from the cloud center, gravo-turbulent fragmention produces a number of gravitationally unstable cores. Evolutionary effects such as coalescence and collapse are examined regarding whether collapse rates for certain bins are higher than the rate of coalescence. The resulting model is able to accurately display the specific characteristics of the stellar cluster mass function, such as the slopes at high and low ends, and the bump at the ~5-6M_sol mark. Consequently, our research suggests that the current IMF of Arches is similar to its original, while the consequential effects of mass segregation remain absent."}
{"text":"\nThis article explores the multi-Higgs models with both spontaneous CP violation (SPCV) and natural flavor conservation (NFC). These models contradict evidence of a complex CKM matrix. However, a generalized $\\mu$-$\\tau$ symmetry (23) could resolve this clash. It would bring Higgs-induced flavor changing neutral currents (FCNC) down to levels that leave room for observable $B$ mixing effects without conflicting with $K^0-\\bar{K}^0$ mixing. Furthermore, this symmetry might reveal a new hierarchy in the couplings $F_{ij}^{u,d}$ between quarks in different generations ($i$ and $j$). A detailed investigation of quark masses and the CKM matrix allows us to better understand the complex relationships between $F_{ij}^{u,d}$. Combining this analysis with existing constraints from flavor and CP violations in the $K, B_d, B_s,$ and $D$ mesons implies that our model may only be viable with a relatively lightweight Higgs (100-150 GeV). If true, it predicts extra contributions to the magnitudes and phases of the $B^0_{d,s}-\\bar{B}^0_{d,s}$ mixing amplitudes as well as potentially detectable $D^0-\\bar{D}^0$ mixing levels."}
{"text":"\nThis study presents the effects of employing a Pauli potential with a density-dependent effective framework to account for the binding energies and root mean square radii of nuclei in a medium mass range. Monte Carlo many-body simulation is used within a simplified nucleon-nucleon interaction to determine the correlations attributable to the fermionic character of nucleons. The method is demonstrated to be agnostic to the details of the nucleon-nucleon interaction. When evaluating the procedure for symmetric nuclear matter at various densities with simulations containing up to 120 nucleons, it is revealed that finite size effects may influence the Pauli potential strength parametrization. However, for larger systems, this effect remains consistent."}
{"text":"\nWe present the derivation of the InterHourly Variability (IHV) index of geomagnetic activity that is based on hourly values and the sum of the unsigned differences between adjacent hours over a seven-hour interval centered on local midnight. This calculation is conducted independently for stations in both hemispheres and within six longitude sectors. Furthermore, available data permits the index to be derived from the 19th century onward. An analysis of IHV averages for stations with corrected geomagnetic latitude below 55 degrees indicates that it is strongly correlated with midlatitude range indices. This leads to the finding that the aa index before 1957 could be overestimated; however, this issue does not arise with the ap index. In addition, IHV averages are also correlated with solar wind parameters (BV^2). Merging the IHV and recently-developed Inter-Diurnal Variability (IDV) index yields an estimation of the solar wind speed from 1890-present, revealing yearly mean values that range from 303 km\/s in 1902 to 545 km\/s in 2003. Lastly, the product BV derived from B and V calculated respectively from IDV and IHV, coincide with results derived from the amplitude of the diurnal variation of the H component in the polar caps."}
{"text":"\nWe examine how non-adiabatic transport through a quantum dot turnstile is affected when signals are applied at the leads, as experienced in experiments conducted by Kouwenhoven and colleagues. Using the Keldysh formalism for Tight-binding models, this study determines current fluctuations and averages over successive pumping periods. We find that when potentials are suddenly engaged, transient features of the fluctuating and average currents are of the highest significance in the high-frequency region. In such a circumstance, the system's efficiency as a pump is decreased, as charge is primarily retrieved from both sides of the leads in order to fill levels under the bias window. With a finite bias, and a low-frequency pumping signal, the amount of charge crossing the system is dependent on the number of levels contained in the bias window. Investigating the inner charge dynamics of the system, and the influence of energy sidebands, this research additionally shows the emergence of the termed 'satellite peaks of the averaged current' within the transient regime."}
{"text":"An algorithm for generating exhaustive lists of rooted trivalent diagrams of a given size has been developed and analyzed. This algorithm has optimal performance, as the time needed to generate a diagram is bounded, meaning it has the CAT (constant amortized time) property. The paper also provides a general framework for algorithms producing exhaustive lists of complex combinatorial structures, addressing both labeled and unlabeled structures, with attention focused on generators possessing the CAT property."}
{"text":"This paper provides a comprehensive response to the comments previously made by Weniger regarding the papers written by Guseinov and colleagues in the journals from 1978 to 2006. Our analysis is conducted through a critical inspection of the arguments suggested in Weniger's comments and reveals some serious flaws. In our papers, we have highlighted the validity of the unsymmetrical and symmetrical one range addition theorems for Slater type orbitals, Coulomb-Yukawa like correlated interaction potentials (CIPs) and their derivatives, which can be deduced from the expansions of the corresponding Hilbert spaces in terms of ETOs that are complete and orthonormal sets of exponential type orbitals. The minor issue brought up by Weniger is insignificant relative to the conclusions made. In addition, to attest to the credibility of the formulas, they were validated by computer calculations. Lastly, we reject Weniger's claims regarding inconsistencies and flaws in the theoretical framework, which were found to be erroneous. The paper contains all the answers to Weniger's comments."}
{"text":"\nThis paper examines the potential implications of a discrepancy between the MSSM Higgs parameter space currently excluded by the CDF Collaboration and its expected sensitivity, as seen with ~1 fb^-1 of integrated luminosity. Specifically, we analyze the possibility that a light heavy MSSM Higgs signal could be observed in the unexcluded part of the sensitive region within the NUHM model, which approximates scalar mass contributions as universal, apart from those to Higgs masses. Other constraints such as dark matter, electroweak precision observables, B physics observables and M_h must be taken into account, and the analysis suggests that supersymmetric signatures should likely be detected in the near future in these areas. Furthermore, the dark matter candidate associated with the model should be close to being found in direct detection experiments."}
{"text":"\nThe trans-Planckian challenge in cosmology emerges as physical wavelengths of fluctations are pursued back in time to become smaller and more miniscule, past the Planck scale, to where the ideals of conventional quantum field theory (QFT) become distorted and uneffective. Discussion on this matter is predominantly conducted within the context of Inflation, however, trans-Planckian reasoning is a lot broader. In this study, we investigate this concept in the growing and diminishing Milne universe, where wavelengths become red or blue-shifted. Consequently, deviations from the norms of QFT should produce a UV-dependent VeV of the energy momentum tensor of the scalar field in the Milne universe. Yet, we observe that the Milne universe is merely a coordinate system of the flat Minkowsi space-time, and the covariant energy momentum tensor should remain equivalent irrespective of the mentioned coordinates of the flat space-time geometry. Subsequent to this, we ascertain that the energy momentum tensor, with the Adiabatic Vacuum selected, is zero in Minkowski coordinates, and constant as zero in the shrinking Milne universe. In contrast to this, trans-Planckian modifications of QFT are not validated based on these assertions. Furthermore, similar reasoning is applied to other cosmological models with curvature much smaller than Planckian, which generates further discrepancy between the realities of trans-Planckin considerations."}
{"text":"\nResearch carried out on a 0.65[Pb(Ni_1\/3Nb_2\/3)O_3]-0.35PbTiO_3 ceramic sample revealed a ferroelectric relaxor transition at a temperature of 350K - this transition is evidenced by a Vogel-Fulcher freezing temperature of 338K and the emergence of a non-ergodic relaxor ferroelectric phase of tetragonal structure at room temperature. Further dielectric measurements suggests that at low temperatures the sample reenters the relaxor state, evident by the appearance of a frequency-dependent anomaly in the imaginary part of the dielectric constant at around 160K which follows the Vogel-Fulcher type of temperature dependence. The magnetization results indicate that this low temperature dielectric anomaly is not linked to any magnetic transition, while x-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements reveal a structural transition between a tetragonal and monoclinic phase at approx. 225K. It is hypothesized that the conformally miniaturized monoclinic domains formed inside the tetragonal domains during the structural transition are what is causing the low-temperature dielectric dispersion."}
{"text":"\nIn this article, an effective field theory approach is taken to investigate the occurrence of nucleon-nucleon scattering in spin-triplet states. An additional low-energy scale relating to the strength of one-pion exchange is identified. Subsequent analysis follows a new power-counting scheme in which the key term is brought to a considerably lower order than usual. Results indicate that for angular momenta L=2 or less, the first three terms of the new ordering effectively explain the residual scattering up to 300 MeV. Meanwhile, in waves with L>=3, the scattering agrees with the traditional perturbative arrangement. Prognoses made on the critical momenta in connection with such channels prove to be correct."}
{"text":"\nWe employ Hubble Space Telescope phase-resolved spectroscopy to investigate the cataclysmic variable system WZ Sge. Our analysis of 13 absorption lines reveals an orbit-velocity semi-amplitude of 47 +\/- 3 km\/s with a significant 0.1 phase offset. This radial velocity, together with Steeghs et al's estimates of K_2 and the known inclination of the system, suggest primary and secondary masses of 0.88 < M_1 < 1.53 M_sun and 0.078 < M_2 < 0.13 M_sun, respectively. Additionally, we are able to estimate the primary mass from the gravitational red-shift of 56+\/-5 km\/s, resulting in an independent value of M_1 = 0.85+\/-0.04 M_sun and one that is consistent with spectrophotometric fits to the UV flux. Despite these promising results, the source of the spectral offset is an area of further study."}
{"text":"\nWe probe the impact of thermal bath environments on the entanglement dynamics of two continuous variable systems, such as two modes of the electromagnetic field or two nanomechanical oscillators. By means of the quantum open system method, we formulate the non-Markovian master equations of the reduced density matrix for two models of two interacting harmonic oscillators. Model A assumes that each oscillator isseparately coupled to its own bath, and for Model B, the two oscillators are linked to a common bath. To assess the extent of entanglement in bipartite Gaussian states, we assess the logarithmic negativity. Our results show that the evolution of the quantum entanglement is sensitive to the initial states, the inteaction between oscillators, the coupling to an individual bath, and connecting to a shared bath."}
{"text":"\nIn 1905, the concept of relativism revolutionized the way we perceive reality. In this historic transformation, Einstein symbolizes the pivotal figure connecting the sciences, arts, and humanities. By analyzing the physic and nature based sciences, the social sciences, and literature and fine arts between 1885 and 1925, this paper seeks to understand the shift away from dogma toward the uncertainty of creative adventure. At its core is the adamant belief that taking the second path ultimately leads to more equitable societies. Now, a century later, we are still presented with the same two choices - to stay sheltered in the confines of 'objective' dogma, or to embrace the challenge of multiple, ever-changing perspectives."}
{"text":"This article introduces a computational approach, based on molecular dynamics (m.d.) simulations, for determining the chemical potential of molecules adsorbed onto solid surfaces. The method allows for the calculation of adsorption and desorption from any coverage and temperature without any pre-assumed statistical mechanics approximations of adsorption sites. To demonstrate the technique, ab initio m.d. simulations of H$_2$O on MgO (001) are performed at low coverage. Results suggest that the PBE exchange-correlation form accurately captures the adsorption energy, however this needs to be further tested by increasing coverage. Moreover, the Polanyi-Wigner frequency prefactor is found to be two orders of magnitude larger than typically assumed prior. In addition, the method allows for the incorporation of quantum nuclear effects via path-integral simulations."}
{"text":"\nThe purpose of this study was to observe measurement backaction on an atomic gas confined within an optically driven Fabry-Perot Cavity and to measure the quantum force fluctuations of this field. In order to prepare the resonator to the ground-state, it was necessary to first overcome the current issue of thermal noise reigning measurement. A single collective vibrational mode was isolated due to the cavity-mode structure, and then measured by the cavity's optical properties, thereby sequestering it from the external environment. This research marks the first time a macroscopic mechanical resonator was observed and measured at the Standard Quantum Limit."}
{"text":"\nWe present a comprehensive investigation into the behaviour of maximal operators\nassociated with smooth hypersurfaces in 3-dimensional Euclidean space when $p>2$. If\nthere is no affine tangent plane to the hypersurface passing through the origin and\nit is an analytic surface, then the maximal operator is bounded on $L^p(\\RR^3)$ if\nand only if $p>h(S),$ where $h(S)$ is the height of the surface. For non-analytic\nfinite type cases, we obtain the same result with the exception of $p=h(S)$.\nThis connection is related to A. N. Varchenko's notion of surface height for functions $\\phi$ such\nthat $S$ can be represented as the graph of $\\phi$ after a rotation of coordinates.\nThe derived result has several implications, including confirming conjectures by E.M.\nStein and A. Iosevich and E. Sawyer concerning the Fourier transform of the surface\nmeasure on $S$ and its decay rate. Furthermore, a conjecture by Iosevich and Sawyer\nrelating the boundedness of the associated maximal operator to an integrability condition\non $S$ is also substantiated. Finally, V.I. Arnol'd's conjecture on uniform Fourier\ntransform estimates for the surface measure is implicitly verified by our extension\nof a result by V.N. Karpushkin."}
{"text":"\nBy making use of the phase coexistence method and density functional theory (DFT) with the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof exchange-correlation functional, we studied the ab initio melting curve of molybdenum for a pressure range of 0-400 GPa. Through validations of the theoretical model it was established that molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using an embedded atom model (EAM) could accurately reflect experimental data. By applying free energy corrections to the reference MD meltdown curve the ab initio results were determined. The resulting curves were comparable to the shock data collected under higher pressure, yet they did not agree with the high pressure results gleaned from static compression experiments. In addition, the radial distribution function and densities of states of both the liquid and the high-temperature solid showed only small differences. On this data, it is proposed that there is no evidence to back the theory that b.c.c. transition metals have exceptionally low dTm\/dP values due to electron redistribution from s-p to d states."}
{"text":"We investigate the dynamics of quasi-localized gravity on 5D braneworlds inspired by the GRS model. We consider how the normalizable zero mode and graviton resonance modes, which originate from the contribution of massive KK modes, interplay with each other. We find that a scale exists at which 4D gravity is reproduced, and both the resonance and the zero mode have significant contributions. At larger scales, gravity is primarily mediated by the zero mode, while the resonance gives only minor corrections. We also consider an asymmetric version of the GRS model, featuring different cosmological constants on each side, and show that the asymmetry weakens the resonance, resulting in a shorter-lived feature that exhibits 4D gravity over a shorter distance scale. Lastly, we present an altered GRS model in which a positive tension brane is replaced with a scalar field propagating in the bulk. Together, our results indicate the important role resonances play in the behavior of quasi-localized gravity on braneworlds."}
{"text":"\nIn this work, we investigate the behavior of a single vacancy in a classical dimer model on square lattice. By constructing a graph-theoretic classification of all configurations, we enlarge the idea of a close-packing dimer model in the form of a spanning tree. We determine the probability of the vacancy being completely static in an infinite system to be 57\/4-10Sqrt[2], and characterise the domain accessible to the vacancy by a power law decay with an exponent of 9\/8. For finite systems, the probability that a vacancy in the bulk can reach the boundary decays with system size as a power law of exponent 1\/4, allowing the weak localisation of the vacancy. Moreover by forming a linkage between the vacancy diffusion exponent and the diffusion on a spanning tree, we implement numerical simulations of the model with free and periodic boundary conditions."}
{"text":"\nInstead of viewing the scheduler as an adversary, who may try to undermine safety properties of protocol models, we look at a restricted class of admissible schedulers. These are schedulers which are only able to react to previous behaviour of the system which is visible to the adversary. From this perspective, we propose a probabilistic definition of anonymity: the identity of users and the observations of the adversary are independent random variables that can only be affected by the prior behaviour of the system. To demonstrate anonymity, a proof technique of 'exchange' can be used wherein two users' behaviours can be swapped without the adversary 'noticing'."}
{"text":"\nIn modern cosmology, the large amount of high precision observational data has enabled us to form models of the Universe which try to approximate our observable patch of the Universe with the assumption that it is homogeneous on a large scale. From the observed structures on increasing scales, we know that these models only represent a smoothed or averaged form of the underlying inhomogeneous pattern. However, when trying to model the Universe, we often use normal functions to signify the kinematics of the velocity field, assuming these functions are volume averages of the finer-scale inhomogeneities and then introducing them raw into the Einstein equations. This method, posed by Ellis and Stoeger in the 80s, faces a number of theoretical and observational challenges which have been brought to the forefront in recent years due to the large amount of available data and the decrease in the scale of homogeneity that can be assumed. In this article, we evaluate this 'fitting problem' in accordance with the latest developments of observational and theoretical cosmology."}
{"text":"\nThis paper connects harmonic analysis on the infinite symmetric group to stochastic processes. By introducing a family of probability measures, the z-measures, on the Thoma simplex, we construct a family of diffusions processes related to these measures. These diffusions are obtained by taking a certain kind of scaling limit of a Markov chain on partitions of natural numbers. For each z-measure, there is a unique invariant distribution and the process is ergodic with respect to it. In addition, the process is reversible due to the symmetry of the measure. We provide details of the spectrum of the generator and the associated (pre)Dirichlet form of the process."}
{"text":"This article aims to provide theoretical predictions for the intensity, profile and maps of the 372.4 GHz transition of ortho-H$_2$D$^+$ line emission expected in Proto-Planetary Disks. To this end, the physical and chemical structure of disks is determined from a model developed by Ceccarelli & Dominik (2005), and the emission line is evaluated with a radiative transfer method introduced by Elitzur & Asensio Ramos (2006). Our study presents intensity maps convolved with the expected ALMA resolution, which demonstrate the origin of the line, where it probes the mid-plane out to several tens of AU. The variation of line profile across the image provides valuable information about the velocity field, while the double peak shape at most inclination angles of the total disk flux revealed in our spectral profiles. This confirms that the 372.4 GHz H$_2$D$^+$ line is a good indicator of the mid-plane of Proto-Planetary Disks, and that current submillimeter telescopes may be used, albeit with some difficulties, to observe it. In addition, the future ALMA interferometer will have enough sensitivity to observe, and even spatially resolve, the line emission."}

We successfully populate molecular states with up to eight units of rotational angular momentum, uncovering avoided level crossings through the change of magnetic moments and a Landau-Zener tunneling method. Utilizing microwave spectroscopy, we precisely measure the magnetic-field dependent binding energy of the complex s-wave state that produces the large background scattering length of Cs and it's quantum-halo character.

{"text":"\nWe investigate how lattice chirality affects the decoupling of mirror fermions. To do so, we demonstrate that the partition functions of lattice gauge theories with vectorlike fermion representations can be divided into 'light' and 'mirror' procedures, such that each representation is chiral. This method only works reliably when the two sectors are anomaly-free. Thus, the use of additional high-scale dynamics to decouple the mirror fermions in a gauge-symmetric phase at a strong mirror-Yukawa coupling is dependent on satisfying the same anomaly-free condition. We also use our findings to explain a recent numerical paradox concerning the mirror-fermion spectrum in a toy 2-dimensional would-be-anomalous theory. Overall, our results unveil new properties concerning the partition functions of chiral theories on a lattice that could be useful for future explorations."}
{"text":"\nExoplanets are of particular fascination to astronomers due to the possibility of them being habitable. To obtain the spectrum of a terrestrial planet orbiting in the habitable zone of its star is a great feat, however the challenge of isolating the light of the planet from that of its star still persists. In the last decade, dynamics-based methods, as opposed to imaging techniques, have facilitated this endeavor significantly. We propose that more focused efforts be given to technologies such as radial-velocity measurements, transit photometry, and occultation spectroscopy in order to obtain spectra of exoplanets. M-dwarfs, which have a habitable zone close to their star, have seen a rise in transits and radial-velocity variations, making them prime candidates for studying the atmospheres of terrestrial planets with occultation spectroscopy. A dedicated ground-based transit survey of the 10,000 nearest M-dwarfs, with their favorable planet-star contrast ratio, could consequently fulfill this quest."}
{"text":"This article explores the evolution of supernovae in a wind-blown bubble created by a Wolf-Rayet star. Our simulations of the CSM and the SN shock wave reveal the presence of a range of fluctuations in density and pressure in the surrounding medium. This causes the SN shock to interact with the dense shell in an irregular fashion and produces numerous transmitted and reflected shock waves within the wind bubble. The effects on X-ray emission and several hydrodynamic instabilities caused by these shock waves are discussed and modeled. The findings indicate that due to the non-spherical nature of the interactions, the SN shock wave is distorted and its impact is visible over an extended period."}
{"text":"\nSpitzer high resolution spectroscopic observations have led to the discovery of an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) in the nearby SAd galaxy NGC3621. These observations indicate the presence of [NeV] 14 and 24 um emissions, which peak at the near-infrared nucleus. Through analysis of the [NeV] line luminosity, nuclear bolometric luminosity is estimated to be ~5X10^41 ergs s^-1. Taking into account the Hubble type of the galaxy, this leads to a lower mass limit for the black hole of ~4X10^3 Msun, which is consistent with the established correlation of black hole mass to stellar velocity dispersion in predominantly early-type galaxies. In order further investigate this AGN, additional follow-up multi-wavelength observations are necessary to accurately measure the bulge mass, black hole mass, rate of accretion, and nuclear bolometric luminosity. This discovery supports the idea that black holes can form and develop in galaxies containing minimal or no bulge."}
{"text":"\nAnalyzing 17 QSO spectra in a redshift range of 5.74<zem<6.42, we make an attempt to obtain a precise estimate of the ratio of neutral hydrogen atoms to the total number of hydrogen atoms in the extensive volumes of the universe at z~6. Performing a Ly\u03b1 forest simulation, we infer that xHI (the volume-averaged neutral hydrogen fraction) increases steadily from 10^-4.4 at z=5.3 to 10^-4.2 at z=5.6. The maximal upper limit is 0.36 at z=6.3. Examining the transmission windows or peaks, as well as the wide dark portions or gaps occurring between them, we infer that they stem from a mixture of cosmological underdensities and HII areas around faint quasars or galaxies. We observe a transverse proximity effect in the HI Ly\u03b1 forest in the case of the intervening HII region of a faint quasar located at z=5.70 and its impact on SDSS J1148+5251 at z=6.42, the first of its kind. This interlock provides a lower limit for the lifetime of the foreground quasar of 11 million years at least. The widths of the detected peaks seem broader than the simulated ones, suggesting that either the assumption of the photoionization equilibrium is flawed or radiative transfer effects are in play."}
{"text":"\nWe report findings from X-ray, infrared, and radio-wave observations of a field related to the X-ray source 1E 1547.0-5408 in the Galactic Plane. Evidence from a new Chandra observation shows that 1E 1547.0-5408 is small at arc-second-scale resolution, and a XMM observation suggests its X-ray spectrum is manifested by absorbing functions of a power law and blackbody model. Comparing its X-ray flux from the year 1980 to 2006 indicates a decline in the 0.5 - 10 keV X-ray flux from ~2x10^-12 ergs cm-2 s-1 to ~3x10^-13 ergs cm-2. Also, an observation in the infrared area shows an unrelated field source near its location, with a Ks magnitude of 15.9+\/-0.2, resulting in a limitation of the IR magnitude of 1E 1547.0-5408 to >17.5. Furthermore, archival radio findings reveal a 4' diameter shell, G327.24-0.13, which may be an unidentified supernova remnant, is present near 1E 1547.0-5408 prompting if the two are related. The X-ray elements of 1E 1547.0-5408 classify it as a magnetar, a neutron star whose energy derives from the decomposition of a powerful magnetic field. This connection between 1E 1547.0-5408 and G327.24-0.13 suggests it is associated with a young supernova remnant and will join the limited number of known pairings between magnetars and supernova remnants, however further detection of the two are needed to confirm the conclusion."}
{"text":"\nThis research introduces EC-FORC (Electrochemical first-order reversal curve), a new type of cyclic voltammetry technology, designed to detect and analyze phase transitions in adsorbate layers. This new method can distinguish between continuous and discontinuous phase transitions, predicting equilibrium behavior of the system with a continuous phase transition. The EC-FORC analysis of systems with discontinuous phase transition yields a negative region in the curve, whereas this region is absent in the case of a continuous phase transition. Additionally, the EC-FORC method is capable of recovering the equilibrium state in the system through the minima in the respective curves, even at very high scan rates. The implementation of this method is simple and convenient, requiring only a reprogramming of the potentiostat used in conventional cyclic voltammetry experiments. Thus, EC-FORC promises to be an efficient, in-situ tool for analyzing electrochemical deposition."}
{"text":"\nThis paper presents a rigorous statistical framework for determining whether empirical data sets follow a power-law distribution. Through an exploration of maximum-likelihood fitting methods and goodness-of-fit tests, this method is compared to previously applied approaches. Tests performed on synthetic data and 24 real-world data sets from a variety of disciplines validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. Results often confirm conjectures about the power-law behaviour of the data, but suggest that power law is sometimes ruled out. This principled approach to assessing power-laws enables deeper understanding of natural and man-made phenomena."}

We implement an energy-based approach obtained via non-equilibrium thermodynamics which is conveyed as Hermitian operators, to keep tabs on both the motion equation as well as the energy balance. The resultant modes stand out as long wavelength perturbations in heterogeneous milieu. Such a tricky system requires an analytic examination of the stability since there is an entire spectrum of consonant modes along with a solitary unstable mode with a lifetime roughly identical to coronal loops. Finally, to assess the functionalities of wave and flow based models, a comparison is drawn."}
{"text":"This paper explores the effects of bilayer coupling and in-plane magnetic field on meta-nematic transitions in a bilayer system, as it pertains to the bilayer ruthenate Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$. We hypothesize that the in-plane magnetic field in the bilayer system creates a pure nematic phase with a resistivity anisotropy when it impacts the energetics of domain formation by breaking the degeneracy of two different nematic orientations. Additionally, we postulate that bilayer coupling opens a pathway to a previously undiscovered nematic phase which preserves the x-y symmetry of the Fermi surfaces."}
{"text":"\nIn this multi-wavelength study, we have identified and studied a sample of 24 Lyman-alpha emitters at redshift z ~ 3.15 in the GOODS South Field. Our analysis reveals that their average properties include low metallicity (Z\/Z_sun = 0.005) and low dust extinction (A_V ~ 0.32), as well as medium stellar masses of approximately 10^9 M_sun. The age is not well constrained. The observed Ly-alpha-emitters appear to be in agreement with the selection criteria for U-band dropouts, yet are typically fainter than the current Lyman Break Galaxy limit. We also detect some filamentary structure in the charge distribution of the sample, to a 4-sigma level. This research highlights the advantages of Ly-alpha-emitters as tracers of faint star-forming galaxies in the distant universe, and demonstrates that these galaxies are an underexploited source of dust-free, low-metallicity, medium-mass objects."}
{"text":"In this paper and its companion (Paper II), we provide evidence and analysis of how gravitational lensing-induced magnification can anisotropically distort the 3D correlation and power spectrum of galaxies and quasars. We show that on scales of ~100 Mpc\/h, there is preferential enhancement of the observed correlation along the line-of-sight (LOS) orientation, which can reach up to a factor of a few at a redshift of z ~ 0.35, even when the intrinsic correlations are weak. We also reveal that this anisotropic distortion can be distinguishable from the standard distortion from peculiar motions regime. Such magnification must be taken into account when interpreting upcoming data with greater precision, as shifts in the inferred parameters, such as the Hubble parameter and angular diameter distance, can be biased by up to ~3% along the LOS and ~0.6% in the monopole, depending on the redshift, bias and number counts slope.

{"text":"\nUsing Chandra and XMM observations, we confirmed the presence of a large-scale velocity disparity across Abell 576 in the NE\/E-W\/SW direction, agreeing with previous ASCA SIS measurements. At 90% confidence level, the maximum velocity difference exceeded 3.3E03 km\/s, similar to limits found in the bullet cluster (1E0657-56). It is unlikely the velocity gradient is caused by random fluctuations in both Chandra and XMM data, or Hubble distance discrepancies between the two merging clusters. We mapped the abundance of chemical elements and determined a strong chemical difference between the West-Northwest and East regions, going from 100% SN Ia iron mass fraction to 32%. The cluster center was located at this chemical boundary, potentially owing to a cluster straight merger. This velocity gradient may also result in changes in CMB temperature that could be identified by current and upcoming bolometers. All of this evidence suggests Abell 576 could be entering a line-of-sight merger."}
{"text":"\nWe present findings from an extensive survey of neutron-capture elements in Galactic planetary nebulae (PNe), in an effort to examine the s-process nucleosynthesis of their progenitor stars. We used K band observations of 120 PNe and added literature data to detect the emission lines [Kr III] 2.199 and\/or [Se IV] 2.287 $\\mu$m in 81 of them; Se and Kr abundances were obtained with ionization correction formulae. The range in Se and Kr abundances pointed towards self-enrichment due to local s-process nucleosynthesis, with Kr abundance being enhanced to a larger extent than that of Se. There were positive correlations between s-process enrichments and C\/O ratio and PNe with H-deficient Wolf-Rayet central stars did not display greater s-process enrichments than PNe with H-rich stars. Taking incomplete PN luminosity into account, we estimate a minimum of 20% of Galactic PNe to have significant s-process enrichments."}
{"text":"\nWe explore the correlations between ultraviolet-selected galaxies utilizing data from GALEX-SDSS at redshift below 0.6 and from CFHTLS Deep u' Imaging at z=1. The comparison of the two datasets furnish an unparalleled foundation at z<1. This examination examines the reliance of clustering parameters (r0, delta) on Ultra Violet luminosity and examines the progression of the bias driving force. Our investigation uncovers a steady decrease in bias from high (b>2) to low redshift (b ~ 0.79+\/- 0.08). Taking into account the sum of star formation in the distinct samples, we propose that most of the star formation migrated from massive dark matter halos situated in dense territories at z>2 (10^12 < M_min <10^13M_sun) to low mass halos found in locales of low thickness at low redshift (M_min <10^12M_sun). This result celebrates and extebds the 'downsizing' depiction to dark matter dispersion."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate the dynamics of disordered solids undergoing shear deformation through the Shear Transformation Zone (STZ) model. By analyzing the theory, we compare it to a simulation performed by Shi et al (2007) and find that it is able to reproduce the strain localization and capture the relevant features observed within the process. We discover that the perturbations to the effective temperature can cause instability in the transient phase, but the emergence of shear bands depends on the interactions between the energy dissipation processes and the growth of the disturbance. We subsequently create a criterion based on the initial conditions to describe which materials will present strain localization. Additionally, we learn that the width of the shear band is determined by a rate-dependent dynamical scale and not a predetermined length scale."}
{"text":"\nThis paper examines how mutual interactions of multiple large bodies orbiting a central star, in the presence of eccentricity dissipation, cause changes in the semi-major axis. For the conditions pertinent to the oligarchic stage of planet formation, dynamical friction keeps the eccentricities small, reducing collision risks. If protoplanets move away from each other at a distance much greater than their Hill radius, they should remain relatively unperturbed. When two or more orbits are within a Hill radius from each other, the protoplanets are drawn towards equilibrium spacing between each other, thus creating a stable configuration of co-orbital oligarchs. We demonstrate that during the oligarchic phase of planet formation, each feeding zone contains several oligarchs instead of the single one previously thought. This finding has implications in the outer solar system, increasing the mass of the disk required to form the ice giants. In the inner solar system, this requires more giant impacts than anticipated to form fewer, final oligarchs. This suggests that Mars is not a pristine vestige of the oligarchic phase; it more likely is composed of multiple oligarchs that merged through giant impacts."}
{"text":"\nThis paper outlines the analytic result for the one-loop, massless triangle Feynman diagram. In doing so, the analysis exposes a fundamental physical principle embodied in the conservation of momentum that necessitates a reduction in the total number of linearly independent (l.i.) hypergeometric functions $F_4$ in the diagram's overall solution. To accomplish a total reduction in the number of l.i. functions entering the most general solution, this paper draws on analogies that exist between electric resistance circuit networks and Feynman diagrams, which allows for the identification of which three $F_4$ are relevant to the analytic solution. These analogies are constructed based on the equivalence between the structures of electric circuits of type \"Y\" and \"Delta\" with regards to the dissipated energy in a conserved current. Through this analysis, it is possible to identify which $F_4$ are fundamental to understanding the principle of conservation of momentum in the Feynman diagram."}
{"text":"\nWe examine the X-ray spectral properties of the Seyfert-1 galaxy NGC 4593, utilizing XMM-Newton EPIC-pn data. We find more complexity in the 0.5-10 keV spectrum than a straightforward power-law shape, including a soft excess and absorption by a highly ionized plasma. We argue that the soft surplus is most likely caused by thermal Comptonization, but this interpretation does not hold up to a reflection from an ionized accretion disk. We observe two iron-K emission lines at 6.4 and 6.97 keV, with the 6.4 keV line being the only discernible part. The 6.4 line appears to originate from the outer radii of the accretion disk or the torus of the Seyfert unification schemes and is not correlated with the temporal changes in the underlying continuum. The X-ray continuum changes over time, and we measure a potential scattering time-lag of 230 seconds, which may give us some insight into the primary X-ray source's physical size of 2 gravitational radii. Our analysis here appears to go against traditional ideas of what an AGN looks like."}
{"text":"\nThis paper investigates the homogenization of two-phase incompressible\nviscoelastic flows with arbitrary interface geometries, like periodicity, statistical homogeneity, or scale separation. Utilizing G-convergence and oscillating test functions, customarily non-local in time, that satisfy divergence-free constraints, we arrive at an effective medium in the form of a single phase viscoelastic material, which may not be of the Kelvin-Voight type. The resultant effective constitutive equation retains a long memory viscoelastic term as well as instantaneous elastic and viscous terms. This novel approach accounts for the conservation of mass and momentum equations, coupled with the interface advection of the flow."}
{"text":"\nThe present research investigates the migration of uranium (U) and thorium (Th) in the Earth and other terrestrial planets, as well as the consequences that arise due to their unique patterns of distribution. The theoretical models developed suggest that the presence of oxidation volatile components and water in the Earth form an enrichment zone (EZ) of U and Th, which is essential for the development of plate tectonic systems providing energy sources to the formation of continental crusts. In other terrestrial planets such as Mercury, Venus, and Mars, an EZ can not be formed due to a lack of oxygen components and water, resulting in the absence of plate tectonics. Moreover, the role of U and Th located in EZ has been identified as a key driving force in the evolution of life on Earth. As per the authors\u2019 expectations, common mechanisms can be explored to explain the similarities and differences between the Earth and the planets making up the solar system, and deepen our understanding of the formation and evolution of life on Earth and its planetary dynamics."}
{"text":"\nIn this paper, we propose and evaluate an improved technique to track nuclear flame propagation during the deflagration stage of a Type Ia Supernova, within the context of the Gravitationally Confined Detonation (GCD) framework. Our approach integrates a simplified 3-stage burning model with a non-static ash state and an artificially thickened advection-diffusion-reaction (ADR) flame front, providing an accurate yet efficient representation of the flame's energy release and electron capture. Thanks to its optimized numerical structure, our ADR-based model offers successful noise control compared to earlier schemes. We further develop our model to examine the effects of buoyancy in the hot ash, and verify its compatibility with varying numerical resolutions. Results show that if detonated in material from the first rising bubble, yet confined to the surface of the White Dwarf, the mass of Nickel-56 produced in the Type Ia Supernova is affected by the distance of the ignition point to the center of the star. We conclude that, in combination with a suitably random starting configuration, the GCD scenario provides a plausible explanation for the variety of Nickel-56 masses seen in these supernovae."}
{"text":" We present our findings on the rearrangement of the vortex lattice in a pinning free superconductor with increasing applied current. This is due to the change of shape of the vortex core caused by the non-equilibrium effects of the vortex motion, similar to that found in the Larkin-Ovchinnikov theory. A deficit of quasiparticles is created in front of the moving vortex and an excess of quasiparticles are generated behind the core. This creates an effective direction-dependent interaction between vortices, forming a wake region behind the vortex with a suppressed order parameter. When vortex velocity surpasses a critical value, quasi-phase slip lines may then appear, co-existing with slowly moving vortices between them. Our results are validated when coherence length $\\xi(T)$ is greater or at least close in value to the decay length $L_{in}$ of the non-equilibrium quasiparticle distribution. This research is further supports experiments from instability of the vortex flow at lower magnetic fields, when distance between vortices $a\\gg L_{in}\\gg\\xi(T)$. We postulate that for velocity exceeding $v_c$ this same instability should happen even when $a<L_{in}$."}

{"text":"In this paper, Kumar et al. (2006) discuss the contentious issue of the order of the polynomial equation for the dispersion relation of MHD waves.

After Dwivedi & Pandey (2006) corrected their energy equation, they hypothesised that the dispersion relation should still be a sixth order polynomial. Kumar et al.

In this article, they aim to resolve this dispute and explain the source of discrepancy between the two groups."}
{"text":"\nIn this study, we use Minkowski functionals and shapefinders to conduct a detailed analysis of the morphology of the richest superclusters from the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey and from the Millennium Simulation. We compare the observed and modeled superclusters to ascertain their sizes, shapes, and clumpiness. We find that rich superclusters are often elongated filaments with high-density clumps at their core. The fourth Minkowski functional $V_3$ is used to quantify the clumpiness of superclusters, with the morphology of superclusters described by a distinctive curve in the $K_1$-$K_2$ shapefinder plane. Moreover, our results indicate that the difference between the fourth Minkowski functional $V_3$ for faint and bright galaxies in observed superclusters is more pronounced than in the simulated superclusters."}
{"text":"\nIn this study, we explore the galaxy makeup of the most abundant superclusters in the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey using luminosity density distributions and the Minkowski functional V3. We compare the properties of grouped and separate galaxies in regions of varying density in superclusters. Results indicate that in major cores of rich superclusters there is an excess of early type, inactive galaxies among both group members and non-members, whereas in areas of lesser density in the outer reaches, there are more star-forming blue galaxies in groups and non-grouped galaxies. This reveals that the content of groups is dependent upon the milieu in which they reside. The arrangement of the luminosity density and the behavior of the Minkowski functional V3 for different superclusters reveal considerable variance between supercluster substructures. It is concluded from this research that not only local (group\/cluster) but also overall (supercluster) conditions play vital roles in forming galaxy morphology as well as star formation activity. SCL126, with its numerous X-ray clusters in the high-density core and a limited proportion of star-forming galaxies, could be evidence of an earlier start to its development compared to SCL9."}

{"text":"\nWe use recent experimental advancements in the field of charm physics to analyse the potential of new physics to modify rare charm meson decay rates.

{"text":"\nThis paper is centered on the study of the Near Earth Object (144898) 2004 VD17; the physical characteristics of the asteroid are largely unknown despite its potential to cause great damage to Earth in the future.

Our polarimetric and spectrographic data concluded the asteroid was an E-type and most closely resembled the spectrum of the aubrite meteorite Mayo Belwa. Additionally, the polarimetric albedo (p_v=0.45) and photometric data indicated a diameter somewhere around 320 meters and a rotational period of approximately 2 hours. In comparison to Pravac and Harris' (2000) estimates for fast rotator asteroids, our data suggest 2004 VD17 may have a more robust structure such as a monolith or a rubble pile in its \"strength regime\" (Holsapple 2002)."}

{"text":"\nThis research study explores the use of localized support for the best device selection as an injection point in a hybrid network. Ad-hoc networks are a popular trend in wireless technology, however, they do not always fully function in large-scale settings. To make sure a connection always remains, mobile devices are equipped with GSM or UMTS adapters in order to communicate with remote devices or a surrounding network infrastructure. To efficiently disseminate pertinent information, injection points are essential. Yet, it is difficult to identify which device should serve as the injection point, so localized algorithms were used to base the selection off of 2-hop neighboring information. Results have shown that this method is successful in efficiently sending information through the ad-hoc network. Furthermore, these results are beneficial for clusterhead election in clustering mechanisms."}
{"text":"\nThis paper investigates the physical and kinematic properties of potential tidal dwarf galaxy (TDG) candidates located in a sample of ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs). Using optical integral field spectroscopy (IFS) and high angular resolution Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging, we discovered 12 external star-forming regions across 5 ULIRGs. These regions presented a wide range of dynamical mass (up to 10$^{10}$ M$_{\\odot}$), with average sizes of 750 parsecs. Additionally, their metallicities, extinction corrected H$\\alpha$ luminosities, line ratios, and H$\\alpha$ equivalent widths implied the presence of a young stellar burst with an average age of 5-8 Myr -- characteristics consistent with those of other TDG candidates. Through assessing the structural and kinematic properties of the star-forming regions, our assessment of their survival as TDGs suggests that five out of the twelve have a high-medium or high likelihood of survival. A particular region - located in the advanced merger IRAS15250+3609 and featuring a decoupled velocity field from its parent ULIRG - is ultimately deemed our best TDG candidate."}

The results demonstrate that the dust population of the interstellar medium is primarily composed of this material accreted in molecular clouds. It is found that the dust which form the Solar System yields insignificant isotopic abundance anomalies of the refractory elements, indicating that most of the dust is not a product of the Solar System's own formation. The observed abundance ratios of presolar dust grains suggest that the fraction of refractory elements condensed into dust is about 0.15 for carbon dust and very small for most other dust species."}

We demonstrate that for large BPS black holes, the lowest order \\alpha' corrections have the same entropy, however, for non-BPS black holes, they are generally different. Furthermore, we pay special attention to the class of prepotentials connected with the K3\\times T^2 and T^6 compactifications. In the former instance, we obtain both BPS and non-BPS solutions, while in the latter (equivalent to the heterotic string on $T^4\\times S^1$) we find the almost complete set of solutions to the exception of non-BPS small black holes. We show that their entropy is distinct from the statistical entropy arriving from counting the microstates of heterotic string theory. Additionally, we acquire a complete set of solutions when the correction is given by the Gauss-Bonnet term for the two popular compactifications. Contrary to the four-dimensional picture, the obtained entropy does not match with that of the supersymmetric correction. Lastly, for the ``BPS'' small black holes, we observe that in the Gauss-Bonnet case, their entropy complies with its microscopic counterpart in known contexts. "}

With a mass of several times 10^7 solar masses, the resulting star\nformation in the stripped ISM contributes to both the ICM and the intracluster\nstellar light. All this implies that ESO 137-001 is undergoing an active\ntransformation with a build-up of its central bulge and depletion of its ISM."}
{"text":"\nThis article presents research into a hypothesis that the interstellar medium (ISM) is enriched with supernova ejecta which are condensed into metal-rich \"droplets\" that meander back onto the galactic disk andbecome photoionized within HII regions. Our analysis explores the possibility that these droplets could be responsible for the observed 'abundance discrepancy factors,' which are discrepancies between column density measurements via recombination lines and collisionally excited lines. We derive upper bounds on the size of droplets and investigate how their photoionization influences estimated abundances from each line type. We suggest that objects with large ADFs should be omitted from galactic chemical evolution studies and caution against comparing galactic abundance gradients from the two methods. Finally, we outline proposed observations which can be used to further test the proposed enrichment scenario for the ISM."}
{"text":"\nA study is conducted to analyze if ion trapping can lead to an enhancement of the stimulated Brillouin backscatter (SBS) reflectivity. Particle electromagnetic simulations and integration of three-wave coupled-mode equations with linear and nonlinear models of nonlinear ion physics are used. Electrostatic simulations of linear ion Landau damping, reductions of damping due to ion trapping as well as nonlinear frequency shifts due to ion trapping set the base for modelling SBS electromagnetic simulations. Laser intensity scans were performed using one-dimensional particle simulations and coupled-mode-equations integration with two values of electron-to-ion temperature ratio in order to vary the linear ion Landau damping. Results of the four intensity scans reveal that ion trapping might result in an inflation of SBS reflectivity."}
{"text":"This paper presents spatially-resolved near-IR interferometric observations of the gas and dust content in the terrestrial-planet-forming region of a protoplanetary disk around a young star. These observations resolve water vapour and atomic hydrogen in addition to the dust found in previous studies. The study finds that the interactions of accreting gas with migratory planets may lead to short-period exoplanets and that the observed water may provide a source of H2O for terrestrial planets."}
{"text":"\nWe present a numerical algorithm that explores the phenomenology of D-brane inflation where the speed of sound may differ significantly from the speed of light. Our calculations yield qualitative predictions of the key observables associated with this class of models, such as modified consistency relations and the potential for a large level of non-Gaussianity. We compare the qualitative shapes of higher-dimensional warp factors with those derived analytically and derive a generalized microphysical bound on the field variation during inflation. The compactification constraint in four-dimensional Planck units is found to be violated in most models that could be detectable. If the field range constraint holds, then models with detectable non-Gaussianity are predicted to have a blue scalar spectral index and a tensor component that is beneath the detection limit of any future experiment."}
{"text":"\nThe magneto-rotational instability (MRI) is a known means by which T Tauri disks accrete, yet the low ionization state of protoplanetary disks typically inhibits the activation of this process. Here, it is shown that the MRI can effectively explain observed accretion rates of a special sub-class of T Tauri disks referred to as transitional systems, whose internal dust has been blown clear by radiation pressure inside a rim radius of roughly 10 AU. Stellar coronal X-rays ionize a thin layer at the rim's outer edge, which is then susceptible to MRI-driven gas flow toward the star. The larger the rim's width, the greater the accretion rate. The powerful X-rays manage to penetrate the disk midplane, allowing for steady transport of gas inside the rim. Accretion of dust particles is hindered. Ambipolar diffusion appears to limit gas MRI-activity with an inferred transport parameter alpha of 0.01. Our model points to an environment conducive to planet-disk interaction - a stable, well-defined setting with decoupled properties sitting distinct from uncertain initial conditions. Finally, we establish a two-part role for protoplanetary disk dissipation: inner disks drain outward by MRI action, while outer disks are cleared away by the stellar ultraviolet radiation."}
{"text":"\nWe model the impact of mergers in the evolution of quasars, supermassive black holes, and elliptical galaxies. Using halo mass functions (MFs) and halo occupation models, we are able to accurately predict where galaxy mergers occur, along with their types and redshifts. Our determinations of merger MFs and small-scale environments match closely to observations. In addition, we suggest that major, gas-rich mergers may cause quasar activity, which has been shown to reproduce the luminosity densities from z=0-6, along with quasar luminosity functions, fractions, host galaxy colors, and clustering. Our results also match the small-scale clustering of quasars, due to mergers having preference for regions of excess galaxy overdensity. The environments of quasars correspond to small group scales, which is where mergers are most efficient. We contrast with a secular model, demonstrating that while these may be a contributing factor at Seyfert luminosities, the clustering (on both large and small scales), the pseudobulge populations, disk MFs, luminosity density evolution and host galaxy colors imply small contribution to the z>1 quasar luminosity."}
{"text":"\nWe demonstrate that, when performing supersymmetric compactifications of type II supergravity to four dimensions, orientifold sources can be in agreement with a generalized version of SU(3) x SU(3)-structure that is different from both strictly SU(3) and static SU(2). We provide examples of such by suitably applying T-dual transformations to an existing solution on a six-torus. Other than this, we discover that under certain basic assumptions, the Einstein and dilaton equations of motion for any type II supergravity background containing orientifold and D-brane sources can be derived from the supersymmetry equations when the form equations of motion and Bianchi identities are assumed known. In addition, for the special case of compactifications to four-dimensional Minkowski space, we observe that all the field equations, including the NSNS three-form, can be ascertained when the supersymmetry equations and Bianchi identities of the forms are employed. Both of these propositions are valid regardless of the sources being smeared or specifically concentrated. Additionally, a side effect yields the calibration form for a space-filling NS5-brane."}
{"text":"We explore a new framework of cosmological understanding, wherein the development and quenching of red early-type galaxies is greatly influenced by major mergers. By assuming path cessation of star formation is prompted by these mergers, we are able to accurately predict characteristics like the efficiency of star formation at ~L_star, and also the mass function and density of red galaxies as a function of redshift, and growth rates of spheroids as a function of mass. Through comparison of these results with various semi-analytic models in which quenching is mainly due to halo mass or other secular or disk instabilities, we deduce which models provide the best fit for a range of observable outcomes like red fraction contingent upon halo and galaxy mass, and evolutions of color morphology to density at high z's. We postulate that quenching happens via a two-fold process of transitioning to hot and massive halos, combined with the feedback of quasar activity in a major merger."}
{"text":"\nIn this article, we investigate the differences between electronic Raman scattering and photoluminescence for the characterization of a spin-polarized two-dimensional electron gas embedded in $\\text{Cd}_{1-x}\\text{Mn}_x\\text{Te}$ single quantum wells. From Raman scattering in a zero magnetic field, we measure the Fermi velocity and then calculate the Fermi energy and density. We compare these figures to photoluminescence results at moderate electron densities. However, when an in-plane magnetic field is applied, the difference in the Fermi energy becomes more pronounced. We also observe the Zeeman energy $Z$ and one electron spin-flip energy $Z^*$ in the Raman scattering spectra. The magneto-photoluminescence spectra shows conduction band splitting that are equivalent to $Z$, which suggests collective effects are present. We attribute the discrepancy in measuring the degree of spin polarization $\\zeta$ and the Fermi energy to the renormalized mass resulting from electron-electron interactions."}
{"text":"\nWe present findings from our observational follow-up of the GRB 060927, detected 20 seconds after the outburst, the earliest rest-frame detection of optical emission of any such burst. The VLT spectroscopy 13 hours after the burst detected a continuum break at lambda ~ 8070A produced by neutral hydrogen absorption at a redshift of 5.6, and a line of SiII 8158A at redshift 5.467. Our study implies that GRB afterglows resulting from a redshift greater than 6 can be detected from the ground, but rapid NIR monitoring will be necessary for successful identification. Additionally, high HI column density host galaxies at z>5 may complicate the use of GRBs for probing the reionization epoch via spectroscopy of the red damping wing. Finally, GRBs are shown to be vital in locating star forming galaxies at z>5, which offers helpful insight into the reionization of the universe."}
{"text":"\nThis research presents a class of quantum field theories that are invariant under the transformations ${\\bf C}$, ${\\bf P}$, ${\\bf T}$ and ${\\bf CPT}$, despite their nonlocal nature when developed on the Groenewold-Moyal (GM) plane. We consider theories that contain either no gauge fields, or contain both gauge fields and no matter fields. We also demonstrate that in the presence of gauge fields, it is possible to have a field theory where the Hamiltonian is symmetric under ${\\bf C}$ and ${\\bf T}$, while the $S$-matrix violates both ${\\bf P}$ and ${\\bf CPT}$. For non-abelian gauge theories with matter fields, such as the electro-weak and $QCD$ sectors of the standard model of particle physics, the ${\\bf C}$, ${\\bf P}$, ${\\bf T}$ and any pairs of them are broken, while ${\\bf CPT}$ remains intact in the case of $\\theta^{0i}=0$. When $\\theta^{0i} \\neq 0$, it also contributes to breaking both ${\\bf P} $ and ${\\bf CPT}$. It is known that the $S$-matrix in a non-abelian theory depends solely on $\\theta^{0i}$. Moreover, this $S$-matrix is frame dependent; meaning it breaks the identity component of the Lorentz group. All the noncommutative effects cease to exist when the scattering takes place in the center-of-mass frame, or any other frame where $\\theta^{0i}P^{\\textrm{in}}_{i} = 0$. By contrast, in this special case both ${\\bf P}$ and ${\\bf CPT}$ are seen to be good symmetries of the theory."}
{"text":"\nA recent survey has identified that EF Cha, a particular star within the Cha-Near Moving Group, is approximately 10 million years old and is situated close to us. By utilizing the Hipparcos dwarfs and MSX catalog, a prominent mid-infrared surplus was found with a copious emission feature generated by small warm amorphous and possibly crystalline silicate particles. This is suggestive of the presence of active planet formation occurring in an area that resembles the asteroid belt in our own Solar System. As the dust grains do not last longer than 100,000 years, it is clear that the warm surplus must be composed of second generation grains and not by primeval dust. Moreover, it has been found that this is the case for around 13% of the early type stars located in nearby young stellar associations."}

Using a junction process, two specific wormhole solutions in the (2+1) gravity formalism with negative cosmological constant are obtained.

{"text":"\nThis paper proposes a mechanism for the retention of solid, grain-sized material in protostellar disks and the eventual formation of planetesimals, preferentially occurring at the water sublimation front, or snow line. This mechanism, based on turbulence driven by the magneto-rotational instability (MRI), is rooted in the fact that the disk's column depth of the active layer is a strong function of the grain size and abundance. With a sharp increase in the grain-to-gas ratio at the snow line, the active layer reduces, resulting in a local maximum of gas surface density and pressure. The gas moves at super-Keplerian velocities, effectively stagnating the inward migration of grains and potentially promoting the growth of proto-gas-giants cores in this already denser region. This model provides a robust environment for particle retention, facilitating the formation of planetesimals."}
{"text":"The observed optical emission from short\/hard GRB 050724 and its host galaxy are presented here to constrain the physical properties of both, as well as those of the global short GRB population. The comparison of the afterglow light curve and spectrum with models suggests a low collimation level and a large energy release that is comparable to that of long GRBs. Additionally, the flare properties constrain the internal shock mechanism as needing a large Lorentz factor contrast between the colliding shells, indicating that the central engine was active at late times. The host galaxy has red colors and no present star formation, indicating old stellar population, a noteworthy case for progenitor model constraints."}
{"text":"\nRecent observations have revealed that the cooling flows in the central regions of clusters of galaxies are significantly suppressed. This suppression has been attributed to AGN-sourced gas outflows, dubbed \"cavities or bubbles\". Evidence of a substantial non-thermal particle population has been found from X-ray cavity observations as well as synchrotron emission seen in radio frequencies. Building on previous research focusing on the impact of cosmic-rays via pressures support, a new model has been developed. This proposes that the intracluster medium is heated by cosmic rays which enter through diffusion, or through the destruction of bubbles by Rayleigh-Taylor or Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities. The addition of thermal conduction is also taken into account. Through numerical simulations, an efficient suppression of such cooling catastrophes is demonstrated. The resulting cluster equilibrium has a highly reduced accretion rate and temperature with density profiles fitting current observations. Here defined Spitzer conduction suppresion factors are not necessary, unlike in the conduction-only cases. Cosmic-ray pressure and radial pressure gradients remain at acceptable levels, P_c\/P_g <~ 0.1 and dP_c\/dr <~ 0.1 \\rho g. As such, cosmic ray heating can offer a strong alternative to mechanical heating, which could gain particular empirical acceptance if GLAST's gamma-ray capabilities detect evidence of cosmic-ray particles in clusters."}
{"text":"\nWe use a unified methodology to calculate the characteristic spectral peak energy $E_{\\rm pk,obs}$ and the isotropic equivalent energy $E_{\\rm iso}$ of 218 Swift bursts detected by the BAT instrument between GRBs 041220 and 070509, including 77 events with measured redshifts. This comprehensive catalog helps to address the existence and origin of the high-energy correlations previously observed in pre-Swift observations. Our findings are that the $E_{\\rm pk,obs}$-$E_{\\rm iso}$ correlation does continue to be present in the Swift sample; however, the powerlaw relation is markedly different from the pre-Swift relation. Furthermore, the Swift sample consists of a large number of hard, subluminous GRBs, which agrees with indications from BATSE GRBs without redshifts. An explanation in terms of a detector threshold appears to explain why short-duration GRBs and low-redshift events are outliers to the correlations. Based on this, we are able to conclude that the high-energy correlations previously uncovered by Amati et al.(2002), Yonetoku et al. (2004), Firmani et al.(2006) are unlikely related to the physical properties of GRBs and, therefore, likely useless for testing cosmologies."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate the implications of gauging an SO(5) x U(1)_X bulk symmetry in a warped extra dimension with respect to radiative electroweak symmetry breaking and the Higgs field's Coleman Weinberg effective potential. We show that electroweak symmetry breaking can be achieved with appropriate generation of the top and bottom quark masses within the same region of bulk mass parameters that satisfies precision electroweak data constraints with a light Higgs. This leads to a natural Higgs mass range varying between values close to the LEP limit and about 160 GeV, which could be potentially tested at both the Tevatron and LHC. Additionally, we evaluate the KK spectrum generated in our model and discuss the phenomenology of the resulting light resonances."}
{"text":"\nThis article presents an analysis of a two-channel coupling formalism for the charge-exchange reaction with isobaric analog excitation in four different target nuclei ($^{48}$Ca, $^{90}$Zr, $^{120}$Sn and $^{208}$Pb) at the proton energies of 35 and 45 MeV. This research utilizes the Hartree-Fock-Bogoljubov nuclear ground state densities, as well as the density-dependent CDM3Y6 interaction, for the folding calculation of the nucleon optical potential and \\pn form factor. The complex isovector density dependence of the CDM3Y6 used for the analysis had been previously calibrated against the Brueckner-Hatree-Fock microscopic calculation. As such, this study serves to test the accuracy of the isovector coupling via examining the 0$^+$ isobaric analog states in $^{48}$Sc, $^{90}$Nb, $^{120}$Sb and $^{208}$Bi in the folding model analysis of the \\pn reaction. Furthermore, the isospin- and density-dependent CDM3Y6 interaction was utilized for the Hartree-Fock calculation of symmetric and asymmetric nuclear matter allowing for a realistic estimation of the nuclear symmetry energy."}

Consequently, this catalog has immense significance in evaluating analyses done with LIGO related to constraining the rate of binary coalescence under a specific astrophysical population model. Furthermore, the catalog can find application in other astronomical studies that depend on galaxy blue luminosity.

{"text":"\nWe uncover the makeup of the low-redshift intergalactic medium (IGM) in the direction of quasar PKS1302-102 (z_QSO = 0.2784) using archival HST\/STIS and FUSE ultraviolet spectra.

Additionally, we detect three tentatively OVI systems that lack associated CIII absorption. Performing CLOUDY ionization modeling, these metal-line systems have metallicities spanning -4 < [M\/H] < -0.3. Our analysis of these metal-line absorbers suggest the presence of multiple-phase, photo-ionized media which is further supported by a survey of the galaxies in the quasar field. Each metal-line system has at least one luminous galaxy within 500 km\/s and 600 h^-1 kpc of the quasar."}
{"text":"\nThis paper explores ways of extending the bicategorical notion of 'morphisms' between 0-cells to encompass other types of 1-cells, including bimodules, spans, distributors, or parametrized spectra. By employing pseudo-double categories, as well as by considering non-algebraic base changes via categorical fibrations, a new type of 'framed bicategory' is generated. This paper then describes two ways to construct framed bicategories: one that is analogous to rings and bimodules, and one that uses monoidal fibrations to generate analogues of spans. Combining the two, a mechanism is created that covers both enriched and internal categories as special cases."}

Drawing on a multi-carrier theory which includes isotropic and anisotropic exchange effects between electron-hole pairs, we can accurately determine optical transition energies and polarizations between collective, Quantum Dot orbital states. Our results enable us to clearly identify most of the observable spectral lines, particularly those arising from single, double, and triple negative excitons and bi-excitons. We observe that these lines are linearly polarized, and the direction of polarization is not restricted to crystallographic orientations but instead depends on the specific shell states of electron-hole pairs involved in the recombination process."}
{"text":"\nThis study presents a catalog of 21 cm HI clouds in the Large Magellanic Cloud derived from an interferometric survey carried out by combining HI data from the Parkes Multi-beam Survey with observations from a second HI survey.

Virial parameters of the clouds were found to all be fairly consistent but much higher than unity, indicating that turbulent motions dominate the gravitational forces in these clouds. The mass distribution of the clouds followed a power law with differential indices between -1.6 and -2.0 and the mean surface densities were found to be log-normally distributed."}
{"text":"\nThis study investigated the influence of experimental context on the development of anhedonia in male mice experiencing chronic social stress. For this purpose, a 0.2% vanillin sucrose solution was offered to male mice living in group home cages over 10 days, after which they were imposed to social stress. Similarly, the same sucrose solution was presented to males already exposed to social stress after 8 days. It was observed that males who had been familiarised with the vanillin sucrose solution prior to social defeat stress, showed preference for the solution, although it was consumed in significantly lower proportions than during the control conditions. When offered the vanillin sucrose solution after 8 days of social stress, the mice were found to consume it less frequently and in a significantly lower proportion than the control group. These observations indicate that the development of anhedonia in male mice exposed to chronic social stress is largely affected by the experimental context."}
{"text":"\nWe report on INTEGRAL X-ray spectra and X-ray\/optical light curves of GRO J1655-40, a luminous black hole X-ray transient, during its 2005 outburst. We've determined that its high energy emission can best be described by an unbroken power-law with photon indices of 1.72+-0.03 and 2.21+-0.04 in the first and second observations respectively. These designate hard and thermal states. Contrary to other black hole spectra, a break or cut-off is not needed for the hard state. We show, for the first time, that Comptonization from non-thermal electrons is the major source of the high energy output in this state. We compare our results to theoretical models for broad-band emission and accretion flows in stellar-mass black holes."}
{"text":"\nIn this article, we compare waveforms generated by post-Newtonian (PN) and numerical-relativity (NR) simulations of a low-eccentricity, equal-mass binary system.

We compare this section of the NR waveform from the second to the eighth orbit, which is 1.5 orbits pre-merger and corresponds to a gravitational-wave frequency of $M\\omega = 0.0455$ to 0.1. Depending on the method of matching PN and NR waveforms, the accumulated phase disagreement over this frequency range can be within numerical uncertainty. We also examine the amplitude discrepancy, which is around 6%, but constant for the 13 cycles, suggesting that only 4.5 orbits need to be simulated for effective matching. If the amplitude is modelled up to 2.5PN order, the amplitude disagreement is within numerical uncertainty up to 11 cycles prior to merger."}
{"text":"\nIn this article, we review different techniques to identify the fluctuations of synaptic conductance in cortical neurons and the way in which these fluctuations affect spike production. Using a simplified Gaussian-distributed point-conductance model we can analyze recordings of the membrane potential (Vm) to determine parameters that depict the synaptic conductance distributions. Additionally, the comparison of theoretical and experimental power-spectral densities can provide additional insight. Ultimately, by looking at spike-triggered averages of synaptic time-courses preceding spikes, it is possible to measure the effect of synaptic conductance variance on spike timing. To assess these methods and theories, the dynamic-clamp technique is utilized in cortical neuron cultures in vitro, as well as evaluating intracellular recordings in the cat association cortex in vivo. Through these experiments, it is suggested that inhibition has a large role to play in helping to shape neuronal dynamics."}
{"text":"\nIn this article, we investigate numerically the finite-size effects that affect the scaling behavior of roughness distributions in different interface growth models. Contrary to the usual assumption that the average roughness $<w_2>$ is a suitable scaling factor, we observe that this result is not valid for a variety of ballistic-like models in 2+1 dimensions, even when large system sizes are considered. To explain this phenomenon, we propose a scaling relation that involves the root mean square fluctuation of the roughness, which successfully collapses the data. We also find that accounting for the constant intrinsic width correction term significantly improves the scaling of $<w_2>$. Moreover, our study disproves the conventional assertion that intrinsic width originates from high surface steps by analyzing data from restricted solid-on-solid models with a range of maximal height variations between neighbor columns. Finally, we find that finite size corrections in roughness distributions are often coupled with sizable corrections in height distributions, average local slopes, and estimates of scaling exponents. As a case example, we analyze the molecular-beam epitaxy model of Das Sarma and Tamborenea in 1+1 dimensions, and find that none of the proposed scaling relations yield satisfactory results. Our findings demonstrate that roughness distributions are superior tools for determining the universality class of a growing system, though they cannot provide a definite solution."}

{"text":"\nThis study assesses two distinct models for the extraordinary gamma-ray binary LS I +61 303: those invoking particle acceleration in a wind collision between the B-star wind and a relativistic pulsar wind, and those centering on a relativistic jet powered by accretion. A 3D SPH code provides dynamical simulations corresponding to both of these models which can be used to evaluate how the models compare with the data from observations of the source in various wavebands. Results indicate that while the wind interaction front predicted by the pulsar-wind model does not match the putative \"cometary tail\" reported in radio observations, the accretion-jet model proposes a plausible explanation for the observed TeV gamma-ray emission towards apastron. Ultimately, the study suggests that the colliding-wind model is not established for LS I +61 303, while the accretion-jet model effectively reproduces the observed gamma-ray emission."}
{"text":"\nIn this article, we delve into the radio afterglow of GRB 030329 at late stages as the jet enters the non-relativistic phase. Using the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope and the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope to observe over 268-1128 days after the burst at frequencies ranging from 325 MHz to 8.4 GHz, we identify the electron energy distribution index, the energy of the blast wave and the density of the circumburst medium. Our findings, which include the blast wave being roughly spherical at t_NR and comparable energy and density to previous studies, agree with the implications derived from the VLBI studies of its image size evolution. We suggest that the Low Frequency Array might be able to further narrow down the physics of the blast wave as it enters its non-relativistic period."}

This would then allow one to obtain the complete thermodynamics of the system. We use this to demonstrate that the local density approximation holds in the thermodynamic limit, however, we note its limited use for local variables. As we complete our analysis we point to the current research involving ultracold gases as possible examples of this theory."}

These include the limitations of viscous liquids to develop structural order, the lower compressibility of glass when compared to its liquid counterpart, and the presence of shorter relaxation timescales within the alpha process. The paper also considers six additional experimental assertions concerning the behaviours of viscous liquids, and verifies that they are logically consistent with the model described."}

Using two alternative models- one utilizing a chi^2_1 distribution of primordial density and the other involving an early dark energy- it was possible to create higher levels of S-Z power. Through detailed calculations of the S-Z power spectra, cluster number counts and angular 2-point correlation function of clusters, the models\u2019 redshift distributions were compared in a self-consistent way. The results of this research may be used to assess the feasibility of producing higher levels of S-Z power and test the viability of the models with future high quality measurements."}
{"text":"This paper provides an extensive examination of f0(1370), with the primary goal of determining the existence of the particle. By re-fitting five sets of data, major dispersion effects associated with the 4pi threshold are included for the first time. This study finds that Crystal Barrel data and data from BES II both suggest the existence of a f0(1370) particle, with a visible signal greater than 8 standard deviations. Cern-Munich data regarding pi-pi scattering fits well with the inclusion of the particle. This research also determines the pi-pi width of four other particles. The conclusion of this study validates the existence of f0(1370)."}

{"text":"\nWe analyse the optical afterglow and host galaxy of GRB 040924, a gamma-ray burst of 2.4s duration. Combining our data with the existing literature, we are able to study the optical temporal and spectral characteristics of this burst, as well as determine the host galaxy redshift to be z = 0.858 +\/- 0.001. Through comparison with survey data, we find that host galaxy has properties similar to those of long GRB hosts. Also, the detected [Ne III] emission line is comparable to that of metal-poor emission line galaxies in surveys. In addition, the supernova bump accompanying this burst is comparable to long GRB supernova bumps, but is fainter. This offers further support for the idea that GRB 040924 is the result of a core-collapse of a massive star."}
{"text":"The research presented provides new insights into the frequency and characteristics of wide binary and multiple systems containing very low-mass stars and brown dwarfs identified in the Southern Hemisphere. My findings have revealed two new wide systems and established that the frequency of field wide multiples with late-type components is 5.0+\/-1.8 %, and the frequency of field wide late-type binaries with mass ratios q > 0.5 is 1.2+\/-0.9 %. This data is critical for understanding the formation history of low-mass stars and brown dwarfs. Furthermore, 76 field very-low mass dwarfs have been given proper motion measurements for the first time."}
{"text":"\nWe provide a refined set of selection criteria to select isolated galaxies and their satellites, aiming at minimizing the contamination of their environment by other group members. Our newfound catalogue suggests that regardless of morphological differences, satellite galaxies around spheroidal and disc hosts are anisotropically distributed, while those around blue disc galaxies are isotropically distributed. We hypothesize that this anisotropy results from the orientation of the visible host with its dark matter halo, anisotropic accretion from the larger scale environment, and the biased nature of satellites as tracers of the underlying dark matter subhalo population. We discuss the origin of the anisotropic satellite distribution and consider the consequences of our results."}
{"text":"\nA new sideband-separating SIS receiver has been attached to the 60-cm Radio Survey Telescope at Nobeyama, Japan, which has improved the capabilities of the telescope. This new receiver has enabled the instrument to simultaneously detect multiple molecular emission lines across the RF frequency range of 205-240 GHz. This is achieved by the development of two acousto-optical spectrometers and a telescope control system. Tests with the new system in March 2005 yielded successful readings of 12CO (J =2-1) and 13CO (J =2-1) emissions from the Orion KL. The combination of this new receiver with the telescope at Nobeyama marks the first steps towards conducting simultaneous surveys of galactic planes, as well as large-scale mapping of nearby molecular clouds."}
{"text":"\nWater is an essential component for the existence of life, having distinct qualities not present in any other substance. These characteristics are mainly due to the hydrogen bonding occurring between water molecules, which are stronger than thermal energy bonds but weaker than covalent bonds. Hydrogen bonds form a tetrahedral configuration in liquid water, expanding cluster size and reducing density. This specific feature is responsible for many physical and chemical water properties, which make it integral for life. If the hydrogen bonds were weaker, liquid water would exist only at subzero temperatures, and if they were too strong, water's structure would be glass-like. This study demonstrates that the hydrogen bond strength in water is optimally placed within a narrow range for it to serve its intended purpose as a life-sustaining agent."}
{"text":"We present an investigation of the generalization of the Costas property to functions within the continuum, such as on intervals of the reals or rationals. We demonstrate the potential to use these functions in the same applications as discrete Costas arrays. Our exploration of constructing Costas bijections on the reals allows for slight deviations from the usual arithmetic laws and leads to potential convergence of sequences of Welch Costas arrays to smooth Costas bijections if Artin's conjecture is valid. We also provide an algorithm of great generality and flexibility for the construction of a Costas fractal bijection over the rationals, though this is heavily reliant on the enumerability of the rationals."}
{"text":"\nIn this paper, we examine the connections between the little Higgs and 5d composite models which share identical symmetry structures. We adopt an ''extreme\" deconstruction which helps reduce any warped composite model to a little Higgs theory on a handful of sites. This approach aids in understanding obscure points in the original model setup. Furthermore, we find that the finiteness of the Higgs potential in 5d is generated by the same collective symmetry breaking seen in the little Higgs framework. \n\nWe then compare a 4d and a 5d model with the same symmetries to the real-world data. After reviewing the constraints imposed by the Minimal Composite Higgs (hep-ph\/0412089), we observe that it has difficulty simultaneously producing acceptable values for S, T and m_{top}. On the other hand, the Minimal Moose with custodial symmetry is viable in a relatively large area of its parameter space, with no numeric tunings required. Our results suggest that this result is generalizable to any 4d or 5d model sharing the same symmetries. This implies that the observational data constrains the theory less tightly when expressed as a little Higgs."}
{"text":"\nThe thermodynamic behavior of the Kondo necklace model in arbitrary dimensions $d$ is studied using a representation in terms of local Kondo singlet and triplet operators. Our results demonstrate that for $d\\geq 3$ there is an antiferromagnetically ordered state at finite temperatures that terminates at a quantum critical point (QCP). In two dimensions, this long range order only occurs at zero temperature. The Neel transition line varies with the distance to the QCP $|g|$ as $T_N \\propto |g|^{\\psi}$ with the shift exponent $\\psi=1\/(d-1)$. As the paramagnetic phase is entered, the spin gap is seen to follow the behavior $\\Delta\\approx \\sqrt{|g|}$ for $d \\ge 3$, matching the dynamical critical exponent $z=1$. For low temperatures (i.e. $k_BT \\ll\\Delta$ in the Kondo spin liquid phase), the thermodynamic behavior is marked by an exponential temperature dependence. On the other hand, in the regime $k_BT\\gg\\Delta$ there is a power law temperature dependence of the specific heat."}
{"text":"\nThis communication aims to identify the minimal interface width and predetermine bulk stability requirements for effective simulation of liquid-gas systems with a diffuse interface. Our study incorporates lattice Boltzmann simulations of a van der Waals gas, and gives insight into parameter ranges which enable dense ratios of more than 1000, whereas the previous belief held that simulations of such liquid-gas systems had a ceiling of a 20-ratio. Unfortunately, without satisfying these interface width and bulk stability criteria, simulations of extended interfaces can lead to a ``stuck'' lattice or an inaccurate density overshoot around the interface, resulting in a range of bulk density values and inaccurate overall densities respectively. By meeting these requirements, stable, accurate simulation results can be achieved."}
{"text":"\nThe strong coupling between atoms and light can be achieved with optical cavities, resulting in single atom experiments that exhibit the coherent atom-photon coupling rate exceeding decoherence rates. Making progress on cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED) in three dimensions has been hindered by the difficulty in trapping and cooling atoms towards the motional ground state, but has been achievable with a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). With the pairing of a new fibre-based cavity and atom chip technology, this experiment presents a simpler setup that demonstrates a strong atom-field coupling for BECs in a cavity on a chip, allowing the BEC to be positioned within the cavity and fully localized within a sole antinode of the standing-wave. Through a transmission measurement, no noticeable heating takes place for the BEC at strong coupling. The spectrum of the coupled atoms-cavity system was mapped with a wide range of atom numbers and cavity-atom detunings, demonstrating vacuum Rabi splittings exceeding 20 gigahertz and an unexpected additional splitting attributed to the atomic hyperfine structure."}
{"text":"This article examines the elastic scattering theory and its effects on electron transport in graphene. We discuss how two-dimensional massive Dirac fermions react in the presence of an axially symmetric potential and how its massless limit applies to pristine graphene. Additionally, finite mass allows us to consider symmetry breaking between two sublattices. After demonstrating how Dirac theory requires a short-distance regularization for singular potentials, the formalism is used to study scattering off a smooth, short-ranged potential. We then discuss Coulomb potential scattering, and how the Dirac theory is consistent with a point scatterer only for an effective impurity strength below 1\/2. Analyzing the scattering phase shifts, we arrive at an exact Coulomb transport cross-section based on impurity strength. Consequently, the findings can be used to assess the electrical conduction in graphene impurities."}
{"text":"\nWe conduct numerical analysis of Sugino's lattice formulation of the two-dimensional (2d) $\\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ super Yang-Mills theory (SYM), including dynamical fermions with an included pfaffian factor. Up to lattice spacings of $a = 0.5\/g$ with a fixed physical lattice size of $L = 4.0\/g$, no issues arise from complex phases or flat directions of the classical potential in our Monte Carlo simulation. Various one point Ward-Takahashi identities are tested and those implied by exact fermionic symmetry of the formulation are confirmed with accuracy. Additionally, results from tests of Ward-Takahashi identities expected only in the continuum limit may be consistent with the predicted behavior from supersymmetry. Lastly, the expectation values of renormalized, gauge-invariant bi-linear operators of scalar fields within the 2d $\\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ SYM theory are recorded."}
{"text":"This paper sets out to examine how controlling for individual heterogeneity within longitudinal models can contribute to more accurate results. It uses random effects, or mixed models, to take unmeasured individual differences into account for more accurate estimations. After examining the relationship between random effects and fixed effects estimators, the paper concludes with analysis and simulation showing that the mixed model approach can reduce the amount of bias due to uncontrolled individual differences. This general model is directed at the complexities of longitudinal student achievement, but the conclusions can be broadly applied to various types of longitudinal models."}
{"text":"\nThis paper presents an analysis of the design process and experiments conducted on the AnITA Generic Tutoring System, a stand-alone application intended to provide a generic platform for re-use of tutoring systems in any domain.

The paper details the morphing of AnITA to AnITA2, describes the two experiments conducted on the new system, and shares the results of those experiments."}
{"text":"This article examines the potential of evolutionary algorithms for mesh numbering, a crucial part of finite element methods. Through experimentation, three conclusions were drawn: first, present numerical methods can be enhanced; second, crossover operators were ineffective; third, hybridization with other methods has not been successful. A notable benefit from this method was an increase in performance of between 12 and 20% on 1545 and 5453-node meshes tested. Additionally, an interaction between selection and mutation operators was uncovered, which calls for greater examination."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate the correlations between the spin axes of 12122 nearby spiral galaxies from the Tully Galaxy Catalog and the real space tidal field derived from the Two Mass Redshift Survey (2MRS) by Erdogdu et al. in 2006. Our analysis yields evidence of intrinsic correlations between the spins of the distorted galactic disks and the intermediate axes of the computed tidal shears. This correlation significantly exceeds the significance threshold of 99.99 %. We additionally study the dependence of the alignment on the morphological type of the galaxies and their environments. Results reveal a slight decrease in correlations for later type galaxies and higher correlations for galaxies located in higher-density regions. Comparison with analytic predictions of tidal torque theory reveals quantitative agreement. Our findings imply potential use of galaxy spin orientations as a complementary probe of the dark matter distribution."}
{"text":"\nThe study of malicious singularities, which are characterized by the equivalence class $[p_0]$ maintaining close contact with all other equivalence classes, requires special methods due to the collapse of the differential structure of the space-time to a single point. In this paper, we investigate this phenomenon in a broader context of differential and structured spaces using the equivalence relation $\\rho$ defined on the Cauchy completed total space $\\bar{E}$ of the frame bundle over the space-time. We provide conditions for the occurrence of malicious singularities and outline the use of noncommutative geometry of von Neumann algebras of random operators to understand the probabilistic properties of these singularities. Our main result is that in the noncommutative regime, even the strongest singularities are indiscernible from a probabilistic point of view."}
{"text":"This paper examines the regularization properties of the free additive convolution of probability measures on the real line, and the rectangular free convolution of singular distributions on the real line. In the case of square free convolutions, we find a condition on semigroups that enable a continuous semigroup of probability measures with absolute continuity with respect to the Lebesgue measure, as well as an analytic density on the entire real line. For rectangular free convolotions, there is often an atom at the origin, preventing the expected properties, yet there are conditions for which analyticity of the density of the rectangular convolution of a measure with a probability measure can occur, as well as existence and continuity of a density."}
{"text":"\nWe present findings from multi-J CO (3-2 & 1-0) observations of a 5' $\\times$ 5' area encompassing the central star cluster of the supergiant HII region NGC 604 in the nearby spiral galaxy M 33. We show the detection of a high CO(J=3-2)\/CO(J=1-0) ratio gas arc extending in a south-east to north-west orientation with a size of $\\sim$200 pc. The arc is observed to coincide closely with H$\\alpha$ and radio continuum peaks and has a R_{3-2\/1-0} greater or equal to 1, indicating very warm (T_kin>60K) and dense (n(H_2)> 10^{3-4} cm^{-3}) molecular gas. We suggest that this high-ratio gas arc, located near the first-generation stars of NGC 604, could be the result of condensed gas formation and the initiation of second-generation star formation, triggered by stellar wind\/supernova from the central star cluster."}
{"text":"\n\nA survey of the galactic plane conducted by the INTEGRAL satellite has revealed a substantial amount of new sources emitting hard X-rays, a significant fraction of which are Cataclysmic Variables (CVs). This paper focuses on one of the discovered sources, IGR J00234+6141, and identifies it as an accreting magnetic white dwarf of intermediate polar type. Our study included a more detailed analysis of the emission from the INTEGRAL source and further optical photometric and spectroscopic data obtained in 2006. Based on the refined INTEGRAL position and the detected 564 s optical modulation, we were able to confirm the proposed optical identification. Moreover, an orbital period of 4.033 +\/- 0.005 hr was detected from the emission line modulation in the system's radial velocity. This confirms IGR J00234+6141 as a magnetic CV of intermediate polar type. It is one of the dimmest and hardest of its kind ever detected by INTEGRAL, indicating that such systems constitute a notable contribution to the high-energy background."}
{"text":"\nThis paper explores a nonlinear dynamics of infection transmission by utilizing a method called instantons which has been used to quantify the rate of adiabatic chemical reactions as a function of temperature and other system parameters. We utilize \"social temperature\" T as one of the variables to study the effects of population density and its peak values in different spatial coordinates on the spread of tuberculosis. We demonstrate how an increase in T leads to a quicker rate of infectious diseases transmission. We also show that under certain conditions, the peak values (in population density) must be equal to one and the \"social temperature\" must be low for the \"blockage\" effect of infectious diseases transmission to exist. Our results are in agreement with the observed data of tuberculosis spread in Penza region of Russia and suggest that environment \"activity\" (both in terms of social and prophylactic nature) could be a major factor in the control and prevention of infectious diseases transmission."}
{"text":"The present work focuses on the study of inflationary models characterized by a superheavy scale F-term hybrid inflation followed by an inflation at intermediate scales obtained through modular inflation. From the recent data concerning power spectrum P_R of curvature perturbation and the spectral index n_s, the restrictions on them imply a suitable restriction on the amount of e-foldings N_HI* experienced by the pivot scale k_*=0.002\/Mpc due to hybrid inflation. The rest of the e-foldings necessary to solve the horizon and flatness problems are brought about by modular inflation, with a string axion as the primary inflaton. For central values of P_R and n_s, the grand unification scale is found near 2.86 x 10^16 GeV, the relevant coupling constant is of the order 0.005-0.14, and N_HI* lies between 10 and 21.7. To obtain M_GUT, the shifted and smooth hybrid inflation cases demand N_HI*=21 and N_HI*=18 respectively."}
{"text":"\nThe exploration of a potential new physics model including a mixing between low-mass ``active'' neutrinos and heavy ones, as well as lepton flavor violation, is the focus of the present paper. Through this research, the possibility to observe effects due to these modifications in the current and upcoming neutrino oscillation experiments is investigated. To this aim, precise formulas describing oscillation probabilities in constant density matter are provided, while numerical studies of two sets of new physics parameters describing single effective heavy neutrino states are considered. The analysis encompasses two isolated energy intervals and several baselines. Moreover, a comparison between the theoretical expectations at $\\pm 2\\sigma$ and at $\\pm 3\\%$ for the current neutrino oscillation parameters is made. Findings in this research indicate that the most promising scenario to identify the presence of new physics could be to focus on oscillation channels not involving $\\nu_{e}$, $\\nu_{\\bar{e}}$, such as at ``magic'' $Neutrino Factory$ baselines at $L=3000 km$ and L=7500 km."}
{"text":"\nIn this paper, a geometric order based on the idea of Lusztig [L1] is used to construct an integral PBW-basis of type $A_1^{(1)}$ from an Auslander-Reiten quiver of the Kronecker quiver, leading to an algebraic realization of a bar-invariant basis of $\\uq2$. An algebraic construction for an integral basis of a tube in [DDX] is then used to obtain a PBW basis for the generic composition algebras of any affine symmetric type. By ordering the elements in the basis according to the dimensions of the orbit varieties and the extension varieties and making the transition matrix between the PBW-basis and a monomial basis triangular with diagonal entries equal to 1, we ultimately obtain a bar-invariant basis. Finally, an orthogonalization of the basis with the inner product yields an algebraic way to achieve the canonical bases of the quantized enveloping algebras of all symmetric affine Kac-Moody Lie algebras."}
{"text":"\nUsing four-wave mixing with ultra-fast femtosecond laser pulses, we present a method for reconstructing the vibrational quantum state of molecules in a general excited state. Our approach works in the general case of molecules that have been initially excited through thermal means. This allows us to take into account initial levels with small population whose contribution to the unknown vibrational state might be very significant. For the reconstruction, spectra are measured of the outgoing four-wave mixing pulse at different time delays of the excitation laser pulse. The method succeeds without detailed knowledge of molecular transition moments between excited states or of any of the incoming laser pulses, by using as a calibration one or more laser pulses in separate experiments. The calibration pulses must together cover the full spectral range of the excitation pulse, and each should have sufficient overlap with another pulse to popoulate two of the same levels. The method described here can be extended to other related scenarios, introducing the new concept of quantum state reconstruction through calibration pulses."}
{"text":"\nThe analysis of the various failed attempts of 'green' products to gain a market share has led us to explore how an initially economically disadvantaged item can transition to the more popular choice. We present a mathematical model to explain the competition involved in a population of consumers displaying heterogeneity. This model contains a hierarchy between products, demonstrating the consumer choice when prices are equal, and in addition rescales the prices to represent increasing returns. Our model can thus illustrate multiple scenarios of technology substitution and allow for the interpretation of market forces, from which we can make predictions about irreversible trends associated with consumer decisions as well as identifying policy changes to influence transitions."}
{"text":"\nThe MiniBooNE and LSND experiments have been found to potentially be compatible if two sterile neutrinos are incorporated into the existing three active ones. Eight mass ordering scenarios are found to be present, two of which consider the steriles being heavier than the active neutrinos and the other two suggest the opposite. The remaining four include one heavier and one lighter, respectively. Results from cosmological studies and the KATRIN and future neutrinoless double beta decay experiments provide non-oscillation observables potentially capable of discriminating between the eight cases. It has been proposed that high-energy astrophysical neutrinos could decouple the mass orderings in a two-sterile neutrino configuration. All this is discussed, and our paper also considers three-sterile neutrino scenarios."}
{"text":"\nThe Galois group $Gal(\\bar{\\Q}\/\\Q)$ acts faithfully on the set of connected components of the moduli spaces of surfaces of general type. Furthermore, any element $\\sigma \\in Gal(\\bar{\\Q}\/\\Q)$ distinct from the identity and complex conjugation corresponds to a surface of general type such that its and its Galois conjugate's fundamental groups are non-isomorphic. Robert Easton and Ravi Vakil (\\cite{e-v}) published a pre-print proving that the same holds for the set of irreducible components of these moduli spaces of surfaces of general type. We also provide simpler examples of surfaces which have non-isomorphic fundamental groups yet are Galois conjugates and have analogous algebraic fundamental groups. The result was first proposed by the second author in the Alghero Conference titled 'Topology of Algebraic Varieties' in September 2006."}
{"text":"  We present a new geometric framework for understanding the representation and encoding of an Iterated Function System (IFS) using digit sets and matrices over $\\bz$ in $d$ real dimensions. In particular, we demonstrate how an IFS based on a given $(A,\\mathcal D)$ can be encoded numerically, with a positional number system corresponding to a bijective correspondence with the points in $\\bz^d\/A^T\\bz^d$. We also show that the resulting attractor for the IFS, $X(A^T,\\mathcal D)$, is a set of fractions that correspond to digital representations of points in $\\br^d$. Additionally, using cycles in $\\bz^d$ associated with the initial $(A,\\mathcal D)$-IFS, we provide an IFS-encoding of a compact solenoid $\\sa$ and provide formulas for two maps which do the encoding as well as the decoding in the positional $\\mathcal D$-representation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that some wavelet representations can be realized on the solenoid and on symbolic spaces."}
{"text":"\nIn this study, the influence of trehalose, maltose and sucrose on certain structural and dynamic properties of lysozyme have been analyzed using molecular dynamics simulations over a range of 37-60 wt % concentrations. Results indicate that sugars have a mild effect on the protein conformation, which is consistent with lysozyme's preferential hydration. On the other hand, sugar-induced activity of lysozyme is found to be substantial, with sugar-related increases in protein relaxation times correlated to fractional solvent accessibilities of relevant residues. Such effects are putatively attributed to the establishment of a hydrogen-bond network among sugar molecules, which raises relaxation times of lysozyme, sugars and water."}
{"text":"\nA detailed analysis of finite-time stability exponents in the standard map has been carried out in order to detect the presence of very small islands of regular motion in the phase space. Through the use of cumulants, it has been shown that the variance and higher cumulants of the exponent are particularly effective in this purpose. This is mainly because these cumulants contain information about dynamical correlations and not the interaction strength. It has further been demonstrated that the inverse trace of the stability matrix is even more efficient in detecting small islands and that it exhibits a seemingly fractal behavior in the standard map parameter. In addition, a local approximation to the trace of the stability matrix has been proposed, which significantly simplifies numerical calculations and enables application of the methods to higher dimensions."}
{"text":"\nIn this paper, we examine the impact of a time delay on the performance of a feedback control ratchet in which the center-of-mass velocity is maximized using instantaneous feedback. Using one or multiple particles, our results show that for delayed feedback systems, the flux is reduced due to the disconnect between the present system state and the feedback employed. We also find that, when a large delay is in effect, the performance of the delayed feedback ratchet may be improved when compared to its open-loop counterpart; this is due to the stabilization of a unique, quasiperiodic solution or a multiple solution regime. Our analytical and numerical findings suggest that a feedback controlled ratchet with a time delay could be used to obtain better results than its open-loop version."}
{"text":"This work analyzes X-ray flares in 165 low-mass pre-main sequence stars in the Orion Nebula Cluster using theorights and methods of the Chandra Orion Ultradeep project. Maximum likelihood piece-wise representation of the observed X-ray light curves allows us to detect flares by considering both their amplitude and time derivative. We derive the frequency and energy distribution of the flares and find the high energy tail follows a power-law with index 2.2. Synthetic light curves made from the model match the observed data, suggesting the light curves are built from a population of overlapping flares with a single power law energy distribution. Comparing low and solar mass stars, we find at ~1 Myr, similar X-ray luminosities have similar flare frequencies. This supports a model in which the observed light curves are derived from overlapping flares with a power-law intensity distribution and a characteristic level from weak flares merged together."}
{"text":"\nAn analysis of data from three enzyme-catalyzed reactions (lactic dehydrogenase \/ pyruvate, lactic dehydrogenase \/ lactate and malic dehydrogenase \/ malate) showed an activation free energy change in the range of -329 to -221 cal\/mole associated with time-specific irradiation of the crystalline substrates prior to dissolution and incorporation into the reaction mixture. The energy presumably represents changes in the conformation or vibration of the reactants of the activated complex. Assuming that 10% of the irradiation energy was consumed during the pyruvate reaction, the results suggest that the observed rate increase is due to photoproducts derived from gas oscillations on the crystalline enzyme substrate surface, and not necessarily due to photo-excitation of the substrate molecules."}
{"text":"\nIn this paper, we present the results of the observations of the stellar-mass black hole Cygnus X-1 in the very high energy (VHE, E_gamma > 100 GeV) gamma-ray band. The observations were conducted with the MAGIC telescope over 26 nights between June and November 2006 for a total of 40 hours. Although overall no significant gamma-ray signals were identified, a 4.0 standard deviations (sigma) significance level (3.2 sigma after trial correction) for 154 minutes effective on-time (EOT) was observed on September 24th between 20h58 and 23h41 UTC, coinciding with an X-ray flare documented by RXTE, Swift and INTEGRAL. Furthermore, 79 minutes EOT during this period provided excess with a significance of 4.9 sigma (4.1 sigma after trial correction). The measured excess matches a point-like source at the position of Cygnus X-1, indicating a potential emission of VHE radiation from this stellar-mass black hole system. The differential energy spectrum agrees with an unbroken power-law with a rate of dN\/(dA dt dE) = (2.3+- 0.6) x 10^{-12} (E\/1 TeV)^{-3.2 +- 0.6}. These findings provide the first evidence of VHE gamma-rays from a confirmed accreting X-ray binary."}
{"text":"\nIn this work, we characterize the scaling laws of soliton pulse compression when it is realized by phase-mismatched second-harmonic generation (SHG) with a bulk quadratic nonlinear material. Specifically, the equations of temporal propagation and the competition of the effects of SHG and nonlinear self-phase modulation (Kerr effect) together regulate the successful compression. We identify a critical phase mismatch above which compression fails, as well as a critical effective soliton number linked to the balance between the SHG and Kerr numbers. By simulating picosecond pulses in $\\beta$-barium borate crystals, we establish the scaling laws governing effective soliton number and show that compressed pulses of single-optical cycle or lower can be sustained."}
{"text":"\nWe explore the emission of Aromatic Infrared Bands (AIBs) across the illuminated edge of the Horsehead nebula, especially their existence and characteristics in the HII region. Our study includes spectral mapping conducted with the Infrared Spectrograph at wavelengths of 5.2 - 38 microns. An intense AIB of 11.3 microns is detected in the HII region compared to the other AIBs at 6.2, 7.7, and 8.6 microns. The intensity of this particular band appears to correlate with the intensity of [NeII] at 12.8 microns and Halpha, which implies the emitter of the 11.3 micron band is located within the ionised gas. This finding could be accounted for by the average-intensity radiation field (G0 about 100) and little photons of energy over 25eV. We reason the intensification of the 11.3 micron band in the HII region relative to the other AIBs could stem from the availability of neutral PAHs. Our observations highlight a transitory area between ionised and neutral PAHs witnessed in our Galaxy under proper conditions. A scenario in which PAHs can survive in HII regions and substantially remain neutral could explain the noticeable 11.3 micron band noticed in many other Spitzer observations."}
{"text":"\nCan a gravastar be distinguished from a black hole of the same mass? We explore the answer to this question by constructing a general class of gravastars and systematically analyzing the stability of these objects against axial perturbations. Comparing the quasi-normal modes of both objects reveals a unique signature of a gravastar, thus enabling observers to conclusively distinguish the two objects of same mass. We additionally identify the conditions a given gravastar must satisfy in order to exist as an equilibrium solution of the Einstein equations."}
{"text":"This paper presents observations conducted on the afterglow of GRB051022, as well as modelling of the X-ray and radio data to determine the physical parameters of the burst and detect the amount of extinction responsible for the faintness of the optical afterglow. The findings suggest an extinction of at least 2.3 magnitudes in the infrared range and 5.4 magnitudes in the optical range, which is unusual for GRBs and could be attributed to a geometrical effect where our view of the burst is clouded by dust in the host, independent of the burst itself. Analysis of the radio and X-ray data yielded an afterglow energetics orderless than that of the prompt emission."}
{"text":"This paper presents a novel approach for evaluating the size of the critical nucleus and the surface tension in systems that exhibit a first order phase transition. Our technique is based on the thermodynamics of a sphere of given radius encapsulated in a frozen metastable surrounding, and the exterior pinning field that it creates remains until the radius of the sphere is larger than the critical nucleus' size. We have tested our method in two systems under two different parameters - the magnetic field and temperature, both in a two-dimensional lattice - where we obtained satisfactory results. One advantage of our method is that it does not need an infinite volume limit to be accurate, since it obtains reliable results even in relatively small systems. On the contrary, it cannot be used at or close to the critical point, since the critical nucleus would become infinitely large at this stage."}
{"text":"\nThe dynamics of a horizontally vibrated bidisperse granular monolayer is analyzed in an experimental setting. Through a quick process of energy dissipation, a rigid structure and contact dynamics are produced as macroscopic rigidity is achieved. It is revealed that this transition between jammed and unjammed is a critical phenomenon, with increasing collective and heterogeneous rearrangement of components at length scales much smaller than the size of the grain particles. Results show that a very narrow range of volume fraction ($\\delta \\phi\/\\phi \\sim 10^{-3}$) can lead to a remarkable boost in dynamical correlation time and length scales. Further analysis of individual grain movements suggests superdiffusion at the jamming density $\\phi_J$. Also, the system displays critical scaling of four-point dynamical correlations in space at the same transition density."}
{"text":"\nThis study aims to shed light on the origin of the stellar initial mass function by analyzing the movements of starless condensations and protostars previously detected in the L1688 protocluster of the Ophiuchus molecular cloud complex. IRAM 30m telescope observations were used to measure velocity variations both within the condensations and between them, finding subsonic or at most transonic levels of internal turbulence, viral masses similar to those derived from the 1.2mm dust continuum, and a global one-dimensional velocity dispersion of less than 0.4 km\/s. Such small relative velocity dispersion implies limited time for condensations to interact with one another prior to developing into pre-main sequence objects. Our findings support the idea that the IMF is partly shaped by cloud fragmentation at the prestellar stage, without computative accretion playing a major role in the protostellar stage of the Ophiuchus protocluster, though it may be a factor in the evolution of self-gravitating condensations toward a Salpeter-like mass spectrum."}
{"text":"This paper describes a new technique for monitoring the performance of the Large Area Telescope (LAT) instrument on board the Gamma-ray Large Area Space Telescope (GLAST) satellite. The LAT instrument consists of 16 towers in a four-by-four grid containing a pair conversion tracker, a hodoscopic crystal calorimeter, and a segmented plastic scintillator anti-coincidence shield. In order to ensure that the LAT performs optimally and that any potential problems with the instrument can be promptly located and addressed, this paper outlines a method using the power of classification trees to accurately identify any potential issues with the recorded data. The technique described in this article also provides insight into the effect of potential instrumental problems on the overall LAT performance."}
{"text":"This article focuses on two-loop corrections for nuclear matter in the context of\na covariant effective field theory. The loop expansion is used with the Infrared\nRegularization technique to separate out short- and long-range contributions.\nThe parameters implicitly account for short-range interactions, so the\nremaining contributions must be calculated explicitly. Calculations are\nperformed to study the effects of two-loop corrections at finite densities,\nwhich are then used to check the naturalness of the parameters when applied to\nthe properties of equilibrium nuclear matter."}
{"text":"\nThis paper investigates the apparent contradiction between numerical simulations that suggest large recoil velocities could potentially expel black holes from galaxies, and observations indicating that most galaxies contain supermassive black holes. Using a simplified merger tree model and a Monte Carlo model, we show there is still an appreciable fraction (>50%) of galaxies with supermassive black holes even with very high black hole ejection probabilities. Additionally, we argue that including realistic physics should systematically increase this retention fraction, further reconciling theory and observation. Our results provide estimates of black hole occupation fractions as a function of galactic velocity dispersion."}
{"text":"\nWe develop a chain-boson model to analyze the decoherence and relaxation of a chain of SQUIDs coupled into a chain and influenced by a phonon bath. With the four generators from the associated master equation, we analyze how the system is affected by the energy-level crossings, entangled states and two-way resonant transitions in the Heisenberg SQUID chain. We note that energy-level crossings can decrease certain relaxation and decoherence rates due to the interactions of the SQUIDs collectively with the environment. Furthermore, the transitions into entangled states are independent of the SQUIDs coupling with the bath, and we identify that decaying oscillations can emerge from the two-way resonant transitions."}
{"text":"\nThis paper investigates the phenomenon of galactic disc warps due to the interaction of intergalactic accretion flows with the disc. It is argued that these flows transmit momentum, in form of a torque, to the disc which gives an integral-sign-shaped warp. Calculations have shown that, even for relatively low flow velocities (~100 km\/s) and densities (~10^(-25) kg\/m^3) of the intergalactic medium, the generated torque is enough to explain the observed warps. Moreover, the rate of inflow of matter to the disc that this mechanism predicts is in agreement with the quantitative predictions of chemical evolution, notably resolving the G-dwarf problem. Furthermore, Sanchez-Salcedo (2006) proposes that this mechanism be supported due to the dependence of the disc scaleheight on the Galactocentric azimuth in the outer disc, which is actually observed."}
{"text":"\nBy analyzing RXTE data, we investigate the spectral and temporal properties of the low-mass X-ray binary 4U 1728-34 as its low- QPO frequency ranges from 6 to 94 Hz. As the QPO frequency increases, the source transitions from its island to its banana state. Our Fourier-resolved spectroscopy reveals that the banana states' spectra are well fitted by a single black body component with $kT \\sim 2-3$ keV. This suggests that this component originates from the boundary layer, and is in agreement with similar behavior seen in the Z sources. The iron line at $\\sim$6.6 keV, visible in the averaged spectrum, disappears in the frequency-resolved spectra, suggesting that it has little variability on timescales of $10^{-2}-10^2$s. In the island state, no single model seems to adequately fit the spectra, though an absorbed powerlaw model or an additive blackbody plus hard powerlaw model may suffice."}
{"text":"\nWe analyze the geometric properties of bipartite pure state entanglement of $(2\\times{D})$- and $(3\\times{D})$-dimensional quantum systems when acted upon by single-qubit and single-qutrit local unitary transformations. Our research reveals that the invariance of states under the said transformations is a necessary and sufficient condition for separability. Furthermore, the computation of the von Neumann entropy of entanglement for the $(2\\times{D})$-dimensional case is a monotonic function of the squared Euclidean distance between states and their images. In both cases, both linear entropy and tangle measure (for $(2\\times{D})$-dimensional case) are found to be exact representations of the squared Euclidean distance. We discuss the implications of this formalism and its applications to quantum critical phenomena in spin systems."}
{"text":"\nUsing Swift's observations of gamma ray bursts (GRBs), it was discovered that many of them contained X-ray flares, which led to the hypothesis that they may be related to the internal engine that fueled the GRB's initial emission. This paper has analyzed the X-ray flares from the first 110 GRBs observed by Swift, detecting 33 GRBs with significant flares and a total of 77 flares above a 3$\\sigma$ level. Spectral fittings of each individual flare suggest that a Band function model is favored in some cases, suggesting a similarity in nature to the prompt GRB emission. The average fluence of the flares was found to be 2.4e-7 erg\/cm^2\/s in the 0.2-10 keV energy band. When combined with the results from a companion paper on the temporal properties of flares, it appears to be more likely that X-ray flares are due to late-time activity of the GRB's internal engine, and not related to the afterglow."}
{"text":"\nThis research develops a multiscale model to investigate the spread of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) within a simulated microenvironment. The EGFR-ERK pathway was replicated in the model at the molecular level. Molecular responses were then linked to cellular behavior, allowing the simulated cells to respond to changes in the surrounding environment. Results showed that greater amounts of growth factor could promote aggressiveness, and a small increase in the amount of available growth factor might have caused a switch in the cell's behavior from proliferative to migratory. We discovered that a strong influence from the environment can lead to more successful EGFR-ERK signaling and create a rapid expansion of NSCLC."}
{"text":"\nThe Pierre Auger Observatory has been employed to accurately evaluate composition-sensitive parameters relating to ultra-high energy cosmic rays. Combining various mass-sensitive observables, including signal risetime of the Cherenkov stations, curvature of the shower front, muon-to-electromagnetic ratio and azimuthal signal asymmetry, it was possible to analyse and differentiate between photons, neutrinos and nuclei. The risetime and curvature were primarily related to the energy and mass of the primary, while the muon content was shown to depend on the energy and number of nucleons of the shower. Asymmetry around the core was seen to be affected by geometric effects and attenuation, which are both dependent on the primary mass. The results demonstrate the efficacy of these parameters to measure mass composition separating different components of cosmic rays."}
{"text":"\nThis thesis examines an approach to the Inverse Problem, which consists of attempting to deduce the underlying microscopic theory from experimental data and to clarify this connection. In particular, it utilizes string \/ $M$ theories, which can potentially be tied to the electroweak scale, and studies patterns of observables in data obtained from the Large Hadron Collider that are sensitive to these theoretical constructions. In addition to attempting to identify properties of the underlying theoretical model from data, the thesis also highlights the importance of examining microscopic theoretical structures in order to better understand how they may connect to particle physics at the electroweak scale. The results of the thesis provide insight that can be used to approach the problem of connecting Standard Model data to microscopic theories, and will be useful in finding potential solutions to the Inverse Problem."}
{"text":"\nUsing a thermal model, we investigate the rate at which transitions between de Sitter vacua occur, leading to a Coleman-De Luccia prescription. Our interpretation of the bounce generated by this method offers an alternative prediction for the evolution of the system after it has tunneled. This interpretation suggests that all configurations contained within the static patch leading to the initial and final states of the tunneling process adhere to the bounce solution. The configurations before and after tunneling are halves of a given slice through its center. We concentrate on the case where the matter fields have no effect on the metric, but nevertheless assume that the results may be transferred to more general cases. Finally, we briefly touch upon the idea of tunneling between anti-de Sitter vacua."}
{"text":"\nWe make use of wavelet transforms to show how a critical interface model is able to describe Barkhausen noise in soft ferromagnets. For this purpose, the two-dimensional version of the model is used, in the adiabatic limit of slow driving. We observe that when the length scale is shorter than a crossover length, the effective interface roughness exponent $\\zeta$ is near 1.20, close to the expected value for the Edwards-Wilkinson model. Our analysis suggests that the waiting times between avalanches are uncorrelated, as demonstrated by the white noise scaling of the wavelet transform of their autocorrelations. Moreover, size-size correlations with the data detrended also lead to a white-noise wavelet transform. Finite driving rates which remain within the intermittent regime, show a scaling of $1\/f^{1.5}$ of the wavelet transform of correlations for intermediate frequencies. This can be determined to be caused by intra-avalanche correlations."}
{"text":"\nWe explore the formation of cosmic strings by trapping a stochastic magnetic field inside flux tubes in a numerical simulation. To achieve this, the potential is minimized when the flow of flux through every surface of the simulation lattice is a multiple of the fundamental flux quantum. When commencing with the typical number of flux quanta in a correlation-length-sized region of approximately 1, a formed string network had seen similarity to that of the Kibble-Zurek Mechanism. When the initial flux rate per correlation length is amplified, the loop distribution and the Brownian shape of the continuous strings persists, although the length portion of the infinite strings is raised. Also, viewing a two dimensional slice of the network, strings are seen arranged in bundles facing in the same direction as in past 2D simulations. Our finding \u2013 which differs from before \u2013 is that when viewed in 3D, strings tied in the same bundle do not stay connected following the correlation length. When lowering the rate of the initial flux per correlation length, the dissipation of the infinite strings occur, a situation reminiscent of the Hagedorn transition."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate the structure of the Magellanic Stream (MS) using the Leiden-Argentine-Bonn (LAB) all-sky HI survey, which reveals two distinct filaments in the MS in terms of both position and velocity. We can trace parts of the Leading Arm (LA) back to the SouthEast HI Overdensity (SEHO) in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), demonstrating that at least half of the trailing Stream and most of the LA originate in the LMC. The two MS filaments show regular, oscillatory patterns of spatial and velocity variation that could be a result of the LMC's rotation curve, suggesting a drift rate of ~49 km\/s and age of ~1.74 Gyr. Additionally, high-resolution HI data of the LMC highlights the presence of supergiant shells in the SEHO, indicating gas outflows that could help form the LA and LMC filament of the MS. Thus, blowout of the LMC's gas may be a significant force in the creation of the MS and LA."}
{"text":"\nThis article explores the interplay between integrable systems and complex geometry. We begin by revising classical findings about integrable systems and explicating the Lax representation which describes them. Subsequently, a Lie algebra theoretical approach to integration of systems is applied to various problems. Following this, the concept of algebraic complete integrability (a.c.i.) of hamiltonian systems is discussed. Through this, it is explained how to determine the a.c.i. of a system and representative examples are presented. Lastly, a generalised a.c.i. that forms a covering of abelian varieties is analysed. The related complex flows are then examined in terms of the resulting invariant manifold."}
{"text":" This study aims to determine the accuracy of photometric redshifts of luminous red galaxies (LRGs) and clusters using only three bands ({\\it gri}) drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Using the $(g-i)$ color as an identifier, it is possible to estimate redshifts with accuracies of $\\sigma=0.027$ for LRGs at $z \\le 0.55$ and $\\sigma = 0.024$ for clusters at $z \\le 0.30$. I also evaluate a photometric redshifts approach independent of cluster selection technique and applicable to different wavelengths providing comparable accuracy to other established techniques. Finally the photometric redshift relation is applied to cluster candidates found in other surveys, validating the application of this method."}
{"text":"\nUsing radio interferometric 21-cm synthesis observations, we have further investigated VIRGOHI 21, which may be a dark galaxy located in the Virgo Cluster. Analysis of the data reveals a possible edge-on, spinning disk with a mass and diameter characteristic of a typical spiral galaxy. Furthermore, evidence suggests it has interacted with the luminous spiral NGC 4254, which has an unusual one-arm morphology. Our Hubble Space Telescope search for stars associated with the HI shows no such items, further pointing to VIRGOHI 21 as a likely dark galaxy with approximately 10^11 solar masses."}
{"text":"\nThis article provides a novel approach in considering the impacts of uncertainty in computed dose distributions within radiotherapy planning. A probabilistic approach is employed and a new dose-expected volume histogram is proposed that accounts for the possibility of various sources of uncertainty as they pertain to treatment planning algorithms, measurements, data modelling and so forth. A rectangular probability distribution model is established and a corresponding relationship is established to aid practical calculations. The efficacy of the proposed method is demonstrated via the evaluation of varied patient populations, and the results shed light on the affects of dose calculation uncertainty with respect to the coverage of PTV and, to some degree, for doses to organs at risk. By applying this novel method, it is possible to better quantify these effects."}
{"text":"This article describes an approach to the construction of a group catalogue based on the SDSS Data Release 5. A modified friends-of-friends (FoF) method is adopted to search for groups of galaxies, which is found to effectively track the supercluster network. Careful consideration is given to selection effects arising from the use of a magnitude-limited sample, by testing the luminosity-density relation in observed groups. The scaling law varies depending on the group's distance from the observer, with a slowly growing relationship when nearby, and a downward turn in the redshift range of 0.12-0.2. By applying weights when calculating luminosities, the groups in the catalogue can be used for assessing the large-scale luminosity-density field. The complete catalogue is available online."}
{"text":"\nThis study presents an exploration of the connections between the X-ray spectral and timing characteristics exhibited by the neutron star source Cyg X-2. Utilizing observations obtained with the RXTE satellite, we find correlations between the spectral power-law index and the low-frequency quasiperiodic oscillations in this source. Our analysis indicates that the Thomson optical depth of the Compton cloud to be in the range of 4-6, potentially obscuring the neutron star surface. This can explain why high frequency pulsations are potentially suppressed. Furthermore, certain similarities were noted between Cyg X-2 and another neutron star source, Sco X-1, in terms of their spectral and timing characteristics."}
{"text":"\nThis research addresses a novel challenge to the cold dark matter (CDM) cosmology posed by the recently studied large-scale structure of Ly\\alpha Emitters (LAEs). These findings indicate an extensive structure extending more than 50 Mpc at redshift z=3.1 and a striking weakness in the angular correlation they form. Such characteristics of LAEs appear to challenge the commonly accepted CDM-guided model of galaxy formation. To investigate the possibility that LAEs are short-lived events, we construct an alternative structure of LAEs to match the CDM cosmology. Through simulations, we discover that with a lifetime of only (6.7 \u00b1 0.6) x 10^7 yr, LAEs at z=3.1 inhabit regions of low density, distinct from the CDM-inferred understanding of galaxy formation. Further, we make a prediction for the angular correlations of LAEs at redshifts > 3, and theorize that this prediction will diverge from the CDM-based formation model even at redshifts between 4 and 6."}
{"text":"\nThe novel use of graphene nanostructures has allowed scientists to observe and study spin conduction in new, exciting ways. Through non-local four-probe experiments, researchers have seen a unique, clearly observable switch and sign reversal of the non-local resistance at the coercive field of specific ferromagnetic Permalloy electrodes. Additionally, quasi-periodic Fabry-Perot-like oscillations, signifying quantum-coherent transport, have been observed in the resistance signal up to temperatures of 300 Kelvin. This unprecedented use of graphene has opened up a multitude of possibilities for exploring exotic electronic states, such as the quantum Hall and quantum spin Hall states, and spin-polarized edge states in graphene ribbons."}
{"text":"\nThis paper explores the double-differential cross-section for the production of charged pions generated when protons of momentum between 3 \\GeVc and 12 \\GeVc collide with a tantalum target of 5% nuclear interaction length. The 2002 data was collected with the HARP detector for the T9 line of the CERN PS, with tracks, momentum and particle identification conducted by measurements from the small-radius cylindrical time projection chamber (TPC) located in a solenoidal magnet. Results are displayed for four incident proton beam momenta, and for the generated pion yield coinciding with a neutrino factory design. Through these results, most systematic discrepancies between pion production and different beam momentum, as well as between positive and negative pions, are reduced."}
{"text":"\nWe describe the discovery of 11 T dwarfs, ranging in near-infrared spectral classifications from T2 to T8. One of these T dwarfs, 2MASS J13243559+6358284, may be a binary system or very young (< 300Mya), due to its peculiar spectral characteristics. All 11 of these T dwarfs are nearby, with 1 lying within 10pc and 8 others within 25pc from Earth, further contributing to the increasing census of T dwarfs in the 25 parsec vicinity by approx. 14%. These T dwarfs provide an excellent opportunity for the exploration of closer separations for companions, than would be possible for T dwarfs located further away."}
{"text":"\nWe consider phase transitions in two dimensional XY systems which are coupled with spatial anisotropy, and\nexhibit $U(1) \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry.

{"text":"\nThis research gives an explanation for the emergence, sustained maintenance, and eventual cessation of short-term persistent activity in neural networks by using a biophysically tractable model. Specifically, we studied the features of reverberatory activity observed in small networks of cultured hippocampal neurons, such as the presence of polysynaptic current clusters, the amount of time in between clusters and the average length of the reverberations when faced with changes in the extra-cellular composition. We suggest that persistent reverberatory activity is supported by asynchronous neurotransmitter release triggered by action-potential dependent residual presynaptic calcium. Additionally, we found that rapid synaptic depression is the reason for oscillatory network activation during reverberation and slow time-scale depression is the cause of their termination. Our model allowed us to make multiple testable predictions that were successfully verified by further experiments."}
{"text":"\nIn this paper we study the behavior of $K$ non-cooperative schedulers regarding multiple applications running on a heterogeneous platform. We focus on single-level master-worker systems, comprised of independent tasks with the same computation and communication requirements but varying between each application. Our abstract examines the equilibrium achieved by the schedulers, each of whom are attempting to optimize their throughput separately. We find efficient and well-performing systems in a Pareto sense, as well as those that are lacklustre due to the absence of a Braess paradox."}
{"text":"This study focuses on the source and investigation of solar torsional oscillations, as well as extensions of them to other solar-like stars. A mathematical model is proposed to evaluate the transport of angular momentum inside the convection zone. Applying this method to the Sun, data is gathered regarding the magnitude, location, and intensity of the perturbing forces causing the variability in surface rotation rate. In addition, similar conditions of solar-like stars are also considered. Results from the model are then used to estimate the amplitude and phase relationship of poloidal and toroidal field components resulting from the mean-field Lorentz force. In cases of both the Sun and solar-like stars, the proposed model can be used to assess the magnitude and position of the torsional oscillations identified."}
{"text":"\nA detailed analysis of soft repulsive-sphere binary mixtures has been conducted, wherein the depletion force between large spheres is calculated as a function of varying density and temperature of the small spheres. Results suggest an unexpectedly strong attractive potential between the big spheres, even in the absence of hard-sphere collision. This could lead to substantial alterations in the phase behavior and structure of a mixture - a perturbative scheme was applied to predict the phase diagram of an associated effective system of large spheres and surprisingly, the metastable liquid-fluid transition applicable to hard-sphere mixtures was found to be almost stable against direct liquid-solid coexistence. We discuss implictions of our findings for real colloidal dispersions."}
{"text":"  This paper presents a new technique for analyzing the delays of delay\ndifferential equations with the goal of the delay resulting in an imaginary\neigenvalue. To achieve this, a quadratic eigenvalue problem is created and when\nmultiples of a delay are involved, a polynomial eigenvalue problem.

{"text":"\nThis paper investigates the behaviour of a diffusive superconductor-ferromagnet-superconductor (SFS) junction with in-plane ferromagnetic domains. We employ the linearized Usadel equations to examine the proximity effect close to the superconducting transition temperature. Our results demonstrate that the properties of the junction depend on the size of the domains in comparison to the magnetic coherence length. When the domains are large, the junction can transition into the $\\pi$ state, which is analogous to a single domain SFS junction. Conversely, in the event of small domains, an effective spin-flip event is generated and the junction is consistently in the zero state, similar to an SNS junction. We also assess the inequalities in the local current density distributions throughout the junction and find that close to 0-\u03c0 transitions, the topology of the critical current is reversed in different parts of the junction."}
{"text":"\nThe current study focuses on the chemistry of the circumstellar envelopes that surround two of the rare and luminous yellow hypergiant stars (YHGs): IRC+10420 and AFGL2343. We consider the ratios of the intensities of various molecular transitions as well as the estimated abundances in both the YHGs and compare it to those found in O-rich and C-rich AGB stars and protoplanetary nebulae. From our single-dish observations for twelve molecular species, we have found that these two YHGs have an O-rich chemistry that is similar to that of O-rich AGB stars. However, the line intensities of most molecules are relatively weak in AFGL2343 than in 13CO lines, and the line intensity corrected for distance and profile widths are high in YHGs compared to the evolved sources. Moreover, the observed abundances for IRC+ 10420 correspond with those found in AGB stars whereas AFGL2343 has lower concentrations of these molecules, except for 13CO. This can possibly be attributed to the fact that these molecules are present only in the inner parts of the shell, where the mass is lower."}
{"text":"\nThe present work investigates the dynamics and resulting score distributions of three-agent games, where an individual player wins and scores a point after each competition. A competition is specifically described by three parameters: $p$, $t$ and $q$, which indicate the probabilities of the team with the highest, middle or lowest score winning. We observe six qualitatively different asymptotic score distributions in the large number of agents\/competitions regime and provide an expansive qualitative explanation for such results. Numerical simulations of the microscopic model are used to validate the analytical results, giving excellent agreement. This game can be seen as a social model, wherein players can be favoured or disfavoured for advancement based on their accrued scores. It is determined that a mini tournament of two-agent challenges can be used to determine the outcome of the three-agent game and that the possible score distributions generated are a subset of the broader two agent results. Finally, a steady and democratic decline rate is added to the model, with a simple geometric construction capable of writing down the corresponding score evolution equations for $n$-agent games."}
{"text":"\nIn this article we assess the effects of stellar surface structures on ultra-high-precision astrometry and examine the resulting astrometric jitter, photometric and radial-velocity effects for different types of stars. Using theoretical considerations supported by Monte Carlo simulations, we found that astrometric jitter due to stellar surface structures is usually greater than 10 micro-AU, which is larger than the astrometric displacement posed by an Earth-sized exoplanet in the habitable zone (1-4 micro-AU). We concluded that stellar surface structure may adversely impact astrometric exoplanet detection, but it has only a minimal impact on the detection of larger planets or determining stellar parallax and proper motion. Moreover, our results suggest that spot filling factor is not the best metric for measuring various astrometric, photometric, and radial-velocity variations related to stellar surface structures."}
{"text":"\nWe have looked into the probability and effects of dynamically captivating millisecond pulsars (MSPs) around intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) inside globular clusters. The capturing process of MSPs with single or binary IMBHs has been explored and analyzed with simulations of single-binary and binary-binary encounters. Our study found that IMBH and MSP binaries are formed over a period of time in a cluster due to distant orbiting binary MSPs, and further interactions of MSPs with single or binary IMBHs. The formation of the [IMBH,MSP] system is hindered when the IMBH is orbited by a stellar-mass black hole. However, due to gravitational wave emission, the created [IMBH,MSP] binaries usually only survive for about $10^{8-9}$ yr. The probability of detection of a [IMBH,MSP] system considering the current abundance of MSPs in GCs is very low. Nevertheless, if modern radio telescopes such as SKA detect a greater amount of MSPs in GCs, it is forecasted that at least one [IMBH,MSP] system will be discovered. The use of SKA to find low-luminosity MSPs in the GCs of the Milky Way would then be able to support the hypothesis that IMBHs of mass $100 \\msun$ are commonly hosted in GCs."}
{"text":"\nWe explore the properties of toric quiver gauge theories, which are four-dimensional conformal field theories obtained through the AdS\/CFT correspondence induced on the world-volume of a stack of D3-branes placed at the tip of a toric Calabi-Yau cone at an ``orbifold point'' in Kaehler moduli space. It is now understood that these gauge theories are encoded in two-dimensional torus graphs, known as brane tilings, which can be derived from dimer models built from the topological and symplectic properties of the toric Calabi-Yau cone and without requiring knowledge of the dual Sasaki-Einstein metric. In this paper, we analyze the symmetries of the toric quiver theories to determine the dimer models, which we then use to study the moduli space of the theory both classically and semiclassically. Additionally, utilizing mirror symmetry, we elaborate on the origin of the brane tilings and how they surface in connection with fractional D6-branes in string theory, mirror to the stack of D3-branes at the tip of the cone."}
{"text":"\nUsing high-quality images from the Large Binocular Telescope, we conducted a deep and wide-field photometric survey of the newly-found Hercules dwarf spheroidal galaxy. By mapping a 23' times 23' field, our three-filter photometry revealed colour-magnitude diagrams that extended down to around 1.5 magnitudes below the main sequence turnoff of the Hercules dwarf. Our analysis allowed us to accurately select likely Hercules members and observe the structure of the system at an unprecedented scale. Strikingly, we discovered that compared to other dwarf spheroidal satellite galaxies of the Milky Way, the Hercules dwarf exhibits an extremely elongated shape (3:1). We suggest that its unusual shape is likely due to tidally disruptive forces, being at a relatively high distance from the centre of the Milky Way. This would indicate that the Hercules dwarf is on an eccentric orbit around the Milky Way."}
{"text":"This article provides an overview and guide to the calculation of nonequilibrium steady states of matrix product form. We begin by introducing this class of stochastic nonequilibrium systems, which is used to model various phenomena such as biological transport and traffic flow, and discuss their interesting physical properties such as shocks and phase transitions. We then explain the matrix product approach and how it relates to similar methods in other physical contexts, providing a unified view of the means by which the macroscopic physical quantities can be calculated. We also analyse more advanced topics like nonequilibrium free energy functionals, the classification of exclusion processes involving multiple particle species, existence proofs of the matrix product state, and parallel dynamics. Finally, we discuss open problems for future research in this field."}
{"text":"\nBy employing high-precision radial-velocity measurements, scientists recently detected p-modes on the bright solar-like star alpha Cen A. To obtain a better understanding of these modes and the stellar interior, the HARPS spectrograph measured alpha Cen A over five nights. It was observed 34 p-modes with angular degrees from l=0-3, related to frequencies in the range of 1.8-2.9 mHZ and amplitudes between 13-48 cm\/s. In considering the significant inclination axis of alpha Cen A as well as the results of frequency scatter, it was concluded that rotational splitting is a factor in explaining the low values of mode lifetimes. New small separations were derived while also taking into account the effect of rotational splitting. This observational study of alpha Cen A presents a selection of properly identified p-mode frequencies while stressing the importance of considering the star's rotation in order to accurately characterize the p-modes, especially in shorter campaigns."}
{"text":"\nBy studying infrared spectra from the Spitzer Space Telescope, evidence suggests that debris disks with central clearings also harbour giant planets. Through numerical integrations, a minimum planetary spacing is calculated, with respect to the age and planet masses of the system, for the orbital instability which is necessary for the elimination of developing planetary bodies and dust from the outer disk. Specifically, a 10^8 year-old debris disk around an A-type star, with a dust disk edge at a distance of 50 AU, must contain up to 5 Neptune-mass planets within the clearing radius and the iceline in order to fully eliminate the evidence of its primitive state. It is argued that existing debris disks are found to contain at least a cumulative mass of a fifth of a Jupiter in planets. Furthermore, an order of magnitude higher mass in planets could populate these systems if the planetary masses are increased."}
{"text":"\nThis paper delves into the properties of the higher order Schwarzian derivative, Sf(x), which is used to assess whether a given function f(x) is capable of displaying chaotic behavior. We investigate the conditions for chaotic behavior of higher order polynomials, as well as for analytic functions which are solution to non-linear differential equations. Our analysis reveals a sufficient condition for chaos that is invariant with respect to both the degree of the polynomial, as well as the coefficients of the three highest order terms, and is represented by a Hankel determinant of order two."}
{"text":"We analyze the orbital dynamics of the 4 giant planets of the Solar System when in a primordial gaseous disk, which extends over previous studies by Masset and Snellgrove (2001) and Morbidelli and Crida (2007). Conclusions obtained from our simulations suggest that there are six possible configurations of orbital resonances in which the planets can arrange themselves in a steady state. The two most extended configurations have the potential to remain intact over hundreds of millions of years even when the gas dissipates. When simulated with an accompanying planetesimal disk, the planets have been seen to migrate from one of these stable states to its current orbital architecture, reproducing the evolutionary process described by Tsiganis et al. (2005)."}
{"text":"This paper examines the link between geometry and physical constants in a Kaluza-Klein Tetrad Model. We demonstrate that when bispinor fields are incorporated into the model, all fields can have the same physical dimensions, the Lagrangian does not depend on any physical constants except for mass, and all physical constants in the field equations originate from geometry. This connection between geometry and physical constants is an unusually strong feature of Dirac's bispinor equation, realized through the satisfaction of conditions (i), (ii) and (iii)."}
{"text":"\nIn this paper, we explore the mass dependence, time evolution, and degree of outflows associated with star formation in the Perseus molecular cloud. We surveyed 51 submillimetre cores and 37 of those showed evidence of protostellar outflows in their broad linewings - with 13 of those potentially being false positives due to confusion with neighbouring flows. Near-infrared detections further confirmed that 65 percent of the cores are protostars. Comparing our results to Spitzer infrared detections, outflow maps at this same sensitivity were found to be just as good as Spitzer in identifying protostars. Outflow momentum flux displays correlations with core mass and source luminosity, but with a large degree of scatter. Furthermore, our results did not provide strong evidence for the Bontemps et al. (1996) assertion of lower momentum fluxes for Class I sources in comparison to Class 0 sources. Lastly, our sample also included low momentum flux, low-luminosity Class 0 sources potentially signifying an early stage of star formation - a stage that may last longer than the current lifetime estimates for the embedded phase. Our findings suggest that additional mechanisms may be necessary for the removal of mass from protostellar cores."}
{"text":"This paper presents a comprehensive investigation of 61 B-type stars located in four stellar clusters of the Milky Way, Large Magellanic Cloud and Small Magellanic Cloud. Using the TLUSTY non-LTE model atmosphere code, quantitative measures of the stars' atmospheric parameters and abundances of the major metal elements (C, N, O, Mg, Si, Fe) were obtained. Our analysis, along with previous work on younger clusters in the same galaxies, yields a consistent dataset of abundances and parameters for more than 100 B-type stars in the three galaxies. By examining the nitrogen abundances in detail, this study further acquaints us with the role of rotation in the evolution of stars. Furthermore, we provide effective temperature scales of B-type stars for the three galaxies that display an illuminating connection between luminosity, metallicity and effective temperature."}
{"text":"In this paper, we present the linearization of the Painlev\u00e9 III-VI equations through the similarity reductions of the (2+1)-dimensional three-wave interaction system and its Lax pairs. This leads to new 3x3 matrix Fuchs-Garnier pairs for the third and fifth Painlev\u00e9 equations, in addition to the previously known pair for the fourth and sixth Painlev\u00e9 equations. The Fuchs-Garnier pairs reveal the linear nature of their spectral parameter, and we applied the Laplace transformation to examine their reductions to the standard 2x2 matrix Fuchs-Garnier pairs, as determined by M. Jimbo and T. Miwa. We demonstrate the applications of the 3x3 pairs through the integral auto-transformation for the fifth Painlev\u00e9 equation and a further integral transformation relating two distinct 2x2 matrix Fuchs-Garnier pairs for the third Painlev\u00e9 equation."}
{"text":"The present work has investigated the convergence of post-CCSD (coupled cluster\nwith single and double excitations) numerical effects on molecular atomization\nenergies as the basis set approaches the one-particle limit.

{"text":"The derivation of the effective potential V in the massless $\\lambda\\phi^4$ model with a global O(N) symmetry can be reproduced using renormalization group functions and the Coleman-Weinberg renormalization condition $\\frac{d^4V}{d\\phi^4}|_{\\phi = \\mu} = \\lambda$, where $\\mu$ is the renormalization scale. A systematic method of expressing the n-loop effective potential in terms of the known minimal subtraction (MS) renormalization-group functions to the Coleman-Weinberg scheme is established, as well as the summation of leading- and subsequent-to-leading-logarithm contributions to V. To exemplify this, the five-loop effective potential is shown to be acquired from the known five-loop MS renormalization group functions. Moreover, multiscale renormalization group techniques are used to circulate the RG functions of MS scheme to CW scheme in massless scalar QED which has two couplings."}
{"text":"\nThis study describes the development and use of a classical potential to characterize the martensitic phase transformations between $\\alpha$, $\\beta$ and $\\omega$ phases of titanium. Parameters of a modified embedded atom potential have been optimized to match a database of density-functional calculations. The accuracy of the resulting potential is tested by performing comparisons with both experimental and density-functional results. Molecular dynamics simulations enabled the mapping of the pressure-temperature phase diagram for titanium with the new potential. Results show that the transformation between $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ can occur at standard pressure and a temperature of 1200 Kelvin. Additonally, the $\\alpha - \\omega$ transition can be observed at ambient conditions, while the $\\beta - \\omega$ transformion is observed at 1200 K and pressures higher than 8 GPa. Also, the triple point of the transformation occurs at 8 GPa and 1200 K. Molecular dynamics investigation into the dynamics of the $\\alpha -\\omega$ transition also shows a fast-moving interface that has a low energy of 30 meV\/\\AA$^2$. Through these results, the established potential is applicable to the exploration of the properties of defects and phase transformations of titanium."}
{"text":"\nAn investigation was conducted examining the symmetry properties and the ground state of an orbital Hubbard model consisting of two orbitals partly filled with spin-polarized electrons on a cubic lattice, similar to ferromagnetic manganites. Found that due to the off-diagonal hopping for transitions between $x^2-y^2$ and $3z^2-r^2$ orbitals and the lack of SU(2) invariance in orbital space, superexchange contributes to all orbital ordered states, the Nagaoka theorem does not apply, and the kinetic energy is enhanced in comparison to the spin case. This makes orbital ordered states harder to stabilize in the Hartree-Fock approximation and the onset of ferro-orbital and antiferro-orbital polarizations are alike, unlike in spin cases. Subsequently, a cubic-gauge invariant slave boson approach is formulated with orbitals containing complex coefficients in mean-field approximation which gives accurate estimates of the ground-state energy of disordered states. Results show that in the regime of high Coulomb repulsion the orbital order is unstable, leading instead to a highly correlated orbital liquid with random orbitals at any electron filling."}
{"text":"\nIn this article, we explore the implications when two regular singular points of the hypergeometric equation coalesce into an irregular one. Our investigation encompasses the entire parameter domain surrounding the origin. In particular, we analyze the source of logarithmic terms in the solutions of the unfolded system. Via the use of a first integral of the Riccati system connected to the hypergeometric equation, we look at the monodromy in the two sectors of this parameter space. We find that the logarithmic terms that arise in the solutions can be expressed as a Stokes multiplier which is the limit of an obstruction that prevents the two eigenvectors of the monodromy operator at each singular point from being equivalent."}
{"text":"\nThis paper explores the application of functional methods to the Generalized Dicke Model, which describes an assembly of N identical two-level atoms (qubits) which couple to a lone bosonic field. By substituting atomic pseudo-spin operators with a combination of Fermi operators, a fermion Dicke model is proposed. Through the path integral approach and functional method, we explore the system's potential to exhibit a second-order phase transition from normal to superradiance at a certain temperature, as well as the possibility of quantum phase critical behaviour when certain coupling constants are in place.  We evaluate the critical transition temperature and present the spectrum of collective bosonic excitations, as well as the outcome of two particular scenarios: the one applied to the rotating-wave approximation, and the other one focusing on virtual processes. For the latter, a superradiant phase was revealed at some critical coupling, which demonstrates the emergence of a Goldstone mode."}
{"text":"\nConnectivity between different spatial locations is often explored through coherence and phase synchronization analysis of their respective time series. Commonly used signals in neurophysiology are electric neuronal activity obtained by invasive recordings or computed from non-invasive, very high time resolution extracranial scalp electric potential differences (EEG) and magnetic fields (MEG) using sLORETA. In this article, two problems associated with this approach are outlined and solved: the generalization of coherence and phase synchronization to pairs of multivariate time series and the removal of artificially high zero-lag contributions. Additionally, two other generalizations are discussed and a randomization method for testing the significance of connectivity is presented. It is possible to apply the proposed measures to pairs of univariate EEG\/MEG signals, though this cannot be interpreted as connectivity due to the inherent low spatial resolution of the tomography."}
{"text":"We compare the X-ray to optical flux ratios (F_x\/F_opt) of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the Chandra Deep Field North (CDF-N) to those seen in local Seyfert 2 galaxies. Using the local population's luminosity function, we simulate the F_x\/F_opt that local Seyfert 2s would have if observed between 0.2 < z < 1.3 as part of the CDF-N, accounting for redshift effects and flux-limitation. We see excellent agreement between our simulation results and the F_x\/F_opt distributions of absorbed AGN in the CDF-N, indicating no physical differences between the two populations. Our evidence supports the notion that the nuclear emission lines of distant hard X-ray galaxies are undetectable due to signal-to-noise ratio, wavelength coverage, and the contamination of the emission signal by host-galaxy light."}
{"text":"We present and analyze results from multiple broadband near-infrared (IR) observations of Sgr A*, the emission source associated with the supermassive black hole at the Galactic Center. Our measurements, taken with the laser and natural guide star adaptive optics systems on the Keck II telescope, yielded constant spectral index values of alpha = -0.6+-0.2 over a range of 2-30 mJy of dereddened flux density. This is consistent with the values observed at X-ray wavelengths during most outbursts. We further observed a possible correlation between one IR outburst and an associated X-ray outburst, as well as several similar IR outbursts without elevated X-ray emission, which challenges the idea linking IR and X-ray emission to the same electrons. We suggest an acceleration mechanism that establishes a variable high-energy cutoff, but leaves the majority of the electron energy distribution, generating the IR emission, unchanged. This might be driven by turbulence from a magnetorotational instability, in which the outer scale length of the turbulence varies."}
{"text":"\nAt low redshifts, an estimated 90% of total baryon mass is unaccounted for, and researchers have theorized that these \"missing baryons\" are in the form of gas located in higher density areas like overdense filaments that connect galaxies and galaxy clusters. Approximately 30% of these baryons can be located in Ly alpha absorption studies but there remains the majority, about 50%, thought to be in a temperature range of 1E5 to 1E7 K. Temperatures as low as 2-5E5 K can be detected through OVI absorption and small amounts at 1E5 are thought to be detectable through broad Ly absorption. Hotter gases of 0.5-2E6 K can be observed via OVII and OVIII K X-ray absorption. However, due to issues with background subtraction and field flattening, there have been no substantial detections of intergalactic hot gas (temperatures between 0.5-10E6K) in either absorption or emission. As instrument sensitivity increases, it is expected that these missing baryons would become detectable."}
{"text":"We analyze X-ray luminosity functions of normal galaxies in the GOODS survey. SED fitting was carried out to determine a sample of 40 early-type galaxies and 46 late-type galaxies. We estimate the k-corrections for the X-ray\/optical and X-ray\/NIR flux ratios, which helped to distinguish AGN from the normal galaxies. We apply a power-law model, with both classical and Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques, and saw that the XLFs were significantly different at low and high redshift. Furthermore, we applied the Schechter and log-normal models, and found that the log L* shifted by dlogL* = 0.23 +\/- 0.16 dex (for early-type galaxies) and 0.34 +\/- 0.12 dex (for late-type galaxies) as a result of redshift evolution, which was consistent across both models."}
{"text":"\nIn this thesis, differential renormalization is proposed as a straightforward\nrenormalization approach for analyzing perturbative gauge theories.

Particular attention is paid to the two-loop beta functions of\ndifferent pertinent gauge theories like QED, SuperQED, Yang-Mills, and N=1\nSuperYM. This is accomplished without relying on the Ward identities usually\nobligatory while using the typical differential renormalization\nprocedure. The study also discloses how to treat expressions comprising\nboth ultraviolet and infrared divergences and is successful in\ndemonstrating that these diversities are regulated through independent\nscales. This outcome bestows new ideas concerning the source of higher-order\ncorrections to the beta function of the N=1 SuperYM theory since, in this\ncase, divergences owing to the shape of the gauge propagator are both\nvisible. In contrast, usual dimensional regularization methods blur both\ndivergences into one."}
{"text":"\n\nWe present a method of analyzing luminosity functions of Ly-alpha emitters spanning a range of redshifts from 5.7 to 8.8, in order to demonstrate the constraints on their mass-to-light ratio (M_h\/L_band). Our analysis shows that, when considering the survival fraction of Ly-alpha photons (alpha_esc) and the 'duty cycle' of emitters (epsilon), a ratio of M_h\/L_bol of 21-38, 14-26, and 9-17 can be derived respectively for three different metallicity scenarios (Z = 0, 1\/50, and 1 Z_sun). These results suggest that Ly-alpha emitters are either starburst galaxies, with M_h\/L_bol values around 0.1-1 and smaller Ly-alpha survival allowing for alpha_escepsilon^(1\/gamma) to be approximately 0.01-0.05, or normal populations, if it is assumed that a large percentage of Ly-alpha photons survived (alpha_escepsilon^(1\/gamma) is 0.5-1). Our investigation reveals no strong evidence of reionization and\/or evolution of Ly-alpha emitter properties found in recent Ly-alpha surveys, and the absence of sources at z=8.8 provides no significant constraints either. Nevertheless, the data is sufficient to imply that these sources could still be responsible for the observed excess NIRB."}
{"text":"\nThis study examines the molecular clouds of Lupus I, III, and IV with imagery from Spitzer Space Telescope's Multiband Imaging Photometer for Spitzer (MIPS) instrument. Our data processing differs slightly from that of the c2d pipeline, and by comparing our source counts with the Wainscoat catalog, we can deduce the contribution of background galaxies. Additionally, we create two color-magnitude diagrams with the 2MASS and MIPS data, allowing us to distinguish probable young stellar objects from galaxies. We also establish extinction maps and calculate the mass of each Lupus cloud, which can then be compared to analogous estimates using $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O. Finally, 12 candidates are singled out as potential young stellar objects, and 5 of these are discussed in more detail."}
{"text":"\nWe have developed a technique for direct determination of the epicycle frequency $\\kappa$ in the galactic disk from a large database of open clusters. From the catalog data, we evaluated the observed velocity vector (direction and magnitude) of the clusters in the galactic plane. For large-scale asymmetric structures as galaxies, the residual velocity in the disk has a direction rotating with the frequency $\\kappa$ and the circular velocity is in determined by the galactic rotation curve. By observing any non-random initial velocities in the clusters, plot of the orientation angle of the velocity as a function of age reveals the epicycle frequency. Analysis of the data confirmed this non-random direction and enabled us to measure $\\kappa$ for different galactic radii. Our results are independent of Galactic arm models, such as the number of spiral arms or the particular choice of the radius of corotation. We obtained results indicating a minimum rotation velocity beyond the solar radius of 226 $\\pm$ 15 kms$^{-1}$ and a $\\kappa$ of 42 $\\pm$ 4 kms$^{-1}$kpc$^{-1}$ at the solar radius."}
{"text":"\nThis study examined the use of shell-model calculations with the OXBASH code to evaluate the energy states of 19O, 20O, 21O, 22O, 23O, 24O, 25O, and 26O, which are neutron-rich oxygen isotopes. A selection of different interactions, such as Wildenthal, Preedom-Wildenthal, Wildenthal-Mcgrory, and the renormalized Kuo and Brown, were used in the program to compare the results of the calculations to the available experimental data. Where applicable, the empirical interactions were found to perfectly match the ordering of the levels, whilst the realistic interactions offered only a small error in the Root Mean Square difference. In the case of 21O, the realistic interactions led to a much too compressed 1\/2+ state at an energy level of 0.157 MeV; a discrepancy from the 1.218 MeV found in experiments. Results of the energy of the first 2+ state across the even isotope range were also correlated, showing a sharp increase at N=16 for both empirical and realistic interactions, and only at N=14 when using empirical interactions. This suggests that the first 2+ exited state may work as a physical cue of neuclei with a magic number at N=14 and N=16."}
{"text":"\nThrough the application of relativistic many-body perturbation theory, the 7s, 7p, 6d, and 5f states of ions Feign to francium (Z = 87-100) have been evaluated for excitation energies, polarizabilities, multipole transition rates, and lifetimes. In particular, third-order estimates of reduced matrix elements and oscillator strengths for 7s-7p, 7p-6d, and 6d-5f electric-dipole transitions were determined, as well as 7s-6d, 7s-5f, and 5f_5\/2-5f_7\/2 multipole matrix elements for lifetimes of low-lying excited states. Furthermore, for the ions ranging from Z = 87 to 92, the relativistic all-order single-double (SD) method was utilized, taking into account single and double excitations of Dirac-Fock wave functions to all orders. Concurrently, ground state scalar polarizabilities in Fr I, Ra II, Ac III and Th IV were calculated using third and all order relativistic methods. These results provide an extensive and reliable theoretical reference point for the comparison of experiment and future theory."}
{"text":"\nUsing the theory of ultra-relativistic shock dynamics, known as CCW theory, we present an adaptation of the non-relativistic theory that is applicable to ultra-relativistic shocks advancing into an ideal fluid. We perform a comparison of exact results for certain self-similar cylindrical and spherical shocks with power-law pre-shock density profiles and numerical solutions of the full hydrodynamic equations. Furthermore, we contextualize this adaptation of CCW theory within the context of relativistic vorticity and circulation, emphasizing that in an ultra-relativistic ideal fluid, circulation can be understood as only changing at shocks even with the presence of entropy gradients in the smooth parts of the flow."}
{"text":"Owing to the Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) afterglows, a greater than expected magnetic field strength is necessary. We offer an invigorated idea for fulfilling this requirement by using the amplified turbulence that develops when the shock interacts with a clumpy pre-shock medium, for instance a stellar wind. Drawing upon an accurate fresh method for based localized perturbations for shocks with ultra-relativistic velocities, we set up the limits on the lengthscale, intensity, and volume filling factor of the density clusters needed to generate a desired magnetic energy fraction within the duration of expansion received by the shock, based on the presumption that the energy in the field equals the energy of turbulence. With a greater Lorentz power of the shock, stronger and miniscule scale inegalitarianism are of greater concern. Thus it is plausible that the magnetic energy fraction develops in association with the shock's lowered speed. This could be tested by keeping track of the synchrotron cooling frequency should the radial density profile before the shock, eased out over the clusters, be identified."}
{"text":"\nThis article examines the feasibility of stabilizing moduli of the type--IIB string theory in $\\T^6\/\\Z_2$ toroidal orientifolds when worldvolume fluxes are deemed necessary. We ultimately conclude that in a broad range of $\\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric models defined by the various types of fluxes applied to the D-brane worldvolume, it is impossible to achieve stable moduli. In particular, our results imply that in order for a consistent supersymmetric model to be established, Abelian worldvolume fluxes are not enough to stabilize the closed string moduli. Additionally, it is shown that for certain other $Z_2$ orientifolds of $\\T^6$, the same consistency requirements are not fulfilled. To illustrate the general findings, the example of a D9-brane wrapping on a complex three-torus with semi-homogeneous bundle-type worldvolume fluxes, and a D7-brane wrapping on a holomorphic four-cycle of the complex three-torus while also carrying worldvolume fluxes, are also considered."}
{"text":"\nIn this study, high-resolution satellite imagery was employed to investigate the effects of significant earthquakes on the system of lineaments. Through processing the satellite images with specialized techniques, such as directional filtering and the Hough Transform, changes in the structure of lineaments were examined quantitatively. The \"Lineament Extraction and Stripes Statistic Analysis\" (LESSA) software package was applied to detect any shifts within the system. Six earthquakes of greater than a magnitude 4.5 were studied in areas of low climatic variability and limited vegetation on the coast of South America. Results indicate that the number of lineaments shifted prior to the seismic activity, then tending to return to their original state over the following months. Distinctions between the magnitude of the earthquakes and convergent plate boundaries were noted, providing evidence for the development of a seismic risk monitoring system for these areas."}
{"text":"\nUsing the Chandra X-Ray Observatory, we present the X-ray observations of the Type II-plateau supernova SN 2004et located in the spiral galaxy NGC 6946. By comparing pre-and post-explosion observations, we determined that the X-ray source was consistent with the optical position, with a total of 202, 151, and 158 detected photons in three 29 ks pointings on 2004 October 22, November 6, and December 3 respectively. Spectral fitting suggests that the unabsorbed luminosity was approximately 4x 10^{38} erg\/s at a distance of 5.5 Mpc and a temperature of kT = 1.3 keV with line-of-sight absorption of N_H = 1.0 x 10^{22} cm^{-2}. We found that the emission was likely from a reverse shock region created by the ejecta of the supernova and the progenitor wind. Further analysis of the softening of the source over time indicates decreasing shell absorption. Our results imply a pre-supernova mass loss rate of (2-2.5)x 10^{-6} M_{\\odot}\/yr  with a wind velocity of 10 km\/s which is in accordance with the expectations of a Type IIP supernova."}
{"text":"This paper investigates the exact solutions of the five-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory in a vacuum. It has been found that the base manifold of this theory must have a constant curvature. Three branches of static solutions exist: black holes, wormholes, and spacetime horns. Depending on the values of the coupling constants, these solutions could have a horizon geometry and negative constant Ricci scalar for black holes and wormholes and a vanishing Ricci scalar for spacetime horns. The gravitational and centrifugal forces can point in the same direction in regions of wormholes and spacetime horns. Furthermore, these solutions all have finite Euclidean action, with the mass obtained from a surface integral."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate the adiabatic quantum dynamics of a disordered Ising chain at its quantum critical point. This model is composed of an Ising chain in a transverse field with disorder in both the exchange coupling and the transverse field. By applying the Kibble-Zurek mechanism, the transverse field is reducing linearly from infinity to zero with an annealing rate $\\tau^{-1}$, from the quantum disordered phase to the classical ferromagnetic phase. Our study addressed the gap distribution at the critical point $\\Gamma_c=1$, and then moved to simulating the results from the residual energy and the defect density as a function of the inverse annealing rate $\\tau$. From the findings, the average quantities $E_{\\rm res}(\\tau)$ and $\\rho_k(\\tau)$ both have logarithmic behavior with different exponents. We then proposed a mechanism to explain the $1\/\\ln^2(\\tau)$ behavior of $[\\rho_k]_{\\rm av}$ through the use of Landau-Zener tunneling theory and a real-space renormalization of the relevant gaps. This model serves as a demonstration of how an adiabatic quantum computation can become slower due to disorder even in the absence of frustration."}
{"text":"\nWe have used NIR imaging to survey an area of around 400 sq. arcmin. of the Carina Nebula that includes the star clusters Tr 14 and Tr 16. Our 10 sigma limiting magnitudes of J ~ 18.5, H ~ 17.5 and K_s ~16.5 have enabled us to detect 544 Class II and 11 Class I young star candidates, including 40 previously unknown red sources with H-K_s > 2. The majority of the stars found are in the direction of the clusters, giving insight into their various evolutionary stages. Comparison of color-magnitude diagrams with pre-main sequence model tracks suggests Tr 14 and Tr 16 are very young (<3 Myr); the K_s band luminosity function of Tr 14 further confirming an age of 1-2 Myr. Two hard X-ray sources were also identified near one of the MSX point sources, which may be related to Class I\/Class 0 objects. The mass estimate derived for the clusters is in agreement with the Canonical Salpeter Field Star Initial Mass Function."}
{"text":"\nThis paper examines the implications of complexity theory for human progress and innovation. It argues that our society is characterized by a cycle of bubbles, created by the positive feedback of speculation and herding which can lead to risks that would otherwise not be taken using traditional cost\/benefit analysis; however, when these bubbles succeed, they can yield extraordinary results. The underlying mathematical structure of these bubbles is discussed, including the emergence of heavy-tailed power laws, outliers\/kings\/black swans, predictability\/illusory control and more, and relevant policy implications are outlined. Ultimately, this analysis seeks to highlight the vital role that bubbles play in human progress."}
{"text":"\nIn this article, we explore the role that rho mesons play in describing pion electroproduction experiments at JLab. An effective Lagrangian approach, incorporating nucleon, pion, and rho meson degrees of freedom, is utilized. Simulations of two different field representations of the rho meson are tested, namely vector and tensor, with the latter being found to be more successful. The contribution of the rho meson t-pole, along with the interference of a non-local contact term, play an important role in the description of data at W less than 2.2 GeV and Q2 less than 2.5 GeV2\/c2. Moreover, we examine the compatibility of a ``soft'' form of piNN and rhoNN form factors with these data. Through the successful description of both sigmaL and sigmaT parts of the cross section, we stress the significance of studying sigmaT data when extracting the charge pion form factor Fpi from sigmaL."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate the effects of a nonlinear magnetic diffusion and an effective drift velocity of large-scale magnetic fields in a two-dimensional Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) turbulence at large magnetic Reynolds numbers. Results show that transport of mean-square magnetic potential has significant effect on quenching of turbulent magnetic diffusion given large-scale magnetic fields greater than a certain value. This implies that the catastophic quenching of turbulent magnetic diffusion will not take place under certain circumstances, similar to the scenario of three-dimensional MHD turbulence with high magnetic Reynolds numbers. In this scenario, lack of small-scale magnetic helicity will not lead to catastrophic quenching of the alpha effect."}
{"text":"In this work, we investigate the inspiral of massive BHs in galaxy mergers by carrying out a series of high-resolution N-Body\/SPH simulations. We observe the rapid formation of a Keplerian BH binary in the midst of a turbulent nuclear disc (~10^9 Msun). To account for the various accretion rates, we employ physically and numerically motivated recipes. We then analyze the three possible ways in which the galaxies and BHs fulfill the M-sigma relation: Adjustment, Symbiosis and BH Dominance. From our extremely high-resolution runs, we observe that BH feedback is likely to be effective near the end of the merger, and the BH binary is required to undergo dynamical friction to cause the circularization of its orbit. This manifests itself in the formation of a small-sized accretion disc around each BH with a few percent of the BH's mass, and resulting in potential double AGN activity with typical separations of ~10 pc."}
{"text":"\nThis article examines the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in order to analyze its gene (de)regulation properties in humans. EBV is responsible for different levels of serious and mild illnesses and is known as a tumourivirus. Our investigation investigates a physical-chemical model switch between latency I and latency III states of EBV, paying attention to the unique number of binding sites of two distinct transcription factors - one belonging to the virus, and one from its host. We conclude that this switch can be sharpened either through cooperative binding between molecules of the exact same species, or through competition between two species if enough steric hindrance is present."}
{"text":"\nThe recent analysis of active region AR 10938 with data from the Hinode\/EIS revealed prominent features at transition region temperatures. Along the footpoints of the TRACE 1MK loops, temperatures increased and a Mg VII density diagnostic showed a decrease of the density from 3x10^9 cm^-3 at the base up to 1.5x10^9 cm^-3 at a projected height of 20 Mm. The second feature was identified as a compact active region transition region brightening, which was intense in the O V line (log T=5.4), but signatures were also present at higher temperatures of up to log T=6.3. The Mg VII density diagnostic revealed a density of 4x10^10 cm^-3, and the associated emission lines were seen to be broadened by 50 km\/s and wings were also observed up to 200 km\/s. An enhanced continuum emission in the short wavelength band was also identified and was suggested to be free-bound emission from recombination onto He^+."}
{"text":"This article provides a method to achieve an optimal H2 approximation of SISO linear time-invariant stable systems. By combining constructive algebra and eigenvalue calculations, via the methods of Stetter and Moeller, a stable system's order may be reduced by one while accounting for distinct poles and ensuring that the global optimum is found. Potential issues regarding local minima are sidestepped, and the use of Buchberger's algorithm is bypassed by formulating the first-order optimality conditions in a special manner, providing a Groebner basis for immediate use. The time and memory requirements for this method are notably less than its alternatives, thus making it applicable for systems with a higher McMillan degree, and no longer necessitating the hypotheses needed in previous works.

This paper evaluates the endurance of these clusters in the absence of disruptive forces, in particular those connected to energetic starburst episodes induced by galactic collisions. To predict their strength and longevity, the shape of the stellar initial mass function of a given cluster must be assessed. This task is not straightforward in the case of extragalactic YMCs, as HST data leave much unresolved. Even so, there is evidence that GC formation might still be under way and depend largely on the conditions of its environment. This review summarizes the outcome from worldwide efforts to study the progression of entire cluster populations, primarily based on the Hubble Space Telescope."}
{"text":"\nThis paper is a survey of the numerous contributions that Issai Schur made to the field of analysis. During the course of his work, Schur's name became associated with numerous mathematical and engineering concepts. These include the Schur test, Schur-Hadamard multipliers, Schur convexity, Schur complements, the Kojima-Schur theorem, the Schur-Cohn test, the Schur algorithm, Schur parameters, and the Schur interpolation problem for functions that are holomorphic and bound by one in the unit disk. With the aim to properly illustrate both the range and the breadth of Schur's work, the paper is structured in nine sections, each dedicated to a special theme based on his contributions. The mentioned topics have their own independent bibliographies, with very minimal overlap. A separate section is also devoted to provide a list of Schur's publications that focus on topics commonly treated in analysis. We embark with a description of Schur's less known papers in the area of commuting differential operators."}
{"text":"This research utilizes numerical simulations to investigate the spatiotemporal correlations present in the two-dimensional spring-block (Burridge-Knopoff) model of earthquakes. The model is found to manifest either a ``subcritical'' behavior or a ``supercritical'' behavior, based on the values of the model parameters. It is exposed that these two behaviors transition between each other with either a continuous or a discontinuous manner. Additionally, this model presents universal scaling properties for seismic events in both regimes. Most noteworthy are the spatiotemporal correlations exhibited in the ``supercritical'' regime--with seismicity rising sharply prior to the main shock--as those correlations are much weaker in the ``subcritical'' regime. Furthermore, both just before and after the main shock, the magnitude distribution's $B$-value changes depending on the regime. Such distinctive precursory study could lead to more accurate predictions of upcoming large earthquakes."}
{"text":"\nWe provide observational evidence of an anomalous microwave emission at high Galactic\nlatitude, measured with the 11 GHz radiometer of the COSMOSOMAS experiment at the Teide\nObservatory. The region observed amounted to 6500 square degrees, with an average\nsensitivity of 50 microK per beam. The maps indicated a dust-correlated component which\nwas likely of galactic origin, with an amplitude of \\Delta T estimated to be 9-13 micK.\nAn analysis of the spectral behaviour of this component, in comparison to previous\nCOSMOSOMAS observations at 13-17 GHz and WMAP data at 22-94 GHz for the same region of\nthe sky, revealed a flattening in the spectral index with frequencies below 20 GHz,\nwhich severely constrains the origin of the emission to be exclude synchrotron radiation.\nA combination of free-free emission and spinning dust models was found to adequately\nexplain the anomalous emission, with a flux density peaking around 20 GHz."}
{"text":"This paper examines a mathematical model for a copolymer of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic monomers immersed in an emulsion of oil and water. Using the parameters $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ as an indication of the energetics of the copolymer, the structure of the system is divided into two distinct regimes. In the first, the blocks of oil percolate and a single curve indicative of the critical energy of the system is present. In the second, the oil blocks do not percolate and three separate curves determine the difference between localized and delocalized phases and two tricritical points. Different phases of the copolymer can be observed depending on the energetics of the system."}
{"text":"\nA thorough examination of the extended Falicov-Kimball model with a hybridization potential and dispersive narrow band is conducted by the Kotliar-Ruckenstein slave boson theory. In absence of the hybridization, the phase diagram is greatly impacted by the orbital structure: a correlated-insulating state is reached with degenerate orbitals when the interaction reaches a sufficient strength, and a discontinuous valence transition can be caused by a difference in orbital energy. Even with a finite hybridization potential, the phase diagram remains highly sensitive. In comparison to Hartree-Fock theory, a larger effect of inter-orbital Coulomb repulsion is seen. Excitonic insulator state is solely found among degenerate orbitals, implying a limited parameter space."}
{"text":"\nThis paper employs the XSCORT code to examine the impact that an accretion disk wind has on the X-ray spectrum of AGN. Results from the study show that for a range of velocity, density distributions, total column densities and initial ionization parameters, the spectra of AGN with soft X-ray excesses seen through an accretion disk wind, involve substantial complexity and structure. Notably, the presence of sharp features produced by the XSCORT code contrasts sharply with the smooth nature of the observed X-ray spectra of AGN, casting doubt on the ability of accretion disk winds to produce soft X-ray excesses. Further study suggests that a terminal velocity of roughly the speed of light would need to be involved in order to remove these features, but that such an outflow cannot likely be associated with a radiatively driven accretion disk wind. Suggesting that a highly relativistic jet may be a more suitable source for the material."}
{"text":"This thesis reviews a configuration space method presented by C. Dullemond and\nE. van Beveren for computing all propagators of a scalar field in four-dimensional Minkowski and Anti de Sitter spacetimes AdS_4. Subsequently, this method is further applied to AdS_d and de Sitter dS_d for arbitrary dimension d, where the results agree with prior works. As a bonus, the conformal dimensions of the corresponding CFT fields are derived. Moreover, through assembling facts from various sources, the investigation compiles general geometric properties of AdS and dS spacetime into an overview, such as various coordinates, metrics, chordal distances, connections between conformal dimensions \\Delta and the scalar field's mass m, geodesic as well as the invariance of time ordering."}
{"text":"\n\nThis article explores an analytical model to distinguish between star clusters that feature a bimodal hydrodynamic response versus those that can only generate stationary winds. In the former scenario, intense radiative cooling occurs at the innermost regions that cause an accumulation of matter released by supernovae and stars. This, in turn, eventually results in the creation of additional stellar formations. At the same time, the outer regions can support a fixed wind. Our approach relies on basic hydrodynamic equations and raises the assumption that the density close to the cluster surface increases almost linearly to the stagnation radius. This theory is supported by both semi-analytic and computational simulations. Our analytical model then makes it possible to decide the mechanical luminosity threshold needed for clusters to operate under either of the two solutions. Furthermore, it is feasible to ascertain the fraction of matter recycled or blown away depending on the stagnation radius, by calculating it with simple analytic expressions."}
{"text":"This article explores a technique to accurately and unambiguously identify a given unknown coherent state compared to two unknown coherent reference states. Specifically, two distinct modes of an electromagnetic field are prepared in unknown coherent states, alpha 1 and alpha 2, respectively. The third mode is either in the state alpha 1 or alpha 2. The purpose of this study is to determine which of the two states is equivalent. To accomplish this goal, an experimental system incorporating three beamsplitters is presented, though it is not proven to be optimal. In addition, an optimal state comparison of coherent states is demonstrated to be possible with a single beamsplitter. An experimental setup containing 2N-1 beamsplitters to permit unambiguous identification among N unknown coherent states is also proposed. This setup can be seen as a type of quantum database search in which different unknown states are encoded into different modes of a given electromagnetic field and it is the task of this system to precisely identify the two modes that represent the same state."}
{"text":"\nWe describe an accessible, cost-effective method for astrometric data acquisition through the digitization and measurement of original \"Carte du Ciel\" plates located in the San Fernando zone. The plates consist of photographic material taken in 1903 with a limiting photographic magnitude of 14.5, and a temporal range of -10 < dec < -2. A commercial flatbed scanner is used to make the digitization, however, post scanning Corrections must be made to account for the distortion caused by the scanner. Challenges associated with triple-exposure images and grid lines on some plates are also discussed. The final measures are reduced to celestial coordinates by the Tycho-2 Catalogue. The precision achieved on a single plate is comparable with that of slower, costlier, and limited availability conventional measuring machines, with an estimated accuracy over large multi-plate areas of 0.2\"."}
{"text":"We experimentally explore and measure the temperature-dependent spatial correlations within the dynamics of glassforming liquids. Our data reveals that the number of molecules that are dynamically correlated, N_corr, increases near the glass transition. This growth is modest but consistent with an activation-based picture of the dynamics. At higher temperatures, N_corr tends to follow the power-law of the relaxation time. We also observe a similar behavior for the response to density, though less prominent than for temperature. Our results are based on the three-point dynamic susceptibilities and their connection to the four-point dynamic susceptibilities associated with dynamical heterogeneities."}

{"text":"\nUsing multiple instruments, this paper introduces an approach to measure the velocities of flow in the solar corona. Data sets including the SWAN\/SOHO instrument's solar wind mass flux, LASCO-C2 electron density values and IPS interplanetary solar wind velocities were analyzed and cross-compared. It was found that the combination of the LASCO density readings at 6 solar radii and the IPS velocities mirrors the SWAN mass flux relating to the fast wind, however not for the slow wind. This appears to be evidence that the velocity of the fast solar wind has reached its terminal velocity at around 6 solar radii and continues to maintain a constant speed further away, unlike the slow solar wind that has only achieved half of its terminal velocity and thus is carrying on to accelerate beyond this point.Mixing the LASCO-C2 density profiles and SWAN flux data constructed velocity profiles in the corona between 2.5 and 6 solar radii; these profiles can be used to assess models of the fast solar wind's acceleration."}
{"text":"\nThis paper explores the idea of approximating the joint posterior law $p(\\fb,\\thetab|\\gb)$ that is commonly used in unsupervised Bayesian estimation for inverse problems in imaging systems. In doing so, the goal is to obtain a simpler expression of the form of a separable law for both $\\fb$ and $\\thetab$, thereby, allowing for the development of iterative algorithms with lesser computational cost. Specifically, such approximations involve the use of exponential conjugate families and this paper provides details of the different algorithms that were obtained from different choices of these families.

{"text":"\nThe RAISHIN code has been employed to examine the stability of relativistic jets with spine-sheath structures, using both general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) and relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (RMHD) simulations. Results from these simulations show that strong magnetic fields and weakly relativistic sheath motion, c\/2, impact the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) velocity shear driven instability associated with relativistic Lorentz factor equal 2.5 jet spine-sheath interactions. Different sound and Alfven wave speeds up to c\/1.7 and 0.56 c, respectively, have been tested to evaluate the effect of increased stability of weakly magnetized systems as well as the stabilization of strongly magnetized ones. The comparison of numerical results to theoretical predictions formed through a novel normal mode analysis of the RMHD equations suggests that both c\/2 sheath speeds result in increased stability of the system."}
{"text":"\nThis article explores the effect of noise and periodic forces on traveling wave propagation in sub-excitable systems. Using a simplified Oregonator model, different types of wave propagation (or their disappearance) were observed when exposed to varying levels of noise and periodic forces. In addition, results from numerical experiments indicate that the reversal phenomena can arise in this system given the right conditions. It is suggested that the reversal phenomenon could be due to the noise and periodic force being mixed together. Additionally, the output period, and three velocities (normal, positive, and negative) of the travelling waves are investigated in sub-excitable systems under fixed noise intensity."}
{"text":"\nWe have examined the phase structure of the ($g\\phi^{4}+h\\phi^{6})_{1+1}$ Hermitian model in light of recent studies on $PT$ symmetric and non-Hermitian models. In particular, we investigated the feasibility of a phase transition from Hermitian and $PT$ symmetric to non-Hermitian and $PT$ symmetric. Such a phase transition, if confirmed experimentally, would signify that non-Hermitian and $PT$ symmetric models are not merely a mathematical construct, but are a footnote in nature. Our calculation of the effective potential to second order in the couplings provided evidence of a Hermitian to Non-Hermitian phase transition. This result provides the first instance of a classical Hermitian model that boasts a quantum correction that can break the hermiticity, while the theory remains physically valid. This is critical, as failure to recognize such a phase would break the universality of comparing this model's conclusions to other models in its particular class. Accessing this phase could lead to a better understanding of the behaviors of both Hermitian and non-Hermitian theories. Moreover, we also introduced a novel renormalization group equation for the bare vacuum energy, which showed that the original theory and the effective one are not equivalent unless the equation is used to maintain invariance when changing the scale."}
{"text":"\nThis article presents a comprehensive Hamiltonian theory for the adiabatic motion of relativistic charged particles confined by slowly changing electromagnetic fields. An extended Lie-transform perturbation analysis is used to obtain the equations of motion in the extended phase space that transforms energy and time into independent coordinates for all three adiabatic invariants. The relativistic particle Lagrangian is applied to derive the guiding-center equations of motion, which are discussed with regards to their covariant properties compared to existing works. The second and third adiabatic invariants of the bounce motion and drift motion, respectively, are obtained by successive removal of the bounce and drift phases from the guiding-center's Lagrangian. The paper finally derives first-order corrections to the second and third adiabatic invariants of the relativistic particle, which simplify and generalize previous works to encompass all three types of adiabatic motion of magnetically-trapped particles."}
{"text":"We present a calculation of the systematic correction that would be applied to observed data on the cosmological constant, given a homogeneous universe model. Our approach uses second-order perturbation theory to examine the influence of subhorizon density fluctuations on the luminosity-distance z relation in a flat, dust-filled universe. We find that the luminosity-distance-z relation is altered by a small proportion--on the order of 10^{-5}. Accounting for this effect when making inferences from local Type Ia supernovae data can lead to a large variation in the resulting Omega_Lambda values. For a sample of supernovae spanning the redshifts 0.02 to 0.15, we deduce Omega_Lambda=0.004. We find that the magnitude of this correction increases as the redshifts decrease, illustrating the need for this effect to be taken into account when making precision measurements at low distances. We conclude that although this variation is significant, it is too small to account for the measured value of Omega_Lambda=0.7. In comparison to other similar findings of major backreaction effects, our work focuses on the application of these effects to observations."}
{"text":"\nIn this paper, we explore the implications of the 3-He isotope abundance on different areas of astrophysics. Our research involves utilizing the 8.665 GHz hyperfine transition of 3-He+ to measure the 3-He\/H ratio within the Milky Way interstellar medium. We particularly focuses on how to correct for the ionization of these sources when attempting to derive accurate 3-He\/H abundances from the collected data. We base our correction on radio recombination lines for H+ and 4-He+, and then implement simple core-halo source models to identify sources for which the ionization can be accurately estimated. Results from an extensive range of ionization structure models suggest that the correction factor is somewhere between 1 and 1.8 for most sources, raising the possibility that a combination of the nebular density and ionization structure could generate a large underestimation of the correction factor."}
{"text":"This thesis presents an improved method for detecting periodic orbits in chaotic maps and flows. It combines the stabilising transformations proposed by Schmelcher and Diakonos with a modified semi-implicit Euler iterative scheme and seeding with periodic orbits of neighbouring periods. This technique is highly efficient when applied to low-dimensional systems, but can be difficult to apply to higher-dimensional systems due to the rapid growth of the number of required stabilising transformations. To address this challenge, the thesis introduces a novel approach which relies on the knowledge of stability matrices of already-detected periodic orbits to reduce the number of transformations and increase the efficiency of the detection algorithm. The efficacy of this approach is demonstrated by its application to a four-dimensional kicked double rotor map, a six-dimensional system of three coupled H\u00e9non maps, and the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky system in a weakly turbulent regime."}
{"text":"\nAnalyses of imaging polarimetry obtained with the ACS\/HRC of the 9 closest radio-galaxies in the 3C catalogue with an FR I morphology have revealed high levels of nuclear polarization ranging from ~2-11 % with a median value of 7%. We recognize that the only viable explanation for this phenomenon is a synchrotron origin, which lends further support to the FRI\/BL Lac unified model and the theory that low-luminosity radio-loud AGN emit non-thermal radiation produced by the bases of their jets. Additionally, polarization has been detected within the dusty circumnuclear disks, likely due to dichroic transmission. The vectors appear to be tangential to the disks, indicating that magnetism is responsible for the grain alignment. We have further explored the possibility to detect polarimetric signatures from a misaligned radiation beam in FR Is; however, our results point to no such effect existing in the studied sources."}
{"text":"\nThrough the use of integral field spectroscopy in the central 2.5 kpc of the spiral galaxy NGC 4321, we have characterized global features of the peculiar kinematics associated with this region. Applying Fourier techniques to the velocity residuals of $\\rm H\\alpha$ reveals the presence of a nuclear bar. This bar is also seen in the near-infrared, yet has not been visible up to now in optical continuum light dominated by star formation. The two-dimensional distribution of the old stellar population, as derived from the equivalent width map of stellar absorption lines, allows us to detect its optical counterpart. Utilizing the Tremaine-Weinberg method, the pattern speed of the inner bar can be computed - yielding an approximate value of $\\Omega_b$=160$\\pm70\\rm km s^{-1} kpc^{-1}$. Nevertheless, the determination is susceptible to uncertainty and further investigation is needed to confirm its accuracy."}
{"text":"\nThe unique band structure of graphene, which includes a valley structure and Dirac neutrality, exhibit a number of transport phenomena such as quantized Hall effects, weak localization and a minimum conductivity that are not observed in other materials. This makes graphene a strong candidate for spintronic devices, as graphene requires low intrinsic spin orbit interaction and its electron spins do not interact strongly with their adjacent carbon nuclei. Herein, we investigate spin transport and spin precession at room temperature in single layer graphene devices interfacing ferromagnetic cobalt electrodes. Our results disclose bipolar spin signal reflecting the magnetization direction of all four contacts. This suggests coherent spin transport across all four electrodes and spins that remain polarized even at room temperature. Moreover, spin relaxation length is estimated to be between 1.5 - 2 microns with an equivalent spin polarization of the ferromagnetic contacts of about 10%."}

Results suggest that the parameter space of this model has the potential to produce measurable signals at the LHC. We compute the production and decay of the doubly charged Higgs and predict distinct signatures.

{"text":"\nSDSS J080531.84+481233.0 is an unusual L-type dwarf that presents distinct optical (L4) and near-infrared (L9.5) features, previously assigned to condensate cloud effects or low metallicity. After obtaining an improved near-infrared spectrum of this source, I demonstrate the presence of CH4 absorption at 1.6 \u03bcm and a lack of corresponding bands at 2.2 \u03bcm, which are explained by the combined light spectrum of a binary system consisting of an L4.5 and a T5 component. This suggests that SDSS J080531.84+481233.0 is a new binary straddling the L dwarf\/T dwarf transition, adding to insight on the poorly-understood evolutionary phase of brown dwarfs. Discoveries such as this one show that a range of L dwarf\/T dwarf binaries could be detected and characterized without the need for high angular resolution imaging or radial velocity techniques, thus reducing the current detection biases and limitations."}
{"text":"\nBased on high quality abundance data from planetary nebulae (PNe), this study investigates the chemical evolution of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). Using a number of new and existing spectral fluxes, we were able to accurately estimate the age and chemical composition of the progenitor stars giving rise to the PNe. We present an age-metallicity relation in terms of both oxygen and [Fe\/H] for the SMC that suggests a star formation burst occurring in the last 2-3 Gyr. Our results improve the accuracy of nebular abundances, providing useful information for the study of the chemical evolution of the SMC as well as other galaxies in the Local Group."}
{"text":"\nThis paper investigates the relationship between negative and positive energy in a particular quantum state, called the Helfer state, in which a significant amount of negative energy can exist for a limited amount of time. The temporal flux associated with this state allows the quantum inequalities to hold, which limits the magnitude and duration of its negative energy. We then compare these correlations to those of the massless, minimally coupled scalar field in Minkowski vacuum states in two- and four-dimensions. Remarkably, both scenarios show similar behavior; when negative energy is localized in some region, it is accompanied by a positive energy flux into the region. We postulate that this mechanism which keeps the quantum inequalities intact under negative energy is, in some sense, embedded in the fluctuations of the vacuum."}
{"text":"This article presents a theoretical exploration into magnetic toroidal moments in periodic systems, motivated by breaking of time and space reversal symmetries by magnetic dipoles.

Our analysis has strong parallels with the study of electric polarization in bulk periodic systems, and some differences specifically in the magnetic context."}
{"text":"\nThis study involves a field of view of 20' x 20' in Plaut's low extinction window (l,b)=(0 deg,-8 deg) and provides relative proper motion and photographic BV photometry (~21,000 stars, V~20.5 mag) derived from 43 photographic plates over 21 year epoch difference. The proper motion errors range from 1 mas\/yr and field dependent systematics are below 0.2 mas\/yr. Comparing to the 2MASS catalog, ~8,700 stars were identified, resulting in distinctive proper motion distributions for the disk and bulge subsamples. The bulge sample, composed of red giants, exhibits an intrinsic proper motion dispersion of (sigma_l,sigma_b)=(3.39,2.91)+\/-(0.11,0.09) mas\/yr, which is comparable to previous studies with a velocity anisotropy linked to either rotational broadening or tri-axiality. Additionally, the mean distance of the bulge sample was calculated as 6.37+0.87\/-0.77 kpc and its metallicity [M\/H] distribution was determined for a subsample of 60 bulge giants based on calibrated photometric indices. The [M\/H] presented a peak value at [M\/H]~-0.1 with extended metal poor tail and around 30% of stars with supersolar metallicity, but no change in proper motion dispersion. Lastly, CCD UBVRI photometry for the entire proper-motion sample (~21,000 stars) is to be acquired."}
{"text":"\nExamining the case of three rotating tidal dwarf galaxies, Bournaud et al. (2007) put forth evidence for their dark matter dominated nature. This goes against the grain of the currently accepted cold dark matter (CDM) framework, leading us to consider the potential implications of modifying Newtonian dynamics (MOND). We confirm that the TDG rotation curves are consistent under MOND if their inclinations are taken into account as initially postulated by Bournaud et al., without any additional parameters required. Further, our results suggest that Newtonian dynamics is insufficient to explain the observed rotation curves of the TDGs, while MOND can do so with marked success. This study of TDGs thus presents us with the opportunity to examine the efficacy of such modified dynamics in a fundamental physics sense."}
{"text":"\nThis article presents a new evaluation of the cosmological constant, exploring a dark energy scenario with forceful implications which astronomers and laboratory scientists can test simultaneously. The dark energy has a sub-gravitational connection with matter, features a logarithmic self-interaction potential tuneable to an order of magnitude of $10^{-3}{\\rm eV}$, and also has a mass that is contingent upon the surrounding energy density. The forces of this field can be limited below applicable limits thanks to 'chameleon-mimicry', where only the surfaces of mass constituents, with a thickness of $1\/m_\\phi$, can transmit effective long-range forces. After inflation and reheating the field will be relativistic and, with the slowing of the Hubble friction, rise to a value approximating the Planck scale. This may result in a comparatively stronger gravity in space than  on Earth. In the span of the matter era, it can interact with non-relativistic matter to dredge a depth near the Planck scale, yet, because of its sub-gravitational connection with matter, it will stay away from this depth until the energy density drops to roughly $10^{-12}$ ${\\rm eV}^4$. Then the field will commence rolling to the minimum, bringing about a period of cosmic accelerating expansion. Potent indications of this situation could be a non-$-1$ dark energy equation of state, a greater gravity in dilute mediums that could affect BBN and be mistaken as an excess of dark matter or sub-millimeter corrections to Newton's law near present-day laboratory limits."}
{"text":"We analyze the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati model to investigate the stability of its self-accelerating universe. We introduce a bubble which connects the conventional branch and the self-accelerating branch of the model. In our study, a 2-brane serves as a wall between the two separated universes. Despite constructing an instanton in the thin wall approximation to describe the process, our analysis demonstrates that it cannot be physically realized in the O(4) symmetric universe. Such a process can only be facilitated by the introduction of negative tension bubble walls. As a result, the  self-accelerating universe does not decay into the conventional branch. We discuss various other kinds of bubbles capable of mediating the process."}
{"text":"\nWe examine the current CMB data to assess the potential it has for accurately determining the form of the primordial power spectrum produced during inflation. To investigate the broad spectrum of shapes, we utilize the flow formalism, which is an approach to random model development, along with numerical integration of the mode equations of quantum fluctuation. The most current WMAP data displays a thorough variation of possible spectra, including strongly running spectra from rapid inflaton field production and simpler power-law spectra from mellow inflaton fields, both of which provide comparable fits to the data. However, the data struggles to constrain the spectrum in parts of the space where error due to cosmic variance is large (k < 0.01 h{\\rm Mpc}^{-1}). Out of the models which are statistically indistinguishable, some possess strong running at larger scales yet little running at smaller scales, predicting values for the tensor-to-scalar ratio that lie outside the 2-(\\sigma) confidence interval, making room for models with simpler parameterizations."}
{"text":"\nA structural analysis of fifteen years ago categorized the hormone insulin and the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (RB) as able to associate with one another. Subsequently, a peptide corresponding to the RB binding site for insulin was developed and coined as the MCR peptide. Subsequent trials have proven several such MCR peptide variants to be restraining in human cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo with one peptide, the MCR-10, capable of disrupting the insulin-RB complex formation. To further investigate the insulin-RB interaction, this study used an immunoprecipitation approach which found evidence of the dimer in A549 human non-small cell lung cancer cells. Additionally, MCR-4 or MCR-10 (both possessing antiproliferative properties) were found to disrupt this dimer much more so than a control peptide. This provided further evidence for the occurrence of the insulin-RB dimer in such cells as well as proposing it a target for antineoplastic MCR peptides."}
{"text":"\nUsing the ACS camera on the Hubble Space Telescope, photometry of over 5,000 red-giant stars in the outer halo of NGC 3379, a classic normal giant elliptical and member of the Leo-group, was obtained. After compiling the metallicity distribution function (MDF) for the field stars located 33kpc from the galaxy center, distinctive properties of NGC 3379's outer halo emerged. The MDF was broad and flat, with metal-poor stars dominating in the outermost region. With our ACS field centered at a projected distance equivalent to 12 effective radii, we believe that giant E\/S0 galaxies in general will have low-metallicity subpopulations, but that in order to observe them more distant photometry will be required."}
{"text":"\nWe have used the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) to measure (V,I) photometry for about 57,000 red-giant stars within the halo of the Leo elliptical galaxy NGC 3377.

Our results show that the metallicity distribution function (MDF) of the stars peaks at [m\/H] ~ -0.6$, but with very few stars having metallicities smaller than log [m\/H] = -1.5$. There is a limited number of stars found above [m\/H] = -0.3$, however this could be because of the magnitude of photometric completeness. NGC 3377 appears to have an age-metallicity relationship which lies between the dwarf ellipticals and the large giants. We have found no strong indicator which suggests there is a considerable population of young stars (<3 Gy) in the halo."}
{"text":"\nThis article examines the quantum uncertainty of transverse position that emerges from small-scale spacetime fluctuations, presumed to be at the Planck level. This indeterminacy introduces angular orientation indeterminacy within particle trajectories, and so detrimentally affects the metric of a flat spacetime. This effect is described as a nonvanishing quantum commutation relation between transverse position operators along a null trajectory. The same effect can be deduced from black hole evaporation necessitating unitarity. The outcome is referred to as a universal holographic quantum spacetime noise, which carries a constant magnitude regardless of the frequency. The power of this effect is estimated to be directly measurable via interferometers such as LIGO and LISA."}

We also identify mechanisms that initiate chaos, and analyze the associated bifurcations in electron trajectories as a result of commensurate Bloch and cyclotron frequencies.

This sample contains approximately 80,000 bright primaries with 178,000 associated satellites. We find that the satellite system show an overall good matching with the expected behavior for LCDM models, and that these primary galaxies can be recognized with systems of \u2018fossil\u2019 groups. Additionally, the L_{host} \\sigma_{sat}^3 relation holds for truly isolated primaries. We further point out some problems associated with satellite systems selected by simple mass considerations, instead of considering the primary surroundings."}
{"text":"\nThe purpose of this study was to understand the connection between the solar chromosphere and the transition region by examining the activity of certain jets in the transition region. In order to study this, images that were taken simulataenously in Hydrogen-alpha (H-alpha) and C IV (ultraviolet) were carefully aligned. It was found that the so-called \"dynamic fibrils\" (jet-like features in the chromosphere) were seen as an absorption in the H-alpha line, which then transitioned from blue to red in the line. Moreover, some but not all of these dynamic fibrils also appeared as bright features in the C IV images appearing at or beyond the peak of the dimming of the H-alpha line. The results suggest that some of the plasma connected to dynamic fibrils was heated to transition-region temperatures."}
{"text":"\nIn this study, we examine the potential of finding elementary excitations with fractional quantum numbers in a physical model of spin-1\/2 spatially anisotropic frustrated Heisenberg antiferromagnets in two dimensional space. We have obtained an effective Schr\\\"odinger equation which is effective in the weak interchain-coupling regime and compare its prediction with inelastic neutron scattering results. We observe that these antiferromagnets demonstrate two types of excitations: spinons from each chain and triplon bound states of spinon pairs which are formed due to their propagating nature for the purpose of kinetic energy optimization. Conclusively, we believe triplons to be common features of spatially anisotropic frustrated antiferromagnets."}
{"text":"\nBy applying Fourier analysis, we examine the dynamic relationship between the chromosphere and the transition region of active-region plage, whether it is mossy or non-mossy. We utilize image sequences gathered by the Transition Region And Coronal Explorer (TRACE) in different ultraviolet and extreme ultraviolet passbands. The results of this analysis show that in the non-mossy plage, there is a zero phase difference between 1550 and 171 A. For mossy plage, there is an inclined trend in the phase difference spectra when the frequency rises, with no phase difference beyond the 4-6 mHz rate. The phase difference diagrams between 171 and 195 A is unusually shallow at 3 mHz and then again turns to no phase difference afterwards. We believe that the same resemblance between the UV and EUV bands are credited to the collaboration of the C IV resonance lines in 1550 and 1600 A, whereas the steep incline in the low frequencies make evident the presence of upward-travelling disturbances. This trend turning to zero phase difference at greater frequencies is likely due to the obscuration of the hot loop's foot points by oscillating fibrils in the higher frequencies. With these results, it may be suggested that there is a connection between chromospheric and coronal heating mechanisms that involves the slow-mode magnetosonic disturbance."}

Potential methods that can be implemented to improve accuracy when kinematic or quasi-kinematic scattering approximations are utilized are discussed.

Lastly, this paper encourages the sharing of nanocrystal-specific data on the internet and offers potential infrastructure solutions to do so. This same paper has been accepted for international publication in a journal specialising in the structure of nanocrystals."}
{"text":"\nThis article examines changes in the generation interval, which is the amount of time between the initial infection of an individual and when they passed it on to someone else. We discussed a stochastic model for SIR epidemics and were able to deduce that the mean generation interval decreases under the condition where susceptible individuals come into contact with multiple potential infectious sources. We refer to this as 'global competition' and with such competition, mean generation interval contracts as the rate of infection increases. Additionally, we talk about 'local competition' where transmission occurs rapidly within a cluster of contacts. Through simulations and other means, we demonstrated that infectious contact hazards can be used for estimating the effective reproductive rate in an epidemic, which then follows through to partial likelihoods for epidemic data similar to those used in survival analysis. This gives rise to a new area of methodological research in the field of infectious disease epidemiology."}
{"text":"\nThis paper examines the performance evaluation of encounter-based worm interactions based on mobile node characteristics such as cooperation, immunization, and on-off behavior. A distributed counter-worm mechanism is established which relies upon automated beneficial worm generation to impede worm propagation in such networks. To study the impact of these node properties, simulations are conducted to validate the proposed model. Results indicate that immunization is the most effectual way to restrict worm infection, whereas cooperation can reduce the level of such infections. Additionally, on-off behavior affects the timing of the infection instead of the overall level of it. Using realistic mobile network measurements, it is observed that trends are consistent with the model but magnitudes are significantly different. Our findings highlight the need to develop counter-worm protocols tailored to the dynamics of encounter-based networks."}
{"text":"This study investigated the chemical compositions of 19 Type II Cepheids in the Galactic field, which consisted of both short and long-period variables. This is the first extensive chemical abundance analysis of these stars, discovering the presence of contamination of their atmospheres with products of $\\mathrm{3\\alpha}$-process and CN-cycling. The BL Her stars were identified to have Na overabundances that were not seen in the W Vir stars. The W Vir stars, however, exhibited a range of abundance anomalies not seen in the BL Her stars, which were attributed to dust-gas separation leading to atmospheres containing lower than expected amounts of elements of high condensation temperature. Possible explanations of the contrasting abundance anomalies of the two types of Type II Cepheids were presented in the context of their evolution from the blue horizontal branch."}

{"text":"\nIn this article, we analyze power allocation algorithms for fixed-rate transmission over Nakagami-m non-ergodic block-fading channels with perfect transmitter and receiver channel state information and discrete input signal constellations. We determine the optimal short-term scheme with an SNR exponent of m times the Singleton bound and present significant gains available from long-term power constraints, including the capability to achieve zero outage when an SNR exponent greater than one is achieved by the corresponding short-term method. In cases where the SNR exponent is lesser than one, we compute the corresponding long-term SNR exponent and show that, unfortunately, zero outage cannot be accomplished. We further discuss simple, sub-optimal power allocation schemes that are viable with regards to complexity in the case of system implementation and indicate the effectiveness of these techniques with the use of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing."}
{"text":"\nThis study examines the oscillatory secular modes of thermal micropulses in stars with a mass range of 2.5 to 3.5 solar masses when they enter into their helium-burning shell during an ignition phase. To conduct linear stability analyses, a variety of 3 solar-mass star models were used in a state without thermal equilibirum. The thermal micropulses appear to be the nonlinear finite amplitude realization of the oscillatory secular instability that persists over the entire thermal pulse episode. This suggests that the cyclic nature of thermal pulses is rooted in the linear instabilities."}

{"text":"This paper examines the effects of temporal white noise on stochastic analog neural networks and their retrieval processes as observed from a neurobiological and biophysical perspective. To do this without relying on an energy concept, the self-consistent signal-to-noise analysis (SCSNA) replaces the traditional replica method. Investigating the SCSNA'sapplication requires knowledge of the Thouless-Anderson-Palmer (TAP) equation, a tool for deterministic networks absent of energy. Research into this equation is relatively sparse; this paper seeks to resolve that by introducing a hybrid methodology, combining the cavity method and the SCSNA, and thus obtain a set of order parameter equations for networks with synaptic noise as embodied in the TAP equation."}
{"text":"\nThis research examines linear series on a general curve of genus $g$, where the images are excluded due to the properties of their secant planes. Utilizing an extension of Brill-Noether theory to pairs of linear series, a general curve has been proven to not possess any linear series with extraordinary secant planes when the total number of such series is finite. Additionally, a one-parameter family of linear series with exceptional secant planes was partially resolved by using tautological classes associated with the family and a hypothetical formula. An application of this study, which relates to the extremal occurrence of $d$-secant $(d-2)$-planes to $(2d-1)$-dimensional series in the investigation of Hilbert schemes of points on surfaces, further explains the nonzero nature and asymptotics in $d$ of the number of linear series with exceptional secant planes on a general curve with a one-dimensional family of linear series by utilizing hypergeometric series."}
{"text":"The article provides a different perspective on the hierarchy problem by showing how a theory with a large number of species of the quantum fields leads to an inevitable hierarchy between the masses of the species and the Planck scale. Using the physics of black holes, we prove a lower bound for the Planck mass in a large-N limit theory which is given by N times the squared mass of the Z_2-conserved species of the quantum fields. Another consequence of this proof is that any quantum charge that is exactly conserved, but not associated with a long-range classical field, must be bounded maximumly by N, which is determined by the ratio of the Planck and the unit charge masses squared. Specifically, global U(1) `baryon number' can be limited to Z_N at most by gravity. The same restraints may take effect on discrete gauge symmetry and ultra massive quantum hair of black hole. Finally, the gravitational-coupled N-species sector presented in the article can be tested in LHC."}

{"text":"\nThis paper considers the Marcus-Lushnikov process, a stochastic particle system in which each particle is characterized by mass. We investigate the implications of a strongly gelling kernel, $K(x,y)=x^\\alpha y + x y^\\alpha$, where gelation occurs, resulting in the emergence of giant particles. Two possible hydrodynamic limits then arise: the Smoluchowski equation, in which the large particles are static, and the Flory equation, wherein the huge particles are reactive. Using a specific cut-off in the Marcus-Lushnikov process, we show that the possible limits solve either the Smoluchowski or the Flory equation. Further, we also explore the asymptotic behaviour of the largest particle in the Marcus-Lushnikov process sans cut-off, displaying that there is only one giant particle which asymptotically represents the lost mass of the Flory equation solution."}
{"text":"\nOur new N-body algorithm enables the accurate simulation of star clusters in galaxies, using both direct and tree-based methods. The internal motion of the star cluster is calculated accurately using the direct Hermite scheme and individual timesteps, while the tree code uses a second-order leapfrog integrator to model all other motions. The two techniques are combined in an MVS scheme that maintains a symplectic leapfrog approach for the Hamiltonian corresponding to everything other than the internal movement of the star cluster. We tested our algorithm with simulations of star clusters in their parent galaxies, finding excellent agreement with results from the direct scheme. For larger models ($N=2\\times 10^6$), our calculation speed was seven times faster than if using the direct scheme."}
{"text":"The ignition delay times of a cyclohexane-oxygen-argon and cyclopentane-oxygen-argon mixture have been measured using a shock tube. Temperatures from 1230 to 1800 K and pressures from 7.3 to 9.5 atm were obtained with the use of reflected shock waves. It has been revealed that cyclopentane is ten times less reactive than cyclohexane, as the observed autoignition delay times were considerably higher for the C5 compound than the C6 when a certain temperature was used. To accurately reproduce these results, a detailed mechanism for the combustion of both cyclohexane and cyclopentane was proposed. Existing software, EXGAS, was updated and used to develop the models. This was done by incorporating new types of generic reactions and correlating rate constants. Ab initio calculations were conducted to further gain an understanding of the rate constants applicable to the oxidation of cyclopentane, while reaction pathways were gained from flow rate and sensitivity analyses."}

{"text":"\nExploring the limits of CP violation in neutrino oscillations can be done via measurements of flavor ratios of astrophysical neutrino fluxes, which are sensitive to the two associated yet unknown parameters $\\theta_{13}$ and $\\delta$. This paper brings attention to the potential of measuring an upper bound on $|\\cos\\delta|$ which is lesser than 1 if a lower bound is established on $\\theta_{13}$ by reactor experiments. In order for this to happen, the uncertainty of the two other mixing parameters $\\theta_{12}$ and $\\theta_{23}$ needs to be reduced by approximately 2 times, and neutrino fluxes from multiple muon-damped sources must be identified with an accuracy of 10% minimum. If this is to be achieved by km^3 detectors, the neutrino flux must align with the Waxman-Bahcall boundary. Hence, these requirements make it essential to consider significantly larger neutrino telescopes with energy thresholds of the order of 100 TeV than IceCube."}
{"text":"\nResearch into exotic states, such as glueball, hybrid and multi-quark states, is one of the most important aspects of high energy physics. Transitions such as $\\psi(ns)\\to \\psi(ms)+\\pi\\pi$ and $\\Upsilon(ns)\\to \\Upsilon(ms)+\\pi\\pi$ provide valuable information about these hybrid states. This study examines these transition modes from the theoretical perspective established by Yan and Kuang, exploring the intermediate states between the two gluon-emissions, and ultimately allowing for the determination of their mass spectra. Through comparisons of potentials for hybrids, obtained via this scenario with lattice results, the mass spectra of the hybrids are predicted as 4.23 GeV (for charmonium) and 10.79 GeV (for bottonium). This differs from what has been measured in recent experiments, potentially signifying that hybrids mix with regular quarkonia to constitute physical states."}
{"text":"\nBy investigating a class of homogenous, but anisotropic cosmologies known as the Bianchi Model, we examine the implications of the Bianchi Type VIIh parameter choices for the CMB polarization signal. We find that the peak polarization signal is near 1.2 micro K, within the range of a previously advocated, best-fit temperature anisotropy model. Upon comparison with current WMAP observations, it is found that the Bianchi Type VIIh model is consistent with the observed E-mode power, but lacks the expected parity-violating correlations and B-mode polarisation; the latter two observations cast doubt on the model as an explanation for the large-angle anomalies. Further consideration to the full range of dynamical degrees of freedom present in Bianchi Model VIIh is nonetheless included with the reminder that we are not able to definitively reject the anisotropy explanation at this time."}
{"text":"This paper analyzes the Laplacian instability of planar streamer ionization fronts, in which the spatial decay of the initial condition of the front dynamically selects one specific long-term attractor from a continuous family. To characterize the transverse stability, a framework involving stable and unstable manifolds in a weighted space is presented. This framework is used in a numerical dynamical systems method to calculate the dispersion relation as an eigenvalue problem and derive the dispersion curves for varying electron diffusion constants and electric fields in front of the front. The initial value problem is confirmed by numerical solutions and the dispersion relation is further supported by analytical expressions in the limit of small and large wave numbers, along with a fit formula for intermediate wave numbers. This empirical fit implies that the smallest unstable wavelength of the Laplacian instability is proportional to the diffusion length of the leading edge of the pulled ionization front."}
{"text":"This article examines the effect of C and\/or N enhancement on the stellar structure and evolution of low-metallicity stars in the Asymptotic Giant Branch phase. In particular, we focus on the usage of appropriate opacity coefficients, to account for the potential C enrichment caused by the third dredge up, and the possible N enrichment due to a cool bottom process or by the ingestion of protons into the convective zone post-thermal pulse. Through calculation of up-to-date stellar models, our paper illustrates the changes manifested in the physical and chemical characteristics of these stars due to the adjusted opacities."}

Our results suggest that for a fiducial DM particle, only a handful of larger masses may be detected with a 1-year exposure time. Furthermore, depending on the assumed parameters, scenarios where micro-clumps can be detected may be severely hindered by the observed gamma-ray background."}
{"text":"\nWe conducted a wide-area survey of the young (~100-150 Myr) open cluster, Blanco1, with the CFH12K camera, in order to gain insight into its low-mass population and to measure its mass function across the stellar\/substellar boundary. Using this data and a statistical approach, along with infrared photometry and optical spectroscopy, we identified 57% of Blanco1's cluster members in the range 0.03-0.6 Mo, including 30-40 brown dwarfs. Our findings indicate that mass segregation may have occurred in the cluster, and we incorporated this into our analysis of the mass distribution, which was well-fitted by a single power-law with an index of alpha=0.69 +\/- 0.15 over the range 0.03Mo to 0.6Mo, and a log-normal function with m0=0.36 +\/- 0.07Mo and sigma=0.58 +\/- 0.06 throughout an even greater mass domain from 0.03Mo to 3Mo. Through comparisons of the Blanco1 mass function with those of other young open clusters and the galactic disc, we produced evidence that the initial mass function (IMF) need not be reliant on established conditions. We discussed the implications that this has on various theories concerning the origin of the mass distribution."}
{"text":"\nWe present a theoretical study of the Aharonov-Bohm rings made of graphene. These rings display an interesting effect due to the externally applied magnetic field - the orbital degeneracy originating from the two valleys can be broken, even in the absence of intervalley scattering. We explore this phenomenon and its effects on the persistent current of the ring, as well as on the conductance. Analytically, we confirm this prediction with a model that considers a circular ring with a smooth boundary and a space-dependent mass term. Numerically, we consider a ring with a hexagonal form and lattice-terminated zigzag edges. We find that this type of ring displays a similar behaviour, with the orbital degeneracy being controllable via the flux."}

{"text":"\nThis study examines the chemical makeup of two post-AGB stars, IRAS08281-4850\nand IRAS14325-6428, through UVES and EMMI spectra in order to analyze the\nenrichment of s-process elements. Upon finding both objects strongly enriched in\ncarbon and s-process elements, as well as evidence pointing to a history of\nheavy mass-loss, IRAS08281 and IRAS14325 appear to be prototypical examples of A-type post-AGB stars with significant s-process\nenrichment.

{"text":"\nRecent radial velocity measurements suggest that the two giant planets detected orbiting HD 73526 are in a 2:1 resonance. This stable configuration, however, was not supported by numerical integration. Our analysis indicates an underlying chaotic behavior of the system, a feature which is rarely present in other resonant extrasolar planetary systems. \n\nIn this article, we illustrate formation scenarios leading to orbital solutions which can explain stable resonant configurations for HD 73526. Through the Systemic Console (www.oklo.org), numerical integration, and Relative Lyapunov indicator, we are able to generate two sets of non-chaotic orbital solutions. We further demonstrate the effect of migration and scattering on the final orbital settings by combining gravitational N-body simulations with simulations of gravitational forces derived from protoplanetary disks. Finally, we compare the dynamics of HD 73526 with other known systems, such as HD 128311, to further support our findings.\n\nOur research illustrates that resonant structures surrounding HD 73526 are indeed possible, and can be explained through the combination of planetary migration and perturbative events. This suggests a model of planetary evolution which merges sudden perturbations and migrational effects."}
{"text":"We demonstrate that for the Glauber dynamics of a p-spin Sherrington--Kirkpatrick model, the clock process becomes an $\\alpha$-stable subordinator when the rescaled time scale is shorter than the equilibration time of the system. This phenomenon leads to aging of the dynamics, with the time-time correlation function converging to the arcsine law of the $\\alpha$-stable subordinator. This result suggests that the mean-field spin glass conforms with the universality of the REM model, and extends this universality to Bouchaud's REM-like trap model. Intriguingly, the SK model (p=2) shows a distinct universality class."}
{"text":"\nBy using the tools of effective field theory, this paper provides a thorough examination of the fragmentation functions D_{a\/H}(x, m_Q) of hadrons H containing a heavy quark Q (with a=Q,Q_bar,q,q_bar,g). This analysis integrates out pair production of virtual and real heavy quarks and reduces the fragmentation functions to a nonperturbative function, singling out their short-distance dependence on x. It also factorizes the remaining  function for large x into a universal function defined in heavy-quark effective theory and its residual dependence on the heavy-quark mass. Furthermore, the system's evolution equation is solved with analytical approaches to resum the large logarithms of mu\/m_Q. This paper also explains that prior attempts to extract log^n(1-x) terms from the fragmentation function D_{Q\/H}(x,m_Q) cannot perfectly parse out short- from long-distance effects."}

Notably, component A has a significantly slower rotational braking than B and C, suggesting decreasing spins with late-M spectral type. Additionally, component B has a magnetic flux that is twice as strong as component C at a similar spin rate, implying an alternate topology of the field as the explanation for the weak braking in low mass objects."}

{"text":"In this study, we explore the intricate details of high-order harmonic emission in diatomic molecules when treated within the framework of the strong-field approximation. We focus our attention on the quantum-interference effects from various electron orbits, entailing those between one or two centers. In this context, we evaluate the influence of the initial and final electronic configurations, as well as the effect of the gauge choice. We determine that potential energy shifts, which are exclusive to the length-gauge SFA, are necessary to account for the overall maxima and minima in spectrum; while their presence can distort physical interpretation of the interference patterns, they remain important. Conversely, if no potential shifts are present, i.e. dressed electronic bound states in the length gauge, or undressed bound states in the velocity gauge, the interference patterns break down. To circumvent this issue, an alternative route proposes the use of additional attosecond-pulse trains to re-establish the electron's pathway to the continuum. Lastly, a comparative analysis between the pure monochromatic case and the with-attoseconds setting suggest that the patterns are mainly due to interference between the electron orbits finishing at different centers, regardless of the number of centers it involves."}
{"text":"\nExtensive long slit spectroscopic analysis of the polar-ring galaxy AM1934-563 facilitated by the Southern Africa Large Telescope (SALT) has been conducted. The spectroscopy focused on emission from Ha, [NII], & [SII], as well as absorption lines from NaI thought to come from stars in the galaxy. This examination resulted in the generation of rotation curves for the gaseous and stellar components which extended 8 kpc from the centre. These curves were compared and found to differ from those of the polar ring. Moreover, a low velocity dispersed, faint, Ha-emitting dwarf HII galaxy was identified as the fourth member of the galaxy group to which AM1934-563 belongs. Consideration was also given to an existing proposition that the object was a by-product of a major merger as well as an alternative 'slow accretion' scenario of cold intergalactic gas."}

{"text":"\nBy studying a lattice model of polymers, we explored the effects of altering the strength of monomer-monomer interactions which vary depending on the \"hydrogen-like\" formations of their local configurations. By making use of Monte Carlo simulations of lengths up to 256, we have mapped the phase diagram of these parameters and the transitions they undergo. When all the polymer interactions are equal, the classical $\\theta$-point collapse transition is observed when the temperature is lowered, which leads to the creation of an isotropic liquid-drop state known as the collapsed globule. Whereas, when the hydrogen-like interactions strongly dominate, it produces an anisotropic folded (solid-like) phase. We have found that depending on the parameters, two phase transitions can happen when the temperature is reduced, with the second one being the globule-to-crystal transition, which has shown to be continuous in two dimensions based on field-theory arguments regarding Hamiltonian walks, but first order in three."}
{"text":"\nUsing data from Spitzer's 24, 70 and 160 micron bands, we studied the infrared characteristics of high-redshift galaxies in the southern Extended Chandra Deep Field in connection with K-band-selected galaxies, Multiwavelength Survey by Yale-Chile photometric redshift data, and X-ray activity. Through stacking analysis, we determined the average 70 and 160 micron flux densities for galaxies with 1.5 < z < 2.5, both with respect to the 24 micron flux density and for red rest-frame infrared colours and X-ray detections. Our results indicate that galaxies in this redshift range with S(24) = 0.053-0.250 micro-Jy showed L(IR) values similar to those of 24 micron flux densities. However, those with S(24) > 0.250 micro-Jy had higher S(70)\/S(24) flux ratios, possibly due to emission from hot dust heated by AGN. Lastly, our analysis suggests that star-forming galaxies have star-formation efficiencies and feedback mechanisms comparable to our galaxy's local counterparts, with L(IR) < 6 x 10^12 solar luminosities corresponding to <1000 solar masses per year. Such galaxies appear to be rare, at surface densities approximately 30 +\/- 10 per square degree and a volume density of ~2 +\/- 1 x 10^-6 Mpc^-3 over 1.5 < z < 2.5."}

Compared to traditional and other existing instruction, the curriculum led to improved learning of the first goal. However, most students had difficulty making logical inferences from their observations. This suggests a more general difficulty in reasoning from observations."}
{"text":"\nThis study utilizes the Swedish ESO Submillimeter Telescope to observe 1.2-mm dust emission emanating from eighteen luminous IRAS point sources suspected to be young massive star forming regions associated with CS(2-1) emission. It is found that the associated 1.2-mm sources display unique physical parameters, such as 0.4 pc size, 30 K dust temperature, 2x10^3 Msun mass, 3x10^23 cm^-2 column density and 4x10^5 cm^-3 density. Also, many single-peaked structures were identified, generally comprised of a bright, tightly concentrated peak surrounded by a faint, extended envelope. Power-law intensity profiles fit well with the observed radial intensity profiles, hinting at these sources having centrally condensed, radial density profiles with power-law indices ranging from 1.5-2.2. Lastly, the evidence suggests that massive stars are typically formed at the peaks of these concentrated cores."}
{"text":"This article presents a theoretical resolution to the issue of magnetic reconnection in high energy plasmas. Established theories of the drift-tearing modes predict practically inaccessible excitation thresholds for observed macroscopic reconnected magnetic structures (islands) in weakly collisional and well confined plasmas. Through a singular perturbation analysis with three asymptotic regions and two small parameters, it is determined that mesoscopic modes, depending on the ratio of the transverse to the longitudinal thermal conductivity, are responsible for creating a large scale magnetic reconnection. This result builds on the background of coherent, collisionless microscopic reconnecting modes driven by the electron temperature gradient, forming a sequence of adjacent strings of magnetic islands."}
{"text":"\nThis paper presents the results of a survey for extrasolar planets orbiting intermediate-mass stars in two open clusters, NGC 2423 and NGC 4349. The observations were taken with the Coralie and HARPS spectrographs to obtain high precision radial velocity measurements and search for giant planets. In total, 115 red giants were studied, with masses between 1.5-4 solar masses. After assessing any stellar jitter, two low-mass companions were detected, a giant planet and a brown dwarf, each with a distinct orbital period and minimum mass. These findings add to the current knowledge of extrasolar planetary systems, revealing that the frequency of massive planets is larger around intermediate-mass stars. This implies a higher likelihood of more planetary masses forming in proportion to the mass of a protoplanetary disk."}
{"text":"This paper introduces an innovative new type of thermonuclear reactor for the aerospace industry. It consists of an inner layer of Prism Reflectors (PR) that multi-reflect heat and laser radiation precisely back onto the fuel target capsule, as well as a plasma reflector that reflects Bremsstrahlung radiation. These novel features reduce radiation losses and create higher levels of radiation pressure, while also increasing the reaction time by hundreds of times. The impressive results are enabling a decrease in the size, cost and weight of a thermonuclear reactor, while still reaching the coveted Lawson criteria. The study is being presented as paper AIAA-2006-7225 to the Space-2006 Conference in San Jose, CA, USA."}
{"text":"\nRecent observations have illuminated the existence of some repulsive form of gravity within the Universe, causing it to accelerate its expansion instead of slowing down. This form of energy, referred to as dark energy, is the source of roughly three-quarters of the entire Universe, and is incredibly hard to explain with standard science. While the most plausible explanation is the energy of the vacuum of quantum mechanics, it far surpasses what we know about this form of energy. Several alternate theories exist to explain dark energy, from light scalar fields to vast networks of topological defects. An alternative idea is to look towards unconfirmed theories of gravitational physics. Upcoming experiments in both cosmology and laboratories will help to confirm or debunk these theories, as well as test the limits of the current standard model. In essence, dark energy represents the most prominent example of physics outside the standard model, and an immense mystery in all of science."}
{"text":"Recent experiments on the high temperature cuprate superconductors have uncovered apparently contradictory results regarding the charge and momentum of the zero energy electrons in the metallic state between the antiferromagnet and the superconductor. This paper introduces a theory of novel states of matter, called 'algebraic charge liquids', which explain these discrepancies and explore the dependence of the density of the superconducting electrons on the total electron density. We identify a number of unique predictions for further experiments."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate how the characteristics of X-ray scaling relationships for galaxy\nclusters are modified by selection biases and intrinsic covariance between measurable properties. To this end, we model log-normal covariance between luminosity (L) and temperature (T) minus mass (M) under the assumption of a power-law evoluted mean relation. Depending on the survey flux limit, shallow surveys will lead to anomalous deviations in the \\lm and \\lt relations while deep surveys ($10^{-14} \\cgsflux$) will have no bias. Additionally, we determine formulas for the low-order moments of the luminosity distribution at a fixed temperature, further demonstrating that the \\lt relation, as observed in flux-limited samples, displays sensitivity to the correlation coefficient specified by \\lt covariance. Lastly, we addressed the conundrum that \\lt covariation alters the behaviour of halo counts and the average luminosity in a way comparable to intrinsic population evolution."}
{"text":"\nThe emergence of spintronic applications in metal-based structures has enabled measurable improvements of computer hard drives and magnetic random access memories, often relying on magnetoresistive effects and a linear-response theory to understand spin-polarised transport. On the contrary, semiconductor-based spintronics and spin-polarised transport in related structures could offer stronger intrinsic nonlinearities for signal processing and digital logic, yet lacking a concrete theoretical foundation. This article explores ways to conceive bipolar spintronic devices in which electrically-injected carriers of both polarity (electron and holes) create a coupling between spin and charge - an endeavour which is not yet completely achieved. It details a comprehensive theoretical foundation for this class of structures and pinpoints several novel effects due to the combined influence of nonequilibrium spin and equilibrium magnetization in two- and three-terminal architectures."}
{"text":"\nThis paper analyzes and proposes an alternative approach for the packaging of radiochemical solar neutrino data from a Bayesian perspective. Current practice suggests estimates of flux and error margins are derived through a maximum-likelihood procedure from the decay events of the analysis chamber. This procedure has been shown to have several shortcomings, such as the occurrence of negative flux estimates and the probability distribution functions implied by these estimates extending into negative territory. It also results in the overall flux estimate of a sequence of runs differing drastically from estimates made by a global analysis of all timing data taken together. The suggested alternative is believed to be free from such practical issues, thus allowing for a more adequate summary of the data while also ensuring information is not lost."}
{"text":"This article investigates the fundamental relationship between linear pre-metric electrodynamics and the emergence of a light cone structure. We build a general covariant framework for describing electromagnetic properties in spacetime using the 'constitutive tensor of the vacuum'. We show that the Fresnel equation describing the local behavior of electromagnetic waves depends on the form of the constitutive tensor. Under certain circumstances, a light cone structure is induced, and this structure is related to the dual operators defined by the constitutive tensor and the existence of a conformal metric. We establish closure and symmetry of the constitutive tensor as conditions for the emergence of a conformal metric, and we explore what happens when the depth of the symmetry is relaxed. Additionally, we demonstrate how the metric components can be derived from the constitutive tensor, when these two conditions are met."}
{"text":"\nOur research has looked closely at how the cycle of interstellar dust plays out in galaxies of differing morphological types. By applying chemical evolution models to locations such as the solar neighbourhood, elliptical galaxies and dwarf irregular galaxies, we have been able to explore the cosmic dust production, destruction and accretion rates.  This has enabled us to investigate the effect of variable star formation histories on this cycle, and to successfully address the 'Fe discrepancy' seen in the hot gaseous halos of local ellipticals and observe the chemical abundances of Lyman Break Galaxies.The results of this study form an invaluable resource that can be used to support future spectro-photometric investigations of galaxies."}
{"text":"This article assesses the role of curvature in relation to the contraction of Lie algebra pseudo-orthogonal so(p,q), analysing the zero-curvature limit of constant curvature homogenous spaces. By using quantum deformations of Lie algebras, a family of spaces of non-constant curvature is constructed.

{"text":"\nA Mathematica script has been written to simplify the calculation of nuclear matrix elements of multipole operators arising from semileptonic electroweak interactions, such as \\beta decay, \\mu capture, and charged- and neutral-current neutrino reactions, as well as electron scattering. These multipole operators are constructed from underlying nuclear charge and three-current operators and are then expressed in a harmonic oscillator basis. The script is able to generate the analytic form of the matrix elements, expressed as finite polynomials in q^2, where q is the magnitude of the three-momentum transfer. This avoids manual calculation, which can be time-consuming for users and also prone to errors and simplifies the calculation of nuclear cross sections and rates. To demonstrate the utility of the script, we use it to calculate the cross section of neutrino scattering on ^{12}C."}
{"text":"\nThis paper looks into the probability of the maximum size of a planar matching and maximum size planar subgraph occuring when a random regular bipartite multigraph is placed in the plane in a standard way. This addresses an important generalisation of Longest Increasing Sequence (LIS)\/ Ulam's problem. We present equations that connect the number of regular bipartite multigraphs with the maximum size planar matching and planar subgraph of at most d edges in terms of restricted lattice walks in Z^d and the number of pairs of standard Young tableaux with the same shape and a descending pattern. Additionally, we explore pattern avoidance in bipartite multigraphs, leading to a generalised Gessel identity for the number of bipipartite 2-regular multigraphs which disregard a monotone pattern."}
{"text":"\nAn examination of ACO 3627, commonly known as the Norma cluster, has been completed to better understand the most massive cluster in the Great Attractor. The radial velocities of numerous cluster members were collected and a mean velocity of 4871 +\/- 54 km\/s and velocity dispersion of 925 km\/s were determined. It was found that the E\/S0 population was offset from the S\/Irr population in the cluster by 'Delta' v = 164 km\/s and the offset increased towards the core. Additionally, two dynamically distinct subgroups were identified in the spiral-population located along the Norma wall. The mass of the cluster within its Abell radius is estimated to be between 1 - 1.1 x 10^15 h^-1_73 M_Sun and a spiral galaxy, WKK 6176, with a 70 kpc X-ray tail exhibits strong interaction with the intracluster medium evidenced by multiple low-brightness filaments."}
{"text":" This article explores the phenomenon of localized linear defect modes in two-dimensional optical lattices due to the guidance of a bandgap. We analytically and numerically investigate different types of defect modes - such as fundamental, dipole, quadrupole and vortex modes - which can emerge from the edges of Bloch bands or the quasi-edge points within them. For weak defects, the distance between the eigenvalues of the defect modes and the edges of the Bloch bands is shown to be exponentially small with the strength of the defect. For well-defined scenarios, such as a localized but strong defect and a non-localized defect, other characteristics of the defect modes are uncovered. For example, the defect modes in repulsive and attractive defects move around the lattice in different ways. Finally, the bifurcation of defect modes from the edges of a continuous spectrum is shown to be an algebraic rather than an exponential process."}
{"text":"\nBy taking advantage of UKIDSS photometric and proper motion measurements, a deep survey of 12 square degrees in the Pleiades star cluster has resulted in the discovery of over 340 high probability proper motion members and 73 candidate brown dwarf members. From colour-magnitude diagrams, 23 substellar multiple system candidates were identified, yielding a binary frequency of 28-44% in the 0.075-0.030 Msun mass range. Comparisons with similar studies suggest similar binary fractions, while tentative estimates of the mass ratios support the hypothesis that binary brown dwarfs tend to exist in near equal-mass systems."}
{"text":"  \nA comprehensive theory is proposed for analyzing Coulomb-induced correlation effects arising in strong-coupling nonlinear optical processes within semiconductor microcavities, which is based on a dynamics-controlled truncation scheme and uses an approach that incorporates the quantization of the electromagnetic field. This technique, which does not require any assumption about the quantum statistics of electronic excitations, extends and updates a previous technique used in the semiclassical context for four-wave mixing in quantum wells. The new method yields dynamical equations for the exciton and photon operators, encompassing the usual semiclassical description of Coulomb interaction effects, in terms of a mean-field term and a non-instantaneous four-particle correlation, and accounting for quantum-optical effects."}
{"text":"\nIn this article, we examine the distributed implementation of standard oracle operators and their associated unidirectional and bidirectional classical and entangling capacities. The standard oracle operator is a unitary operator that coputes a function coherently while maintaining superpositions on a bipartite system - the input and output registers. We present an optimal protocol for bidirectional classical communication with a permutation function, and derive the corresponding capacities of 2log_{2}(M) bits. We also establish the unidirectional classical and entangling capacities as log_{2}(n_{f}) bits\/ ebbits for an arbitrary function f, with n_{f} denoting the number of different values this function can take. The described protocol and associated results facilitate the distributed implementation of the oracle operator."}
{"text":"\nThrough high-resolution ultraviolet spectroscopy obtained with the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), as well as optical spectrum obtained of the white dwarf central star LS V +4621 of Sh 2-216, we are able to analyze the photospheric properties of the star through NLTE model atmosphere techniques. A precise temperature of 95 +\/- 2 kK and surface gravity of log g = 6.9 +\/- 0.2 have been determined from ionization equilibria. Differences in distance found between spectroscopic and parallax have been identified and Mg IV and Ar VI have been identified for the first time in a hydrogen-rich central star. Additionally, abundances of iron group elements such as Cr, Mn, Fe, Co and Ni have been determined. Issues with the Balmer-line problem have been addressed by the treatment of metal opacities in the model-atmosphere calculations. Improvements in reliable atomic data and accurate line broadening tables are necessary for further analysis."}
{"text":"In this article, we present an overview of the growth mechanisms and bonding structures of carbon thin films with Fullerene-like (FL) microstructures. FL is obtained from a three-dimensional network of curves and cross-links between sp2 hybridized graphitic planes, partially resembling the molecular fullerenes. This superstructure creates a strong yet flexible material with a range of advanced mechanical characteristics, including high hardness, high elasticity, low friction, and good wear resistance. Analyzing the curvature, size, and connectivity between the FL can also help customize the material for tribological applications. We concentrate our studies on the formation of carbon nitride thin solid films due to the nitrogen\u2019s useful properties for creating a FL arrangement at lower temperatures compared to its pure carbon counterparts, which have lucrative tribological properties serving as protective coats in magnetic hard disks. We also study the origin of plane curvature, the nature of linkages, and the clustering of sp2 molecules, as well as the growth processes due to chemical re-sputtering and concurrent ion assistance."}
{"text":"\nThrough detailed exploration of non-equilibrium coherence dynamics, we conducted experiments on isolated and coupled degenerate one-dimensional Bose gases. Utilizing dynamic splitting, we created two 1d systems in a phase coherent state, which allowed us to measure the time evolution of the coherence in the local phase shifts of the ensuing interference patterns. Our results showed universal sub-exponential coherence decay in truly isolated systems and non-zero equilibrium values for coupled systems, both in accordance with recent theoretical predictions. Consequently, our study had revealed that 1d Bose gases are optimal for investigating a range of non-equilibrium physical systems, including superconductors, quantum-Hall systems, superfluid Helium, and spin systems."}
{"text":"\nIn this article we analyze the uniqueness of $\\bf C^*$-actions and $\\bf A^1$-fibrations on a Gizatullin surface, which is defined as a normal affine surface $V$ over $\\bf C$ completed by a linear chain of smooth rational curves. Non-Gizatullin surfaces are known to admit at most one $\\bf A^1$-fibration up to an isomorphism of the base, with any associated $\\bf C^*$-action being unique up to conjugation and inverting $\\bf C^*$. We discuss the conjugacy classes of $\\bf A^1$-fibrations on affine toric surfaces and the Danilov-Gizatullin surfaces. We present a criterion in which $\\bf A^1$-fibrations of Gizatullin surfaces are conjugate up to an automorphism of $V$ and the base $S$ and a large subclass of Gizatullin $\\bf C^*$-surfaces on which a $\\bf C^*$-action is essentially unique and with at most two conjugacy classes of $\\bf A^1$-fibrations over $\\bf A^1$."}
{"text":"This article examines how facets come into being as a result of an electomigration force, involving vicinal orientations. Observations have been made through in-situ and ex-situ visualization methods to conclude that the formation of facets involves two stages, initially creating a step density wave with an unchanging wavelength, followed by a much slower process, where a hill and valley feature forms, with a period that is determined by the initial surface orientation. A simple continuum model is used to demonstrate this phenomenon. Additionally, the paper concludes with an analysis that the angular dependence of surface stress may be seen as an outcome from a step model."}
{"text":"This paper investigates how the framework for consistent reasoning must be adapted in circumstances where hypotheses form a continuum, but the amount of evidence accessible is limited. By connecting basic consistency principles related to the preparation and composition of systems, as well as the continuity of probabilities, it is demonstrated that the only method of logically accessing a wide array of hypotheses with finite evidence is quantum theory in a complex Hilbert space. Hence, quantum theory provides a solid basis for dealing with the uncertainty brought on by continous hypotheses."}
{"text":"\nAn analysis at different wavelengths has been conducted for the first time to evaluate the large asymmetry in H$\\alpha$ emission on NGC 891. It was suggested that the higher asymmetry in H$\\alpha$ is due to dust attenuation, requiring additional optical depth for this to be observed. Strips to analyze the asymmetry in different wavelengths were taken, focusing on the North East side of the galaxy and comparing it to the same area on the South West. Results from 24 $\\mu$m emission indicated a small intrinsic star formation asymmetry in NGC 891. This is modelled as a symmetric dust attenuation, with a mid-plane value of $\\tau$ = 0.8 and a scale height of 0.5 kpc, which reaches up to a height of 2 kpc above the plane of the galaxy."}
{"text":"\nAn in-depth study of optical photometry and spectroscopy of 471 Tau, a Hyades K2V+WD system and a potential progenitor of cataclysmic binary systems, was done using MOST (Microvariability & Oscillations of STars) satellite photometry and simultaneous spectroscopy from the David Dunlap Observatory (DDO). Detected low-intensity spot activity on the K-dwarf component and flare-like events, whose times of occurrence did not follow the same pattern as the binary orbital phase, were observed. An O-C analysis of data acquired over the last 35 years, furthermore, revealed timing variations that could be explained by other factors, such as the presence of an undetected third body or an orbital eccentricity. The findings from the spectra reinforced the insights into the system, giving details of the K-dwarf projected rotation velocity (V_K sin i = 92 km\/s), orbital amplitude (K_K=150.5 km\/s) and H_alpha velocity amplitude, suggesting a less concentrated source of the emission around the sub-white-dwarf point on the K-star than previously observed."}
{"text":"\nIn this paper, we calculate the longitudinal impedance and wake functions for an undulator setup with a finite transverse size of the electron bunch. This calculation is compared to traditional methods which consider a line density of the electron bunch. We derive a closed expression for impedance and wake function that can be used for numerical evaluation in a general case and also for analytical solution for a Gaussian transverse and longitudinal bunch shape. Finally, we analyze the potential of current-enhanced SASE (ESASE) schemes proposed for the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) that fall into our approximations. We find that impedance-induced energy spread can drastically reduce the gain of FEL radiation, which conflicts with existing literature that considers wake calculations in free space, ignoring the presence of the undulator."}
{"text":"\nThis paper investigates the use of a particular type of numerical methods, commonly known as spectral methods, for tackling complex equations of General Relativity. A comprehensive introduction is provided for their usage, discussing in particular their fast convergence and stability. Moreover, several approaches to solving partial differential equations are discussed, including the one-dimensional case with one or multiple domains, and cases with multiple dimensions. To demonstrate the efficacy of the methods, selected applications in the field of General Relativity are presented - ranging from rapidly rotating strange stars, binary black hole initial data, supernovae core collapses, and binary black hole mergers."}
{"text":"\nBy using the 100m Green Bank Telescope and 43m telescope to observe a collection of 100 isolated spiral and irregular galaxies, this study surveys their HI emission to determine the proportion of diffuse components in their disk. Comparing the HI line flux densities obtained by the two telescopes reveals the degree to which galaxies have an extended low surface brightness HI gas that observational models do not take into account. Results show that in ~75% of the sample, current models are appropriate in accurately accounting for HI distributions. The remaining galaxies, however, could have either a significantly greater HI distribution or a more concentrated one than the models prescribe. Additionally, HI-rich companions to the target objects are found and a set of HI line flux density calibrators are established."}
{"text":"\nUsing X-ray detection methods, we have studied the twin brown dwarf 2MASS J11011926-7732383 AB (hereafter 2M1101AB) present in the Cha I star formation region. XMM-Newton and Chandra data are used to observe the influence on X-ray emission of physical parameters (mass, bolometric luminosity, and effective temperature) for this coeval pair of substellar bodies. Although the XMM-Newton resolution is not adequate to distinguish contributions from the two components of the binary, the column density of the X-ray source detected with it is analogous to the infrared extinction of component A. Also, Chandra can resolve the binary and suggests that the bulk of the X-ray emission is related to the photospherically cooler component B. These seemingly discrepant conclusions appear to be indicates of the X-ray emission's intense variability. When combined with formerly conducted sensitive X-ray surveys of low-mass members of Cha I, it can be understood that X-ray luminosity slowly declines as (sub)stellar mass decreases, as is regularly seen in star formation regions. 2M1101B, the coolest (M8.25 type) and least massive brown dwarf in Cha I thus far detected in X-rays, is also one of the youngest (~ 1 Myr) substellar members of Cha I and therefore relatively luminous. Most bona fide brown dwarfs of Cha I have remained out of reach of the sensitivity limits of available X-ray observations due to the combination of their low luminosity and higher age."}
{"text":"  This study examines the creation of entanglement in semiconductor quantum dot systems due to electron scattering. We investigate the contributions of different resonance types in the transmission spectra, along with the influence of the number of scattering channels, on the quantum correlations between the two particles. Our findings reveal that Breit-Wigner resonances have no effect on the entanglement between energy states, while Fano peaks induce two close maxima separated by a minimum if there are two channels of scattering, or a single maximum if there are multiple channels. The results demonstrate the capacity to manipulate the production and detection of entanglement through external fields by exploiting Fano resonances."}
{"text":"In the present paper, we investigate the relationship between hypersurfaces in hyperbolic space $H^{n+1}$ and conformally invariant equations. Through a hyperbolic Gauss map and the notion of hyperbolic curvature radii,we formulate the Christoffel problem. This direct connection also allows us to make a direct comparison between the scalar curvature problem posed by Nirenberg and Kazdan-Warner on the $\\mathbb{S}^n$ manifold, and provide an insight into its hypersurface interpretation. Additionally, this serves as a bridge to link the theory of hypersurfaces with prescribed hyperbolic Gauss map in $H^{n+1}$ with some important problems in conformally invariant PDEs regarding the Schouten tensor. We further analyse this relationship to prove that certain Weingarten functionals are constant only on round spheres among all compactly immersed hypersurfaces in $H^{n+1}$."}
{"text":"\nIn this study, we measure the transition matrix elements of hadronic decays of the form Upsilon(nS) to pi pi Upsilon(mS) for (n, m) = (3, 1), (2, 1), and (3, 2). The decay modes were reconstructed using decay products of mu+mu- and e+e- final states of the Upsilon, and were characterized by separate Dalitz plot distributions for each mode, which were fit both separately and jointly under the assumption of isospin symmetry. These fits revealed the previously observed anomaly in the di-pion invariant mass of the Upsilon(3S) -> pi pi Upsilon(1S) transition and suggest the presence of ignored terms in the Upsilon(2S) -> pi pi Upsilon(1S) and Upsilon(3S) -> pi pi Upsilon(2S) transitions, albeit at a lower level. The expansion of the decay rate was consistent with the conservation principles of the axial-vector current."}
{"text":"This paper examines a previously undiscovered relationship between Maxwell fields in flat space and a complex world-line in complex Minkowski space. We investigate a CR structure associated with the embedding of Penrose's real three-dimensional null infinity, I^+, as a surface in a two-complex dimensional space, C^2. This structure is thought to provide insight into the origin of both electric and magnetic dipole moments, while also giving access to previously unknown physical information contained within a complex 'decomposition' of the CR function into its real and imaginary parts."}
{"text":"This investigation presents JW 380, a newly detected binary located within the Orion Nebula Cluster. The system has a combined mass of 0.26 and 0.15 Msol and an orbital period of 5.3 days. The Monitor project was utilized for the discovery of this binary via time-resolved photometry (V and i bands) with the Isaac Newton Telescope and Wide Field Camera. Additionally, radial velocity observations from the cross-correlation functions measured the systemic velocity, which is within 1 sigma of that of the ONC. Modelling of the data showed stellar radii of 1.19 and 0.90 Rsol and gave an age estimate of 2-3 Myr. This study's findings add to the small number of pre-main-sequence eclipsing binaries with precise measurements in the literature by providing additional evidence in the mass-radius parameter space."}
{"text":"This article examines the unique mechanisms that are found in finite two-state trajectories. Additionally, it considers canonical forms of reduced dimensions to account for both symmetrical and irreversible transitions. A topological mapping of kinetic schemes into reduced dimension forms is discussed and tools for extracting the forms from finite data are presented. These canonical forms of reduced dimensions are dedicated to discriminating the different kinetic schemes and show their specified properties."}
{"text":"\nThe complementarity between quark and lepton mixing matrices allow us to make strong predictions. Through examination of a matrix composed of the quark (CKM) and lepton (PMNS) mixing matrices (V_M), we find that any theoretical model in accordance with quark data and the solar and atmospheric mixing angles, gives $\\theta_{13}^{PMNS}=(9{^{+1}_{-2}})^\\circ$, which is consistent with the current 90% CL experimental upper limit. We also determine the lepton phases and the CP-violating invariants J and S_1, as well as S_2, from the same matrix. Next, we investigate the effects of non-diagonal neutrino mass on lepton decays in SUSY theories under the Quark-Lepton complementarity and a flavor symmetry. This results in clear predictions for such decays involving muons and taus; if the Dirac neutrino Yukawa couplings are equal, then the lepton decays are related by the V_M entries, whereas if the couplings are hierarchical or the low energy neutrino masses degenerate, then the CKM hierarchy governs."}
{"text":"\n\n In this paper, we present the newest version of the MadGraph\/MadEvent Monte Carlo event generator, which has a direct web interface allowing users to generate events for arbitrary processes in the Standard Model and several theories beyond it. This update provides users with a framework for implementing their own physics models, as well as the capability to generate separate events for signals and backgrounds in the same simulation run. This also allows for analyses with inclusive multi-jet samples, combining parton-level events with parton showers. To demonstrate the new features, six applications to hadron collider physics are described, such as exploring the Higgs boson search in the pp --> H --> W^+ W^- channel and its CP properties, determining the spin of a new resonance from lepton angular distributions, and the single-top and Higgs associated production in a general 2HDM. Furthermore, a comparison of strong SUSY pair production at the SPS points is discussed, as well as the production of inclusive W+jets samples and its comparison with Tevatron data."}
{"text":"\nWe studied the density profile of the M31 globular cluster B514 via\nobservations with the HST\/ACS instrument. By combining an analysis of the\nintegrated light with star counts, we were able to follow the\nprofile of the cluster out to a distance of ~130pc. Our data indicated a King\nModel with a core radius of 0.38\" and a tidal radius of ~17\", leading us to\nassert the existence of extra-tidal stars. Moreover, the half-light radius\nof B514 was larger than would be typical for its luminosity, positioning it in\na region usually occupied by nuclei of dwarf elliptical galaxies and peculiar\nclusters such as Omega Cen and G1."}
{"text":"\nA study of non-Gaussianity in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature data of the WMAP satellite was conducted utilizing local morphological measures generated from the steerable wavelet constructed from the second Gaussian derivative. These measures, including orientation, signed-intensity, and elongation, were analyze by analyzing their associated statistically isotropic random fields across the wavelet scales from 27.5 arcminutes to 30 degrees on the celestial sphere. Results showed no detection in the orientation or elongation analysis, but a strong detection was found in the excess kurtosis of the signed-intensity of the WMAP data at a wavelet scale of around 10 degrees, with a significance level below 0.5%. Instrumental noise, foreground emissions, and large-scale modulations related to unknown systematics were determined to be unlikely sources of the observed non-Gaussianity. The detection of non-Gaussianity in the CMB implies that the current concordance cosmological model may require further revision."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate the consistency between X-ray-derived and weak-lensing-derived masses for four of the highest ranked shear-selected galaxy clusters affiliated with A781 in the Deep Lens Survey. Specifically, we compare X-ray data from Chandra and XMM-Newton and weak-lensing data from Kitt Peak Mayall 4-m Telescope by adopting a standard NFW profile for mass reconstruction. We fix the scale radius for both X-ray and weak-lensing profiles using a fitting function from cosmological hydrodynamic simulations and an X-ray mass assuming isothermality. Subsequently, we focus on the comparison of the central densities, which scale linearly with mass, for the four clusters. We find that for the majority of the clusters, the X-ray-derived and weak-lensing-derived masses are in agreement, yet a difference of two sigma is detected for one cluster possibly caused by its merger with a smaller cluster. This research can be employed to gain a better understanding of the biases that may arise when estimating mass through X-ray and weak-lensing cluster surveys, as these methods are vital for testing cosmology."}
{"text":"This study investigates the partitioning of Min proteins between daughter cells following septation in Escherichia coli by employing the 3D model developed by Huang et al. We examine the MinD and MinE oscillations with respect to septal closure to figure out the source of unequal distribution of Min proteins. Our findings suggest that at least 85% of the daughter cells experience Min oscillations following septation, and that enhanced MinD binding at the polar and dynamic septal regions does not bring about a substantial increase in the fraction of oscillating daughters. We further analyze this problem in the context of other Min models, and suggest possible biological processes which may effectively minimize partitioning errors of Min proteins."}
{"text":"\nA non-perturbative model, with an effective strong coupling constant and devoid of adjustable parameters, is used to explore the charm-quark fragmentation in e+e\u2212 annihilation. Perturbative fragmentation functions, containing NLO coefficient functions, NLL non-singlet DGLAP evolution, and NNLL large-x resummation, are employed in this model. We utilize the effective coupling constant in the NNLO approximation to investigate the hadronization effects and compare our results to experimental data from the Z0 pole and the Upsilon(4S) resonance. Generally, our model agrees well with D*+-meson spectra from ALEPH. However, discrepancies were found when compared to D and D* data from BELLE and CLEO. Even so, our model is able to reproduce the first 10 Mellin moments of the data sets within the respective uncertainty limits. Although there are visible improvements in our analysis, a comprehensive NNLO\/NNLL analysis is still necessary."}
{"text":"We present axisymmetric simulations of the magnetorotational collapse of very massive stars in full general relativity, with particular focus on supermassive stars (M>10^3M_sun) and very massive Pop III stars, whose initial configurations are characterized by n=3 polytropes. We found that the core collapses to a black hole and the remaining matter forms a torus around it. For weak fields, the torus settles down following ejection of a fraction of matter due to shock heating, while in the presence of strong fields it generates a wind, radial oscillations and MHD turbulence which can produce long-wavelength gravitational waves detectable by LISA. Our results suggest that the final state of the magnetorotational collapse invariably is a central black hole surrounded by a collimated magnetic field and an accretion torus that is a viable candidate for the central engine of a long-soft gamma-ray burst."}
{"text":"\nRecent findings demonstrate that the galaxies which host long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are highly suitable for the formation of massive stars which give rise to the GRBs. To find out how well the interstellar medium (ISM) characteristics along the line of sight of the Super Star Cluster, NGC1705-1, aligns with that of distant GRB hosts, we conducted a comparison study. We looked at the same set of metal transitions in the UV and used related ISM structures in NGC1705-1. We noted that the UV radiation field in the starburst environment is the cause of lack of molecular gas and the other ISM traits in NGC1705-1 resemble that of distant GRB hosts with high neutral gas column, low molecular gas fraction, low metallicity, alpha-element enhancement as well as low dust depletion. Furthermore, we concurred that the afterglow UV radiation from the GRB excites C^+, Si^+ and Fe^+ ions in the neutral gas clouds located at a distance of 500 pc from NGC1705-1, producing excited lines commonly observed in GRB host ISM. We concluded that a comparative assessment of star clusters and high-redshift GRB progenitors is a promising method to identify the eminent physical properties essential to the GRB\u2019s emergence."}
{"text":"The presence of structured, non-uniform connectivity has encouraged great interest in complex networks. To better identify and distinguish different types of complex networks, meaningful measurements of local network topology are needed. Here, a new set of motifs known as chains of connected nodes is proposed and studied. These chains are categorized into cords, tails, rings and handles depending on the type of their extremities and a theoretical analysis about their density in random and scale-free networks is conducted. An algorithm for identifying chains in general networks is presented, where the potential of considering such motifs is illustrated by describing five categories of real world networks. The results found indicate the existence of several chains in the real world networks such as the WWW, books and power-grid. The possibility of chains being the results of incompletely sampled networks is also discussed."}
{"text":"\nThis article investigates the structural behavior and polarization reversal of KNO$_3$, an unusual ferroelectric material, through a series of first-principles calculations. Using a two-parameter model, the energy of system is written as a low-order expansion in the polarization and the nitrate group orientation. Our findings show that this model reproduces the first-principles results very accurately and outline a parameter-space phase diagram which exhibits regions of unusual triple-well potentials. Additionally, we have also examined the changes in KNO$_3$ as a result of applied pressure, discovering a first-derivative discontinuity on the energy-versus-polarization curve at zero polarization."}
{"text":"\nIn this paper, we examine the sources of molecular line and mean opacity data utilized when modeling ultracool dwarf and extrasolar planet atmospheres. We additionally provide tables containing the Rosseland and Planck mean opacities, which can be useful for studying the atmospheres, interiors, and evolution of these celestial bodies. The molecular opacities for these models are generated from both publicly available databases, laboratory measurements, and computed values, while elemental abundances used in the mean opacity calculation are computed from a chemical equilibrium model with recently updated solar abundances. We also observe that the opacities of atomic and molecular alkali elements boost mean opacities significantly when applicable to densities of planets\u2019 and brown dwarf atmospheres and interiors. Our resulting opacity tables are publicized and their limitations discussed."}
{"text":"\nIn this article, we explore the impact of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and International Linear Collider (ILC) on cosmology when dark energy is set by a kination-dominated quintessence scenario. Our inquiry focuses on the possible detection of WIMP properties, which if found to be differing from those expected from frozen-out relic-abundance levels in a radiation-dominated universe, may indicate evidence of a quintessence model. We investigate the precision of measurements that can be achieved by the LHC and ILC together, comprising four benchmark points in accordance with the LCC scheme. We further consider that the WIMPs are the only dark matter component in these investigations. Our scrutiny reveals that the LHC and ILC can provide sufficient precision to discover kination-dominated quintessence, thus offering important alternative routes to delve into both dark matter and dark energy."}
{"text":"  We present a preliminary set of orbital and physical parameters for the binary A-component of the quadruple pre-main sequence system V773 Tau. Utilizing interferometric and radial velocity measurements, we derived a 66.0$\\pm$2.4 deg inclination and corresponding dynamical masses of 1.54$\\pm$0.14M$_{\\sun}$ and 1.332$\\pm$0.097M$_{\\sun}$, respectively, for the primary (Aa) and secondary (Ab) components. We find that the individual temperatures and luminosities of each component are largely consistent with those reported in other studies, and with the derived masses we may compare the properties of V773 Tau A with solar-composition models of intermediate-mass pre-main sequence stars, which largely agree with our findings."}
{"text":"\nIn this article, we consider a polynomial Poisson bivector $\\alpha$ on a finite-dimensional vector space $V$ over $\\mathbb{C}$. We present a construction of an algebra with the PBW (Poincar\\'{e}-Bihkoff-Witt) property from $\\alpha$ that is defined by generators and relations. Namely, we show how to construct a quotient of the free tensor algebra $T(V^*)$ given by relations $x_i\\otimes x_j-x_j\\otimes x_i=R_{ij}(\\hbar)$, where $R_{ij}(\\hbar)\\in T(V^*) \\otimes \\hbar \\mathbb{C}[[\\hbar]]$ and $R_{ij} = \\hbar \\Sym(\\alpha_{ij})+ \\mathcal{O} (\\hbar^2)$. Here, there is one relation for each pair $i,j=1...\\dim V$. Additionally, we prove that this defined algebra obeys the PBW property, which is an extension of the Poincar\\'{e}-Birkhoff-Witt theorem. Further, the case of a linear Poisson structure gives the PBW theorem itself, and a quadratic Poisson structure gives an object closely related to a quantum $R$-matrix on $V$. In the same light, we obtain a free resolution of the deformed algebra (for an arbitrary $\\alpha$). \nWhile the construction of the PBW algebra is simple and the proof of the PBW property is straightforward, more effort is needed to prove the conjecture that in this way we can obtain an isomorphic algebra to the Kontsevich star-algebra."}
{"text":"In this article, we propose a reliable, empirical procedure for analysing the effects of preferred frame effects (PFEs) on binary pulsars with relatively high rates of periastron advance. We demonstrate that this novel PFE timing model generates a recognizable, singular feature in the available data which securely confirms its presence. We further expand this version of the Damour-Deruelle timing equation to include this marked as a determining factor in estimating or constraining the variability of Lorentz invariance of gravity in neutron stars. We then apply this new approach to the Double Pulsar system, demonstrating that our method currently limits the effects of PFEs on this system\u2019s orbital precession rate, d omega\/dt, but with the potential to gather more data over the upcoming years to measure all new PFE timing parameters. Lastly, we explore the feasibility of several systems combining as a PFE \u2018antenna array\u2019 with SKA, with the ability to detect any violations of Lorentz invariance of gravity and determine its source should it exist."}
{"text":"\nIn this article, the effects of increased numbers of phosphorylation sites on a biological response are studied by means of a self-consistent integral equation method combined with Monte Carlo simulations. The potential influence of rebinding in cell signaling is explored, and the behaviour of what would be an allovalent system is discussed. Results point to re-binding having a non-linear effect on the dose response and the model suggests that it on its own is not enough to create a highly cooperative behaviour - further investigations are needed."}
{"text":"This paper offers an analysis of the Galois theory of iterated endomorphisms of an abelian algebraic group $A$ over a global field $F$. We consider the inverse images of an element $\\alpha \\in A(F)$ under some iterate of the $\\ell$-th power $[\\ell]$ and analyze the associated Galois group of extensions, which depend on the endomorphism ring and Weil pairing. For certain cases of $A$, we determine when the Galois group is as large as possible, and then use this to compute the density of primes $\\p$ in the ring of $F$ such that the order of $(\\alpha \\bmod{\\p})$ is prime to $\\ell$. As an example, if $A\/F$ is an elliptic curve with surjective 2-adic representation and $\\alpha \\in A(F)$ not in $2A(F(A[4]))$, then we prove that the density of $\\mathfrak{p}$ satisfying the given condition is 11\/21."}
{"text":"\nTo explore further some of the yet undiscovered aspects of the Sun's photospheric magnetism, it is attractive to use a combination of ultra-high spatial resolution and linear polarization measurements. Here, we present theoretical predictions for the Sr I 4607 \\AA line based on calculations of the line scattering polarization in a three-dimensional (3D) medium, with anisotropic radiation, the Hanle effect of a tangled magnetic field and the horizontal inhomogeneities created by the solar convection. Our results show that the solar disk center, which is a difficult case for the forward scattering, has a significant amount of linear polarization in the emergent spectral line radiation, and that the small-scale patterns in the linear polarization signals depend on the adopted magnetic field model. It is suggested that with the help of a 1-m telescope with adaptive optics and a suitable polarimeter, this type of scattering polarization measurement can be made at the diffraction limit resolution."}
{"text":"\nThis paper deals with the solution of the self-consistent equation for the energy gap\nparameter $\\Delta_{\\bf k}$ in the BCS theory of superconductivity. Our study suggests\nthat there exists a firm association between the energy gap value $\\Delta$ received\nwith the aid of the cut-off approximation and the magnitude of the energy gap\nparameter $|\\Delta_{\\bf k}|$ as given by any arbitrary interaction $V_{{\\bf k},{\\bf\nk}'}$.\nThis correspondence implies that $\\Delta$ can be seen as a weighted mean of the\n$|\\Delta_{\\bf k}|$ in the electronic states within a certain cut-off energy\n$\\xi_c$ around the Fermi surface.

{"text":"\nIn this paper, we build on a local approximation approach to develop a microscopic theory to examine superconductivity in a magnetic field. We derive an expression for the free energy density as a function of temperature and vector potential, as well as two main equations of the theory. The first equation is an implicit solution for the wave vector's energy gap parameter in relation to the temperature and vector potential. The second equation is a London-like equation that links the electrical current density and vector potential with an effective superconducting electron density that is dependent on temperature and vector potential. These two equations enable us to assess spatial variants of vector potentials and energy gap parameters for provided temperature, applied magnetic field and sample geometry. The theory exposes the probability of a 'partly-paired state' being formed under specific surroundings, in which paired and de-paired electrons are together. Even when temperature is zero, a non-negligible Knight shift is nonetheless present past a specific threshold. We believe the theory to be accurate for highly localized superconductors under all temperatures and magnetic fields towards the superconducting transition. In the low-field limit, the theory can be tightened down to the BCS local-limit result. We apply the theory to two samples - a semi-infinite superconductor in a magnetic field in line with its surface, and an isolated vortex in a non-ending superconductor - to summarize the spatial variants of electric potentials and energy gap parameters. In conclusion, we calculate\u2026"}
{"text":"\nIn this article, we investigate if the information from two methods of constraining dark energy - weak lensing tomography and cluster counting - can be used in tandem to refine mass calibration of clusters. We analyze a survey similar to the Dark Energy Survey (DES) to determine if it is possible to combine cosmic shearing of high redshift source galaxies with halo clustering at lower redshifts without degrading cosmological constraints. Surprisingly, our findings show that when weak lensing and halo clustering are treated independently, the combined dark energy constraints are even slightly better than the sum of individual constraints. Our results echo those proposed by Takada and Bridle examining correlations between cosmic shear and cluster counts."}
{"text":"\nAn analysis of relevant cosmological data has been conducted in order to identify any distinct features of f(R) acceleration models that may hint at their presence in the universe. This includes the WMAP cosmic microwave background power spectrum, SNLS supernovae distance measures, SDSS luminous red galaxy power spectrum, and galaxy-CMB angular correlation. While there is a expected distinct signature in the linear matter power spectrum, due to theoretical uncertainties, weak constraints could be derived from the galaxy power spectrum. The tightest restrictions arise from examination of modification to the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect due to the presence of gravitational potentials during the acceleration phase, which leads to the discovery that the Compton wavelength of the field must be less than the Hubble scale."}
{"text":"\nWe analyze the feasibility of carrying out experiments aiming to study parity violation in atomic hydrogen and deuterium. We evaluate the potential for these experiments to improve our understanding of interactions in theElectroweak framework of the Standard Model. We conclude that experiments with hydrogen and deuterium should be pursued since these entail minimal atomic physics uncertainty and can lead to highly precise measurements of the sin^2 theta_W at low momentum transfer. Additionally, the tests could shed light on three electron-nucleon weak neutral current coupling constants, C_{1p}, C_{2p},and C_{2D}, which have not been accurately established. In order to effectively accomplish these measurements, we propose the use of a slow (77K) metastable beam of deuterium combined with new ultraviolet radiation technology provided by Free Electron Lasers. A combined physics+experiment error of 0.3% would be necessary to measure the nuclear spin independent coupling C_{1D} to the desired level of precision."}
{"text":"\nThe study of human heart rate has uncovered a complexity of fluctuation patterns. Previously, multifractality had been observed in heart rate fluctuations of healthy individuals [Ivanov et al., Nature {\\bf 399}, 461 (1999)]. Additionally, recent works have highlighted the presence of scale invariance in heart rate fluctuations, as seen in detrended analyses of healthy subjects [Kiyono et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. {\\bf 93}, 178103 (2004)]. This paper provides clarification of this paradox by demonstrating that the scale invariance is present in the probability density functions (PDFs) of summed detrended heart rate intervals, and not in that of detrended heart rate increments. Our findings moreover uncover a general feature of human heartbeat dynamics, to be shared by healthy and pathological states alike."}
{"text":"By utilising the concepts of Grothendieck's derivators, a 'universal localizing invariant' and a 'universal additive invariant' are created. Both invariants take a dg (Differential Graded) category as an input, U_l and U_a, and put out a mapped space whose target is a strong triangulated invariant M^loc and M^add respectively. U_l satisfies all three properties and U_a the first two. It is proven that Waldhausen K-theory appears as a mapping space to U_a, while higher Chern characters link K-theory to cyclic homology. This is the first time that a conceptual characterization of Quillen-Waldhausen's K-theory has been established since its founding in the 70s."}
{"text":"\nThis study examines the thermal widths of quarkonia prior to their dissociation into open heavy quark pairs. The thermal widths were derived from a quantum chromodynamics (QCD) calculation of the quarkonium dissociation cross section up to next-to-leading order, the quarkonium wave function in a temperature-dependent potential sourced from lattice QCD, and a thermal distribution of partons with thermal masses. The resulting thermal widths, greater than 100 to 250 MeV at 1.4Tc, correspond to an effective dissociation cross section of between 1.5 to 3.5 mb via gluons and 1 to 2 mb via quarks. Despite this, considerably smaller thermal widths and effective cross sections were obtained for the upsilon at equivalent temperatures."}
{"text":"\nThis paper explores the idea that a difference in membrane pore geometry can lead to an asymmetric diffusion of particles. We present both a model and an experiment to demonstrate the concept. The model consists of a two-dimensional gas of disk-shaped particles of two sizes, while the experiment involves the diffusion of various sizes of glass beads through a metal membrane. Our results indicate that the asymmetric pores of the membrane create an uneven diffusion rate of the smaller particles. Furthermore, when large particles are present, their passage can impede the flow of small particles in one direction but allow the small particles to pass freely in the other. This geometry-specific diffusion process may be relevant in certain biological systems, such as membrane ion channels."}
{"text":"\nWe examine the issue of how radiative corrections at low energy scales may cause breaking of symmetries, such as the quark-lepton complementarity (QLC) and the tri-bimaximal mixing (TBM), that are proposed to explain the observed mixing pattern of neutrinos. Our investigation is conducted within the context of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) for nonhierarchical neutrinos. We find that the appropriate choice of extra phases $\\alpha_{2,3}$ can retain the high scale mixing patterns which would otherwise be spoiled by the radiative corrections. Further, measuring the angle $\\theta_{13}$ at a future point in time may enable distinction between the different symmetry-based models even after the radiative breaking of the symmetries."}
{"text":"\nUsing photothermal heterodyne detection, we are able to record absorption spectra and images of individual single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs). This method can detect nanotubes of both metallic and semiconducting species, as it is dependent solely on light absorption. By studying SWNTs, we have identified the first and second optical transitions in individual semiconducting nanotubes. Comparison between the emission and absorption spectra shows that the transitions have small Stokes shifts. Near-infrared absorption spectra also features sidebands, which are attributed to exciton-phonon bound states, while such sidebands are not evident in metallic nanotubes."}
{"text":"\nIn this paper, we present an efficient heuristic algorithm, Qcut, for detecting the community structures of complex networks using modularity (Q) optimization. Through tests with both synthetic and real networks, we demonstrate that Qcut has stronger scalability and finds higher modularities than the existing approaches. Further, we introduce a recursive algorithm, HQcut, using Qcut as a base, to overcome the resolution limitproblem. With HQcut, communities can be detected at a finer scale with higher accuracy compared to other methods. Finally, we apply Qcut and HQcut to explore a protein-protein interaction network, which leads to interesting biological results that could have been missed by the existing algorithms."}
{"text":"\nThis paper examines the effects of rotation on the thermal features of random classical zero-point radiation. Through the investigation of a rotating reference system, two-point correlation functions and energy density, it is found that the Planck's factor appears at a temperature of T= hw\/k for the periodic correlation functions. Additionally, the detector shows radiation typical of an inertial detector in a thermal bath with a Plank's spectrum at the temperature T, but masked by a factor of 2\/3(4\u03b32-1) for electromagnetic fields and 2\/9(4\u03b32-1) for massless scalar fields. This rotation effect is due to having two parameters (angular velocity w and radius of rotation) versus one parameter of acceleration in uniformly accelerated linear motion. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this effect has not yet been reported in quantum theory."}
{"text":"\nThis paper presents the initial findings of two surveys exploring the presence of blazars in space, based on data collected from both microwave signals and combined X-ray\/radio radiation. The first survey used a 41 GHz flux-limited selection of 200 blazars and radio galaxies from the WMAP 3-yr catalog. This sample is expected to be detectable by the upcoming GLAST mission. The second survey relied on radio sources located near serendipitous X-ray detections from Swift GRBs. This sample is particularly interesting because it is: unbiased due to explosions in space, very deep in X-ray radiation, covers an area of 20-30 square degrees, contains all blazars with 1.4 GHz flux greater than 10 mJy, and has the capacity to estimate the existence of GLAST's gamma-ray background and its accompanying spectrum."}
{"text":"This article examines the presence of waves localized in the interface of two different cubic nonlinear periodic media. We have given them the name 'surface gap solitons' (SGS). Using formal analysis, we investigate the emergence of these SGS's via bifurcation of standard gap solitons. Moreover, to find the largest coefficient jump which allows for the SGS existence, numerical solutions are established. We note that the largest jump is witnessed near transition points of gap solitons. We create a homotopy method of continuation of SGS families, together with the analysis of SGS in the photonic band gaps by employing a continuous potential with a differential jump at the interface. In the end, we explain why SGS's are limited to the interior points of band gap by bifurcations of linear bound states."}
{"text":"\nThis research examines the hidden variables that are necessary for predicting measurable properties of various networks, using a general analytical result for the propagator. Applying this method to protein-protein interaction networks (PINs) reveals the degree distributions and clustering coefficients for several different species. Using data gathered from different sources, a good agreement between the calculated results and measured information is found. Furthermore, the study of the human interactome suggests that degree distributions alone are not sufficient to determine the properties of PINs, as two different parameter sets produce the same degree distributions yet different clustering coefficients."}
{"text":"\nWe investigate the various ordering transitions in block copolymer melts held in narrow capillaries. To determine the variety of ordered morphologies, we employ a phenomenological Landau weak crystallization theory of cylindrical geometry, based on the theory of order parameters and the eigenfunctions of the Laplace operator. Our results show the impact of boundary conditions and specific cylinder radius-wave length ratio on the symmetry of the resulting morphologies, and the emergence of helical structures. Furthermore, our research explores the order-disorder transitions (ODT) and the order-order transitions (OOT) involving some of the simplest morphologies. Additionally, these findings also relate to ordering systems such as charge-density waves in a critical region, microemulsions and weakly charged polyelectrolytes in a poor solvent."}
{"text":"\nWe explore the impact of S parameter sign on holographic technicolor scenarios with fermions localized near the ultraviolet brane. A negative S parameter can significantly reduce the constraints on these models by allowing for lower masses of new particles that can be more easily detected at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). To demonstrate this, we extend a prior demonstration that S parameter for electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) boundary conditions in generic metrics is greater than zero to include the effects of general gauge field kinetic functions. Additionally, we analyze the implications of EWSB in the bulk with a non-zero Higgs field value, revealing that S is consistently positive and of the order of one. Finally, we demonstrate the validity of these results in an anti-de Sitter five-dimensional model with a power law Higgs profile, including possible kinetic mixings from higher-order operators in the 5D theory. In sum, our study suggests that S parameter is demonstrably positive in extra dimensional calculable models."}
{"text":"This article looks at the intervals of Catalan's lattices (which are the Stanley lattice, Tamari lattice, and Kreweras lattice) and their relation to realizers of triangulations. Specifically, a bijection $\\Phi$ between pairs of non-crossing Dyck paths and realizers of triangulations is defined and its restriction to Tamari's and Kreweras' intervals is discussed. It is demonstrated that $\\Phi$ induces a bijection between Tamari intervals and minimal realizers, which in turn gives a bijection between Tamari intervals and triangulations. Furthermore, it is shown that $\\Phi$ induces a bijection between Kreweras intervals and the (unique) realizers of stack triangulations, which correspond to ternary trees."}
{"text":"\nThis article evaluates the consistency between the renormalization group (RG) running of the chiral operator and the counting rule in nuclear chiral perturbation theory (ChPT). Using the Wilsonian RG (WRG) equation, we examine the running of an example s-wave pion production operator for NN\\to d pi. We demonstrate that as long as the initial operator has no chiral-symmetry-violating interaction, the WRG running will not generate any. In addition, an analytic expression of the counter terms generated due to the infinitesimal cutoff reduction is provided. Further, we discuss the range of the cutoff variation for which the running of the counter terms is of natural size. Finally, our findings are verified with numerical results."}
{"text":"\nIn this article, we present distributed algorithms to efficiently manage the allocation of spectrum, power control, routing, and congestion in multi-hop wireless networks. We develop a scheme to segment the spectrum into multiple subdivisions which can ensure that the transmitters and receivers can happily function without conflicting one another. Furthermore, a distributed and asynchronous algorithm is presented to analyze the spectrum utilization. Given this outcome, the algorithms also tackle the optimization of transmission power, traffic routes, and user input rates. If certain conditions are satisfied, the algorithms are suggested to converge to a desired optimal point."}
{"text":"We report the detection of a high-amplitude kilohertz quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) from the ulta-compact low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) 1A 1246-588. This QPO was detected when the source was in a soft, high-flux state and had a peak frequency of 1258+-2 Hz and a single trial significance of more than 7 sigma. The coherence and amplitude of this QPO is also higher than has been seen in any other source, suggesting that this is the upper QPO of a kilohertz pair. We estimate that the persistent flux of 1A 1246-588 is ~0.2-0.3 percent of the Eddington flux, making it one of the weakest LMXBs in which a kilohertz QPO has been detected. The root-mean-square (rms) amplitude is extremely high at 27+-3 percent. The colour-colour diagram of the source provides further evidence for its atoll nature."}
{"text":"This paper presents the results of an observational campaign to identify and spectroscopically characterize the 150-member sample of high-energy X-ray dominated BL Lacertae objects (HBLs) contained in the multi-frequency Sedentary Survey. Using a combination of ESO 3.6m, KPNO 4m, and Telescopio Nazionale Galileo (TNG) optical telescopes, 76 sources were identified and spectra obtained, 50 of which were newly determined to be BL Lac objects, 18 of which were already classified as BL Lacs for which no redshift measurement was available, and 8 being broad emission-line AGNs. A 90% efficiency was calculated for this selection technique. Positional and spectroscopic information for all BL Lacs in the sample are provided, as well as the redshift distributions when compared to other BL Lac samples. Lower limits to the redshift are calculated for 26 sources lacking recognizable absorption features, and a correlation between optical spectral slope, 1.4GHz radio luminosity, and Ca H&K break is found for the 38 sources with high-quality spectra, indicating that in powerful and beamed sources, the optical light is mostly from non-thermal emission from the jet."}
{"text":"\nA Suzaku observation of Centaurus A, a radio-loud active galaxy, in 2005 provided a broadband spectrum covering 0.3 to 250 keV. Results from the X-ray Imaging Spectrometer and Hard X-ray Detector showed that the hard X-rays were explained by two absorbed power-laws, while the soft X-rays were fitted to a two-temperature model with a third power-law component to account for various sources of emission. Narrow fluorescence emission lines, Fe, Si, S, Ar, Ca and Ni absorption edges, and elemental abundance estimation all suggested a high metallicity of the circumnuclear material and supernova enrichment. The measured Fe K alpha line width allowed the distance from the black hole to the line-emitting gas to be constrained, with a limit of 200 light-days."}
{"text":"\nIn this article, significant alignment and signed-intensity anomalies of local cosmic microwave background (CMB) features have been detected in the three-year WMAP data using a decomposition of the signal with steerable wavelets on the sphere. Specifically, the alignment analysis revealed two mean preferred planes in the sky, the first with normal axes close to the CMB dipole axis and the second with axes anomalously avoided by local CMB features. The signed-intensity analysis identified three mean preferred directions in the southern galactic hemisphere with anomalously high or low temperature of local CMB features. Both anomalies were observed at wavelet scales corresponding to angular sizes around 10 degrees on the celestial sphere and with global significance levels around 1%, however the alignment and signed-intensity anomalies were only very partially related. Instrumental noise, foreground emissions, and other potential systematics have been strongly rejected as possible origins of the detection. An explanation of the anomalies could lie in a global violation of the isotropy of the Universe, in turn inducing an intrinsic statistical anisotropy of the CMB."}
{"text":" We have conducted an extensive spectral analysis of the comets surveyed by the Chandra X-ray Observatory's ACIS spectrometer, which observed 8 different comets in the 300-1000 eV range. We applied an advanced version of our charge exchange emission model to uncover the impact of cometary, observational, and solar wind characteristics on cometary X-ray emission. It became evident that X-ray spectra mainly indicate the local solar wind conditions. We established four different spectral classes, namely (I) fast, cold wind, (II) slow, warm wind, (III) disturbed, fast, hot winds associated with interplanetary coronal mass ejections, and (IV) cool, fast high latitude wind. This insight is essential for future investigations into cometary activity."}
{"text":"\nThis paper reviews the theory surrounding the motion of dislocations within the periodic potential relief of a crystal lattice, known as the Peierls-Nabarro barriers. Based on the kink mechanism, a description is provided of the invariable temperature dependent flow stress experienced in certain types of materials. The theory of quantum mechanical dislocation tunnelling is expanded on and compared with experimental data exploring the plasticity of alkali halides, BCC and HCP metals at low temperatures. Furthermore, the behaviour of the flow stress between points of athermic anomalies is modelled by switching the mechanism of dislocation movement from one that is thermally activated and jumps over barriers, to tunnelling through them via quantum mechanics. Previous calculations are adjusted in order to make them more applicable in usage, with a specific focus on the perceptible impact on metal flow stress when switching between the normal and superconducting states due to changes in the dissipative properties of the electron subsystem, affecting the dislocation motion."}
{"text":"\nWe present the the first results of the AAT-AAOmega LRG Pilot observing run to assess the viability of a massive spectroscopic survey with AAOmega. We analyze up to 600 Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs) to z>=0.5 in three fields, including COSMOS and COMBO-17 S11. We investigate how exposure times ranging from 1 - 4 hours impact the potential of AAOmega for an essentially complete redshift survey in relatively mild conditions. We ascertain that 1.5 hours of exposure are viable for LRG redshifts up to i<20.5 and further show that the riz selection and 3-4 times heightened AAOmega throughput can drive the mean redshift from z=0.55 (2SLAQ) to z=0.681+\/- 0.005 for the riz-selected LRGs. The expanded range is significant in amplifying the signal-to-noise ratio for the detection of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs). Moreover, we discover that the LRG clustering strength matches the figures as seen in the 2SLAQ LRG Survey, obtained from both projected and semi-projected correlation functions. We believe that with AAOmega, a survey of 360,000 LRGs over 3,000 deg^2 with an efficient volume four times bigger than before can be feasible in 170 nights."}
