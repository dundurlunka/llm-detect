{"text":"The present work is devoted to the study of quantum mechanics in polymer chains, which are modeled as one-dimensional systems with nearest-neighbor interactions between particles.  We consider two different models for such systems:  The first model describes an ensemble of interacting fermions on a chain; it can be viewed as a generalization of the Hubbard model (which corresponds to spinless fermions) to include spin-dependent hopping amplitudes and repulsive interaction terms.  In this case we show that there exists a critical value U_c of the interaction strength above which the ground state energy per particle becomes negative.  This result implies that the ground state of the system undergoes a phase transition at U = U_c from a metallic-like phase into an insulating phase.   The second model considered here consists of bosons moving along a ring subject to periodic boundary conditions.  Here we prove rigorously that the ground-state energy per particle converges to zero when the number N of particles tends to infinity.  Moreover, we provide upper bounds on the rate of convergence towards the limit.  These results imply that the ground state of our system exhibits superfluid behavior."}
{"text":"We present the results of our analysis of the infrared properties (3.6-24 microns) of young stellar objects in the nearby star forming region Serpens South using data obtained with the Infrared Array Camera (IRAC; Fazio et al., 2004 ) on board the Spitzer Space Telescope . We have identified a total of 1,082 candidate young stars based upon their mid-infrared colors and luminosities , including 759 previously known members of this cluster . Of these newly discovered sources , we find that only about half are associated with outflows as traced by shocked H 2 emission or radio continuum emission .\nThe majority of the remaining new candidates appear to be deeply embedded protostars which lack significant amounts of circumstellar material . These findings suggest that many of the new candidates may represent an earlier evolutionary stage than those already known within this cloud complex . This is consistent with previous studies suggesting that there exists a large population of low-mass pre-main sequence stars in Serpens South which remain undiscovered due to their youthful ages and\/or relatively high levels of extinction ."}

{"text":"We present new numerical methods for stochastic differential equations (SDEs) on Lie groups, which are based on the concept of stochastic flows and their associated Lie brackets.  The proposed schemes preserve the geometric structure of SDEs in that they conserve the invariant measure and have an exact representation as Stratonovich integrals with respect to Brownian motion. We prove strong convergence rates under suitable conditions. Finally we illustrate our results by several examples including nonlinear filtering problems. Stochastic differential equations (SDEs), especially those arising from applications such as mathematical finance or statistical physics, often involve state variables taking values in some Lie group G. In this case it is natural to consider solutions in terms of left-invariant vector fields on G. However, standard numerical integration techniques do not take into account the underlying geometry of these systems and may lead to poor accuracy when applied directly. This motivates us to develop novel numerical methods for SDEs on Lie groups which incorporate the geometric information inherent in the problem."}
{"text":"The Solar Chromosphere is an important component in our understanding of how the Sun works and its influence on Earth, but it has been difficult to study because of its tenuous nature.  ALMA (Atacama Large Millimeter\/submillimeter Array) will be able to observe this region for the first time with unprecedented spatial resolution.   This talk will discuss some of the science that can be done using ALMA observations of the Solar Chromosphere. The Solar Chromosphere is one of the most enigmatic regions of the Sun. It lies between the photosphere and corona, and plays a crucial role in energy transport into the upper atmosphere. However, due to its extremely low density, direct observation of the chromosphere was not possible until recently when high-resolution images were obtained by space-based telescopes such as Hinode\/SOT and SDO\/AIA. In addition, ground-based observatories have also made significant progress towards studying the chromosphere through various techniques including spectropolarimetry, imaging spectroscopy, and speckle interferometry. Despite these advances, there are still many open questions about the physical processes occurring within the chromosphere which need to be addressed. For example, what causes the formation of dynamic structures like sunspots? How do magnetic fields affect plasma dynamics in the chromosphere? What is the relationship between chromospheric heating mechanisms and coronal mass ejections? These questions cannot be answered without detailed knowledge of the structure and dynamics of the chromosphere. To address them we require new observational data at higher spatial resolutions than ever before."}

The proposed search is complementary to other searches performed using solar, reactor and accelerator neutrinos.  We show that this method can be used to probe cross sections down to 10^(-41) cm^2\/GeV for neutral current elastic scattering off nuclei induced by light dark matter candidates like Majorana neutrinos and Kaluza-Klein gravitons.

{"text":"We consider a model for an enzymatic reaction network with multiple futile cycles, where each enzyme is assumed to be present at constant concentration and all reactions are reversible. We show that there exists only one positive equilibrium point if the total amount of enzymes is sufficiently large compared to the total amount of substrate molecules. This result can also be applied to other models such as those describing metabolic networks or gene regulatory systems. The proof relies on the fact that the system has a unique globally asymptotically stable equilibrium point when it is considered under mass action kinetics. In addition we prove that this equilibrium point is locally exponentially stable even though the system does not satisfy the classical Lipschitz condition. Finally, numerical simulations illustrate our results. Keywords: Enzymatic reaction networks; Mass action; Steady state analysis; Metabolic networks; Gene regulatory systems. 1 Introduction Reaction networks have been widely used to describe biochemical processes occurring inside living cells (see e.g., [1] , [4] ). These networks consist of chemical species which interact through chemical reactions. A mathematical description of these interactions leads to a set of ordinary differential equations known as the kinetic equations. For example, the Michaelis-Menten mechanism describes how an enzyme E binds reversibly to its substrate S to form a complex C before releasing product P . It consists of three elementary reactions given by \nwhere k + i and k \u2212 i denote respectively the forward and backward rate constants associated with the ith reaction. If the concentrations of the reactants and products involved in the above scheme are denoted by [S] , [E] , [P ] and [C] then the corresponding kinetic equations read dS dt = k 2 [E][S] \u2212 k \u22121 [S],\ndE dt = k 3 [E][P ] \u2212 k \u22122 [E],\n\ndC dt = k 4 [C][P ] \u2212 k \u22123 [C].\n\nThe parameters k i represent the rates of the different reactions. Note that the first two equations correspond to the formation of complexes while the last equation corresponds to their dissociation into free substrates and products."}
{"text":"The Discrete Dipole Approximation (DDA) is used to simulate light scattering by large spherical particles in this study. The DDA was first developed as an efficient method for calculating the interaction between electromagnetic waves and small particles, but it has been extended recently to calculate the interactions with large particles. In order to validate our numerical results obtained using the DDA code, we compare them against those calculated using Mie theory. We find that both methods agree well when the size parameter x = 2\u03c0a\/\u03bb < 100 where \u03bb is the incident wavelength and a is the radius of the particle. However, there are some discrepancies observed at higher values of x due to the fact that the DDA assumes that the scatterers have sharp boundaries while the actual particles do not. Finally, we show how the angular distribution of scattered intensity changes as the size of the particle increases. This work will be useful for studying aerosol optical properties such as extinction efficiency and single-scattering albedo."}
{"text":"We study the scalar radius of the pion, r_s = <F_0(0)\/F_0(m\\pi)>-1\/2, where F_0 is the pion electromagnetic form factor at zero momentum transfer.  We show that this quantity can be extracted from lattice QCD data for the pion mass dependence of the vector current-current correlator using chiral perturbation theory (ChPT).  The result agrees with experiment within errors.  In addition we find that the value of r_s obtained by fitting to ChPT depends on how many terms are included in the fit function.  This suggests that higher order corrections may not be negligible even when one considers only low energy quantities such as the pion decay constant or its charge radius.   Finally we discuss possible implications of our results for the determination of the quark condensate from lattice QCD calculations. PACS numbers: 11.15.Ha, 12.38.Gc"}

The proposed scheme is shown to be able to reproduce the correct equilibrium distribution and recover the second law of thermodynamics for both single-phase flows with constant density and temperature, as well as multiphase flows with phase change. We also demonstrate that our new LB model can accurately capture shock waves without spurious oscillations or numerical instabilities. \n \n Keywords: Nonequilibrium entropy, Lattice Boltzmann Method, Entropy limiter, Second Law of Thermodynamics, Shock wave. 1 Introduction \n \n In recent years, there has been growing interest in developing computational fluid dynamics methods based on kinetic theory [1\u20133] . Compared with conventional Navier-Stokes solvers, these approaches are more accurate at capturing complex flow phenomena such as shocks [4] , turbulence [5] , and interfacial flows [6] . Among them, the lattice Boltzmann method [7, 8] has attracted much attention due to its simplicity and efficiency [9] . \n \n However, it should be noted that most existing LB models do not satisfy the second law of thermodynamic [10] . This problem becomes particularly severe when dealing with high Mach number flows [11] . To overcome this difficulty, several attempts have been made recently [12\u201318] . For example, Chen et al. [12] introduced a modified BGK-type collision term which recovers the correct equilibrium state while satisfying the second law of thermodynamical. Similarly, Yu et al. [13] developed another type of entropy-consistent LB schemes using the concept of entropic moments. More recently, Shan et al. [14] presented a novel LB model where the relaxation time was determined according to the local Knudsen number. Although these works provide promising results, they all require additional information about the macroscopic variables, e.g., pressure and velocity fields. As a result, their applications may be limited to simple cases involving only one component gas. \n \n In contrast, we propose here a general framework for constructing entropy-consistent LB models.

{"text":"The present work is devoted to the study of astrophysical plasma turbulence, with particular emphasis on its statistical properties at different scales. We consider both kinetic and fluid descriptions for the dynamics of collisionless plasmas, which are relevant for many space and laboratory applications. In this context we investigate the nonlinear evolution of magnetic fluctuations by means of direct numerical simulations (DNS) of the Vlasov-Maxwell system. The main results can be summarized as follows:  1. Turbulence statistics -We perform DNSs of the Vlasov-Poisson system in order to characterize the statistical properties of the electrostatic potential fluctuations generated by an initial spectrum of Alfvenic modes. Our analysis shows that the energy cascade proceeds towards smaller spatial scales until it reaches the ion Larmor radius scale where it is transferred into perpendicular wavenumbers through Landau damping. At these small scales, the energy transfer rate decreases due to the reduction of phase correlations between wavevectors. This process leads to the formation of intermittency in the distribution function of particles.  2. Kinetic effects -In addition to the above mentioned features observed in the case of purely hydrodynamic turbulence, our results show that kinetic effects play also an important role in determining the statistical properties of the fluctuating fields. Indeed, we find that the presence of ions modifies significantly the shape of the probability density functions (PDFs), leading to non-Gaussian distributions characterized by tails extending over several orders of magnitude. Moreover, we observe that the PDFs become more skewed when increasing the value of the ion-to-electron mass ratio. Finally, we discuss how the inclusion of kinetic effects affects the scaling laws characterizing the power spectra of the fluctuating fields. \n3.

{"text":"We study the evolution of solitary waves and undulations on a gradually sloping beach by solving numerically the fully nonlinear Boussinesq equations for water wave motion, including both surface tension effects and bottom friction. The numerical results show that the amplitude of the leading soliton decreases as it propagates along the beach due to energy dissipation caused by bottom friction; meanwhile, its speed increases slightly because of the decrease in depth. As a result, the trailing part of the soliton becomes steeper than the front part. When the leading soliton reaches the shoreline, it breaks into several smaller solitons which then propagate further up the beach. In addition, we find that the breaking point is determined mainly by the initial amplitude of the soliton rather than by the initial phase difference between the two components of the soliton. Finally, we present some experimental data obtained at the University of Hawaii's Waimea Bay Laboratory showing good agreement with our theoretical predictions."}
{"text":"The problem of locating the source(s) of an acoustic emission (AE) event is addressed in this work by using a novel approach based on sparse representation and compressive sensing theory. The proposed method consists of two steps: first, AE signals are decomposed into several components via sparse coding; secondly, these components are used to estimate the locations of multiple AE events with high accuracy. In order to demonstrate its effectiveness, we apply our algorithm to simulated data as well as experimental results obtained from laboratory experiments. We show that the proposed method can locate multiple AE events accurately even when they occur at close time intervals or have similar waveforms. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled \"Compressive Sensing for Industrial Applications\" guest edited by Prof. Jianfeng Wu. \nIntroduction\n\nAcoustic emission (AE)\nis defined as elastic waves generated within materials due to sudden localised releases of energy [1] . It has been widely applied in non-destructive testing [2] , structural health monitoring [3] , geophysical exploration [4] , etc., where it provides useful information about material damage [5] .\nIn many practical applications such as industrial processes [6] , underground mining [7] , oil\/gas pipeline inspection [8] , and so forth, there may be more than one AE source occurring simultaneously [9] . Therefore, accurate localisation of all AE sources becomes important [10] . However, simultaneous AE sources often generate overlapping waveforms; thus conventional methods cannot distinguish them effectively [11] . To address this issue, some researchers have attempted to use advanced signal processing techniques [12] - [14] . For example, Liu et al. [15] developed a new method called 'time-frequency analysis' which was able to separate different AE sources successfully. Nevertheless, their method requires prior knowledge of the number of AE sources present in each measurement channel. Moreover, it also relies heavily on user experience to select appropriate parameters [16] ."}

{"text":"We have performed first-principles calculations to investigate the potassium intercalation into graphite using the vdW-DF method with optB86b functional and found that K atoms preferentially occupy the hollow sites between two neighboring carbon layers, which is consistent with previous experimental results.  The calculated binding energy for one K atom on top site (0.25 eV) is much smaller than those at bridge or hollow sites (1.27-1.33 eV). We also find that the charge transfer from K to C layer is negligible when K occupies the hollow sites. In addition, we show that the electronic structure near Fermi level can be tuned by changing the number of K atoms inserted into the system. Finally, our calculation shows that the phonon spectrum remains stable after inserting K atoms into the system. Graphite has been widely used as an anode material in lithium ion batteries due to its high theoretical capacity [1] . However, it suffers from low electrical conductivity [2] , leading to poor rate capability [3] .\nRecently, potassium ions are considered as promising candidates to replace Li + because they possess higher ionic mobility [4] . It was reported that the insertion voltage of K + \/K is 0.3 V lower than that of Li-ion\/Li [5] . Moreover, the diffusion coefficient of K + is about three orders of magnitude larger than that of Li + [6] .

{"text":"We present an explicit construction of nilpotent supersymmetry transformations for Abelian and non-Abelian 1-form gauge fields, which are formulated as components of chiral N=1 superfields. The corresponding action is invariant under these transformations up to total derivatives. We show that this theory can be obtained by dimensional reduction of 4D N=2 SYM down to 3D. In addition we discuss how our results generalize to higher dimensions. Introduction: Supersymmetric field theories have been studied extensively over last decades due to their remarkable properties such as unitarity and renormalizability [1, 2] . One of the most important features of supersymmetric models is the presence of fermionic partners of bosonic degrees of freedom with opposite statistics. These new particles lead to additional symmetries called supersymmetries. It has been shown that all known fundamental interactions including gravity can be described within the framework of supersymmetric quantum mechanics [3] .\nIn recent years there was renewed interest in supersymmetric field theories motivated by developments in string\/M-theory [4] , where they appear naturally on various brane configurations [5] . Moreover, it turns out that many interesting phenomena observed at high energies may find natural explanation within the context of supersymmetric extensions of Standard Model [6] . For example, supersymmetry provides elegant solution to hierarchy problem [7, 8] or offers possible candidates for dark matter [9] .\nThe simplest supersymmetric extension of Standard Model contains only one extra spin-1\/2 particle -the gravitino [10] . However, more complicated versions involving several spin-1\/2 fields exist [11] . A particularly interesting class of supersymmetric models involves so-called extended supersymmetry [12] . This includes N = 2 supersymmetry [13] , which appears in M-theory compactified on Calabi-Yau manifolds [14] , and its further generalization to N = 4 [15] . Another interesting case corresponds to N = 1 supersymmetry [16] , which arises when D-branes wrap cycles of internal space [17] ."}

The former tends to smooth out the QD density profile while the latter leads to its steepening. In particular we find that for small values of the QD size dispersion there exists a critical value of the growth rate above which ordered QD arrays cannot be formed. This result explains why it has been so difficult to grow ordered QD arrays with large QD sizes using conventional techniques. \n \n Keywords: Ordering, Strain Relaxation, Surface Diffusion, Quantum Dot Arrays, Stability, Growth Rate, Molecular Beam Epitaxy \n \n 1 Introduction \n \n Semiconductor nanocrystals or quantum dots (QDs), also known as colloidal quantum dots, have attracted considerable attention due to their unique optical properties [1] .

{"text":"We present an analysis of N-body simulations aimed at understanding how evaporation shapes the mass function (MF) of globular clusters (GCs). We find that, in agreement with previous studies, evaporation causes GCs to lose stars preferentially on their low-mass end and thus steepens the MF slope towards lower masses. However, we show that this effect is counteracted by two competing processes: dynamical friction which removes massive stars more efficiently than less massive ones; and relaxation-driven core collapse which increases the central density of the cluster and makes it harder for massive stars to escape. The net result depends strongly on the initial concentration of the cluster, but typically leads to shallower slopes compared to those observed in real GCs. This suggests that other processes are required to explain the shape of the observed MF. In particular, our results suggest that primordial binaries may be responsible for producing the high-mass power-law tail seen in many GCs."}

It turns out that some of them correspond to stable configurations [6] . However, all previous studies were performed within the mean-field approximation neglecting fluctuations around the ground state [7, 8] .

In particular we find that the number of peaks increases linearly with time while their width decreases exponentially. Finally, we discuss how our results compare to previous work. PACS numbers: 05.40.+j, 47.27.-i Granular materials have been studied extensively over many years [1] . They consist of macroscopic particles (grains) which interact via dissipative collisions [2] , i.e., the normal component of the relative velocity after collision differs from its value before collision due to dissipation [3] . A typical example is sand or glass beads [4] .\nThe dynamics of such systems has attracted considerable interest recently because it exhibits features not found in ordinary fluids [5] . For instance, there exist stationary states where the average particle velocities do not vanish [6] . Moreover, these states may exhibit nontrivial correlations between different degrees of freedom [7, 8] . Another interesting feature is the formation of clusters [9] . It was shown experimentally [10] that even dilute granular gases cool down faster than predicted by molecular chaos [11] . This effect cannot be explained by standard Boltzmann kinetics [12] . Instead, more sophisticated approaches like Enskog [13] or Sonine [14] expansions [15] were developed [16] . However, all these theories assume elastic interactions [17] . Recently, several authors [18, 19] investigated the influence of inelasticity on the properties of granular matter using computer simulations [20] ."}
{"text":"We study the universality of gravitational waves (GWs) generated by cosmic string loops and their decay products, which are known as primordial black holes (PBH). We show that PBH can be produced with masses ranging from $10^{16}$ to $10^{20} \\sim 10^{22}$ g depending on the initial loop size distribution. The mass spectrum is determined by the number density of PBH at present time. In particular, we find that the abundance of PBH depends strongly on the power index $\\alpha$ of the loop size distribution $P(l)\\propto l^{\\alpha-1}$. For example, if $\\alpha = -1$, then the fraction of dark matter contributed by PBH becomes $1-F_PBH=0.01-0.1 \\sim 1$ for $M_{PBH}\\sim 10^{18}g$. This result implies that GW observations may provide us an important clue about the origin of cosmic strings. \n \n Introduction \n \n Cosmic strings [1] have been studied extensively since they were first proposed [2] . They could play an important role in cosmology because they might generate various interesting phenomena such as gravitational wave bursts [3] , gamma ray bursts [4] , ultra-high energy cosmic rays [5] , and so on [6] - [8] .\n \nIn this letter, we focus our attention on gravitational waves (GWs), which would be emitted during the formation process of cosmic string loops [9] . If there exist many small loops, then the total amount of GW emission will increase significantly [10] . Therefore, it should be very important to know how much GWs are emitted when loops form [11] . \n \n Recently, several authors [12] - [14] investigated the production rate of GWs from cosmic string loops using numerical simulations. However, these works did not take into account the effect of loop self-intersection [15] . It was shown [16] that loop self-intersections lead to significant changes in the evolution of loop sizes [17] . Thus, one cannot ignore them even though the probability of loop self intersection decreases rapidly with increasing loop length [18] ."}
{"text":"The present work is devoted to the study of some new effects in the process of combustion of liquid fuels, which are observed under the action of laser radiation with different wavelengths and power densities on the fuel surface. The results obtained show that the use of pulsed lasers can significantly increase the efficiency of burning liquid fuels by increasing their evaporation rate due to the formation of plasma at the fuel surface. In addition, it was found that the presence of an additional source of energy (laser) leads to changes in the structure of the flame front, as evidenced by the appearance of bright spots near its edge. It has been shown experimentally that these spots correspond to local increases in temperature up to several thousand degrees Celsius. This phenomenon may be used for creating highly efficient heat sources based on the combustion of liquid fuels. \n \n Keywords: Flame, Laser, Combustion, Evaporation, Plasma"}
{"text":"We present an overview of the theory and practice of nonparametric regression, with emphasis on its application in physics. We begin by introducing some basic concepts such as kernel density estimation (KDE) and spline smoothing. Then we discuss how these methods can be used for data analysis problems that arise frequently in physics experiments. Finally, we provide several examples illustrating our discussion. The goal is not only to introduce readers unfamiliar with this topic but also to give physicists who are familiar with it a new perspective on their work. This article serves as a companion piece to another one entitled \"Statistical Modeling of Physical Laws\" which appeared earlier in ArXiv.org. In that article, we introduced the concept of parametric models and discussed how they can be applied to solve various types of data analysis problems encountered in physics experiments. Parametric models assume that all unknown parameters have been determined exactly beforehand; however, in many cases there may exist uncertainty about those values due to limited experimental precision or lack of knowledge. Nonparametric regression provides a way around this problem by allowing us to estimate the functional form of the underlying model without making any assumptions about the exact value of each parameter."}
{"text":"We present new results on the timing and lensing properties of two colliding galaxy clusters, Abell 520 (z = 0.2) and Abell 521 (z = 0.3). We find that the collision is occurring at an angle of ~45 degrees with respect to our line-of-sight. The mass distribution in each cluster has been determined by fitting parametric models to strong gravitational lensing data obtained using Hubble Space Telescope images. Using these models we have calculated the expected arrival times for multiply-imaged background galaxies as well as their magnifications. These predictions are compared directly against observations made using the Advanced Camera for Surveys aboard HST. In addition, we use the observed positions of multiple images of lensed quasars behind both clusters to measure the relative velocity between them. Our analysis shows that there is only marginally more than sufficient time available before the collision occurs for the dark matter halos to be accelerated up to the current velocities inferred from the lensing measurements."}

{"text":"We present the first calculation of quark-quark scattering at next-to-leading order (NLO) accuracy within the framework of multiple parton scattering (MPI). We show that this process is dominated by gluons and quarks with small transverse momenta, which are produced via initial state radiation off one or both incoming hadrons. The cross section for quark-quark scattering can be written as an integral over the transverse momentum distribution of these radiated particles times their squared matrix element. This allows us to calculate the total cross section using standard Monte Carlo techniques. In addition we provide analytic expressions for the differential distributions in rapidity and azimuthal angle between the outgoing quarks. Our results agree well with those obtained numerically.

{"text":"We report the Langmuir Blodgett (LB) deposition of highly ordered, dense arrays of vertically-aligned single-walled carbon nanotube films on solid substrates using an aqueous dispersion containing surfactant and sodium dodecyl sulfate as dispersing agents. The LB technique is used to transfer these films onto various substrate materials such as silicon wafers, quartz slides, glass coverslips, gold-coated glass coverslips, and indium tin oxide coated glass coverslips. We have also demonstrated that this method can be extended for patterned growth by transferring the film selectively over areas defined by photoresist patterns. These results are important in developing new applications based on carbon nanotubes. \n \n Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), which were discovered about ten years ago, have attracted considerable attention because they possess unique physical properties including high electrical conductivity, mechanical strength, thermal stability, chemical inertness, etc., making them promising candidates for many potential applications ranging from field emission devices to sensors and optoelectronic devices1-5. However, most of their practical uses require CNT networks with controlled orientation and density6-8. In recent years, several methods have been developed to prepare oriented CNT films9-12. Among those techniques, Langmuir-Blodgett (LB)\ndeposition has emerged as one of the most powerful approaches13-15. This process involves spreading a monolayer of amphiphilic molecules at the air-water interface followed by vertical dipping of a hydrophobic substrate into the water subphase16-18. By repeating the above steps, multilayered thin films consisting of closely packed CNTs can be obtained19-21.

This is confirmed by STM measurements which reveal a corrugated structure for all sizes investigated here. In addition to this common feature we find two different types of structures depending on dot size. For small dots (10-20 nm in diameter) we observe a dome-like shape while larger dots (40-60 nm in diameter) exhibit a flat topography. Both shapes can be explained by assuming either a core-shell model or a porous structure. We also found that the magnetic behavior depends strongly on the dot size. While large dots behave like bulk material they show superparamagnetism at room temperature when their diameter decreases below 40 nm."}

{"text":"We study the circular and non-circular motion near the event horizons of rotating black holes by using the Hamilton-Jacobi method, which is an extension of the standard geodesic approach to include higher-order corrections due to gravitational radiation reaction effects. We find that for both circular and non-circular motions there exist two families of solutions with different orbital frequencies at the same radius. The inner family has smaller orbital frequency than the outer one; it corresponds to bound orbits while the outer solution describes unbound orbits. For circular orbits we show how these results can be obtained directly from the first law of black hole mechanics. In addition, we also present numerical evidence showing that the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) moves inward as the spin parameter increases. Finally, we discuss some implications of our results on astrophysical phenomena such as accretion disks around spinning black holes. Introduction -The discovery of the first binary pulsar PSR1913+16 [1] , together with its subsequent measurement of the mass ratio between the neutron star and its companion white dwarf [2] , led to the prediction [3] that most likely all massive stars end their lives as black holes surrounded by accretion disks [4] . Since then many other observations have been made confirming this picture [5] .\nIn order to understand the dynamics of matter falling into black holes, it is important to know where particles are trapped or scattered out [6] . This information is encoded in the location of the so-called Innermost Stable Circular Orbit (ISCO), i.e., the smallest possible radius r ISCO of a particle's circular orbit [7, 8] . It turns out that the value of r ISCO depends sensitively on the spin angular momentum J = Ma 2 \/(2r g ) of the black hole [9] : if J < M 2 , then r ISCO > 3M ; but when J approaches M 2 , r ISCO decreases rapidly until finally it reaches the Schwarzschild radius R s \u2261 2GM\/c 2 [10] . Therefore, knowing the exact position of the ISCO will help us better understand the physics behind various processes taking place close to"}

In particular, we consider stationary states which correspond to condensate configurations without rotation (vortex-free) as well as rotating ones where quantized angular momentum is carried by phase singularities known as vortices. Finally, we briefly describe recent experiments on vortex production in cold atom clouds. Vortices occur naturally in superfluids such as liquid helium or dilute atomic gases.

{"text":"We have studied the spin relaxation and dephasing processes in semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) by solving numerically the full set of equations for electron-electron interactions within the framework of the equation-of-motion method. We found that, at low temperatures, the dominant mechanism responsible for spin relaxation is due to spin-flip scattering with acoustic phonons. The calculated results are compared favorably with available experimental data on QD ensembles. In addition, we show that the inclusion of exchange interaction between electrons leads to an increase in the spin relaxation time as well as to a reduction in its temperature dependence. \n \n Spin dynamics plays an important role in many physical phenomena such as magnetic resonance imaging [1] , magneto-optical effects [2] , and spintronics [3] . Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs), which can be viewed as artificial atoms [4] , provide us with unique opportunities to study spin relaxation and dephazing mechanisms [5] - [8] . Recently, there has been considerable interest in studying these issues both experimentally [9] - [11] and theoretically [12] - [16] .\nIn this work, we investigate spin relaxation and dephazation processes in QDs using the equation-of-motion (EOM) method [17] . This method allows one to take into account all possible contributions to the self-energy arising from different types of electron-electron interactions including direct Coulomb repulsion, exchange-correlation potential, Hartree-Fock corrections, and correlation energy [18] . It should be noted that our calculations were performed without any additional approximations beyond those used in previous studies based on the EOM formalism [19] - [21] . \nThe obtained numerical results demonstrate that, at low temperatures T < 10 K, the main contribution to spin relaxation comes from spin-flip scattering with acoustic-phonon modes [22] . At higher temperatures, however, other mechanisms become more significant leading to faster spin relaxation times.

We find that there is no spontaneous magnetization at zero temperature but the system exhibits finite magnetization when it is heated up to certain critical temperatures. The results show that the ground state has antiferromagnetic order while the excited states have ferrimagnetic order. In addition, we also investigate how the external magnetic field affects the magnetization process by calculating the magnetization curve M(H) at different temperatures T = 0.1J, 1.0J, 2.0J, 3.0J, 4.0J (J being the exchange interaction).

{"text":"We present an approach to extract the underlying physics from large sets of experimental data by using machine learning techniques and statistical analysis. The method is applied on two different examples, namely the measurement of the electrical conductivity in doped semiconductors as well as the determination of the critical temperature Tc for superconductivity in cuprates. In both cases we find that our results are consistent with theoretical predictions. We show how this new technique can be used to identify unknown parameters or even completely new phenomena which cannot be predicted theoretically at all. This work was supported by the German Science Foundation (DFG) under grant number SFB\/TRR 191.

To achieve this aim it is necessary to develop methods which allow us to analyze huge amounts of experimental data efficiently. Here we propose a novel approach based on machine learning algorithms combined with advanced statistical tools. Our method is demonstrated on two examples: First, we study the dependence of the electrical conductivity on doping concentration in semiconductor compounds. Second, we determine the critical temperature T c for superconductivity in high-temperature cuprate oxides. For both problems we obtain results which agree very well with existing theories. Moreover, we demonstrate how our method allows one to discover previously unforeseen features in the data."}

We have tested this new version against several test cases including those presented by previous authors. In general we find good agreement between our results and theirs. \n \n Keywords: Accelerated Lambda Iteration, Opacity Sampling, Non-LTE Analysis, Interstellar Medium, Line Spectra, Atomic Data, Computational Astrophysics \n \n 1 Introduction \n \n Absorption lines observed towards distant stars are used as probes into the physical state and chemical composition of gas clouds located throughout space. These observations provide information about the density structure, kinematics, temperatures, ionization states and elemental abundances of these clouds. However, interpreting such data requires detailed knowledge of atomic physics processes occurring inside them which can be obtained only through sophisticated numerical modeling. This task has been traditionally performed using codes that solve statistical equilibrium equations separately for each level of interest. Such methods require repeated iterations over many different models until convergence is reached. As a result they tend to be very time consuming even when applied to relatively simple problems involving just a few hundred energy levels. For example, it takes more than two days to analyze a typical spectrum consisting of thousands of transitions using the most advanced available software package Cloudy [1] . \nIn order to overcome this problem we developed a new computational tool called SPEX [2] , which combines the advantages of both the accelerated lambda iteration [3] and opacity sampling [4] techniques. Our goal was to create a flexible yet robust code capable of solving complex radiative transfer problems efficiently while maintaining high accuracy. To achieve this we implemented a number of novel features including automatic selection of optimal parameters controlling the convergence rate, parallelization across multiple CPU cores, and support for various input formats."}

We prove that such foliations can be approximated in the C 1 -topology by regular ones and give an explicit bound for the approximation error. This result is used to show that any leafwise Riemannian metric on these foliations has bounded geometry. The main tool here is the theory of harmonic maps into Hilbert spaces developed by Eells-Elworthy-Malliavin. In particular, we use the fact that every harmonic map into a Hilbert space is weakly conformal. As another application of our results, we obtain some estimates for the volume growth rate along leaves of such foliations. Finally, using the above mentioned bounds for the approximation error, we also get lower bounds for the number of critical points of generic functions on closed manifolds."}

We used an optimized Tersoff potential for SWCNT and simulated three different types of SWCNTs with diameters 1 nm, 2 nm and 3 nm at temperatures ranging between 300 K and 1500 K. The results show that Young's modulus decreases as the temperature increases while the yield stress remains almost constant upto 1000K but starts decreasing beyond this point. This is due to the fact that thermal fluctuations cause defects in the structure which leads to decrease in strength.

Due to their unique structural characteristics they possess extraordinary physical and chemical properties [2] , such as high elasticity [3] , high electrical conductivity [4] , high thermal conductivity [5] etc., making them suitable candidates for various applications [6] .\nCarbon nanotubes can be classified according to their diameter [7, 8] or chirality [9] . Depending upon these two parameters there exist several distinct families of carbon nanotubes [10] . In general, carbon nanotubes can be divided into two categories namely zigzag tubes and armchair tubes [11] . Zigzag tubes consist of alternating double bonds along its axis whereas armchair tubes contain only single bonds [12] . There exists another type called chiral tube whose helicity lies somewhere between zigzag and armchair tubes [13] . These tubes are characterized by a pair of integers (n,m), where n denotes number of unit cells in circumference direction and m represents number of unit cells in longitudinal direction [14] .

{"text":"The directional information is important to identify neutrinos coming from astrophysical sources, such as supernovae or gamma-ray bursts. In this study we investigate how reliable the incident neutrino directions are reconstructed by using fully contained events (FCEs) and partially contained events (PCEs). We find that the angular resolution of FCEs is better than that of PCEs because of their larger number of Cherenkov photons detected at the detector. The systematic uncertainty of the reconstruction efficiency depends strongly on the zenith angle of the event. For example, it becomes about 10% when the zenith angle is 60 degrees. This effect causes an error in the determination of the energy spectrum of atmospheric neutrinos. However, if one can reduce the systematic uncertainty down to 5% level, then the total flux of atmospheric neutrinos will be determined with accuracy within 20%. \n \n Keywords: Neutrino, Super-Kamiokande"}

The resulting master equations are used to study the effects of environmental fluctuations on the evolution of the density matrix describing the state of the system. In particular we consider two different models of environments corresponding to Ohmic dissipation and spin-boson interaction respectively. For both cases it is shown how the effect of the environment leads to irreversible loss of information about the initial state of the system as well as to thermalization at late times. Finally, we discuss possible applications of our results to problems such as transport through mesoscopic conductors or dissipative tunneling between localized states in disordered solids. Decoherence and relaxation processes play a crucial role in understanding the physics of open quantum systems [1, 2] . These phenomena arise when the system interacts with some external degrees of freedom (environment) whose influence cannot be neglected [3] .\nIn recent years there has been considerable interest in developing theoretical methods capable of treating these effects beyond the perturbative regime [4] . A number of approaches have been proposed ranging from phenomenological treatments based on stochastic Schr\u00f6dinger equations [5] , to more microscopic descriptions using path integral techniques [6] or field-theoretical formulations [7, 8] . However, despite their successes, all these methods suffer from one common drawback: they do not provide any insight into the underlying physical mechanisms responsible for decoherence and relaxation; nor do they allow us to make quantitative predictions regarding the time scales involved [9] .\nRecently, several authors [10 -12] have suggested that the problem may be tackled within the framework of quantum mechanics itself. This idea was first put forward by Feynman [13] who showed that the statistical properties of macroscopic objects could be obtained by averaging over an ensemble of identical but microscopically distinct realizations of the same experiment. More recently, Leggett [14] introduced a method..."}
{"text":"We study the dynamics of random Boolean networks (RBNs) by analyzing their attractors and basins, which are determined by the network's state transition matrix. We show that the number of states in an RBN is bounded above by its average sensitivity (AS), defined as the expected Hamming distance between two randomly chosen nodes at time t+1 given they differed on one node at time t. This bound can be used to estimate the size of the basin of attraction for any fixed point or cycle. In addition, we prove that if AS = 1 then there exists only one attractor with probability one. Finally, we present simulation results showing how our bounds compare against exact values obtained through exhaustive search over small networks. Random Boolean Networks (RBNs) have been widely studied since Kauffman introduced them in 1969 [1] . They consist of N binary-valued nodes connected together into a directed graph where each edge has a weight equal to either 0 or 1. The value of each node i at time step t + 1 depends on the values of all other nodes j at time step t according to some function fji(xj). For example, in Figure 1 , node 2 takes input from both nodes 1 and 3 while node 4 takes no inputs. A sequence of states x1, x2, ..., xt, ... is called an orbit when xi+1 = fi(xi) for every i > 0. An orbit is said to converge to a fixed point or cycle if it eventually repeats itself after a finite number of steps [2] .\nThe behavior of an RBN is completely specified by its adjacency matrix Mij, whose elements represent the weights of edges connecting node i to node j. If Mij = 1, then node i receives input from node j; otherwise, node i does not receive input from node j. Since the output of each node is determined solely by its current state and the states of its neighbors,..."}

{"text":"We present an infrared (IR) survey of the young open cluster IC 348 using data obtained with the Infrared Array Camera on board the Spitzer Space Telescope. The IRAC observations cover a region of about 1 square degree centered at RA = 03h45m, DEC = +26d00m and include all known members of this open cluster within 100 pc as well as many additional candidate members. We identify more than 300 new low-mass stars in the mass range 0.1 to 2 Msun by applying photometric selection criteria based on color-color diagrams and spectral energy distributions. These newly identified objects are distributed over a wide area around the central part of the open cluster where most of its previously known members reside. This indicates that the spatial distribution of these low-mass stars is not limited to the densest parts of the open cluster but extends out into the surrounding field population. Based on our results we estimate the total number of low-mass stars associated with the open cluster IC 348 to be between 1000 and 2000."}

We show that, for any given number of transmit antennas at all transmitters, there exists an optimal number of receive antennas such that the sum-capacity is maximized when all receivers have this same number of antennas. This result holds even if the channels are correlated across time or frequency. The optimal number of receive anten-nas increases as more transmit antennas are used by the transmitters.

{"text":"The STAR experiment at RHIC has measured the three-particle correlation function in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ =200 GeV and 62.4 GeV, as well as p+p interactions at 200 GeV.  The results are compared to theoretical predictions based on hydrodynamic models with different initial conditions for the fireball evolution.  It is found that the data favor an initial state which contains fluctuations in both density and flow velocity.  These fluctuations can be described by a Gaussian distribution whose width increases with decreasing beam energy.  This behavior is consistent with expectations from gluon saturation effects predicted within the Color Glass Condensate framework.

In particular, it was shown that these measurements provide important information about the space-time structure of the emitting source created during the early stages of heavy ion collisions.  For example, the shape of the two-particle azimuthal correlation function depends strongly on whether or not there exists collective flow in the system.  Similarly, the magnitude of this effect also provides insight into how much entropy is produced in the final state.

The phase lag between these two components was estimated to be ~0.1 s using cross-correlation analysis. This result suggests that there exists some physical connection between them. In addition, we detected significant time lags for higher-order harmonics of the fundamental frequency component up to the third harmonic.

{"text":"The present work is devoted to the study of the relationship between two different approaches to geometric complexity theory, namely the one based on the notion of ``saturated'' problems introduced by Mulmuley et al., and that based on ``positive integer programs'' (PIP) developed by Agrawal et al..

In particular, this allows us to prove that all known NP-complete problems can be transformed into their equivalent saturated versions using only polynomial-time reductions. Finally, we give some applications of our results to computational commutative algebra and algebraic geometry. The present work was supported by NSF grant DMS-0504520.

{"text":"The National Science Foundation (NSF) has recently formed an \"Exoplanet Task Force\" with the goal of identifying key science goals for future space missions in exoplanet research, including radio astrometry.  In this white paper we present our vision on how such a mission could be designed to meet these goals. We argue that a dedicated radio telescope is needed to detect and characterize extrasolar planets using their radio emission. The proposed instrument would have unprecedented sensitivity at decimeter wavelengths, allowing it to detect planetary mass companions around nearby stars as well as directly measure the masses of known giant planet systems. This will enable us to answer fundamental questions about the formation and evolution of planetary systems. Keywords: Radio astronomy, Extrasolar planet detection, Planetary system characterization, Space mission concept development. 1 Introduction   The discovery of more than 1000 extra-solar planets over the past decade has revolutionized our understanding of planetary systems beyond our own solar system. However, many important questions remain unanswered regarding the origin and evolution of these systems. For example, what are the physical characteristics of most of these newly discovered planets? How do they form? What happens when two or more planets interact gravitationally? Are there other Earth-like worlds orbiting Sun-like stars within reachable distances?  Answering these questions requires detailed observations of individual planets, which can only be achieved by direct imaging techniques. Unfortunately, current ground-based observatories cannot achieve high enough angular resolution to resolve the majority of close-in planets due to atmospheric turbulence effects.   To overcome this limitation, NASA's Kepler satellite was launched in 2009 to search for transiting planets around bright stars. Although Kepler has been extremely successful, its primary focus is on detecting large planets in short orbits. It does not provide any information on the orbital inclination angle of detected planets, nor does it allow for precise measurements of planet radii and masses. Furthermore, because of its relatively small field-of-view, Kepler misses out on discoveries made outside of its target fields."}
{"text":"We present an exact time-domain analysis for the scattering by cloaks with arbitrary shapes and constitutive parameters, based on the method of moments in conjunction with the generalized sheet transition conditions. The results show that the cloaks can be designed to achieve perfect invisibility at any given frequency range within their operating bandwidths. We also demonstrate how the cloaks can be made broadband through optimizing their design parameters. Finally, we discuss some practical issues related to the implementation of such cloaks using metamaterials. C loak is one of the most fascinating concepts in electromagnetics [1] . It has been shown theoretically [2] , numerically [3] - [6] , and experimentally [7] - [9] that it is possible to hide objects completely inside certain types of electromagnetic cloak structures. However, all existing designs are limited to operate only over narrow bands around specific frequencies [10] .\nRecently, several groups have proposed different approaches to extend the operational bandwidth [11] - [13] . In particular, Li et al. [14] presented a new type of broadband cloaks which were constructed by cascading two or more layers of conventional cloaks together. Although this approach was able to significantly increase the bandwidth, its performance still suffered from significant losses due to multiple reflections between adjacent layers [15] . To overcome these problems, Liu et al. [16] introduced another class of broadband cloaks whose operation relies on the concept of transformation optics [17] . These cloaks consist of concentric shells of anisotropic materials arranged according to the coordinate transformations required to make the inner region appear as if it had transformed into free space [18] . This structure allows them to work effectively across a wide band of frequencies without suffering from large reflection loss [19] ."}

{"text":"The Kuiper belt is the source region for most short period comets, but its formation remains poorly understood. We present results from N-body simulations that show how collisions among planetesimals in Neptune's feeding zone can produce objects with orbits similar to those observed today. The initial conditions are based on models of planet migration during which Neptune migrated outward by about 30 AU before being halted at its current location. Our calculations suggest that the Kuiper belt formed as a result of collisional grinding between bodies whose sizes were comparable to Pluto (r ~ 1000 km). This process produced a population of small bodies with orbital eccentricities ranging up to 0.3. Subsequent encounters with Neptune caused some of these bodies to be scattered into highly eccentric orbits. These results provide an explanation for why there appears to be no correlation between the size distribution of KBOs and their orbital eccentricity."}

{"text":"We present the results of our study on common envelope evolution (CEE) in binary systems with helium white dwarfs and red giant secondaries, using detailed stellar evolutionary models for both components. We find that CEE is very efficient at removing orbital angular momentum when the secondary star fills its Roche lobe during core helium burning or later phases. The efficiency increases as the mass ratio decreases because more energy can be extracted by tidal friction if the primary has less mass than the secondary. \n \n In addition to this effect, we also found that the amount of orbital angular momentum removed depends strongly on whether the system undergoes stable or unstable mass transfer after the onset of RLOF. If the system experiences unstable mass transfer, then it will lose much more orbital angular momentum compared to cases where the mass transfer proceeds stably. This occurs mainly due to the fact that the former case leads to stronger tidal interaction between the two stars which causes them to spiral inward faster."}

The decrease is more pronounced if there are initially many hard binaries or few soft ones. In addition, we show how the number of binaries depends on their binding energy distribution at birth. Finally, we compare our results with observations of real open and globular clusters. Our main conclusions are:  1) Open clusters have fewer binaries than globulars because they lose most of them during early evolution.  2) Binaries can be destroyed by three-body encounters even when the total number of binaries remains constant.  3) Hard binaries dominate over soft ones after several relaxation timescales t rh ."}

{"text":"We study isospin-breaking effects on the production rate for heavy-light mesons (D, D*) and light-heavy mesons (D0, D0bar). We use an effective field theory approach to calculate these rates at leading order in perturbation theory. The results are compared with experimental data obtained by CLEO-c. \n \n Isospin symmetry plays an important role in hadronic physics. It relates states that differ only in their charge but have identical masses. In particular it implies that the strong decay widths of charged and neutral pions should be equal. However, this equality has been experimentally tested down to pion momenta as low as 1 MeV\/c and deviations up to 20% were found [1] . These deviations can be explained within Chiral Perturbation Theory [2] , which predicts corrections proportional to powers of the momentum transfer between initial and final state particles. At higher energies, where the typical momentum transfers become larger than the chiral scale, one expects such corrections to vanish rapidly [3] .\n \nIn contrast, we consider here processes involving two heavy quarks close to threshold. Here, the typical momentum transfers are small enough so that non-perturbative contributions cannot be neglected anymore. As a consequence, even though the mass difference between charm and anti-charm quarks is tiny, there will still be significant differences between the corresponding cross sections [4] . \n \n This effect was first observed more than 20 years ago [5] when studying the production of charmed mesons in electron-positron collisions. Since then many experiments [6] - [8] have measured the ratio of the production rates for different combinations of heavy-meson pairs.

For each point p \\in P^n let T(p) denote the set of all combinatorial types of subarrangements of A containing H_p. Then it follows immediately from the definition that the map p \\mapsto |T(p)| defines a constructible function on P^n.

They provide a powerful tool for studying gauge theories in general relativity [2] , and they play important roles in understanding various aspects of string\/M-theory [3] .\nIn particular, the so-called Penrose limit [4] provides a way to relate scattering amplitudes in gauge\/gravity theories at weak coupling to correlation functions in conformal field theories (CFTs) at strong coupling [5] . Recently there has been renewed interest in the study of twistors [6] - [11] due to their applications in computing scattering amplitudes [12] - [16] . For example, the tree-level S-matrix elements of gluons [17] and gravitons [18] in four-dimensional N = 4 Super-Yang-Mills theory (SYM), which was conjectured to be dual to type-IIB superstrings [19] , were computed via the generalized twistor transform [20] ."}
{"text":"We study the remnants produced by merging two CO WDs with different masses and spin configurations, using fully general relativistic hydrodynamic simulations. We find that for most cases studied here (except when one WD is very massive), the merger product will be an ellipsoidal object surrounded by a thick disk-like structure. The final mass of this merged system ranges between 0.6-1.1 M\u2299 depending on the initial conditions. For some systems we also observe the formation of a thin accretion disk around the central core. In addition to these results, we show that there are several possible outcomes in terms of the amount of material ejected during the merger process. Depending on the total mass of the binary system, the merger can produce either no or significant amounts of ejecta ranging up to 10\u22122M\u2299. Finally, we discuss how our results compare with previous studies as well as future prospects. \n \n Keywords: White dwarfs"}

{"text":"In this study, we propose the spline single-index prediction model for predicting the future values of time series data with unknown functional form and heteroscedasticity. The proposed method is based on the combination of the generalized additive models (GAMs) and penalized regression splines (PRS). In particular, GAMs are used to approximate the unknown function in the original single index model by using smooth functions such as cubic smoothing splines or thin plate splines. Then PRS is applied to estimate the coefficients of these smooth functions. We show that our proposed method can be easily implemented via existing software packages such as R Commander package. Finally, numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to other methods including the traditional single index model, the generalized linear mixed effects model, and the random forest model.

{"text":"The measurement of the aerosol phase function is important for understanding cosmic ray showers and their detection by ground-based experiments, such as those performed with the Pierre Auger Observatory (PAO). The PAO has been collecting data since 2004 in Argentina to study ultra-high energy cosmic rays using an array of particle detectors spread over 3000 km2 on both sides of the Andes Mountains. In this work we present results obtained from measurements made between 2007 and 2009 with the Fluorescence Detector (FD) of the PAO. We have used these data to measure the aerosol scattering angle distribution at different wavelengths ranging from 300 nm to 600 nm. This was done by comparing the observed angular distributions of fluorescence light emitted by atmospheric nitrogen molecules excited by charged particles produced during extensive air showers with simulated ones generated assuming different values of the aerosol optical depth. From our analysis it can be concluded that the aerosol optical depth decreases with increasing wavelength."}
{"text":"We present new near-infrared (NIR) observations and analysis of the young binary system UZ Tau E, which is composed of two T Tauri stars with masses ~0.8 M\u2299 separated by 0. \u2032\u2032 4. The NIR light curves show periodic variations that are consistent with ellipsoidal modulation due to tidal distortion of each star's photosphere as it orbits its companion. We also find evidence for an additional component to this variability; we interpret these data as indicating that one or both components of the binary undergoes periodic episodes of enhanced mass loss at periastron passage. This interpretation is supported by our detection of excess emission in the K-band spectrum during periods when the photometric flux decreases. Our results suggest that the circumstellar disks around each member of the binary have been truncated by their mutual gravitational interaction. In addition, we detect significant changes in the shape of the H\u03b1 line profile over time scales of days to weeks. These changes can be explained if there exists a region of high density gas surrounding the binary orbiting on timescales similar to those observed in the NIR light curve."}
{"text":"We study the effect of removing nodes in scale-free networks with power-law degree distribution P(k) ~ k^{-\u03b3}, where \u03b3 is between 2 and 3. We find that when we remove one node at random or according to its degree, the average path length increases logarithmically as the number of removed nodes grows linearly. \n \n This logarithmic increase can be explained by considering how the removal of a node affects the shortest paths through it. The probability for an edge to belong to such a path decreases exponentially with distance from the deleted node. As a result, most edges affected are those which were close to the deleted node before deletion. These short-range connections form a small-world subnetwork around each deleted node. Removing these local links leads to longer distances within this subnetwork but leaves the global connectivity unchanged. Thus, the overall effect of removing many nodes is similar to adding new long-range links into the system."}
{"text":"We present the results of Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations made with the European VLBI Network (EVN) and the NRAO Very Large Array (VLA).

We find that all these objects are compact in our EVN images; their sizes range from 0.1 to 2 mas. In addition we detect one source which is resolved into two components separated by about 3mas. This object has been previously detected as an extended source using VLA data alone. Our results show that most GPS sources appear unresolved even when observed with baselines up to 6000 km.

{"text":"We present the first measurement of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass function for both early-(elliptical\/S0, Sa-Sb) and latetype (Scd-Sm) galaxies using data from the Millennium Galaxy Catalogue (MGC). We use two different methods to measure SMBH masses - stellar velocity dispersion measurements and bulge luminosity scaling relations. Our results show that there is no significant difference between the SMBH mass functions of these galaxy types at z < 0.1. However we find evidence for an evolution with redshift such that the number density of massive SMBHs decreases more rapidly than less-massive ones. This suggests that the most massive SMBHs are likely to have grown by accretion over cosmic time rather than merging events. These findings will be important constraints on models of SMBH growth and AGN feedback."}
{"text":"We study the effects of the Dirac sea on pion propagation through an asymmetric nuclear medium using chiral perturbation theory (ChPT). We find that the inclusion of the Dirac sea leads to significant changes for both scalar and vector potentials, especially at low density where the vacuum contribution is dominant.

The magnetic properties are studied as a function of temperature up to 300 K and applied field up to 5 T at room temperature.

{"text":"Spiral wave is an important pattern observed in many natural systems, such as chemical reactions and biological populations. In this study we investigate how spiral waves evolve into spatiotemporal chaotic patterns through their interactions with each other using a simple model for plankton population dynamics. We find that when two or more spiral waves collide they can either annihilate themselves or form new spirals depending on initial conditions. The newly formed spirals may also interact with existing ones to produce complex spatiotemporal structures including labyrinthine patterns. Our results suggest that spiral waves are not necessarily stable but could be unstable under certain circumstances. Spiral waves have been found in various physical, chemical and biological systems [1] . They play crucial roles in determining the dynamical behaviors of these systems [2] , e.g., in cardiac tissue [3] , BZ reaction [4] , semiconductor lasers [5] , and plankton ecosystems [6] .\nIn recent years there has been growing interest in studying the formation and evolution of spiral waves [7, 8] . It was shown that spiral waves can undergo different types of instabilities [9] which lead to complicated spatiotemporal patterns [10] . For example, it was reported that spiral waves can become unstable due to collisions between them [11] . This instability leads to the birth of new spiral waves [12] . These newborn spirals then interact with one another resulting in the formation of complex spatiotempual structures [13] . However, most previous studies focused only on local interactions among spiral waves [14, 15] while ignoring possible effects caused by distant interactions [16] ."}

{"text":"We present an approach to the analysis of metabolic networks based on information-theoretic concepts, in particular Shannon's entropy measure. We show that this concept can be extended by considering not only single metabolites but also pairs or higher-order tuples of them as elementary units for measuring entropy. This leads us to define so-called pathway entropies which are used to quantify how much uncertainty is associated with different parts of the network. The proposed method allows one to identify those parts of the network where most of the uncertainty resides. In addition we introduce a novel way of visualizing metabolic networks using these new entropy-based quantities. Finally, we demonstrate our approach by applying it to two examples taken from biochemistry literature. Metabolic networks play important roles in many biological processes such as cell growth and development [1] . They consist of chemical reactions transforming various compounds into each other [2] , e.g., glucose molecules are transformed into energy-rich adenosine triphosphate (ATP) molecules via glycolysis [3] .\nThe study of metabolic networks has been attracting increasing interest over recent years [4] - [8] . One reason for this growing interest lies in their potential use as drug targets [9] . Another motivation comes from the fact that they provide valuable insights into cellular metabolism [10] . For example, the identification of key enzymes involved in certain diseases may help to develop drugs against these diseases [11] . Furthermore, metabolic networks have been shown to exhibit scale-free properties [12] similar to those observed in social systems [13] . These findings suggest that there might exist common principles underlying both types of networks [14] .\nIn order to understand the functioning of metabolic networks better, several mathematical models have been developed [15] - [17] . Amongst others, stoichiometric approaches [18] try to describe all possible states of a given metabolic system mathematically. However, due to the high number of degrees of freedom inherent in such models [19] , it becomes difficult to analyze large metabolic networks [20] .

{"text":"The present work is an attempt to show that the concept of time can be extended into a higher-dimensional space, and that this extension may have important consequences for our understanding of physical phenomena.  The author considers the possibility that there are five dimensions of space (four ordinary spatial dimensions plus one extra temporal dimension) which could explain some of the observed properties of matter such as entropy production and irreversibility.   In particular he shows how the existence of these additional dimensions would lead to a violation of the principle of entropy increase with time, and suggests that this might provide a possible explanation for the arrow of time. This article is available from: http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/astro-ph\/0403070v1. Introduction:  Time has always been considered by physicists as being fundamentally different from other quantities like position or velocity because it cannot be measured directly but only inferred indirectly through its effects on other measurable quantities.  However, recent developments in theoretical physics suggest that we should consider whether the concept of time itself needs to be modified so that it becomes more closely related to other fundamental concepts such as mass, charge and energy.  For example, string theory predicts that all particles are vibrating strings moving along a multidimensional space called \"space-time\" [1] .    Another approach involves considering the possibility that time is not just another quantity but rather part of a larger structure known as spacetime [2] , where the latter consists of both space and time together [3] .  According to this viewpoint, time is no longer regarded as something separate from space; instead they are viewed as two aspects of the same thing [4] .\nIn fact, many modern theories of quantum gravity predict that the universe contains at least three large scale dimensions - namely length, width and height [5] - while also containing a fourth small-scale dimension [6] ."}
{"text":"The concept of molecular descriptors is central to the development of quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs). In this work, we introduce a new descriptor that can be used in QSAR studies as well as other applications where chemical reactivity or selectivity are important factors.  The proposed descriptor is based on an extension of the concept of multipolarity developed by Mulliken. It has been shown previously that the multipole moments calculated using atomic orbital basis sets provide useful information about molecular properties such as polarizability, electronegativity, hardness, softness, etc.. We show here how these quantities may also be related to the electronic energy differences between different states of charge within a molecule. This relationship allows us to define a quantity called the \"multiphase index\" which provides a measure of the relative stability of molecules with respect to changes in their oxidation state. The multiphase index was applied successfully to several test cases including the prediction of the oxidation potentials of some organic compounds."}

It is particularly suitable for parallel computing due to its inherent locality [2] . Recently there have been many successful applications of the LBM to different types of flow problems [3] .\nThe basic idea behind the LBM is to represent the distribution function f(x,t) at each node x of a regular grid by a finite number of particles moving along discrete velocities c i = ci\u0394t\/\u0394x, where \u0394x and \u0394t denote respectively the spatial and temporal resolutions [4] . Then the evolution of these particles is governed by the following equation: \nwhere \u03c4 denotes the relaxation time which controls the rate of approaching towards the equilibrium distribution function f eq i\n. By choosing appropriate values of \u03c4, the macroscopic quantities such as density \u03c1 and velocity u can be obtained through moments of the distribution function:"}
{"text":"We study the phonon-assisted relaxation dynamics of an excited atom trapped by a surface-induced optical lattice (SIL). We show that, for sufficiently deep SILs and low temperatures, the atom can be localized within one well of the SIL with high probability. In this regime we find that the lifetime of the atom is determined by its coupling to bulk acoustic phonons via the deformation potential interaction. The resulting lifetimes are found to agree very well with experimental results obtained on cesium atoms trapped at the interface between two dielectric materials. \n \n Introduction \n \n Surface-induced lattices have been used extensively over recent years as a tool for trapping ultracold atoms near surfaces [1\u20133] . These systems provide a unique opportunity to explore quantum many-body phenomena such as superfluidity [4] , supersolids [5] , and topological insulators [6] using cold-atom experiments [7\u20139] .\n \nIn these experiments, laser light is focused onto the surface of a transparent material which creates periodic potentials along the direction normal to the surface [10] . This leads to the formation of standing waves known as surface-induced optical lattices (SIL) [11] . Atoms confined inside these lattices experience strong confinement perpendicular to the surface while being weakly coupled to the underlying substrate [12] . As a result, they behave like free particles moving in three dimensions [13] . \n \n While there has been significant progress towards understanding the properties of atoms trapped in SILs [14\u201318] , relatively little attention has been paid so far to their relaxation dynamics [19, 20] . Here we consider the case where an atom is initially prepared in an excited state |e\u27e9 above some energy threshold E0. If the initial excitation energy exceeds the depth of the SIL V0 then it will escape into the continuum [21] . However if the initial energy lies below E0 but still exceeds the recoil energy ER = 2 kL2 \/ 2mL [22] , where mL denotes the mass of the atom and kL is the wavevector associated with the lattice periodicity, then the atom may relax back down to the ground state |g\u27e9 through emission of a"}

{"text":"The influence of pulsed magnetic fields on the relaxation processes in HTSC was investigated by measuring the temperature dependence of resistance and Hall coefficient for samples with different oxygen content (d = 0, 1). The results show that the application of pulsed magnetic fields leads to an increase in the resistivity and Hall mobility of the sample with d = 0. This effect is explained as due to the appearance of additional scattering centers caused by defects formed during the process of magnetization reversal. In contrast, no significant changes were observed in the case of the sample with d=1. It can be assumed that this difference is associated with the presence of structural disordering in the crystal lattice of the latter compound. \n \n Keywords: High-Tc Superconductor, Pulsed Magnetic Field, Relaxation Processes, Defects Formation, Magnetoresistance, Hall Effect.

{"text":"We report trigonometric parallax measurements for four high proper motion (HPM) white dwarfs with tangential velocities greater than 400 km\/sec, and distances between 50 pc to 100 pc. The HPMs are all members of the Galactic halo population based on their kinematics. We find that three out of these four stars have masses less than 0.5 Msun which is consistent with theoretical predictions for white dwarfs in this mass range. However one star has an unexpectedly large mass of 1.1 Msun. This may be due to unresolved binarity or it could represent a new class of massive white dwarfs. These results will help us understand how the Galactic halo formed. \n \n Keywords: High Proper Motion Stars, White Dwarf, Parallax Measurement, Halo Population \n \n \n \n INTRODUCTION \n \n In recent years there has been considerable interest in studying the properties of high proper motion (HPM) white dwarfs because they can provide important information about the formation history of our Galaxy. For example, by measuring the space motions of individual objects we can determine whether they belong to the thin disk, thick disk, or halo populations. Furthermore, if we know the distance to each object then we can estimate its age using cooling models. Finally, accurate photometry combined with spectroscopy allows us to measure atmospheric parameters such as effective temperature, surface gravity, and chemical composition. All of these quantities together give us valuable insight into the evolution of the Milky Way. \n \n There are several ongoing surveys dedicated to finding HPM white dwarfs including the Palomar Observatory Sky Survey (POSS), SuperCOSMOS Sky Survey (SSS), Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), UK Schmidt Telescope Photometric H-Alpha Survey (UKSTPHAS), and Panoramic Survey Telescope & Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS).

{"text":"We present results for the growth rates and eigenfunctions of unstable modes in rotating, magnetized neutron star models with realistic equations of state (EOS). We use an axisymmetric general relativistic stellar structure code to evolve sequences of equilibrium configurations that are perturbed by small-amplitude perturbations in density or magnetic field strength. The resulting linear stability analysis shows that there is no significant difference between the growth rates obtained using either perturbation type. For all EOS considered here we find that the fastest growing mode has toroidal parity and corresponds to the lowest-order non-axisymmetric deformation of the star. This mode can be identified as the l = m = 1 f-mode of the nonrotating limit. In addition, we find another unstable mode which grows slower than the f-mode but faster than any other unstable mode found so far. It turns out that this second mode always has poloidal parity and thus cannot be associated with any known normal mode of the unperturbed configuration."}
{"text":"We study evolutionary games played by agents that are randomly distributed over the nodes of an unstructured network, and interact only with their immediate neighbors in this network. We show how to compute Nash equilibria for such games using local computations at each node. Our approach is based on computing best responses locally at every agent's neighborhood, which we then use as input to a global algorithm that computes all Nash equilibria. The main technical challenge lies in showing that our local algorithms terminate after polynomially many rounds (in terms of the number of players), even though they may be executed concurrently across different parts of the network. This result holds under mild assumptions about the underlying interaction graph. In particular, it applies to any undirected connected graph where there exists some constant upper bound on the degree of its vertices. As a consequence, we obtain polynomial-time algorithms for finding Nash equilibria in several classes of games including congestion games, matching pennies games, and coordination games."}
{"text":"We study the torsional oscillations of an inhomogeneous magnetic flux tube with longitudinal density variation and uniform twist, which is embedded into a gravitationally stratified atmosphere. The governing equations are derived by using the thin-tube approximation for both equilibrium state and linear perturbations.

One type has its maximum amplitude at the footpoint while another one has it near the apex. For each mode we calculate the frequency as well as the damping time due to radiative loss. It turns out that the frequencies of these modes depend on the density contrast between the base and top of the loop. In addition, they also depend on the ratio of the Alfv\u00e9n speed inside the loop to that outside. Finally, we discuss how our results can be applied to observations.

{"text":"Turbo codes are powerful error correcting codes that have been adopted in several wireless standards, such as WiMax and 3GPP-LTE. However, their performance is limited by an error floor at high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). In this work we propose pseudo-random puncturing for turbo codes which can be used to lower the error floor. The proposed technique exploits the correlation between parity bits generated by different component encoders within a turbo code. We show through simulation results that our method outperforms existing techniques with respect to both coding gain and bit error rate (BER) performance. Finally, we present some practical considerations on how to implement the proposed scheme efficiently. \n \n Turbo codes were invented by Berrou et al., [1] and they are powerful error-correcting codes that have been widely adopted in many communication systems including WiMAX [2] , DVB-S2 [3] , and 3GPP-LTE [4] .

{"text":"The metal-insulator phase diagram of the quasi-one dimensional organic conductor (TMTSF2)2SO3 has been investigated using infrared spectroscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy at temperatures down to 20 mK. The temperature dependence of the optical conductivity shows that the charge gap opens below TMI = 135 K, which is consistent with previous results obtained on single crystals grown under different conditions. In addition we find evidence for an additional energy scale associated with the formation of excitons near 50 meV. We show that this feature can be explained within a simple model based on electron-phonon interaction between molecular orbitals. Finally, our data reveal that the electronic structure changes significantly across the metal-insulator transition. This finding suggests that the insulating state may not simply result from localization effects but rather involves strong correlations among electrons. The metal-insulator phase diagram was studied in detail by infrared spectroscopy and scanning tunnel microscopy experiments performed on high-quality single crystals of (TMTSF)2SO3. Our measurements provide direct spectroscopic evidence for two distinct energy scales involved in the opening of the charge gap as well as for significant modifications of the electronic structure across the metal-insulator boundary."}
{"text":"We present an analysis of the reality conditions for the expectation values of the total linear and angular momenta operators in quantum mechanics, using the method developed by Schwinger to study the spin-1\/2 particle. We show that these quantities are real if they satisfy certain constraints on their matrix elements between arbitrary eigenstates of the system's Hamiltonian operator. These results can be used as a guide when studying systems with more complicated internal degrees of freedom than those considered here. The problem is formulated within the framework of relativistic quantum field theory (QFT), where it has been shown that the vacuum state carries non-vanishing amounts of both linear and angular momenta. In this context we also discuss how our findings relate to previous work done on the subject. Introduction - Quantum mechanical expectation values of observables play a fundamental role in physics. For example, the mean value of position gives information about the center-of-mass motion of particles or fields, while the mean value of energy determines whether a given physical situation corresponds to equilibrium or not. However, there exist other important quantities whose expectation values cannot always be determined experimentally because they do not commute with the system's hamiltonian. This is the case, e.g., of the total linear and orbital angular momenta which have no classical counterparts but nevertheless carry non-trivial physical meaning [1, 2] . Indeed, the vacuum state |0\u27e9 of QFTs carries non-zero amounts of both types of momenta [3] , so that one may wonder what happens to them when the system evolves into excited states [4] .\nIn order to answer such questions, it is necessary to determine under which circumstances the expectation values of the corresponding operators are real-valued functions of time. It turns out that this question is intimately related to the issue of determining the reality conditions satisfied by the components of the wave function describing the system [5] . A detailed discussion of this point will be presented below."}
{"text":"The effect of adding small amounts (0.5-2%) of the light unsaturated hydrocarbons, allene or propyne to rich methane\/air mixtures is investigated experimentally in this study using counterflow diffusion flames at atmospheric pressure. The flame structure is examined with OH* chemiluminescence imaging and laser induced fluorescence measurements for CH2O and CH3O radicals. It was found that both additives have similar effects on the flame structure; they increase the flame temperature slightly but decrease significantly the maximum mole fraction of OH radical. This leads to an increased soot formation rate as evidenced by the higher soot volume fractions measured downstream of the flame front. In addition, it has been observed that the presence of these additives increases the flame speed.  These results are discussed in terms of chemical kinetic mechanisms involving reactions between hydrocarbon species and oxygen atoms.

{"text":"We study the exponential growth rate of a typed branching diffusion, which is an extension of the classical Galton-Watson process to allow for multiple types and non-Markovian reproduction laws. We show that this quantity can be expressed as the solution of a fixed point equation involving the Laplace transform of the offspring distribution. This allows us to prove existence and uniqueness results under mild conditions on the offspring distributions. In particular we obtain explicit bounds on the exponential growth rate when all offspring distributions are Poisson or geometric. Finally, we provide some examples illustrating our main result. Keywords: Branching processes; Typed branching diffusions; Exponential growth rate; Fixed-point equations. 1 Introduction Let (Zt) t\u22650 denote a continuous-time branching diffusion with Z0 = 0. The population size at time t \u2265 0 is given by Nt := sup{n \u2208 N : Zn \u2264 t} where (Zn) n\u2208N denotes the family tree associated with the branching diffusion up to generation n. For each i \u2208 {1, . . . , m} let Pi(\u00b7), qi(\u00b7) and Fi(\u00b7) respectively denote the probability generating function, mean number of children and offspring distribution of type-i individuals. Then it follows from [21, Theorem 1] that there exists a unique positive real number \u03bb such that E[exp{\u2212\u03bbNt}|Ft] < \u221e for every t > 0, where Ft denotes the filtration generated by the branching diffusion up to time t.

That is, \u03bb equals the exponential growth rate of the total population size. If additionally the offspring distributions Fi belong to the domain of attraction of a stable law with index \u03b1i \u2208 (1, 2] then \u03bb also coincides with"}

{"text":"We study how the evolution of the Carter constant depends on the spin and mass ratio in binary systems with spinning black holes, using numerical relativity simulations. We find that the dependence is weak when the spins are aligned or antialigned but strong when they have an intermediate angle between them. The results suggest that it may be possible to measure the black hole's quadrupole moment by observing gravitational waves emitted during the late stages of inspiral. This would provide information about the spacetime geometry near the horizon which cannot be obtained otherwise. \n \n Introduction \n \n In this work we investigate how the evolution of the so-called Carter constant depends on the black-hole spin and mass-ratio in binary systems containing two spinning black holes. The Carter constant is one of several constants of motion associated with geodesic orbits around Kerr black holes (Carter 1968). It can be used as a probe of the spacetime geometry close to the event horizon because its value changes significantly over time only if there exists significant deviation from spherical symmetry at small radii (Bardeen 1973; Thorne et al. 1986 ). For example, the presence of a massive accretion disk will lead to a change in the Carter constant even though the total angular momentum of the system remains unchanged (Kerr 1963). \n \n Previous studies have shown that the orbital evolution of binaries with non-spinning components is affected by the black-hole quadrupole moment Q = M(1 \u2212 S2)\/c2R2 where S denotes the dimensionless spin parameter of each black hole (Damour & Nagar 1999) . However, these effects become negligible once the black holes reach their final plunge phase due to rapid orbital decay caused by emission of gravitational radiation. On the other hand, recent observations indicate that many galactic nuclei contain supermassive black holes whose masses range up to 10^9 solar masses (e.g., Gebhardt et al. (2000)). These objects are expected to evolve through multiple phases of mass transfer before reaching their final state of coalescence. During such evolutionary processes, the black holes could acquire large amounts of angular momentum via tidal interactions and\/or"}

The proposed method can be used to evaluate how much damage a network can tolerate before it loses its function and what kind of lesion causes such loss of functionality. We apply our simulation results to two types of brain networks: functional connectivity (FC) networks derived from resting-state fMRI data and structural covariance (SC) networks obtained by analyzing diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Our results show that FC networks are more vulnerable than SC networks when they suffer from random or targeted attacks. In addition, we find that both FC and SC networks have higher tolerance levels under random attack compared with targeted attack. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed approach could provide useful insights into understanding the vulnerability of human brain networks. Keywords: Brain network, Lesion, Random attack"}

The proof relies heavily on results obtained recently by Krylov and Rozovskii (Annals of Probability, vol. 31, no. 1, pp. 1-40) concerning the ergodicity of diffusion processes in bounded domains. In particular we use their result about the convergence rate of the transition density function towards its equilibrium distribution. As applications we study two examples.

{"text":"The stopping power for uranium ions was measured at the National Superconducting Cyclotrons Laboratory (NSCL) using a thick target method and an ion chamber placed downstream of the target.  The results are compared to calculations based on the TRIM code, which is used extensively by nuclear physicists studying heavy-ion reactions. A good agreement between experiment and theory has been found over most of the range studied here. However, there appears to be some discrepancy near the end of the range where the experimental data show less stopping than predicted by the TRIM calculation. This may indicate that the TRIM model underestimates the contribution of electronic excitation processes to the total stopping cross section. These measurements provide useful information about the behavior of uranium ions as they slow down through matter. They can also serve as input parameters into models describing the transport of energetic particles in matter. Stopping powers were determined experimentally for uranium ions incident upon thin targets of carbon, copper, gold, silver, lead, tin, aluminum, iron, nickel, titanium, molybdenum, tungsten, tantalum, niobium, zirconium, hafnium, ytterbium, and uranium metal.

{"text":"We propose to geometrically engineer the standard model by locally unfolding three families out of the exceptional Lie group $E_8$, which is the largest simple Lie group in nature and has been extensively studied for its role as the gauge symmetry group at high energies. We show that this can be achieved by introducing an extra dimension with two orbifold fixed points on topologically non-trivial cycles of the base manifold. The resulting theory contains chiral fermions localized near these fixed points, while vector-like particles are distributed over the entire space-time. In addition we find that there exist exactly three generations of quarks and leptons whose masses are determined by their positions along the extra dimension. This mechanism provides a natural explanation why only three generations occur in nature without any fine-tuning or ad-hoc assumptions about the underlying physics. Furthermore it allows us to predict the mass spectrum of all known elementary particles including neutrinos."}

They also represent potential sources of feedback between AGNs and their host galaxies. However, despite many theoretical predictions about how such winds should behave, direct observational constraints remain limited due to the difficulty of observing them directly. One promising approach involves using high-resolution spectroscopy to study the absorption features produced when wind material passes across the line-of-sight towards the central continuum source.

The RMs are used to probe the large-scale magnetic field in the inner Galaxy on scales ranging from 0.1 kpc to 10 kpc. We find that the RM distribution is consistent with an axisymmetric model consisting of two components: one component associated with the local spiral arm structure near the Sun; another component tracing the global magnetic field of the entire Galaxy. This latter component has a strength of about 3 microgauss within 2 kpc of the solar position, which decreases rapidly beyond this distance. It also shows significant deviations from axial symmetry around the Galactic center. These results provide new insights into the origin of cosmic rays in our Galaxy. They can be found here . Rotation measure (RM) surveys have been widely used to study the largescale magnetic fields in nearby galaxies as well as in distant clusters of galaxies. However, such studies are difficult to carry out towards the central regions of the Galaxy due to strong foreground emission from ionized gas along the line-of-sight. In this work we report a survey of the large-scale magnetic field in front of the Galactic Center using rotation measures of extragalactic radio sources observed by the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA). Our sample consists of 1253 radio sources selected from the AT20G catalog based on their angular distances from the Galactic Center. Their rotation measures were derived from multi-frequency observations carried out between 2007 and 2010. The resulting rotation measure map reveals a clear pattern of alternating positive and negative values across the sky.

This effect occurs even if there are no initial correlations and it cannot be explained within standard Markovian approaches. The phenomenon has been observed experimentally for trapped ions interacting with phonons. \n \n Introduction \n \n Entanglement plays a crucial role in many applications of quantum information theory such as quantum teleportation [1] , dense coding [2] or quantum cryptography [3] .

These studies rely on observations of the broad-band spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of SMBHs over many decades in frequency space. However, because of their enormous distances, direct measurements of the intrinsic luminosities of most AGNs are not possible. Instead, one must use indirect methods such as reverberation mapping or statistical correlations between various properties of AGNs to determine their luminosities. For example, if one knows how much light passes through some region of interest within an AGN then one may calculate its luminosity using simple geometric arguments. Alternatively, if one knows the distance to an AGN then one could measure its absolute magnitude directly. Unfortunately, both of these approaches require detailed knowledge about the structure of the emitting regions which cannot currently be obtained observationally. Therefore, in order to make accurate estimates of the luminosities of distant AGNs, one needs to develop models capable of reproducing the observed SEDs of nearby AGNs."}

{"text":"We report on our analysis of archival Chandra data for the galaxy cluster Sersic 159-03, which shows evidence for excess X-ray emission below 1 keV (the \"soft-excess\"). We find that this feature is not consistent with thermal bremsstrahlung or line emission associated with any known atomic species and conclude it must be due to some other process such as inverse Compton scattering by relativistic electrons. The observed spectrum can be fitted well using an absorbed power-law model plus a blackbody component at kT = 0.2 keV; however we show that this fit is statistically unacceptable when compared against more physically motivated models including a combination of Bremsstrahlung and inverse-Compton emission. In particular, we demonstrate that the inclusion of a second blackbody component improves the quality of the fits significantly over those obtained previously.  Using these new results, we estimate the total luminosity of the soft-excess to be Lx ~ 1045 erg s-1 within a radius of R500 = 2 Mpc. This value is comparable to the bolometric luminosities inferred for several nearby radio halos detected via their synchrotron emission."}
{"text":"We present an analysis of the transition between first stars and second stars, which are formed by gravitational collapse of primordial gas clouds with masses ranging from 10^4 M_sol to 10^6 M_sol.  We show that the formation rate of second stars is suppressed at redshifts z < 20 due to photoheating effects on the intergalactic medium (IGM). The suppression factor increases as redshift decreases because the IGM temperature rises more rapidly than its density. At lower redshifts, we find that the formation rates of both first and second stars increase sharply when the universe becomes reionized. This effect occurs because the ionizing photons produced during reionization heat up the surrounding neutral hydrogen atoms, thereby increasing their Jeans mass and suppressing fragmentation into smaller objects. Finally, we estimate the number densities of first and second stars using our model for star formation history. Our results suggest that second stars may be detectable via future surveys such as LSST or Euclid."}
{"text":"We present the results of our kinematical study of globular clusters in M31, based on high-resolution spectroscopy obtained at the VLT and Keck telescopes. We find that all clusters studied show evidence for rotation around their major axes (with typical velocities of 100-200 km\/s), while only two out of eight objects have significant internal velocity dispersions (of about 50-100 km\/s). The remaining six clusters are consistent with being completely dispersionless systems. This is surprising given that these clusters contain large numbers of evolved stars belonging to extended horizontal branches. Our analysis shows that this apparent contradiction can be explained by assuming that most of the cluster mass resides outside the observed field-of-view. In addition we find that the majority of the clusters rotate counterclockwise when viewed along their minor axes. These findings suggest that many globular clusters may not be fully relaxed dynamical systems as previously thought. They also provide new insights into the formation history of globular clusters. \n \n Keywords: Kinematics"}

The latter is modeled as a harmonic term in the local mean curvature. We show that this model exhibits three phases depending on temperature T . At high temperatures (T > Tc), it behaves like a liquid; at low temperatures (T < Ts) it forms a solid-like state where all triangles are equilateral; for intermediate temperatures (Ts<T< Tc) we find a disordered glassy phase which can be characterized by its fractal dimension D = 2 \u2212 H \u2248 1.7 \u00b1 0.1.

{"text":"In this work, we consider decode-and forward (DF) cooperation among nodes in wireless networks and propose an optimal routing algorithm to maximize the network throughput by jointly optimizing source-to-destination routes as well as cooperative relay paths. We formulate the problem into mixed integer linear programming (MILP), which is NP-hard due to its combinatorial nature. To solve it efficiently, we develop two heuristic algorithms with polynomial time complexity. The first one uses a greedy approach that iteratively selects the best route between each pair of source destination pairs until all flows are routed. In order to further improve the performance, we also design another algorithm using simulated annealing technique. Extensive simulation results show that our proposed algorithms can achieve significant improvement over existing schemes.

INTRODUCTIO N Cooperative communications have been widely studied recently because they provide higher data rates or longer transmission ranges than conventional non-cooperative systems [1] . In particular, decodeand-forward (DF) has attracted much attention since it does not require any extra power consumption at relays [2] .\nHowever, DF-based cooperative transmissions suffer from high end-to-end delay caused by multiple hops involved in forwarding packets [3] , especially when there exist many sources and destinations [4] . Therefore, how to find efficient cooperative relay paths becomes critical to reduce the overall end-to-end delay while maintaining good system performance [5] - [8] ."}
{"text":"We study the dynamics of a probabilistic cellular automaton (PCA) with two species, prey and predators, which interact in an oscillatory way. The PCA is defined on a square lattice where each site can be occupied by at most one particle of either type. We show that for certain values of the parameters there are stable periodic solutions to this system. These results are obtained using a mean field approximation method. In particular we find that the periodicity depends only on the number of particles per unit area. This dependence agrees well with numerical simulations performed on finite lattices. Finally, we discuss how our model could be used as a simple description of population cycles observed in nature. Probabilistic cellular automata have been widely studied during recent years due to their potential applications in many fields such as physics [1] , biology [2] or computer science [3] .

No significant periodicity was found over a wide range of periods between 0.01 s and 10 h. However, we did find evidence for two quasi-periodic oscillations at frequencies of ~0.2 Hz and ~0.4 Hz. These are similar to those seen previously in other CVs containing magnetic white dwarfs. In addition, there appears to be some structure on longer timescales.

{"text":"We study the fractional charge and statistics of elementary excitations in quantum spin systems with frustration, using exact diagonalization techniques for small clusters up to 12 sites. We find that the ground state is always gapped and has no degeneracy. The elementary excitations are fractionally charged fermions or bosons depending on whether the system is antiferromagnetic (AF) or ferromagnetic (F). In AF cases we also observe neutral fermionic excitations which carry zero electric charge but have nontrivial braiding properties. These results can be understood by mapping our models onto effective lattice gauge theories where the elementary excitations correspond to particles carrying flux quanta. Our work provides an explicit example of how fractional charges emerge naturally as topological defects in strongly correlated electronic materials. Introduction:-The discovery of high temperature superconductivity in copper oxide compounds [1] , together with other exotic phenomena such as colossal magnetoresistance [2] , non-Fermi liquid behavior [3] etc., has led to renewed interest in understanding the physics of strongly interacting electrons. One of the most important open questions concerns the nature of the elementary excitations responsible for these novel behaviors [4] . It was suggested early on [5] that the elementary excitations may be described by some kind of collective modes known as spin waves [6] . However it soon became clear [7, 8] that this description fails at low energies due to strong electron correlations. More recently there has been considerable progress towards developing theoretical descriptions based on new concepts like fractionalized quasiparticles [9] , emergent gauge fields [10] , and topological order [11] .\nIn particular, recent experiments [12] suggest that the elementary excitations in the cuprates might indeed be described by some form of fractionalized quasiparticle [13] . This raises many interesting questions about their physical properties including their charge [14] , statistics [15] , and interactions [16] . Unfortunately, despite enormous efforts [17] , a complete microscopic theory describing all these aspects remains elusive [18] . A promising approach involves studying simplified model Hamiltonians [19, 20] whose low-energy limit captures essential features of the original problem [21] ."}
{"text":"In this work, we study the throughput capacity region for multi-hop wireless networks with multiple transmitters and one receiver (MISO-MHWN). We first show that the MISO-MHWN is equivalent to an interference channel where each transmitter has only one antenna but can communicate simultaneously with all receivers in the network. Then, by using the concept of degrees-of-freedom (DoF), which characterizes how many parallel data streams are supported at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, we derive outer bounds on the DoF region of the MISO-MHWNS. Finally, based on these results, we propose a novel transmission scheme called \"Interference Alignment\" (IA) to achieve the optimal DoF region. The proposed IA scheme exploits both spatial multiplexing gain as well as multiuser diversity gain. In particular, it allows different users to transmit their signals over non-overlapping time-frequency resources while maintaining full spatial reuse among them."}

The results show that the magnetic ordering temperature Tmag = 42K agrees well with previous neutron powder diffraction studies. Below Tmag, we observe an antiferromagnetic spin spiral state along the c-axis as evidenced by the presence of two satellite peaks around the main Bragg peak positions. We also find evidence for a weak ferromagnetism below Tmag due to canted spins within each spiral plane. These findings are consistent with theoretical predictions based on density functional theory calculations. In addition, our RXS measurements reveal that there exists a strong anisotropy between in-plane and out-of-plane components of the ordered moment."}

The blue subpopulation is more centrally concentrated than the red one, while both populations show similar radial profiles outside the central regions. These findings suggest that the formation histories of the two subpopulations may be different.

During each outburst, the spectrum softens as the flux decreases. This behaviour suggests that the accretion rate onto the compact object decreases during the decay phase of each outburst. In addition, there are hints of spectral changes between different outbursts; these may be related to variations in the mass transfer rate or the geometry of the system. \n \n Keywords: Supernova remnant"}

However, there remain several open questions about its fundamental structure which motivate searches beyond SM predictions. In particular, it has been known since the early days of quantum mechanics that the SM Lagrangian does not respect all Poincar\u00e9 symmetries [1] . This fact leads to violations of Lorentz invariance predicted by the SM but never seen experimentally [2] .\nIn recent years, interest in models where some or all of these symmetries are broken spontaneously has increased [3] , motivated primarily by the possibility of explaining small neutrino masses via seesaw mechanisms [4] . These models typically involve new heavy fermions whose interactions break explicitly the global symmetry responsible for protecting the massless nature of the SM vector bosons [5] .

We show how this scheme can be implemented into existing MD codes with minimal modifications.

The results presented here are based on joint work with Jens Alcaraz-Garc\u00eda, Daniel Grumiller, David H. Kaplan, Michael L\u00fcst, and Thomas Schroer. In condensed matter physics, it has been known since the 1980s that electrons confined to two dimensions behave like particles called \"composite fermions\" when subjected to an external magnetic field [1] . These composite fermions form a Fermi sea which exhibits fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE), i.e., they exhibit plateaus in their Hall conductance at fractions of e\/2\u03c0h [2] .\nIn recent years there have been several attempts to understand these phenomena within string theory [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] , but so far no complete description exists. One approach consists of studying the low-energy effective action describing the dynamics of the FQH fluid [7, 9] . This action contains a Chern-Simons term coupled to a set of charged scalar fields representing fluctuations around the mean-field solution corresponding to the filled lowest Landau level. It turns out that the resulting system is described by a two-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT).

In particular we show that it is important to take into account both the strength of the correlation signal and its spatial distribution across the detector array. For example, we demonstrate that using only one channel with strong correlations will lead to a significant decrease in planet yield compared to using all available channels. Furthermore, we show that by combining information from multiple channels, it may be possible to detect planets which are otherwise missed due to their small size or low mass. Finally, we investigate the effect of varying levels of RV precision required for confirming planetary candidates detected via transits."}

We find that the horizontal flow pattern consists of two counter-rotating cells which are connected to each other through a narrow channel along their common boundary. This structure resembles the magnetic topology of a bipolar sunspot pair. In addition we observe a small-scale vortex-like feature located on one side of the central upflow region.

{"text":"We study the effect of quenched randomness on interface depinning and roughening, focusing on the case where the interface is driven by an external force applied to all sites at once (i.e., not one site at a time). We find that even for very large values of the disorder strength there are no metastable states, i.e., the interface always moves when it is driven slowly enough. This behavior contrasts sharply with what happens in 1 dimension, where the presence of disorder leads to the existence of many metastable states separated by energy barriers which can be overcome only if the driving force exceeds some threshold value. \n \n In our model we consider a square lattice with periodic boundary conditions and nearest-neighbor interactions between spins. The spin variables take two values: +1 or -1. At each site, the local field acting on the spin points either up or down depending on its neighbors' orientations. If this field has magnitude larger than a certain threshold f0 then the corresponding spin flips. For simplicity, we assume that the threshold fields have equal magnitudes but different signs at neighboring sites; thus, the system evolves according to the following rules: \n \n \n \n Starting from any initial configuration, the dynamics eventually reaches a steady state characterized by a flat interface separating regions of opposite magnetization. When the interface is pinned, the average velocity vanishes as the temperature T goes to zero. However, below a critical temperature Tc(f) the interface becomes unpinned; in other words, the interface starts moving spontaneously whenever the driving force f is smaller than a certain threshold fc(T). \n \n We show numerically that the transition line Tc(f) (the curve above which the interface is pinned) exhibits scaling properties similar to those observed experimentally in magnetic systems such as Fe\/Cr multilayers. Moreover, we also observe that the width w of the interface grows algebraically with time: w ~ talpha, where alpha = 0.5 within numerical accuracy."}

{"text":"We study the propagation of light through an optically thick medium with local field corrections, which is described by a dielectric permittivity tensor that depends on both electric and magnetic fields. We show how this dependence leads to new phenomena such as negative refraction and reduced absorption at certain frequencies. The results are obtained using a microscopic model for the optical response of the material based on quantum electrodynamics (QED). In particular we consider a system consisting of two-level atoms embedded into a host medium made up of polarizable particles. This system can be realized experimentally e.g., by embedding rare-earth ions into glass or semiconductor matrices. \n \n Introduction \n \n Light propagation in strongly scattering materials has been studied extensively over many years [1\u20133] . Recently there have also been several theoretical investigations of light transport in disordered systems where the refractive index varies randomly [4\u20137] , including studies of the effect of nonlocality [8\u201310] . However, most previous works did not take into account the fact that the dielectric permittivity may depend explicitly on the electromagnetic fields inside the sample [11\u201319] . Such dependence arises naturally when one considers the interaction between matter and radiation within the framework of quantum electrodynamics [20\u201322] . \n \n Here we investigate the influence of these so-called \"field-dependent\" contributions to the dielectric permittivity on the properties of light transmission through optically dense samples. Our analysis shows that they lead to novel physical phenomena such as negative refractivity and reduced absorption at certain wavelengths. These effects originate from the interplay between the spatial dispersion of the dielectric permittivity and the presence of strong multiple scattering. They occur even if the average value of the dielectric permittivity does not change significantly upon varying the frequency of the incident wave."}

This effect can lead to changes in event topology and kinematics compared to predictions made using models without CR.  In this analysis we use data collected by the Delphi experiment operating at centre-of-mass energies between 189 GeV and 209 GeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1.1 fb-1.

To overcome this problem, several extensions of SOMs were developed [7, 8] .\nAmong these extensions, growing neural gas (GNG) [9] has attracted much attention due to its ability to automatically determine the optimal number of clusters during training [10] . Nevertheless, it should be noted that most existing models of self organizing network suffer from two main limitations. First, all nodes in the network share the same set of parameters which makes them unable to capture different characteristics of various categories [11] . Second, there lacks any mechanism to prevent overfitting when dealing with high-dimensional data [12] ."}
{"text":"We solve the high energy evolution equation including running coupling corrections in the leading order approximation for the strong coupling constant, and find that the solution is consistent with the asymptotic freedom property at large momentum transfer Q 2 . We also show that our result agrees well with the experimental data on deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) structure functions F(x,Q 2 ) measured by H1 collaboration. \n \n Introduction \n \n In this work we study the behavior of the solutions to the following equation: \n\n\n$$F(x,Q^2) = \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(1-a)} \\int_0^x d\\eta \\eta^{a-1} \\frac{\\langle q(\\eta)q(0)\\rangle}{Q^2} $$\n \n\n where $\\langle q(\\eta)|$ denotes the quark state vector normalized as follows: \n \n $$\\langle q(\\eta)|q(0) \\rangle = 1 - \\frac{1}{2} \\eta^2 + \\mathcal{O}(\\eta^4).$$ \n \n This equation describes the evolution of the DIS structure function $F(x,Q^2),$ which can be obtained through experiments such as those performed by the H1 Collaboration [1]. It has been shown [2] that the above equation admits an exact solution given by: \n \n $$F(x,Q^{2}) = x^{1-\\alpha} \\left[1+ \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n x^{n-2}\\right]$$ \n \n where $\\alpha = a-1\/2$ and $A_n$ are determined by the initial condition $F(x=0,Q^{2})=F_0$ as: \n \n $$A_n = \\frac{2^{2n} n!}{\\Gamma(1+n)} F_0 [(n+1)\/2].$$ \n \n However, it should be noted that the above expression does not satisfy the asymptotic freedom property at very large values of $Q^2$ since the coefficients $A_n$ grow factorially when $n$ increases. Therefore, one needs to consider higher-order terms in the expansion of the integrand in Eq. (1) in order to obtain a more accurate description of the DIS structure function at large values of $Q^2$."}
{"text":"We present new millimeter observations at 1.3 mm (230 GHz) with the Submillimeter Array (SMA), which resolve the dust continuum emission in the protoplanetary disk around the Herbig Ae star HD 163296 into two components, one located close to the central star and another farther out.

The difference between these two methods increases as we go to smaller spatial scales. We also find that the magnetic fields are more inclined towards the solar surface at small spatial scales compared to larger ones.

In order to understand how these phenomena take place, it is important to study their properties individually. However, this task has been difficult because most of them have very fine structure and they often overlap each other spatially. To overcome this difficulty, many observational studies have been carried out recently using high-resolution instruments such as the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope (SST), the New Solar Telescope (NST), the Advanced Technology Solar Telescope (ATST), and the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). Among others, the Hinode satellite launched in 2006 provides us with unprecedentedly high-quality data thanks to its sophisticated instrumentation including the Spectro-Polarimeter (SP) (Lites et al. (2001) ) and the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) (Schou et al. (2010) ), which enable us to investigate the solar photosphere down to subarcsecond resolution. Using these data sets, several authors studied the photospheric magnetic fields (e.g., Ichimoto et al. (2007) , Ishikawa & Tsuneta (2008) , Kitai et al. (2009 ), Orozco Su\u00e1rez et al.

However, many open questions remain regarding the properties of this newly discovered state [4] , including whether it is part of a larger multiplet [5] .\nIn supersymmetry [6] , each SM field has a superpartner differing only in spin statistics [7, 8] . If R-parity [9] is conserved, then all superpartners must be produced in pairs [10] . One consequence of this scenario is that there can exist more than one Higgs doublet [11] . In particular, if the lighter scalar Higgs boson observed at the LHC [12\u201318] corresponds to the lightest CP-eigenstate h0 of such a model [19, 20] , then the next-to-lightest CP-eigenstates H0 and A0 could both couple strongly to fermions [21] .

{"text":"We report on the temporal evolution of step fluctuations under electromigration conditions in Cu(111) and Ag(111). The experiments were performed by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), which allows for direct observation of atomic-scale processes at surfaces. We find that, during current-induced mass transport along steps, the step edges fluctuate strongly with time. These fluctuations are characterized by an exponential growth followed by saturation after about 1 hour. In addition to this general behavior we observe different types of fluctuations depending on the applied voltage and temperature. For low voltages and temperatures below 300 K, the fluctuations show a sawtooth-like shape indicating periodic changes between two states. At higher voltages or temperatures above 400 K, the fluctuations become more irregular but still exhibit some periodicity. Finally, at high voltages and temperatures around 500 K, no regular pattern is observed anymore. Our results suggest that these fluctuations can be explained as a result of competition between diffusion and drift currents."}
{"text":"We propose to probe the nature of dark energy by correlating the morphological properties of galaxies in the nearby universe (z < 0.1) as measured by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), with those at higher redshifts, z ~ 1, obtained from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP). We use steerable wavelet transforms on galaxy images to obtain morphological parameters such as concentration index, asymmetry index, Gini coefficient etc., which are then correlated with their counterparts derived from WMAP data using the same technique. The results show that these correlations can be used to discriminate between different models for dark energy. This is an extension of our earlier work where we have shown how one can correlate the morphology of galaxies in SDSS with CMB fluctuations observed by WMAP. In this work, we present detailed analysis of various statistical tests performed on simulated datasets generated under different cosmological scenarios."}

{"text":"Transit timing is an important tool for detecting planets in multi-planet systems, as well as characterizing their orbits. In this work we present the first transit timing analysis of the Kepler data using the method developed by Agol et al. (2005) to detect additional bodies in planetary systems. We find that there are two new candidate planet pairs around KOI-284 (Kepler Object of Interest 284), which has been previously identified as having three transiting planets. The best-fitting model consists of four planets orbiting one star with periods ranging between 1.5 days and 12 years. This system shows strong evidence for orbital eccentricity among its planets. We also report on another system containing five planets, KOI-377, where our results show that it contains at least six planets. Finally, we discuss how these newly discovered systems can be used to test theories about formation and evolution of planetary systems. Transits provide information not only about the radius but also the mass of exoplanets. However, most known transiting planets have been found through photometric surveys such as Kepler or CoRoT, which do not allow precise measurements of the masses due to limited precision of the light curves. On the other hand, radial velocity surveys usually measure the mass more precisely than photometry does, but they cannot determine whether a given object transits because they lack phase coverage near inferior conjunction. Therefore, combining both techniques allows us to obtain accurate values of the radii and masses of transiting planets. \n \n Here we present the discovery of two new multi-planet systems based on combined photometric and spectroscopic observations made with the HARPS spectrograph attached to the 3.6 m telescope at La Silla Observatory. Both systems contain several super-Earths with short orbital periods. One of them, KOI-284, was already known to host three transiting planets; however, here we demonstrate that it actually harbors four planets. Our results suggest that all four planets have significant orbital eccentricities. Another system, KOI-377, hosts at least six planets."}
{"text":"We present an efficient computational method to compute the elastic properties, vibrational frequencies and normal modes of proteins using finite element analysis (FEA). The proposed approach is based on representing each amino acid residue as a single node in a 3D tetrahedral mesh that covers the entire structure of interest. We show how this representation can be used within FEA to efficiently calculate the stiffness matrix associated with the system under study. In addition we demonstrate how the same representation allows us to obtain accurate results when computing the eigenfrequencies and corresponding mode shapes of the system by solving the generalized eigenvalue problem arising from the discretized form of the governing equations. Finally, we illustrate our methodology through several numerical examples involving different types of proteins. Our results indicate that the proposed approach provides highly accurate predictions compared to those obtained via other state-of-the-art methods such as molecular dynamics simulations or coarse-grained models.

{"text":"We present new results on the distribution of loop widths in active regions observed by TRACE at 171 \u00c5, using data obtained during solar maximum (May-June 2001). We find that loops with different temperatures have similar distributions of widths, which are well fitted by log-normal functions. The mean values of these distributions increase with temperature as expected for pressure equilibrium between plasma confined within magnetic structures and their surroundings. However, we also find that there is no significant difference between the widths measured along individual loops and those determined from averaged profiles over entire active regions. This suggests that the apparent constancy of loop widths may be due to averaging effects rather than being intrinsic properties of coronal structures. In addition, we show that the widths derived from observations made under different viewing angles do not depend significantly on the position angle of the line-of-sight relative to the direction perpendicular to the local magnetic field vector."}

The images show two bright lobes extending to distances greater than 100 AU and separated by more than 50 AU along the major axis of the system's circumstellar disk. We interpret these features as evidence for recent planet formation activity within this protoplanetary disk. This is one of only three known cases where such structures have been observed directly; all other examples are inferred indirectly through modeling or scattered-light imaging techniques. These results provide important constraints on models of planet formation and migration. In addition, we find no evidence for any significant amount of cold dust beyond 250 AU from the central star. Our findings suggest that the outer regions of protoplanetary disks may be cleared out much faster than previously thought."}
{"text":"The cosmic microwave background (CMB) is the remnant radiation left over after the Big Bang, and it provides an important test for theories about how our universe evolved.  In this article we will discuss some recent results on testing string theory using measurements of the temperature fluctuations in the CMB.   We will also describe what these tests tell us about the possible future development of string theory. The cosmic microwave background (CMB; see Figure below ) is the remnant radiation that remains today from when the early universe was only 380,000 years old. It contains information about the physical processes that took place during the first few minutes following the Big Bang. This includes the physics of inflationary expansion as well as the physics of particle production at very high energies. Because of its importance to cosmology, there are many ongoing experiments designed to measure the properties of the CMB more accurately than ever before. These include satellite missions such as WMAP and Planck, which have already produced impressive data sets, and ground-based telescopes like SPT and ACT, which are currently taking new observations."}

We show how these theories can be combined into one coherent mathematical formalism by introducing a new concept called \"state-action value function\". This concept allows us to define a single objective function which describes both the dynamics of the internal states of the brain during emotional experiences and the way in which external actions are selected depending on those internal states. Finally, we illustrate our proposal with some examples taken from experimental data obtained using functional magnetic resonance imaging techniques. In particular, we focus on the analysis of neural activity recorded while subjects were exposed to painful thermal stimulations or when they observed images depicting threatening scenes."}

{"text":"We present photoionization models for the heliosheath, which is the region between the termination shock (TS) at ~100 AU and the solar wind termination shock (SWTS). The SWTS is located beyond 1 AU in the solar system's frame but within 0.3 AU in the rest frame of the Sun. We use these models to constrain the boundary conditions of the heliosphere using interstellar neutral hydrogen data obtained with the Lyman-alpha instrument on board the Solar Wind Anisotropy Probe (SWAP), as well as in situ measurements made near Earth during the Voyager 2 mission. Our results show that the TS distance decreases with increasing solar activity; this effect can be explained by an increase in the density of the solar wind plasma. For low solar activity levels we find that the TS distance agrees very well with previous estimates based on observations of energetic particles."}
{"text":"We present the results of our study on binary models for gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) with progenitors in the mass range 8-40 M\u2299, which are expected to produce GRB jets that can be observed at cosmological distances.

The explosion is triggered by the merger of the components due to gravitational wave emission. In some cases we also find that the system evolves through an intermediate stage where one component collapses to form a black hole while the other explodes as a supernova. This scenario may explain why there seems to exist a gap between the masses of ordinary core-collapse supernovae and those of GRBs. Our calculations show that the total number of such events per year could be up to 10 times higher than previously estimated if the progenitor population extends down to lower masses."}
{"text":"We present an atomistic multiscale approach to the study of charge transport through stretched single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). The method combines molecular dynamics simulations with quantum mechanical calculations on small fragments, which are used as input for a tight-binding description of larger systems.

In particular we find that our calculated conductance agrees well with experiment when using realistic values for the hopping parameters between neighboring base pairs. Our analysis shows that the main contribution to the current is due to electrons localized along the backbone chain. These findings suggest that ssDNA can be considered as a promising material for future applications such as nanoelectronic devices or sensors. \n \n Introduction \n \n Single stranded DNA has been studied extensively over many years both experimentally [1]-[3] and theoretically [4]-[6] . It was found that its structure depends strongly on environmental conditions like pH value [7] , ionic strength [8] - [10] , solvent [11] , temperature [12] , stretching [13] , etc.. This makes it possible to use ssDNA as a sensor [14] - [16] or even as a nanomaterial [17] - [19] . For example, recent studies have shown that ssDNA can form stable helical structures [20] - [22] . Furthermore, it was demonstrated that ssDNA can act as a template for protein synthesis [23] .\n \nIn addition to these structural properties there is growing interest in understanding how charge carriers move through ssDNA [24] - [26] .

{"text":"We present the Hamiltonian formulation for general relativity with matter fields on an arbitrary spacetime manifold, including both classical and quantum aspects. The basic idea is to use the ADM decomposition of the metric into space and time components as well as lapse and shift functions. We then introduce canonical momenta conjugate to these variables which are used to construct the primary constraints of the theory. These constraints generate gauge transformations under which all physical quantities must be invariant. In order to obtain the correct number of degrees of freedom we have to impose secondary constraints that eliminate unphysical modes. Finally, we perform the canonical quantization by promoting the phase-space variables to operators acting on wave-functions defined over superspace (the space of all possible metrics). This leads us to the Wheeler-DeWitt equation whose solutions can be interpreted as probability amplitudes between different states of the universe. We also discuss how this approach could be applied to inflationary models."}
{"text":"We study the optimality properties of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the presence of additive white Gaussian noise, when the input is a binary random variable with equal probabilities. We show that SNR has an upper bound which depends on the probability distribution function of the input signal only through its first two moments. This result holds true even if we allow arbitrary nonlinear transformations at both ends of the channel. The proof relies on the fact that any such transformation can be approximated by a linear one within some small error margin. Finally, we prove that this upper bound cannot be achieved unless the input signal follows a Laplacian or uniform distribution. In particular, it turns out that the maximum value of SNR is attained when the input signal is uniformly distributed over [\u22121\/2, 1\/2] . \nI.

Recently there have been several studies showing how SR may enhance communication between neurons [9] - [11] . However, most of these works assume that the input signal is deterministic [12] - [14] . Only recently researchers started looking into the case where the input signal itself contains noise [15] - [17] .

{"text":"We present the results of an analysis of galaxy-galaxy lensing data for three different types of galaxies in dark matter halos, using the Millennium Simulation and semi-analytic models to predict their properties.  We find that early-type galaxies are aligned with each other along filaments, while late-types show no alignment signal at all.  The intermediate type shows some evidence for alignments perpendicularly to the filamentary structure.  These findings can be explained by tidal torques acting on the gas during its infall into the halo potential well, which is more efficient for early-type than for latetype galaxies.  This effect may also explain why we do not see any significant alignment between the shapes of dark matter haloes themselves. Our results suggest that the observed alignments of galaxies could be caused by large-scale gravitational fields rather than being primordial effects. In this work we study how the shape of dark matter halos affects the distribution of satellite galaxies around them. Using N-body simulations, we investigate whether there exists a correlation between the orientation of the major axis of the host halo and the position angle of satellites relative to it. We find that such correlations exist only if the mass ratio between the primary and secondary halo is large enough (M1\/M2 > 10). For smaller mass ratios, the orientations of both halos become uncorrelated due to dynamical friction."}

{"text":"We propose that the fuzzball proposal for black holes can be extended to include internal degrees of freedom, which are excited by infalling matter and produce Hawking radiation.  We show how this idea fits into the framework of string theory in AdS\/CFT correspondence.

In our case we consider non-extremal black holes whose entropy also matches with the number of microstates in strongly coupled field theories but now including internal degrees of freedom. This leads us to conclude that the emission spectrum of these black holes should agree with the one predicted by Hawking's original calculation.

We show how such FN fields can be incorporated into an effective Lagrangian for leptons and quarks at low energies. In this framework, we derive constraints on the number of FN fields allowed by current experimental data. Finally, we discuss possible implications of our results for models beyond the Standard Model. Introduction - The Standard Model (SM), despite its great successes, does not provide any explanation for why there are three generations of fermions or why their masses differ so much among themselves [1] . These questions have motivated many extensions of the SM [2] , including those based on grand unification [3] .\nIn these theories it has been shown [4] that new sources of CP violation may arise through phases associated with Yukawa couplings between Higgs boson(s) and fermion mass eigenstates. However, since all known particles couple to the same scalar doublet H = (H + , H 0 ) T \/ \u221a 2, one expects that the resulting contributions to CP-violating observables will be too small to explain observed phenomena [5] . This problem could be alleviated if additional scalars were introduced [6] but then other problems would appear [7, 8] . Alternatively, one might consider extending the gauge group [9] and\/or introducing extra vector-like fermions [10] . Another possibility consists in considering more general transformations than phase rotations when constructing the most general form of the CKM matrix [11] ."}
{"text":"We consider the periodic oscillation of an adiabatic piston in contact with two ideal gases at different temperatures and pressures, separated by a rigid wall.  We prove that if the initial state is close to equilibrium then there exists a unique global solution which converges exponentially fast towards its limit cycle as time goes to infinity.  The proof relies on a combination of techniques from nonlinear analysis (Lyapunov functions) and kinetic theory (Boltzmann equation). In this work we study the dynamics of an adiabatic gas-piston system consisting of one-dimensional ideal gases confined between two walls. One of these walls is fixed while the other moves periodically according to some prescribed law. This problem has been studied extensively since the pioneering works of Maxwell [Max] , Boltzmann [Bol1] , and Sackur-Tetrode [Sac] . It was shown rigorously by Cercignani [Cerc] that under suitable assumptions on the motion of the piston, the solutions converge exponentially fast to their limit cycles. However, it seems difficult to extend his results beyond the case where the temperature difference across the piston remains small during all times. Here we show how to overcome this difficulty using new ideas based on Lyapunov functions combined with estimates coming from kinetic theory."}
{"text":"The reaction mechanism for the ring-opening reactions of cyclic alkanes with water has been studied using density functional theory (DFT) and ab initio molecular orbital methods at the B3LYP\/6-311++G(d,p), MP2\/6-31+G*, QCISD\/6-31+G* levels in conjunction with the CBS-QB3 method to calculate enthalpies of formation.  The results show that the activation energies are lower than those obtained previously by DFT or semiempirical methods. In addition, it is found that the transition states have one imaginary frequency along the reaction coordinate corresponding to the breaking of C-H bonds on both sides of the carbonyl group. The calculated rate constants agree well with experimental data over a wide temperature range. Finally, we propose an explanation for the observed differences between theoretical predictions and experiments based on the fact that the solvent effect was not taken into account in previous studies."}
{"text":"We present an analysis on the temperature dependence of Yb3+ doped materials for high power laser applications, with particular emphasis to Yb:YAG and Yb:SYS. The results are obtained by means of numerical simulations based on rate equations that take into account all relevant energy transfer processes between ions as well as non-radiative relaxation mechanisms. We show how these parameters affect the performance of the active medium at different temperatures.  In order to validate our model we compare its predictions against experimental data available in literature. Finally, we discuss possible strategies aimed at improving the efficiency of Yb-doped materials under operating conditions close to room temperature. Lasers have become one of the most important tools in modern science and technology due to their unique properties such as monochromaticity, directionality and coherence [1] . Among them, solid-state lasers (SSLs) represent a very promising class of devices thanks to their compactness, reliability and low cost [2] .\nIn recent years SSLs have been widely used in many fields including medicine [3] , telecommunications [4] , metrology [5] , remote sensing [6] , spectroscopy [7] , optical pumping [8] , etc.. However, despite their advantages over other types of lasers, they suffer from several drawbacks related mainly to heat generation [9] . Indeed, when working at high powers or repetition rates, SSLs can easily reach temperatures higher than 100 \u00b0C [10] which may cause severe damage to the gain media [11] . This is particularly true for Yb-doped materials [12] since Yb3+ has a relatively large Stokes shift [13] leading to poor overlap between absorption and emission bands [14] . As a result, Yb-doped materials exhibit lower quantum efficiencies compared to Nd-doped ones [15] . Moreover, Yb3+ ions tend to aggregate [16] causing additional losses [17] . These issues make Yb-doped materials more sensitive to heating [18] resulting in reduced output powers [19] . Therefore, it becomes crucial to understand the physical phenomena involved in the operation of Yb-doped materials [20] so as to improve their performances [21] ."}
{"text":"We study the scattering properties of surface plasmons (SPs) by a single subwavelength groove in an optically thick metal film, which is excited by a normally incident plane wave with circular polarization. The SP field distribution and its decay length are calculated using the Green's function method for different values of the groove depth hg and width wg. It is found that when the groove depth increases to a certain value, the SP field decays exponentially along both directions away from the groove center instead of being confined within the groove region as before. This phenomenon can be explained by the fact that the SP mode becomes leaky once it scatters into radiation modes through the groove aperture. We also find that there exists another critical groove depth beyond which no SP field can exist inside or outside the groove due to total internal reflection between the groove walls. These results provide useful information on how to design efficient plasmonic devices based on grooves."}

This approach leads to a nonlinear least squares minimization problem which can be solved efficiently using Newton-type iterative algorithms. In particular, we use a quasi-Newton algorithm combined with a continuation strategy to solve our proposed model numerically. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method compared to other existing approaches.

{"text":"In this article, we study the maximum solution to the normalized Ricci flow on closed 4-manifolds with positive scalar curvature and prove that it is unique up to scaling if its volume growth rate satisfies some conditions.  We also show that there are no nontrivial steady or expanding solitons for the normalized Ricci flow in dimension four. Finally, we give an example which shows that our results do not hold without assuming positivity of scalar curvature. Keywords: Maximum solution, normalized Ricci flow, uniqueness, volume growth rate, scalar curvature. 1 Introduction Let $(M,g)$ be a closed Riemannian manifold of dimension $n$. The Ricci flow is defined by $$\\displaystyle g_{t}=e^{-2t}g$$ where $t\\in[0,\\infty[$. It was introduced independently by Hamilton [H1] and by Perelman [P] . In particular, Hamilton proved that any compact 3-manifold admits a metric of constant sectional curvature under the Ricci flow (see [H1, H2] ). On the other hand, Perelman showed that the Ricci flow can be used as a tool to solve the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture and the Thurston geometrization conjecture (see [P] ) . Recently, Cao [Cao3] studied the behavior of the Ricci flow near singularities and proved that the limit space at infinity has finite topological type. Moreover, he gave examples showing that the limit spaces may have different topologies even when they share the same volume growth rates.

{"text":"We study gravitational wave signals from chaotic systems by using the point mass model with an accretion disk around it, which is one of the most promising candidates for gravitational wave sources in astrophysics.  We show that there are two types of gravitational waves emitted from such systems:  The first type comes from the orbital motion of the binary system and its frequency spectrum has peaks at integer multiples of the orbital frequency.  The second type comes from the spiral structure formed on the surface of the accretion disk due to tidal interaction between the central black hole and the surrounding matter.  Its frequency spectrum shows no clear peak but rather consists of many frequencies whose amplitudes decrease as their frequencies increase.  In addition we find that the amplitude of the second type of gravitational waves can be much larger than that of the first type when the spin parameter of the central black hole is large enough (a > 0.9).  This suggests that the detection rate of gravitational waves may depend strongly on the spin parameter of the source if the signal-to-noise ratio is high enough."}
{"text":"We present new optical spectroscopic observations and archival X-ray data for the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 3783, which show that its nuclear activity is dominated by an obscured AGN with a luminosity of ~10^43 erg\/s (2-10 keV). The observed spectral energy distribution suggests that this source has been undergoing rapid changes between two distinct states over the past decade or so; one where it appears to be radiating at close to Eddington limit and another where it is much fainter but still highly luminous. We argue that these variations are likely driven by fluctuations in the mass inflow rate onto the central black hole. This interpretation is supported by our analysis of the time delays between different emission lines as well as their line widths. In particular we find that the H\u03b2 emission line lags behind other lines such as He ii \u03bb4686\u00c5 and C iv \u03bb1549\u00c5 by upto several hundred days during periods when the source was brightest."}
{"text":"In this work, we revisit some issues on netflow sample and export performance in terms of packet loss rate (PLR) and flow sampling accuracy (FSA). We first present an analytical model to study PLR under different traffic conditions with various sampling rates. Then, based on our analysis results, we propose a new method for estimating FSA by using only one parameter -the average number of flows per second. Finally, through extensive experiments conducted over both real-world traces and synthetic data sets, we show that our proposed estimation method is accurate enough to be used as a practical tool for evaluating network monitoring systems. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce related works about netflow sampling and exporting. In Section 3, we describe our experimental environment. In Section 4, we analyze the relationship between PLR and sampling rate. In Section 5, we estimate FSA according to the analysis result presented in Section 4. In Section 6, we evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed estimation method via extensive experiments. Finally, conclusions are drawn in Section 7."}
{"text":"We present an improved version of our previous calculation for the nuclear matter properties and the single-particle energies in spherical nuclei based on the covariant density functional theory with the tensor terms included. The new results are obtained by using the recently developed method to calculate the exchange-correlation contributions to the energy density functionals, which is free from any adjustable parameters. We find that the calculated binding energies per particle agree well with those observed experimentally except for some light nuclei such as 4He and 8Be. In particular, we obtain a reasonable value for the spin-orbit splitting between the p1\/2 and p3\/2 states in 16O nucleus. This indicates that the tensor force plays an important role in determining the shell structure around the Fermi surface.

We find that the IR luminosity is dominated by emission at wavelengths longer than 24 microns, which we interpret as thermal dust emission heated by an active nucleus. This result confirms previous findings obtained using ISO data (e.g. , Rowan-Robinson & Crawford , 1991 ; Haas et al. , 2003 ) , but it also shows that this component can be detected even when the nuclear activity is heavily obscured along our line-of-sight to the central engine. Our analysis indicates that the fraction of absorbed sources increases towards higher redshifts, suggesting that most of these objects are Compton-thick candidates."}
{"text":"We present an approach to quantify the evolutionary dynamics of social groups, based on their internal structure and interactions with other groups. We use this method to study how cooperation evolves in structured populations composed by different types of agents (cooperators or defectors). Our results show that cooperator clusters are more likely to survive than isolated ones when they interact with defector clusters. This effect is stronger for larger cluster sizes. The survival probability decreases as the number of competing clusters increases. Finally we find that the presence of cooperator clusters can lead to the extinction of all defector clusters if there exists at least one large enough cooperator cluster. In recent years it has been shown that cooperative behavior among unrelated individuals may evolve spontaneously even under strong competition between selfish strategies [1-3]. However, these studies have focused mainly on well-mixed populations where each individual interacts equally often with every other member of the population [4] . On the contrary, real-world systems such as biological communities [5] , human societies [6] , or computer networks [7] usually exhibit some degree of spatial organization [8] .\nIn order to understand better the role played by space in the emergence of cooperation, several authors have studied the evolution of cooperation in spatially-structured populations [9] . These works typically consider two main classes of models: lattice-based [10] and agent-based [11] . Lattice-based models assume that the whole population lives on a regular grid [12] while agent-based models allow for arbitrary topologies [13] . Despite the differences between both approaches, most previous work agrees that the topology of the underlying network plays a crucial role in determining whether cooperation will be able to thrive [14] ."}
{"text":"We propose an experiment to entangle two independent photons in the time domain, using only linear optical elements and single-photon detectors.  The scheme is based on measuring the arrival times of the photons at different locations with respect to each other. We show that this measurement can be used to generate entanglement between the photons without any post-selection or feed-forward operations. This method may find applications for quantum communication networks where it would allow one to distribute entangled states over large distances. Entanglement plays a central role in many areas of physics ranging from condensed matter systems [1] , atomic gases [2] , and trapped ions [3] to quantum information processing [4] . In particular, entanglement has been shown to be essential for quantum teleportation [5] , superdense coding [6] , quantum key distribution [7] , and quantum computing [8] .\nIn recent years there have been several proposals to create entanglement between distant particles [9] - [11] . However, most schemes require either nonlinear interactions [12] , which are difficult to implement experimentally [13] , or postselection [14] , which introduces additional noise into the system [15] .

The method is applied to two examples with one or more particles in 1D space. We show that our results are consistent with those obtained by other methods when they exist; otherwise we obtain new insights into the dynamics of these systems. Our approach can be used as a tool for studying the foundations of quantum mechanics, and may also have practical applications such as guiding the design of novel quantum algorithms. Quantum mechanics has been successful at predicting experimental outcomes across many different physical phenomena [1] . However, it remains unclear how this theory should be interpreted physically [2] , especially since its predictions cannot always be reproduced experimentally [3] .\nOne possible way forward is to consider alternative interpretations of quantum mechanics [4] . In particular, there exists a class of theories known as hidden-variable theories [5] which attempt to explain quantum mechanical measurements using additional degrees of freedom not included within standard quantum mechanics [6] . One popular example of such a theory is Bohm's formulation [7, 8] where each particle follows a trajectory through configuration space [9] . This theory reproduces all of the statistical predictions made by standard quantum mechanics [10] but provides a deterministic description of individual measurement events [11] ."}
{"text":"The microlensing technique is used to detect planets by observing the lensing effect that occurs when light passes close to an intervening planet in its path towards us.  The method has been successful at detecting extrasolar planets, but it suffers from low efficiency and high false positive rates.   Ground based surveys are currently being conducted with the aim of improving these statistics.    This thesis describes two ground-based microlensing experiments which have recently completed their observations; OGLE-III (Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment) and MOA-II (Microlensing Observations in Astrophysics).   These experiments were designed to search for exoplanets using the microlensing technique, and they both use wide field cameras mounted on telescopes located in Chile.   In addition to searching for planetary signals, each experiment also monitors millions of stars for variability due to other causes such as stellar activity or eclipsing binary systems.   A total of over one million events were observed during the course of this work, including more than 100 new exoplanet discoveries.   I describe how data was reduced and analysed, and present results obtained from the analysis of the data sets produced by these experiments.

The NIR spectrum shows strong narrow forbidden lines and permitted lines with P Cygni profiles characteristic to AGNs. We have detected blueshifted absorption components on both sides of H\u03b1 and [N II] 6584\u00c5 lines which are likely due to outflows driven by nuclear winds. In addition we found that the observed flux ratio between the two strongest optical emission lines is higher than expected value based on photoionization models.

{"text":"We study the collective behavior of stock prices in China, which is one of the fastest growing economies and has been attracting increasing attention worldwide recently. We find that there are two distinct regimes for the evolution of stock returns over time scales ranging from minutes to months. In particular, we show that the distribution of return fluctuations at short times follows a power law with exponent close to 1.5, while it becomes Gaussian-like at longer timescales. The crossover between these two regimes occurs on a timescale of about 10 days. Our results suggest that the dynamics of stock markets can be described by a simple model based on interacting agents.

{"text":"We study the Frobenius splitting property for Schubert varieties in flag manifolds associated to complex reductive groups, with an emphasis on the case $G = SL_n$ (the general linear group). We prove that all such Schubert varieties are Frobenius split if they have dimension at most two; this is done by using results about the cohomology ring structure of these varieties due to Bernstein-Gelfand-Gelfand. In higher dimensions we show how one can use the theory of G-orbits to construct examples which do not admit any Frobenius splitting. Finally, we give some partial results towards proving that all Schubert varieties are Frobesnius split when $n \\leq 3$ or $SL_3$ acts irreducibly on $\\mathbb{C}^3$. The main motivation behind our work comes from mirror symmetry considerations. Namely, it has been shown recently that certain moduli spaces of stable maps into flag manifolds are isomorphic as algebraic stacks to their own derived categories of coherent sheaves. This isomorphism was proved first for the case where the base field is algebraically closed of characteristic zero, but it should hold more generally over fields of arbitrary characteristics."}
{"text":"We present results on testing different outer boundary conditions in numerical relativity, using two black hole spacetimes as testbeds.  In particular we consider the case where one or both holes are spinning and use several coordinate systems to evolve these solutions numerically.   We find that the choice of coordinates can have significant effects on the accuracy with which the solution is recovered at large distances from the source region. The most accurate results were obtained by evolving the initial data sets in Kerr-Schild Cartesian coordinates (KSC). However, even when evolved in KSC it was found necessary to impose additional constraints near the outer boundaries in order to obtain stable evolutions over many dynamical timescales. These constraints effectively remove all gravitational radiation from the computational domain. Finally, we also considered an alternative approach based on excision techniques. This method involves removing the interior regions containing singularities from the computational grid and replacing them with suitable analytic expressions."}

{"text":"We present the results of spectral analysis for all Swift bursts with measured redshifts and durations longer than 2 s, using data obtained by the Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) on board Swift satellite. We find that most of these bursts are best described as blackbody emission in combination with an additional power-law component at higher energies. The temperature of this blackbody component is found to be correlated with the peak energy of the spectrum E p . This correlation can be explained if we assume that the observed blackbody emission comes from photospheric radius expansion during the prompt phase of the burst. In addition, there seems to exist another correlation between the blackbody temperature T bb , the luminosity L iso and the duration t 90 .\nThe existence of such correlations suggests that the physical mechanism responsible for producing the blackbody emission may also play some role in determining other properties of the bursts. \n\n\nIntroduction\n\nGamma-ray bursts (GRB), discovered more than 40 years ago [1] , have been studied extensively since their discovery [2] .

It has been suggested that they could come from internal shocks [5] or magnetic reconnection [6] within relativistic jets launched by collapsing massive stars [7, 8] . Alternatively, it was proposed that they might result from external shocks driven into surrounding medium [9] . Another open issue is whether GRBs are standard candles [10] .

{"text":"We present the relationship between molecular gas tracers (CO, HCN(1-0), HNC(1-0)) and star formation rate surface density in nearby galaxies using data obtained with Nobeyama 45 m telescope. We find that CO luminosity correlates well with SFR surface density for all galaxy types except low-metallicity dwarf galaxies where we observe an offset to lower LCO\/SFR ratio compared to normal metallicity galaxies. The correlation is better when we use HCN(1-0) or HNC(1-0) instead of CO as a tracer of molecular gas mass. This suggests that there are some physical processes which affect the conversion efficiency of molecular gas into stars depending on metallicity and\/or other environmental factors such as pressure.  These results suggest that it may be possible to estimate total molecular gas content by measuring only one line emission if we know what kind of galaxy we are observing. In addition, our result also indicates that the current calibration factor used to convert CO luminosity into H2 mass should depend on metallicity."}

The results are compared with those obtained by applying continuum ChPT to the same set of lattice data.

{"text":"We present an exact hierarchical description of the reduced state and dynamics of open quantum systems in terms of a set of coupled equations, which we call the Hierarchy of Density Tensors (HDT). The HDT is derived by applying the Nakajima-Zwanzig projection operator technique to the von Neumann equation describing the evolution of the total system. We show that this approach allows one to retrieve all relevant information about the environment-induced decoherence process on arbitrary timescales. In particular, it provides access to the full spectrum of relaxation rates characterizing the decay of off-diagonal elements of the reduced density matrix as well as the stationary states reached at late times. As an example, we apply our formalism to study the dissipative spin-boson model with Ohmic dissipation. Our results are compared against numerical simulations based on the Quantum Monte Carlo Wavefunction method. \nI. INTRODUCTORY REMARK\nThe understanding of how macroscopic objects behave under the influence of their environments has been a central issue in physics since its very beginning [1, 2] . This problem becomes particularly challenging when dealing with complex many-body systems such as condensed matter or biological ones [3, 4] , where the number of degrees of freedom involved can be extremely large. A powerful theoretical tool to tackle these problems consists in studying the dynamics of the reduced state of the system of interest S conditioned upon some specific measurement performed over the environmental degrees of freedom E [5, 6] .\nIn recent years there have been several attempts to develop efficient methods to describe the time-evolution of the reduced state [7, 8] . Among them, the so-called Hierarchy of Density Matrices (HDM) [9] represents a promising alternative to other approaches [10, 11] due to its ability to capture non-Markovian effects [12] . However, despite being able to provide accurate predictions for short-time evolutions [13] , the HDM fails to reproduce correctly the asymptotic behavior of the system [14] .

{"text":"We study nonlinear development of the r-mode instability in accreting neutron stars using numerical simulations with realistic equations of state and nuclear composition. We find that the growth rate of unstable modes is reduced by several orders of magnitude compared to previous results obtained for polytropic models, but still remains much higher than the viscous damping rates inferred from observations. The saturation amplitude of unstable modes depends on their frequency as well as on the equation of state used in our calculations.  For low-frequency modes (with frequencies below about 100 Hz) we obtain amplitudes which are consistent with those observed in SAX J1808.4-3658. However, for high-frequency modes (frequencies above 300 Hz), the predicted amplitudes exceed observational limits by more than an order of magnitude. This discrepancy may be resolved if additional dissipation mechanisms such as gravitational radiation reaction or magnetic field generation play important role during the evolution of unstable modes."}

In this work we study the problem of finding optimal strategies for both the seller and buyer in such an auction setting with multiple items and multiple buyers.   We show how to find the optimal strategy for the seller using linear programming techniques and provide bounds on the number of measurements required to determine the winner's identity.   For the case of two buyers competing for three items, our results imply that the seller should always announce one item as the winner at each round until only one buyer remains.   ... Quantum mechanics has been used to develop new types of auctions which allow sellers to make better decisions about what goods they want to sell and buyers to make better decisions about which goods they wish to purchase. These auctions have been shown to be useful even if all parties involved do not trust each other completely."}

{"text":"We report the detection of absorption by silicates with an optical depth of 0.1 at 9.7 microns toward the quasar HE 0515-4414 (z = 0.52) using data obtained with ISO-SWS and LWS on board ISO. The silicate feature is detected only when we use the full resolution spectrum, which shows that it has been smoothed out due to blending with other features in lower-resolution spectra. We find no evidence for dust emission associated with this absorber. This result suggests that the absorbing material consists mainly of cold gas rather than warm dust. If so, then the mass of cool gas required to produce such strong absorption lines would be much larger than expected based on current models of galaxy formation. In addition, if the observed absorption arises solely from cold gas, then the implied covering factor of the absorber must be very large compared to what is seen in local galaxies."}

It was discovered by William Herschel during his famous survey of the southern sky [1] . Its distance has been estimated using several methods [2] , giving values ranging between 8 kpc [3] and 12 kpc [4] . These estimates are consistent within their errors but they do not agree with those derived from the analysis of its red giant branch [5] which suggest a larger value of about 16 kpc [6] .\n \nThe first detailed study of the cluster was performed by Trumpler [7] who found it to have a core radius of 3 arcmin and a half-mass relaxation time of 4 Gyrs. Later studies [8] confirmed these results. More recently [9] determined the structural parameters of the cluster finding a core radius of 5.3 arcmin and a concentration parameter c = log(r t \/r c ) = 0.6 \u00b1 0.1 where r t is the tidal radius and r c is the core radius. They also found evidence of mass segregation among the brightest stars. \nNGC 5466 shows a bimodal colour distribution [10] as well as a double peaked radial profile [11] .

{"text":"We study vortex matter in honeycomb (HC) and kagome (KC) pinning arrays by using the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation with periodic boundary conditions, which is solved numerically on square lattices with sizes up to L = 256. We find that HC and KC have different effects on vortex dynamics depending on their density n. For low densities, vortices are pinned at individual defects for both HC and KC; however, they form ordered structures only in HC but not in KC. At high densities, we observe two distinct phases in HC; one is a vortex molecular crystal state where all vortices occupy single sites, while another phase has a vortex plastic crystal structure where some vortices remain unpinned. In contrast, no such ordered states exist in KC even at very large defect densities. Our results suggest that the difference between HC and KC originates from the fact that the former can support more than one vortex per site whereas the latter cannot."}

In this talk I will present some recent results on planet formation around single and double stars that we have obtained with our SPH simulations.

The total number of terrestrial planets formed also increases significantly if there is another star nearby. Finally, we show that the orbital properties of these planets depend crucially on their mutual gravitational interactions during growth.

{"text":"We consider universal source coding with respect to monotonic distributions, which are defined as the set of all probability mass functions that can be obtained by shifting an initial distribution on some finite alphabet. We show that any such distribution is uniquely characterized by its entropy rate (or equivalently, its Shannon capacity). This allows us to derive optimal codes in terms of redundancy bounds. In particular, we prove that there exists a code whose redundancy vanishes asymptotically at the same speed as the best possible one among all codes using a given number of bits per symbol. Finally, we provide explicit constructions of these codes based on arithmetic progressions. The results presented here generalize those known so far only for memoryless sources or geometrically decaying distributions. They also extend previous work on universal compression of data streams generated by stationary ergodic processes. \nIntroduction\n\nIn this paper, we study universal source coding problems related to monotonic distributions. These distributions have been introduced recently in [1] , where it was shown how they arise naturally when considering universal compression of data streams produced by stationary ergodic processes. More precisely, let $(X_n)_{n\\geq 1}$ denote a sequence of iid random variables taking values in $\\{0,1\\}^d$ according to some unknown pmf $P_0$. Then, the pmfs $P_n$ induced by shifts of $P_0$ along the sequence $(X_1,\\ldots, X_n)$ form what has been called a monotonic family of distributions. It turns out that the problem of finding good universal codes for this class of distributions reduces to studying the case of monotonic distributions over binary alphabets. Indeed, if $(X_n)_n$ denotes a sequence of iid Bernoulli random variables distributed according to some unknown pmfp $P_0$, then the pmfs $P_n$ associated with shifted versions of $P_0$ along the first $n$ symbols of the sequence satisfy $P_n=P_0\\oplus P_{n-1} \\oplus \\cdots \\oplus P_{1-n}$, where $+$ stands for addition modulo 2. Thus, the pmfs $P_i$ belong to the same monotonic family of distributions"}
{"text":"We study the ground state properties of fermions interacting via attractive four-fermion interactions in two, three and four dimensions (2D, 3D and 4D). We show that for any dimension d > 1 there is always an energy gap between the lowest lying excitations and the ground state which implies that these systems are gapped insulators. In 2D we find that the system has a finite density of states at zero energy leading to a metallic phase with power law decaying correlations. The existence of this metallic phase can be understood by mapping our model onto a free fermionic theory using bosonization techniques. For 3D and 4D we argue that the system is either a Mott insulator or a charge density wave insulator depending on whether the Fermi surface encloses one or more than one electron per unit cell respectively. Finally we discuss how our results may be relevant to recent experiments studying strongly correlated materials such as high temperature superconductors. \n \n Introduction \n \n Strongly correlated electronic systems have been studied extensively over many years both theoretically and experimentally [1] . One of the most interesting phenomena observed in these systems is the formation of ordered phases where electrons localize into spatially separated regions known as \"Cooper pairs\" [2] , \"Mott insulating\" [3] or \"Wigner crystal\" [4] phases. These phases occur when the kinetic energy of the electrons cannot overcome their mutual Coulomb repulsion resulting in a suppression of the single particle spectral weight near the chemical potential [5] .\n \nIn order to understand the physics behind these exotic phases it is important to develop theoretical tools capable of describing them accurately [6] . A powerful technique used to describe these types of problems is the so-called \"bosonization method\" [7, 8] . This approach maps the original problem involving fermions to another problem involving bosons thereby allowing us to use standard methods developed for bosonic theories [9] . However, despite its successes, the bosonization method suffers from some drawbacks [10] . Firstly, it only works well if the number of fermions N is large compared to the correlation length \u03be [11] . Secondly, even though the bosonized description"}

{"text":"We study the effect of electron-electron interactions (EEI) on the spin-flip rate due to phonons in semiconductor quantum dots. We show that EEI leads to an enhancement of this rate by several orders of magnitude, which is explained by the formation of collective excitations known as plasmons.

In particular, semiconductor quantum dots have been proposed as promising candidates for these purposes [2] , since they allow one to confine charge carriers within small volumes with high precision [3] .\nIn order to use quantum dots for spin manipulation, however, we need to understand how their spin states evolve under different conditions. This requires knowledge about the mechanisms governing spin relaxation processes [4] . One important mechanism is provided by phonons [5] : when confined charges move through the lattice potential of the crystal, they generate strain fields [6] . These strains induce local deformations of the lattice structure [7, 8] , resulting in the emission of phonons [9] . Since phonons carry angular momentum [10] , they may flip the spin state of the confined carrier [11] . However, the strength of this process depends strongly on the details of the confinement potential [12] . For example, if the confining potential is parabolic [13] , then the spin-flip rate induced by phonons scales linearly with temperature [14] . On the other hand, if the confining"}

{"text":"We present an approach to dependability analysis that is hierarchical in nature, and can be applied to any cache-based storage architecture.

Our results demonstrate that this approach provides significant advantages over traditional approaches based solely on analytical modeling or simulation experiments. In particular, we find that: (1) it allows us to obtain accurate estimates of reliability measures such as mean time between failures; (2) it enables us to explore tradeoffs among various design parameters; and (3) it helps us identify critical components within the system. Finally, we discuss some limitations of our approach and suggest directions for future research.

{"text":"The present study investigates how research performance is distributed across Europe by analyzing bibliometrics data for the top-100 most productive universities in terms of publications and citations, as well as their respective fields of research. We find that the distribution of productivity follows Zipf's law with an exponent close to 1 (i.e., power-law behavior), which implies that there are few highly productive institutions and many less productive ones. The same holds true when we consider citation impact instead of raw publication counts. In addition, we show that the number of papers published per university increases superlinearly with its size, while the average number of citations received decreases sublinearly. These results suggest that larger universities tend to publish more but receive fewer citations on average than smaller ones do. Finally, we investigate whether these findings hold true at different levels of aggregation within our sample. Our analysis reveals that the observed patterns are robust against changes in the definition of what constitutes a university or field of research."}
{"text":"We present new observations and analysis of two nearby supernova remnants, G292.0+1.8 (Cas A) and Kes 79. We find that both remnants show significant asymmetry between their northern and southern halves; however, we argue that this is not due to an asymmetric explosion but rather to differences in the ambient medium into which each half was expanding at the time of its formation.  In Cas A, we observe a large difference in the density structure along the line-of-sight towards the north and south sides of the remnant. The northern side shows evidence for a dense shell-like feature while the southern side appears more uniform with no clear indication of such a shell. This suggests that the progenitor star exploded through a denser region on the northern side than it did on the southern side.   For Kes 79, our X-ray data reveal a bright compact source located near the center of the remnant's southern half. We suggest that this object may be associated with the central engine of the supernova event or possibly even the neutron star itself."}

The amplitude of this signal is consistent with theoretical predictions based on the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect. This result suggests that the cold spot may be due to a superposition of many unresolved SZ clusters along our line-of-sight.

The fraction is higher than previous studies because we use much deeper data to detect faint structures. In addition, we identify star forming regions along the tails by measuring their UV-optical colors. About one third of our sample shows strong star formation activity at least 1 kpc away from the galaxy centers. These star bursting regions are found only in systems where both components have similar masses within a factor of 3. This suggests that these interactions trigger star formation over large scales.

{"text":"We propose an alternative switching mechanism for spintronic devices based on domain walls (DWs). The proposed device consists of two ferromagnetic layers separated by a non-magnetic spacer layer, where DWs can be driven between different positions in each magnetic layer using spin-orbit torques and electric fields. We show that this new type of device is able to operate at lower current densities than conventional spin valves with comparable magnetoresistance values. In addition we demonstrate how the energy barrier associated with the motion of the DWs can be tuned through changes in the thicknesses of both the ferromagnets and the non-magnetic spacer. This allows us to optimize the energy landscape such that the DWs are trapped in their equilibrium position when no external field or voltage bias is applied. Finally, we discuss possible applications of our proposal as well as its limitations. Spintronics has emerged over recent years as one of the most promising technologies for future information processing systems [1] . One of the main challenges faced by these devices is the development of efficient ways to control the flow of charge carriers without compromising their high mobility [2] .\nIn order to overcome this problem several groups have recently investigated the possibility of controlling the direction of electron transport via the manipulation of magnetic textures [3] , which include vortex states [4] , skyrmions [5] and domain walls [6] . Domain walls are particularly interesting since they can be manipulated electrically [7, 8] and thermally [9] , making them ideal candidates for low-power consumption devices [10] .

{"text":"We study the effect of interactions on the transport properties of double quantum dot systems with Rashba spin-orbit coupling using numerical renormalization group (NRG) calculations. We find that the system undergoes a transition to an interacting topological phase as we increase the strength of the interaction. The critical value of the interaction at which this occurs is found to be strongly dependent upon the level spacing statistics of the underlying single-particle spectrum. In particular, it decreases rapidly when the distribution becomes more localized around zero energy. This behavior can be understood by considering how the density of states evolves under RG flow.

INTRODUCTORY REMARkS\nThe recent discovery of Majorana fermions has led to renewed interest in studying non-abelian anyons in condensed matter physics [1] . One promising candidate for realizing such exotic particles is provided by semiconductor nanowires [2] , where they may appear as end modes of the wire [3] or as excitations bound to vortex cores [4] .\nIn order to realize these proposals experimentally, one must first understand the effects of disorder [5] , electron-electron interactions [6] , and other sources of decoherence [7, 8] on the stability of the Majorana edge state [9] . A number of theoretical studies have been carried out recently [10] - [42] addressing some aspects of these issues. However, many open questions remain regarding the interplay among various physical mechanisms responsible for the appearance of Majoranas in realistic experimental setups.\nOne important issue concerns the role played by interactions in determining the nature of the ground state of the system. It was shown previously that repulsive interactions tend to favor the formation of a spin-singlet state over a triplet state [43] . On the other hand, attractive interactions lead to the opposite situation, i.e., the formation of a spin-triplet state instead of a singlet state [44] . These results were obtained"}

We prove that if f is such a form and g is another form with coefficients in an imaginary quadratic field K then the difference between the one-level densities of f and g vanishes to all orders at s = 1\/2 when f has trivial central character or when it does not have any non-trivial zeros off the critical line. In particular this implies that the first moment of the family of forms corresponding to f agrees with the first moment of the Hecke-Maa\u00df series attached to f . This generalizes results by Iwaniec and Sarnak who proved these statements under additional hypotheses on the weight function w used in their definition of the one-level density.

{"text":"We present an explicit formula for the coefficients in the expansion of certain Eisenstein series into Dirichlet characters, and use it to prove that the ratios conjecture is true at all primes p with $(p-1)\/2$ odd.

The Langlands program predicts that there should be deep connections between number theory and representation theory.

{"text":"We study the dependence of galaxy isophotal structure parameters, such as the Sersic index n, effective radius Re, axis ratio q, position angle PA, and surface brightness SB, on environment (local density) and nuclear activity (AGN luminosity). We use a sample of early-type galaxies selected by their colors from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 6 (SDSS DR6), which contains about 1 million objects with spectroscopic redshifts between 0 < z < 0.3. The local density around each galaxy was estimated using its nearest neighbors within a projected distance rp = 20h-1 Mpc and a velocity difference |v| = 1000 km s-1. For our analysis we used only those galaxies that have no nearby companions brighter than them by more than one magnitude to avoid any possible contamination due to tidal interactions or mergers. \n \n In order to investigate how these structural properties depend on environment and nuclear activity, we divided our sample into four different subsamples based on the values of local density and AGN luminosity: low-density\/low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGNs), high-density\/high-luminosity active Galactic Nuclei (HLAGNs), low-density\/high-luminous inactive galaxies (LHIGGs), and high-density\/low-luminous inactive galaxies(HLIGGs). \n \n Our results show that LLAGNs are generally rounder and less concentrated compared to HLAGNs. This suggests that LLAGNs may be undergoing morphological transformations driven by environmental effects and\/or internal processes associated with black hole growth. On average, LHIGGs appear to be rounder but slightly less concentrated than HLIGGs. However, there appears to be an overlap among all four samples for most of the structural parameters considered here."}
{"text":"We present an analysis of the evolution of early-type galaxies (ETGs) in hydrodynamical cosmological simulations, focusing on their formation history as well as their internal structure at z = 0. We find that ETG progenitors are typically gas-rich systems with high star formation rates (SFRs), which evolve into red-sequence objects through dry mergers. In addition to this major merger channel for forming ETGs, we show that minor mergers can also contribute significantly to the growth of massive ETGs by bringing in fresh cold gas. Our results suggest that both processes play important roles in shaping the observed properties of local ETGs. This is consistent with recent observational studies showing that most massive ETGs have experienced multiple episodes of merging over cosmic time. \n \n Keywords: galaxy evolution, galaxy morphology, galaxy scaling relations, galaxy clusters, semi-analytic models, hydrodynamics, dark matter"}
{"text":"We study quantum spin-1\/2 systems with spatially anisotropic exchange interactions on the distorted kagome lattice, which is relevant for volborthite. We show that this system can be mapped onto an effective Heisenberg model in terms of classical spins residing at the centers of hexagons formed by nearest-neighbor bonds. The ground state phase diagram consists of three phases: ferromagnetic (FM), antiferromagnetic (AFM) and canted AFM states. In particular, we find that the FM order survives even when the distortion is strong enough to destroy it completely without spatial anisotropy. This result suggests that the magnetic properties of volborthite are governed not only by the interlayer coupling but also by the intralayer one. Furthermore, we discuss possible origins of the observed magnetization plateau in volborthite. \nI. INTRODUCTIO N\nThe distorted kagome lattice has attracted much attention recently because its structure is realized in several materials such as volborthite [1] , kapellasite [2] , herbertsmithite [3] , vesignieite [4] . These compounds have been studied extensively both experimentally [5] - [8] and theoretically [9] - [11] .\nIn particular, volborthite shows rich physical phenomena including a magnetization plateau around 1\/3 of saturation magnetization M s [12]- [14] . It was suggested that these features originate from the presence of the distorted kagome layers [15] . However, there still remain many open questions about the microscopic mechanism behind them [16] . For example, what kind of interaction plays a crucial role? Is the distortion necessary or not?\nTo answer these questions, it would be useful to investigate the effect of the distortion systematically using theoretical methods [17] . Although some studies have already been done [18] - [20] , they were limited to small clusters and\/or weak distortion cases. Therefore, it remains unclear how the distortion affects the magnetic properties of the distorted kagom\u00e9 layer.\nIn this work, we study quantum spin-1\/2 models with spatially anisotropic exchanges on the distorted kagom\u00e9 lattice [see Figs. 1("}
{"text":"We have analyzed nine years (1991\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1998) of data on blazars observed by the Energetic Gamma Ray Experiment Telescope (EGRET). We find that there is no significant correlation between gamma-ray flux and photon index for individual sources, but we do see evidence for an anti-correlation when all sources are combined into one sample. This result suggests that the spectrum hardens as the source brightens. The lack of such a trend in single-source analysis may be due to insufficient statistics or intrinsic spectral variability within each source. Our results also suggest that the average luminosity of blazars increases faster than linearly with increasing redshift. These findings can help us understand how relativistic jets work in active galactic nuclei. Relativistic jets play important roles in many astrophysical phenomena including active galactic nuclei (AGNs), microquasars, pulsar winds, and gamma ray bursts (GRBs). In AGNs, they are believed to carry away most of the energy produced at the central engine. However, it remains unclear what physical processes drive these energetic outflows."}
{"text":"We present the results obtained by applying the semi-analytic code VESPA to model the evolution of galaxies in the Millennium Simulation, including chemical enrichment as well as dust extinction effects on their observed properties.  We show that our models reproduce many observational trends for different types of galaxies at z=0 (e.g., luminosity functions), but also predict some new ones which can be tested with future surveys such as Euclid or LSST. In particular we find that:  - The predicted number density of massive quiescent galaxies is too high compared to observations; this problem could be alleviated if AGN feedback were more efficient than assumed here. - Our predictions are consistent with current estimates of the cosmic SFRD out to redshifts of about 4.5, although they tend to overpredict it slightly beyond that redshift. - At low masses (Mstar < 10^10 Msun) there appears to be an excess of blue galaxies relative to red galaxies in both the real Universe and in our simulations. This may indicate that either our treatment of supernova feedback and\/or reionization physics needs improvement, or else that these processes have been affected by baryonic effects not included in our simulation."}
{"text":"We present results on searches for gravitational wave (GW) burst signals using data collected by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory during its fourth science run, which took place between September 2005 and January 2007.

The latter is used as part of a blind analysis where we do not know what type or strength of signal may be present in our data until after it has been analyzed. In addition to these analyses, we also perform several consistency checks designed to identify any problems associated with either detector's performance over this period.

{"text":"We present an efficient method for simulating the formation of large-scale structure in the early universe, including reionization by stars and quasars.

The results are compared against observations of high-redshift galaxies obtained using the Hubble Space Telescope. This work was supported by NASA grant NNX08AG84G.

In addition, we find evidence for a third dust lane oriented perpendicularly to these two features which may be associated with a nuclear bar. Our ALMA data show that the distribution of dense molecular gas traced by HCN(1-0), HCO+(1-0), and CS(2-1) emission lines exhibits a ring-like structure around the AGN.

Mass is transferred through the inner Lagrangian point L1 onto the surface of the white dwarf where it forms an accretion disk surrounding the compact object. This process leads to periodic outbursts caused by thermal instabilities in the accretion disk resulting in dramatic changes in luminosity over time scales ranging from hours up to years [1] . During these outbursts, the accretion rate increases by several orders of magnitude leading to strong winds and high temperatures in the disk [2] , while the system becomes fainter than usual due to obscuration effects [3] .\n \nThe study of CVs provides valuable information about the physical processes involved in accretion flows [4] , magnetic fields [5] , and angular momentum transport [6] .

There have now been more than 300 confirmed exo-planets discovered orbiting distant stars through various techniques including radial velocity measurements, photometric transits, direct imaging, and microlensing events [1] . However, all but two of these planets were found around relatively bright host stars (V < 12). These planets are typically massive gas giants with short periods of days to weeks [2] , making them difficult targets for detailed studies aimed at understanding the physical conditions necessary for life. For example, only three of these planets have measured masses: HD 209458b [3] , GJ 436b [4] , and OGLE-TR-561b [5] .

{"text":"We consider the problem of designing distributed consensus algorithms in sensor networks where links are randomly generated and can be lost or added over time. We propose an algorithm that is robust to link failures, but requires only local information exchange between neighboring nodes. The proposed algorithm achieves global convergence under mild conditions on network topology. In particular, we show that if each node has at least one neighbor whose degree is greater than its own then our algorithm converges almost surely (a.s.) to the correct value. Our results also hold when there exists a small number of Byzantine nodes which may deviate arbitrarily from their prescribed behavior. Finally, numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Keywords: Sensor Networks; Distributed Consensus; Local Information Exchange; Robustness Analysis. 1 Introduction Distributed consensus problems arise naturally in many applications such as flocking [1] , formation control [2] , multi-agent coordination [3] , wireless sensor networks [4] , etc.. A typical example is the average-consensus problem: given a set of n agents connected by communication links, each agent holds some initial data xi(0) \u2208 Rm, i = 1, ..., n; it aims to compute the average x\u0304=1\/n\u2211in=1xi(0). This problem was first studied by Tsitsiklis et al. [5] . They showed that if all agents have access to the same fixed directed graph G, then the average-consensus problem can be solved using a simple linear iterative scheme. However, this assumption does not always hold true since the underlying communication graphs are often random due to unreliable links [6] .\nIn recent years, several researchers have investigated the design of distributed consensus algorithms in dynamic networks [7-10]. For instance, Olfati-Saber [7] considered the case where the communication links among agents change randomly according to independent Bernoulli processes. Under certain assumptions on the connectivity of the network, she proved that her algorithm converges almost surely (i.e., with probability one) to the desired average. Subsequently, Jadbabaie et al. [8] extended these results to undirected networks. More recently,"}

The data were obtained during an active state of the source on February 18-20, 2005 . We find that the spectral energy distribution is consistent with synchrotron self-Compton emission from relativistic electrons accelerated by magnetic reconnection events occurring within the jet. This interpretation is supported by the detection of rapid variability at all wavelengths observed simultaneously. In addition to this flaring activity we also detect significant flux variations over longer timescales which are likely due to changes in the Doppler boosting factor caused by bulk motion of plasma along the jet.

{"text":"The gravitational lensing effect was first predicted by Einstein in 1915, but it took another 50 years before the first confirmed observation could be made.  In this talk I will describe how one particular event - Nova Geminorum 1912 - played an important role in motivating Einstein to develop his theory of general relativity.   The talk is based on my recent book \"The First Lensing Event\" (Cambridge University Press). \n\nGravitational lensing occurs when light passes close to a massive object such as a galaxy or cluster of galaxies.  This causes the light rays to bend towards each other so that distant objects appear magnified and distorted.  \n\nIn 1919, Einstein published his famous field equations which described gravity as curvature in space-time caused by matter\/energy.  These equations were able to explain many phenomena including the perihelion precession of Mercury's orbit around the Sun. \n\nHowever, there remained some puzzles about these equations.  For example, they did not predict any bending of light passing near the Sun.\n\nEinstein realised he needed to modify his original field equations if he wanted them to account for gravitational lensing effects.  He introduced what we now call the cosmological constant into his new set of equations.  However, despite considerable effort over several decades, no-one has been able to measure the value of this constant with sufficient accuracy to test whether Einstein's prediction is correct.  \n\nThis talk describes how astronomers finally managed to observe gravitational lensing in 1979 using observations of a distant quasar known as Q0957+561A-B.

{"text":"We present an analysis on how to select target events for planetary microlensing follow-up observations, based on our experience with PLANETS project. We find that there are three criteria which should be considered when selecting targets for follow up observation; (1) The event duration, (2) The lens mass and distance, and (3) The planet detection efficiency. In addition we also discuss other factors such as weather condition at the time of the event peak, and the possibility of detecting planets around brown dwarfs. Finally, we give some suggestions about future projects. Keywords: Microlensing; Planets; Brown Dwarfs; Follow-up Observations. 1 Introduction Microlensing is one of the most promising methods to detect extrasolar planets because it can provide information not only on the existence but also on physical properties of planets without any biases against their orbital parameters or host star types. However, since the Einstein ring radius of a lensing object is typically much smaller than its angular size, it takes several years to monitor thousands of stars continuously by using ground-based telescopes. Therefore, many groups have been conducting intensive monitoring programs toward Galactic bulge fields during the last decade. As a result, more than 100 exoplanet candidates were discovered so far through this method [1] . Among them, however, only four planets have been confirmed by radial velocity measurements [2] .\nMicrolensing events occur due to gravitational lensing effect between two objects separated by large distances. When a background source passes close enough to a foreground lensing object, the light rays coming from the source will bend towards the lensing object. This causes magnification of the source flux. If a planet exists near the lensing object, additional perturbation occurs in the lensing light curve. Since the amount of the perturbation depends strongly on the projected separation between the lensing object and the planet, the presence of a planet can be detected by analyzing the shape of the lensing light curve [3, 4] ."}
{"text":"We present the first global 3D MHD simulations of magnetized accretion disks with self-consistent radiative transfer and dust evolution, including both gas-phase and grain-surface chemistry. We find that magnetic fields can significantly affect disk structure by suppressing turbulence and reducing angular momentum transport across scales ranging from the local to the global scale. The resulting reduction in turbulent viscosity leads to lower mass accretion rates onto the central star compared to non-magnetic models. In addition, we show that magnetic fields have important effects on chemical abundances through their influence on mixing processes. Our results suggest that magnetic fields may be responsible for some observed trends between chemical composition and stellar age. \n \n Keywords: Accretion Disk, Magnetic Field, Turbulence, Self-Gravity, Radiation Transfer, Dust Evolution, Chemistry \n \n Protostellar disks are believed to play an essential role in planet formation. However, our understanding of how these disks evolve is limited because they cannot yet be directly imaged at high spatial resolution due to their large distances (typically tens or hundreds of parsecs). Instead, observations must rely on indirect methods such as infrared spectroscopy which provide information about the physical conditions within the disk but not its detailed geometry. To better understand this process it is necessary to develop theoretical models capable of reproducing observational data while simultaneously making predictions that can then be tested observationally. This requires numerical simulations that include all relevant physics - namely hydrodynamics, radiation transfer, self-gravity, dust growth\/fragmentation\/destruction, and non-equilibrium chemistry."}

We performed two sets of pointed RXTE observations to study this behavior further. In both cases we found that the pulse frequency decreases smoothly during our observation runs. This trend can be described well using an exponential decay model for which we find characteristic timescales of 1.1 days and 0.7 days respectively. These values are consistent with those reported previously based on Chandra data alone. However, when comparing these results directly it should be noted that the uncertainties associated with the previous measurements were significantly larger due to the lower signal-to-noise ratio achieved with Chandra compared to RXTE."}

The lensing galaxy is located between two images A and C separated by 2.7 arcsec. We detected three compact continuum sources associated with each image component. In addition we found several faint emission lines including CO(3-2), 13CO(3-2), HCN(4-3), CS(5-4), SiO(8-7). From these results we conclude that there are four components contributing to the total flux density; one for each image plus an additional component due to the lensing galaxy.

We show that these data can be used to discriminate between various scenarios of cosmic ray origin and propagation. In particular we find that:  - The observed anisotropies are consistent with predictions based on conventional astrophysical acceleration mechanisms only if one assumes very hard injection spectra at source (with spectral index below -2). This is inconsistent with observations of other messengers such as gamma-rays or radio waves.  - If one allows for more exotic particle physics processes like decaying dark matter particles then it becomes possible to explain both the observed anisotropies and the spectrum of cosmic rays without violating any observational constraints. However this scenario requires fine-tuning of parameters which makes it less appealing than conventional astrophysics explanations."}

INTRODUCTORY REMARK .\nDark Matter (DM) is one of the most important mysteries of modern physics [1] - [4] . Its presence has been established only indirectly through its gravitational influence on visible stars [5] , galaxies [6] , clusters [7] etc., but direct detection experiments have so far failed [8] - [10] . There exist many theoretical models describing DM [11] - [13] ; however, none of them has yet been confirmed experimentally [14] . One of the possibilities is that DM consists of new elementary particles [15] - [17] . If they interact weakly or electromagnetically with ordinary matter then they would escape detection even if they were produced in large quantities [18] . On the other hand, if they interact strongly enough with normal matter, then they may be detectable directly [19] - [21] . A number of experiments searching for DM particles have been carried out [22] - [26] . Recently, the results obtained by the DAMA collaboration [27] attracted considerable attention [28] - [30] . According to these results, the annual modulation effect [31] - [33] caused by the motion of Earth around Sun [34] - [36] leads to an increase in the rate of nuclear recoils registered by detectors during June-October period [37] compared to December-February period. Such behavior cannot be explained within Standard Model of particle interactions [38] - [41] . Several authors suggested different explanations based on"}
{"text":"We propose that the Standard Model (SM) is completed by adding new particles and interactions, which are predicted to appear in many different contexts within String Theory. In particular we consider the possibility that there exists an additional U(1) gauge symmetry associated with a hidden sector containing light states charged under this group. We show how such a scenario can be realised using Type IIB orientifolds compactified on Calabi-Yau three-folds. The resulting model contains two sectors connected via gravitational interactions mediated by Kaluza-Klein modes. One of these sectors consists of SM fields while the other one includes exotic states charged under both the SM and the hidden U(1). These states have masses below 1 TeV and couple very weakly to ordinary matter. This leads to interesting signatures for collider experiments as well as possible effects in precision measurements. Finally, we discuss some cosmological implications of our proposal."}
{"text":"We present new near-infrared observations of the star forming region S255N, which is part of the larger Orion B molecular cloud complex at a distance of about 1 kpc (\u223c3200 ly). We find that this region contains several thousand young stars with masses between 0.1 and 10 M\u2299 distributed over an area of about 20 pc \u00d7 30 pc. The majority of these are found within two clusters separated by about 5 pc along the line-of-sight. These clusters have ages of less than 3 Myr as determined from their H-R diagram positions. Using Monte Carlo simulations we show that it is unlikely to form such large number of massive stars in such small volume purely due to chance superposition of individual stellar groups. Instead, our results suggest that there may be one or more protoclusters associated with this region. This would imply that the formation process of massive stars can occur on scales much smaller than previously thought."}
{"text":"We report the first ultrafast electron nanocrystallographic study on size-selected gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). The AuNPs were prepared in solution and deposited onto carbon-coated copper grids for transmission electron microscopy studies. Time-resolved pump-probe experiments with femtosecond resolution were performed at beamline U41-PGM, MAX IV Laboratory, Sweden. We observed that the lattice expansion is anisotropic along different crystallographic directions within individual particles. This observation can be explained by considering the effect of surface stress induced during particle growth. In addition to this, we found that the lattice expansion depends strongly on the nanoparticle sizes. These results are important for understanding how the properties of nanoparticles evolve as their dimensions decrease towards atomic scale. A new technique has been developed recently which allows one to probe structural dynamics of materials down to the atomic level using ultrashort X-ray pulses [1] . However, it remains challenging to perform time-resolved measurements on single crystals or nanoparticles due to difficulties associated with sample preparation [2] , data collection [3] , and analysis [4] .\nIn order to overcome these challenges, researchers have started exploring alternative techniques such as ultrafast electron nanocrystalography [5] - [8] . In this method, an intense femtosecond laser pulse is used to excite electrons into unoccupied states above Fermi energy E F . Subsequently, photoelectrons emitted from excited atoms travel through the crystal and scatter off neighboring atoms [9] . By measuring the angular distribution of scattered photoelectrons, information about the structure of the material under investigation can be obtained [10] . Since the scattering cross section increases rapidly when photoelectrons approach the Brillouin zone boundary [11] , the photoelectron diffraction pattern contains more Bragg peaks than conventional powder patterns [12] . Therefore, the photoelectron diffraction pattern provides higher spatial resolution compared to traditional powder methods [13] ."}

{"text":"We present the results for two different models of galaxy formation, one stable model with no dark matter halos merging or growing in mass (the standard CDM scenario), and an unstable model where dark matter halos merge continuously to form larger structures.  We use these models to study how galaxies evolve over time as they are affected by mergers between their host dark matter halos.   The merger rate is higher at earlier times when there were more small halos available to merge into large ones.  In our unstable model we find that most massive galaxies have experienced several major mergers since z = 1 while less massive galaxies have had fewer mergers.    Our results show that the number density of brightest cluster galaxies has increased dramatically since z=1 due to mergers between clusters of galaxies.  This increase can be explained if brightest cluster galaxies grow through mergers rather than simply forming out of gas cooling within the hot intracluster medium."}
{"text":"We present the results of our study on the phenomenology of spin excitations in high-Tc superconductors based on lanthanum (La) or yttrium (Y). We show that the observed magnetic response can be described by two distinct contributions, one coming from the low-energy collective modes with an energy scale of about 10 meV and another one originating from high-energy incoherent fluctuations at energies up to 100-200 meV. The latter contribution is found to dominate over the former for temperatures above T* ~ 150 K. In addition we find that the temperature dependence of the intensity of these fluctuations follows closely the behavior expected for fermionic quasiparticles. Finally, we discuss how this picture compares with other experimental findings as well as theoretical predictions. \n \n High-temperature superconductivity has been discovered more than twenty years ago [1-3] but its microscopic origin remains unknown. One of the most important open questions concerns the nature of elementary excitations responsible for pairing [4] . A number of experiments have shown that the normal state properties are dominated by strong electronic correlations which lead to a variety of interesting phenomena such as pseudogap [5-7] , non-Fermi liquid [8] , charge density wave [9] , stripe formation [10] etc.. These effects are believed to play also an essential role in determining the physical properties of the superconducting phase [11] .\nIn recent years there has been considerable progress in understanding the physics of strongly correlated systems using angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) [12] . This technique allows direct access to the single-particle spectral function A(k,\u03c9), where k denotes momentum and \u03c9 frequency. ARPES studies revealed several remarkable features of the electronic structure of hightemperature superconductors: Fermi surface reconstruction [13] , presence of flat bands [14] , van Hove singularities [15] , d-wave symmetry of the order parameter [16] , existence of nodal [17] and antinodal [18] regions, and so forth. However, despite all efforts made during last decade it still seems impossible to explain many aspects of the data within any existing theoretical framework [19] ."}
{"text":"We report the first experimental observation of environmental dielectric screening (EDS) effects on optical transitions between different electronic states in individual semiconducting single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). We show that EDS can be used to tune the emission energy and linewidths of SWCNT photoluminescence, which is important for applications such as optoelectronic devices based on these materials. \n \n The observed changes are explained by considering how the local environment affects the electron-hole interaction strength through its influence on the dielectric constant at the position of each tube. This work provides new insights into the fundamental physics governing the properties of carbon nanotube-based systems. Carbon nanotubes have attracted considerable attention because they exhibit unique physical characteristics [1] . In particular, their one-dimensional structure leads to interesting phenomena not found in bulk or two-dimensional materials [2] , including quantum confinement [3] , ballistic transport [4] , and strong light-matter interactions [5] .\nIn addition, recent advances in chemical synthesis techniques [6] allow us to produce high-quality samples with controlled chiralities [7, 8] . These developments make it possible to study the intrinsic properties of carbon nanotubes without being affected by extrinsic factors [9] . However, despite this progress, there remain many open questions about the basic physics underlying carbon nanotube behavior [10] . For example, although theoretical studies predict that the band gap should depend strongly on the diameter [11] , experiments have shown only weak correlations [12] . One reason may be that the actual diameters of synthesized tubes often differ significantly from those predicted theoretically [13] . Another possibility is that the surrounding medium plays an important role [14] . Indeed, previous works have demonstrated that the presence of surfactants [15] , solvent molecules [16] , and water [17] can affect the optical properties of carbon nanotubes [18] ."}
{"text":"We consider the on-line version of the following problem: given an undirected graph G = (V, E) and two nodes s and t in V , find a simple path between them that minimizes its length. The algorithm is allowed to query only one edge at each step; if it chooses e \u2208 E then it knows whether or not there exists another edge f such that d(s, f ) + d(f, t) < d(s, e) + d(e, t). We show how this information can be used by our algorithm to obtain better results than those obtained with algorithms for the standard on-line shortest path problem. In particular we prove that: \nIntroduction\n\nThe on-line shortest path problem was introduced independently by Karp et al. ([2]), Papadimitriou & Tsitsiklis ([3])\nand Christofides et al. ([1]) . It consists of finding a minimum-length path connecting two specified vertices in a directed or undirected graph while knowing only distances from these two points to other vertices. \nIn the classical setting, the input data are presented all together before any queries are made. On-line problems arise when some parts of the input become available gradually over time. For example, in many applications involving network routing, the cost matrix may change as new links are added or removed. Another important application area is computational geometry where on-line problems appear naturally in connection with dynamic point location and range searching problems."}
{"text":"The low-energy parameters of neutron-proton scattering are determined by using modern experimental data obtained in partial-wave analyses (PWAs). The results for the S-wave phase shifts and mixing angles, as well as for the P-wave amplitudes at zero energy, are presented here. It is shown that these values agree with those extracted previously from other experiments within their uncertainties. In addition to this, we present new results for the D-wave amplitude at zero energy which were not available before. \nI. INTRODUCTIO N\nNeutron-proton elastic scattering has been studied extensively over many decades [1] . This process plays an important role in nuclear physics since it provides information about the nucleon-nucleon interaction potential [2] , which can be used to calculate properties of nuclei [3] .\nIn recent years there have been significant advances in our understanding of the structure of the nucleon-nucleus system [4] . These developments include precise measurements of cross sections [5] , polarization observables [6] , spin-correlation coefficients [7] , etc., performed mainly at intermediate energies [8] . However, despite all efforts made so far, some questions remain open [9] .

{"text":"We report on the controlled collision between an individual trapped atom and a singly charged ion in a Paul trap, where both particles are confined to different regions of space separated by several micrometers. The ions can be moved along the axis connecting them with the atoms using electrostatic fields generated by electrodes outside the vacuum chamber. We demonstrate that this allows us to control the relative velocity at which they collide as well as their impact parameter. This opens up new possibilities for studying fundamental processes such as elastic scattering or charge exchange reactions. In addition we show how it is possible to use these techniques to prepare entanglement between two neutral atoms via a quantum gate operation mediated by one common ion. Quantum information processing requires scalable systems based on many qubits [1] . One promising approach towards realizing such devices relies on neutral atoms stored in optical lattices [2] , but suffers from limited coherence times due to spontaneous emission [3] . An alternative route involves storing atomic qubits in ensembles of trapped ions [4] . However, here too there exist severe limitations arising from decoherence caused by heating [5] .\nIn order to overcome these difficulties, hybrid approaches have been proposed [6] combining advantages of both schemes [7, 8] . Here, the storage of quantum states takes place in a small number of highly coherent ions while large numbers of neutral atoms serve as flying qubits [9] . A crucial requirement for implementing such schemes is the ability to perform high-fidelity operations involving both types of qubit [10] . For example, it has recently been shown experimentally [11] that it is possible to entangle two neutral atoms via a shared ion [12] . To achieve this goal, however, the atoms need to interact with each other before being released into free flight [13] ."}
{"text":"We present an algorithm for counting the number of supersymmetric states with given charge and spin in four-dimensional super Yang-Mills theory (N=4 SYM). The method is based on the use of integrability techniques to compute the spectrum of anomalous dimensions, which are then used as input into a recursion relation that counts the number of states at each level of the Bethe ansatz. We test our results against known exact answers for small values of the charges and find agreement up to numerical precision. Finally we discuss how this approach can be extended beyond the leading order approximation by including corrections due to wrapping interactions between magnons. In recent years there has been considerable interest in understanding the structure of quantum field theories using integrable systems methods [1] . One particularly interesting application of these ideas concerns the study of gauge\/string dualities [2] , where it was shown that certain quantities computed in one description could be related to those obtained in another via the so-called AdS\/CFT correspondence [3] .\nIn particular, the spectrum of anomalous dimension of local gauge-invariant composite operators plays a crucial role in determining physical observables such as correlation functions [4] or Wilson loops [5] . It turns out that many properties of the spectrum of anomalous dimen-sions can be determined exactly [6] - [8] , making it possible to obtain precise predictions about the behaviour of various physical quantities [9] - [11] . However, despite significant progress [12] - [16] , the problem of computing the full spectrum remains open [17] .\nThe aim of this work is to develop new computational tools for studying the spectrum of anomalous dimensionality of composite operators in N = 4 Super-Yang Mills Theory (SYMT) [18] . This will allow us to make further tests of the AdS\/CFT conjecture and also provide insight into the nature of non-perturbative effects in strongly-coupled gauge theories [19] . Our main motivation comes from the fact that the spectrum of anomalous-dimension matrices in SYMT is described by the celebrated Bethe Ansatz [20] . As a result, the computation of the spectrum reduces to solving a set of coupled integral equations [21] whose solution requires sophisticated numerical"}
{"text":"The thermal Casimir force is the quantum mechanical effect that arises when two objects are separated by vacuum, which causes them to attract each other due to zero-point fluctuations in their electromagnetic fields.  In this talk I will present some recent results for the thermal Casimir force between dielectrics as well as related problems such as the van der Waals interaction between polarizable atoms or molecules at finite temperature. The first part of my talk will be devoted to an overview of our work on the subject published recently in Physical Review Letters (PRL) [1] . This includes new exact expressions for the thermal Casimir energy density and pressure valid for arbitrary temperatures and dielectric functions. These formulas can also be used to calculate the leading order corrections to Lifshitz theory [2] , which has been widely applied to describe the Casimir force between real materials [3] .\nIn the second part of my talk I will discuss how these results have been extended to include retardation effects [4] . We find that retardation leads to additional contributions to both the energy density and pressure that depend strongly on the distance between the bodies. Finally, we will show how these results can be used to study the van der Waals interactions between polarizable atoms or molecules; i.e., systems where retardation plays no role but where the dispersion forces still give rise to non-trivial behavior [5] .  For example, we will demonstrate how one can use our formalism to obtain accurate predictions for the critical point of the liquid-vapor phase transition in water [6] ."}
{"text":"The author considers the problem of the redshifts of photons in cosmological models with variable gravitational constant G(t). The main attention is paid to the analysis of the influence of time variation of G on the geometry of space-time, which leads to the appearance of additional terms in the field equations for gravitationally interacting particles (photons) that are absent when considering only the effects of expansion of the universe. It was shown that these new terms lead to an increase in the energy density of photons at large distances from their sources. This effect can be used as one of the arguments supporting the hypothesis about the existence of dark matter around galaxies. In addition, it has been found that the presence of such terms leads to changes in the spectrum of radiation emitted by distant objects due to the fact that the frequency of emission depends not only on the distance between them but also on the rate of change of the gravitational constant over time."}

{"text":"We present the results of high-resolution N-body simulations designed to study the effects of bar-halo friction on galactic disks and halos, as well as the number of particles required to accurately model these processes.  We find that the evolution of disk galaxies is strongly dependent upon their initial halo mass distribution; more massive halos are less affected by the presence of bars than lower-mass halos because they have larger angular momenta and higher central densities. The effect of this process depends primarily on how much energy can be transferred between the bar and its surrounding dark matter halo through dynamical friction. In order to properly resolve this transfer we require at least 10 million particles within each galaxy's virial radius (and preferably 100 million). This requirement increases with decreasing halo concentration parameter cvir = Rvir\/Vvir. For example, if we wish to simulate an isolated Milky Way-like system using a standard NFW profile then we would need about 1 billion particles inside the virial radius."}

{"text":"The geometry of time is the study of how space-time evolves in time.  The axiom of choice states that for any collection of non-empty sets there exists at least one set which contains exactly one element from each set.   In this article we show that if the universe has an underlying quantum structure then it follows that the geometry of time can be described by using the axiom of choice to select a single point on every trajectory through spacetime.   We also discuss some possible implications of our results for neurobiology where the quantum Zeno effect may play a role in explaining certain aspects of brain function such as consciousness. The geometry of time is the mathematical description of how space-time evolutes over time [1] . It was first introduced into physics by Hermann Minkowski [2] who showed that the geometry of space-time could be represented by four numbers (x,y,z,t) called coordinates or co-ordinates. These are related by the following equation:  x2+y2-z2-t2=(c^2)(1-(v\/c))1\/2   Where c represents the speed of light and v represents the velocity of the object being observed. This equation describes the relationship between distance travelled along the x-axis, y-axis, z-axis and t-axis respectively. For example, if you were observing someone walking across your living room floor with their back towards you they would have a positive value for the x-axis but no values for the other three axes because they are not moving in those directions. If however you were watching them walk away from you they would have negative values for all three axes except the x-axis since they are still travelling forward in that direction. As another example consider two objects traveling side-by-side down a roadway. They will both travel at the same speed so their velocities will be equal. However, if one car travels north while the other travels south they will appear to move faster than each other even though they are traveling at the same speed."}
{"text":"We present an analysis of early X-ray afterglow data for eight gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) in which we find evidence that they are associated with relativistic jets viewed off-axis, and show how this can be used to probe jet structure. We use our model to predict the late-time behaviour of these GRB afterglows and compare it with observations made by Swift\/XRT. The results suggest that the majority of GRB jets have a structured energy distribution, with most of the kinetic energy contained within a narrow cone along the jet axis. This is consistent with theoretical expectations based on models where GRBs result from the collapse of massive stars into black holes or neutron stars. \nIntroduction\n\nGamma-ray bursts (GRBs; see Piran 2004 , Gehrels et al. 2009 ) are brief flashes of high-energy radiation lasting typically 10 s but ranging up to several hundred seconds. They were first detected over 50 years ago (Klebesadel et al. 1973; Strong et al. 1974) , but despite extensive observational efforts there remain many open questions about them. In particular, what powers the emission? What causes the observed diversity between different bursts?\nThe standard fireball model (see e.g., Rees & Meszaros 1992; Sari 1997; Piran 1999; Wijers 2001; Kumar & Zhang 2015) provides one explanation for the prompt phase of GRB emission. It involves the dissipation of kinetic energy stored in a relativistically expanding shell of plasma produced during some catastrophic event such as the merger of two compact objects or the collapse of a massive star. However, this model cannot explain all aspects of GRB phenomenology. For example, it does not account for the wide range of durations seen across the population of GRBs (e.g., Nakar 2007), nor do current models provide any satisfactory explanation for why only a small fraction of collapsing stars produce observable GRBs (e. g., Bromm & Loeb 2006) . Furthermore, the lack of detection of optical counterparts to short-duration GRBs has led to suggestions that at least some"}

{"text":"Globular clusters are dense stellar systems that contain thousands to millions of stars, and may be the oldest gravitationally bound objects known.  The discovery of planets around other stars has raised questions about whether or not globular cluster members can also harbor planetary systems.   In this work we use Monte Carlo simulations to examine how many planets could exist within globular clusters with different masses and ages.  We find that for most reasonable assumptions on planet formation rates, there should be at least one planet per star in all but the youngest (<10 Myr) and lowest mass (<100 Msun) clusters.  This result is robust against uncertainties in our knowledge of planet formation efficiencies and initial conditions such as the number density distribution of planetesimals.  Our results suggest that it will be possible to detect planets orbiting globular cluster members using current observational techniques.

{"text":"We study the possibility that instantons induce neutrino masses and mixings, which are compatible with current experimental data on neutrinos. We consider type IIB orientifold compactifications to four dimensions with intersecting D-branes at singularities. The Standard Model gauge group is realized by stacks of branes wrapping 3-cycles inside Calabi-Yau threefolds. In addition we include stacks of branes wrapped around 2-cycles corresponding to hidden sectors. These models can be engineered such that they have an MSSM-like spectrum. Instanton effects lead to corrections to the superpotential involving fermions localized on different stacks of branes. This leads to Majorana mass terms for right-handed neutrinos. We show how these results can be used to construct realistic string inspired models of leptogenesis. We also discuss possible phenomenological consequences of our scenario. Introduction: String theory provides many new avenues towards understanding physics beyond the Standard Model (SM). One interesting class of scenarios involves extra spatial dimensions where SM fields live on a 3-brane while gravity propagates into the bulk [1] . A particularly appealing feature of this setup is that it allows for TeV scale quantum gravity without conflicting with precision tests of general relativity [2] .\nIn recent years there has been much interest in studying supersymmetric extensions of the SM within the context of string theory [3] - [8] . Supersymmetry stabilizes the electroweak hierarchy problem [9] , predicts unification of all coupling constants [10] and offers solutions to other open problems like dark matter [11] or baryogenesis [12] . However, despite its successes as a theoretical framework, no direct evidence for SUSY exists so far [13] . It would therefore be very exciting if some of the predictions made by SUSY could be tested experimentally [14] .\nOne important question concerns the origin of neutrino masses [15] . While the seesaw mechanism [16] explains naturally small neutrino masses [17] , it requires additional particles not present in the minimal version of the SM [18] . An alternative approach consists in considering non-renormalizable operators induced by instantons [19] . Such contributions may arise when"}
{"text":"We study vacuum energy in quantum field theory with boundary conditions that break conformal invariance, such as Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions. We show how to renormalize this quantity using zeta function regularization techniques. In particular we find that for any number of dimensions there is an infinite set of counterterms which must be included when computing the vacuum energy density at zero temperature. This result has implications for Casimir effect calculations where one considers two parallel plates separated by some distance. The presence of these additional terms can lead to significant changes in the results obtained previously. Finally we consider the case of fermions coupled to scalar fields and compute the vacuum expectation value of the stress-energy tensor. For certain values of the coupling constant it turns out that the vacuum state becomes unstable due to spontaneous symmetry breaking. Vacuum energy plays an important role in many areas of physics including cosmology [1] , black hole thermodynamics [2] , and condensed matter systems [3] . It also appears in various contexts within string theory [4] .\nIn recent years much progress has been made towards understanding the nature of vacuum fluctuations in quantum field theories (QFTs) [5] - [8] . However most work done so far has focused primarily on QFTs defined on flat space-time manifolds without boundaries [9] - [11] .

{"text":"We show that the inclusion of higher-order gravitational wave modes in the analysis of data from future space-based detectors such as LISA can significantly improve their sensitivity to massive black hole binaries with total masses above 10^9 M_sol. We find that, when including all relevant modes up to = 4 (quadrupole and octopole), the signal-to-noise ratio increases by more than an order of magnitude compared to using only quadrupolar waves. This is due to the fact that higher-order modes carry additional information about the source which allows us to better distinguish between different types of signals. In particular, we demonstrate how this effect enables us to detect binary systems containing intermediate-mass black holes whose existence has been predicted by recent numerical simulations but have not yet been observed directly. The results presented here are based on our new semi-analytic model for the inspiral phase of generic spinning black hole binaries developed within the Effective One-Body framework."}

{"text":"We prove that the transitive powers of the so-called ``Young-Jucys-Murphy\" (YJM) elements in any finite group G form an abelian subgroup of G, which is central if and only if G has no non-trivial normal subgroups. The YJM elements were introduced by Jucys and Murphy as generators for the center of the symmetric group S_n. We use this result to give a new proof of the fact that the center of the wreath product H \u2240 S_n equals the direct sum of the centers of H and S_n. This also yields a simple proof of the fact that every element in the center of a finite group can be written as a linear combination of commutators with coefficients \u00b11. \nIntroduction\n\nLet G be a finite group. In their seminal work on the representation theory of the symmetric groups [Juc77] , Jucys and Murphy defined certain elements in the center Z(S_n) of the symmetric group S_n$ over the field F_q . These elements have been studied extensively since then; see e.g.  [BW03,  BW04,   BZ08,   ? ] .\nIn particular, it was shown in [BW03]  that these elements generate all of the center of S_n when n > 2 or q = p^r where r > 1.   It follows immediately from this theorem that the center of S_n contains at least one noncentral element whenever n < 4 or q = p^1 .  However, it remained open whether there exist other examples of finite groups whose center does not contain any noncentral elements besides those already known such as cyclic groups, dihedral groups, alternating groups etc. . \nThe main goal of our present article is to answer this question affirmatively by proving the following result:"}

The results show that the quark-antiquark pair has positive helicity for small invariant mass while it changes its helicity sign at large invariant mass. This is consistent with the experimental data obtained from J\/$\\psi$ decay into two pions.

For example, the helicity structure of mesons such as $\\psi(1s)$ or $\\phi(1s)$ are studied extensively both theoretically [1] - [4] and experimentally [5] , which gives us useful information about the confinement mechanism [6] .\nRecently, there have been many theoretical studies on the helicity structure of heavy-light mesons [7, 8] . However, most of them do not take account of the effect of spin-spin interaction between quarks explicitly although they play an important role in determining the helicity structure of hadrons [9] . Therefore, in order to understand more clearly the helicity structure of heavylight mesons, it would be necessary to consider the effect of spin-spin force explicitly."}
{"text":"We have investigated how different spectral models affect the inferred X-ray luminosity (Lx) and temperature (kT ) for ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs). We used two sets of data, one set with high signal-to-noise ratio (S\/N), which is suitable to fit by using simple blackbody model or power-law model; another set has low S\/N, where more complicated models are required in order to obtain reasonable fits. For each source we fitted all available spectra simultaneously with various combinations of models including blackbody, diskbb+powerlaw, nthcomp+nthcomp, bbodyrad+bbodyrad, comptt+diskbb, and mekal+mekal. The results show that Lx can be overestimated up to an order of magnitude if only single component model was adopted. In addition, kT obtained from fitting with single-component model may also deviate significantly from those derived from multi-component models.  These findings suggest that it should be cautious when interpreting the physical properties of ULXs based solely on their observed fluxes and\/or temperatures."}

In addition we have investigated how these parameters vary as function of luminosity class and evolutionary status. Our main conclusions are:  - Massive stars show significant differences between their winds depending on whether they are evolved or not.  - For evolved objects there seems to be an increase in v\u221e towards higher luminosities which can be explained by radiation pressure driving.  - There appears to be no clear trend in CF with luminosity but it increases significantly when comparing early- and late-O supergiants.  - The derived values of \u1e40 do not depend strongly on luminosity class but seem to decrease slightly with age."}

{"text":"We present new high resolution observations of the interstellar medium in the direction of the North Ecliptic Pole, made with the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope at 1.4 GHz.

We find evidence for two distinct components to this filamentary structure; one component has a relatively low column density but extends over several degrees on the sky while another component appears more compact and denser. These results are discussed within the context of recent WMAP measurements which show excess microwave emission towards the north ecliptic pole region.

Subsequent studies have shown that these excesses can be explained by thermal bremsstrahlung emission from ionized gas located between us and distant galaxies (Finkbeiner 2004 , Davies et al 2005 .\nIn addition to the NEP regions, other areas of interest include the Perseus-Pisces supercluster complex (Davies et al 2006) , the Coma cluster (Vogeley & Birkinshaw 1996) and the Virgo Cluster (Taylor et al 2002) .

{"text":"We have investigated how different assumptions about the velocity distribution function (VDF) affect the shape of the observed line profile in the solar corona, using an analytical model for the VDF that includes both isotropic thermal motions and anisotropic nonthermal motions. We find that the inclusion of nonthermal motions can significantly alter the shapes of the simulated line profiles compared with those obtained assuming purely Maxwellian distributions. The effects are more pronounced when the plasma temperature decreases and\/or the degree of anisotropy increases. \n \n In particular, we show that the presence of nonthermal motions leads to significant asymmetries between the red-and blueshifted wings of the line profiles. These results suggest that it may be possible to use observations of coronal lines to constrain the properties of the underlying VDFs.

{"text":"We present an analysis of all known short-period cataclysmic variables (CVs) in which we find that most systems have orbital periods longer than 3 hrs and are dominated by SW Sex stars, while those with shorter periods tend to be AM Her binaries. We show that this dichotomy is consistent with theoretical predictions for the evolution of CVs driven by angular momentum loss via gravitational radiation. The observed distribution of orbital periods can also be explained if there exists a minimum period below which no CVs exist due to magnetic braking. This result has important implications on our understanding of how CVs evolve towards shorter orbital periods. Cataclysmic Variables (CVs), interacting binary star systems consisting of a white dwarf primary accreting matter from its low-mass companion through Roche lobe overflow, are among the best studied classes of close binary stars. They provide unique opportunities to study many aspects of astrophysics such as stellar structure and evolution, mass transfer processes, nuclear burning at high temperatures, and relativistic effects near compact objects. In particular, they offer insights into the formation mechanisms of both single and double degenerate white dwarfs, the progenitors of Type Ia supernovae."}
{"text":"The question whether time is an illusion or not has been debated for centuries, and the answer remains elusive.  In this article we will examine some of the arguments that have been put forward in favour of the existence of time as well as those against it.

Finally, we will look at how quantum mechanics may provide us with new insights into the nature of time. The question \"Does time exist?\" has been asked many times throughout history by philosophers, scientists and ordinary people alike. It seems like such a simple question but there are actually several different ways one can interpret what \"time\" means when asking about its existence. For example, if you ask yourself \"Is time real?\" your answer might be yes because you think that time is something that exists independently of any observer (i.e., outside of ourselves). On the other hand, if you were to ask yourself \"Do I experience time passing?\" your answer would probably be no since you believe that only humans experience time."}

The experimental results show that the forward-scattering intensity is strongly dependent on the refractive index contrast between the cell cytoplasm and surrounding medium as well as on the size distribution of the scatterers inside each cell. In addition to the main peak in the forward direction at small angles, we observe two additional peaks at larger scattering angles corresponding to higher-order multipolar contributions. We find good agreement between our measurements and calculations for both the angular dependence of the scattered intensity and its polarization state.

{"text":"We study the dynamics of spatially homogeneous but anisotropic Bianchi type I universes in Loop Quantum Cosmology (LQC). We show that for generic initial conditions these solutions are unstable against small perturbations. This instability is due to the fact that the classical singularity at $t=0$ is replaced by a bounce in LQC which leads to an oscillatory behavior around the bouncing point. The amplitude of this oscillation grows exponentially with time if one starts sufficiently close to the singularity. In order to obtain stable solutions we introduce a lattice refinement scheme into our numerical analysis. Our results indicate that there exists a large class of stable solutions which can be approximated very well by the corresponding Wheeler-DeWitt equation. These solutions have a similar structure as those found previously within the context of isotropic LQC.

The results are explained within mean-field theory using a free energy functional approach. DOI: 10.1063\/1.3189000\nI. INTRODUCTIO N\nThe addition of small particles (depletants) to colloidal suspensions can lead to dramatic changes in their structure [1] . In particular, it has been shown experimentally [2] , theoretically [3] , and computationally [4] that adding nonadsorbing polymer chains or other types of depletants leads to the formation of ordered structures such as crystals [5] .\nIn this work we consider the case where the depletants are spherical particles which do not adsorb onto the surfaces of the larger colloids [6] . This type of interaction between the two species gives rise to a rich variety of phenomena [7, 8] including liquid crystal phases [9] . Here we focus our attention on one aspect of these mixtures -the effect of depletants upon the smectic phases formed by mixtures of hard rods and spheres [10] . Smectics are mesophases characterized by layers of parallel oriented molecules separated by regions of disordered fluid [11] .

In order to study the properties of such a plasma puddle, we use a fluid description where the charge carriers are treated as particles moving under the influence of electric fields generated by their own motion. Using this approach, we find that there exists a critical value of the applied voltage Vc above which the plasma puddle becomes unstable against perturbations. For voltages larger than Vc , the plasma puddle collapses into a single point-like object called a \"plasma ball\"."}
{"text":"We study the effects of noise on spatially extended systems by using an extension of the concept of nonequilibrium potential (NEP). We show that NEPs can be used to characterize different types of stochastic resonances, such as those observed for excitable and bistable systems near their respective Hopf bifurcations. In particular we find that the presence of noise enhances the amplitude of oscillations in both cases but with very different mechanisms. For excitable systems this is due to the fact that noise increases the probability of crossing the threshold between two stable states; while for bistable systems it occurs because noise induces transitions between these states. Finally, we discuss how our results are related to previous studies based on other approaches. Stochastic resonance has been studied extensively during recent years [1] . It refers to the phenomenon whereby weak signals can be enhanced or detected more easily when they are embedded into a noisy background [2] .\nIn many physical situations, however, one needs to consider not only the effect of external noise sources but also internal fluctuations arising from the dynamics itself [3] . This problem becomes particularly relevant if the signal-to-noise ratio is small [4] , which may occur either because the signal is intrinsically weak or because its intensity is comparable to the level of intrinsic noise [5] . Moreover, even though the signal is strong enough so that it could be clearly distinguished without any additional noise [6] , there might still exist some optimal amount of noise that maximizes the detection efficiency [7, 8] ."}
{"text":"We study the gravitational self-force acting on a wave packet in curved spacetime, and show that it causes its distortion.  We consider two types of wavepackets: one is constructed by superposing plane waves with different frequencies; another is made up of spherical waves emitted at various angles around an isolated source point. In both cases we find that the force acts as if there were additional sources located behind the packet's center-of-mass worldline. The effect can be understood intuitively using the concept of \"gravitational memory\". Our results are relevant for understanding how gravitational waves propagate through space-time. They also provide new insights into the problem of gravitational radiation reaction. Introduction - A fundamental question about gravitational waves (GWs) concerns how they evolve over time when propagating through curved space-time [1] . This issue has been studied extensively within the framework of linearized gravity theory [2] , where GWs are treated as small perturbations of flat Minkowski background geometry [3] .\nIn this work we focus on the effects due to gravitational self-coupling [4] . These arise because each part of a GW carries energy density which exerts pressure back onto itself via Newtonian gravity [5] . As such, the total force acting upon any given portion of a GW depends not only on the local curvature but also on the entire history of the wave [6] . It turns out that these forces cause significant distortions of the wave packets [7, 8] . For example, the shape of a plane-wave packet changes during propagation so that its peak moves away from the direction of motion [9] . Similar behavior was found for spherical wave packets [10] ."}

For multiplicative noise they depend also on the shape of the power spectral density (PSD) of the noise. In particular, if the PSD has a peak around zero frequency then the optimal noise intensity decreases as the width of this peak increases. If the PSD does not have such a peak but decays monotonically towards zero frequencies then the optimal noise intensity increases as the decay rate becomes slower. Finally, if the PSD decays faster than exponentially then the optimal noise intensity remains constant irrespective of how fast the PSD decays."}
{"text":"We present the mid-infrared (MIR) spectrum of the central region in the Virgo galaxy cluster, obtained with Spitzer\/IRS at high spatial resolution. The MIR emission is dominated by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon features and silicate absorption bands that are spatially extended over several kpc scales along the minor axis of the galaxy. We find evidence for an additional component to this emission which peaks on top of the nucleus within 0.5 arcsec (0.1 pc). This nuclear source has been previously detected as a compact radio core and near-infrared continuum source but not seen before in the infrared spectral domain. It shows strong PAH emission lines and weak fine-structure line emission. In addition we detect a number of other sources in the field-of-view including two bright starburst galaxies located about 10 arcmin away from M87. These results show that the MIR properties of active galactic nuclei can be studied even if they reside in crowded fields such as those found near the center of rich clusters like Virgo."}
{"text":"We present the results of an analysis of archival Hubble Space Telescope (HST) data for two open clusters, NGC 6705 and NGC 6819. We use these observations to determine ages, masses, radii, and distances for each star in both clusters using isochrone fitting techniques. The resulting mass functions are then compared with those predicted by theoretical models. Our main conclusions are:  1. Both clusters have similar age distributions but different mass distributions.  2. The observed mass function slopes agree well with predictions made by standard IMF theory when we assume that all stars more massive than 8 Msun were destroyed during supernovae explosions.  3. There appears to be no significant difference between the number of low-mass stars found within the central regions of the clusters as opposed to their outer regions. 4. The total number of high-mass stars in the clusters agrees very well with the expected number based on our knowledge of the initial mass function."}
{"text":"We present an alternative formulation for the Kuramoto model that is based on a linearization of the original nonlinear system and leads to a more efficient numerical solution method than existing approaches.  The new approach can be used in combination with any standard solver, such as Newton's or fixed-point iteration methods. We demonstrate its performance by applying it to several examples including networks of coupled phase oscillators and chaotic systems. Synchronized behavior has been observed across many different fields ranging from physics [1] , biology [2] , chemistry [3] , engineering [4] , and social sciences [5] . In particular, synchronization phenomena are often studied using models of interacting dynamical systems [6] .\nThe most commonly used mathematical description of synchronized dynamics is given by the Kuramoto model [7, 8] which describes how N identical oscillators evolve over time t according to: \nwhere \u03b8i(t) \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0[ denotes the phase angle of oscillator i at time t, \u03c9i > 0 represents the natural frequency of each individual oscillator, and Kij \u2265 0 quantifies the strength of interaction between oscillators i and j.

{"text":"The electronic properties of carbon nanotubes are calculated using density functional theory (DFT) with the local-density approximation (LDA). The results show that the band gap decreases as tube diameter increases, which is in agreement with previous calculations based on tight-binding models. In addition to this effect, we find that the energy difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), i.e., the HOMO-LUMO gap also depends strongly on tube diameter. We propose an empirical model for calculating these gaps by fitting our data points to simple functions of tube diameter. This model can be used to predict the electronic structure of any given carbon nanotube within reasonable accuracy. Finally, we discuss how the presence of defects affects the electronic structure of carbon nanotubes. The electronic properties of carbon nanotubes' are investigated theoretically using density-functional-theory (DFT) with LDA. It has been found that both the valence-band maximum (VBM) and conduction-band minimum (CBM) shift towards higher energies when the tube diameter increases. Furthermore, it was observed that the VBM shifts more rapidly than CBM so that the bandgap decreases as the tube diameter increases. An empirical model is proposed to calculate the bandgaps of carbon nanotubes."}

{"text":"We have analyzed the statistical properties of giant pulses (GPs) detected in radio observations at 1.4 GHz with the Arecibo Observatory and compared them to those observed for GPs at other frequencies.  We find that the distribution of pulse widths is consistent with a log-normal function, as found previously by Cordes et al. (2004), but we also find evidence for an additional component which may be due to interstellar scattering or intrinsic effects within the source itself. The mean flux density of GPs decreases rapidly with increasing frequency above about 400 MHz; this decrease can be described well using a power law model with index -1.5 \u00b1 0.1. This result suggests that there are two populations of GPs: one population whose emission mechanism has a low-frequency cutoff near 400 MHz, and another population whose emission mechanism extends up to at least 2 GHz.

We find that the orbits of both giant planets are significantly affected by their mutual gravitational interaction as well as by the presence of other planetary embryos. The eccentricity growth is dominated by secular interactions between the two planets which lead to large amplitude oscillations in the semi-major axes. In addition we find that the planet migration rates depend strongly on the initial conditions for the system parameters such as mass ratio and separation distance. \n \n Keywords: Planet formation - Giant planets - Eccentricities - Migration - Disk instability - Secular resonance - Dynamical chaos - N-body simulations \n \n \n \n 1 Introduction \n \n Planets form out of dust particles through coagulation processes (Safronov 1969; Wetherill & Stewart 1989) followed by runaway accretion onto these growing objects (Lissauer 1987). This process leads to the formation of planetesimals whose masses range from 10$^{\u22126}$ M\u2295 up to several Earth masses. These bodies can grow further into larger planetary embryos or even directly into gas giants like Jupiter and Saturn if they accrete enough material within a short time span (Pollack et al. 1996) . Once formed, these massive planets open gaps in the surrounding circumstellar disks due to tidal torques exerted by the planet's gravity (Lin & Papaloizou 1986 ). As a consequence, the remaining matter inside this gap will be removed rapidly by viscosity effects leading to rapid inward type II migration of the planet (Ward 1997; Tanaka et al. 2002 ) . \nThe observed distribution of exoplanets shows a wide variety of orbital configurations ranging from circular orbits around Sun-like stars to highly eccentric orbits around low-mass stars (see e.g., Marcy et al.

{"text":"We present kinetic theory expressions for the transport coefficients in binary granular mixtures, valid to leading order in the low-density limit.

One important class of problems concerns the rheology [12] - [14] or flow properties [15] - [17] of dense granular flows [18] - [20] . Another interesting problem involves the diffusion [21] - [23] and segregation [24] - [26] of different species within a granular mixture [27] - [29] . These issues can be addressed using kinetic theories [30] - [32] based on the Boltzmann equation [33] - [35] . However, it remains an open question how to extend this approach beyond the dilute regime [36] - [38] where the usual Enskog expansion [39] applies.\nIn this work we develop a kinetic theory description of binary granular mixtures applicable to arbitrary densities.

{"text":"We present the discovery and analysis of two double neutron stars (DNSs) with masses in excess of 2 M_sun, PSR J0737-3039A\/B and PSR B1913+16.

The latter consists of a pulsar orbiting around its companion's helium core after having ejected most of its hydrogen-rich envelope during mass transfer on the red giant branch. We argue that these systems provide evidence for two different formation mechanisms for DNSs: one where both components are formed through normal stellar evolution, and another where only one component forms via this process while the other is born as a black hole or massive white dwarf. This second mechanism may be responsible for some short gamma-ray bursts. DOI: 10.1103\/PhysRevD.76.084011"}

In addition to these structural features, we also examine how the flow of goods changes over time across different parts of the network. Our results show that there exist several distinct phases during which the flow of goods increases or decreases significantly at certain locations on the network.

{"text":"We study the time evolution of neutral mesons in coherent states, which are superpositions of different number states with equal amplitudes. We show that this leads to CP violation even if there is no explicit CP-violating phase present in the Lagrangian density describing the system. The effect arises because the decay widths for the two mass eigenstates differ by a factor of $(-1)^{N}$ where $N$ denotes the total number of particles produced in the decay process. This difference can be understood as arising due to interference between Feynman diagrams corresponding to decays into odd and even numbers of final-state particles. Our results provide new insights on how CP violation may arise in nature. They also have implications for experiments searching for direct CP violation in B-decay processes at hadron colliders such as LHCb. \n \n Introduction \n \n It has been known since 1964 [1] that quantum mechanics allows for spontaneous breaking of parity (P), charge conjugation (C), and\/or time reversal symmetry (T). Such violations occur when the vacuum state of some field does not respect these symmetries [2] .

INTRODUCTORY REMARK\nIn this work we consider the problem of randomly placing N identical objects onto M sites of a regular two-dimensional lattice such that no two objects overlap each other. This process is called Random Sequential Adsorption (RSA). It has been studied extensively over many years [1] . Recently there have also been several studies concerning the competition between different types of objects [2] , e.g., between particles and holes [3] or between different species [4] .\nThe simplest case of RSA corresponds to the so-called monodisperse situation where all objects are equal. Here the main quantity of interest is the fraction of filled sites f(t), i.e., the number of occupied sites divided by the total number of sites after t steps. At large times f(t) approaches its saturation value f sat = lim t\u2192\u221e f(t).\nFor the monodisperse case it was shown [5] that f sat scales like f sat ~ N\/M \u03b1 with some scaling exponent 0 < \u03b1 \u2264 1 depending on the dimension d of the underlying space.

{"text":"We present an approach for the calculation of resonance saturation corrections to hadronic matrix elements within the framework of large-Nc QCD, which is based on the use of chiral perturbation theory and dispersion relations. The method allows one to calculate systematically higher-order terms in 1\/Nc beyond leading order. We apply this formalism to the case of the pion-nucleon sigma term and show that it leads to results compatible with those obtained by other methods. In particular we find that the inclusion of subleading 1\/Nc corrections reduces significantly the value of the sigma term as compared to its leading-order estimate. This reduction can be understood intuitively in terms of the effect of mesonic loops dressing up the nucleon propagator at low energies. \nI. INTRODUCTORY REMARkS\nThe study of low-energy phenomena in strong interactions has been traditionally dominated by phenomenological models such as constituent quark models or effective field theories like Chiral Perturbation Theory (ChPT). However, these approaches are not able to provide quantitative predictions without introducing additional parameters whose values have to be fixed either by comparison with experimental data or by using some model-dependent assumptions. On the contrary, lattice gauge calculations suffer from systematic uncertainties related to finite volume effects and discretization errors. A possible way out consists in combining both types of techniques in what is known as hybrid approaches [1] . One example of this type of approach is given by the so-called \"rainbow-ladder truncation\" [2] , where the Dyson-Schwinger equations [3] are solved numerically together with the Bethe-Salpeter equation [4] .\nIn recent years there has also been considerable interest in applying ideas coming from Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) to describe low-energy processes involving pions and nucleons [5] - [8] . These studies are usually performed within the context of the 1\/Nc expansion [9] , where Nc denotes the number of colors of quarks. Within this scheme, the lowest-order contribution corresponds to tree-level diagrams containing only valence quarks; next-to-leading contributions arise when sea quarks are included through loop diagrams;"}
{"text":"We have investigated the coupling between magnetic ordering and structural instability in BiFeO3 by using density functional theory (DFT). We find that ferroelectricity is induced by spin-current mechanism, which can be understood as follows. The Fe-3d orbitals hybridize with O-2p orbitals to form bonding and antibonding states near Fermi level. When spins are parallel along z-direction, the antibonding state lies above Fermi energy while the bonding state below it. This leads to an increase of electron charge at Bi-6s orbital and decrease at O-2p orbital on one side of unit cell, resulting in polarization pointing towards this side. On the other hand, when spins are antiparallel along z-direction, both antibonding and bonding states lie below Fermi energy leading to no net polarization. In addition, we also found that there exists strong spin-phonon interaction due to large magnetostriction effect."}

We find that when the inner edge of the disc is located at or near to the marginally stable circular orbit (rmsco), it undergoes periodic radial excursions due to Lense-Thirring precession induced by the spinning black hole. The periodicity of these radial motions depends on the spin parameter of the black hole and its mass. In addition, we also find that there are two other types of oscillations: one with longer periods which may be associated with low frequency quasi-periodic oscillations observed in X-ray binaries; another type has shorter periods but higher amplitudes than those found previously. These short-period oscillations can explain some features of high-frequency quasiperiodic oscillations observed in galactic microquasars like GRS 1915+105."}
{"text":"We present results for the two-way coupling between an incompressible, isothermal fluid and a dilute suspension of elastic dumbbell particles in a plane Couette geometry at Reynolds number Re = 1000. The particle phase consists of N p = 10 5 identical dumbbells suspended in a Newtonian solvent. We use a hybrid lattice Boltzmann method to solve the Navier-Stokes equations coupled to a finite element solver for the evolution of the dumbbell configuration. In addition we employ a novel algorithm that allows us to efficiently compute the hydrodynamic forces on each individual dumbbell by solving only one Stokes problem per time step instead of Np problems as would be required if the standard approach were used. This leads to significant computational savings especially when large numbers of dumbbells are considered. \n \n For small values of the relaxation parameter \u03bb (\u03bb < 0.5) we find that the presence of the particles has little effect on the mean velocity profile but significantly alters its fluctuations. As expected, increasing the value of \u03bb increases both the magnitude of the fluctuations and their correlation length scale."}
{"text":"We propose a new string derived model with stable proton in which the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) is not neutralino but gravitino. The LSP decays into photon or neutrino-antineutrino pair through gravitational interaction. In this scenario we can explain the observed dark matter abundance without conflicting with other experimental results such as relic density measurement by WMAP experiment. We also show that our model predicts interesting signatures at LHC experiments. Introduction:-The discovery of Higgs boson [1-3] has opened up an exciting possibility to explore physics beyond Standard Model(SM). Supersymmetry(SUSY), one of the most promising extensions of SM [4] , provides natural solution for hierarchy problem [5] . However, SUSY models are severely constrained by various experimental observations [6] .\nIn order to solve these problems, several authors have proposed different mechanisms [7-9]. One of them is introducing additional gauge symmetries [10] . Another way is adding extra dimensions [11] . Recently, it was shown that there exists a class of string derived models where the lightest superpartner is gravitino [12] . Gravitino is weakly interacting massive particle so its decay rate is suppressed compared to neutralino case [13] . This feature makes gravitino a good candidate for cold dark matter [14] . Moreover, if gravitino mass m 3\/2 < 1 GeV then its lifetime becomes longer than age of universe [15] . Therefore, gravitino may be regarded as a viable candidate for dark matter [16] . On the other hand, gravitino is unstable because it couples to gravity [17] . It decays into photon or lepton-neutrino pairs [18] . If gravitino is heavier than 100 MeV then its decay products will contribute to diffuse gamma ray background [19] . Thus, gravitino should satisfy following conditions [20] :"}
{"text":"The measurement calculus is an extension to the standard quantum mechanics formalism that allows for measurements on composite systems, and it has been used in several recent works as well as in this thesis.  The main idea behind the measurement calculus is to consider all possible outcomes of a measurement process as separate states of the system being measured instead of just one outcome (as done by von Neumann). This approach leads naturally to considering the set of all possible measurement results as a new state space called the effect algebra. In addition, the measurement calculus provides a way to describe how different measurement processes can be combined into more complex ones using so-called instruments. Finally, the measurement calculus also includes a description of what happens when we perform a measurement on a system whose state is not known exactly but only up to some uncertainty. The measurement calculus was first introduced by Aharonov et al., and since then there have been many papers written about its properties and applications."}
{"text":"We study phase transitions for coloring random graphs with bounded maximum degree using the first moment method and the second moment method.  We show that if the number of colors is at least $\\Omega(\\log n)$, then there exists an absolute constant $c > 0$ such that any graph on $n$ vertices with average degree $< c \\log n$ can be colored with probability $1 - O(1\/n)$ by choosing each vertex independently to have one of its colors uniformly at random (Theorem 1).  This result improves upon previous results which required the number of colors to grow faster than linearly as a function of the number of vertices.  In addition, we prove that if the number of available colors is only $O(1)$, then there exist graphs on $n$ vertices with average degrees $< c \\log n$ that cannot be colored with high probability unless $P = NP$ (Theorem 2). Finally, we use our techniques to obtain new bounds on the chromatic thresholds of several families of random graphs including the Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi model $G_{n, p}$, the configuration model, and the preferential attachment model."}
{"text":"We present an algorithm for learning the parameters of a probabilistic model by optimizing its log-likelihood using Monte Carlo (MC) sampling, which we call Parametric Learning with MC Sampling or PLMS. We show that this approach is equivalent to maximum likelihood estimation when the number of samples goes to infinity. In practice however, it can be much more efficient than standard gradient-based optimization methods because it does not require computing gradients over all data points at each iteration. Instead, only one sample per iteration needs to be generated in order to compute the objective function value and update the parameter values accordingly. This makes our method particularly suitable for large datasets where evaluating the objective function may take too much time. Our experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that PLMS outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms such as stochastic gradient descent and Adam in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.

Our sample consists of eight young active stars that are members of open clusters or associations within 100 pc of Earth. The observed rotational periods range from 0.5 days up to several weeks. Using Zeeman-Doppler imaging techniques we reconstruct maps of the stellar surfaces for each star showing both the distribution of the longitudinal component of the magnetic field vector and the local line-of-sight velocity. These maps reveal significant differences among our targets. Some show strong toroidal components while others have more complex structures dominated by poloidal fields. In addition, some objects exhibit large regions where the magnetic field is nearly aligned with the axis of rotation."}
{"text":"We present results on turbulent mixing in accretion disks around neutron stars, obtained with 3D hydrodynamical simulations using the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method. We find that turbulence is driven by shear instabilities and convection at low viscosities, while it is dominated by Kelvin-Helmholtz instability at high viscosities. The resulting vertical profiles of density are consistent with observations for several X-ray binaries. In addition to this we also study how the composition changes as a result of nuclear burning processes occurring within the disk. Our results show that the surface layers of these objects can be enriched upto solar metallicity due to nuclear burning. This enrichment may have important consequences for the observed properties of these systems such as their spectra and light curves. \n \n Keywords: Turbulence, Nuclear burning, SPH, Accretion disk, Neutrino emission, Xray binary"}
{"text":"We present an algorithm that determines whether or not there exists a quantum circuit with a given number of qubits and gates, such that the corresponding time-independent Hamiltonian is realizable by a physical system in which each energy level has at most one excited state.  We also show how to find all possible circuits if they exist. Our results are based on recent work showing that any time-independent Hamiltonian can be written as a sum of commuting projectors onto its eigenstates. This decomposition allows us to reduce the problem of finding a realization of a general time-independent Hamiltonian into several instances of the same problem but restricted to smaller Hilbert spaces. The reduction yields a polynomial-time algorithm when applied recursively. Finally we discuss some applications of our method including determining the minimum depth required for universal adiabatic quantum computers. In this article we consider the following problem: \nGiven a set of n qubits and m two-qubit gates, does there exist a quantum circuit consisting only of these gates whose associated time-independent Hamiltonian is realizable; i.e., it corresponds to a Hermitian operator acting on a finite-dimensional Hilbert space? If so, what is the smallest circuit size needed?\nThe answer to this question will depend on the specifics of the model used to describe the physical system under consideration. For example, in the case where each energy level may have more than one excited state (i.e., degenerate), then no circuit can realize the desired Hamiltonian unless it contains infinitely many gates. On the other hand, if each energy level has exactly one excited state (i.."}

Introduction \n \n In 2009 we reported the discovery of a new SW Sex type nova-like variable BH Lyn (Kato et al., 2009) . It showed a large amplitude variation of about 3 mag between maximum brightness and minimum one. This object has been classified as a member of the SW Sex class because it exhibits all typical characteristics such as: double-humped emission-line profiles; prominent phase-dependent absorption lines; rapid flickering superposed on smooth sinusoidal variations; and deep eclipses lasting for several hours . However, there are some differences compared to other members of the class: BH Lyn has a shorter orbital period (P orb = 0.084 d), stronger magnetic field strength (B > 10 MG), and higher mass transfer rate (\u1e40 ~10\u22127 M\u2299 yr\u22121).

{"text":"The physisorption of nucleobases (adenine, cytosine, guanine and thymine) onto graphene is investigated by density functional theory calculations at the B3LYP\/6-31G(d) level in vacuum conditions. The results show that all four bases are adsorbed on the surface with different binding energies ranging between -0.27 eV for adenine to -1.10 eV for cytosine. In addition, it was found that the adsorption energy decreases as the number of nitrogen atoms increases. This indicates that the interaction strength depends strongly on the electronegativity of the base molecules. It has been shown that the most stable configuration corresponds to an end-on orientation where the carbonyl oxygen atom interacts directly with one of the C-C bonds of the graphene sheet. \n \n Keywords: Physisorption; Graphene; Nucleobase; Density Functional Theory Calculations. Introduction \n \n Graphene is a two-dimensional material consisting of sp2-hybridized carbon atoms arranged into a honeycomb lattice structure [1] . Due to its unique electronic properties such as high carrier mobility [2] , large specific surface area [3] , thermal conductivity [4] , mechanical flexibility [5] , chemical stability [6] and biocompatibility [7, 8] , this material has attracted considerable attention over recent years [9] . However, despite these advantages, there have been some challenges associated with the use of pristine graphene sheets due to their hydrophobic nature [10] which limits their applications [11] . Therefore, many efforts have been made towards modifying the physical and chemical characteristics of graphene through various approaches including covalent [12] or non-covalent [13] functionalization [14] .\n \nIn particular, non-covalent functionalization can be achieved via \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions [15] , hydrogen bonding [16] , electrostatic [17] , van der Waals [18] and ionic [19] forces [20] . Among them, \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking is considered to be the strongest noncovalent force [21] .

We find that these galaxies are predominantly blue (with median color u \u2212 g = -0.5), have low stellar masses (10^9 Msun\/pc^2) and high specific star formation rates (sSFR ~ 10^-2 Gyr-1). These properties suggest they represent a recently assembled population of star-forming dwarf galaxies that were accreted by their host clusters during recent mergers.

We consider all possible consistent models in this class that are free of tachyons at tree level and have vanishing one-loop cosmological constant. The number of such models is estimated by counting the number of inequivalent ways of embedding the gauge group into the Narain lattice. For each model we compute its massless spectrum using the freely available software package SARAH. In particular, we determine whether there exist chiral exotics charged under both Standard Model groups SU(3)c xSU(2)L xU(1)Y as well as non-chiral exotics charged only under U(1)Y . Finally, for each model we calculate the value of the lightest Higgs boson mass Mhh , which can be used to compare our results against future experimental data. \n \n Introduction \n \n String theory has been proposed as a candidate theory beyond the standard model of particle physics. One of the main goals of theoretical research within string phenomenology is to find realistic vacua where the Standard Model particles live together with their superpartners. This requires finding solutions to the so-called moduli stabilisation problem, i.e., stabilising the extra spatial dimensions so that they do not grow large compared to the size of the observable universe. A promising approach towards solving this problem is to use fluxes threading internal cycles of Calabi-Yau manifolds [1] .\n \nIn recent years it became clear that many different types of string theories lead to similar low-energy effective field theories [2] .

We use an axisymmetric, general relativistic hydrodynamic code to evolve the equations for mass and momentum conservation with self-gravity included. The initial conditions are taken as those of steady-state discs around Kerr black holes. In order to mimic GRB outflows we add a radial velocity perturbation at large radii which is then advected inward by the fluid. This leads to the development of spiral density waves which grow exponentially on a dynamical timescale. These waves can be identified with the Rossby wave instability (RWI) predicted analytically by Lovelace et al. (1999) . They also lead to the formation of shocks near the inner edge of the disc where they steepen into strong discontinuities. As these shocks propagate outward through the disc their strength decreases due to dissipation."}

The LAT instrument on board Fermi consists of four identical towers each containing 16 silicon strip trackers surrounded by tungsten converters followed by CsI(Tl) scintillators. Each tracker module has a thickness of 1 cm and contains 12 layers of silicon strips oriented at different angles relative to one another. This design allows for accurate measurement of both the direction and energy of incident photons. In addition, there are two calorimeter sections located behind the tracker modules which contain 8 planes of CsI(Tl).

The results presented here can be used by experimental collaborations to improve their theoretical predictions. \n \n Introduction \n \n The discovery of the Higgs boson [1-3] has been confirmed recently [4] . However, its properties still need to be measured with high precision in order to test whether it corresponds to the scalar particle predicted within the Standard Model (SM). This measurement will require an accurate knowledge of both the total production rate and differential distributions of the Higgs boson produced via gluon fusion [5-7] , bb annihilation [8-10] and vector-boson-fusion [11-13] processes. These calculations have been performed so far using fixed-order perturbation theory [14-21] .\n \nIn recent years there has been significant progress towards improving perturbative QCD calculations beyond leading order [22-31] .

The second method relies on the analysis of sunspot number time series using wavelet transform. This approach allows us to identify periodicities in the signal related to the solar activity. Our results show that both approaches are able to make accurate predictions about the upcoming solar cycle. Solar activity exhibits cyclic behavior over multiple timescales ranging from minutes up to thousands years. Understanding these cycles can help us better understand how the Sun works as well as its influence on Earths climate. \n \n Predicting the strength and duration of forthcoming solar cycles is one of the most challenging problems in space weather research.

{"text":"We present an efficient algorithm to simulate the dynamics of nonlinear systems with arbitrary initial conditions and parameters using fast recursive filters (FRFs). The FRF is based on a linear combination of basis functions, which are obtained by solving a set of ordinary differential equations that represent the model under consideration.

In particular we demonstrate our approach on two examples, namely the Lorenz attractor and the FitzHugh-Nagumo neuron model. \nI. INTRODUCTIO N\nThe simulation of complex dynamical systems often requires the solution of sets of coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs) [1] . For example, many models describing physical phenomena involve ODEs [2] , while other applications include chemical reactions [3] , population growth [4] , epidemiology [5] , neuroscience [6] , climate modeling [7] , etc.. However, even if these problems have been studied extensively [8] - [10] , there still exist several challenges associated with their computational treatment [11] .\nIn general, it is not possible to solve analytically the ODE system representing the problem at hand [12] . Therefore, one has to resort to approximate solutions [13] . These approximations may be obtained either numerically [14] or symbolically [15] . Numerical approaches typically rely on discretizing the continuous-time domain into small segments [16] . This leads to a discrete representation of the original system [17] , where each segment corresponds to a single state variable [18] .

We use these results to investigate whether any of them are likely to be false positives due to blending with nearby stars or other effects such as grazing eclipses.  The majority of the planet detections have been made using ground-based telescopes which cannot resolve individual sources in crowded fields. This means that it is possible that some of the detected signals may actually arise from multiple unresolved objects rather than single planets. In addition, there can also be significant contamination from background eclipsing binaries whose light curves mimic those expected from planetary systems. To address this problem we perform detailed simulations of each system taking into account realistic distributions of stellar masses and distances, as well as observing conditions at different sites."}

The first type is characterized by its high degree of genuine multipartite entanglement while the second one has only low degrees of it.

One important aspect of quantum information processing is the ability to generate highly entangled states between many parties [2] , which may be used to perform various tasks including teleportation [3] , dense coding [4] , remote state preparation [5] , etc.. However, due to decoherence [6] , it is very difficult to maintain the coherence of quantum states over large distances [7, 8] .\nIn recent years, much attention has been paid to studying the generation of entanglement in condensed matter physics [9] - [11] . Many physical models have been proposed to describe the behavior of real materials [12] - [14] . Among them, the Heisenberg model [15] plays an important role because it describes the interaction among spins [16] . Recently, several authors studied the effect of anisotropic exchange interactions [17] - [20] and external magnetic fields [21] - [23] on the entanglement properties of Heisenberg spin chains. They found that the anisotropic exchange interactions and external magnetic fields could significantly change the entanglement structure of the system. For example, Ref. [24] showed that"}

{"text":"We present new results on the star formation rate (SFR) in galaxies with active galactic nuclei (AGN). We use deep Spitzer Space Telescope observations to study the infrared luminosity function and SFR density evolution for AGNs selected by their mid-infrared colors, which are known to be dominated by dust heated by young stars. The observed infrared luminosities range over four orders of magnitude, from 10^42 erg\/sec to more than 10^45 erg\/sec. Our sample includes both obscured quasars and unobscured type-1 Seyferts out to redshifts z = 3.5. We find that the infrared luminosity functions of these two populations evolve similarly as a function of redshift, but differ significantly when compared locally. This suggests that the physical processes responsible for heating the dust may not change dramatically between high-z and low-z systems, while the fraction of AGNs surrounded by massive amounts of dust does decrease rapidly with time."}
{"text":"We generalize the notion of circle to arbitrary fields, and show that this generalization is equivalent to the usual one in characteristic zero. We also give an explicit description for the field of definition of such generalized circles. This work was done as part of my PhD thesis at ETH Zurich under supervision of Prof. Dr. Jens S\u00f6ring. The results presented here are taken from my thesis [1] . \nIntroduction\n\nIn mathematics, a circle (or disc) is defined by its center point and radius. In particular, if we fix two points $P_1 = (x_1, y_1), P_2 = (x_2, y_2)$ on the plane, then the set $C = \\{(x,y) | d((x,y), (P_1, P_2)) \\leq r\\}$ with some fixed $r > 0$ forms a circle around $P_1$ and $P_2$. \nThe most common way to define a circle is via the equation $(x-x_0)^2 + (y-y_0)^2 = r^2$ where $x_0$ and $y_0$ denote the coordinates of the center and $r$ denotes the radius. However, it turns out that there exist other ways to describe a circle which do not involve any parameters like center or radius. For example, consider the following statement:"}
{"text":"We present new photometry for the globular cluster NGC 1904, obtained with the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) on board HST in four filters spanning the optical and near-infrared wavelength range. We find that this cluster has an extended blue horizontal branch (BHB), which is populated by both hot BHBs and blue stragglers (BSs). In order to study these populations separately we use two different methods. First, we select stars based on their location along the red giant branch (RGB); secondly, we perform artificial star tests using our best-fit model CMD as input. Both approaches yield consistent results. Our analysis shows that the fraction of BSs among all evolved stars amounts to f = 0.11 \u00b1 0.01. This value agrees well with previous studies of other clusters. Using theoretical models we estimate the age of the cluster at t = 12 Gyr."}
{"text":"We study the distribution of the largest fragment in a fragmentation process, which is an important quantity for understanding how to optimize data transmission over networks and storage systems.  We show that this distribution can be approximated by a power law with exponent 1 + 1\/(2 - p), where p is the probability that two fragments merge into one when they are adjacent on disk (the so-called \"mergeability parameter\"). This result explains why previous studies have found different exponents depending on whether or not merging was allowed. The approximation also allows us to derive closed-form expressions for other quantities such as the mean size of the largest fragment and its variance. Finally, we use our results to explain some recent experimental findings about file sizes in peer-to-peer systems. In many applications involving data transmission over networks and distributed storage systems, it is useful to understand how large the largest fragment will become during the course of the system's evolution. For example, if a network node has to transmit a certain amount of information within a given time limit, then knowing what fraction of the total data needs to be transmitted at any point in time may help improve performance. Similarly, in distributed storage systems, knowing the expected size of the largest fragment helps determine how much space each node should reserve for storing replicas."}
{"text":"We present an analysis of gravitational lensing data for the galaxy cluster Abell 1689, which is located at redshift z = 0.183 and has been observed by Hubble Space Telescope (HST) in three bands (F450W, F625W, F775W). We use these observations to reconstruct the intrinsic triaxial shape of this massive cluster using two different methods. First we apply the method developed by Sereno & Umetsu (2006) , where the projected mass distribution on the sky is modeled as a superposition of elliptical NFW halos with varying axial ratios. Second, we employ the technique proposed by Corless et al. (2009), where the three-dimensional density profile is described by a generalized Navarro-Frenk-White model. Both models are fitted simultaneously to the HST shear measurements obtained within a circular aperture centered on the brightest cluster galaxy. The best-fit parameters inferred from both approaches agree well with each other."}
{"text":"We have performed molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the dynamic crack propagation in an icosahedral AlPdMn quasicrystal and its periodic approximant, i-AlCuFe. The results show that both materials exhibit similar features for the crack growth process at low temperatures (T = 300 K). However, there are significant differences between them when T is increased up to 600 K. In particular, we find that the quasicrystal shows a higher resistance against crack propagation than the approximant under tensile loading conditions. This behavior can be explained by considering the different atomic structures of these two systems. \n \n We also studied how the temperature affects the mechanical properties of the quasicrystal. Our results indicate that increasing the temperature leads to a decrease in the elastic constants C11 and C44 as well as in the bulk modulus B. Moreover, our calculations reveal that the Young's moduli E decreases with increasing temperature."}
{"text":"The Neutrino Factory and Muon Collider Collaboration (NFMCC), in collaboration with other European laboratories is proposing an innovative concept for a large liquid argon imaging detector that will be used as part of the future Neutrino Factory or Muon Collider experiments at CERN.

{"text":"We present an analysis of dislocation structures in icosahedral approximant phases based on a new approach to describing dislocation networks, which is applicable both to periodic crystals and aperiodic solids with any kind of local order. The method relies on projecting the Burgers vectors onto a set of basis vectors that are determined by the underlying lattice structure. We show how this can be used to describe the dislocation network in the decagonal phase of the AlPdMn system as well as its parent cubic phase. In particular we find that the dislocation network in these two phases has very similar characteristics despite the fact that they have different symmetries. This suggests that the dislocation network may play an important role in determining the physical properties of these materials. \n \n Introduction \n \n Dislocations are line defects in crystalline materials where there is a discontinuity in the atomic arrangement along some direction. They occur naturally during plastic deformation processes such as bending or stretching but also arise spontaneously when certain conditions are satisfied [1] . For example, it was recently shown that dislocations form at grain boundaries between grains of differing orientations [2] , and that they can even appear within single grains [3] .\n \nDislocations are classified according to their Burgers vector b = mu + nv (where u and v are primitive lattice vectors) into edge dislocations if m+n=0, screw dislocations if n=m=1, mixed dislocations otherwise [4] . Edge dislocations correspond to a displacement field perpendicular to the slip plane while screw dislocations give rise to a displacement parallel to the slip plane [5] . Mixed dislocations combine features of both types [6] . \n \nThe presence of dislocations leads to elastic strain fields around them [7, 8] . These strains can be calculated using the Peach-Koehler force acting on each individual dislocation [9] . If all dislocations were isolated then the total energy would simply be given by the sum over all contributions from individual dislocations [10] . However, in real systems dislocations interact strongly with one another through elastic interactions [11] . As a result, the total energy depends not only on the number density"}
{"text":"We present the results of our photometric and spectroscopic study of the blue plume (BP) stars in four nearby dwarf spheroidal galaxies, Draco, Ursa Minor, Sculptor, and Carina. The BP is defined as an excess over the main sequence turn-off at B \u2212 V = 0.4 mag for metal-poor populations with [Fe\/H] < \u22121 dex. We find that the BPs are composed of two distinct components; one component follows the same color-magnitude relation as Galactic globular clusters while another component shows bluer colors than expected by theoretical models. Our analysis suggests that these two components have different origins. One possibility is that they represent a mixture of old and intermediate-age populations. Another possibility is that the bluer component represents a younger generation of stars formed during recent star formation events. In this case, we expect to see some evidence of ongoing star formation activity such as H\u03b1 emission lines and\/or UV upturn features. However, no clear signatures of ongoing star formation were found among the BP stars. \n \n Instead, we propose that the bluer component may be explained by binary evolution effects on the horizontal branch. If so, then the BP can be used as a tracer of binary fraction in low-metallicity environments."}
{"text":"We present an ab initio study of the electronic and magnetic structure of volborthite, CaFe3(PO4)2(OH)3\u00b7H2O (CFPOH), which is one of the most important minerals in geological sciences as it forms at low temperatures under hydrothermal conditions. Volborthite has been studied extensively by neutron scattering experiments but its microscopic origin remains controversial. We show that the ground state of CFPOH can be described within density functional theory using the generalized gradient approximation plus Hubbard U method for Fe-3d orbitals. The calculated spin wave spectrum agrees well with experimental data obtained by inelastic neutron scattering measurements. In addition we find that the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy is dominated by spin-orbit coupling effects. Finally, we discuss how our results are related to previous theoretical studies based on different approximations. V olborthite, CaF e 3 (P O 4 ) 2 (OH) 3 \u00b7H 2 O (C F P OH ), is one of the most impor-tant minerals in geological sciences because it forms at low tem-peratures under hydrothermal conditions [1] . It was first discovered in 1832 [2] , however, only recently have detailed structural investigations revealed that this mineral belongs to the family of compounds known as \"Kagome\" materials [3] .\nVolborthite crystallizes into a layered structure consisting of alternating kagome planes of iron ions and phosphate groups [4] . This arrangement leads to interesting physical phenomena such as geometric frustration [5] or quantum fluctuations [6] . For example, recent neutron scattering experiments suggest that volborthite undergoes a phase transition below T N = 5 K [7, 8] where the spins order ferrimagnetically along the c-axis [9] . However, there exists no consensus about the nature of this ordering [10] : while some authors claim that the system orders collinearly [11, 12] others argue that non-collinearity plays an essential role [13, 14] ."}
{"text":"We study the ground state properties of an interacting electron gas confined to a onedimensional (1D) quantum dot with parabolic confinement potential and repulsive Coulomb interaction between electrons. We show that, for sufficiently strong confining potential, the system undergoes a phase transition into a deformed Wigner crystal at low temperatures. The results are obtained by using density functional theory within the local spin-density approximation combined with exact diagonalization method. In this regime, we find that the charge distribution is characterized by alternating peaks separated by valleys which become more pronounced as temperature decreases. This behavior can be understood in terms of formation of a periodic structure due to inter-particle correlations. Our results suggest that such structures may exist experimentally in semiconductor nanowires or carbon nanotubes. Introduction:-In recent years there has been considerable interest in studying the electronic properties of nanostructures [1] . One dimensional systems have attracted particular attention because they provide a unique opportunity to investigate fundamental physical phenomena like Luttinger liquid [2] , fractional statistics [3] , and Wigner crystallization [4] .\nTheoretical studies of 1D quantum dots (QDs), i.e., QDs with only one dimension much smaller than other two dimensions, were first carried out by Lieb et al [5] who showed that these systems exhibit interesting features including shell filling effects [6] . Subsequently, several authors studied various aspects of QD physics [7, 8] . For example, it was shown that the energy spectrum of a QD depends strongly on its shape [9] . It also turns out that the single particle wave functions of a QD depend sensitively on the boundary conditions [10] . Recently, some experimental progress has been made towards realizing 1D QDs [11] - [13] . However, most experiments so far have focused mainly on transport measurements [14] - [16] rather than direct imaging [17] . Therefore, theoretical investigations play an important role in understanding the underlying physics of these systems [18] - [20] .\nIn this work, we consider a model consisting of N non-interacting fermions confined to a 1D QD with parabolic confinement potential V(x).

{"text":"We study the possibility that gravitational waves can be detected by measuring their effect on gyroscopes in space, as proposed for the GP-B experiment. We consider two classes of models with torsion and show how they affect the motion of test particles around spinning black holes. In one class we find that there is no effect at all; this includes Einstein-Cartan theory (with or without fermions) and teleparallel gravity. The other class contains some effects but these are too small to be detectable even if the spin of the black hole were known exactly. However, it may still be possible to detect such effects using future experiments like LISA. Finally, we discuss whether any of our results could have been anticipated within general relativity. This work was supported by NSF grant PHY-0456747. Gravitational waves will produce tiny changes in the orientation of gyroscopes carried into space by satellites. These changes should be measurable by comparing the orientations of pairs of gyroscopes separated by large distances. Such an experiment has recently begun taking data [1] . It is called Gravity Probe B (GP-B), after its predecessor which measured the precession of the earth's orbit [2] .\nIn this Letter we investigate what information about gravitational waves might be obtained from measurements made by GP-B. Our main focus is on theories containing torsion -the antisymmetric part of the connection [3, 4] , which plays a role similar to electromagnetism in standard general relativity [5] . Torsion arises naturally in many extensions of general relativity [6] ; however, it also appears in certain modified versions of general relativity [7, 8] . For example, in string-inspired supergravity [9] , torsion couples directly to matter fields [10] ."}

{"text":"We study the dynamics of string cosmologies with nontrivial dilaton potentials, focusing on their chaotic behavior. We show that for certain classes of potentials there are regions where trajectories can be trapped by unstable fixed points or periodic orbits. In these cases we find that the system is not ergodic but has an infinite number of attractors which correspond to different values of the Hubble parameter H(t). The existence of such attractor solutions may have important consequences for the evolution of our universe. For example, it could explain why the present value of H(t) differs so much from its initial value at t = 0. It also provides a possible explanation for the observed flatness problem since the volume V (t) grows exponentially fast during inflation while the energy density decreases as 1\/V (t).\nThe results presented here were obtained using numerical methods based on the fourth-order Runge-Kutta algorithm combined with Newton's method for finding roots."}

{"text":"We study supersymmetric Landau-Lifshitz models in two dimensions with an arbitrary number $N$ of scalar fields. We show that these theories are dual to superconformal field theories on $AdS_3\\times S^1$ with $N-1$ vector multiplets and one hypermultiplet. The latter is charged under the $U(1)$ gauge group associated with the Kaluza-Klein reduction along the circle direction. This provides new examples for the AdS\/CFT duality beyond those previously known. In particular we find that the theory has a rich phase structure depending on the values of the coupling constants. For some special values of the couplings there exist additional massless states which correspond to BPS saturated strings stretching between the boundary and the horizon of the black hole solution. These results can be generalized to higher dimensional cases as well. Supersymmetry plays important roles both in particle physics and string theory. It is therefore interesting to explore its possible realizations in various physical systems. One particularly successful approach towards this goal is the so-called AdS\/CFT correspondence [1] . According to it, N = 4 Super-Yang-Mills (SYM) theory living on the boundary of anti-de-Sitter space-time (AdS5) is equivalent to type IIB supergravity or superstrings propagating in ten-dimensional curved backgrounds [2] .\nIn recent years much attention was paid to studying non-supersymmetric deformations of the original SYM\/SUGRA setup [3] - [8] , see also [9] - [11] . However, less work has been done so far on exploring supersymmetric extensions of the AdS\/CFT dictionary [12] - [17] . In fact, most of the existing studies have focused on constructing explicit solutions of the corresponding bulk gravity\/string equations [18] - [20] . On the other hand, only few attempts were made to analyze the properties of the resulting quantum field theories [21] - [23] ."}

{"text":"We study the phase behavior of a system of N identical hard rods confined to a square box with periodic boundary conditions, using Monte Carlo simulations at constant pressure P . We find that for sufficiently large values of P , there is an ordered state where all particles are aligned along one direction (the x-axis), forming layers perpendicular to this axis.  The transition between disordered and ordered states occurs via a first-order phase transition which we characterize by studying the density profiles across the simulation cell as well as the order parameter distribution function. For small values of P , however, no such ordered state exists. Instead, the system exhibits a glassy dynamics characterized by slow relaxation timescales. Finally, we show how our results can be used to explain recent experiments on colloidal suspensions under shear flow. In many physical systems, it has been observed that particles tend to align themselves into regular patterns when they interact strongly enough. This phenomenon is known as capillarity [1] or self-assembly [2] .\nIn particular, in two dimensions, particles may form stripes [3] - [5] , squares [6] , hexagons [7] , or even more complex structures [8] depending on their shape [9] , size [10] , interactions [11] , and external fields [12] .

{"text":"We have performed neutron powder diffraction experiments on the intermetallic compound Sm2IrIn8 in order to determine its magnetic structure and compare it with that proposed for YbMgGaO4, another member of this family of compounds.

This is similar to what was found previously for YbMgGaO4 but different than the theoretical prediction based on band-structure calculations which suggested that the ordered moment should be perpendicular to the c-axis.  We also find evidence for a structural phase transition near T* ~ 80 K where there are changes in both the lattice parameters as well as the unit cell volume. These results suggest that the low temperature crystal structure may not correspond exactly to the high-temperature tetragonal symmetry predicted by theory.

We use lattice QCD data obtained with Nf = 2 + 1 flavors of dynamical quarks and an improved gauge action at three different values of the lattice spacing, corresponding to about 0.1 fm, 0.06 fm and 0.04 fm respectively. The light quark masses range between m\u03c0\/\u039bQCD=0.2 and m\u03c0\/\u039bQGP =0.4 where \u039bQCD is the scale parameter determined by the lattice regularization scheme used here. In order to extract physical observables we perform fits to the lattice data using HBChPT up to next-to-leading order (NLO) including finite volume effects as well as discretization errors. Our analysis shows that the inclusion of higher orders in the expansion leads to significant changes in the numerical value of the scattering lengths: while the leading-order result agrees within error bars with previous determinations based on continuum calculations, our final result differs significantly from these earlier estimates."}
{"text":"We present an analysis of the observed distribution of the magnetic field geometries for stars across the upper main sequence (UMS). We use data on the projected surface magnetic fields and rotation periods, as well as stellar parameters derived by spectroscopic observations, to determine the fraction of oblique rotators among UMS stars with different masses and ages. The results are compared with predictions based on dynamo models that include effects of differential rotation. \n \n In our sample we find that the fraction of obliquely rotating stars increases towards lower masses: it is about 50% for F-type dwarfs but only 20% for G-type giants. This trend can be explained if the large-scale magnetic fields generated by dynamos operating at the base of convective envelopes become more complex during evolution along the red giant branch. Our findings also suggest that the fraction of obliquely-rotating stars decreases with age. For example, this fraction is higher than 80% for young open clusters such as NGC 2516 or Pleiades, while it drops below 40% for old open clusters like M67."}

The ACS coronagraph was used to block out direct stellar radiation at small angular separations from the central star while allowing us to detect scattered light from circumstellar material located farther away. We find evidence for two bright rings of emission separated by ~0.5\u2032\u2032 along the major axis of the disk. These features are most likely due to scattering off large grains or planetesimals orbiting close to their parent stars. \n \n In addition, we have detected several dark gaps within these bright rings as well as fainter structures extending outward into the outer regions of the disk.

{"text":"We present the canonical quantization of topologically massive gauge theories in any dimension, including the case of non-abelian gauge fields coupled to fermions. We show that these models are equivalent to gauge-invariant factorised formalisms which have been used previously for studying such systems. In particular we demonstrate how this equivalence can be exploited to obtain exact results for correlation functions at finite temperature using functional methods. This formalism is also applicable to other quantum field theories with massless particles and an associated topological term. It may therefore prove useful as a general tool for investigating strongly interacting systems where conventional perturbative techniques fail. Introduction:-The study of quantum field theory has led to many important insights into fundamental physics over recent decades. However it remains difficult to solve exactly even simple problems involving interactions between elementary particles due to their nonperturbative nature. One approach to tackling this problem involves exploiting symmetries inherent within certain classes of model systems; in particular supersymmetry (SUSY) provides powerful constraints on the possible forms of particle interaction and leads to significant simplifications when applied to specific physical situations [1] . Another promising technique exploits the fact that some quantum field theories possess additional global or local symmetries which allow them to be expressed in terms of simpler effective descriptions known as \"gauge-invariant factorisations\" [2] , see e.g. [3] - [6] .\nIn this work we consider a class of quantum field theories whose Lagrangians contain both a standard kinetic energy term and a so-called 'topological' contribution arising from the coupling of the gauge field to itself [7, 8] . These theories include Yang-Mills-Higgs models [9] , Chern-Simons-matter theories [10] , and more recently proposed extensions [11] - [13] . They play an important role in condensed matter physics [14] , string theory [15] , and cosmology [16] . Despite being relatively simple they exhibit rich behaviour; for example they support excitations with fractional statistics [17] and provide examples of parity-violating phases [18] .

{"text":"The development of large space telescopes requires the use of lightweight materials to reduce launch costs and increase telescope performance in orbit. Silicon Carbide (SiC) is an excellent candidate material due to its high strength, low density, and radiation hardness at cryogenic temperatures. However, it has been shown that SiC exhibits significant changes in thermal expansion with temperature which can lead to dimensional instability during cool-downs or warm-ups. This work presents results on the measurement of the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of SiC-100 over a wide range of temperatures using a novel technique based on laser interferometry. The measured values are compared against literature data as well as theoretical predictions obtained by ab initio calculations. It was found that the experimental measurements agree very well with theory within the uncertainty limits. These results will be used to improve the design of future space missions such as JWST and WFIRST-AFTA."}

The observations were made with Suzaku satellite, which has an unprecedented combination of high sensitivity and energy resolution at 6.4 keV for mCVs. We detected significant excess emission above continuum around 6.4 keV in three out of four targets observed. This is interpreted as Compton-scattered line photons produced in the accretion disk coronae surrounding white dwarfs.

{"text":"Superhumps are periodic modulations in the light curves of some cataclysmic variables (CVs). They have been observed to occur during both the high and low states, but their origin is still not understood. In this work we present comprehensive numerical simulations of CVs with mass ratios q = 0.7-0.9 that include tidal dissipation effects as well as magnetic braking. We find that for systems with orbital periods P orb < 3 hr, the inclusion of magnetic braking leads to an increase in the amplitude of the superhumps by up to a factor of two compared to previous results obtained without magnetic braking. For longer period systems, however, our models predict smaller amplitudes than those inferred observationally.

In addition to their gravitational effects on the LSS, we find that they also produce non-gravitational signatures such as: i) anisotropic pressure gradients; ii) bulk motions; iii) temperature fluctuations; iv) magnetic fields. These effects may have important consequences for our understanding of the formation and evolution of large-scale structures. The detection of these phenomena will provide new insights into the physics behind cosmic acceleration. \n \n Keywords: Cosmology, Cosmic Acceleration, Dark Matter Halos, Weak Gravitational Lensing, Galaxy Clusters \n \n \n \n 1 Introduction \n \n Recent observational data suggest that the expansion history of the Universe is accelerating at late times [1\u20133] .

{"text":"We study the critical current density Jc(B) for type-II superconductors with broken translational symmetry, such as vortex glass and Bose glass states. We show that Jc(B) is determined by the superfluid stiffness $\\rho_s$ at zero magnetic field through the relation $$J_c = \\rho_s \/ \\mu_0$$ where $\\mu_0$ is the vacuum permeability. This result explains why Jc(B) decreases rapidly when the system enters into the vortex glass state or the Bose glass state. The present theory also predicts that Jc(B), which has been observed experimentally, should be proportional to the square root of the number of vortices per unit volume. Finally we discuss how our results can be tested experimentally. Introduction:-The critical current density Jc (the maximum supercurrent density allowed before the transition to normal state occurs) plays an important role in determining many physical properties of type-II superconductors [1] . For example, it determines the upper limit of the operating temperature Tmax of high-Tc cuprate superconductors [2] , and thus limits their applications [3] .\nIn this Letter, we will show that Jc depends on the superfluid stiffness \u03c1s at zero magnetic field via the relation Jc=\u03c1s\/\u03bc0 [4] , where \u03bc0 is the vacuum permeability. In particular, if there are no defects in the sample, then Jc increases linearly with decreasing temperature below Tc until it reaches its maximum value Jc0=\u03c1s\/\u03bc0 at T=0K [5] . However, if there exist some defects in the sample, e.g., point-like impurities [6] , dislocations [7] , grain boundaries [8] , etc., then Jc decreases rapidly upon entering into the vortex-glass phase [9] or the Bose-glass phase [10] . These predictions have been confirmed by experiments [11] - [13] . \nModel:-To calculate Jc, we consider a two-dimensional model described by the following Hamiltonian:-"}
{"text":"We study the effect of rounding on the dynamics of complex networks with first-order phase transition (FPT). We show that FPTs can be rounded by adding or removing nodes, which leads to an increase in the number of cooperators at equilibrium. The results are obtained for both static and dynamic models of evolution of cooperation. In particular, we find that the presence of FPTs is necessary but not sufficient condition for high levels of cooperation. Finally, we propose a simple strategy for finding the best possible roundings leading to maximal level of cooperation. Rounding of first-order phase transistions and optimal cooperation in scale free networks. P. Krawczyk 1 , A. Szolnoki 2 . \n1 Institute of Physics, University of Warsaw, Poland; krawczykp@wip.waw.pl .\n2 Department of Mathematics, University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland; aszolnok@wip. waw.pl .\nIn this work we investigate how the presence of first order phase transitions affects the evolution of cooperation in social dilemmas. First, we introduce two new concepts -the minimal and the maximal cooperative states-which describe the range of values of parameters where cooperation prevails over defection. Then, using these definitions, we prove that any system with first order phase transition has its own unique value of parameter corresponding to the maximum fraction of cooperators. Next, we consider the problem of optimizing cooperation in such systems. To do so, we define the concept of \"rounding\" of first order phase transitions, i.e., changing their shape into smooth curves without affecting the position of the point of maximum fraction of cooperators within the interval [0, 1]. Using numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the rounding procedure increases the fraction of cooperators at equilibrium in all studied cases. Finally, we present a method allowing one to determine the optimal rounding of given phase transition curve."}
{"text":"In this work, we study the dynamics of discrete nonholonomic systems with symmetry in terms of their associated Lie groupoids and develop an algorithm for computing the solutions to these equations numerically.  We consider a class of discrete mechanical systems whose configuration space is a Lie group G equipped with left-invariant Riemannian metric $\\langle \\cdot ,\\cdot \\rangle$. The system evolves by applying a sequence of local diffeomorphisms $T_k :G \\to G$ that are generated by vector fields $X_k \\in \\mathfrak{g}$ satisfying the condition $[X_k,X_l] = 0$ for all $k \\neq l$. These transformations preserve the metric structure of $G$ but do not necessarily preserve its volume form. In order to define the notion of energy conservation for such systems, we introduce the concept of a generalized momentum map which assigns to each transformation $T_k$ a linear operator $P_k : T_eG \\to T_eG$ where $e$ denotes the identity element of $G$. This allows us to define the total energy as the sum of kinetic energies at every step of the evolution process."}

The results show that the pseudogap opens up around half-filling for all values of U studied here (U = 2 \u2212 8t). At higher dopings we observe a dome-like structure which becomes more pronounced as U increases. In addition to this feature, we also see another peak in DOS near the Fermi level which corresponds to the onset of CDW order. This second peak disappears when temperature is increased or doping decreases.

{"text":"We present Spitzer mid-infrared spectroscopy for eight quasars at redshifts z ~ 2-6 with luminosities ranging over four orders of magnitude (10^44-10^47 erg\/s). We find that the dust covering factors are similar to those found in lower-luminosity AGN but systematically higher than expected based on models of quasar host galaxies. The observed infrared SEDs can be reproduced by assuming an additional component of hot dust heated directly by the central engine. This is consistent with recent results suggesting that the majority of obscuring material lies outside the broad-line region. In addition we detect strong PAH features which suggest that these objects have experienced significant episodes of star formation within their hosts. These observations provide new insights into how supermassive black holes grow during the peak epoch of galaxy assembly. Quasars play a key role in understanding the growth of supermassive black holes as well as the evolution of massive galaxies. However, despite extensive observational efforts it remains unclear what physical processes drive this rapid growth. One possible explanation is that gas accreting onto the black hole fuels both nuclear activity and intense star-formation in the surrounding host galaxy. Recent studies show that most quasars reside in massive elliptical galaxies or bulges of spiral galaxies (e.g., McLure & Dunlop 2004) where they may trigger bursts of star formation through interactions between the radio jets and interstellar medium (e.g., Nesvadba et al. 2006) . It has also been suggested that mergers could lead to enhanced levels of star formation in the host galaxy prior to the onset of quasar activity (Sanders et al. 1988; Hopkins et al. 2008 ). An alternative scenario suggests that quasars evolve rapidly via Eddington-limited accretion flows (Soltan 1982) , while the bulk of the obscuration arises from circumnuclear torii located close to the central engine (Antonucci 1993) .\nIn order to understand the connection between active galactic nuclei (AGNs), starbursts and galaxy evolution, it is important to study high-z quas"}

The main conclusions are summarised below:-The predicted number counts at 24 microns agree well with those measured by Spitzer\/MIPS over most of the range probed by SINGS. -Our model predicts too few low-luminosity galaxies compared to the observations; however, these systems may not have been detected due to their extremely faint flux levels. -The predicted distribution of dust temperatures agrees reasonably well with the observations although there appears to be an excess of cold dusty galaxies in the simulations relative to what is seen in the data. -The predicted relationship between far-infrared colour and total infrared luminosity agrees fairly well with the observations but shows signs of being slightly steeper than suggested by the data."}

In addition, it has been shown how these elements may be combined with an iterative solution technique known as GMRES(m). This combination allows solutions which are nearly exact to be obtained without any loss of efficiency over conventional BEM approaches using quadrilateral elements.

{"text":"We study theoretically the influence of longitudinal magnetic fields in coronal loops on the damping rate of small amplitude prominence oscillations. We find that for sufficiently large values of the longitudinal magnetic field, the damping is dominated by resonant absorption and it increases with increasing longitudinal magnetic field strength. For smaller values of the longitudinal magnetic fields we find that the damping is due to phase mixing between Alfv\u00e9n waves propagating along neighboring flux tubes. In this case the damping decreases as the longitudinal magnetic field becomes weaker. The results are compared with observations made at the Solar Ultraviolet Measurements of Emitted Radiation (SUMER) instrument aboard SOHO spacecraft. It has been known since the early 1980s that many prominences exhibit periodic transverse displacements which can be observed both in H\u03b1 images and in EUV lines formed higher up in the atmosphere than H\u03b1 . These motions have periods ranging from several minutes down to about one minute and amplitudes typically less than 100 km s-1 .\nTheoretical models suggest that these oscillations may be driven by slow magnetoacoustic waves trapped inside the prominence body or by fast kink modes excited by photospheric flows (see e.g., Oliver & Ballester 1994; Terradas et al. 2002) .

The first method is based on the matched filter technique developed for X-ray surveys (Postman et al 1996) , while the second one uses a friends-of-friends algorithm applied directly to the galaxy distribution. In order to test our selection algorithms we compare them against mock galaxy clusters extracted from N-body simulations. Our main results are as follows:  1.

For example, the ground-state wavefunction of strongly correlated fermions on lattices can be written as a product of local singlet pairs known as valence bonds [12] . This class of states is called valence-bond solid (VBS) states [13] . It was later found that VBS states can also be represented by so-called valence bond basis [14] . These states include the famous N\u00e9el state [15] describing antiferromagnetic order [16] , the Haldane phase [17] corresponding to integer-spin chains [18] , and the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT) model [19] representing gapped spin-1\/2 chain [20] . \n \n Recently, several schemes [21]- [23] were proposed to generate these types of quantum states experimentally. However, all existing proposals require nonlinear interactions among photons [24] and\/or complicated setups [25] . Therefore, they cannot be implemented easily in practice. On the other hand, some experimental demonstrations [26] - [28] have been performed recently to produce photonic qubits [29] .

We show that under some mild conditions on the model selection procedure, one can estimate the conditional distribution of such an estimator by using its bootstrap counterpart. Then, we propose to use kernel density estimation techniques for estimating the unconditional distribution based on these conditional distributions. Finally, we provide simulation results which demonstrate the performance of our proposed method.

For example, suppose that we are interested in making inference about the mean vector $\\mu$ of a multivariate normal population $\\mathcal{N}_p(\\mu, \\Sigma)$ where $p$ denotes the dimension of the data set. If we have a large number of candidate covariance matrices ${\\displaystyle \\Sigma}$, then we may want to select the best covariance matrix among them via some model selection criterion such as AIC or BIC before proceeding further. However, if we do not know how to choose between two competing covariance matrices, then we need to develop methods for making inferences about $\\mu$ without knowing the true covariance structure. This situation arises frequently when dealing with high-dimensional data sets since there usually exist infinitely many possible covariance structures even though only a small fraction of them are plausible candidates."}

The observed flux changes are consistent with those expected if these objects have relativistic jets which precess around their axes at small angles to our line-of-sight. In addition we detect rapid flaring activity in the soft X-rays during one observation of each source. This is most likely due to thermal instabilities within the accretion disk.

We show how this scenario can be realized in supersymmetric theories with extra dimensions and discuss its phenomenological consequences for neutrino physics. \n \n In particular we consider the case where the lepton number violating interactions are localized on a brane at y = 0 while the Standard Model fields live in the bulk. The resulting mass matrix has two zero eigenvalues corresponding to the light active neutrinos and one massive eigenvalue m ~ 10 GeV associated with the sterile neutrino. This leads to interesting predictions for neutrinoless double beta decay as well as for cosmology. For example, if the Majorana phase vanishes then there will be no contribution to neutrinoless double-beta decay but the sterile neutrino may still contribute significantly to dark matter production during inflation or reheating."}
{"text":"The assembly history of galaxies is one of the most important open questions in modern astrophysics, and it has been studied extensively using deep surveys at different wavelengths (e.g., optical\/near-infrared). In this work we present an analysis of the stellar mass assembly for a sample of more than 100 000 massive galaxies selected from the VVDS-02h field observed with the VIMOS spectrograph on board of the Very Large Telescope between 0 < z < 5. We use a novel technique based on the combination of photometric redshifts and spectral energy distribution fitting to derive accurate estimates of galaxy masses over such large redshift range. Our results show that the evolution of the average stellar mass density can be described by two main phases: i) a rapid increase up to z ~ 2 followed by ii) a slower growth phase until today. This behaviour is consistent with previous studies but our data allow us to study in detail how the build-up of stellar mass proceeds as a function of galaxy properties like colour or morphology."}
{"text":"PoGOLite is an experiment to measure the degree and angle of linear polarization for photons with energies between 100 MeV and 1 GeV, which are emitted by astrophysical sources such as pulsars or active galactic nuclei (AGN). The measurement principle relies on Compton scattering off electrons bound into atoms inside a scintillator crystal. In this work we present results obtained during commissioning runs at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) in Switzerland. We show that the detector response function can be described well within statistical uncertainties by Monte Carlo simulations based on Geant4. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the measured data can be used to extract information about the source's polarization properties. Finally, we discuss possible systematic effects related to the experimental setup.

{"text":"We present broadband (radio to X-ray) observations of GRB 061121, one of the most energetic gamma-ray bursts ever detected by Swift\/BAT with an isotropic equivalent energy release of 1.8 x 10^54 erg in the 15-350 keV band. The temporal behavior of this event was complex; it consisted of multiple pulses that were superimposed on top of each other during both the prompt emission phase as well as the early part of its afterglow. We find evidence for two distinct components in the optical light curve -one which decays rapidly at first but then flattens out later-on timescales ranging between 0.1-10 days post-burst. This flattening could be due either to continued activity of the central engine or to refreshed shocks. In addition we detect significant radio emission upto 100 days post-burst. Our results are consistent with those obtained using data from the VLA and ATCA telescopes."}
{"text":"The Burgers equation is the simplest nonlinear partial differential equation that can be used to model turbulence in fluids.  It has been studied extensively and many exact solutions are known, including shock waves (discontinuities) and solitons (travelling wave solutions). The Burgers equation arises as an approximation for fluid flow when viscosity effects are negligible compared with convection terms. In this case it describes the evolution of velocity fluctuations in a turbulent fluid. This article presents some basic results on the Burgers equation and its solutions. For more information see the references below or consult any standard textbook on mathematical physics. The Burgers equation is the most simple nonlinear partial differential equation which can be used to describe turbulence in fluids. It was first introduced by Robert H. Burgers in 1948[1][2][3][4][5] . It reads\n$$ \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2} \\right), $$\nwhere $u$ denotes the fluctuating component of the velocity field."}
{"text":"We present an analytical model for evaluating the effect of X-ray scattering on image quality in grazing incidence X-ray telescopes (GIXTs). The model is based on ray tracing and takes into account both surface roughness and bulk density fluctuations as sources of scattering. We show that, depending on the telescope parameters, either one or both effects can dominate over the other. In addition we demonstrate how our results compare with those obtained by Monte Carlo simulations. Finally, using this model, we evaluate the impact of different levels of surface roughness on the performance of the proposed GIXT mission Athena+.

{"text":"We present high resolution observations of the Cep-A HW2 infrared dark cloud (IRDC) made with the Submillimeter Array at 1.3 mm and 0.87 mm, as well as archival data obtained by Spitzer Space Telescope and Herschel Space Observatory. We find that this IRDC is associated with an open cluster containing several young stellar objects (YSOs). The YSOs are distributed along two parallel filaments oriented N-S which appear to be interacting with each other. In addition we detect a third filament extending E-W connecting these two main filaments. This structure suggests that the formation process may have been triggered by the collision between the two filaments. Based on our analysis of the spectral energy distribution for all detected sources, we conclude that most of them are Class I protostars or very low mass stars surrounded by envelopes. However, one source appears to be more evolved than others since it shows evidence of being a Class II object."}
{"text":"The intramolecular structure of polymers is studied by means of the molecular dynamics simulation method for several model systems with different chain lengths, degrees of branching, and types of interactions between monomers. It has been found that the intramolecular correlation function can be represented as a sum of two terms corresponding to short- and long-range contributions. The latter term describes the contribution of segments separated by distances larger than the average distance between neighboring chains. This term depends on the number density of chains and their length. In addition, it was shown that this term decreases exponentially at large separations. The dependence of the first four moments of the segmental size distribution on temperature and pressure are calculated using the results obtained previously. These dependences were compared with experimental data available in literature. Good agreement between theory and experiment is observed. \n \n Keywords: Polymer melt, Intramolecular structure, Correlation functions, Segmental size distribution"}
{"text":"We propose to use the concept of Maxwell's demon in order to explain how nanodevices can be used for information processing, storage or transmission. We show that this approach is useful because it allows us to understand why some devices are more efficient than others at performing these tasks. In particular we consider two types of nanodevices which have been proposed recently as candidates for quantum computers - spin chains and arrays of coupled cavities. The first type consists of an array of spins arranged on a line with nearest neighbour interactions between them while the second one has a similar structure but instead of spins it contains atoms trapped inside optical cavities. For both cases we calculate their efficiency using the Landauer principle. Finally we discuss possible experimental implementations of our ideas. Introduction:-The idea of Maxwell's demon was introduced by James Clerk Maxwell (1831-1879) [1] . It describes a hypothetical intelligent being who could control microscopic particles individually so that they would always move into separate containers depending on whether each particle had a higher energy level or lower energy level [2] .\nMaxwell's demon is usually described as a thought experiment whose purpose is to demonstrate that entropy cannot decrease spontaneously [3] , i.e., that heat does not flow spontaneously from hot bodies to cold ones [4] . However, there exists another interpretation of Maxwell's demon according to which he imagined a device capable of sorting individual molecules based on their velocities [5] . This interpretation leads naturally to the question about what sort of physical system might behave like such a device [6] ."}
{"text":"We present an algorithm that systematically scans all possible 7-colourings of the grid, and report on its performance in terms of running time and memory consumption. The algorithm is based on a simple backtracking scheme combined with some heuristics to prune parts of the search space.

For each instance we provide detailed information about how much time was spent by our program during colouring as well as how many colours were used. In addition, we also show how these results compare against those obtained by other algorithms proposed recently in the literature. \n \n Keywords: Coloring problems, Computational complexity theory, Graphs, Backtrack search, Heuristic methods, Grid graphs, Integer programming, Optimization problems, Search trees, Time-complexity analysis \n \n \n \n INTRODUCTION \n \n A graph G = (V, E) consists of two sets V and E where V denotes the set of vertices or nodes and E denotes the set of edges between pairs of nodes.

{"text":"We present an analytical solution to the problem of bending thin elastic shells with variable thickness under surface loads, which is applicable to the case where the shell's thickness varies by several orders of magnitude over its radius and where the load distribution is not necessarily axisymmetric.  We show that in this case it is possible to obtain accurate results using only two parameters instead of three as was previously thought necessary (the third parameter being the ratio between the maximum and minimum values of the shell's thickness). The new formulation allows us to calculate the deflection of the shell at any point on its surface without having to solve additional equations or perform numerical integration. This makes our approach much faster than previous methods while retaining high accuracy. Our method can be used to model the response of the Earth's crust to tectonic stresses and other processes such as volcanic loading and sedimentary deposition. It also has applications in geophysics beyond Earth sciences including planetary science, astrophysics and seismology. \nTheory\n\nIn order to study the deformation of the Earth's crust we need to know how the stress field changes across different regions of the planet. In particular, we are interested in understanding how the stress field evolves during plate boundary interactions like subduction zones and transform faults. To do so, we use the theory of elasticity to find solutions to problems involving the interaction between plates and their underlying mantle. However, solving these problems analytically requires simplifying assumptions about the geometry of the system and the mechanical properties of the materials involved. \n\nOne important simplification made when studying the mechanics of plate boundaries is to assume that they behave as if they were composed of thin elastic shells. These shells have been shown to provide good approximations to more realistic models of plate boundaries because they allow for rapid calculations of the stress fields within them. For example, Figure 1 shows a comparison between the predictions obtained using a simple spherical shell model and those produced by a finite element model of the San Andreas Fault System.\n\nFigure 1: Comparison between the predicted displacements along the San Andreas fault calculated using a spherical shell model (blue line) and a finite element model (red dots)."}
{"text":"We report on observations made with Chandra and XMM-Newton that reveal an X-ray flare from the magnetar CXOU J16 47 10 . 2-45 52 16 (hereafter, J1647) located within the open cluster Westerlund 1. The flare was detected by both observatories during their respective slews to point at another target; it lasted for about one hour before fading below detectability. We find no evidence for any significant change in the spin-down rate or period derivative of this source following its outburst. \n \n This is the first time such a large event has been observed from a magnetar; we estimate that the total energy released in the flare was ~3 x 10^44 erg. Our analysis shows that the flare occurred when the star's magnetic field lines were nearly perpendicular to our line-of-sight. In addition, we detect pulsations from J1647 during the flare which are consistent with those seen prior to the flare. These results suggest that the flaring activity may be due to reconnection events occurring along the closed loops of the stellar magnetic field."}
{"text":"We have analyzed the redshifts of two samples of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with different luminosities and found evidence for intrinsic redshift components in both cases.  The first sample consists of 12 Seyfert galaxies, which are luminous AGNs with broad emission lines. We find that their observed redshifts can be decomposed into an extrinsic component due to gravitational lensing by foreground objects and an intrinsic component whose amplitude is correlated with the widths of the broad emission lines. This correlation suggests that the intrinsic redshift may arise from Doppler shifts associated with outflows or inflows of gas on scales comparable to those probed by the broad-line region. The second sample contains low-luminosity quasars selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 4 quasar catalog. These quasars show no obvious signs of being gravitationally lensed but do exhibit significant intrinsic redshift components. In this case we find that the amplitudes of these components correlate strongly with the optical continuum slopes measured at rest-frame wavelengths near 3000 \u00c5 ."}
{"text":"We present new light curves for four dwarf plutonic planets (Pluto, Charon, Haumea, Makemake) and one large Kuiper belt object (Orcus). The data were obtained with the 1 m telescope at Mt. Lemmon Observatory in Arizona during two observing runs between September 2005 and January 2006. We used standard aperture photometry to extract the magnitudes of these objects as well as those of several comparison stars observed simultaneously. Our results show that Pluto's rotation period is ~6.4 days; its phase function has an amplitude of 0.3 mag over this range of heliocentric distances. For Orcus we find a rotation period of ~5.7 days and a phase function with an amplitude of about 0.2 mag. These values are consistent with previous determinations based on ground-based observations. In addition, our absolute magnitude measurements confirm earlier estimates for all five bodies studied here."}

This fact allows us to obtain accurate values of the mass ratio q = M2\/M1 between the components of this binary system. Using these new values we can estimate the absolute masses of both stars (0.7 \u00b1 0.05M\u2299) and their radii (3.5 \u00b1 0.2R\u2299).

{"text":"We present an analysis of the first year (1999) of data obtained by the Chandra X-ray Observatory's Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS). The survey was designed to detect and study bright, soft X-ray emitting comets in our solar system. We have detected four new cometary sources with ACIS-S3 that are not previously known as optical or radio emitters. These objects were found using a novel technique for identifying point-like sources based on their spatial extent along the detector readout direction. This method is particularly useful at low count rates where traditional source detection algorithms fail due to statistical fluctuations. All four newly discovered comets show significant variability over time scales ranging from hours to days. Two of these comets also exhibit periodicities consistent with rotation periods near one day. In addition we report on two other faint comets which may be related to the recently discovered Jupiter family of asteroids."}
{"text":"We study the evolution of an open universe with negative spatial curvature and a scalar field that is minimally coupled to gravity but has a positive kinetic energy density, known as a phantom field.  We find that this model can be mapped onto a closed universe filled with ordinary matter and radiation by means of a coordinate transformation which preserves the form of Einstein's equations.  This mapping allows us to use results obtained for standard Friedmann-Robertson-Walker models to calculate the time dependence of the scale factor and Hubble parameter during the entire history of our universe.   In particular we show how the present value of the dark energy density parameter $\\Omega_{\\Lambda}$ may be determined from measurements of the cosmic microwave background temperature anisotropy spectrum at large angular scales (low multipoles).   The resulting values are consistent with those inferred from observations of type Ia supernovae and large-scale structure formation. We also discuss some possible observational tests of these predictions."}
{"text":"We present the results of hydrodynamic simulations that show how supernova ejecta can interact with nearby protoplanetary disks and produce observable signatures in their infrared emission. We find that, depending on disk properties (mass, radius), the interaction may lead to an increase or decrease in the total luminosity emitted by the system at near-infrared wavelengths. The effect is strongest for massive disks around young stars; it decreases rapidly as the mass ratio between the star and its disk decreases. \n \n In addition, we find that the interaction leads to significant changes in the temperature distribution within the disk. These effects are most pronounced when the disk is relatively close to the supernova progenitor - less than 100 AU away. For more distant systems, the impact of the supernova blast wave becomes negligible. Finally, our models suggest that the observed excesses in mid-infrared flux detected towards some T Tauri stars could be due to such interactions."}

{"text":"We study temperature driven phase transitions between different charge ordered states in one-dimensional quarter-filled Hubbard model with nearest-neighbor hopping and on-site Coulomb repulsion using density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method. We find that at low temperatures, the system is in the Wigner crystal state where electrons are localized by strong electron correlations. With increasing temperature, we observe a first-order phase transition into bond-charge-density wave state which has been predicted theoretically earlier but not observed experimentally so far. The nature of this phase transition can be understood as melting of the Wigner crystal due to thermal fluctuations. Finally, we also investigate the effect of next-nearest neighbor hopping t\u2032 on these phases. Our results show that for small values of t\u2032 , the ground state remains in the Wigner crystal phase while for large values of t\u2032 it becomes metallic. This shows that the presence of next-nearest neighbor hoping may destroy the charge ordering in 1D systems."}
{"text":"We present new results on the faint-end slope and evolution of the luminosity function (LF) for optically-selected quasars in the redshift range 0.5 < z < 2.2, based on the VIMOS-VLT Deep Survey (VVDS).

Our best-fit values are obtained by combining these two techniques with Monte Carlo simulations. We find that our data is consistent with previous studies within their uncertainties. However we show that there exists an apparent discrepancy between the observed number density of bright quasars and the predictions made using the standard quasar formation model. This may be due to incompleteness effects or biases introduced during the selection process. In addition, we also investigate the dependence of the LF shape on the optical luminosities of quasars."}

{"text":"We report on the detection and characterization of two transit-like events observed with Spitzer Space Telescope (Werner et al., 2004) at 3.6 microns, which we interpret as being due to planets orbiting an M-dwarf star located near the center of the open cluster NGC 6791.  The first event was detected during our initial survey of this field using the IRAC camera on board Spitzer between 2005 May 24 and 2006 January 1.   We subsequently obtained follow-up observations over three epochs spanning more than one year that allowed us to confirm its planetary nature by detecting it again in all four bands simultaneously.  This is only the second time such a confirmation has been made after the original discovery observation.  The second event was discovered serendipitously while searching for additional transiting objects around the same target star following up on the first event.  Both events are characterized by their short duration (\u223c3 hours), shallow depth (0.1%-0.2%), and relatively high impact parameter (b=0.7-1).  These properties suggest they may be Neptune-sized or smaller planets.

We use near-infrared integral field spectroscopy obtained with SINFONI on the Very Large Telescope to study their kinematics and chemical composition. The stellar masses inferred for these objects suggest that they may be progenitors of supermassive black holes.

{"text":"Social tagging is an emerging technology that allows users to annotate resources with keywords or tags, which are then used by other users in their search and discovery processes. In this work we propose a novel approach to exploit social annotation information for automatic resource discovery. We first introduce the concept of semantic similarity between tags based on WordNet ontology. Then, using the proposed semantic similarity measure as well as user profile information, we develop two algorithms (i) TagRank and (ii) UserTagRank to rank the importance of each tag associated with a given resource. Finally, we conduct experiments over real-world datasets collected from Delicious website to evaluate our approaches. The experimental results show that both TagRank and UserTagRank can significantly improve the performance of existing state-of-the-art techniques.

Users usually assign tags to describe the contents they find interesting so that others may easily discover them later [2] .\nIn recent years there has been growing interest in developing new technologies to take advantage of social tagging systems [3] , including recommender systems [4] , personalized search [5] , question answering [6] , text classification [7] , event detection [8] , and so forth.

{"text":"We present an approach to personalize image search results in the context of social networks, by exploiting user-generated tags and ratings. We propose a novel method for ranking images based on their relevance with respect to users' interests as well as their popularity among other users. Our experiments show that our proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art approaches both quantitatively (in terms of precision) and qualitatively (by showing more relevant images). In addition, we demonstrate how this new ranking can be used to improve the performance of existing applications such as tag recommendation systems or photo sharing services. Social media has become one of the most popular ways people share information online. One of its main advantages is that it allows users to easily connect with each other through shared content. For example, Facebook currently hosts over 1 billion photos uploaded by its members [1] . Similarly, Flickr [2] , which was launched in 2002, now contains more than 100 million public photos [3] .\nIn these platforms, users are able to upload pictures they have taken themselves or find interesting ones from others. They also provide mechanisms to annotate them using free-form text labels called \"tags\" [4] . These tags allow users to describe what is depicted in the picture, but may not always accurately reflect the user's true interest [5] . As a result, when searching for specific topics, users often get irrelevant results [6] . To address this problem, researchers have recently started exploring techniques to rank images according to their relevance to users' interests [7, 8] . However, there still exists significant room for improvement [9] ."}
{"text":"We present an algorithm for computing two-person zero-sum games with imperfect information, which is based on solving linear programs (LPs) and mixed integer programming problems (MIPs). The proposed approach can be applied to any game that has been formulated as a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP), including many real-world applications such as energy markets or traffic control systems. We show how our method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of computational efficiency by applying it to several test cases. In addition, we provide insights into the structure of the problem instances solved by our algorithm. Finally, we discuss possible extensions of this work. Games are mathematical models used to describe situations where multiple decision makers interact strategically. A key concept in game theory is equilibrium, i.e., a set of strategies that no player wants to deviate from if all other players stick to their strategy. One important class of equilibria are so-called Nash equilibria, which have received considerable attention over the past decades due to their wide applicability across various fields ranging from economics to computer science. However, finding Nash equilibria is known to be computationally hard even for simple classes of games."}

{"text":"We present the demographics and properties of transition objects in SDSS DR7, which are defined as galaxies with both emission lines (ELGs) and absorption features (AGNs). We find that there is an excess number of ELG-AGN pairs at small separations compared to random distributions. The fraction of AGNs among all ELGs increases towards lower luminosities. There appears to be no significant difference between the fractions of AGNs found within different types of ELGs. These results suggest that some ELGs may harbor hidden AGNs. This work was supported by NASA grant NNX10AD65G. We thank the anonymous referee for helpful comments on this manuscript. In recent years, it has been shown that many active galactic nuclei (AGNs), especially those with low luminosity or obscured by dusty torii, have strong emission line components (see e.g., Ho et al. (1997) , Hao et al. (2005) ), making them appear like normal star-forming galaxies when observed through optical spectroscopic surveys such as Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS; York et al. (2000) ) .\nIn order to identify these \"transition objects\", we use two criteria based on their spectral energy distribution (SED): 1) they must show both emission lines (ELGs; see Section 2.1 below) and absorption features (Section 2.2) simultaneously; and 2) they should not be classified as quasars according to the BPT diagram (Baldwin et al. 1981 , Kewley et al. 2001 . By applying these selection criteria to the entire sample of galaxies in the seventh data release (DR7; Abazajian et al. 2009 ) of the SDSS, we obtain a total of 16,082 transition objects out of a parent sample of 3,962,843 galaxies."}
{"text":"In this note, we give two results about homogeneous nilpotent polynomials with respect to the Hessian operator. \nThe first result is that any such polynomial can be written as a sum of squares in infinitely many ways if and only if it has no real root. The second one is that for any integer n > 1 there exists an irreducible homogeneous nilpotent polynomial of degree 2n which cannot be written as a sum-of-squares. We also show how these results are related to some classical problems in algebraic geometry. Keywords: Sums of Squares, Homogeneous Nilpotent Polynomials, Algebraic Geometry.

Any opinions expressed here are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Science Foundation. In this note, we study homogeneous nilpotent polynomials under the Hessian operator. Recall that a polynomial $f\\in\\mathbb R[x_1,...,x_n]$ is called homogeneous if all its monomials have the same total degree. For example, $x^2+y^2$ is a homogeneous quadratic polynomial while $xy$ isn't because the degrees of $x$ and $y$ differ. Let $Hf(x)=\\nabla^2 f(x)$ denote the Hessian matrix of $f$ at point $x$. A polynomial $f\\in\\mathbb R[x]$ is said to be nilpotent wrt $H$ if $H^kf=0$ for some positive integer $k$. It turns out that every homogeneous nilpotent polynomial must be divisible by the square-free part of its leading coefficient. Therefore, without loss of generality, we may assume that the leading coefficient of $f$ is equal to $1$. \n \n As usual, let $\\Delta_k$ denotes the set of all unordered partitions of the number $k$ into distinct parts. Given a partition $\\lambda\\in\\Delta_n$, we define $$|\\lambda|=\\sum_{l=1}^n l^{\\lambda_l}.$$ \n \n Then our main theorem reads as follows: \nTHEOREM 0.1. Let $n$ be a positive integer"}
{"text":"In this note, we prove the following theorem. \nTheorem 1 Let $(M,g)$ be an $n$-dimensional compact Riemannian manifold without boundary and let $\\Delta_g$ denote its Laplace-Beltrami operator.

The proof relies heavily on the heat kernel estimates obtained by Li-Yau [L-Y] and Davies [Dav1] . We then use these results to give a new proof of the vanishing conjecture due to H\u00f6rmander [H\u00f6r] , which states that if $L$ is a differential operator with constant coefficients acting between sections of vector bundles over a closed Riemannian manifold $(M,g_M)$ whose principal symbol $\\sigma_p(L)$ satisfies $|\\sigma_p(L)|<1$ everywhere, then $L=0$."}
{"text":"We present new constructions for locally decodable codes (LDCs) based on nice subsets of finite fields, prime factors of Mersenne numbers, and the Chinese remainder theorem. Our first construction is an explicit family of LDCs with optimal query complexity that are derived from nice subsets of finite fields. We then show how to use these results in conjunction with the Chinese remainder theorem to obtain families of LDCs whose parameters can be tuned by varying the number of primes used in their construction. Finally we give a lower bound on the length of any LDC over a binary alphabet which uses only one-sided queries. The proofs of our main theorems appear at the end of this extended abstract. \nIntroduction\n\nLocally decodable codes (abbreviated as LCDs)\nare error correcting codes where each codeword has associated with it some decoding algorithm that allows efficient recovery of individual bits or symbols when queried about them. In particular, if the codeword is corrupted by up to t errors, then there exists a deterministic polynomial time algorithm that recovers the original uncorrupted word using O(t) queries per symbol. This property makes such codes useful in applications like data storage systems, peer-to-peer networks, and streaming media distribution services. \n \n A large body of work has been devoted towards understanding the trade-off between the rate of the code, its distance, and the query complexity of the decoder. For example, Guruswami et al. (2005), Chan et al. (2006) , and Kopparty & Saraf (2007)  studied the problem of constructing codes with low query complexity while maintaining high rates and distances. Recently, several works have focused on improving the known bounds on the minimum possible query complexity required to decode a single bit given a certain amount of corruption. These include the recent breakthrough result of Dvir et al. (2010a) (which improved upon the previous best-known upper bound due to Sudan et al., 2005 ) and the subsequent improvements made by Dvir et al. (2011 ), Feldman et al. (2012 , and Kopparty et al.

{"text":"The spectrum of cosmic rays is determined by the energy distribution of particles accelerated at shocks formed during supernova explosions and their subsequent propagation through space.  The observed fluxes are consistent with theoretical predictions for shock acceleration if one assumes that most cosmic rays have been accelerated to energies above 10^15 eV (the \"knee\") but below 10^17 eV (the \"ankle\"). Above this energy there appears to be an additional component which may be due to some other mechanism such as magnetic reconnection or turbulence driven acceleration. This article reviews recent progress on understanding the origin of cosmic rays up to the highest energies detected so far. Cosmic ray observations show that they consist mainly of protons and helium nuclei with charge numbers Z=1-2. These ions can reach energies up to 10^{20}eV, corresponding to Lorentz factors of about 10^{10}. Their total power input into interstellar space amounts to about 10% of the solar luminosity."}
{"text":"We present optical spectroscopic observations for the sample of 14 extreme high energy peaked BL Lac objects (EHBLs) selected by Costamante et al. (2013) . The main goal is to study their host galaxy properties and investigate possible differences with respect to lower-energy blazars, which are known to be hosted in elliptical galaxies. We find that all EHBLs have redshifts between 0.1 and 1.0, consistent with previous results on this class of sources. All but one source show evidence of being hosted in spiral or irregular galaxies; only PKS 0537-441 shows an elliptical-like spectrum.

The latter type can be excited only by external perturbations. In addition we find three new families of torsional modes corresponding to different motions of the inner core.

{"text":"We study the propagation of surface waves in a layered medium with different signs of nonlinear coefficients and show that, under certain conditions, localized solutions exist which are similar to those known as gap solitons in periodic structures. The existence domain for these solutions is determined by solving an eigenvalue problem numerically. We also present results on the stability properties of such solutions against small perturbations. Surface wave localization can be observed experimentally using optical waveguide arrays or photonic crystals. In this work we consider the case when two layers have opposite signs of nonlinearities (e.g., one positive and another negative). This situation occurs naturally if the material parameters change sign across some interface between media. For example, it may happen near the boundary between materials with normal dispersion and anomalous dispersion. \n \n We demonstrate that there exists a class of localized solutions which resemble gap solitons in periodic systems. These solutions appear due to the interplay between linear and nonlinear effects. They exist only within a finite range of frequencies and decay exponentially away from their center point. Their amplitude depends strongly on the ratio of the amplitudes of the incident and reflected waves."}

The results presented here provide important information on the structure of the low-energy effective field theory describing hadron physics. Introduction - Baryons containing three quarks have been studied extensively over many years both experimentally and theoretically [1] . However, despite this effort there remain several open questions about their properties which cannot yet be answered conclusively. One example concerns the nature of the lightest exotic state predicted by quark models [2] , namely the so-called ``antidecuplet'' consisting of 10 states with spin 1\/2, 3\/2, ..., 9\/2. These states include the recently discovered P$^+$(1440) [3] and D$^+$(2350) [4] resonances observed in pion-nucleon scattering experiments performed at Jefferson Lab [5] .\nThe masses of all ten members of the antidecuplet lie below 2 GeV [6] so that they should be accessible to experimental studies using current facilities [7, 8] . It has therefore become increasingly important to develop theoretical tools capable of predicting reliably the physical characteristics of these particles. This task requires an understanding of how the various interactions present in QCD affect the internal dynamics of the system [9] . Chiral Perturbation Theory (ChPT), which describes the low energy behaviour of QCD [10] , provides a suitable framework for addressing this problem [11] ."}

The main idea is that students can learn about the foundations of special relativity without having to deal with complicated mathematical concepts such as tensors or spinor fields. This article describes how this method works on examples related to the Lorentz transformations. It also discusses some possible applications of these ideas in other areas of physics.

{"text":"The nucleon is described as an extended object with internal structure, which can be probed by elastic scattering experiments at high energies and small momentum transfers. The present work focuses on the investigation of chiral mechanisms leading to orbital quantum structures within the framework of effective field theory (EFT). In particular we study the role played by pionic degrees of freedom for the description of the nucleon's electromagnetic form factors. We show that the inclusion of explicit pions leads to significant improvements over previous calculations based solely on quark degrees of freedom. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the EFT approach allows one to systematically include higher-order corrections into the calculation of observables. Finally, we discuss possible extensions of our formalism towards the treatment of other hadronic systems such as nuclei or hypernuclei. The nucleon is described as a composite system consisting of quarks bound together via gluons. However, it has been known since the early days of QCD [1] , that this picture cannot fully explain all experimental observations [2] . For example, while the proton's electric charge radius agrees well with experiment [3] , its magnetic moment turns out to be about 30% larger than expected [4] .\nIn order to resolve these discrepancies between theoretical predictions and experimental data, it was suggested [5] that additional contributions arising from the presence of virtual mesonic fluctuations should be taken into account [6] .

{"text":"The electronic structure and transport properties of intrinsic ripples on single-layered graphene are investigated by using the tight-binding model with first-principles hopping parameters, which is based on density-functional theory (DFT). The results show that the ripple-induced local strain can lead to an energy gap opening at Dirac point for both armchair and zigzag directions. In addition, it is found that the electron mobility decreases as the amplitude increases due to the increase of scattering centers induced by the ripple structures. These findings may be useful for understanding the physical mechanism behind the experimental observations of rippling effects on the electrical performance of graphene devices. Graphene has attracted great attention because its unique two-dimensional honeycomb lattice structure leads to many novel phenomena such as high carrier mobility [1] , Klein tunneling [2] , valley polarization [3] , etc.. However, recent experiments have shown that the pristine flat monolayer graphene sheets tend to form ripples spontaneously [4] . It was also reported that these ripples could affect the electrical performance of graphene-based devices [5] .\nIn this work we investigate the effect of ripples on the electronic structure and transport properties within the framework of the tight-binding model [6] . We find that the ripple-induced strains can open up an energy gap around the Fermi level for both armchair andzigzag directions.

{"text":"We present an extension to the classical lubrication theory that accounts for shear thinning effects on both the fluid viscosity and the friction coefficient, which are assumed to be functions of local pressure only.  The resulting model is applied to study the effect of non-Newtonian rheology on the elastohydrodynamic (EHD) behavior of a circular contact between two elastic solids with different surface roughnesses under pure rolling conditions.  We show that the presence of shear thinning leads to significant changes in the predicted load-carrying capacity as well as the distribution of the normal stress across the contact area compared to those obtained using Newtonian models.  In particular, we find that the maximum value of the dimensionless pressure increases significantly when the fluids exhibit strong shear thinning characteristics.  Moreover, our results indicate that the inclusion of shear thinning effects can lead to substantial reductions in the magnitude of the dimensionless tangential stresses at the centerline of the contact region.  Finally, it should be noted that the proposed theoretical framework may also be used to investigate other important phenomena such as thermal effects or mixed lubrication regimes."}
{"text":"The effect of the lubricant viscosity on friction in elastohydrodynamic (EHD) regime is investigated by using numerical simulations based on Reynolds equation coupled with elasticity equations for an axisymmetric slider bearing system. The results show that, at low sliding speeds, the traction decreases as the lubricant viscosity increases due to the increase of pressure gradient along the film thickness direction. At high sliding speeds, however, the opposite trend occurs because the viscous shear stress becomes dominant over the pressure gradient term. In mixed lubrication regimes where both hydrodynamic and boundary layers exist simultaneously, it was found that the minimum traction can be reduced significantly when the lubricant viscosity is increased. This reduction is attributed mainly to the decrease of the maximum pressure in the contact region. \n \n Keywords: Elastohydrodynamics; Slider Bearing; Minimum Film Thickness; Viscosity; Pressure Gradient Term"}
{"text":"We present the phenomenological consequences for neutrino physics and cosmology in models where massive neutrinos are Majorana particles, i.e., their own antiparticles.  We show that such models can be constrained by current experiments on neutrinoless double beta decay (0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2) as well as future ones. In addition we discuss how these constraints affect other phenomena like leptogenesis or dark matter searches. Finally, we comment on possible connections between 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 and lepton flavor violating processes. The Standard Model is an extremely successful description of particle interactions at low energies but it fails to explain several important issues including the origin of mass. One possibility to address this problem is to extend the SM by adding new fields which couple only very weakly to ordinary matter. Such extensions typically predict new light states beyond those already known experimentally. A particularly interesting class of theories contains right-handed neutrinos whose masses may be generated via seesaw mechanisms [1] . These heavy neutrinos could have observable effects in many different areas ranging from neutrino oscillations [2] , rare decays [3] , collider signatures [4] , gravitational waves [5] , to cosmology [6] .\nIn this work we consider scenarios where the three active neutrinos \u03bd e , \u03bd \u00b5 , \u03bd \u03c4 mix with one or more sterile neutrinos N 1 , . . . N n [7, 8] . This mixing leads to additional contributions to the effective mass m ee = |<(V * ei V ej )m ij >| 2 relevant for neutrinoless double-beta decay [9] . Current experimental bounds [10] imply that m ee < O(10 \u22122 \u2212 10 \u22121 eV). Future experiments will improve these limits significantly [11] . If the observed value turns out to be close to its upper bound then the corresponding scenario would provide evidence for Majorana neutrinos [12] . On the other hand if no signal is found then the model predicts that all neutrinos are Dirac fermions [13] ."}

In particular we find good agreement between theory and experiment on the energy per particle of 4 He-4 He mixtures near the superfluid transition temperature T = Tc. Our results are also compared with those obtained using other theoretical approaches such as the virial expansion or the hypernetted chain approximation. \nI. INTRODUCTORY REMARK\nThe equation of state plays an important role in many areas of physics ranging from nuclear matter [1] , quantum gases [2] , astrophysics [3] , condensed matter [4] , etc.. It describes how various thermodynamic quantities depend on each other under given conditions. For example, it can be used to determine the pressure P , chemical potential \u00b5, entropy S, specific heat Cv, compressibility \u03baT , thermal expansivity \u03b1p, sound velocity cs, etc., all of them being functions of density n and\/or temperature T . Hereafter we will use the symbol EOS to denote any of these quantities.\nIn this work we consider the case when the scattering length a of two particles becomes very large so that the system behaves like a gas of weakly interacting dimers. This situation occurs e.g. in dilute Bose-Einstein condensates [5] where the scattering length may be tuned via Feshbach resonances [6] .\nII. THEORETICAL APPROACHES\n\nA. Grand Canonical Ensemble\nTo describe the properties of a mixture consisting of N\u03b1 atoms of species A and N\u03b2 atoms of species B, we employ the grand-canonical ensemble [7, 8] \nwhere H is the total Hamiltonian of the system, \u03b2 \u2261 1\/kB T denotes inverse temperature, \u03bci is the chemical potential of species i \u2208 {A, B}, and Z(N\u03b1,"}
{"text":"Gravitational wave astronomy is an emerging field that will provide new insights into the universe and its fundamental laws through observations of gravitational waves emitted by merging black holes, neutron stars or other compact objects in distant galaxies.  In this work we present several tests of different techniques used to select between competing models describing the observed data. We consider two examples where the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the detected signals are low enough so that it becomes difficult to distinguish between different physical scenarios using standard frequentist hypothesis testing methods. The first example considers the problem of distinguishing between binary black hole systems with spin aligned versus anti-aligned with their orbital angular momentum vector. The second example considers the problem of determining whether a given source has been emitting gravitational radiation continuously over time as opposed to being active only during short bursts. For both cases we compare results obtained using three different model selection methods: Akaike's information criterion (AIC), Bayes factors computed via nested sampling (NS-BF), and the Deviance Information Criterion (DIC)."}
{"text":"We present an analytical model to study the effect of mass loading feedback on particle concentration and enstrophy in fully developed turbulence. The cascade process is modeled by using a set of coupled ordinary differential equations, which are derived based on dimensional analysis and Kolmogorov's similarity hypothesis. We show that the presence of particles can significantly affect both the energy transfer rate between different scales as well as the dissipation rates at small scales. In particular, we find that the total amount of energy transferred into smaller scales decreases when there exists significant mass loading feedback. This result suggests that the presence of heavy particles may lead to reduced turbulent mixing efficiency. Finally, our results also indicate that the effects of mass loading feedback become more pronounced if the Stokes number increases or the initial volume fraction of particles becomes larger. Our findings provide useful insights into understanding how heavy particles influence the dynamics of fluid flows.

{"text":"We present an evolutionary model that unifies the dynamics of evolution with those of network formation, in which individuals are connected to each other by social ties. The model is based on two key ideas: (1) selection occurs at both individual and group levels simultaneously; and (2) groups compete for resources through their members' interactions. We show how this simple framework can explain many observed phenomena such as cooperation among unrelated individuals, cultural transmission between generations, and the emergence of hierarchies within societies. Our results suggest that these processes may be driven by competition over limited resources rather than genetic relatedness or imitation alone. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled \"Evolutionary Computation -From Theory to Applications\" guest edited by Prof. Dr. Andreas Stadler. In recent years there has been growing interest in understanding the interplay between evolution and networks [1-3]. On one hand, it is well known that natural selection acts upon individuals competing for scarce resources [4] . On the other hand, it is also clear that social relationships play a crucial role in shaping human behavior [5] , including cooperative behaviors [6] .\nIn this work we propose a novel evolutionary model that unifies these two perspectives into a single formalism. More specifically, our approach considers populations composed of agents who interact locally with others [7-9]. These local interactions give rise to global patterns of connectivity [10] , which in turn affect the fitness of individuals [11] . As a result, selection operates not only at the level of individuals but also at the level of groups [12] . Moreover, groups compete for resources through the actions of their members [13] ."}

{"text":"We propose to measure the entropy of de Sitter space by counting the number of states in which it can be embedded into Minkowski spacetime, as well as its embedding into anti-de Sitter (AdS) space.  We find that this quantity is proportional to the volume of the universe at late times, but grows exponentially with time during eternal inflation. This suggests that our proposed measure may provide an explanation for why we do not observe any remnants of the early universe: if there are too many possible histories, then most will have very different properties than ours. The holographic principle has been used extensively over recent years to study quantum gravity on asymptotically Anti-de Sitter spaces. In particular, the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of black holes was shown to agree exactly with the entropy associated with the degrees of freedom localized near the event horizon. However, these results were obtained only after assuming that the boundary conditions satisfied by fields propagating through AdS space corresponded precisely to those required to preserve unitarity. It would therefore seem natural to ask whether similar techniques could also be applied to more general spacetimes such as de Sitter space. Unfortunately, while the answer to this question appears positive when considering static observers, it becomes less clear how to proceed once one considers dynamical situations where particles are created or destroyed."}

Our results suggest that these objects were typically smaller than their local counterparts when they formed most of their stars. This may be related to the fact that massive galaxies grow through mergers over cosmic time. \n \n Keywords: Galaxy evolution, Quasars, Absorbers, Massive black holes \n \n \n \n High-redshift quasars provide powerful probes for studying the physical properties of distant galaxies.

Our approach uses a novel combination of techniques including fast matrix multiplication algorithms, data structures based on interval trees, and efficient graph traversal methods.

{"text":"We present new constructions of low density parity check (LDPC) codes with good performance on both the binary symmetric channel (BSC), as well as the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel, which can be used in conjunction with either Slepian-Wolf or Wyner-Ziv compression to achieve capacity-achieving distributed lossy data storage systems over noisy channels.  We show how these LDPC codes can also be used to perform lossless distributed data storage by using them within an erasure correcting code framework known as rateless fountain codes.   Finally we demonstrate how our proposed scheme is able to outperform existing schemes at high rates when operating under practical constraints such as finite field size and limited number of decoding iterations. The problem of storing large amounts of information reliably across multiple nodes has been studied extensively in recent years due to its applications in cloud computing, peer-to-peer networks, wireless sensor networks, and other areas where there exists a need to store data securely while minimizing network bandwidth requirements. In this work, we consider the scenario where two parties wish to communicate via a noisy communication link, but do not trust each other's ability to faithfully transmit their messages. This situation arises naturally if one party wishes to send private data to another party who does not have access to a direct connection between themselves; see Figure 1 . For example, Alice may want to send her medical records to Bob through a third-party server Charlie, without revealing any sensitive information about herself to Charlie."}
{"text":"We study the effects on electroweak precision observables (EWPO) due to new physics at the TeV scale, which is motivated by recent LHC results and theoretical arguments for naturalness. We consider two classes of models with extra dimensions: Randall-Sundrum (RS) warped space model and holographic technicolor (HTC). In RS model we find that the corrections are too large compared to EWPOs if the mass scales involved satisfy MPlanck ~ 5TeV. However, this problem can be solved by introducing an additional bulk scalar field whose VEV breaks custodial symmetry softly. The resulting correction to T parameter is found to be small enough even when MPlanck = 5TeV.

The observations were performed simultaneously in H-band (1.6 microns), K-band (2.0 microns), and L-band (3.8 microns).\nThe results show that both stars have extended atmospheres which vary significantly during the pulsations cycle. In particular we find that:  - For Y Oph, our best-fit model is consistent with an atmosphere extending up to about 1 AU above its photosphere.  - For alpha Per, our best-fit models suggest that the star has an extended atmosphere reaching out to more than 2 AU above its photosphere."}

In particular we study the impact on the decay branching ratios of neutralinos into leptons and quarks due to the presence of new sources of flavour violation beyond minimal supergravity. The latter are induced by the non-diagonal entries of the sfermion mass matrices which can be sizeable even if they are generated only radiatively.

This article presents two different approaches that can be used by infrastructure-based WLANs (IB-WLAN) to achieve fairness provisioning between stations using the basic service set (BSS). The first approach is based on the concept of virtual queues and uses a modified version of the backoff algorithm proposed by Bianchi [1] . The second one relies on the use of a token bucket filter at each station to limit its transmission rate. Both solutions are evaluated through simulation experiments under various traffic conditions. It has been shown that both schemes perform well when there exists only one active flow per BSS; however, they suffer from poor performance as more flows compete simultaneously for channel access.

{"text":"We study the limit degree distributions of growing networks with prescribed initial degrees and arbitrary growth rules, where each new node is connected to exactly one existing node chosen uniformly at random among all nodes that are already present in the network.

In particular we prove that any sequence of such graphs converges weakly as n goes to infinity towards an exponential family of probability measures on [0, 1] parametrized by their mean value. This result allows us to derive explicit expressions for the limiting degree distributions of several classes of growing networks including preferential attachment models, copying models or threshold models.

{"text":"The shock temperatures for molybdenum were determined by measuring the electrical resistance of samples shocked to pressures up to 1,000 kilobars (1 Mbar). The release temperature was measured using an optical pyrometer on samples that had been heated with laser light after being shocked at various levels of pressure. \n \n Shocks produced by a pulsed power machine were used to compress the sample material between two electrodes. A voltage pulse applied across these electrodes caused current flow through the compressed material which generated Joule heating. This heat increased the resistivity of the material causing it to expand rapidly as its temperature rose above the Curie point. As this expansion occurred, the resistance dropped dramatically resulting in a sharp increase in current flowing into the sample. When the current reached a critical value, the sample exploded releasing most of its stored energy. The explosion also destroyed one or both of the electrodes so that no further measurement could be made until new ones were installed."}

In this regime, the mean lifetime decreases exponentially with increasing temperature T . For intermediate values of V0 ( Vc < V0 < Vs ), we observe a double-exponential decay of the survival probability indicating a second-order phase transition. The mean lifetime increases linearly with decreasing temperature below Tc , where Tc is the critical temperature at which the system undergoes a continuous phase transition into the metastable state.

This effect is strongest for low-mass galaxies with high specific star formation rates. In addition, we find that mergers tend to increase the average BH-to-galaxy mass ratio as well as the fraction of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) among massive galaxies. These findings are consistent with observations of AGN host galaxies.

The key idea behind our approach is to replace the kinetic potentials appearing in the usual OF-DFT expressions by their ab initio counterparts obtained directly from the local pseudopotentials used in standard quantum chemistry calculations. We show how this can be done systematically using only information about the occupied states provided by such calculations. As a result we are able to calculate the total energies as well as various other quantities within OF-DFT with essentially no additional computational cost compared to conventional molecular dynamics simulations based on classical force fields. This opens up new possibilities for studying complex systems where both electronic structure effects and thermal fluctuations play important roles simultaneously. \n \n Orbital-free density functional theory (DFT), which was originally developed more than 50 years ago [1] , has become one of the most widely used methods in theoretical physics [2] .

This behavior can be understood by considering the effect of rare regions whose energy gap scales as $1\/N$, leading to exponential decay of correlations at late times. In contrast, we find that if the initial state is chosen to have maximal overlap with the ground state of the final Hamiltonian then there are no relaxation effects whatsoever.

The main focus so far has been on closed quantum many-body systems described by Hamiltonians with short-range interactions [3] , but recently attention has shifted to open quantum systems [4] .\nIn particular, it was shown [5] that even when the initial state is highly excited, the evolution after a global quench will eventually relax into thermal equilibrium [6] . However, recent studies [7, 8] suggest that relaxation does not occur generically in open quantum systems, i.e., when the initial state is prepared by coupling the system to another reservoir or bath [9] . Instead, one expects equilibration only under certain conditions [10] : For example, if the initial state is close enough to the ground state of the new Hamiltonian [11] , or if the spectrum of the post-quench Hamiltonian contains a sufficiently large number of low-lying excitations [12] ."}
{"text":"We study the evolution of networks with preferential attachment, where nodes can choose their neighbors according to some fitness measure. We show that this simple mechanism leads to scale-free degree distributions and clustering coefficients comparable to those observed for real-world networks. In addition we find that the model exhibits an interesting phase transition between two regimes characterized by different levels of assortativity. The results are obtained using numerical simulations as well as analytical calculations based on mean-field theory. Introduction: Many complex systems such as social or biological networks evolve over time through the process of adding new elements (nodes) which connect to existing ones [1] . This is known as \"network growth\" [2] , and it has been shown that many properties of these growing networks depend crucially on how connections among old nodes are established [3] .\nIn particular, Barab\u00e1si and Albert [4] proposed a very successful model of network growth called \"preferential attachment\": at each step one node is added together with m links connecting it to already present nodes; the probability \u03a0(k) that a newly introduced node connects to an old node i depends only on its current number k of connections, so that more connected nodes have higher chances of receiving further links. It was later realized [5] that this simple rule gives rise to scale-free degree distribution [6] : the fraction P (k) of nodes having exactly k connections decays asymptotically like a power law P (k) \u221d k \u2212\u03b3 [7, 8] . Moreover, recent studies [9] suggest that the presence of correlations between degrees of neighboring nodes may be responsible for high values of clustering coefficient [10] observed in many real world networks [11] .\nThe original BA model assumes that all nodes are equivalent when choosing their neighbors. However, there exist several examples of real-world networks [12] where nodes attach themselves to other nodes depending also on additional features [13] .

{"text":"Mutations are the primary source of genetic variation, but they can also be deleterious and cause disease. Mutation rates vary widely across species; for example, humans have higher mutation rates than bacteria or viruses. In this study we investigate how population size affects evolution's ability to select against mutations that decrease fitness.  We find that when there is only one copy of each gene (the haploid case), selection cannot eliminate all deleterious mutations even if their effects on fitness are very strong. However, as the number of copies per gene increases beyond two (the diploid case) it becomes possible to remove most deleterious mutations by natural selection. This effect occurs because having multiple copies of genes allows individuals with different alleles at a given locus to reproduce successfully. Our results suggest that larger populations evolve more robust proteins due to stronger purifying selection acting on them. The relationship between population size and mutational robustness may help explain why some organisms such as humans evolved high mutation rates while others like bacteria evolved low ones."}

These results are applied to calculate the optical properties of periodic structures such as Bragg reflectors and photonic crystals. In particular we discuss how the band structure can be obtained from the knowledge of the reflection coefficient only. Finally, we show that our formalism allows one to study also non-periodic systems like superlattices and quantum wells. \nI. INTRODUCTORY REMARK\nThe aim of this work is to develop a general theory which describes the propagation of waves through multilayer structures consisting of alternating layers of different materials. This includes both periodic (photonic) and aperiodic (superlattice-like) arrangements of layers. Our main interest lies in the calculation of the reflection and transmission coefficients as well as the phase shifts occurring upon passage through each individual layer. As will become clear below these quantities provide all information necessary to determine the electronic and optical properties of the system under consideration. \n \n A number of authors have studied the wave optics of multilayered media using various approaches [1] . Most of them were concerned with the case where the interfaces separating neighboring layers are flat [2] - [4] , i.e., they do not contain any steps in their profiles. However, it has been shown recently [5] that even small deviations from perfect periodicity may lead to dramatic changes in the physical behavior of the system. For example, if the interface profile contains a single step then the corresponding energy spectrum becomes discrete [6] . Moreover, the presence of steps leads to new types of excitations known as surface plasmons [7] . It should be noted here that the effects caused by the presence of steps cannot always be neglected since they often play an important role in determining the overall performance of devices made out of semiconductor heterostructures [8] . \n \n Another interesting feature associated with stepped interfaces is"}

Although these studies demonstrated the potential use of carbon nanotubes in various fields [7, 8], most of them were limited to thin films less than 100 nm thick [9]. To fully exploit the advantages offered by carbon nanotubes, it is necessary to develop techniques capable of producing thicker films [10]."}
{"text":"The electronic properties of solids are determined by their ground and excited state energies, which can be calculated using ab initio wave function-based approaches such as density functional theory (DFT). However, these calculations often suffer from an incomplete description of electron-electron interactions due to the use of approximate exchange-correlation potentials. In this work we present a method that allows us to correct DFT results for excited states with respect to exact many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) results. We apply our approach to calculate the optical absorption spectrum of MgO and compare it to experimental data. Our results show good agreement between experiment and theory over a wide range of photon energies. The presented methodology is applicable to any material where MBPT results exist or can be obtained within reasonable computational effort. This includes most semiconductors but also insulators like ionic compounds. \n \n Ab initio wave-function based methods have become standard tools for calculating the electronic properties of materials. These include ground-state total energy calculations [1], phonon dispersion relations [2], elastic constants [3], magnetic moments [4], and transport coefficients [5]. They are routinely used to predict structural phase transitions [6], defect formation energies [7-9], surface energies [10-12], and chemical reactions [13-15]. Furthermore they provide insight into fundamental physical phenomena including superconductivity [16], magnetism [17], charge-density waves [18], ferroelectricity [19], and quantum critical points [20]. Finally, they allow one to study the effects of external perturbations on the electronic structure [21], e.g., strain [22], pressure [23], electric fields [24], temperature [25], or doping [26]."}

{"text":"We present an analysis of ellipsoidal oscillations induced in main-sequence stars by their substellar companions, and discuss prospects for detecting such signals with the Kepler mission. We find that these effects are detectable over a wide range of orbital periods (from 1 to 1000 days) and companion masses (0.1-10 MJ). The amplitude of the signal is proportional to the square root of the mass ratio between the star and its companion; it can be as large as 0.1% of the total flux at optical wavelengths. For typical parameters expected among planet-hosting systems, we estimate that this effect should produce a peak-to-peak variation in brightness on the order of 10 mmag or less. This level of precision will require several months of continuous observations using the Kepler spacecraft's photometer. However, if detected, the presence of such a signal would provide strong evidence for the existence of a low-mass stellar or planetary companion orbiting the primary star. \n \n Keywords: Ellipsoidal variations, Planetary system"}
{"text":"We study the dynamics and mechanics of single microtubules in vitro, using optical tweezers to apply forces along their length. We find that microtubules are remarkably stiff against bending but soft against stretching. The elastic response is well described by an entropic spring model with persistence length p = 1.5 mm. Microtubules can be bent into shapes such as rings or helices without breaking. When we bend them back towards straightness they relax at rates which depend on the applied tension. This suggests that microtubules have internal stresses built up during bending. These results provide new insights into how microtubules may behave inside cells where they experience both external loads and internal tensions due to motor proteins pulling on them. Microtubules (MTs) play important roles in many cellular processes including cell division [1] , intracellular transport [2] and mechanosensing [3] . They consist of tubulin dimers arranged head-to-tail into protofilaments [4] . MTs grow out of centrosomes [5] and undergo dynamic instability [6] : they switch stochastically between phases of growth and shrinkage [7, 8] .\nMicrotubules also interact strongly with motors [9] . In particular kinesin-1 [10] walks processively along the MT [11] while dyneins [12] pull on it [13] . Motors generate forces which cause MTs to buckle [14, 15] and deform [16] . It has been suggested [17] that these interactions could lead to mechanical instabilities [18] and even catastrophe [19] . However, little is known about the mechanics of individual MTs under load [20] .\nIn this Letter we use optical tweezers [21] to measure the elastic properties of single MTs [22] . We show that MTs are very stiff against bending but soft when stretched. We demonstrate that MTs can be bent into ring-like structures [23] without breaking [24] . Finally, we observe relaxation after bending [25] suggesting that MTs contain internal stresses [26] .

{"text":"We present new results on thermal inertia measurements of NEAs based on infrared observations with Spitzer Space Telescope (SST). We use these data to derive an improved estimate of the mean value of the surface thermal inertia, I = 100 \u00b1 50 J m-2 s-1\/2 K-1, which is in good agreement with previous estimates obtained by other authors using different methods. The derived values are also consistent with laboratory experiments performed at high temperatures that show how the thermal conductivity decreases as temperature increases. Using our measured range of thermal inertias we calculate the expected range of magnitudes of the Yarkovsky force acting upon NEAs. Our calculations suggest that this force may be responsible for driving some NEAs into orbits crossing Earth's orbit. This would have important consequences for future space missions aimed at deflecting potentially hazardous objects away from Earth. Near-Earth Asteroids (NEAs) represent a significant threat to human civilization because they can impact the Earth within one million years. In order to mitigate such threats it will be necessary to develop technologies capable of deflecting or redirecting NEAs out of their current orbits before they hit the Earth. One possible method involves applying a small impulse to the asteroid's trajectory through the action of the Yarkovsky-O'Keefe-Radzievskii-Paddack (YORP) effect. However, the effectiveness of this approach depends critically on the ability to predict accurately the strength of the YORP effect."}

The former type has been found previously only in CVs but not in X-ray binaries or AGNs. In addition we have discovered new unstable modes which were not reported before. These include g-modes excited by the tidal potential at large radii as well as p-modes excited by the radial component of the viscous stress tensor near the inner edge of the disk. Our results show that these newly found modes can be observed in both CVs and X-ray binaries if their mass transfer rates are high enough. \n \n Keywords: Global disk oscillations"}
{"text":"In this work, we propose an algorithm for blind identification (BI) of distributed antenna systems (DASs). The proposed BI method is based on the joint use of second-order statistics and higher order cumulants to estimate the number of active users in each cell as well as their carrier frequency offsets (CFOs), which are unknown parameters that need to be estimated before data detection can take place. We show by simulation results that our proposed method outperforms existing methods in terms of bit error rate performance when CFOs exist between different cells. In addition, it has lower computational complexity than other algorithms. \n \n Keywords: Blind identification; Distributed antenna systems; Second-order statistics; Higher order cumulants; CFO estimation. 1 Introduction \n \n With the rapid development of wireless communication technology, there have been increasing demands for high spectral efficiency and reliable transmission over limited bandwidth resources [1] . To meet these requirements, multi-antenna techniques such as multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) [2] , massive MIMO [3] - [5] , cooperative relaying [6] , and cognitive radio [7] have attracted much attention recently. Among them, distributed antenna systems (DAs) [8] - [10] provide significant advantages including improved coverage area, enhanced capacity, reduced power consumption, and increased network flexibility [11] . However, DAs also introduce new challenges due to the fact that they operate under non-coherent conditions [12] . For example, the channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter side cannot be obtained directly through uplink training or downlink feedback [13] . Therefore, how to obtain CSI accurately becomes one of the most important issues in DA design [14] .\n \nTo address this issue, several works [15] - [17] have investigated the problem of estimating the number of active users and their corresponding channels simultaneously using only statistical properties of received signals without requiring any prior knowledge about the transmitted symbols. These approaches exploit the inherent sparseness property of user activity patterns and utilize second-order statistics (SOS) and\/or higher order cumulants (HOCs) [18] - [20] to identify the number of active users per cell.

{"text":"We present the relativistic second order perturbation theory for fluids in curved space-time with arbitrary number of components. We derive the general expression for the energy-momentum tensor at first order in perturbations as well as its trace-free part which is responsible for gravitational waves generation. The evolution equations are derived by projecting the conservation law onto the background 4-velocity vector field. In particular we show that the presence of anisotropic stress leads to an additional source term in the equation governing the evolution of scalar modes. Finally, we discuss how our formalism can be applied to study different physical situations such as inflationary models or dark matter halos formation. Cosmology has been revolutionized over the past decade thanks to precision measurements of temperature fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation [1] . These observations have provided us with detailed information about the early universe and allowed to test fundamental physics on very large scales [2] .\nThe standard model of cosmology assumes that the universe consists of several interacting components including cold dark matter (CDM), baryons, photons, neutrinos etc.. Each component evolves according to some set of hydrodynamical equations describing their dynamics [3] . However, these equations cannot be solved analytically even if one neglects all interactions between particles [4] , so numerical simulations are required [5] . On the other hand, analytical solutions exist only under certain approximations [6] . For example, it was shown recently [7, 8] that the effect of pressure gradients may lead to significant corrections to the growth rate of density perturbations during the late stages of structure formation [9] ."}
{"text":"We present highly resolved numerical simulations of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with the LANS-alpha model, which is known to produce good results for wall-bounded flows at low Reynolds numbers. We show that this method can also be used in high-Reynolds number situations where it produces accurate results even though its underlying assumptions are not valid anymore. The main advantage over standard LES methods lies in the fact that no explicit subgrid-scale models have to be introduced. This makes the approach very attractive since there is no need to tune any parameters or coefficients as required by other LES approaches. In addition we demonstrate how the LANS-alpha method can be combined with an implicit LES scheme based on the variational multiscale formulation (VMS-LES) to obtain more efficient computations. Finally, we discuss some open issues related to the use of these schemes in practical applications. Turbulence plays a crucial role in many physical phenomena ranging from weather prediction to oceanic circulation and combustion processes. However, despite decades of research turbulence still remains one of the most challenging problems in computational fluid dynamics. One reason for this difficulty is due to the wide range of length scales involved in turbulent flows. While large eddies contain most of the kinetic energy they only occupy a small fraction of the total volume. On the other hand smaller eddies fill up almost all space but contribute little to the overall kinetic energy. Therefore, if one wants to resolve all relevant flow structures accurately enough then extremely fine grids would be needed leading to prohibitively expensive calculations. To overcome this problem so-called Large Eddy Simulations (LESs) were developed during the last two decades [1, 2] . These techniques aim at resolving only those large-scale motions responsible for the bulk of the kinetic energy while modeling the effect of unresolved small-scale fluctuations using suitable closure relations. Although LES has been successfully applied to various engineering problems [3\u20135] , it suffers from several drawbacks such as the lack of universality of the employed sub-grid scale models [6] .\nIn recent years new classes of LES-like methods have emerged [7\u201310] .

We find that for all models considered here, magnetic fields play an important role during the formation process of black holes. The final mass of the central object is determined by the strength of the magnetic field. For weak magnetic fields (B < 10^10 G), we obtain stellar-mass black holes; while for stronger fields (B > 10^{10}G), supermassive black holes form. In addition to this effect on the final mass, magnetic fields also affect the angular momentum distribution inside the collapsing star. This leads to different spin parameters of the resulting black hole depending on its progenitor's initial mass. \n \n Keywords: Black Hole, Primordial Star Formation, Magnetohydrodynamics"}

This allows one to obtain solutions that are valid at any distance between interacting objects.

We show how it can be used to calculate cross sections for different types of atoms (hydrogen-like ions) and compare them with those calculated within other approaches. \n \n Keywords: Elastic Scattering, Cross Section, Electron Atom Collision, R-Matrix Theory, Effective Interaction Potential, Hydrogen-Like Ions. 1 Introduction \n \n The problem of calculating cross section for elastic electron-atom collision has been studied extensively during last decades both theoretically and experimentally [1] .

All these methods allow one to find analytical expressions for the total cross section but they require some additional assumptions about the form of the wave functions or potentials describing the system under investigation. For example, in order to apply the first Born approximation one needs to know the exact solution of Schr\u00f6dinger equation for the initial state of the system while the second Born approximation requires knowledge of the exact wave function for final states only [11] .

{"text":"We study the vulnerability of interdependent networks under cascading failures, where nodes are subject to random attacks and their neighbors can fail as well due to loss of connectivity. We show that dynamic effects increase network vulnerability by enhancing the spreading of failures in time. In particular, we find that increasing the number of attackers or decreasing the recovery rate increases the probability for global cascade failure. Our results suggest that it is important to consider both static and dynamic aspects when studying the robustness of real-world systems against cascading failures. Interdependence between different components of complex systems has been shown to be crucial for understanding many phenomena such as epidemic outbreaks [1] , traffic jams [2] , financial crashes [3] , and blackouts [4] . The recent 2008 power grid crisis caused by an unprecedented series of cascading failures [5] highlighted the importance of considering interdependence among system elements [6] .\nIn this work, we focus on interdependent networks [7, 8] , which consist of two types of nodes: source (S) and target (T). Source nodes provide services to other nodes while target nodes depend on these services. For example, in the case of the power grid, generators supply electricity to substations; if one generator fails then its neighboring substations will also lose power [9] . Similarly, in social networks people may rely on each other's opinions [10] ; if someone becomes ill [11] or loses her job [12] she might affect others' health status [13] or income [14] respectively. Recent studies have shown that interdependency plays an important role in determining the resilience of interconnected systems [15, 16] . However, most previous works focused only on static properties [17] , i.e., they assumed that all links remain stable over time [18] . This assumption does not hold true in practice since links often break down [19] and new ones form [20] . Therefore, it is necessary to take into account the dynamics of interactions [21] ."}

These findings suggest that the observed spectral changes can be explained as being due to variable obscuration effects caused by clouds moving across our line-of-sight towards the central engine.

For example, for electrons (mass m = 9.11\u00d710-31 kg) it equals to 0.5 MeV. Below this threshold there are no effects caused by higher-spin particles.

In particular, the influence of various types of atoms [2] , molecules [3] , ions [4] , plasmas [5] , crystals [6] , etc., on the properties of light was investigated. However, despite numerous studies, the question about how the presence of particles with non-zero spin affects the polarization state of light remains open [7 -9] .\nIn recent decades, interest in such problems increased significantly due to the development of quantum optics [10] . This area includes investigations into the processes occurring when high-energy photons interact with particles having different masses [11] . Such phenomena include Compton scattering [12] , pair production [13] , photo-meson production [14] , etc.. It should also be noted that these processes play an important role in astrophysics [15] , nuclear physics [16] , condensed-matter physics [17] , etc..\nIt follows from the above that the investigation of the impact of particles with nonzero spin on the polarization state of light is relevant both theoretically and experimentally."}
{"text":"We present near-infrared photometry for brown dwarfs (BDs) with masses below 0.075 Msun, members of the young open cluster Lambda Orionis. We find that these BDs have redder J-K colors than field objects at similar spectral types. This is consistent with previous studies showing that low mass stars and BDs are more dusty than higher mass counterparts. The observed color excesses can be explained by accretion disks around the BDs. Using our data we estimate disk fractions between 20-50% among the lowest mass BDs in this sample. These results suggest that most BDs form via core accretion as do high-mass stars. However, it remains unclear whether or not all BDs accrete material to become fully fledged planets. In addition, we show that there may exist two populations of very-low mass BDs: one population which has been affected by accretion processes during its formation; another population whose properties resemble those of older field BDs."}

We use two sets of simulated data: one set generated numerically for equal-mass non-spinning black-hole binaries; another set produced analytically under the restricted post-Newtonian approximation. The latter is used as input into several families of approximate GW templates that are commonly employed in searches for compact-binary mergers. For each template family we perform a Bayesian parameter-estimation study on both synthetic datasets, varying the total mass M , dimensionless spin magnitude \u03c71z = |\u03c71|\/M2, inclination angle \u03b9 between orbital angular momentum vector and line-of-sight, polarization angle \u03c80, sky position angles \u03b8S and \u03c6S, time-of-arrival t0, phase offset \u2206\u03a60, and amplitude A.

However, there exist significant differences among them regarding how well they recover these parameters."}

Lasota for useful discussions on numerical relativity simulations. \n \n Introduction \n \n Supermassive black holes (SBHs), with masses ranging from $10^{6}$ to $10^{10}$ solar mass, reside at the center of most galaxies [1]. They have been found to exist in pairs or even clusters [2] , indicating that SBHs grow through multiple merger events [3] . During these processes, SBHs lose their angular momenta due to gravitational radiation emission [4] . As a result, they will eventually merge into one single object [5] .\n \nThe final stage of the merger process involves two spinning BHs orbiting each other [6] . Due to strong gravitational fields near the horizon, the Kerr metric [7] should be used instead of general relativity [8] . However, since the orbits of merging BHs are highly eccentric [9] , the effects of higher-order corrections to the Kerr solution become important [10] . These corrections include both post-Newtonian [11] terms and those arising from quantum gravity [12] . \n \n It has been shown that the inclusion of these corrections leads to precession of the orbital planes [13] . For example, if the initial spin vectors of the two BHs lie along the same axis but point opposite directions, then the orbital plane will precess around the total angular momentum vector [14] . If the initial spin axes are not aligned with the total angular momentum vector, then the orbital plane may undergo several complete rotations"}

The main idea behind our proof is to use amortized analysis techniques to bound the number of times we have to update the heap's size during each step of the algorithm. This allows us to prove that the total cost incurred over all steps is bounded by O(n log n). In addition, we also provide experimental evidence showing that our theoretical bounds are tight up to constant factors. \nIntroduction\n\nThe Fibonacci-heap data type was introduced by Fredman and Tarjan [FT86] as part of their work on efficient algorithms for finding minimum spanning trees (MSTs), shortest paths, and other related problems. It consists of a rooted binary tree with two additional fields associated with every node: its parent pointer and its rank value. Every node stores pointers to its left child and right child nodes; however, unlike ordinary binary trees, there can be more than one node with the same key stored under any given node. Each node maintains a counter called its rank, which indicates how many keys equal to or less than the key of the current node exist below it; if no such key exists then the rank field contains zero. \n \n For example, consider the following Fibonacci-heap storing the values 1 through 5:"}
{"text":"We study critical edge behavior for certain classes of unitary random matrices, which are related to the so-called \\(\\Gamma\\) ensemble introduced by Dyson. We show that the distribution function of the largest eigenvalue is given by an explicit formula involving the thirty-fourth Painleve transcendent. This result can be viewed as a generalization of Tracy-Widom's famous theorem on the asymptotic distribution of the largest eigenvalue of Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE). The proof relies heavily on the fact that the corresponding probability density functions have compact support. As applications we obtain new results about the number variance and the spacing between consecutive eigenvalues near the edge. In particular, our analysis leads to a simple expression for the leading order term of the number variance at the edge. \nIntroduction\n\nThe main purpose of this work is to investigate the statistical properties of the largest eigenvalue of some classes of unitary random matrices. These matrices appear naturally when one considers the scattering theory associated with Schr\u00f6dinger operators with point interactions [21, 22] . They also arise in connection with the so-called \\(\\Phi\\) ensemble studied recently by Jimbo et al. [17] , where they were used to describe the statistics of zeros of Riemann zeta-functions. More generally, these matrices play important roles in various branches of mathematics such as integrable systems, combinatorics, number theory and mathematical physics [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41] .\nIn recent years there has been considerable interest in studying the statistical properties of the spectrum of large dimensional random matrices [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] .

{"text":"The information-based asset pricing model is an extension to the traditional CAPM (Capital Assets Pricing Model) that incorporates additional factors into its analysis.  The first factor, market risk premium, represents the excess return investors demand for holding risky assets over and above their returns on low-risk investments such as Treasury bills or bonds.   The second factor, size effect, captures differences in expected returns between small-cap stocks and large-cap stocks.   The third factor, value effect, measures the difference in returns between high book-to-market ratio stocks and low book-to-market ratio stocks; this factor has been shown to be particularly important during periods when interest rates are falling.    This article provides a brief overview of these three factors along with some examples of how they can affect investment decisions. The Capital Assets Pricing Model (CAPM), developed by Sharpe (1964), Lintner (1965), Mossin (1966), and Black (1972), is one of the most widely used models in finance today.  It states that the expected rate of return on any given security should equal the sum of two components - the risk-free rate plus a risk premium associated with the level of systematic risk inherent in each security.  In other words, if you hold a portfolio consisting only of risk-free securities then your expected return will simply be the risk-free rate; however, if you hold a diversified portfolio containing both risky and non-risky securities then your expected rate of return will increase proportionately with the amount of risk you take on.  For example, suppose we have a hypothetical investor who holds a portfolio consisting of 50% U.S. Treasury bills and 50% Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index Funds.

{"text":"We study spontaneous breaking of dilatation symmetry and its effects on the fifth force problem, which is one of the most important problems in particle physics today. We show that if we assume dilatation symmetry to be spontaneously broken at some scale $\\Lambda$ then there are no new light degrees of freedom associated with this symmetry breaking. In other words, all particles predicted by our model have masses larger than $\\Lambda$. This solves the fifth force problem because any additional light degree of freedom would contribute to the fifth force. The only exception is gravitons whose massless nature does not allow them to decay into lighter states. However, their contribution to the fifth force can be suppressed by choosing appropriate values for the parameters of the theory. Finally, we discuss possible experimental signatures of our scenario.

{"text":"We study the generation of large-scale magnetic fields in astrophysical plasmas with very small values of the magnetic Prandtl number, Pm = \u03bd\/\u03b7 \u226a 1 (\u03bd is viscosity, \u03b7 is resistivity). We consider two different types of flows that are relevant for this problem -helically driven turbulence and convection-driven turbulence. In both cases we find that the mean electromotive force has contributions from several terms which scale differently as functions of the Reynolds number Re = UL\/\u03bd and the magnetic Reynolds number Rm = URm\/\u03b7. Here U , L, and Rm are characteristic velocity, length, and magnetic field scales respectively.  For helically driven turbulence these contributions can be grouped into three categories:  The first category includes all terms proportional to Re(Rm)\u22121\/2 . These terms have been studied previously by many authors using various approaches including direct numerical simulations. They represent the contribution of the so-called \u03b1-effect due to helical motions. The second category contains all terms proportional to Re1\/2 (Rm)\u22121\/4 . This term represents the effect of helicity on the nonlinear evolution of the magnetic fluctuations. Finally, there exists also an additional third category containing all terms proportional to Re3\/4 (Rm)\u22123\/8 . It describes the influence of helicity on the linear growth rate of the magnetic fluctuations."}
{"text":"We study the evolution of cooperation among agents with different sizes, where each agent can choose between two strategies: cooperate or defect. We show that there is an optimal strategy for cooperators to adopt when they are surrounded by defectors; this strategy depends on their own size as well as those of their neighbours. In particular, we find that small cooperators should always defect while large ones should always cooperate if they have at least one neighbour who also cooperates. This result suggests that cooperative clusters may form spontaneously even though all individuals would be better off defecting. Finally, we demonstrate how our results can be used to explain some recent experimental findings. The evolutionary game theory has been widely applied to understand the emergence of cooperation [1\u20133] . However, most existing models assume homogeneous populations [4\u20136] , which cannot capture many real-world situations [7\u20139] .\nIn fact, it has recently been shown that population structure plays an important role in promoting cooperation [10\u201312] . For example, spatial structures such as lattices [13] , random graphs [14] , scale-free networks [15] , and complex networks [16] can enhance cooperation significantly [17] . Moreover, heterogeneous populations [18, 19] , including structured populations [20, 21] , can further promote cooperation [22] . Therefore, understanding the effect of population structure and size heterogeneity on cooperation will help us gain insights into the evolution of cooperation more generally [23] .\nHerein, we consider a model consisting of N agents arranged on a square lattice [24] . Each agent i (i = 1, ..., N) can either cooperate (C) or defect (D). Agents interact locally with their four nearest neighbours [25] . At every time step t, each agent interacts with its four neighbours simultaneously [26] ; then, it adopts the strategy of the majority of them [27] .

{"text":"We study the fractal dimension of domain walls (DWs) in two dimensional Ising spin glasses with nearest neighbor interactions and random bonds using Monte Carlo simulations at finite temperatures. We find that DWs are fractals for all values of temperature studied here, i.e., T = 0.5J\/kB to 1.2J\/kB where J is the strength of interaction between spins on neighboring sites.  The fractal dimensions obtained by box counting method agree well with those determined by the correlation function analysis. In addition we show that the fractal dimension decreases as the temperature increases. This result suggests that the structure of DWs becomes more complicated when the system approaches its critical point. Finally it should be noted that our results can also be applied to other systems such as vortex lines in type-II superconductors or dislocation networks in crystals. Two-dimensional Ising spin glasses have been extensively investigated both experimentally [1] and theoretically [2] . It has been shown that these models exhibit many interesting phenomena including phase transitions [3] , spin-glass states [4] , and glassy dynamics [5] .\nIn this work we focus on one particular aspect of the model which is the fractal nature of domain walls [6] . Domain wall refers to an interface separating different ordered phases [7, 8] . For example, in ferromagnetic materials there exist two types of domains; up and down magnetization [9] . These domains are separated by interfaces called domain walls [10] . Similarly, in antiferromagnets [11] , there exists four possible orientations of magnetic moments [12] ; three of them form triangular sublattices while the fourth forms a square lattice [13] . Therefore, there will be six types of domain walls [14] ."}

{"text":"The self-consistent approach to the description of nuclear matter is reviewed and its application to other systems, such as atomic nuclei or quark-gluon plasma, discussed briefly. The main idea behind this method is that one should not consider only the mean field acting on particles but also take into account fluctuations around it. This leads to an infinite set of coupled equations for all orders of correlation functions which can be solved by truncation at some order. In particular we discuss how the results depend on the choice of the approximation scheme used. We show that the inclusion of higher-order correlations improves agreement with experimental data considerably. Finally, we present our recent results obtained within the framework of the relativistic random phase approximation (RRPA) including up to fourth-order correlations. These calculations are performed using realistic nucleonnucleon interactions derived from chiral effective theory. It turns out that the RRPA results agree well with available experimental information about excited states of medium-heavy nuclei."}

{"text":"We report on the adhesion force between two surfaces made out of the same material, which is caused by triboelectric charging and electrostatic attraction. The experiments are performed with silicon wafers in ambient air at room temperature using an atomic force microscope (AFM). We find that the measured adhesion force increases linearly with increasing normal load applied to the AFM tip. This behavior can be explained by considering the contact area as well as the charge density distribution across this area. In addition we show how the adhesion force depends on the relative humidity. Finally, we discuss possible applications for our findings. Tribology deals with friction, wear and lubrication phenomena occurring when solid bodies slide against each other or deform elastically under pressure [1] . It has been known since the 19th century that sliding friction causes electric charges [2] , but only recently it was realized that these charges play an important role in tribological processes [3] .\nIn particular, it has been shown that tribocharging leads to strong adhesive interactions between solids [4] . These effects have been observed experimentally [5, 6] and theoretically [7, 8] . However, most studies so far focused on dissimilar materials such as metals and insulators [9] .

{"text":"We study how the effects of galactic winds can be used to explain the observed properties of the metal-poor tail in the stellar metallicity distributions (SMDs) of nearby dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSph). We find that SMD is sensitive to both the mass loss rate and wind velocity, but not very sensitive to other parameters such as the initial mass function or star formation history. The best-fit model for each galaxy has been obtained by comparing its SMD with those predicted using different sets of free parameters. Our results show that all these dSph have experienced strong outflows driven by supernovae explosions during their early evolution stages. These outflows are responsible for removing most metals produced by stars formed before z = 1.5-2.0. In addition, we also found that some of them may experience additional late-time outflow events which could remove more metals produced after this time period."}
{"text":"We report on the electronic structure and magnetic properties of zigzag graphene nanoribbons (ZGNRs) with different edge structures, including hydrogenated ZGNR (H-ZGNR), fluorinated ZGNR (F-ZGNR), oxygenated ZGNR (O-ZGNR), and nitrogen-doped O-ZGNR (N-ZGNR). We find that all these ZGNRs are half-metals except for H-ZGNR which is metallic. The band gaps of F-ZGNR and N-ZGNR increase as compared to those of pristine ZGNR due to the electronegativity difference between carbon atoms at edges and their neighbors. In contrast, the band gap decreases slightly when oxygen replaces one or two carbon atoms at each edge because of charge transfer from oxygen to neighboring carbon atom(s). Our results show that the spin polarization can be enhanced by introducing oxygen into the edges of ZGNRs."}
{"text":"We have read with interest the recent preprint [1] . In this work we find that the authors' claim to set an upper bound on the lifetime of the electron is not justified because they did not take into account all relevant decay channels. \n \n We would like to comment briefly on their treatment of backgrounds as well as their choice of cuts used to select events. The main source of background comes from radiative Bhabha scattering e+e-\u2192e+e-\u03b3 which has been studied extensively at LEP2 [2] , where it was found to be negligible compared to other sources such as two-photon processes or four-fermion final states (e.g., W pair production). This process can only contribute if one photon escapes detection; however, since photons are emitted almost collinearly with electrons\/positrons, the probability of missing both photons is very small. Furthermore, the cross section for this process decreases rapidly when the invariant mass of the lepton pairs increases [3] .\n \nThe authors also use a cut on the total energy of the event, Evis>10 GeV, which removes most of these events. They do mention that there may still be some residual contamination due to radiative Bhabhas but argue that this will be suppressed by requiring the presence of additional jets. However, even though the jet multiplicity distribution does decrease slightly after applying this requirement, the effect is too small to compensate for the loss of signal efficiency caused by removing events with low visible energies. \n \nIn addition, the authors state that the contribution from radiative Bhabhas should be included in the systematic uncertainty estimate. However, this statement is misleading given that the quoted systematic error already includes contributions from many different sources including those related to the modelling of initial-state radiation [4] . \n\n\nFinally, we note that the authors present results obtained using Monte Carlo simulations performed with PYTHIA 6 [5] .

We detect all sources in our sample with high signal-to-noise ratio using the Atacama Large Millimeter\/submillimeter Array (ALMA). The observed spectral energy distributions are well-fit by models that include both synchrotron emission from relativistic jets and thermal dust emission heated by star formation activity. Our results show that these high-redshift quasars have properties similar to those seen in lower-redshift counterparts. These findings suggest that massive black holes grow rapidly during this early epoch of cosmic time. This work is based on data obtained as part of ALMA program 2013.1.00010.S. Millimeter-wave and radio observations provide important insights into the physical processes occurring within distant galaxies. In particular, they can be used to study the growth history of supermassive black holes (SMBHs), which power active galactic nuclei (AGNs).\nIn recent years, several SMBH candidates have been discovered at redshifts greater than six through their strong rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) continua [1] . However, it remains unclear how such objects evolve over cosmological timescales because there has not yet been any direct detection of AGN signatures associated with them [2] .\nThe most promising method for detecting AGN signatures involves observing the mm-wavelength continuum produced by hot electrons accelerated along magnetic field lines in relativistic jets [3] , or via the free-free emission from ionized gas surrounding the central engine [4] .

{"text":"We report on the observation of vortex formation in two trapped condensates that are merged together using an optical lattice potential. The merging process is accompanied by the appearance of dark solitons, which can be identified as topological defects in the density distribution of each individual condensate. We show how these defects evolve into vortices during the merger process. In addition to this direct route towards vortex generation we also demonstrate another method for creating vortices based on interference between multiple condensates. This second approach allows us to create stable vortex states with high winding numbers (up to 12). Our results provide new insights into the dynamics of interacting quantum fluids at low temperatures. Vortices play an important role in many areas of physics ranging from superfluid helium [1] , liquid crystals [2] or superconductors [3] over atomic gases [4] up to astrophysics [5] . They represent topologically non-trivial solutions of nonlinear wave equations [6] and have been observed experimentally in various systems [7, 8] .\nIn recent years there has been considerable interest in studying vortex structures in ultracold atoms [9] . These systems offer several advantages compared to other physical realizations such as their tunability [10] , controllability [11] and clean experimental conditions [12] . For example, it was shown recently that one-dimensional arrays of vortices can be created in a single condensate [13] . However, most experiments so far were restricted to observing only few isolated vortices [14, 15] due to technical limitations [16] .

{"text":"We present results for bound state calculations in three dimensions using the Yakubovsky equations including realistic nuclear potentials and three-body forces. The Yakubovsky equations are derived by solving the Faddeev-Yakubovsky integral equation iteratively, which is equivalent to solving the Schr\u00f6dinger equation directly but requires less computational effort. We use two different methods to solve these equations numerically; one method uses an expansion into hyperspherical harmonics while another employs a basis set consisting of Gaussian wave packets. In both cases we include all partial waves up to angular momentum L = 20. For comparison purposes we also perform calculations without three-body forces. Our numerical results show that the binding energies obtained within our approach agree well with those calculated previously employing other techniques such as variational Monte Carlo or Green's function Monte Carlo.

The ability to acquire accurate three-dimensional (3D) information at high frame rates opens up new possibilities in many fields including remote sensing, medical diagnostics, surveillance, robotics, etc., where fast response times are required [1] . Among all available technologies, stereo vision stands out due to its low cost and simplicity [2] , but it suffers from inherent limitations related to the need of having textured surfaces within the scene [3] .\nIn recent years, several alternatives have emerged to overcome this problem [4] - [6] . One of them consists of using multiple images taken simultaneously from slightly displaced viewpoints [7] . This approach allows one to recover depth maps even if there is no texture in the scene [8] . However, the accuracy achieved depends strongly on the baseline between the camera positions [9] . Another possibility relies on the use of active illumination [10] , although this solution may not always be practical because of safety concerns [11] .

The presence of such material is consistent with theoretical expectations for post-low-velocity-bulge (post-LBV) Wolf-Rayet star winds. In addition we detect narrow emission features which are likely due to interaction between SN ejecta and this wind.

The majority of our sample is found to be obscured by dusty torii, as indicated by their optical colors and infrared emission. These results suggest that there may exist two populations of AGN: one which hosts significant amounts of star formation, and another where no such activity is observed.

{"text":"We show that all known schemes for dimensional reduction can be derived as special cases of the general covariance breaking (GCB) mechanism, which is based on spontaneous symmetry breaking in quantum field theory and has been applied to many areas including particle physics, condensed matter physics, statistical mechanics, and cosmology.

Here we provide additional examples of this scheme, some of them not considered before. These include models coming from gauge theories with fermionic fields or supersymmetric theories.

We find that the spectrum can be fit equally well using either blackbody or power-law models; however, we cannot rule out other spectral shapes such as thermal bremsstrahlung. In addition to the point source at the position of the pulsar, there appears to be diffuse emission surrounding it. This may arise from hot plasma trapped between the pulsar's magnetosphere and the stellar surface. If this interpretation is correct then our results suggest that the magnetic field lines connecting the two stars have been disrupted by tidal forces during their close passage through periastron. Finally, we discuss possible origins for the unusually high spin-down rate inferred for PSR B1257 + 12 based on radio timing measurements."}
{"text":"We study the third-order cosmological perturbation theory for a zero pressure multicomponent fluid in an expanding universe with arbitrary spatial curvature and anisotropic stress. We derive the exact expressions for all relevant quantities up to third order, including the gauge-invariant density contrasts, velocity divergence, shear tensor, vorticity vector, energy fluxes, and anisotropic stresses. The results are presented in terms of the background evolution equations as well as the linear growth rate functions. In particular, we show that there is no pure GR contribution at second order but only at third order. This implies that any detection of such effects would be a clear signature of modified gravity theories beyond GR. Finally, we discuss some applications of our formalism to specific models of dark matter and dark energy. Cosmology has been one of the most successful areas of modern physics. It provides us not only with important information about the early history of the Universe, but also serves as a powerful tool to test fundamental physical laws on large scales. However, it is now widely believed that standard cosmology based on Einstein's General Relativity (GR) cannot explain many observed phenomena, especially those related to late-time cosmic acceleration [1] . Therefore, alternative theoretical frameworks have been proposed over the past few decades [2] , among which scalar-tensor theories [3] and f(R) gravity [4] are two popular examples. These new theories generally predict different gravitational dynamics than what is predicted by GR, so they can lead to observable deviations from GR predictions [5] .\nIn this work, we will focus on studying the third-order cosmological perturbations of a zero-pressure multi-component system in an expanding universe with spatially curved geometry [6] . Our goal is to provide a complete set of exact solutions for various perturbed quantities up to third order using the covariant approach developed recently [7, 8] . As shown below, these solutions contain both first-and second-order contributions due to the presence of non-vanishing anisotropic stress and spatial curvature [9] . They may therefore serve as useful tools to investigate possible signatures of modified gravity theories beyond"}

We also present an algorithm which solves this problem exactly in time O(n3). Our results are based on reductions from the exact cover by 3-sets (X3C) problem. The X3C problem asks whether there exists a collection of subsets of a set S such that each element of S belongs to exactly 3 sets in the collection; it has been shown to be NP-complete.

{"text":"We present the results of multi-wavelength studies towards southern hot molecular cores (HMCs) using ammonia, water vapour, and continuum data at 1.3 cm and 3 mm wavelengths obtained with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA). The HMCs are associated with high-mass star formation regions in which massive young stellar objects have been detected through infrared surveys. We find that all our targets show compact emission features on scales of 0.1 pc or less. These sources appear to be dense clumps embedded within larger-scale structures extending up to several parsecs. In addition, we detect extended emission components surrounding these compact clumps. Our analysis shows that the physical conditions derived for the compact clumps are consistent with those expected for hot molecular gas heated by protostellar outflows. On the other hand, the properties of the extended emission suggest that it is likely tracing an envelope around each source."}
{"text":"We present the results of an analysis of HST images for a sample of 12 nearby (z<0.1) brightest cluster galaxies with nuclear activity classified as Seyferts in the Palomar spectroscopic survey, and compare them to those obtained for a control sample of 12 inactive galaxies selected by matching their morphological type and luminosity distribution. We find that the AGNs are preferentially located at large galactocentric distances (Rg>10 kpc), where they appear to be associated with extended emission-line regions. The surface brightness profiles show that these objects have flatter cores than normal elliptical galaxies, but steeper outer envelopes. This is consistent with previous studies which found that the central light concentration decreases systematically towards higher levels of nuclear activity.  These findings suggest that the presence of an active nucleus may affect the formation and\/or evolution of the stellar population in its immediate vicinity. In particular, we propose that the flattening of the core could be due to the removal or redistribution of stars caused by tidal interactions between the AGN and surrounding gas clouds."}
{"text":"We prove that the Poincare duality pairs are exactly those which can be obtained by gluing together two copies of the same surface along their boundaries, and we give an explicit description for all such surfaces.  We also show how to construct these surfaces using only elementary operations on polygons with holes.

In this note we study another class of manifolds called Poincare duality pairs: These are simply connected compact oriented 3-manifolds M whose intersection form Q satisfies Q = \u2212Q t . It follows immediately from the definition that if M is a Poincare duality manifold then it has signature zero (i.e., its second Stiefel-Whitney class vanishes)."}
{"text":"The authors have studied the stability of the superconducting state by measuring the temperature dependence of the resistance and magnetic susceptibility for single crystals with different oxygen contents (0.5, 0.6, 0.7). The results show that the critical temperatures T_c decrease as the oxygen content decreases. This is explained by an increase in disorder due to the presence of excess oxygen atoms at low oxygen concentrations.  In addition, it was found that the transition widths are larger than those observed previously on polycrystalline samples. It has been shown that this effect can be attributed to the anisotropy of the crystal lattice. Finally, we note that the behavior of the resistivity near Tc does not depend on the oxygen concentration. We believe that these results will help clarify some aspects of the physics of high-temperature superconductors. High-Tc cuprates are known to exhibit two types of electronic states depending on their doping levels: metallic or insulating [1] . At optimal doping levels they display a superconducting phase which persists up to very high temperatures [2] , while underdoped compounds become insulators [3] .\nIn order to understand better the physical properties of these materials, several studies were performed using various techniques such as: transport measurements [4] , neutron scattering [5] , optical spectroscopy [6] , nuclear quadrupole resonance [7] , muon spin rotation [8] , etc..

{"text":"The universal spectrum is the most important concept in physics and mathematics, which has been widely used to study various physical phenomena such as energy transfer processes in biological systems.  In this work we present an analysis on the universal spectrum of the DNA base CG frequency distribution along the chromosomes of Takifugu rubripe s(pufferfish). We find that there are two different types of universal spectra corresponding to the coding regions and non-coding regions respectively. The universal spectrum of the coding region shows a power law behavior with exponent 1.5 while that of the noncoding region exhibits a fractal structure. Our results show that the universal spectrum can be used to characterize the complexity of the DNA sequence. It may also provide new insights into the understanding of the evolution process of the genomes. Keywords: Universal Spectrum; Fractal; Power Law; Puffer Fish Genome; Energy Transfer Processes. Introduction:  The universal spectrum is one of the most important concepts in physics and mathematics, it was first introduced by Hertz [1] . Since then many scientists have studied its applications in various fields including biology [2] , geology [3] , medicine [4] etc.. Recently, some researchers found that the universal spectrum could be applied to analyze the gene expression data [5] - [8] .\nIn recent years, more and more attention has been paid to the relationship between the universal spectrum and the energy transfer processes in biological system [9] - [11] . For example, Li et al. [12] investigated the universal spectrum of the human heart rate variability and found that the universal spectrum showed a fractal structure. They suggested that the universal spectrum might be useful in characterizing the complexity of the physiological time series. Wang et al. [13] analyzed the universal spectrum of the protein folding dynamics and they found that the universal spectrum exhibited a power-law behavior with exponent 2.0. They proposed that the universal spectrum could reflect the degree of disorderedness of the protein folding dynamics."}
{"text":"The present study examines the cross correlation between stock returns and volatility on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) for the period January 2000 to December 2010 using daily data. The results show that there is significant positive relationship between return-volatility pairs, which implies that past information about one variable can be used to predict future values of another variable. Further analysis reveals that this relationship varies across different market segments as well as over time. In addition, we find evidence of asymmetry in the relationship between returns and volatility. Finally, our findings suggest that the relationship between returns and their corresponding volatilities are not stable but change with changes in economic conditions. This finding has important implications for risk management practices by investors and portfolio managers. Keywords: Volatility, Returns, Correlations, Asymmetries, Economic Conditions, Risk Management Practices. 1 Introduction Investors often use historical information regarding asset prices or returns to make investment decisions. However, it may also be useful to consider how past information about an asset's price movements affects its subsequent volatility. For example, if past information about an asset leads to higher returns then it should lead to greater uncertainty among investors resulting in increased volatility. Similarly, if past information about returns leads to lower returns then it would reduce investor uncertainty leading to reduced volatility. Thus, understanding the nature of the relationship between returns and subsequent volatility could help investors better manage risks associated with their portfolios. A number of studies have examined the relationship between returns and various measures of volatility such as variance, standard deviation, absolute value of returns etc. (see e.g., Engle et al., 1987; Bollerslev et al., 1992; Glosten et al., 1993) . These studies generally report a positive relationship between returns and volatilities suggesting that past information about returns helps explain current levels of volatility."}
{"text":"We present new near-infrared (NIR) spectra for red supergiants and giants, obtained at the European Southern Observatory in La Silla, Chile.  The sample includes stars with spectral types ranging from M5 to M2Iab, luminosity classes III-V, and surface gravities between log g = 1.0 and 3.8 dex. We compare these observations with synthetic NIR spectra computed using MARCS model atmospheres that include mixing-induced chemical abundance changes near the stellar surface. Our results show that models including such effects are able to reproduce most observed features better than standard solar-scaled models. In particular, we find that the inclusion of mixing leads to an improved fit of the CO bandheads around 2.3 microns as well as of several atomic lines. However, some discrepancies remain which may be due to shortcomings in our current understanding of convection or other physical processes occurring close to the stellar surface."}
{"text":"The BFKL equation is an effective theory for describing high-energy scattering processes at small Bjorken-x, where x denotes the fraction of longitudinal momentum carried by one of the colliding hadrons or nuclei. The BFKL formalism has been developed into a practical tool to calculate cross sections and structure functions using numerical methods. In this talk I will present recent results on the calculation of the gluon Green's function within the framework of the so-called \"dipole approach\" which allows us to perform calculations analytically. This method was first introduced by Mueller and Tang in order to study diffractive deep-inelastic scattering (DDIS) off protons. It can be applied also to other processes like heavy quark production in proton-proton collisions as well as photon-photon interactions. We will discuss how we have implemented these ideas numerically and show some preliminary results obtained with our code. Finally, we will comment on possible extensions of this work towards more realistic phenomenological applications."}
{"text":"The authors have studied the growth rate and its fluctuations for different types of human cancer cells grown under controlled conditions, using an automated image analysis system to measure their size over time.  The results show that there is considerable variation between individual clones within each type of cell line as well as between different types of cell lines. This suggests that it may be possible to use this information to classify tumours into subtypes with distinct biological properties. In addition, they find evidence that the growth rates are correlated across generations of daughter cells, which could provide insight into how these correlations arise during tumorigenesis. Finally, by comparing the growth characteristics of normal and transformed cells, they conclude that transformation leads to increased heterogeneity among daughter cells. Cancer is characterized by uncontrolled proliferation of abnormal cells. Understanding the mechanisms underlying this process can help us develop new treatments against cancer. However, studying the dynamics of cancerous cell populations has been challenging because of difficulties associated with tracking large numbers of single cells simultaneously. Here we report our recent work on characterizing the growth behavior of thousands of individual cancer cells growing in culture dishes [1] . We used an automated imaging system to track the sizes of hundreds of thousands of cells belonging to several different types of human cancer cell lines ( Figure 1 ). Our results reveal significant differences in both average growth rates and growth fluctuations between different types of cell lines: some grow faster than others while also exhibiting larger fluctuations around their mean values [2] .\nWe found that the growth rates were highly variable even when measured at the level of individual clones derived from a common parent population [3] , suggesting that the observed phenotypic diversity might reflect genetic or epigenetic variations present in the original parental population [4] .  These findings suggest that it should be possible to use such measurements to classify tumors into subtypes based on their growth characteristics [5] ."}

{"text":"We present an analysis of the colour-selection criteria for identifying high-redshift (z > 6) galaxies using data from the first public release of the UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey (UKIDSS). We use photometric redshifts to select candidate z ~ 7 and 8 galaxies, and then examine their near-infrared colours as measured by UKIDSS. The majority of these candidates are found to be at lower redshift than expected; we find that this is due primarily to contamination by low-redshift interlopers with similar optical-to-near-infrared colours. However, we also identify several robust candidates which have been missed by previous surveys. These include two objects with spectroscopic confirmation of Lyman-break features at z = 7.071 and z = 7.085 respectively. We discuss possible reasons why our sample may differ from those previously published, including differences between the survey areas used and different methods of selecting targets for spectroscopy."}
{"text":"We present new measurements of the total (bulge+disc) galaxy luminosity density in the near-infrared K band, which are used to derive estimates for the mean optical depth of the Universe at redshifts z=0-1.5 using two different methods. The first method uses the observed correlation between the rest-frame UV-optical colours of galaxies and their infrared emission as measured by Spitzer\/IRAC photometry; this is combined with an empirical calibration based on local samples of galaxies to estimate the fraction of obscured star formation activity within each sample. In the second approach we use the observed evolution of the global SFRD inferred from deep extragalactic surveys together with our knowledge of how much of that star formation occurs in optically-thick systems derived from the previous analysis. We find that both approaches yield consistent results over most of the redshift range considered here, yielding values for the mean opacity of the universe ranging from $\\tau \\sim 0.3$ at $z = 0$ to $\\tau \\sim 1.0$ at $z = 1$. These results imply that the amount of dust associated with star-forming regions increases rapidly out to redshifts of order unity before declining again towards higher redshifts."}
{"text":"We present the first exact solution for the axisymmetric, stationary and force-free magnetic field structure around a rapidly-rotating neutron star with arbitrary inclination angle between its rotation and magnetic axes. The model is based on the assumption that the stellar surface is covered by a thin layer of plasma which corotates with the star at all latitudes. We show how this solution can be used to calculate the X-ray light curves produced by hot spots located at different latitudes above the stellar surface. In particular we demonstrate that the observed phase shifts between the peaks of soft X-rays (0.5-2 keV) and hard X-rays (2-10 keV), as well as their relative amplitudes are reproduced very accurately if one assumes that both emission components originate from two antipodal hot spots located near the magnetic poles. This result suggests that the observed X-ray pulsations may be caused by the rotational modulation of the local emissivity rather than by the Doppler effect due to bulk motion of matter within the emitting regions. \n \n Keywords: Force-free fields, Pulsar wind nebulae"}
{"text":"We present the first detection of absorption lines in the rest-frame ultraviolet spectrum of two galaxies at redshifts z = 2.3 and 3.1, which are likely to be associated with outflows driven by star formation activity. The observed properties of these winds are consistent with those predicted for massive (M > 1010 M\u2299) star-forming galaxies at similar redshifts. We also find evidence that the gas is being accelerated up to velocities as large as 1000 km s-1 . These results suggest that such winds may play an important role in regulating galaxy evolution over cosmic time.  Keywords: Galaxy Evolution; Star Formation; Winds Galaxies evolve through mergers and interactions between their constituent dark matter halos and baryonic components. In addition, they grow via accretion onto existing structures or by forming new stars within them. However, it remains unclear how this growth proceeds on small scales. Recent observations have shown that many nearby galaxies contain supermassive black holes surrounded by dense gaseous disks. It has been suggested that feedback processes involving jets and\/or winds produced by active galactic nuclei can regulate both the growth of the central black hole and its host galaxy. This process could explain why most galaxies do not appear to harbour supermassive black holes whose masses exceed the upper limit set by the relation between black-hole mass and bulge velocity dispersion."}

{"text":"We present fitting formulae for the illumination of accretion disks by hot spots, as seen in Schwarzschild and rotating black holes (Kerr). The formulae are derived using ray tracing through the disk atmosphere with an approximate treatment of Compton scattering. We find that the dependence on the spin parameter is weak when the spot size is small compared to the radius at which photons decouple from matter. For larger spots we find that the effect increases strongly towards prograde spins. Our results can be used to estimate the effects of relativistic Doppler boosting and gravitational lensing on observed spectra. They may also provide useful input into models of X-ray reflection spectroscopy. \nIntroduction\n\nAccreting black holes produce bright emission lines in their X-ray spectrum due to reprocessing of hard X-rays emitted near the event horizon by cold material orbiting close to the equatorial plane. These features have been studied extensively over many years both observationally and theoretically (see Reynolds & Nowak 2003 , Done et al 2004 . In particular, they show strong red-shifts indicating that the emitting gas orbits rapidly around the black hole. This rapid rotation causes additional shifts in energy due to relativistic Doppler boosts and gravitational lensing. Relativistic effects become more important if the emitting region has a high degree of rotational support or is viewed nearly face-on. It is therefore necessary to take these effects into account when interpreting observations of such systems. \n\nIn this work we consider the case where the illuminating source is located above the disk surface but below its photosphere. Such sources include magnetic flares produced within the disk itself or active regions associated with the inner edge of the disk. We assume that the disk is optically thick so that all radiation reaching it is absorbed and re-emitted locally. We use Monte Carlo simulations to calculate the emergent flux from the disk under various assumptions about the geometry of the system.\n\nThe main goal of our study was to develop simple analytical expressions describing how the shape of the line profile depends on the properties of the system. To do this we performed extensive numerical calculations covering a wide range"}
{"text":"We present an analysis method for characterizing the stability of optical phase in astronomical instruments, based on the measurement and characterization of fringe contrasts obtained with different integration times.  We show that this method can be used to characterize both short-term (< 1 hour) and long-term (> 24 hours) instrumental instabilities. The results are compared against those obtained using other methods such as power spectral density or Allan variance measurements. This new technique is applied to data taken at the Palomar Observatory Interferometer during commissioning runs in 2007-2008. It allows us to identify specific sources of instability which could not have been detected by previous techniques. In particular we find that the main source of instability comes from atmospheric turbulence effects rather than mechanical vibrations.

In particular, we prove that computing an unbiased estimator of the expectation of any function f under the posterior distribution requires at least $O(n^{1 - \\epsilon} \\log n)$ time using $\\epsilon$-MCMC methods such as Metropolis-Hastings or Gibbs sampling, where $\\epsilon > 0$ is some constant depending only on the dimension d of the parameter space.

This result suggests that there are two populations of dusty star-forming regions within each galaxy -one population associated with normal star formation activity and another one associated with intense bursts of star formation.

The results show that most of these galaxies are bulge-dominated systems with high central concentration indices (n > 2). In addition, we find that there is no significant correlation between galaxy luminosity or size and its S\u00e9rsic index. Finally, by comparing our results with those obtained for other samples of massive early-type galaxies at different redshifts, we conclude that LCGs have similar sizes but higher concentrations than local elliptical galaxies."}
{"text":"We present the first results on Spitzer infrared spectroscopy (IRS) observations of four Galactic supernova remnants, G11.2\u22120.3, Kes 17, RCW 103, and W44. The main goal is to study their physical conditions in detail by analyzing the observed emission lines with non-LTE radiative transfer models. We find that all these objects are dominated by dense molecular gas at temperatures between 100 K and 300 K. In addition we detect atomic hydrogen emission lines which indicate the presence of hotter plasma components. For two sources, Kes 17 and W44, we also observe strong [O III] emission indicating shock-heated ionized gas. Finally, for one source, Kes 17, we identify an additional cold dust component at T = 20 K. This work demonstrates the power of mid-infrared spectroscopy as a tool to investigate the physics of supernova remnants. It will be followed up by detailed studies of individual targets using more sophisticated modeling techniques. \n \n Keywords: Supernova Remnant, Mid-Infrared Spectroscopy"}
{"text":"We present results on metal and molecular gas cooling in cosmological hydrodynamic simulations with the Enzo code, focusing on the effects of different numerical schemes for solving the energy equation (SPH vs. grid-based) as well as varying physical prescriptions for star formation feedback. We find that SPH codes tend to overestimate the amount of cold gas at high redshifts compared to grid-based methods due to artificial viscosity heating. Feedback models which include galactic winds are able to suppress this effect by removing low entropy material from galaxies. However, we also show that these wind models can lead to an underestimation of the total mass fraction of cool gas if they remove too much hot halo gas around massive halos. Overall our results suggest that current state-of-the-art galaxy formation models produce reasonable estimates for the global properties of the warm-hot intergalactic medium but may still be missing important physics related to the detailed distribution of metals within individual galaxies."}
{"text":"The Large Area Telescope (LAT) on board Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope is scheduled to be launched in June 2008 and will perform high energy gamma ray astronomy for at least 3 years. The LAT consists of 4 identical towers, each with tracker and calorimeter subsystems. Each tower has an anti-coincidence detector that covers its entire surface area. In addition there are two instruments dedicated to detecting bursts of gamma rays -the GBM and the LAT itself. The GBM is composed of 12 sodium iodide scintillation crystals read out by photomultiplier tubes. It is designed to detect GRBs over a wide range of energies between 8 keV and 1 MeV. This work presents results obtained during ground calibration tests performed on all four GBM detectors prior to launch. We present data taken using radioactive sources as well as cosmic muons. These data were used to determine the response functions of the detectors which can then be used to reconstruct the incident photon fluxes."}
{"text":"We present new photometric observations in the visible range for five faint irregular satellites of Uranus (Sycorax, Prospero,  Stephano, Setebos; Trinculo) obtained with the 1-m telescope at the South African Astronomical Observatory during two observing runs on September 24-25th 2010 and March 28-29th 2011. The data were reduced using standard procedures within IRAF. We used aperture photometry to extract magnitudes of these objects relative to comparison stars observed simultaneously.  These results are presented together with previously published light-curves and colour indices. All our measurements are consistent with previous ones but we have significantly improved their accuracy by reducing systematic errors due to atmospheric conditions or instrumental effects. Our analysis shows that all five satellites exhibit very similar behaviour - they are redder than predicted by models of irradiated icy bodies and show no significant phase variations over several years. This suggests that they may be covered by dark material which is not exposed directly to solar radiation."}
{"text":"We present an analysis of the observed GRB redshifts and their distribution in terms of cosmological parameters, using two different statistical methods to account for selection effects: (i) Monte Carlo simulations; (ii) maximum likelihood fitting. We find that both approaches lead to consistent results within 1 sigma uncertainty range. The best-fit values are $\\Omega_m = 0.27 \\pm 0.04$ and $H_0 = 65 \\pm 5 km s^{-1}\\ Mpc^{-1}$ with no significant preference between flat or open universe models. These results are compatible with those obtained by other authors who used similar techniques but have not accounted properly for selection effects. Our method is robust against possible systematics due to uncertainties on the luminosity function at high redshifts. This work was supported by NASA grant NAG5-10842. Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), intense flashes of gamma rays lasting from milliseconds up to several minutes, were discovered more than twenty years ago [1] . They are now known to be associated with massive stars [2] , which explode as supernovae [3] .\nThe most important property of these explosions is their enormous energy output [4] : they release about 10 51 erg in less than one second [5] . Their distance scale can be determined through observations of absorption lines [6] or afterglow emission [7, 8] . In this way it has been shown that GRBs occur over a wide range of distances [9] , spanning six orders of magnitude in luminosity [10] . It follows that GRBs provide us with information on the star formation rate [11] and chemical enrichment history [12] out to very large redshifts [13] .\nIn recent years there has been considerable progress in understanding how GRBs form [14, 15] . However, despite all efforts made so far, many questions remain unanswered [16] . One of them concerns the nature of dark matter [17] ."}
{"text":"We present an analysis of the X-ray spectra of accreting pulsar systems using a model for Comptonization in hot plasma that includes relativistic effects, such as Doppler boosting and gravitational redshift.  We find that this model provides good fits to the observed pulse profiles and energy-dependent pulse fractions of several sources with luminosities ranging over four orders of magnitude (from 1033 erg s-1 to 1029 erg s-1). The inferred values of the electron temperature are consistent with those expected if these objects radiate at their Eddington limits. In addition, we show how our results can be used to estimate the mass of neutron stars in these systems by comparing the measured fluxes with theoretical predictions based on models of the emission mechanisms.

{"text":"We present an absolute calibration of MIPS photometry at 24, 70, and 160 microns using stellar calibrators observed by the Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) onboard the Spitzer Space Telescope. We use these observations to derive corrections that account for differences in aperture size between IRAC and MIPS as well as color-dependent effects due to differing filter profiles. These corrections are applied to all sources detected with signal-to-noise ratios greater than 5 in each band. For fainter sources we apply additional corrections based upon the measured fluxes of bright stars within the same field-of-view. This method is used to calibrate over 1 million objects across the sky. We find excellent agreement between our results and those obtained independently by other groups. Our final uncertainties include contributions from both statistical errors and systematics associated with the choice of stellar calibrators. We also provide estimates of the uncertainty introduced into the derived colors when applying this technique."}
{"text":"We present absolute calibration results on the MIPS 24, 70, and 160 m bands obtained with observations of Neptune in its southern winter hemisphere. We find that our photometric model is accurate to better than 5% over most of the field-of-view (FOV) at all three wavelengths. The uncertainty in the absolute flux scale is dominated by uncertainties in the Neptune models used as calibrators. These are estimated to be less than 10% across each bandpass. In addition we have characterized the detector response function using data taken during spacecraft testing prior to launch. This characterization has been incorporated into the final processing pipeline which will produce calibrated images for science use.

{"text":"The Boolean Network (BN) is an important class of models for the analysis and prediction of gene regulatory networks, which are used to describe how genes interact with each other in biological systems. In this study we use BNs as a tool to predict the order of events during the cell division process of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. We construct two different BNs using data obtained by microarray experiments performed on synchronized cultures at four time points along the cell cycle. The first BN was constructed based only on the expression levels of the core set of genes that were found to be essential for cell viability. The second BN was built including all genes whose expression profiles showed significant changes across the cell cycle. Using these BNs we predicted the order of events occurring during the cell cycle. Our results show that both BNs can accurately reproduce the observed temporal ordering of the cell cycle phases. However, when compared against one another, our results suggest that the inclusion of non-core genes into the BN may lead to more accurate predictions."}
{"text":"We report on non-adiabatic effects in dissociative oxygen adsorption and desorption processes occurring at low temperatures (<100 K). The experiments were performed using an ultrahigh vacuum scanning tunneling microscope equipped with a molecular beam source for dosing O 2 molecules onto clean, well-ordered Al(111) surfaces held at different sample temperatures between 10 and 100 K. We find that the sticking probability decreases strongly when increasing the surface temperature due to thermal activation of vibrational modes which lead to non-collinearity of electronic states involved in the reaction process. This effect is also observed during the subsequent desorption of atomic oxygen from the surface. In addition we observe a pronounced dependence of the sticking coefficient on the kinetic energy of incident oxygen molecules: At high energies (>500 meV), where the molecule-surface interaction time becomes comparable or even shorter than typical vibrational periods, the sticking probability increases again as compared to lower kinetic energies."}
{"text":"We present the first results on differential rotation for an evolved star, based on observations with the Microvariability and Oscillations of STars (MOST) satellite. The target is the F-type main-sequence star kappa 1 Cet (HD 128898), which has been observed in two consecutive runs during 2005-2006. We find that the surface shear rate decreases towards lower latitudes, but increases again at mid-latitudes. This behaviour can be explained if we assume that there are two differentially rotating regions on opposite sides of the equator. In addition to this large-scale pattern, we also detect smaller-scale features such as spots and plages. These structures appear to have lifetimes between one week and several months. Finally, we show how our results compare with theoretical predictions made using stellar evolution models. Keywords: Differential rotation; Stellar activity; Spots; Plages; MOST"}
{"text":"We present an overview of our recent work on vector meson production in heavy ion collisions at RHIC and LHC energies, based on holographic QCD models with chiral symmetry breaking (AdS\/QCD). We discuss how these models can be used to calculate hadronic observables such as transverse momentum spectra and elliptic flow coefficients for light quarks and gluons produced in nuclear reactions. In particular we focus on the role played by the coupling between the bulk fields and the gauge field fluctuations dual to vector mesons. The results are compared with experimental data obtained at RHIC and LHC: they show good agreement both qualitatively and quantitatively. \n \n Keywords: Vector Mesons, Heavy Ion Collisions, Holography, Chiral Symmetry Breaking, Gauge\/Gravity Duality \n \n 1 Introduction \n \n One of the most exciting discoveries made recently at RHIC is that strongly interacting matter behaves like a nearly perfect fluid [1] . This observation has led many theorists to propose new ways of describing this state of matter using effective theories which incorporate hydrodynamics [2] , or even more exotic descriptions involving quark-gluon plasma droplets [3] .\n \nIn order to understand better what happens during the early stages of heavy-ion collisions it would be very useful if one could study experimentally the properties of the hot dense medium created in those collisions. However, due to its extremely short lifetime, this medium cannot be directly probed through standard scattering experiments. Instead, information about the initial conditions of the collision process must be inferred indirectly from final-state measurements [4] . For example, the collective expansion of the system leads to anisotropic particle emission patterns known as azimuthal asymmetries [5] . These anisotropies have been measured [6] and found to agree well with theoretical predictions [7, 8] . \n \n Another important observable characterizing the dynamics of the expanding fireball is the spectrum of emitted particles [9] . It was shown [10] that the shape of this spectrum depends sensitively on the equation-of-state of the medium [11] . Moreover, the observed suppression [12] of high-pT hadrons"}
{"text":"We present new measurements of rotational widths (W20) and surface brightnesses (SB) for a sample of galaxies with inclinations between 30\u00b0and 80\u00b0, drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7. We find that W20 is correlated strongly with SB at fixed luminosity, but only weakly or not at all with galaxy mass. This correlation persists even when we restrict our analysis to late-type spirals, which are known to have flat rotation curves. These results suggest that the observed scatter in the Tully-Fischer relation may be due primarily to variations in SB among galaxies of similar luminosities rather than differences in their masses. In addition, we show that this effect can explain why previous studies found no significant dependence on inclination angle in the TF relation. Finally, we demonstrate how these correlations affect estimates of the Hubble constant derived using the TF relation. Our findings also provide an explanation for the apparent discrepancy between the values obtained by different authors who used samples selected over different ranges of inclination angles."}
{"text":"We study string theory in anti-de Sitter space-time (AdS) with two dimensions, which is dual to noncritical M-theory at high energies. We show that this duality can be understood as an equivalence between certain two-dimensional conformal field theories (CFTs). The CFT corresponding to strings on AdS_2 has central charge c = 3l\/2G, where l is the radius of curvature of AdS_2 and G is Newton's constant. This CFT contains a free boson X_0 and a fermion $\\psi$; we find that the partition function $Z(\\beta)$ for these fields satisfies the following functional equation: \n$$Z(\\beta) = Z(1\/\\beta) \\exp\\left[-\\frac{\\beta^2}{2}\\ln\\left(1-e^{-2\\pi i\/3}\\right)\\right].$$ Here $1\/\\beta$ plays the role of the coupling constant $\\lambda$ in the worldsheet action.

{"text":"The Standard Model (SM) is the most successful theory in particle physics, but it has some problems such as hierarchy problem and naturalness problem. In this article we will discuss spontaneous symmetry breaking which can solve these problems. We will also introduce Higgs mechanism to explain how particles get their masses. Finally, we will talk about electroweak precision tests that are used to test SM predictions at high energy experiments. The Standard Model (SM) describes all known elementary particles and interactions between them very well up to now. However there are still some open questions like why do quarks have different masses? Why does the weak interaction become strong when energies increase? These questions lead us to consider new physics beyond the Standard Model. \n \n Spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs if a system with many symmetries becomes unstable against small perturbations. This means that even though the original Lagrangian describing the system looks symmetric under certain transformations, the ground state of the system breaks those symmetries spontaneously. For example, in quantum electrodynamics (QED), photons interact with electrons through the exchange of virtual electron-positron pairs. If you look closely into QED, you find out that the photon-electron vertex violates parity because the electric charge of an electron is negative while its spin is positive. But since the vacuum expectation value of the field operator for the electron vanishes, the ground state of QED preserves parity."}
{"text":"We study the bubbling solutions to type-IIB supergravity on anti-de Sitter space, which are dual to supersymmetric gauge theories with eight supercharges.

The latter description arises when the number of colors Nc of the gauge theory becomes large compared to the rank k of the gauge group. In this limit we find that the shell radii scale like Rshell\u223cNc\u22121\/2k , while the size of the core scales like rcore\u223cNk\u22121\/4 . This scaling behavior agrees precisely with expectations based on the analysis of the corresponding gauge-theory operators using the AdS\/CFT correspondence."}

Moreover we prove that this SDP is equivalent to another one which computes the so-called geometric measure of entanglement. Finally, we present several examples where our results are applied. Quantum information theory has been developed as a branch of physics since Bell's theorem [1] . In particular, many efforts have been made towards understanding how much information can be stored or transmitted using quantum resources [2] .\nOne important concept in quantum information theory is entanglement [3] , i.e., nonclassical correlation between two subsystems of a composite system [4] . Entangled states play crucial roles in various applications such as quantum teleportation [5] , superdense coding [6] , quantum key distribution [7] , and quantum metrology [8] . The amount of entanglement contained in a given state is usually quantified by means of entanglement measures [9] . These quantities provide useful tools for studying properties of quantum states [10] and their relations with other physical phenomena [11] .\nIn recent years there has been growing interest in extending these concepts beyond pure-state scenarios [12] . For instance, the notion of entanglement distillation [13] was extended to mixed states [14] . This led to the introduction of new measures of entanglement [15] - [17] . However, most of them cannot be evaluated analytically except for some special classes of states [18] - [20] . Therefore numerical methods [21] - [23] were proposed to compute them [24] - [26] . Among those approaches, semidefinite programming (SDP) [27] plays a central role [28] - [30] . It allows us to find solutions to optimization problems involving linear objective functions subject to linear constraints and quadratic equality\/inequality constraints [31] .

The LBGs show a clear overdensity toward the quasar position while LAEs do not have such a concentration. This result suggests that the physical conditions for star formation may be different between these two populations. \n \n Keywords: galaxy evolution, quasars, clustering, infrared observations, high-z universe, Lyman break galaxies, Lyman alpha emitters \n \n \n \n 1 Introduction \n \n Quasars play important roles as probes to study the early Universe because they can provide us information about the intergalactic medium through absorption lines observed in their spectra.

For example, it has been suggested that quasars trigger starburst activities in nearby galaxies via intense ultraviolet (UV) radiation and\/or gravitational interactions (e.g., Hopkins et al. 2006) . \n \n Recently, several studies have investigated the environments of high-redshift quasars based on multi-wavelength surveys.

We find that the jet can be accelerated by the pressure gradient force due to the density enhancement at the base of the jet. In addition, we show that the magnetic field plays an important role in accelerating the jet up to velocities comparable to those inferred observationally.

{"text":"We consider the hydrodynamics limit of a particle system in which particles can be created and destroyed at certain rates, depending on their position. The main result is that if these rates are sufficiently small then we obtain an entropy inequality similar to the one obtained by Otto and Villani (2000) for systems without creation or annihilation terms. This allows us to prove convergence towards equilibrium using standard techniques. \nIntroduction\n\nThe study of kinetic equations has been very active over recent years due to its applications in many areas such as plasma physics, astrophysics, population dynamics, etc. (see e.g., [Ott01] , [Vil02] ). In this context it is often useful to understand how solutions behave when they approach equilibrium. One way to do so is through the so-called \"hydrodynamic limit\" where one considers the evolution of macroscopic quantities like density, velocity and temperature. It turns out that under suitable assumptions there exists a limiting process called the fluid dynamic equation whose solution describes the behavior of the microscopic model near equilibrium. \n \n For example, let us consider the following simple model: \n \n \n \n Here f(t,x,v) denotes the distribution function of particles at time t, location x and speed v. We assume that the initial data f0 satisfies some regularity conditions.

{"text":"We present evidence that the strong equivalence principle (SEP) holds in general relativity at least up to second post Newtonian order, by showing that the SEP is satisfied if it holds at first PN order.  We show this by directly integrating the relaxed Einstein field equations with an appropriate source term which incorporates the effects of gravitational waves generated by accelerating bodies. The results are consistent with those obtained previously using perturbation theory. This work was supported by NSF grant PHY-0456747. In this article we will consider only isolated systems where no external forces act on any body. For such systems the total energy E = T + U , where T is the kinetic energy and U is the potential energy associated with all interactions between particles within the system. If there were no gravitational fields then the total energy would be conserved since the net force acting on each particle vanishes. However when gravitational fields exist they can exchange energy with matter through emission or absorption of gravitational waves."}

{"text":"We present the results of an analysis of all available data on cometary dust tails, including those observed by spacecraft and ground-based telescopes in recent years. We find that most of these objects are associated with Jupiter family comets (JFCs), which have orbital periods less than 20 yr. The JFCs produce dust tails that can be traced for up to several thousand AU along their orbits. These tails appear as narrow streams of material extending outward at high speed from the parent bodies. In some cases they show evidence of being disrupted into multiple fragments or branches. Most of the tail structures we observe are consistent with models where particles are released continuously over time scales ranging from months to thousands of years. However, there is growing observational evidence suggesting that many of these tails may also contain significant amounts of freshly produced dust grains ejected during more recent outburst events. This suggests that the production rate of dust particles in these systems varies significantly both spatially and temporally. \n \n Keywords: Comet"}
{"text":"We report on precise timing observations of the young ($\\sim$ 10,000 years) and energetic pulsar PSR J1210-5226 in the supernova remnant PKS 1209-51\/52 with XMM-Newton over an observation period of more than three years. The pulsed fraction is found to be constant within errors throughout this time span. We find that the spin-down rate has changed by about 10% between 2005 and 2008. This change can be explained as due to glitches or changes in the braking index. In addition we detect significant pulse profile variations which are likely caused by precession of the neutron star's magnetic axis. From our analysis we conclude that the pulsar was born weakly magnetized but its surface field strength increased significantly during its early life. Our results provide new insights into the physics of neutron stars. High energy emission from rotation-powered pulsars is powered by their rotational kinetic energy loss. As they slow down through electromagnetic dipole radiation, their luminosity decreases according to L = \\tau Erot, where $\\tau$ denotes the characteristic age of the pulsar. However, there exist several examples for which the observed luminosities exceed those expected from simple spin-down models. These so-called \"spin-down anomalies\" have been interpreted either as being due to additional sources of angular momentum losses such as gravitational wave emission or accretion onto the neutron star surface, or as being related to internal processes like superfluid vortex creep or crustal deformations induced by rapid cooling after birth."}
{"text":"We consider the wiretap channel model in which an eavesdropper can obtain feedback about its observations and use it to improve future decoding attempts. We show that, for any positive integer , there exists a sequence of (2, ) codes such that each code has rate at least . This result is obtained by combining polar coding techniques with ideas from successive cancellation list decoding. The proof relies on a new converse bound for the secrecy capacity region of the wiretap channel with feedback. Finally, we present numerical results illustrating our achievability scheme. In this work, we study the wiretap channel model introduced by Wyner [1] . In particular, we focus on the case where the legitimate receiver obtains feedback about his past observations and uses it to improve his future decoding attempts. Our main contribution consists in showing that polar codes [2] combined with successive cancellation list decoding [3] achieve rates close to the secrecy capacity when used over channels with feedback. More specifically, we prove that if the number of messages grows exponentially fast as a function of the blocklength then every message can be transmitted reliably using a code whose length scales linearly with the number of messages .\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

{"text":"Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) are promising candidates for future nanoelectronic devices due to their unique electronic properties and high carrier mobility at room temperature. However, the scaling behaviors of GNRFETs have not been fully understood yet because of the difficulty in simulating realistic device structures with atomistic details using conventional approaches such as density functional theory or tight-binding method. In this work, we perform large-scale quantum transport simulations on GNR-FETs by solving the nonequilibrium Green's function equations within an effective mass approximation. We find that the subthreshold swing decreases rapidly when the channel length is reduced below 10 nm while it increases slowly beyond 20 nm. The ON\/OFF current ratio also shows similar trends but its value becomes saturated around 100 nm. These results suggest that the optimal channel length should be between 10-20 nm depending on the required performance parameters. Our findings can provide useful guidelines for designing practical graphene-based transistors."}

We find that the effect is enhanced for higher-order Bragg diffraction orders due to their larger momentum transfer per photon. Our results demonstrate how nonlinear interactions can be used as a tool to enhance quantum mechanical phenomena such as tunneling or wavefunction collapse. \nPACS numbers: 03.75.Dg, 37.10.Jk, 42.50.Vj Matter waves have been studied extensively over many decades [1] . In particular, they provide a unique opportunity to study fundamental quantum mechanics [2] , e. g., through the investigation of macroscopic superpositions [3] , squeezed states [4] , or entanglement [5] .\nIn this work we present experimental evidence for nonlinearity-enhanced tunneling in a matterwave interferometer [6] . This phenomenon occurs when atoms undergo multiple scattering events during propagation inside the interferometer [7, 8] . It has previously been predicted theoretically [9] but never observed experimentally so far [10] . Here we show that it can be observed using current state-of-the-art technology [11] . \nThe experiment was performed with 87 Rb atoms trapped in a one-dimensional (1D) optical lattice [12] . A schematic illustration of the setup is shown in Fig.  1(a) . Two counter-propagating laser beams form a standing wave pattern with wavelength \u03bb = 532 nm and periodicity d = \u03bb\/2 = 266 nm. An additional weak probe beam at 780 nm propagates perpendicularly to the lattice beams and couples adjacent sites via stimulated Raman transitions [13] . By adjusting its intensity I p , the effective hopping rate J between neighboring sites can be controlled [14] . For small values of |I p \/I sat | \u226a 1, where I sat denotes the saturation intensity, the system behaves like a Bose-Hubbard chain [15]"}
{"text":"We study the dynamics of particles suspended in an idealized, two-dimensional turbulent jet using direct numerical simulations (DNS). The jet is forced by imposing random velocity fluctuations at its inflow boundary; it develops into a coherent vortex street downstream that breaks down further downstream to form small-scale turbulence. We find that the particle trajectories are strongly influenced by the presence of large-scale vortices which trap them for extended periods of time. In addition, we observe that the particles can be trapped within smaller scale eddies as well. These dynamical traps lead to enhanced concentration levels of particles along certain regions of their trajectory. Finally, we show that the trapping effect depends on the initial position of the particles with respect to the mean flow direction. Our results suggest that this mechanism may play an important role in the transport of pollutants or other tracers in geophysical flows such as atmospheric jets. Turbulence plays an important role in many natural phenomena ranging from weather prediction to oceanic mixing processes [1] . It also has significant impact on industrial applications including combustion [2] , chemical engineering [3] , and fluid mechanics [4] .\nIn recent years there have been several studies aimed at understanding how particles behave when they are suspended in a turbulent flow [5] - [8] . This problem is relevant not only because of practical reasons but also due to fundamental interest in studying the statistical properties of Lagrangian trajectories [9] . For example, one would like to know whether particles tend to cluster together [10] or disperse homogeneously [11] depending upon their size [12] and\/or shape [13] ."}
{"text":"We study the generation of entangled photon pairs via spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) inside an optical cavity with two mirrors, one partially transmitting at resonance. We show that temporal effects play a crucial role for the amount of generated entanglement when the pump field is not monochromatic or has a finite bandwidth. In particular we find that the maximum degree of entanglement decreases as the width of the pump spectrum increases. Moreover, we demonstrate how to optimize this process by choosing appropriate values for the mirror transmission coefficients. Finally, we discuss the effect of losses on the entanglement properties of the emitted state. Entanglement plays a key role in quantum information processing [1] . It can be used to perform tasks such as teleportation [2] , superdense coding [3] , Bell-state measurements [4] , and quantum cryptography [5] .\nEntanglement between photons can be created using different physical systems [6] - [8] . Among these, nonlinear crystals are widely employed because they allow efficient conversion into entangled states [9] . The most common way to generate entangled photons is through spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC), which occurs in second-order nonlinear media [10] . SPDC generates pairs of correlated photons whose frequencies sum up to twice the frequency of the pump beam [11] . This process takes place within a small volume around the crystal where the intensity of the pump light is high enough [12] . If the pump beam is sufficiently intense, it may lead to significant pair production even if its spatial profile does not match exactly the mode function of the nonlinear medium [13] . However, the use of pulsed lasers leads to additional complications due to their non-Gaussian statistics [14] ."}
{"text":"We describe an infrared cloud monitor that has been developed to detect clouds in the atmosphere above the Magellan Observatory on Mt. Haleakala, Hawaii. The system uses two near-infrared cameras and is designed to operate continuously during nighttime hours when astronomical observations are made with the telescope. It provides information about the sky conditions over the entire field-of-view (FOV) of the telescope's primary mirror. This information can be used by observers to select targets or to modify their observing strategies accordingly. We present results obtained using this instrumentation since its installation in August 2005. These data show that the atmospheric transparency varies significantly across the FOV of the telescope. For example, we find that the median value of the total integrated water vapor column density measured within one hour of each observation was 0.5 mm H2O for the northern part of the FOV but 1.1 mm H2O for the southern portion. We also demonstrate how these measurements have helped us optimize our observational strategy."}
{"text":"We present an analysis of the connection between different galaxy types using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We use two methods to classify galaxies into four types: star-forming galaxies (SFG), active galactic nuclei host galaxies (AGNHG), early-type galaxies with emission lines (ETGEL) and early-type galaxies without emission lines (ETGSIL).\nThe first method is based on the principal component analysis (PCA) applied to the optical spectra of all galaxies classified as spectroscopic targets by the SDSS pipeline. The second one uses the PCA applied only to the subset of galaxies that are morphologically selected for having bulges dominated by old stellar populations. In both cases we find that ETGs form a continuous sequence in terms of their spectral properties along which SFGs evolve towards ETGSILs through ETGELs. This evolutionary path can be described by a simple linear combination of three eigenvectors corresponding to the most prominent features seen in the mean spectrum of each type of galaxies."}
{"text":"We propose that cosmological symmetry breaking is driven by pseudo-scale invariant (PSI) scalar fields which are responsible for dark energy in our universe.  We show how this mechanism can be implemented within the standard model framework with minimal extensions to its particle content. The proposed scenario provides an explanation for why the vacuum expectation value of the Higgs field has not yet been observed experimentally at LHC energies. It also predicts new particles beyond those already discovered at LHC experiments. In addition we discuss possible connections between the present proposal and other recent ideas on cosmic acceleration such as quintessence models and modified gravity theories. Introduction:-The discovery of accelerated expansion of the universe [1-3] has led to renewed interest in understanding the nature of dark energy [4] . This phenomenon may have profound consequences for fundamental physics [5] , including quantum gravity [6] .\nIn this letter we consider whether there exists any connection between dark energy and the electroweak scale [7-10]. Our main motivation comes from the fact that the current experimental data cannot rule out the possibility that the Higgs boson mass M H lies close to the Planck scale [11] . If so then it would imply that the Higgs potential V(H) could become unstable against radiative corrections [12] . As a result one expects that the effective potential V eff = V + \u2206V will develop a minimum away from zero where V denotes the tree-level potential while \u2206V represents all loop contributions [13] . However if the Higgs boson were to acquire a large vacuum expectation value v \u226b 246 GeV then it would lead to spontaneous breakdown of gauge symmetries [14] . On the other hand if the Higgs boson acquires a small vev < 246GeV then it implies that the electroweak scale is stabilized by some unknown dynamics [15] ."}
{"text":"The concept of molecular computation is based on the idea that information can be stored and processed in chemical systems, such as biopolymers or cells. In this work we propose to use living cells as computational units. We show how it is possible to encode an algorithm into the DNA sequence of a cell population so that its execution leads to the production of a desired output molecule. The proposed approach has several advantages over existing methods. First, it allows us to perform computations with very large input data sets (the entire genome). Second, it does not require any external control signals during the computation process. Third, it provides a natural way to store intermediate results within the cell's memory. Finally, it enables parallel processing by using multiple copies of the same program simultaneously. This article presents our first experimental results obtained by implementing a simple sorting algorithm. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method works well even when only one copy of the program is used."}
{"text":"We present an analysis of the spatial correlation between galaxy clusters and active galactic nuclei (AGNs) detected by the ROSAT North Ecliptic Pole Survey (NEP). We use a sample of AGNs selected with the hardness ratio method, which is insensitive to obscuration effects due to dusty torii around AGNs. The clustering signal for this sample shows no significant difference compared to that obtained using optically-selected samples at similar redshifts. This suggests that there are not many heavily obscured AGNs among our sample. Using the best-fit model parameters derived from the auto-correlations of both galaxy clusters and AGNs, we find that the amplitude of the cross-correlation function agrees well with theoretical predictions based on linear biasing models. However, the observed shape of the cross-correlation functions differs significantly from those predicted by these simple models. In particular, the observed cross-correlation function has a steeper slope than expected near zero separation distance."}

In particular we obtain new proofs of some results due to Wright on the number of graphs with n vertices having certain properties (such as being bipartite) which are related to the coefficients appearing in the expansion of the exponential generating function of these numbers into powers of t.

{"text":"Dark energy, the mysterious force that drives the accelerated expansion of the universe, has been one of the most controversial topics in modern cosmology.  In this article we argue that fundamentalists have misunderstood and distorted the concept of dark energy to serve their own political agenda.

The purpose of our work is not only to explain what dark energy really is but also to provide evidence against those who claim that there is no scientific basis behind its existence.

{"text":"We present new results on X-ray source counts based on data obtained with Chandra and XMM-Newton over an area of 1 deg2 within the Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS). We use two different approaches to estimate the number density of sources as a function of flux, one using photometric redshifts for all detected sources and another where we assume that each source is at z = 0.5. The latter approach allows us to compare our results directly with previous work which has used this assumption. Our best-fit model parameters are consistent between these two methods but there are significant differences when compared to other recent studies. These discrepancies may be due to cosmic variance or systematic effects associated with the analysis techniques employed by those authors. In addition, we find evidence for evolution in the luminosity functions derived from both datasets out to redshift z ~ 3. This evolution can be described by a simple power law with index \u03b1 = -1.6 \u00b1 0.3."}
{"text":"We have studied how changes in the abundance pattern affect the frequencies and amplitudes of low-degree p-mode oscillations using two different methods, namely forward modelling (with the help of MESA stellar evolution code) and inverse analysis with the help of GYRE pulsation code. We find that for both methods there is an increase in the frequency difference between observed and theoretical values when we decrease the metallicity by 0.1 dex or more. The effect on amplitude differences are less pronounced but still significant. This shows that it will be very difficult to determine accurate absolute metallicities of stars based only on asteroseismic data.  For example, if one were to use the results obtained here as priors in the Bayesian framework then this would lead to underestimated uncertainties in the derived parameters such as age and mass. However, our study also suggests that relative metallicities can be determined quite accurately even without any additional information about other physical properties of the star."}
{"text":"In this work, we propose an approach to human identification based on the analysis of image attributes and their relationships with each other. We use a set of visual features that are extracted by applying state-of-the-art computer vision techniques over images in order to represent them as vectors of numerical values. These feature vectors can be used to train machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs) or Random Forests (RF). In addition, we also consider the relationship between these features using Graphical Models (GM), which allow us to learn how they interact with one another. The proposed method is evaluated against two different datasets containing face images captured under controlled conditions. Our results show that our system outperforms existing approaches when identifying individuals across multiple sessions. This research was supported by the National Science Foundation through awards IIS-1253153 and CNS-1527225. In this work, we propose a novel approach to identify humans based on the analysis of their facial appearance. To do so, we extract several visual features from faces using state-of-the-art computer vision methods. Then, we model the interactions among those features using graphical models. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our method against two publicly available databases."}

We find evidence for both neutral atomic hydrogen and molecular hydrogen in these objects based on detection of their ro-vibrational transitions near 2 microns. \n \n These observations provide important constraints on models of disk structure and evolution as well as physical conditions within protoplanetary disks.

{"text":"We study the correlations and sum rules in a semi-infinite system with impurities at its surface, which is described by the quantum two-dimensional (2D) one component plasma model. We use the exact diagonalization method to calculate the density-density correlation function and static structure factor as well as their corresponding sum rules. The results show that there are two different regimes depending on whether the temperature T is larger or smaller than the Fermi energy EF . In particular, we find that when T < EF , the behavior of these quantities can be understood within the framework of Landau's Fermi liquid theory. However, if T > EF , our numerical data deviate significantly from this picture. Finally, we also investigate how the presence of impurities affects the above mentioned physical properties. Our findings suggest that the effect of impurities depends strongly on the distance between them. If they are close enough, then the impurity-impurity interaction dominates over other interactions leading to an increase of the effective mass of particles near the surface."}
{"text":"We present an algorithm to construct the reduced basis space in the context of nonlinear problems with multiple solutions, which is based on the concept of quasi-equilibrium grid (QEG). The QEG method was originally developed by Simo and Armero as a numerical technique for solving rate-independent processes such as plasticity or damage mechanics. We show that this approach can be used to generate snapshots for constructing the reduced basis spaces associated with nonlinear problems with multiple solutions. In particular, we consider two examples arising from structural dynamics and fluid flow computations. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed method yields accurate approximations at significantly lower computational cost than existing approaches. Keywords: Reduced Basis Method; Quasi-Equilibrium Grids; Nonlinear Problems; Model Order Reduction; Geometric Construction; Snapshot Generation. 1 Introduction.\nThe goal of this work is to develop efficient algorithms for generating snapshots for constructing the RB spaces associated with nonlinear problems having multiple solutions. This problem arises frequently when one solves engineering applications involving complex physical phenomena such as multiphysics coupling, material failure, contact\/impact, etc.. For example, in structural dynamics, it may happen that different initial conditions lead to different equilibrium states [19, 20] . Similarly, in fluid flows, there are often many steady-state solutions corresponding to different boundary conditions [7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18] .\nIn order to solve these types of problems efficiently using the reduced basis method (RBM), it is necessary to have a good set of snapshots representing all possible solution behaviors. However, since each snapshot corresponds to a specific solution behavior, it is not easy to obtain them directly through standard finite element analysis. Therefore, various techniques have been developed over the past decade to overcome this difficulty [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40"}

The direct gap at \u0393 point is found to be 1.8 eV which agrees well with experimental value. The imaginary part of dielectric function shows two peaks around 2.5 eV and 4.0 eV corresponding to transitions between O-2p and I-5s orbitals respectively.

{"text":"We present new results on the survival timescale for micron- to centimeter-sized dust grains in protoplanetary disk environments, based on laboratory experiments and numerical simulations. We find that millimeter-to centimeter-sized particles can survive for at least 10 Myr under typical conditions found in protoplanetary systems (e.g., gas density nH = 104 cm-3). The lifetime is longer than previously thought because we take into account the effect of coagulation between small grains and large grains as well as fragmentation by collisions with other large grains. Our results suggest that the mm-cm sized grain population may be responsible for producing some of the features seen in infrared observations of debris disks around main-sequence stars. In addition, our results imply that these large grains are likely to contribute significantly to the mass budget of planetesimals formed through gravitational instability or collisional growth processes. \n \n Keywords: Dust evolution, Disk structure"}
{"text":"We study the generic properties of discrete choice models with social influence, where agents make decisions based on their own private information and the choices made by others in their neighborhood.  We show that if there is no correlation between individuals' private signals then any equilibrium must be symmetric across individuals (i.e., all equilibria are identical up to relabeling). If instead there exists some positive correlation among individuals' private signals, we prove that there always exist asymmetric equilibria. Finally, for intermediate levels of correlation, we provide examples showing both types of equilibria can co-exist. These results hold regardless of whether or not agents have common knowledge about each other's payoffs. \nOur analysis relies heavily on recent advances in the theory of global games. The main idea behind our approach is to view an agent's decision problem as a two-stage game played against nature. At stage one, Nature chooses her signal realization; at stage two, she makes her choice conditional on this realized signal."}

We measure equivalent widths of several lines of S i and derive atmospheric parameters by fitting synthetic spectra to these features. Our results are compared against those derived from photometry and low resolution spectroscopy. We find that our values agree well within uncertainties but tend to be higher than previous estimates. This is likely due to systematic differences between different methods used to determine stellar parameters. In addition, we compare our results to theoretical predictions based on evolutionary models and find good agreement when considering only stars older than 1 Gyr. However, there appears to be significant scatter among younger objects. Finally, we investigate possible correlations between [Fe\/H] , T eff and [S\/H] ."}
{"text":"We have measured the Li abundance for 16 turn-off (TO) stars in the metal-rich open cluster 47 Tucanae, using high-resolution spectra obtained with UVES at VLT-UT2 telescope.

We find that all but one star show an overabundance of Li compared to the Sun by factors ranging from 2 up to 6 times its solar value. This is consistent with previous studies which found similar results for other clusters such as M71 or NGC6397. However, we also find evidence for significant star-to-star scatter in the Li content among these TO stars.

{"text":"The solar cycle is an important phenomenon in space weather, which can have significant effects on Earth and its technological infrastructure.

We find that our model predicts the amplitude of the current cycle well but underestimates the length by about one year. Our results suggest that the Sun will enter into minimum phase around 2013-14 followed by maximum phase around 2017-18. This prediction agrees reasonably well with other recent predictions made by different groups.

{"text":"We propose to use the time evolution of cosmological redshifts in order to probe the nature of dark energy, which is one of the most important problems in modern physics and astronomy. We show that this method can be used for testing various models of dark energy by using only two parameters (the present-day values of Hubble constant H0 and deceleration parameter q0). The proposed method does not require any additional information about the universe beyond what we already know today. This makes it possible to perform an independent check on the results obtained with other methods such as supernovae Ia observations or cosmic microwave background anisotropy measurements. In particular, our analysis shows that the current data are consistent with the standard \u039bCDM model at 1\u03c3 level but do not rule out some alternative models like quintessence or phantom fields. Finally, we discuss how future surveys could improve the constraints on these models. Cosmological redshifts play an important role in modern astrophysics and cosmology because they provide us with valuable information about the expansion history of the Universe. However, their interpretation requires knowledge of the underlying theory describing the dynamics of space-time. For example, if we assume general relativity then cosmological redshifts can be interpreted as due to the Doppler effect caused by the recession velocities of distant galaxies [1] . On the other hand, if we consider modified gravity theories then cosmological redshifting may have different physical origins [2] .\nIn recent years there has been growing interest in studying the possibility of probing the nature of dark energy through its effects on cosmological redshifts [3] - [8] .

We show that if there is no limit on the number of nodes, then any network topology can be achieved by adjusting the transmission range accordingly. However, when we have resource constraints at individual nodes, it becomes impossible to achieve all possible topologies. In this case, we propose an algorithm which achieves almost all possible topologies while minimizing the total energy consumption. Our results are based on the analysis of the relationship between the degree distribution and the average path length for random geometric graphs. The proposed algorithm also takes into account the heterogeneity among different nodes. Finally, simulation experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

This new paradigm opens up many opportunities for wireless communications [2] , such as dynamic spectrum sharing [3] , cooperative communication [4] , etc.. One important issue in cognitive radios is how to design efficient protocols so that secondary users can share the available spectrum fairly [5] .\nIn order to improve the performance of cognitive radios, one promising solution is to deploy multiple antennas [6] - [8] or relay stations [9] - [11] . Another way is to use multi-hop transmissions [12] - [14] . These approaches require cooperation among neighboring nodes [15] - [17] . Therefore, the underlying network structure plays an important role in determining the overall system performance [18] - [20] . For example, in [21] , authors studied the effect of spatial reuse on the throughput capacity of ad hoc networks. They showed that the maximum achievable throughput scales linearly with the minimum hop count between two randomly chosen nodes. On the other hand, [22] proved that the per-node throughput decreases exponentially with the increase of the density of interfering nodes. Thus, understanding the fundamental properties of cognitive networks will help us develop more efficient algorithms [23] - [25] ."}
{"text":"We study the density of states (DOS) and the Josephson current through an SNS junction with nonideal interfaces, where spin flip scattering is present at both normal metal\/superconductor contacts. We show that for small values of the interface resistance Rint, the DOS exhibits peaks near zero energy which are due to Andreev bound states localized on the N\/S interfaces. The height of these peaks decreases as Rint increases but they remain visible even when Rint = h\/4e^2. For large values of Rint we find that the DOS becomes smooth and no longer shows any structure around E=0. In this regime, the Josephson current can be calculated using the Usadel equation without taking into account proximity effects. This result agrees well with previous calculations based on the quasiclassical theory. \n \n We also calculate the critical current Ic(T), showing how it depends on temperature T and the ratio between the length L of the normal region and the coherence length \u03be0.

{"text":"We present an extension of the yield design theory in order to take into account the effect of fluid flows on the mechanical behavior of porous materials. The proposed approach is based on the use of an approximate solution of the Navier-Stokes equations and leads to a new kinematic criterion which takes into account both the effects of inertia and viscosity. This criterion can be used as a basis for numerical simulations or analytical developments. We illustrate this approach by considering two examples of application: (i) the stability analysis of a rigid body immersed in a viscous incompressible fluid; (ii) the study of the failure mode of a granular material submitted to a steady-state flow. Keywords: Yield design, Flow, Inertia, Viscosity, Porous medium, Failure mode. 1 Introduction Yield design theory has been developed since the 1950s [1] . It consists in determining the critical state at which a structure fails under static loading conditions. Since then, many extensions have been made to include dynamic loads [2] , plastic strains [3] , anisotropy [4] , damage [5] ... However, these theories are not adapted to deal with fluids flowing inside structures [6] .\nIn recent years, several authors [7, 8] have tried to extend the yield design theory to take into account the influence of fluid flows on the structural response. These works were mainly motivated by applications related to geotechnical engineering [9] where it is necessary to predict the collapse of soil masses due to water infiltration [10] . For example, [11] studied the case of a dam built over a reservoir filled with water. They showed that the presence of water could lead to significant changes in the failure mechanism compared to the dry case [12] . Other studies [13, 14] focused on the prediction of the failure modes of slopes covered with snow during avalanches [15] . Finally, [16] investigated the problem of the stability of a floating platform in contact with a turbulent current [17] ."}
{"text":"In this thesis, we study power control problems in cellular mobile radio systems with code division multiple access (CDMA). We consider the uplink scenario where each user transmits to its base station using an orthogonal spreading sequence and all users share the same frequency band. The objective is to minimize the total transmit power subject to individual quality-of-service constraints at each user's receiver. In order to obtain tractable results, we make use of tools from stochastic geometry which allow us to model the locations of both mobiles and interferers as point processes. Our main contributions are summarized below.  First, we derive closed-form expressions for the outage probability when the number of active users grows without bound. These expressions can be used to determine how many users can simultaneously communicate reliably over the network. Second, we propose distributed power control schemes that achieve these limits asymptotically under certain conditions. Third, we develop centralized power control algorithms that guarantee performance close to optimality even if only partial information about the channel gains or interference levels is available. Finally, we present simulation results illustrating our theoretical findings."}
{"text":"We present an accurate and efficient fundamental-measure density-functional (FMT) approach to describe fluids composed of rigidly-aligned hard hexagons, which are relevant as model systems for liquid crystals or colloidal suspensions with anisotropic interactions. The FMT is based on a decomposition into three different types of weighted densities that can be evaluated efficiently using fast Fourier transforms. We show how this new FMT yields excellent results compared to Monte Carlo simulations over wide ranges of packing fractions and orientations of the particles. In particular we find very good agreement between our theoretical predictions and simulation data at high packing fractions where previous approaches fail due to strong correlations among neighboring particles. Finally, we demonstrate that our method also allows us to accurately predict structural properties such as pair correlation functions and orientational order parameters. This work provides further evidence that FMTs provide a powerful tool to study complex fluids beyond simple spherical particle models. \nI. INTRODUCTORY REMARkS\nThe description of liquids and soft matter requires sophisticated methods because these materials often exhibit complex structures and dynamics. Density functionals have been developed during recent years as promising tools to tackle many-body problems in statistical mechanics [1] . They allow one to calculate equilibrium properties of interacting particles by minimizing a free energy functional with respect to the local number density distribution. A particularly successful class of density functionals are so-called fundamental-measure density-functionals (FMD), which were originally introduced by Rosenfeld [2] .\nIn their original form they only apply to fluids consisting of identical spheres but extensions to more complicated shapes like ellipsoids [3] , rods [4] , dumbbells [5] , spherocylinders [6] , and even patchy particles [7, 8] have been proposed recently. However, most of these works focus on the case of uniaxial symmetry while there exist few studies dealing with more general situations [9] . Here we consider a system of rigidly-aligned"}
{"text":"In this work, we consider the problem of power control and receiver design to maximize the sum rate over multiple access (MAC) channels using code division multiple access (CDMA). We assume that each user transmits its signal through an independent fading channel which is subject to both path loss and shadowing effects. The received signals are corrupted by additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), inter-user interference due to imperfect orthogonality among users' spreading codes, and intra-cell interference caused by other active users within the same cell. In addition, all users employ bandlimited waveforms such as pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM) or quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM).\nWe first derive closed-form expressions for the ergodic capacity region under different assumptions on the knowledge available at the transmitter side about the instantaneous channel state information (CSI). Then, based on these results, we propose two distributed algorithms to achieve the optimal operating point on the boundary of the ergodic capacity region. Finally, numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the performance improvement achieved by our proposed schemes compared to conventional ones."}

In order to reduce systematic errors due to finite volume effects we employ periodic boundary conditions in all directions."}
{"text":"We study the relationship between two measures of complexity for infinite sequences, namely bounded pushdown dimension and Lempel-Ziv (LZ) information density.  We show that these two notions are equivalent in the sense that they agree on all computable sequences but disagree on some noncomputable ones.   In particular we prove that if an infinite sequence has finite LZ information density then it also has finite bounded pushdown dimension; however there exist noncomputable sequences with finite LZ information density which have unbounded pushdown dimension.    The results presented here were obtained while the author was at the University of California Santa Cruz as part of his Ph.D thesis under the supervision of Prof. David Harizanov. This work is supported by NSF grant CCF-0635070. 1 Introduction Computational problems often involve input data whose size can be very large or even infinite. For example, consider the problem of finding the shortest path through a graph where each edge has a weight associated to it; this problem requires one to find the minimum cost among infinitely many paths. Another example comes from computational biology, where DNA sequences may contain billions of letters. It would not make much sense to store such huge amounts of data explicitly, so algorithms must operate directly on the input stream. A natural way to measure how complex an algorithm is when operating on streams is via its space requirements. However, since storing an entire stream takes up too much memory, researchers instead focus on measuring the amount of storage needed only during certain phases of computation. One popular approach is to use the notion of dimension introduced by Lutz [Lut91] . Dimension captures the idea that the algorithm needs to remember only a small portion of the input stream at any given time. More formally, let $(X_i)_{i\\in\\mathbb{N}}$ be a sequence over alphabet $\\Sigma$. Then the dimension of $X$ is defined as: $$d(X) = \\min_{|Q|<\\infty} |\\{i\\in \\mathbb{N} : X_i \\in Q\\}|.$$ Here $Q\\subseteq\\Sigma^*$ denotes a set of strings called queries. If"}
{"text":"We present new calculations for the radiative transfer in stellar winds, including the effects of line-blanketing and clumping on the wind structure. We find that neglecting the porosity of the wind leads to an overestimate of the mass loss rate by up to two orders of magnitude compared with our results. This is because the density contrast between the dense clumps and the interclump medium increases as one moves out into the wind, leading to more absorption at large distances than would be expected if the wind were smooth. The effect becomes stronger when the wind velocity decreases or the metallicity increases. \n \n Keywords: Stellar winds, Radiation hydrodynamics, Line-driven winds, Porosity, Clumping \n \n Hot stars lose mass through their stellar winds driven by radiation pressure on spectral lines (Castor et al., 1975; Abbott & Lucy, 1985) . In order to understand how these winds are structured it is necessary to solve the coupled equations of radiative transfer and fluid dynamics simultaneously. However, this problem has proved extremely difficult to solve numerically due to its multi-scale nature - both spatially and temporally - which requires very high resolution grids to resolve all relevant scales correctly. As such, most previous studies have used simplified treatments of either the radiative transfer or the fluid dynamics, but not both together. For example, some authors assume that the wind consists entirely of optically thin gas (e.g. Friend & Castor, 1983) while others use simple prescriptions for the radial dependence of the optical depth (e.g. Pauldrach et al., 1986) , or even ignore the effects of opacity altogether (e.g. Lamers & Cassinelli, 1999 ) . Other authors make simplifying assumptions about the flow itself, e.g. assuming spherical symmetry (e.g. Puls et al., 1996 ) , steady state (e.g. Owocki et al. , 1988 ) and\/or stationarity (e.g. Runacres & Owocki , 2002 ) . \n \n Here we present new calculations for the structure of line-driven winds"}
{"text":"We present the results of an investigation into the physical nature of polar broad absorption line quasars (BALQSOs). We find that BALQSOs are more likely to be radio-loud than non-BAL QSOs, and that they have higher luminosities at rest-frame ultraviolet wavelengths. The fraction of BALQSOs in our sample is consistent with previous studies; however we do not detect any significant difference between the fractions of BALQSOs found among radio-quiet and radio-loud quasars. In addition, we find no evidence for differences in the properties of BALs observed along different lines-of-sight within individual objects. Finally, we show that there exists a correlation between the strength of the CIV emission-line blueshift and the equivalent width of the associated BAL trough. These findings suggest that BALQSOs may represent a special subclass of radio-loud quasars which are characterized by high accretion rates onto supermassive black holes."}

We find that all three are multiperiodic with periods ranging between 80 s to 1 min. The light curves show no evidence for eclipses or ellipsoidal variations which would be expected if these objects were in short-period binary systems. Using our data we have determined accurate values for their atmospheric parameters T eff , log g and [Fe\/H] as well as their projected rotational velocities v sin i . These results confirm previous findings that there is a correlation between the surface gravity and the effective temperature of sdBs. In addition, we found that the rotation velocity increases towards lower temperatures. Finally, we examined the distribution of the observed period ratios among the known sdB pulsators."}
{"text":"The in vivo behavior of looped DNA-protein complexes is investigated by using multiscale modeling and simulation techniques. The results show that the looping process can be divided into three stages, namely initiation, elongation, and termination. During the initiation stage, the protein binds to its recognition site on one end of the double helix; during the elongation stage, it slides along the double helix until reaching another recognition site at which point the complex terminates. These findings are consistent with experimental observations. Furthermore, we find that the sliding motion of the protein is driven by thermal fluctuations rather than Brownian diffusion. Finally, our simulations suggest that the formation of loops may play an important role in regulating gene expression.

{"text":"We report on the radio spectral evolution during a solar flare that was observed by RHESSI in 2002 February 18, which is one of the most energetic impulsive solar flares ever recorded with high energy electrons up to ~100 MeV. The flare started at about 17:45 UT as a GOES class M5.7 event peaking around 18:10 UT. It showed two peaks in its hard X-ray light curve (HXR); the first peak lasted only 3 minutes while the second peak lasted more than 10 minutes. We found that there were three distinct phases in the radio spectrum evolution: pre-flare phase, impulsive phase, and decay phase. In addition, we also found that the radio emission had a clear correlation between the HXR fluxes and microwave flux densities. During the impulsive phase, the radio emission increased rapidly and then decayed slowly after the end of the impulsive phase."}

We find no evidence for any infrared excess emission indicative of dust formation around the central star. Optical spectra reveal strong P-Cygni profiles indicating mass loss rates as high as 10^-5 M_sol\/yr. In addition to these features we detect narrow absorption lines which are likely due to interstellar material along our line-of-sight towards the star. Finally, we present Chandra ACIS-S X-ray images showing extended diffuse emission surrounding the radio source. This emission may be associated with shocked gas produced by stellar winds or outflows from the central star."}

{"text":"We present the spectral index distribution (SID) of blazars detected by the Energetic Gamma Ray Experiment Telescope (EGRET). The SID is derived using two different methods, and we find that both give consistent results within statistical errors. We compare our results with those obtained in previous studies based on smaller samples or limited energy ranges. Our sample contains all sources listed as \"blazar candidates\" in the Third EGRET Catalog (3EG), which includes 157 objects. In addition to these 3EG blazars, we include four more BL Lacertae-type objects whose radio properties are similar to those of known blazars but have not been included in any previous study due to their lack of detection at high energies. These additional sources were found through cross-correlation between the V\u00e9ron-Cetty & V\u00e9ron catalog of active galactic nuclei and the NRAO VLA Sky Survey. Using this combined sample consisting of 161 blazars, we calculate the fraction of flat-spectrum (FSRQ-like) and steep-spectrum (BL Lac-like) blazars among the total number of blazars observed by EGRET. This fraction depends strongly on the assumed value of the high-energy cutoff E_cutof f . For example, if we assume E_cutof f = 10 GeV, then FSRQ-like blazars constitute about 80% of the entire population; however, if we adopt an extremely low value such as 1 MeV, only 20% of the blazars can be classified as FSRQ-like."}
{"text":"We present an improved semi-analytical method (SAM) that includes gravitational heating by dark matter halos and gas cooling in galaxy formation, which is essential to reproduce observed properties of galaxies such as luminosity functions at different redshifts.  We show that our SAM can successfully explain the evolution of the stellar mass function over cosmic time with reasonable parameters. In addition, we find that the inclusion of gravitational heating leads to more realistic predictions on the star formation rate density history than previous models without this effect. Finally, we discuss how the model could be further improved by including other physical processes like supernova feedback or AGN activity.

{"text":"We present an analysis of the ages, metallicities and distances to nearby main-sequence F-type dwarf stars (d < 25 pc) using high-resolution spectroscopy obtained with the HARPS spectrograph on board of the European Space Agency's space observatory COROT. We find that there is no correlation between stellar metallicity and distance from the Sun within this sample. This result suggests that the local thin disk has not been significantly affected by radial migration processes over its lifetime.  The lack of any significant trend in [Fe\/H] as a function of distance also implies that the mean age of the local thin disk does not vary strongly across the solar neighbourhood. Using our derived ages we show that the age distribution of the local thin disk can be well described by a single exponential decay law with characteristic timescale \u03c4 = 3 Gyr. Our results are consistent with previous studies based on Hipparcos parallaxes but provide more accurate ages due to the higher precision of the spectroscopic data used here."}
{"text":"We present the results of an analysis of gravitational wave data collected by the LIGO and Virgo detectors during the first observing run (O1) in 2015, which includes two candidate events for binary neutron star mergers.

In particular we consider scalar-tensor theories where the coupling between matter fields and the metric is mediated by a light scalar field. These theories are motivated by string theory and have been studied extensively over many decades. \n \n For each event, we perform Bayesian model selection using simulated signals generated from both GR and several representative scalartensor theories. Our results show no evidence for deviations from GR within current uncertainties.

{"text":"We study the dynamics of vortex-antivortex pairs created by sudden switching on and off an external magnetic field in a Josephson junction between two superfluids with different densities, which is realized experimentally using liquid helium-4 (LHe) and 3 He-B phases. We show that the pair can be trapped at the interface for a finite time even if it has opposite charges. The lifetime of this state depends strongly on the initial distance between the vortices as well as their charge signs. In particular, we find that the lifetime increases exponentially when the initial separation decreases or the difference in density becomes smaller. This behavior may provide us with new ways to control the motion of vortex-antivortexes in experiments. \n \n Introduction \n \n Vortex matter plays important roles not only in classical fluids but also in quantum ones such as superfluid 4 He and superconductors [1\u20133] . Recently, there have been many studies on the creation and manipulation of vortex states in various systems [4\u201310] , including those involving topological defects [11\u201318] .\n \nIn this Letter, we consider a system consisting of two superfluids with distinct densities separated by a thin barrier [19, 20] . By applying a magnetic field perpendicularly to the junction plane [21] , one can create vortex-antivortex (VA) pairs near the junction [22] . If these VA pairs are released into the bulk region far away from the junction, they will move apart due to mutual repulsion [23] . However, if the pair moves close enough to the junction, its interaction with the interface could lead to interesting phenomena. For example, it was shown theoretically [24] and confirmed experimentally [25] that a single vortex can be trapped at the junction for a certain period of time after being injected into LHe-3 He-B. It should be noted here that the trapping mechanism proposed in Ref. 24 relies on the fact that the vortex core size is much larger than the thickness of the junction layer. Therefore, it cannot explain how a VA pair can be trapped at a junction since each member of the pair carries a unit winding number around the vortex"}
{"text":"We present observations of the Mg II k line asymmetry during flares, which are compared with results obtained by numerical simulations using the RH code (Uitenbroek 2001). The observed profiles show that the blue wing is enhanced relative to the red one at all heights above the limb where we can see the flare emission. This effect is more pronounced for higher altitudes. We find that this behavior cannot be explained solely by Doppler shifts due to bulk plasma motions along the LOS. In addition, our modeling shows that the observed profile shapes cannot be reproduced without including nonthermal electron beams as an additional heating source. \n \n Keywords: Solar flare, chromospheric lines, nonthermal electrons, radiative hydrodynamics model, RH code, Mg II k line, line asymmetry. 1 Introduction \n \n During solar flares, intense energy release leads to rapid changes in physical conditions throughout the atmosphere of the Sun. These include temperature increases up to several million degrees Kelvin, strong magnetic fields, high densities, and large velocities. All these factors affect the shape of spectral lines emitted by different atmospheric layers. For example, it has been shown that the intensity ratio between two Fe I lines formed at different temperatures depends on the height of formation of each line (Feldman et al., 1995; Brosius & Phillips 2004) . Also, the presence of nonthermal electrons causes significant deviations from Maxwellian velocity distributions leading to asymmetric line profiles (e.g., Canfield et al. (1990) ; Doschek et al. (1991) ), while bulk flows lead to Doppler shifts of the line center position (Doschek et al., 1991; Brosius & Phillips 2004; Brosius 2009 ). Therefore, studying the temporal evolution of the line profiles provides important information about the dynamics of the flaring region. However, interpreting such data requires detailed knowledge of the underlying physics involved in the processes responsible for the observed phenomena. \n \n In particular, the study of the Mg II h&k lines offers unique opportunities to investigate various aspects of solar flares because they form over a wide range"}
{"text":"We have performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study the structural relaxation and vibrational properties of a model polymer melt at different temperatures, ranging from 0 K up to 300 K. The results show that there is no significant change for the structure factor S(q), which indicates that the local structures are not changed by temperature variation. However, we find that the density fluctuation decreases with increasing temperature T. This can be explained as follows. At high temperatures, the thermal fluctuations become more important than the intermolecular interactions so that the particles tend to move freely without forming any ordered structures. In addition, it has been found that the mean square displacement <r2> increases linearly with time t over all studied temperatures. We also calculate the self-diffusion coefficient D using Einstein's relation <r2>=2Dt. It shows that D increases rapidly when T>100K but remains almost unchanged below 100K."}
{"text":"We present new multi-color photometric data for the globular cluster M75 (NGC6864) obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3, which allow us to study its horizontal branch stars in unprecedented detail.

The blue tail of the observed HB can be explained by assuming an age difference between these two groups of about 1 Gyr. Using our new HST observations we also derive accurate absolute ages for both sub-populations. Our results show that the redder population has an age of 12.6 \u00b1 0.2 Gyr while the bluer one is younger at 11.7 \u00b1 0.1 Gyr.

{"text":"Transcription factors (TFs) are proteins that bind specific sequences in the genome and regulate gene expression by recruiting other regulatory molecules or directly modulating RNA polymerase activity. The identification of TF binding sites is an important step towards understanding how genes are regulated, but it remains challenging due to their short length and degenerate sequence patterns. In this work we present a novel computational method for predicting TF binding sites based on a random walk model on a one-dimensional (1D) or two-dimensional (2D) lattice representing the DNA molecule. We show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods when applied to several datasets containing experimentally validated binding sites. Our results suggest that the proposed algorithm can be used as part of a pipeline for identifying putative binding sites in large genomic regions. Transcription factors (TFs), which include zinc finger proteins, homeodomain proteins, basic helix-loop-helix proteins, and others [1] , play key roles in regulating gene expression [2] . They bind specific sequences in the promoter region of target genes [3] and recruit other regulatory molecules such as coactivators [4] or corepressors [5] , or they may directly affect the rate at which RNA polymerases synthesize messenger RNAs [6] .\nThe identification of TF binding sites has been shown to be useful for studying gene regulation [7, 8] . However, it remains difficult because these sites have very short lengths [9] and exhibit highly degenerate sequence patterns [10] . Several algorithms have been developed to predict TF binding sites [11] ; however, most existing approaches suffer from high false positive rates [12] . For example, the widely-used position weight matrix (PWM)-based motif finding algorithms [13] cannot accurately identify TF binding sites [14] . This problem arises mainly because PWM models assume independence between positions within motifs [15] , while real TF binding sites often contain dependencies among adjacent bases [16] . To address this issue, some researchers have attempted to incorporate higher-order interactions into PWMs [17] . Other studies have focused on developing probabilistic graphical models [18] , hidden Markov models [19] , support vector machines [20] , and neural networks [21] ."}

{"text":"We present the results of our analysis on GRB 080916C, one of the most energetic bursts ever detected by Swift\/BAT and Fermi\/GBM. We find that this burst is consistent with being produced in an off-axis jet viewed at an angle \u03b8 ~ 60\u00b0 to its axis. The observed light curve can be explained as emission from two components: (1) A bright component which peaks early during the prompt phase; it has a duration T90 = 1 s and a fluence F\u03b3 = 2\u00d710\u22126 erg cm\u22122. (2) An extended tail lasting for several hundred seconds after the end of the prompt phase; it contains about half of the total energy emitted by the source. Using detailed modeling we show that both these features are naturally reproduced if the burst was generated within a dense stellar wind environment surrounding a Wolf-Rayet star. In particular, we demonstrate how the density profile of such winds leads to a double-peaked structure in the time integrated spectrum of the burst."}
{"text":"The question is not new, but it has been recently revived by the publication of two papers in Nature and Science that claim to show that biodiversity loss leads to ecosystem collapse.  The authors argue that this finding should be taken seriously because ecosystems are essential for human well-being.   They also point out that there have been many previous studies showing that biodiversity loss can lead to declines in ecosystem functioning (e.g., productivity) without necessarily causing an abrupt change in state or collapse.    In this article we review these recent findings on biodiversity-ecosystem function relationships as well as some earlier results suggesting that biodiversity may sometimes enhance rather than reduce ecosystem stability.  We conclude with a discussion about how our understanding of biodiversity-ecosystem function interactions could be improved through further research. Biodiversity loss is one of humanity's greatest challenges today. It threatens the sustainability of natural resources used directly by humans such as food production systems and water supply, and indirectly via changes in climate regulation and disease transmission pathways. There is growing concern over the rate at which species extinction rates are increasing globally due to anthropogenic activities including habitat destruction, pollution, overexploitation, and invasive alien species1\u20133. This situation has led to calls for urgent action to conserve biological diversity4\u20136. However, despite widespread recognition of the importance of conserving biodiversity7\u201310, there remains considerable uncertainty regarding its role in maintaining ecosystem functions11\u201313. A number of theoretical models suggest that biodiversity loss will cause reductions in ecosystem functioning14\u201316. For example, Tilman et al. (1997)17 showed theoretically that reducing plant species richness would decrease primary productivity in grassland communities. Similarly, Naeem & Li (1998)18 found experimentally that removing species from soil microcosms reduced decomposition rates. These predictions were supported by numerous subsequent empirical studies19\u201322."}

Then, we extend our results to multi-way relay channels with more than two users.  Finally, we investigate the performance of PLNC under imperfect channel state information (CSI). The main contributions are summarized as follows:  1. Two-way Relay Channels: We propose a novel approach to perform PLNC at the sources simultaneously based on linear codes over finite fields.   2. Multi-Way Relay Channels: By extending our previous work, we develop a new method to perform PLNC at all source nodes simultaneously.  3.

These are mainly sandy silts with an admixture of gravel particles up to 5 mm in diameter; they contain numerous mollusk shells, bones of terrestrial mammals, and other remains of biota. Based on these materials, we reconstructed the history of climatic fluctuations in the study area since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) until today."}

INTRODUCTIO N   A number of recent experiments have observed charmonium-like states near the threshold for open charm production [1] , some of them being interpreted as tetraquark candidates [2] .  These new states may play important roles in understanding nonperturbative QCD dynamics [3] .\nIn this work we focus our attention on one such state, the so-called X(3872), whose mass lies just above the DD * threshold [4] . This state has been studied extensively experimentally [5] - [8] but its nature remains unclear [9] . It was first discovered in 2003 [10] through its decays into J\/\u03c8\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and J\/\u03c8\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 . Subsequently it was found also in the decay channel B \u2192 XK [11] where K stands for K S or K L [12] . Its quantum numbers were determined to be 1 ++ [13] . Recently Belle [14] reported evidence for another resonance structure close to the X(3872). They call it Y(4140) and find it in the same decay mode as X(3872).\nTheoretically there exist many models trying to explain the properties of these exotic mesons [15] - [17] . However none of those approaches seems to provide a satisfactory description of all available data [18] . One possible explanation could be that more than one mechanism contributes to their formation [19] . For example, if the X(3872) is indeed a mixture of cc\u0304 and"}
{"text":"We study how the presence of a central supermassive black hole (SMBH) affects the dynamical evolution and mass loss rate of an open cluster with N = 10, 000 stars in virial equilibrium. We use direct N-body simulations to follow the long-term evolution of this system for up to 1 Gyr. The SMBH is modeled as a point particle that interacts gravitationally only with the most bound particles of each star cluster orbiting it. Our results show that the presence of the SMBH causes significant changes in the structure of the open cluster over time. In particular, we find that:  -The open cluster loses about half its initial total mass within 0.5 Gyr due to tidal stripping by the SMBH.  -The open cluster becomes more spherical after being tidally stripped by the SMBH. -The open cluster develops a core-halo structure where the density profile follows a power law at large radii but has a flat distribution near the center."}
{"text":"In this work, we present the design and analysis of space-time block codes (STBC) based on extended clifford algebras. The proposed STBC is constructed by using an orthogonal basis for the underlying algebra. We show that our code has full diversity order with respect to quasi-static Rayleigh fading channels. Furthermore, it achieves maximum coding gain over all other known algebraic STBCs in terms of minimum determinant criterion. Finally, we provide simulation results which demonstrate the performance gains achieved by the proposed scheme compared to existing schemes. Index Terms -Space time block codes, Algebraic coding theory, Quasi-static Rayleigh faded channel, Minimum determinant criterion. I. INTRODUCTIO N Space Time Block Codes (STBC), introduced by Alamouti [1] , are widely used in wireless communications due to their simple structure and high data rate [2] . In recent years there have been many efforts devoted towards designing new classes of STBCs [3] - [8] .\nThe main goal behind these designs was to achieve higher spectral efficiency while maintaining good error performances under different transmission conditions such as multipath propagation or frequency selective fading [9] . However, most of the existing works focus only on achieving better error performances without considering the effect of hardware limitations [10] . This motivates us to develop a class of STBCs which can be implemented efficiently at low complexity [11] .\nRecently, several authors [12] - [14] have shown that some well-known families of finite fields like Galois field GF(q) [15] , Finite Ring [16] , Quaternion [17] etc., can also be represented by certain types of non-commutative rings called Clifford algebras [18] . These representations allow one to construct various signal constellations [19] , modulation techniques [20] , and communication systems [21] . Motivated by these facts, in [22] , we presented a novel construction of STBCs based on representation of Clifford algebras. It was shown that the proposed STBC provides significant improvement in bit error rates (BER) when compared to conventional STBCs [23] ."}
{"text":"We present results for the differential cross section and spin observables in the reaction d(e, e')pn at energies below the deuteron breakup threshold. The calculations are performed within the framework of the covariant spectator theory (CST). We use an effective Lagrangian approach to describe the interaction between nucleons and photons. In this work we consider only one-loop corrections to the CST amplitudes which include contributions from intermediate states with two pions or one pion and one photon. These corrections lead to significant changes in the calculated cross sections as compared to previous works where these effects were not taken into account. \n \n Our results show that the inclusion of loop corrections leads to a better agreement with experimental data on the angular distribution of the emitted proton. However, there is still some discrepancy between our theoretical predictions and experiment especially near the kinematical boundary. This may be due to higher-order corrections and\/or uncertainties related to the choice of parameters used in the model."}
{"text":"The Minimal Supergravity (mSUGRA) model is one of the most studied supersymmetric extensions to the Standard Model, predicting five free parameters which are constrained by measurements performed at LEP1, Tevatron Run I and II experiments as well as by cosmological observations. In this work we present results on searches for direct production of squarks and gluinos decaying into jets plus missing transverse energy using data collected during 2010-2012 proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 7TeV recorded by the ATLAS experiment at Large Hadron Collider. The analysis uses two different search strategies based either on jet multiplicity or on kinematic properties of events. No significant excess over the background expectation has been observed. Upper limits have been set on the cross section times branching ratio for each signal hypothesis considered. These results are interpreted within the context of the mSUGRA model assuming that R-parity is conserved."}

{"text":"We present an analysis of the Swift\/BAT light curve for GRB 060912, which is one of only two bursts to have been classified as both a \"long-soft\" (LS) and a \"short-hard\" (SH) event by the BAT team.  We find that this classification is not robust against changes in the background model used or variations in the time binning applied; we also show that it does not hold up when compared with other LS events observed by Swift. In addition, we demonstrate that the spectral evolution seen during the prompt phase cannot be explained within either the SH or LS models. Finally, we argue that the most likely explanation for these observations is that GRB 060912 was actually a single pulse lasting several hundred seconds, rather than being composed of multiple pulses separated by quiescent intervals. The results presented here suggest that there may exist a continuum of properties between the classes of long-short gamma-ray bursts currently defined by the BAT team."}
{"text":"We report on an experiment that tests the predictions of quantum mechanics and local hidden variable theories for two entangled photons in a Bell state, using polarization-entanglement swapping to create a loophole-free Bell inequality violation.  The experiment is performed with a source of polarization-entangled photon pairs produced by spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) in a nonlinear crystal pumped by a continuous-wave laser at 405 nm.   A half wave plate rotates one of the photons' polarizations by 45 degrees before it enters a beam splitter which separates the pair into two spatially separated beams.   One of these beams passes through a quarter wave plate oriented such that its fast axis makes an angle of 22.5 degrees relative to horizontal; this transforms the horizontally polarized component of the beam's electric field vector into vertically polarized light.   After passing through another quarter wave plate whose fast axis is aligned with vertical, both components are transformed back into horizontally polarized light.   This transformation can be represented as follows:  H \u2192 V \u2192 H = HVH.   The other beam travels directly to Alice's measurement station where she performs measurements along three different axes corresponding to projections onto the basis states |V>, |H>, and |D>, where D denotes diagonal.

{"text":"We report the observation of dynamic condensation of water vapor on crack tips during slow fracture experiments performed under vacuum conditions (10-6 mbar) and low temperature (77 K). The condensed water is found to be localized along the crack front, where it forms a thin film that covers the entire surface of the crack tip. This phenomenon has been observed for cracks propagating both perpendicularly and parallel to the direction of maximum tensile stress. We propose a model based on molecular dynamics simulations which explains this effect by considering the presence of an electric field generated by the moving crack tip. In addition we show how the formation of such films can affect the mechanical properties of the material. Condensation phenomena are ubiquitous in nature but have rarely been reported in materials science. Here we present experimental evidence showing that water condenses onto the crack surfaces when they propagate through fused silica glasses. These results were obtained using a combination of optical microscopy techniques with environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM), Raman spectroscopy and infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRAS)."}

We show that this code is able to reproduce previous results obtained by other authors using different codes (e.g., JETSPEC), as well as some new results which have not been previously reported in the literature. In particular we find that:  1) The disk becomes unstable when its luminosity exceeds a critical value Lcrit = 0.1LEdd.  2) For super-Eddington luminosities there are two types of instability modes: one associated with thermal convection and another related to photon bubbles.  3) There exists an upper limit on the mass flux through the disk, above which no steady state solution can be found. This result has important implications for models of AGN feedback. 4) When the luminosity approaches or exceeds LEdd, the disk develops strong outflows along the equatorial plane."}
{"text":"We present an approach for self-organization in networks based on multi-agent systems (MAS). The proposed method is applied to two different networks: one with mobile nodes and another with static ones, both using IEEE 802.11b as their communication protocol. In this work we use agents that are able to move between neighboring nodes, which allows them to collect information about the state of each node. This information can be used by other agents to make decisions such as: moving to new positions or changing the transmission power level. We have implemented our proposal in NS-2 simulator and compared it against three well-known algorithms: OLSR, AODV and DSR.

{"text":"We present the results of our analysis on simulated galaxy clusters, which are used to study how different physical processes affect SZ observables (profiles and scaling relations). We use hydrodynamical simulations performed with GADGET-2 code in order to investigate the effect of: gas clumping, AGN feedback, cooling flows, mergers, triaxiality and orientation of the cluster relative to observer's line-of-sight. The main conclusions are:  - Gas clumpiness has an important impact on SZ observable quantities such as integrated Comptonization parameter Y500 or pressure profile P(r), especially at small radii.  - Cooling flow regions have lower values for Y500 than expected by self-similar model predictions due to their low temperature and density compared to other parts of the cluster.  - Mergers can significantly change the shape of the pressure profile leading to higher central pressures and steeper slopes towards outer parts.  - Triaxiality affects both the amplitude and slope of the pressure profile depending on its orientation wrt. the observer's line-of-sigh.  - Inclination angle between the major axis of the cluster and the observer's line-ofsight is one of the most significant factors affecting the observed properties of galaxy clusters."}
{"text":"We present measurements of galaxy clustering on scales between 1 and 100 h-1 Mpc, using data from the Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS). We use photometric redshifts to select samples with different luminosities at z = 0.5-0.8. The correlation function is measured for each sample by counting pairs as a function of separation angle. We find that the amplitude of the correlation function increases strongly with luminosity over this range. This trend can be explained if we assume that more luminous galaxies are biased towards higher density regions than less luminous ones. In addition, we measure the evolution of the bias factor with redshift. Our results show that the bias factor evolves rapidly out to z ~1 but then flattens off beyond this point. These findings suggest that the growth rate of dark matter haloes decreases significantly after z ~1. Finally, we compare our results with those obtained from numerical simulations."}
{"text":"We present results of our numerical simulations of the interaction between the fast stellar winds and the slow dense shell ejected during previous eruption in the recurrent nova RS Oph (T Sco). We find that the observed X-ray light curve can be reproduced by assuming an initial mass loss rate of ~10-6 Msun\/yr for the red giant component, which is consistent with theoretical predictions.  The predicted temperature structure of the shocked region agrees well with the observationally inferred one. Our model also predicts that the optical depth to X-rays should increase as time goes on because of the increasing density of the ejecta. This prediction seems to be supported by recent Swift\/XRT observations. In addition we show that the observed UV fluxes are not explained by the standard steady state photoionization model but require additional heating source such as shocks or magnetic reconnection. Finally we discuss possible scenarios for future evolution of this system based on our numerical results."}
{"text":"We present an algorithm for inferring the structure and parameters of a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) using only first-order or second-order conditional independence tests, which are computationally much cheaper than higher-order tests. The DBN is inferred by applying our method to each time point separately in a sliding window fashion. We show that this approach can be used to accurately reconstruct gene regulatory networks from high-throughput data such as microarray experiments. Our results on synthetic datasets demonstrate that we achieve similar accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods while being orders of magnitude faster. Finally, we apply our method to two real-world biological datasets and compare it against several other approaches. Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs) have been successfully applied to model complex systems whose states evolve over time. However, learning these models has proven challenging due to their large number of parameters and the computational complexity involved in estimating them. In particular, exact inference algorithms scale exponentially with respect to the size of the dataset and the number of variables considered. To overcome this problem, many approximate inference techniques have been proposed recently. These include variational approximations [1] , expectation propagation [2] , Monte Carlo sampling [3] , and message passing [4] . While these methods allow us to learn more accurate models at the cost of increased running times, they still require expensive computations involving all possible interactions between pairs of nodes. This makes them unsuitable when dealing with large-scale problems where the number of observations and\/or variables becomes too large."}
{"text":"We study the vacant set of random interlacements in Rd, d>1, which is defined as the complement of the union of all open paths starting at 0 up to time 1. We prove that it has Hausdorff dimension equal to d-1 almost surely by showing that its upper Minkowski dimension equals this value with probability one. This result extends previous results on the vacant set of simple random walk obtained by Lawler, Schramm and Werner (Annals of Probability 24(3), 1997) and Benjamini, Kalai and Schramm (Journal of Functional Analysis 157(1), 2000). The proof relies heavily on recent developments concerning the geometry of Brownian motion and the theory of stable processes. In particular we use an estimate for the Green function of the killed Brownian motion due to Bass and Burdzy (Annales de l'Institut Henri Poincare 22(2), 1999).\nThe main motivation behind our work comes from percolation theory where the vacant set of random walks plays a crucial role.

In addition to this perturbative check, we perform numerical checks of our results against exact solutions of the Klein-Gordon equation in Schwarzschild spacetime. Finally, we discuss how our approach can be used to calculate corrections beyond the semiclassical approximation. The evaporation of black holes has been studied extensively over many years (see e.g. ), but there remain some open questions about its detailed behaviour. One such question concerns the precise form of the spectrum of emitted particles; it was shown recently  that the standard semi-classical treatment leads to a thermal distribution of particle energies, but it remains unclear whether or not this result holds true once quantum gravity effects become important."}
{"text":"We study the diffusion processes on small-world networks, where each node is connected to its nearest neighbors and some randomly chosen nodes in the network. We show that for any given initial distribution of particles at time t = 0, there exists an explicit formula for the probability density function (PDF) of finding a particle at position x at time t. The PDF has two terms corresponding to the contributions from the local diffusive process and global random walk respectively. In particular, we find that the mean square displacement grows as $(t^{1\/2} + t^{3\/2})$ when $t \\rightarrow \\infty$. This result shows that the diffusion processes are super-diffusive if the number of random links per node is large enough. Finally, by using numerical simulations, we verify our theoretical results.

The experiments are performed at room temperature and atmospheric pressure conditions. Our results confirm that volume entropy always increases with time as predicted by theory. This result also confirms that our measurement system works properly. Finally, we discuss some possible applications of our approach.

Many extensions of the SM predict additional contributions to the effective four-fermion interaction Lagrangian [6] which could lead to observable deviations from the predictions of the SM [7, 8] .

{"text":"We present new results on modelling the effects of clumps in stellar winds on their observed linear and circular polarization signatures, using Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations. We find that for stars with high mass-loss rates (\u1e40 > 10-7 M\u2299 yr-1), the presence of clumps can significantly affect both the degree and angle of linear polarization produced by scattering processes within the wind. For lower mass loss rate objects (\u1e40 < 10-7 M\u2299yr-1) we find that the effect is less pronounced but still significant enough to be detectable at certain wavelengths. The predicted changes are found to depend strongly upon the properties of the individual clumps; specifically, they increase as the number density contrast between the clumps and surrounding medium increases. In addition, we show how these predictions may be used to constrain the physical parameters describing the clumpy structure of the wind.  These findings have important implications for future observations of hot-star winds which will be made possible through the use of next-generation instruments such as SPHERE\/VLT and GPI\/Gemini Observatory."}
{"text":"The extraction of fresh water and energy from the atmosphere is proposed as an alternative to conventional sources, which are limited in supply or environmentally damaging.  The process involves condensing atmospheric moisture into liquid water using solar power and then collecting this water on a surface coated with hydrophobic materials that allow it to be easily transported by air currents.   This technology could provide clean drinking water for remote communities without requiring large amounts of land area or infrastructure investment. It also has potential applications in agriculture where irrigation can be provided at low cost through the use of wind-driven sprayers. In addition, the collected water may be used directly as fuel if combined with electrolysis cells powered by renewable electricity. The process requires minimal maintenance once installed and would operate continuously over many years. A pilot-scale demonstration system was constructed near Tucson Arizona (USA) during 2011-2013.

The temperature dependence of resistivity shows metallic behavior down to lowest measured temperatures for all compositions studied. In addition, we observe a pronounced maximum in the resistivity around 50-100 K depending on composition that is attributed to the formation of heavy fermion bands due to hybridization between conduction electrons and localized f-electrons. We also find evidence for the presence of two different types of charge carriers contributing to the conductivity. \n \n For x=0.1-0.15, the magnetic susceptibility follows Curie-Weiss law above 100-150 K indicating the presence of local moments.

This behavior can be explained by considering the effect of lattice expansion due to thermal fluctuations at high temperatures. In addition, we find that the magnitude of EPC depends strongly on film thickness; it becomes smaller when the film thickness decreases down to 10 unit cells. The observed dependence of EPC on both temperature and film thickness suggests that phonon confinement plays an important role in determining the strength of EPC in these materials. Manganese oxides have been extensively studied because they exhibit many interesting physical properties such as colossal magnetoresistance [1] , metal-insulator transition [2] , and charge ordering [3] . Among them, La1-xSrxMnO3 has attracted much attention since its discovery [4] .\nIn this compound, Mn ions are located at two different sites, i.e., Mn3+(tetrahedral site) and Mn4+(octahedral site). It was found that the magnetic ground state changes from ferromagnetic insulator to antiferromagnetic insulator upon increasing x [5] . These phenomena were attributed to the competition between double exchange interaction [6] and superexchange interaction [7, 8] . However, there still remain some open questions about the origin of the electronic states in these compounds [9] . For example, the mechanism responsible for the insulating nature of these materials remains controversial [10] ."}

{"text":"We present the results of our analysis of molecular gas mass estimates based on CO and HCN observations in nearby galaxies, using data obtained with the IRAM 30m telescope. We find that conversion factors between luminosity and mass are strongly dependent on the star formation rate (SFR) per unit area within each galaxy disk. The SFR surface density is found to be an important parameter controlling the conversion factor XCO = M(H2)\/L(CO), which we derive by fitting the observed L(HCN) \/ L(CO) ratio versus metallicity relation.

We use high-resolution N-body simulations to calculate the USSDs at redshifts z = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 . The results show that the USSDs are independent of redshift within our numerical accuracy. However, they do depend strongly on halo mass; more massive halos have larger USSDs than less massive ones. This is consistent with previous studies based on semi-analytic models or hydrodynamic simulations. In addition, we also find that there exists an upper limit to the number density of subhalos around any given host halo. Finally, by comparing the simulated USSDs with observations, we conclude that it may be possible to detect fossil groups using future surveys such as LSST."}

{"text":"We study the effects of general relativity on gravitational wave bursts produced by extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs). We show that, for EMRI systems with total masses M = 10^6M_solar and compact object masses m = 1M_neutron star, the orbital period is less than one second at distances greater than 100 AU. This implies that these sources are likely to be detected as continuous waves rather than short-duration bursts. The detection rate of such events depends strongly upon their luminosities; we find that they may occur up to several times per year within our galaxy. These results suggest that EMRIs could provide an important source of information about supermassive black holes. \n \n Keywords: Black hole, Compact binary system, General relativity, Gravitational wave, Inspiralling neutron star, Relativity theory \n \n \n \n INTRODUCTION \n \n In recent years there has been considerable interest in studying the properties of gravitational radiation emitted during the final stages of stellar evolution when a massive star collapses into a black hole or neutron star [1] . Such processes can produce extremely energetic signals which will be detectable out to cosmological distances using future space-based detectors [2] , including LISA [3] . However, it remains unclear how many of these events should actually be observed [4] . \n \n One possible class of objects which might emit strong gravitational waves are known as \"extreme-mass-ratio inspirals\" (EMRIs) [5] . Here, a small compact object spirals into a much more massive black hole or neutron star over millions of orbits before being destroyed [6] . For example, if a solar mass star were to spiral into a ten million solar mass black hole then its orbit would shrink down to just a few kilometres before merging [7, 8] . If this process occurs close enough to the event horizon then the resulting signal will have very high frequencies [9] . As a result, EMRIs represent some of the most promising candidates for detecting gravitational waves [10] ."}

For temperatures T > Tc it is found that the entropy per spin increases linearly with the number N of spins in the system while for T < Tc it decreases exponentially fast with increasing N .

{"text":"The effect of oxygen vacancies (V) on the magnetic properties of titanium dioxide was investigated by using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy and magnetization measurements.  The results show that V can induce ferromagnetic ordering at room temperature with an effective moment of 1.6\u03bcB per formula unit. This is attributed to the formation of small clusters of V ions which are antiferromagnetically coupled through superexchange interactions between neighboring O-2p orbitals. These findings provide new insights into the origin of ferromagnetism observed in some transition metal oxides. Titanium dioxide has been widely used as photocatalysts for water splitting under visible light irradiation due to its high activity and stability [1] .

{"text":"We compare the performance of two different methods to simulate non-equilibrium dynamics in polymer systems, namely dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) with either a Nos\u00e9-Hoover or a Langevin thermostat. We show that both DPD schemes are able to reproduce qualitatively similar results when compared against each other as well as experiments on the stretching of single DNA molecules. However, we find significant quantitative differences between the two approaches which can be traced back to the fact that they use fundamentally different equations of motion. In particular, we demonstrate how these differences affect the relaxation behavior after an external force is applied to the chain ends. Finally, we discuss possible ways to overcome some of the shortcomings associated with the current implementations. \n \n Introduction \n \n The study of complex fluids such as polymers requires sophisticated simulation techniques capable of describing their unique properties at various length scales. While atomistic molecular dynamics has been successfully used to investigate phenomena occurring over short time and length scales [1\u20133], coarse-grained models have emerged as powerful tools to explore longer timescales [4\u20136]. These simplified descriptions typically involve representing groups of atoms by one effective interaction site [7\u20139]. For example, in the case of biopolymers like proteins [10\u201312] or nucleic acids [13\u201318], this approach allows us to capture essential features of the underlying physics while reducing computational costs significantly [19, 20]. \n \n Coarse-graining strategies often rely on mapping the interactions among individual particles onto effective potentials [21]. This simplification enables efficient sampling of configurational space using Monte Carlo [22] or Molecular Dynamics [23] algorithms. Despite its successes, however, coarse-graining comes at the cost of losing detailed information about local structure and fluctuations [24]. As a result, it becomes difficult to accurately describe processes involving large conformational changes [25]. To address this issue, hybrid multiscale modeling frameworks have recently been developed [26]. Here, coarsegrained representations are combined with more accurate microscopic models to provide better estimates of free energy surfaces [27] and transition rates [28]. \n \n Another important aspect of coarse-grained models concerns the choice of appropriate"}
{"text":"We study the geometry of harmonic maps into spheres with values in vector bundles over Riemann surfaces. We prove that if such a map is not constant then it has no critical points outside its singular set (Theorem 1). This implies that any harmonic section of an oriented rank 2 bundle over a closed surface can be deformed to a smooth one without changing its homotopy class (Corollary 3).\nIn particular we show how this result leads to new proofs for some results about instantons on 4-dimensional manifolds due to Donaldson [D1] , [D2] . In fact our proof gives more information than those given by Donaldson's arguments since it allows us to control the behavior of the harmonic section near its singularities. Finally we give examples showing that these results are sharp. The main theorem of this article states that every non-constant harmonic section of an oriented 2-plane bundle over a closed surface S can be deformed to another harmonic section which is smooth everywhere except at isolated points where it has only simple poles."}
{"text":"We study atom-waves in an optical lattice with periodic boundary conditions by solving numerically the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for different values of the laser intensity and detuning. We find that there is a crossover between two regimes depending on whether or not the recoil energy is larger than the kinetic energy of the atoms. In this work we focus on the case where the recoil energy is smaller than the kinetic energy (Raman-Nath regime). The effective Rabi frequency, losses and phase shifts are calculated as functions of the parameters characterizing the system. Our results show good agreement with previous theoretical works. Finally, we present our conclusions. Atom waves can be described using quantum mechanics when they interact with light fields. This interaction leads to interesting phenomena such as Bloch oscillations [1] , Zener tunneling [2] , Landau-Zener-St\u00fcckelberg-Majorana transitions [3] , and Anderson localization [4] . These effects have been studied both theoretically [5] - [8] and experimentally [9] - [11] .\nIn particular, it has recently become possible to create Bose-Einstein condensates [12] which allow one to observe these phenomena at low temperatures [13] - [16] . For example, in Ref. [17] , the authors observed Bloch oscillations in a cold atomic gas trapped inside an optical lattice created by counter-propagating lasers. They also found evidence of Zener tunneling [18] in their experiment. Moreover, in Refs. [19] and [20] , the authors investigated the effect of disorder on the transport properties of matter waves in optical lattices."}

The obtained formulae are expressed only in terms of elementary functions and thus provide explicit expressions for physical quantities that have been studied so far mainly numerically. In particular, we show that our result reproduces known results for the case where particles enter and exit at both ends of the system with equal rates. Furthermore, we obtain new results for the cases where particles enter and\/or exit at either end of the system with unequal rates. \nI. INTRODUCTIO N\n\nThe asymmetric simple exclusion process (AS EP)\nis one of the most fundamental models describing nonequilibrium phenomena [1] . It describes the dynamics of interacting particles hopping along a chain of L sites under the following rules: each site i = 1, ..., L contains at most one particle; if there is no particle at site i , then it hops rightward with rate p ; otherwise, it stays still. If there is already another particle at site i , however, this particle cannot move until the first particle moves away. This model has attracted much attention because its stationary state exhibits various interesting properties depending on boundary conditions [2] .\nIn recent years, several studies have focused on the so-called open-boundary condition [3] - [8] : Particles enter into the leftmost site of the chain with probability \u03b1 per unit time and leave from the rightmost site with probability \u03b2 per unit time. For example, when \u03b1 = \u03b2 = 1\/2, the stationary state becomes uniform regardless of the initial configuration [9] . On the other hand, when \u03b1 > \u03b2 , the stationary state shows phase separation [10] . Moreover, when \u03b1 < \u03b2 , the stationary state displays shock profiles [11] .

The sample consists of 1248 objects including both BL Lacertae-type and flat-spectrum radio quasars. Our main result is that there exists an anti-correlation between the radio emission produced by jets and the optical\/UV radiation emitted by disks. This effect can be explained if we assume that the jet power decreases as the disk luminosity increases. In addition to this general trend, we find evidence for two separate branches in the distribution of sources along the radio-optical plane. One branch corresponds to low-luminosity AGNs whose radio emission correlates positively with the disk luminosity; another one includes high-luminosity AGN where the radio emission anticorrelates strongly with the disk luminosity."}

{"text":"We present new numerical results on the structure of accretion disks in binary systems with a black hole (BH) as well as their observational signatures, including eclipses by the BH shadow and reflection features due to strong gravitational lensing. We consider two different types of models: one where the disk is geometrically thin but optically thick, and another where it has an extended atmosphere that can be either optically thick or thin depending on its density distribution. In both cases we find that the observed flux depends strongly on the inclination angle between the orbital plane and our line-of-sight. For low inclinations, the system appears bright because most of the emission comes directly from the disk surface facing us; at high inclinations, however, only a small fraction of this emission reaches us while most of it gets blocked by the BH itself. The resulting eclipse profiles are very sensitive to the spin parameter\u00e2\u20ac\u0160=\u00e2\u02c6\u0161\/M2 of the BH, which determines how much of the disk is obscured during each orbit.

{"text":"We study the high-speed collapse of two perfect fluids in cylindrical symmetry, with one fluid collapsing into another at constant speed and density ratio.  We find that for sufficiently large initial separation between the fluids there is no shock formation during the collapse process; instead, the fluids merge smoothly to form an intermediate state which then evolves towards equilibrium by radiating gravitational waves.  For smaller separations we observe the formation of shocks as expected.  In all cases studied here, the final outcome depends only on the total mass-energy of each fluid prior to merger, not their individual masses or densities.   The results presented here are relevant to astrophysical scenarios such as binary neutron star mergers and black hole-neutron star binaries. We consider the problem of merging two perfect fluids in cylindrical geometry, where one fluid collapses onto another at constant speed and fixed density ratio $\\eta$ (see Figure 1 ). This scenario arises naturally when studying the evolution of binary systems consisting of compact objects like neutron stars or black holes."}
{"text":"We present an approach for quantifying how much evolutionary history is likely to be lost if we lose particular species, and use this information to prioritize conservation efforts. We show that by considering both taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity simultaneously in conservation planning, it may be possible to conserve more biodiversity than would otherwise be achieved with either measure alone. \n \n The loss of any single species represents not only its own extinction but also the loss of all unique genetic variation within that lineage. This can have important consequences on ecosystem function as well as other aspects of biodiversity such as taxonomy or community composition. However, there are many ways to define what constitutes \"biodiversity\", each emphasizing different components of biological systems. In order to effectively protect biodiversity, it will therefore be necessary to consider multiple measures together rather than focusing solely on one aspect at a time. \n \n Here we propose a new method for measuring the amount of evolutionary history represented by a set of taxa (e.g., species) based on their relationships inferred using molecular data. Our approach uses the concept of \"evolutionary distinctiveness\" - which describes the uniqueness of each taxon relative to others in terms of shared evolutionary history - to calculate the expected contribution of individual species to overall phylogenetic diversity. By combining these values into a single index, we obtain a quantitative ranking of species according to their importance for preserving evolutionary history across a given taxonomic group. Using simulated datasets, we demonstrate that our proposed metric performs better than existing methods when used to identify key species for conserving phylogenetic diversity. Finally, we apply our method to assess the vulnerability of amphibian species to climate change impacts."}

Index Terms-Broadcasting, Data compression, Quantization, Rate-distortion theory, Successive refinement coding. I. INTRODUCTIO N In this work we study the problem of successive refinem ent coding (SRC) [1] , which consists on transmitting information over multiple stages such that the quality of reconstruction improves progressively. SRC is used extensively in video broadcasting applications [2] - [4] . For example, in digital television transmission, the base station sends a coarse description of the video sequence to mobile users via satellite links. Then, when these users get closer to their destination they request additional descriptions of higher resolution. This process continues until the user receives enough data to reconstruct the original signal without error [5] .\nIn general, there exist two different approaches to solve the SRC problem: 1) Joint source-channel coding: Here, the encoder jointly optimizes both source coding and channel coding [6]- [8] ; 2) Separate source-channel coding: Here, separate source coders and channel codes are employed [9] - [11] . In this case, the source code must provide some form of side-information so that the decoder can perform successive decoding [12] ."}
{"text":"We discuss how chiral symmetry is realized in QCD, with particular emphasis on its implications for the spectrum of excited states. We argue that the lowest-lying excitations are described by open strings attached to quarks at one end and antiquarks at the other; these can be viewed as mesons or glueballs depending on whether they carry color charge or not.  The next set of excitations corresponds to closed strings which wind around the compactified dimension (the time direction) once or more times. These correspond to baryon resonances. Finally we consider higher-spin excitations corresponding to multiple winding modes of the closed string; these have spin greater than two but still less than the number of colors Nc. In this talk I will present some recent results obtained using holographic methods applied to gauge theories dual to supergravity backgrounds. This approach has been very successful in describing many aspects of strongly-coupled gauge theory dynamics including confinement, chiral symmetry breaking, and the properties of light vector mesons. However it also provides an interesting new perspective on heavy quark physics such as the production of top-quark pairs in high-energy collisions."}
{"text":"We present the results on X-ray luminosity, temperature, gas mass fraction and YX (the product of these three quantities) for a sample of 62 galaxy clusters observed with XMM-Newton. We find that our data are consistent with self-similar evolution at low redshifts but show deviations from it at higher redshifts. The deviation is more pronounced when we use the SZ signal to estimate cluster masses instead of using the X-ray temperatures. This may be due to non-thermal pressure support or biases introduced by different selection effects between X-ray and SZ surveys. Our results suggest that the scatter around the mean relation increases towards high redshift. We also investigate how well the scaling relations can be used as cosmological probes. Using the current observational constraints on the Hubble constant H0 = 73 km s-1 Mpc-1 , matter density parameter Omega_m = 0.27 and dark energy equation-of-state w = -1, we find that the uncertainty in the derived values of Omega_m and w is dominated by systematic uncertainties rather than statistical errors."}
{"text":"We study effects of lepton flavour violation (LFV) in chargino production and decay at linear colliders, taking into account all relevant LFV interactions.

This enhancement results mainly from the fact that the coupling of neutralinos to taus is proportional to tan \u03b2 . The effect of this enhancement depends strongly on the mass difference between the lightest and second-lightest neutralinos. \n \n For small values of tan \u03b2 we find only moderate enhancements or even suppression of the branching ratios due to destructive interference among different contributions.

In addition, we found that the knots are surrounded by a shell-like structure whose radius ranges between 100 AU and 1000 AU."}
{"text":"We present the results of our study on mass-loss rates in luminous blue variables (LBVs) based on radio observations at 1.4 GHz with the VLA, as well as optical spectroscopy obtained by us or taken from the literature.  We find that LBV stars have typical mass-loss rates between 10^-6 M_sun\/yr to 10^-4 M_sun\/yr. The mass-loss rate is found to be correlated with luminosity but not with stellar radius. In addition we report quasi-periodic modulations of radio supernovae associated with SN 1987A and SN 1993J which are likely due to periodic changes in their circumstellar environments. These variations may also explain why these two objects were observed to undergo large amplitude outbursts during their late stages. This research was supported by NASA grant NAG5-7262.

{"text":"We present deep optical and near-infrared observations of two gamma-ray burst (GRB) host galaxies, which are located behind the Large Magellanic cloud (LMC). The LMC is an ideal laboratory for studying the effects of massive star winds on their surroundings because it contains many young open clusters with ages ranging between 1 Myr to several hundred million years old. We use these data to probe the geometry of the surrounding interstellar medium (ISM), as well as that of the stellar winds produced by the most recent generation of stars within each cluster. In particular we focus our attention on the properties of Wolf Rayet (WR) stars, whose powerful winds can have dramatic effects on their environments over large distances.  By comparing the observed line-of-sight column densities of hydrogen gas towards different clusters at various orientations relative to the plane of the galaxy, we find evidence for significant differences in the structure of the ISM along lines of sight passing through the disk compared to those passing through the halo. This suggests that there may be large-scale variations in the density distribution of the ISM throughout this region of space."}
{"text":"The electronic structure and optical properties of BaTiO3 are investigated by using the density functional theory (DFT) within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA). The calculated results show that the band gap is about 3 eV, which agrees well with experiment. It also shows that the valence bands mainly consist of O-2p states while conduction bands are dominated by Ti-3d states. In addition to this, we have studied the effect of pressure on the structural stability as well as electronic structures of BaTiO3. We find that under high pressures, the lattice parameters decrease gradually but the volume decreases rapidly at higher pressures. This indicates that BaTiO3 undergoes phase transition into tetragonal structure above 20 GPa. \n \n Keywords: Electronic Structure; Optical Properties; Pressure Effects; BaTiO3; Ab Initio; Generalized Gradient Approximation. 1 Introduction Barium Titanate (BaTiO3), one of the most important ferroelectric materials in solid state physics, has been widely used for various applications such as piezoelectrics [1] , electro-optics [2] , nonlinear optics [3] , photovoltaic devices [4] . Due to its unique physical characteristics like large dielectric constant [5] , low loss tangent [6] , high Curie temperature [7] etc., it finds wide application in microwave [8] , infrared [9] , terahertz [10] , and visible [11] regions. However, there still exist some problems associated with the material's performance [12] . For example, the leakage current increases significantly when the applied voltage exceeds certain value [13] .\nIn order to improve these performances, many researchers have tried different approaches including doping [14] , compositing [15] , surface modification [16] , and so forth [17] - [19] . Among them, doping is considered as one of the effective ways [20] . By introducing dopants into the host matrix, the electrical [21] , magnetic [22] , thermal [23] , mechanical [24] , and optical [25] properties can be tuned accordingly [26] ."}
{"text":"We present the first results on the soft X-ray emission in two nearby elliptical galaxies, NGC 2992 (M60) and NGC 3081 (M84). The observations were made with the Chandra X-Ray Observatory using the Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS-S3), which has an energy resolution of about 130 eV at 6 keV. We find that both galaxies show extended diffuse emission around their central regions. In addition, we detect several point sources within each galaxy's field-of-view. For these point sources, we have extracted spectra for individual source components as well as combined them into one spectrum per galaxy. Using spectral fitting techniques, we found that all but three of the detected point sources are consistent with being background AGNs or foreground stars. However, there is evidence that some of the brightest point sources may be associated with the host galaxies themselves. Finally, we also fit the diffuse component of the X-ray emission with thermal plasma models."}
{"text":"The crystal structure of the title compound, C7H14N2O4\u00b7H2O, has been determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis at room temperature.  The asymmetric unit contains one molecule of alanine in which both carboxylate groups are protonated to give an overall charge of +1. In the crystal lattice each amino acid is linked via O-H\u22efO hydrogen bonds into chains running parallel to [010] . These chains are further connected through N-H\u22efO hydrogen bonding interactions between adjacent molecules along the c-axis direction leading to layers perpendicular to (001). The water molecules form intermolecular O-H\u22efO and O-H\u22ef\u03c0 interactions with neighbouring amino acids within these layers. A comparison of bond lengths shows that there is no significant difference between the two polymorphic structures reported for this compound. This suggests that the differences observed in their physical properties may be due to different packing arrangements rather than changes in molecular conformation."}
{"text":"We present results for the chemical composition and temperature structure of two different models of dense molecular clouds, which are based on detailed microphysical calculations including gas-grain interactions. The first model is an isolated spherical core that collapses under its own gravity; it has been evolved up to densities of 10^8 cm^{-3}. In this case we find that grain-surface reactions play only a minor role because they occur mainly at low temperatures where the density is too small to allow efficient freeze-out onto grains. However, these processes can be important if the collapse proceeds faster than predicted by standard theory (e.g., due to magnetic fields). We also study the evolution of a protostellar envelope surrounding a newly formed star. Here we find that the formation of complex organic molecules such as methanol or formaldehyde requires high densities and relatively warm temperatures. This suggests that these species may not be abundant enough to explain their observed abundances in dark clouds unless additional sources of heating exist."}
{"text":"We present the chemical properties (metallicity, abundance ratios) for a sample of dwarf galaxies in the Local Volume with known distances and star formation histories. We use high quality spectra obtained at the Apache Point Observatory to derive oxygen abundances using both direct T e method as well as strong-line methods calibrated on H II regions in nearby spiral galaxies.  The derived metallicities range between 12+log(O\/H)=7.6-8.2 dex. These values are consistent with those found by previous studies based on optical spectroscopy. In addition we find that most of these dwarfs have supersolar N\/O ratio indicating recent or ongoing nitrogen enrichment due to massive stars. This is also supported by their low SFRs which prevent efficient dilution of the enriched gas produced by supernovae type Ia. Finally, we compare our results with theoretical predictions made by different chemical evolution models. Our analysis shows that none of them can reproduce simultaneously all observed quantities such as metallicity, N\/O ratio and sSFR."}
{"text":"The dynamical discrete web is an extension to the concept of the discrete web, which was introduced by Markose and Sukumar in 1998 as a tool for studying the dynamics of nonlinear systems. The main idea behind this approach is that one can use the information contained within the trajectories of the system under consideration to construct a network whose nodes are given by these trajectories themselves. This network has been shown to be useful in identifying important features such as attractors or periodic orbits embedded in the phase space of the system.  In this work we present some new results on the properties of the dynamical discrete web associated with dissipative chaotic maps. We show how it is possible to obtain accurate estimates of the fractal dimension of strange attractors using only a small number of initial conditions (typically less than 100). Furthermore, we demonstrate how the dynamical discrete web can also be used to identify unstable periodic orbits embedded in the strange attractor."}
{"text":"We study the interaction between two open strings with opposite spins and show that it is described by an effective action which contains higher derivative terms, as well as nonlocal interactions. We also discuss how this result can be extended to closed strings. The results are obtained using the light-cone gauge formulation for string theory on AdS5xS5 backgrounds. In particular we consider the case where one of the strings has spin zero while the other has spin one-half. This corresponds to studying the scattering amplitude involving four gluons at strong coupling. Our analysis shows that there exist new contributions to the S-matrix elements coming from the exchange of massive states corresponding to Kaluza-Klein excitations of the supergravity fields. These effects cannot be captured within perturbation theory but they become important when the energy scale becomes large compared to the inverse radius of curvature of the space-time geometry. Finally, we comment on possible extensions of our work beyond the leading order approximation."}
{"text":"The article is devoted to studying the influence of impurities on the properties of crystals with defects and dislocations, which are formed under conditions of high pressure. The results obtained by computer simulation show that the presence of impurity atoms leads to an increase in the number of local deformations (dislocation loops) near them. In addition, it was found that the introduction of impurities into the crystal lattice causes the appearance of new types of collective excitations - gyration-like ones. It has been shown that these excitations can be considered as a result of interaction between dislocation lines and impurity atoms. The effect of impurities on the energy spectrum of phonons in crystals containing defects and dislocations has also been studied. The results of calculations have shown that the presence of impurities leads to changes in the phonon density of states at low frequencies. This fact indicates that the impurities affect not only the structure but also the dynamics of the system."}
{"text":"The cosmic ray origin is still unknown, but it may be related to the supernova explosion.  The propagation model describes how cosmic rays are transported in space by diffusion processes with energy losses due to ionization and Coulomb scattering off interstellar gas particles.   This article presents an overview on cosmic ray physics and introduces some basic concepts for understanding cosmic ray transport models. Cosmic rays have been observed since the 19th century. They consist mainly of protons (about 85%) and helium nuclei (about 14%). Their energies range up to 10^20 eV. However, their sources remain unclear. It has been suggested that they might come from exploded stars called supernovae or from active galactic nuclei such as quasars. In this case, they would travel through intergalactic space before reaching Earth. Another possibility is that they are accelerated within our own galaxy. If so, then they could reach us directly without traveling far away."}
{"text":"We have studied in detail how to correct for various observational effects on the determination of the white dwarf luminosity function (WDLF). We find that the WDLF is affected by several factors, such as photometric calibration error, incompleteness due to detection limit, contamination by unresolved binaries, etc.. In order to obtain an unbiased estimate of the true WDLF we need to take into account these effects properly.  By using Monte Carlo simulations with artificial data sets, we show that our method can recover the input WDLF very well even when there are large uncertainties in the observed magnitudes or colors. Our results also suggest that it may be difficult to determine the absolute normalization of the WDLF accurately because of systematic uncertainty associated with the distance scale. Finally, we apply this method to the recent observations made by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 1 (DR1), which covers about one quarter of the sky."}
{"text":"We study the spherically symmetric solutions to modified gravitational field equations with an arbitrary function of Ricci scalar, f (R). We show that there are two classes of exact solutions for this theory depending on whether or not the trace of energy-momentum tensor vanishes identically. In the first class we find new black hole and wormhole solutions which have no counterparts in Einstein's general relativity. The second class contains only vacuum solutions. For both cases we derive the corresponding effective potentials and discuss their properties. Finally, we present some examples of these solutions.

However, it has been shown recently that quantum effects may lead to modifications of classical gravity [2] , so that the standard model should be extended beyond its current form [3] .\nIn order to investigate such extensions, several authors [4] - [8] have studied different aspects of modified gravitational field equations with various functions of Ricci scalar R as follows,\nwhere T \u00b5\u03bd denotes the energy-momentum tensor of matter fields. It was found that many interesting features appear when the above equation is solved numerically [9] - [11] . On the other hand, analytical studies reveal that the most important feature of these models is the existence of singularities [12] - [14] . This fact makes them unsuitable candidates for describing realistic physical phenomena. Therefore, it seems necessary to consider more complicated forms of f (R), e.g., those containing higher-order derivatives [15] - [17] ."}
{"text":"We study the global structure of solutions to the nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation in Minkowski space-time, $$\\partial_\\mu \\phi \\partial^\\mu \\phi - V(\\phi) = 0$$ where $\\phi$ is a real-valued function on $\\mathbb{R}^4$ and $V(\\phi)=e^{-\\phi}$.  We show that there exists an explicit formula for all globally defined smooth solutions which are spherically symmetric about some point $O\\in \\mathbb{R}^4$; these solutions can be written as $$\\phi(x) = f(r), \\quad r^2=x_0^2+\\dots+x_3^2$$  Here $f$ is any smooth function satisfying $f'(0)=f''(0)=0$.   The corresponding energy density satisfies the inequality $$\\rho_{max} \\le \\frac{3}{4}\\rho_{min}$$   In particular, this implies that if we consider only those solutions whose energy density attains its maximum value somewhere inside the ball $B_R(O)$ then such solutions must have finite total mass (and hence finite ADM-mass).   This result generalizes previous results by Eardley et al., who showed that the same holds true when one considers only those solutions whose energy densities attain their maxima on the boundary of the ball $B_R(0)$.    Finally, we discuss how our results may be used to construct new examples of black holes in higher dimensions."}
{"text":"The hole spectra characteristics are investigated for the superlattices (SLs) with different aluminum contents by using first-principles calculations based on density functional theory. The results show that the valence band maximum is located at \u0393 point, while conduction band minimum locates at M point. With increasing x value, the energy gap decreases gradually due to the increase of electronegativity difference between GaN and AlN layers. In addition, we find that there exists an obvious charge polarization effect in SLs which leads to the formation of electric field inside the SLs. This electric field causes the splitting of heavy-hole subband into two parts near Fermi level. Furthermore, it can be seen clearly that the split-off bands move towards lower energies as x increases. Finally, the calculated effective masses of holes decrease slightly when x changes from 0.25 to 1.0. \n \n Keywords: AlGaInN\/GaN superlattice; Charge polarization"}

{"text":"We report on neutron scattering experiments performed to study magnetic excitations in an underdoped cuprate superconductor, YBa2Cu3Ox (x = 6.35). We observe that the intensity and linewidth of the low-energy spin waves decrease with increasing temperature up to T* ~ 150 K, which is higher than Tc by about 50 K. The observed behavior can be explained within the framework of the spin-fermion model if one assumes that the spin-wave lifetime decreases rapidly at temperatures close to T* due to the decay into fermionic quasiparticles. This interpretation implies that the pseudogap opens already below T* as suggested previously. \n \n Introduction \n \n In recent years there has been considerable interest in studying the properties of high-temperature superconductors using neutron scattering techniques [1-5]. Neutron scattering allows us not only to investigate the static structure factor S(Q) but also dynamic correlations such as phonons or magnons [6]. It was found recently [7-9] that the low energy spin wave spectrum in optimally doped YBa2Cu3O3 displays unusual features compared to conventional metals. For example, it exhibits a strong dispersion anisotropy along different crystallographic directions [8] and shows significant deviations from the usual linear dependence between the inverse spin wave velocity and momentum [9]. These results have stimulated theoretical studies [10-12] aimed at understanding how these unconventional spin wave properties are related to the electronic structure of the CuO2 planes. However, little attention has so far been paid to the effect of doping on the spin wave dynamics. Here we present new experimental data obtained on an underdoped sample of YBa2Cu3OX (x= 6.35), where x denotes the oxygen content [13]. Our main goal is to explore whether the spin wave properties change significantly when going away from optimal doping towards lower values of x."}
{"text":"We study the relativistic stabilization of the diocotron mode by using an exact solution for the electromagnetic field inside and outside a cylindrical magnetized plasma shell with finite conductivity, which is rotating around its axis at angular velocity $\\Omega$ .

We show that the diocotron instability can be suppressed if the following condition is satisfied: \n$$\\frac{1}{\\mu_0}\\frac{\\partial B}{\\partial r}(r=R)>\\Omega R^2$$\n, where $R$ is the radius of the cylinder and $B$ is the azimuthal component of the magnetic field on the surface of the cylinder.

It turns out that this new mode becomes dominant when the above mentioned stability criterion is violated."}

We find evidence for two distinct scattering regions along our line-of-sight to this object; one is associated with the brightest part of the nebula, while another region shows lower polarization degrees but higher polarized fluxes at longer wavelengths. These results suggest that there may be multiple sources contributing to the observed emission. In addition, we detect several absorption features which can be attributed to water ice on dust grains near the central star(s).

{"text":"We study the effect of disorder on the electronic structure in Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+\u03b4 (Bi-2212) by using the t-matrix approximation with realistic parameters for the impurity scattering potential. We find that, even at low temperatures where the system is expected to be fully gapped, there are still states inside the gap which can lead to an enhanced density of states near the Fermi level. This result suggests that the pseudogap may not be due solely to pairing correlations but also has contributions from other effects such as disorder or magnetic fluctuations. The results presented here provide further evidence against the existence of a true energy gap in this material. \n \n Introduction: In recent years, much attention has been paid to the phenomenon known as \"pseudogap\" observed in high-Tc cuprates [1] . It refers to the suppression of the density of states around the Fermi surface below T* ~ 150 K [2] , which cannot be explained within BCS theory [3] . Pseudogap behavior was first discovered in angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy experiments [4] , and later confirmed by scanning tunneling microscopy [5] .\nIn order to explain these experimental observations, several theoretical models have been proposed [6] - [8] . However, it remains unclear whether the pseudogap originates from pairing correlations [9] , antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations [10] , charge ordering [11] , or some combination of all three [12] ."}
{"text":"We show that the Pioneer anomaly, which is an anomalous acceleration observed in radio tracking data for two spacecrafts launched by NASA (Pioneer 10\/11), can be explained if we assume that there exists a conformal symmetry breaking effect at large distances from our solar system. We also argue that this effect may lead to accelerating expansion of the universe. The idea behind these results is based on the fact that the space-time metric around massive bodies has been shown to have a certain degree of anisotropy due to quantum gravity effects. This anisotropic nature of space-time leads to violation of Lorentz invariance, which in turn causes violations of energy-momentum conservation laws. In order to explain such violations within the framework of general relativity one needs to introduce new fields into the theory. These are called \"dark fields\" because they do not interact with ordinary matter but only affect gravitational interactions between particles."}
{"text":"We present new near-infrared (NIR) polarimetric observations of the GG Tau system, which reveal that its circumstellar disk is highly structured and contains several bright regions with different polarization properties. The most prominent feature in our data set is an arc-like structure located at about 0.5 arcsec to the south-east of the central binary star. This region shows strong polarized emission up to 10% of the total intensity and has been previously identified as a reflection nebula by Weintraub et al. (1993) . We find that this feature can be explained by scattering off optically thin dust grains close to the midplane of the disk. In addition we detect two other bright features on either side of the central binary. These are also associated with high degrees of linear polarization but show no clear evidence for scattered light. Instead they appear to be caused by absorption against the background stellar flux. Finally, we identify three additional fainter structures in the southern part of the disk. All these features have similar polarization angles indicating that their origin may be related."}
{"text":"We study droplet excitations in the 2D spin-glass model with nearest-neighbor interactions and random ferromagnetic bonds, which is known to have an infinite number of metastable states at zero temperature. We show that this system has two different types of droplets: small ones are similar to those found in other models studied previously; large droplets are characterized by their fractal structure. The latter type can be viewed as a generalization of the droplet picture proposed earlier for the 3D Ising spin glasses. In addition we find that there exists another class of excitations -the so-called \"giant droplets\"-which are not present in any of these systems. These giant droplets are responsible for the non-universal behavior observed numerically near the critical point. Finally, we argue that our results provide strong numerical support for the existence of a new phase transition line between the paramagnetic state and the spin-glass one. \nI. INTRODUCTORY REMARK\nThe concept of \"droplet excitations\" was introduced originally within the framework of the mean-field theory [1] . It describes how local perturbations affect global properties of the system. This idea turned out to be very useful when applied to various disordered systems such as spin glasses [2] , structural glasses [3] or vortex lattices [4] .\nIn particular it allowed to explain many features of the low-temperature thermodynamics of spin glasses [5] . However, despite its successes, the original droplet picture suffers from some serious drawbacks [6] : first, it does not take into account fluctuations around the saddle-point solution [7]; secondly, it predicts a finite density of droplets even at T = 0 [8] ; thirdly, it cannot describe properly the dynamics of the system [9] . To overcome these difficulties several modifications were suggested [10] . One of them [11] leads to the following expression for the free energy F(T ) per site: \nwhere f0 is the free-energy density of the reference system (e.g., the pure ferromagnet), Ns is the total number of spins, V is the volume occupied by each droplet"}

{"text":"The production of particles with large transverse momenta is studied in the fragmentation region for gluons and quarks produced by photons, Z bosons or W bosons.  The data are taken using the D0 detector operating at Fermilab's Tevatron Collider. Events containing jets that have high transverse momentum (pT) and low pseudorapidity () are selected to study particle production in quark and gluon fragmentation regions. In addition, events where one jet has pT>20GeV\/c and another jet has pT>15GeV\/c are used to compare the properties of these two types of jets. The results show that the fraction of charged hadrons increases as the number of constituent quarks decreases. This behavior can be explained by the fact that the probability of producing a strange quark is higher than that of producing an up or down quark. The mean multiplicity of neutral mesons also shows this trend but not as clearly as the charged hadron multiplicity does."}

{"text":"We consider the problem of broadcasting in wireless networks with random access, where nodes can transmit at any time they choose to do so. We propose an algorithm that achieves stability by using a simple backoff mechanism based on local information only. The proposed scheme is shown to be throughput optimal under certain conditions. In addition, we show how our results are related to existing work on this topic. Finally, simulation experiments demonstrate the performance gains achieved by our approach over other schemes. Wireless broadcast has been studied extensively for many years due to its wide range of applications such as data dissemination, file transfer, video streaming, etc.. However, most previous works assume that all transmissions occur synchronously or within some fixed schedule. This assumption does not hold true when there exist multiple transmitters competing for channel resources simultaneously. Random access (RA) protocols have recently received much attention because they allow users to send packets whenever it is convenient without requiring tight synchronization among them [1] . Unfortunately, RA introduces additional challenges compared to traditional synchronous transmission models since collisions may happen frequently if no coordination exists between different transmitters [2] .\nIn this paper, we study the problem of broadcasting in multi-hop wireless networks with random access. Specifically, each node maintains one packet which needs to be transmitted to every other node in the network eventually. Each node chooses independently and uniformly at random a starting time slot to begin transmitting its packet. If two or more nodes start their transmissions at the same time slot, then these transmissions collide and none of them will reach the intended receivers successfully. Our goal is to design distributed algorithms that achieve both stability and high throughput while minimizing the number of retransmissions required to deliver messages reliably."}
{"text":"We present new near-infrared (NIR) observations of the supernova remnant (SNR) 3C58, which show that its central star is surrounded by an extended shell-like structure with a radius of ~0.5 pc and mass loss rate of ~10-5 Msun\/yr. The NIR emission shows no evidence for dust formation or shock heating at this location; instead it appears to be dominated by line emission from ionized gas. We argue that these results are consistent with the presence of a pre-supernova wind driven by the progenitor star prior to its explosion as a Type II-P supernova about 3000 years ago. This interpretation implies that the progenitor was a red supergiant with initial mass between 8-15 solar masses. If so, then our results provide direct observational support for theoretical models of massive stellar evolution. In addition, we find that the observed properties of the circumstellar material surrounding the progenitor can account for most of the unusual characteristics of the radio spectrum of 3C58."}
{"text":"We study the evolution and final fate of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in galactic nuclei, focusing on their growth via capturing stars with high orbital angular momenta. We find that SMBHs can grow to masses above 10^10 M_sun if they are surrounded by an extended self-gravitating accretion disk which is able to efficiently transport angular momentum outward. The mass inflow rate onto the central BH increases significantly when it captures a star with large orbital angular momentum. This leads to rapid growth of the BH accompanied by strong outflows driven by radiation pressure or magnetic fields. Our results suggest that such processes may be responsible for the formation of ultramassive black holes at z>6. \n \n Keywords: Black hole - Growth - Self-gravity - Accretion disks - Stellar dynamics \n \n Supermassive black holes (SBHs), with masses ranging between $10^{7}$-$10^{10}M_{\\odot}$, reside in the centers of most galaxies. They have been growing continuously since their births through gas accretion and\/or mergers with other SBHs. However, how these SBHs grew so rapidly remains unclear. In this work we show that SBHs can grow very quickly due to efficient angular-momentum transfer caused by gravitational torques exerted by surrounding self-gravitating accretion discs. These discs form as a result of tidal disruption of captured stars with high orbital angular momentum. As a consequence, the mass inflow rates increase dramatically after each encounter with a high-angular-momentum star, leading to rapid growth of the SBH. Strong outflows driven by radiation or magnetic pressure accompany the rapid growth of the SBH\""}
{"text":"The recent debate on the future availability of fossil fuels has focused attention on the possible implications of peak oil (the maximum rate at which economically viable quantities can be extracted) for global warming, particularly in relation to the Kyoto Protocol's emissions targets.  In this study we use an integrated assessment model that includes both economic growth and energy supply\/demand dynamics to examine how different assumptions about the timing and magnitude of peak oil affect projected levels of carbon dioxide (CO2), temperature change and sea-level rise by 2100 under business-as-usual conditions.   We find that if peak oil occurs before 2020 then it will have little effect on these variables because there is still time available to develop alternative sources of energy. However, if peak oil does occur after 2020 but before 2030 then its effects are more significant; depending upon the exact date and magnitude of peak oil, our results suggest that temperatures could increase between 1.5\u00b0C and 3.0\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels by 2100 with associated increases in sea level rise ranging up to 0.7 metres."}
{"text":"We study the nonlinear evolution of baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) in an expanding universe using numerical simulations with N-body particles and hydrodynamic gas dynamics. We find that BAOs are suppressed by nonlinear gravitational clustering, but they can be recovered by applying a Wiener filter to the density field at each redshift. The reconstructed power spectrum agrees well with linear theory predictions on large scales where the effect is negligible. On small scales, however, we observe significant deviations between the two spectra due to nonlinear effects such as shell crossing and virialization. These results suggest that it may be possible to use BAOs as standard rulers for cosmological distance measurements even when the underlying matter distribution becomes highly nonlinear. In this work, we present our main findings below. \n1 Introduction\n\nBaryons play important roles in galaxy formation through their interactions with dark matter. For example, observations show that galaxies form around peaks of the primordial density fluctuations which grow into massive halos via gravitational instability. Therefore, understanding how baryons evolve in time and space is crucial for studying galaxy formation processes.\n\nIn recent years, there has been growing interest in measuring the large-scale structure of the Universe using baryonic tracers like neutral hydrogen or stars. One promising method involves tracing the spatial distribution of these objects back in time using spectroscopic surveys. This technique allows us to measure the statistical properties of the cosmic web, including its geometry and topology, over a wide range of redshifts. \n\nThe most prominent feature observed in the measured correlation functions of various types of baryonic tracers is known as \"baryonic acoustic oscillation\" (BAO). It refers to periodic wiggles seen in the power spectrum of the tracer population caused by sound waves propagating through the early universe before decoupling [see e.g., 1] . Since the amplitude of the BAO signal depends only weakly on the physical state of the medium, it provides a robust way to probe the expansion history of the universe independent of other cosmological parameters [2] .\nRecently, several groups have reported detections of the BAO signature in the correlation function of Lyman"}
{"text":"The concept of tensegrity is used to describe the structural behavior of many biological systems, such as muscles and tendons.  In this work we explore how continuous tensegrities can be generated by using an evolutionary algorithm that optimizes their performance in terms of compliance with external loads while maintaining stability under gravity loading conditions.   The results show that it is possible to generate stable structures that are able to resist large deformations without collapsing or losing their integrity. This research has been funded by the European Commission through the Marie Curie Initial Training Network (ITN) program. The concept of tensegrity was first introduced by Buckminster Fuller more than 60 years ago [1] . It describes the structural behavior of many natural systems like muscles [2] , tendons [3] , bones [4] , and even living organisms [5] .\nIn recent decades there have been several attempts at applying the concept of tensegrity to engineering applications [6] - [8] . However, most of these works focus on discrete tensegrities which consist of rigid bars connected together by elastic struts [9] . These types of structures cannot easily adapt to changes in their environment since they do not allow for any deformation [10] . On the other hand, continuous tensegrities [11] are capable of changing shape continuously when subjected to external forces [12] . They also exhibit higher levels of robustness against damage [13] compared to conventional materials [14] . Despite all these advantages, very little attention has been paid so far to the design of continuous tensegrities [15] .\nThis lack of interest may be due to the fact that designing continuous tensegrities requires solving highly nonlinear optimization problems [16] . Moreover, finding solutions to these problems is extremely challenging because of the high number of local optima [17] . To overcome these difficulties, researchers usually use heuristic search algorithms [18] - [20] instead of exact methods [21] ."}
{"text":"We present an approach to the analysis and design of stochastic gene regulatory networks based on deterministic models that are derived by averaging over all possible realizations of the underlying random process.  We show how this method can be used for analyzing the steady-state behavior of such systems, as well as their transient dynamics in response to external stimuli or changes in network parameters. The proposed framework is illustrated with several examples including synthetic toggle switches and oscillators. Stochasticity plays an important role in many biological processes ranging from cell cycle regulation to signal transduction [1] . In particular, it has been shown that noise may have beneficial effects on cellular functions [2] , e.g., by enhancing the sensitivity of cells to signals [3] .\nThe study of stochastic gene regulatory networks (GRNs) requires the development of new mathematical tools capable of capturing both the intrinsic fluctuations associated with molecular interactions and extrinsic perturbations due to environmental factors [4] . Several approaches have recently been developed to analyze GRNs; these include Monte Carlo simulations [5] , moment-closure methods [6] , and approximate analytical techniques [7, 8] . However, most existing methods focus only on the stationary properties of GRNs [9] ; they cannot capture the dynamic evolution of the system when its state variables change continuously [10] . Moreover, some of them require extensive computational resources [11] and\/or do not provide any information about the statistical distribution of the output variable(s).\nIn this work we propose a novel methodology for studying the dynamical behavior of GRNs using deterministic models obtained through ensemble averages [12] . This approach allows us to obtain accurate approximations of the mean value and variance of the output variable(ies), while preserving the main characteristics of the original model [13] .

We propose a novel cascade model that captures the fact that people are more likely to read posts by their friends than random posts. Our main contributions are: (1) we develop efficient algorithms for computing the cascade size distribution under our model; (2) we show how to use these results to estimate the number of active users at any given time during a cascade; (3) we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using data collected from LiveJournal.com. The Web has become one of the most important communication channels today. In particular, social networks such as Facebook or Twitter have attracted millions of users who share information with others through online messages known as tweets or status updates. These messages can be seen by all followers of the user posting them, which may cause further propagation of the message within the network. This phenomenon is called viral marketing [1] , and it has been studied extensively over recent years [2] . However, despite its importance, there still remain many open questions about the dynamics of this process [3] .\nIn this work, we focus on studying cascades on large blogging communities, where each node represents an individual blogger and edges connect pairs of blogs written by the same person [4] . A cascade starts when some blogger writes a post containing a URL pointing to another blog's page. Then, if her readers click on the link, they will visit the other blog and possibly continue reading additional posts. As shown in Figure 1 , the resulting graph contains several connected components representing different topics discussed by the community members."}
{"text":"In this article, we study the equivariant cohomology groups of twisted generalized complex manifolds with respect to compact Lie group actions. We show that these equivariant cohomology groups are isomorphic to those of ordinary generalized complex manifolds equipped with an invariant Hermitian metric and a compatible connection whose torsion is equal to the twisting form. As applications, we compute some examples in detail. In particular, for any closed oriented Riemann surface M , we give explicit formulas for all equivariant Betti numbers of the moduli space of stable vector bundles over M . \nIntroduction\n\nLet G be a compact connected Lie group acting on a smooth manifold X. The equivariant cohomology H*G(X) was introduced by Atiyah-Bott [1] as the cohomology ring of the Borel construction EG\u00d7_G X where EG denotes the universal bundle over BG = K(G, 1). It has been studied extensively since then (see e.g., [2] ). For example, if X is a symplectic manifold acted upon by a torus T, then H*G(X), which can also be viewed as the equivariant cohomology of the corresponding Hamiltonian T-space, plays an important role in mirror symmetry [3] .\nThe notion of generalized complex geometry [4] provides us with another class of interesting geometric objects -the so-called generalized complex manifolds-which include both symplectic and complex manifolds as special cases. Generalized complex structures were first defined by Hitchin [5] using Courant algebroids [6] . Later Gualtieri [7] gave a more intrinsic definition via a pair of almost complex structures satisfying certain compatibility conditions. Recently, it was shown [8] that there exists a one-to-one correspondence between generalized complex structures and pairs consisting of a holomorphic Poisson structure and its associated Nijenhuis tensor field. This result allows us to define generalized complex structures intrinsically without referring to Courant algebroids; see [9] for details. \nGeneralized complex manifolds have attracted much attention recently due to their close connections with string theories [10] . Moreover, they provide new insights into many classical problems such as integr"}
{"text":"We present new near-infrared integral field spectroscopy observations of two nearby active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with compact nuclear star formation, NGC 1068 and Mrk 3. The data were obtained using SINFONI at VLT\/UT4. We find that both AGNs have very high infrared luminosities (LIR ~10^11 Lsun), which are dominated by emission lines originating from warm molecular gas excited by young stars. In addition to these bright line features we detect spatially extended continuum emission on scales of several hundred parsecs around each nucleus. This is likely due to dust heated by the intense radiation fields produced by the AGN and\/or hot young stars. Our results show that the presence of an AGN does not necessarily prevent massive star formation within its host galaxy. These findings suggest that there may be a close link between black hole growth and nuclear star formation activity.  Keywords: Active Galactic Nuclei"}
{"text":"We present new results on the distribution and kinematics of neutral hydrogen (HI) gas in the Large Magellanic:  We use data cubes obtained with the Australia Telescope Compact Array to study the large-scale structure of the LMC's HI disk, including its warp.  The HI emission is found to be concentrated into two main components separated by ~10 kpc along the major axis of the galaxy.  These are identified as the northern and southern halves of an extended HI ring surrounding the optical body of the galaxy.  This ring has a radius of ~20 kpc at a position angle of ~45 degrees east of north.   A comparison between our observations and previous work suggests that this ring may have been produced by tidal interactions between the LMC and SMC during their recent encounter about 1 Gyr ago.  In addition we find evidence for several smaller-scale structures within the ring which appear to trace out a spiral pattern.  Finally, we detect faint diffuse emission extending beyond the edge of the ring towards the south-east corner of the galaxy.  This emission appears to form part of another large ring-like feature located just outside the outer boundary of the LMC's stellar disk."}

{"text":"A mathematical model is developed to study the endogenous and exogenous dynamics associated with pressure fluctuations within an entrained flow gasifier, which are caused by the interaction between fluid mechanics and chemical reactions. The proposed model consists of two parts: one for describing the hydrodynamics inside the gasifier; another for representing the thermochemical processes occurring at different locations along the reactor axis. In order to investigate how these interactions affect the system stability, we perform linear analysis on both parts separately as well as their combined effect. It is found that the thermochemical process can be stabilized if the residence time of particles in the reaction zone is sufficiently large. However, this may not always be possible due to practical constraints such as high temperature requirement or limited space available. Finally, numerical simulations are performed using realistic operating conditions to verify our theoretical results. Pressure fluctuations have been observed experimentally in many types of gasifiers including bubbling bed, circulating fluidized bed (CFB), and entrained flow gasifiers [1] . These fluctuations often lead to unstable operation of the gasification systems [2] , resulting in poor quality syngas production [3] .\nThe main cause of pressure fluctuation lies in the coupling between fluid mechanics and chemical kinetics [4] . For example, when the fuel feed rate increases suddenly, more reactants enter into the reaction zone causing higher temperatures there. This leads to faster chemical reactions and thus larger heat release rates. As a result, the local pressure rises rapidly. On the other hand, when the fuel feed decreases quickly, less reactants enter into the combustion chamber leading to lower temperatures and slower chemical reactions. Consequently, the local pressure drops sharply."}

The sample is divided into two groups according to morphological type (Sa-Sab and Sb-Scd), each containing 12 objects. We find that both samples have similar mean ages but different metallicities; Sa-Sab spirals show solar or super-solar metallicity while Sb-Scd spirals tend to be sub-solar in abundance. This difference can be explained by assuming that the former group has experienced more recent star formation than the latter one. In addition we find evidence for radial age gradients within individual galaxies, where younger stars are found towards larger galactocentric radii. Finally, we compare our results with those obtained using photometric data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey."}
{"text":"In this work, we propose a novel cross-layer scheme to improve the performance of distributed wireless ad hoc networks (DWAHNs). The proposed scheme is based on an adaptive routing protocol and a dynamic channel allocation algorithm. In particular, our approach uses a new metric called \"expected transmission count\" in order to select routes with minimum expected number of transmissions per packet delivery. Furthermore, it employs a modified version of the well-known proportional fairness criterion as well as a utility function that takes into account both the current network conditions and user preferences. Finally, the proposed scheme also incorporates a mechanism which allows nodes to dynamically change their operating channels according to the traffic load at each node. Extensive simulation experiments are conducted using NS-2 simulator to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme under different scenarios. Results show that the proposed scheme outperforms existing approaches by achieving higher throughput while maintaining low end-to-end delay and packet loss rate."}

NoCs are expected to be the dominant communication infrastructure in future multi-core and many-core processors, which will require high bandwidth and low latency communications between cores. However, traditional electrical NoCs suffer from power consumption issues due to their limited scalability with increasing core count. In this work we propose a novel bio-inspired optical NoC architecture that can provide higher bandwidth at lower energy cost than conventional electrical NoCs. The proposed NoC consists of two main components; photonic routers and optoelectronic transceivers. Photonic routers use silicon photonics technology to route data packets through multiple channels simultaneously using wavelength division multiplexing technique. Optoelectronic transceiver uses vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser diodes as transmitters and avalanche photo-diode detectors as receivers. We have developed a detailed simulation model based on SystemC to evaluate performance characteristics such as packet delay, throughput and power dissipation of our proposed NoC design.

{"text":"We present the theory for two-photon interactions in broadband down-converted light, including entanglement between photons generated by spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC). We show that this leads to new effects such as photon bunching at zero time delay and antibunching at nonzero delays. These results are compared against experimental data obtained using SPDC sources based on periodically poled lithium niobate waveguides. The theoretical model is also used to predict the effect of varying pump bandwidths and crystal lengths on the degree of second-order coherence g(2)(0) measured experimentally. This work was supported by EPSRC grant EP\/G037656\/1. \n \n In recent years there has been growing interest in quantum optics experiments involving broadband down-conversion [1\u20133].

However, many aspects of these experiments remain poorly understood due to difficulties associated with modelling the complicated nonlinear processes involved [9, 10]. Here we develop an analytical description of two-photon interactions in broad-band down-converted light which includes both temporal and spatial degrees of freedom [11, 12]. Our approach allows us to calculate the joint spectral intensity distribution of the down-converted field [13], which can then be used to determine the probability density function describing the arrival times of pairs of photons produced via spontaneous parametric downconversion [14\u201318]. As well as providing insight into the physics underlying broadband down-conversion experiments, our analysis enables quantitative predictions about the behaviour of such systems to be made."}

{"text":"We study how classical and quantum uncertainty affect the price dynamics in an incomplete information setting, where agents have access to different sources of information about the underlying state variable. We show that when there is no common knowledge among traders on the true value of the state variable, they may disagree on its expected future evolution even if all are rational and risk-neutral. This disagreement leads to fluctuations in prices which can be amplified by the presence of noise traders who trade based solely on their private signals. In this case, we find that the stock returns exhibit volatility clustering and fat tails similar to those observed empirically. Finally, we demonstrate that these effects persist for both classical and quantum states with non-Gaussian statistics. The results presented here provide new insights into the role played by uncertainty in shaping the statistical properties of asset returns.

{"text":"We present the first complete analysis of extra dimensions in which all fields are allowed to propagate into the bulk. We show that this leads naturally to an effective four-dimensional theory with non-renormalizable interactions suppressed by powers of the fundamental scale M . The resulting low-energy physics is described by a renormalizable field theory containing only standard model particles plus additional scalar degrees of freedom. In particular we find that the Higgs boson can be identified as one such degree of freedom. This scenario provides a simple explanation for why the Higgs mass parameter has not been observed at LEP or LHC experiments so far. It also offers new ways to search for these scalars experimentally. Introduction: One of the most important open questions in particle physics concerns the origin of electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB). A particularly attractive possibility is provided by theories where EWSB occurs dynamically through strong gauge dynamics [1] , leading to composite Higgs models [2] . However, it remains unclear how to reconcile such scenarios with precision measurements [3] .\nIn recent years there have been several attempts [4] - [8] to construct realistic models based on extra spatial dimensions [9] . These approaches typically involve compactification of higher dimensional space-times down to 4D Minkowski spacetime [10] . While this approach allows for interesting phenomenological consequences [11] , it suffers from two major drawbacks: First, the presence of Kaluza-Klein towers of states [12] makes the theory nonrenormalizable [13] . Second, the size R of the extra dimension(s) must be stabilized [14] against radiative corrections [15] . Both problems may be overcome if the Standard Model (SM) fields are allowed to propagate freely into the bulk [16] . Indeed, in [17] it was shown that the SM fermions acquire their masses via Yukawa couplings localized on the brane while the Higgs boson arises as a bound state of the strongly interacting sector living in the bulk [18] . Moreover, the large number of KaluzaKlein modes decouple automatically due to the exponential suppression factor e \u2212M\u03c0R [19] .

In addition to being important probes of the physical conditions within the absorbing gas itself, BALQSOs also provide information regarding the properties of the surrounding intergalactic medium through studies of the associated metal-line systems (e.g., Weymann et al., 1979; Foltz et al., 1986; Turnshek & Savage 1988; Hamann 1998a ,b, 1999 . However, despite their importance as cosmological tools, there has been little progress made in understanding these objects since the discovery of their first examples more than 30 years ago due primarily to selection effects inherent in optical surveys (see e.g., Hewett & Foltz 2003 ) . \n \n Recently, several authors have suggested that many BALQSOs could be found among infrared-selected sources using large-area near-infrared sky surveys such as the Two-Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS) (Cutri et"}
{"text":"We consider the controllability properties for linearized models of mechanical systems evolving on Lie groups, with particular emphasis on the case where the configuration space is the group of rigid motions in three dimensions. We show that these systems are not locally controllable around any equilibrium point unless they have an additional symmetry which we call ``isotropy''. This result has important consequences for the study of ideal fluid flows governed by Euler's equations. In fact, it implies that such flows cannot be controlled at all if their initial conditions belong to certain invariant sets (the so-called vortex cores). The results presented here were obtained during my PhD thesis under the supervision of Prof. Miroslav Krstic at ETH Zurich. I would like to thank him as well as Dr. David J. Simoes for many useful discussions about this work. Controllability problems arise naturally when one considers optimal control or feedback stabilization questions for dynamical systems. For example, given some desired state trajectory $x_d(t)$, one may ask whether there exists a control input $u(t)$ steering the system from its current state $x$ towards the target trajectory $x_d(t), \\forall t\\in [0,T]$ within finite time $T$. \n \n In general, the answer to this question depends strongly on the choice of the cost functional used to measure the distance between trajectories. However, if one restricts attention to quadratic costs, then the problem becomes much more tractable since it can be formulated as a convex optimization program over the set of admissible controls. Moreover, if the dynamics evolve on a vector space, then the solution to this problem always exists; see e.g., [1] . Unfortunately, things become considerably more complicated if the underlying state space is a manifold instead; see [2] , [3, Chapter 4] \n \n [4]-[6] . Indeed, even though the problem remains convex whenever the cost function is quadratic, the existence of solutions no longer follows automatically [7]; see also [8] - [10] . \n \n In recent years, several authors have studied the controllability properties of various classes of nonlinear systems evolving on manifolds using"}

{"text":"We study the wetting properties of a fluid in contact with an attractive wall, using a simple model for which we can perform exact calculations. The system consists of particles interacting via a hard-core repulsion and a short-range attraction that decays exponentially fast at large distances. We show how to calculate exactly the density profile near the wall as well as the surface tension between the liquid phase and the gas phase. In particular, we find that there is no true equilibrium state corresponding to complete wetting by the liquid phase; instead, the interface becomes rough when the temperature decreases below some critical value T*. This phenomenon occurs because the exponential tail of the interaction potential leads to strong fluctuations in the number of particles adsorbed onto the wall. These fluctuations are responsible for the non-analytic behavior observed both in the density profile and in the surface tension. \n \n Introduction \n \n Wetting phenomena occur whenever two phases coexist in contact with each other [1] . For example, water droplets spread over glass surfaces due to capillary forces [2] , while oil spreads out on top of water [3] . A particularly interesting situation arises if one of these phases has a lower dimensionality than the others [4] . Indeed, this may lead to new types of transitions such as those occurring in systems where a thin film coexists with its vapor [5] or in confined geometries [6] . \n \n Here we consider a simple model describing the wetting properties of fluids in contact with walls [7, 8] . Our results suggest that even though the interactions decay rapidly away from the wall, they still give rise to nontrivial effects. More specifically, our analysis shows that the presence of a wall induces strong fluctuations in the number Nw of particles adsorbed on it [9] . As a result, the interface separating the liquid phase (containing all particles) from the gas phase (containing none) becomes rough [10] when the temperature drops below a certain threshold T*. Below T*, the average distance between neighboring particles increases significantly so that the interface acquires a fractal structure [11] . \nModel description\n\nThe system under consideration consists of N identical"}
{"text":"The fossil record is replete with examples of periodic extinction events, but it has been unclear whether these are driven by external factors or internal dynamics within ecosystems. Here we show that biodiversity cycles can be generated solely through interactions between species and their environment without any need to invoke additional mechanisms such as mass extinctions. We use an agent-based model to simulate how communities evolve over time under different environmental conditions. Our results suggest that biodiversity cycles may have played an important role in shaping Earth's biosphere throughout its history. The fossil record contains numerous examples of periodic extinction events (1), which have led some researchers to propose that there must exist underlying periodicity in ecosystem processes (2). However, it remains unknown what causes this apparent regularity in the fossil record; one possibility is that periods of high diversity alternate with intervals during which many species go extinct simultaneously (3) (4) . In addition, it is not clear if all observed patterns of biodiversity cycling represent true cyclical behavior or simply reflect stochastic variation around a mean value (5-7).\nHere we present evidence suggesting that biodiversity cycles can arise spontaneously from ecological interactions alone, without requiring any additional mechanism like mass extinctions. To test our hypothesis, we used an agent-based model to explore how communities evolve over time when subjected to varying levels of environmental stress. This approach allowed us to examine how changes in community composition affect population abundances across multiple trophic levels. By simulating thousands of replicate runs using different parameter values, we were able to identify robust statistical signatures associated with biodiversity cycles."}
{"text":"We show that the problem of approximating Nash equilibria in two-player zero-sum entangled games is NP-hard, even if one restricts attention to pure strategies and exact equilibria.  We also prove an analogous result for mixed-strategy equilibria. These results hold under standard complexity-theoretic assumptions such as P = NP or RP = NEXP. The proof uses a reduction from the maximum cut problem on graphs with bounded treewidth. This shows that finding Nash equilibria exactly (even only among pure strategies) can be intractable when players have correlated information about each other's payoffs. Our results suggest that it may not always be possible to find good solutions by using local search algorithms like best-response dynamics. In this work we study the computational difficulty of computing Nash equilibria in two-person zero-sum games where players' utilities depend on their joint actions but they do not know these actions' outcomes before making decisions. Such games are called entangled because the outcome depends on both players' choices; see Figure 1 ."}
{"text":"We study the supersymmetry breaking patterns for vector multiplets transforming under non-adjoint representations of SO(N). We find that there are two distinct classes of theories, depending on whether or not the representation is real. In particular we show how to construct explicit examples with N = 1 and N = 2 supersymmetries which break all their supersymmetries spontaneously. Theories with adjoint matter fields can be obtained as special cases by taking appropriate limits. This work was supported in part by NSF grant PHY-0456735. Supersymmetry (SUSY) has been an important ingredient in many extensions of the Standard Model since its introduction more than thirty years ago [1] . It provides a natural solution to the hierarchy problem between the weak scale and the Planck scale [2] , while at the same time offering new ways to understand gauge coupling unification [3] .\nIn recent years it has become clear that SUSY must be broken if one wants to make contact with experiment [4] . However, despite much effort over several decades [5] - [8] , no fully satisfactory mechanism for spontaneous SUSY breaking exists yet [9] . One promising approach involves using supergravity [10] - [12] to generate soft terms [13] - [15] which then trigger SUSY breakdown [16] - [18] . Another possibility is to use extra dimensions [19] - [21] where SUSY is broken either explicitly [22] - [24] or spontaneously [25] - [27] via boundary conditions [28] - [30] . A third option is to consider models based on local symmetries [31] - [33] such as gauged [34] - [37] or global [38] - [41] SUSY."}
{"text":"We present the results of our analysis of pulsar data obtained with the LOFAR telescope in the Netherlands, which is part of the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR). The observations were carried out at frequencies between 10 MHz and 120 MHz using the High Band Antenna (HBA) system. We have detected two new types of pulsars - one that emits bursts of radio waves lasting several seconds and another whose pulses are modulated by an additional signal. In addition to these discoveries we also report on the detection of previously unknown phenomena associated with known pulsars. \n \n Pulsars are rapidly rotating neutron stars emitting beams of electromagnetic radiation across the entire visible universe. They can be observed over many decades as they spin down due to their magnetic dipole field losing energy into space. This causes them to slow down gradually until they stop completely after about ten billion years. As well as being extremely stable clocks for measuring time intervals, pulsars provide information about fundamental physics such as gravity, quantum electrodynamics and general relativity."}
{"text":"We present an analysis of the kinematics of satellite galaxies in galaxy clusters, which is aimed at measuring the differences between the distribution functions (DFs) of dark matter particles and those of luminous baryonic components. We use data for 16 galaxy clusters with redshifts ranging from 0.1 to 1.0 obtained by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 6. The DFs are reconstructed using the maximum entropy method under the assumption that they have spherical symmetry. In order to test whether this assumption holds true or not, we compare the results derived assuming spherical symmetry with those obtained without any assumptions on the shape of the DFs. Our main result shows that there exists no significant difference between the DFs of dark matter particles and stars within one virial radius around each cluster center. This suggests that the shapes of the DFs of these two components are similar over a wide range of scales."}
{"text":"We report on scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM\/S) studies of the electronic structure of individual Si donors in silicon dioxide grown by chemical vapor deposition at low temperatures.  The STM images show that the Si atoms are incorporated into molecular structures with an apparent height of 1 nm, which is consistent with previous reports for SiO$_2$ films prepared under similar conditions. We find that these molecules have a characteristic spectroscopic signature consisting of two peaks separated by about 0.5 eV in dI\/dV spectra recorded over them. These features can be explained as resulting from hybridization between the localized states associated with each Si atom within the molecule. In addition to this double-peak feature we observe another peak located around -0.3 V bias voltage, whose origin remains unclear. Finally, we discuss possible mechanisms responsible for the formation of such Si-donor molecules. Scanning probe techniques provide unique insight into the local properties of materials. Herein, we present results obtained using scanning tunneling microscopy\/spectroscopy (STM\/STS), which reveal the electronic structure of individual silicon donors embedded in amorphous silicon dioxide layers deposited onto highly doped p-type silicon substrates.

{"text":"We present the first detection of magnetic fields in classical T Tauri stars (CTTSs) using spectropolarimetric observations obtained with ESPaDOnS at CFHT and Narval at TBL, as well as archival data for some targets. We detect Zeeman signatures in Stokes V profiles of H$\\alpha$ lines in all observed CTTSs except TW Hya. The longitudinal field strengths range between -100 G to +300 G. In addition, we find that the mean unsigned circular polarization is higher than 0.1% in most cases. Our results show that the magnetic properties are similar among different types of CTTSs. However, there seems to be no correlation between the strength of the magnetic field and accretion rate or mass loss rates. This suggests that the origin of the magnetic field may not be related to disk accretion processes.  These findings will help us understand how stellar magnetic fields evolve during pre-main-sequence phase."}
{"text":"We study the failure mechanism in uniaxial compression tests on samples of Fontainebleau sandstones with different initial porosities (from 0 to 20%). We show that, for all tested porosities, the stress-strain curves exhibit three distinct regimes corresponding to: elastic deformation; micro-cracking; and macro-fracturing. The onset of each regime is characterized by an abrupt change in the slope of the curve. In addition, we find that the macroscopic strength decreases as the porosity increases. Finally, we investigate how the fracture surfaces are affected by the porosity. Our results indicate that the average height fluctuations increase with increasing porosity. This suggests that the pore space plays an important role during the crack propagation process. \n \n Keywords: Fracture mechanics, Surface roughness, Porosity, Sandstone, Compression test, Failure mechanism \n \n \n \n 1 Introduction \n \n Rocks are heterogeneous materials made up of grains bonded together by cementing material such as clay or quartz [1] . Due to their complex microstructure, rocks can be considered as disordered media [2] , which makes them particularly interesting systems to study statistical properties at various scales [3] . For example, it has been shown recently [4] that the distribution of local stresses inside a rock sample depends strongly on its internal structure. Moreover, the mechanical behavior of rocks under external loading conditions also exhibits strong statistical features [5] .\n \nIn this work, we focus our attention on the effect of porosity on the mechanical response of rocks subjected to compressive loads [6] . Indeed, porosity is one of the most important parameters controlling the physical properties of rocks [7, 8] . It affects both the elastic moduli [9] and the brittleness [10] of rocks.

{"text":"We present the results of an unbiased survey toward starless cores using the HCN hyperfine transitions at 1.42 GHz and 2.12 GHz with the Nobeyama 45 m telescope to probe inward motions within these objects. We detected emission lines from all targets, except for L1521F (Taurus), which is known as one of the coldest prestellar cores. From our observations we found that the line widths are narrower than those observed by single-dish telescopes. This suggests that there may be unresolved substructure or turbulence on small scales inside the cores. For most sources, the peak intensities of both frequencies agree well with each other; however, for some cases they show significant differences between them. These discrepancies can be explained if the core has a temperature gradient along its radius and\/or if it contains multiple velocity components. Our analysis shows that the kinetic temperatures derived from the two different frequency data sets range from 10 K to 30 K."}

{"text":"The effect of magnetic Reynolds number (Rm), Lundquist number (S) and plasma beta (\u03b2) on the efficiency of MRI-driven turbulence is investigated by means of direct numerical simulations in cylindrical geometry with periodic boundary conditions. The results show that Rm, S and \u03b2 have significant effects on the saturation level of the Maxwell stress tensor as well as the growth rate of the kinetic energy density. In particular, it was found that for fixed values of other parameters, increasing Rm leads to an increase in both the saturation value of the Maxwell stress tensor and the growth rate of the total kinetic energy density.  Increasing S also increases the saturation value of the stress tensor but has no influence on its growth rate. On the contrary, decreasing \u03b2 decreases the saturation value of the tensor while having little or no effect on its growth rate. It should be noted that these trends are observed only when the initial equilibrium state satisfies certain constraints which depend on the dimensionless numbers under consideration."}
{"text":"The background radiation in space is dominated by cosmic rays and their secondary products, such as neutrons and gamma-rays. The most important source of these particles are galactic supernovae which occur at an average rate of one per century. In this work we present results on the background radiation expected to be measured with the pn-CCDs (p-type silicon charge-coupled devices) that will be used in the CERN Axion Solar telescope (CAST). We have simulated the response of CAST's detectors using GEANT4 Monte Carlo simulations. These were then combined with models of the particle fluxes in space to predict the background count rates observed by the cameras. Our predictions show that the background count rate due to cosmic ray interactions should not exceed 0.1 counts s-1 pixel-1 over the entire field-of-view of each camera. This corresponds to less than 1% of the signal expected from axions produced in the Sun's magnetic field."}

In both cases we assume that systematics can be controlled down to percent level accuracy. For each experiment we compute the Fisher matrix associated with the measurement of several relevant observables as functions of the underlying cosmology. The resulting covariance matrices are then used to perform parameter forecasts using Monte Carlo Markov Chains.

{"text":"We have performed first-principles calculations to investigate the characteristics of phonon transmission across an epitaxial interface between Si and Ge, which are important for thermoelectric applications. We found that the phonon transmission is strongly suppressed at low frequencies due to the mismatch in acoustic impedance between two materials. The suppression becomes more significant as the thickness of Ge layer decreases. In addition, we observed that the phonon transmission exhibits strong anisotropy with respect to incident angle. These results suggest that it may be possible to control thermal transport by tuning the structure of epitaxial interfaces. Epitaxial interfaces play crucial roles in determining physical properties such as electrical conductivity [1] , optical reflectivity [2] , mechanical strength [3] , and thermal conductivity [4] . For example, recent studies on superlattices show that the thermal conductance can be reduced significantly compared to bulk values [5, 6] .\nIn this work, we focus on phonons because they dominate heat conduction in solids [7, 8] . Phonon scattering at epitaxial interfaces has been studied extensively using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations [9] or kinetic theory [10] . However, these approaches cannot provide detailed information about phonon transmission across interfaces since they do not take into account atomic interactions explicitly [11] .

We show that when agents have boundedly rational expectations about others' choices they may end up choosing an option which has no majority support but nevertheless becomes popular over time. This phenomenon can be explained as a consequence of herding behavior among agents who do not fully understand the underlying social network structure. Our results suggest that such herding behavior could play an important role for understanding the emergence of popularity in real-world settings like online communities or political elections. In many situations people make decisions based on what other people think. For example, consumers often base their purchase decision on reviews written by other customers [1] , while voters decide to vote for one candidate rather than another because of information received through word-of-mouth communication [2] .

{"text":"We present new results on the X-ray spectrum and variability properties of Mrk 509, one of the brightest Seyfert galaxies observed by XMM-Newton.

The best-fit parameters are consistent within errors to those found previously using Chandra data alone. No significant spectral changes were detected between different epochs separated by several months apart. However, we do detect strong flux variations at all energies during our observation period. In particular, there was a factor of 3 increase in the hard band count rate over about 20 ks followed by a slower decay back towards the initial level. This behavior can be explained if the source has been caught in a transition state where the accretion disk luminosity increased rapidly due to some instability or perturbation."}

{"text":"BaFeO3 is one of the most promising cathode materials for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). In this work, we have performed first-principles density functional theory calculations to investigate its electronic and magnetic properties in detail. We find that it has a metallic ground state with a large spin polarization at the Fermi level. The calculated band gap between the valence bands and conduction bands is 0.2 eV which agrees well with previous experimental results. Our calculation shows that there are two Fe-3d orbitals crossing the Fermi level, indicating that both Fe3+ ions and Fe4+ ions exist in the compound simultaneously. This result can be explained by the fact that the crystal field splitting energy is much smaller than the electron-electron interaction energies. Furthermore, our calculation indicates that the ferromagnetic ordering is mainly due to superexchange interactions mediated through oxygen atoms.  Finally, we also calculate the phonon dispersion relations along high symmetry lines within the framework of density functional perturbation theory."}

{"text":"We present an analysis of the distribution and properties of open clusters in the Galactic anticenter region, using data from the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS). We have compiled a list of all open clusters with angular diameters larger than 1 arcmin within a distance of 8 kpc from the Sun. The total number is about 1000. This sample includes most known open clusters in this part of the Galaxy. Using photometric distances derived by fitting theoretical stellar evolutionary tracks to observed color-magnitude diagrams for each cluster we construct maps showing their spatial distributions as well as their luminosity functions.

{"text":"We propose that the metallic enhancement observed for some post T Tauri stars (PTTS) may be due to an accretion of planetesimals during their formation phase, which is followed by rapid planet formation and subsequent ejection of planets into space.  We show that this scenario can explain both the high metallicity found among PTTS as well as the low abundance ratios between refractory elements such as Mg\/Si or Al\/Si compared with those expected if these objects formed through standard core-accretion processes. The proposed mechanism also explains why there are no known close-in giant planets around PTTSs despite the fact that they have already passed their protoplanetary disk stage. This model predicts that most PTTS should host at least one Jupiter mass planet on wide orbits beyond 1 AU. In addition we predict that many PTTS will exhibit infrared excesses caused by dusty debris disks produced by collisions between planetary bodies."}

INTRODUCTORY REMARK\nThe present work was motivated by the recent discovery [1] , based on WMAP data [2] , that the total energy density of the universe consists of two components -the ordinary matter density $\\rho_m$ and another component called \"dark energy\" whose density increases with time. In order to explain these results it has been suggested [3] that the dark energy could be due to some new form of energy associated with quantum vacuum fluctuations [4] . However, there are several problems related to such a proposal [5] .\nIn particular, if one assumes that the dark energy arises solely from quantum vacuum fluctuations then its value should depend only on fundamental constants [6] . On the other hand, the current observational constraints [7] suggest that the dark energy density varies over many orders of magnitude during cosmic evolution [8] . Moreover, the predicted values of the dark energy density obtained within different approaches differ considerably [9] ."}

We apply our method to compute the cross sections for inclusive jet production as well as dijet events containing one or two b quarks produced in pp collisions at the Fermilab Tevatron and CERN Large Hadron Collider. Our results show good agreement with available experimental data over a wide range of kinematic variables. In addition we provide detailed comparisons between different parton distribution functions (PDFs). These results can be used by both theorists and experimentalists to improve their understanding of perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), which is the theory underlying strong interactions among quarks and gluons. \n \n Jet production in hadronic colliders has been studied extensively since its discovery more than 40 years ago.

{"text":"The Double Chooz experiment is designed to measure the mixing angle \u03b813 by searching for the appearance of electron neutrinos in a muon neutrino beam produced at the CERN SPS accelerator complex and directed towards France. The near detector (ND) measures the flux, energy spectrum and composition of this beam with high precision. In addition it provides an accurate measurement of the backgrounds expected in the far detector (FD). This document describes how we exploit these measurements to improve our knowledge on the systematic uncertainties affecting the FD analysis. \nIntroduction\n\nDouble Chooz [1] aims at measuring the third mixing angle \u03b8 13 . It uses a reactor-based neutrino source located at about 1 km distance from its near detector ND280 [2] , which consists of several sub-detectors surrounding the target volume where neutrinos are created. The main goal of the experiment is to search for the appearance of electron-neutrinos in a muon-neutrino beam produced at CERN's Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS), as illustrated in Figure 1 .\nIn order to achieve the required statistical accuracy within reasonable running time, the experiment will run in two phases. Phase I started in 2011 and ran until 2014; during that phase only one out of four possible detectors was operational. Phase II has just begun and runs until 2019 or 2020 when all detectors should be fully operational. During both phases data taking takes place simultaneously with the far detector (FD) situated 12 m underground at a distance of 1 km from the ND280 target [3] . \nNeutrino Flux Prediction\nThe prediction of the neutrino flux \u03a6(E\u03bd ) reaching the ND280 detector depends on many parameters such as: the number N p of protons hitting the production target per second, their kinetic energy T p , the fraction f \u03c0 0 of neutral pions decaying into photons, the pion momentum distribution dN\/dp\u03c0 etc.. These quantities can be measured directly using dedicated calibration experiments [4] .

{"text":"We present results for multidimensional, multi-group flux-limited diffusion (MGFLD) calculations of convection and acoustic oscillations in the postbounce phase of corecollapse supernovae using an approximate treatment of neutrino transport. We find that our MGFLD models are able to reproduce many features observed in recent two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations including the growth rate of the SASI as well as its characteristic spiral mode structure. The MGFLD models also show similar behavior when we compare their shock radii evolution during the first few hundred milliseconds after bounce. However, there is some quantitative disagreement between the two approaches concerning the amplitude of the SASI which may be due to differences in the numerical methods used or possibly deficiencies in the MGFLD approach itself. In addition, we have performed several test runs where we artificially suppressed either the advective or the acoustic part of the MGFLD scheme. These tests indicate that both parts contribute significantly to the overall dynamics of the system but that the advective part plays by far the dominant role."}
{"text":"The deformation principle is the main tool in this article for constructing new geometric structures on physical spaces, which are not necessarily Riemannian manifolds but can be more general objects such as Finsler or pseudo-Finsler ones.  The basic idea behind it consists in deforming an initial space into another one by means of some suitable transformation group acting transitively on both spaces. This method allows to obtain many interesting results concerning various aspects of geometry and physics (e.g., geodesic flows,...). In particular, we show that any homogeneous Finsler manifold admits a canonical connection with totally skew-symmetric torsion whose curvature tensor satisfies certain properties similar to those satisfied by the Weyl conformal curvature tensor.

Gravitational waves are ripples in space-time that can be generated when massive objects accelerate or decelerate relative to each other. These waves carry energy away from their source at the speed of light and cause tiny changes in the distance between freely falling test particles.

{"text":"We report on the observation of ground state magneto optical resonance (GMOR) in cesium vapor confined to a sub-micron thickness layer inside a glass micro-cell. The GMOR is observed by measuring the transmission spectrum through the cell as it is rotated about its normal axis with respect to the direction of propagation of circularly polarized light. We show that this effect can be explained using simple classical electrodynamics and we present experimental results which demonstrate the dependence of the GMOR signal strength on various parameters such as the intensity, frequency detuning and polarization angle of the incident laser beam. This work opens up new possibilities for studying quantum optics phenomena at the single atom level. \n \n In recent years there has been considerable interest in developing techniques for trapping atoms or molecules within microscopic volumes [1] . Such confinement offers several advantages over conventional atomic beams experiments including increased interaction times between the trapped particles and the applied fields [2] , improved spatial resolution [3] and reduced Doppler broadening [4] . These features are particularly important when considering applications involving high precision measurements [5] .\nIn addition to these practical benefits, confining neutral matter to small dimensions also provides opportunities for exploring fundamental physics [6] . For example, the study of Bose-Einstein condensates [7, 8] requires cooling and trapping of large numbers of atoms into very tight traps [9] . Similarly, investigations into the properties of individual atoms [10] require their isolation from other sources of decoherence [11] .

{"text":"We present an analysis of the ages derived by applying the gyrochronological method to a sample of open clusters with known ages (from literature) in order to assess its reliability as well as possible systematics associated with it. We find that the age estimates are generally consistent within their uncertainties but there is some evidence for a small bias towards younger ages when compared against the true cluster ages. This bias may be due to the fact that we have used only one rotation period per star which does not take into account any scatter or spread in periods observed among coeval stars. The results presented here suggest that this technique can provide useful constraints on stellar ages if applied carefully taking into consideration all relevant sources of uncertainty. Keywords: Age determination, Open clusters, Rotation periods, Gyrochronology. 1 Introduction Stellar ages play a crucial role in many areas of astrophysics ranging from Galactic archaeology to exoplanet science. In particular, accurate ages are needed to understand how planets form and evolve over time. However, determining precise ages for individual stars remains challenging because they span several orders of magnitude in mass and luminosity and exhibit complex evolutionary histories. For example, while main-sequence turn-off ages can be determined accurately through photometric techniques such as fitting theoretical isochrones to colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs), these methods cannot be easily extended beyond the red giant branch where the effects of convection become important. Furthermore, even though asteroseismic observations allow us to probe the interiors of evolved stars, the interpretation of the resulting data requires detailed modelling of the structure and evolution of each star individually. As a result, other approaches must be explored to determine ages for large samples of stars spanning different stages of evolution.\nGyrochronology provides another avenue for estimating ages based on the spin-down rate of magnetic activity cycles driven by dynamo processes operating at the base of the solar convective zone (Barnes 2003) .

{"text":"The segmentation clock is an oscillatory gene regulatory network that controls the periodic formation of segments in vertebrates, such as vertebrae and ribs.  The segmentation clock consists of two interlocked feedback loops with different time scales; one loop involves genes Hes1-7 (Hairy\/Enhancer-of-split related) which are expressed periodically at every cycle of the other loop involving genes Notch-Delta-Stat3-Gata6-8-Hes7.  In this study we show how these two loops can be combined to produce stable limit cycles for all parameter values using a mathematical model based on ordinary differential equations.  We also demonstrate how the periodicity of the segmentation clock can be converted into a spatial pattern by coupling it to a reaction-diffusion system describing the production of morphogens.  Finally, we use our results to explain why mutations in some components of the segmentation clock lead to skeletal abnormalities while others do not."}
{"text":"We present new near-infrared photometry for the open cluster Westerlund 1, which is located in the Galactic bulge at a distance of 8 kpc (projected). We find that the red giant branch tip lies at K = 12.6 mag, corresponding to an age of about 10 Gyrs. The main sequence turn-off point occurs around K = 14.5 mag, indicating an age between 5 and 7 Gyrs. This places it among the oldest open clusters known. Using our data we derive a mean metallicity [Fe\/H] = -1.3 \u00b1 0.1 dex. From this value and using theoretical models we estimate the mass of the most massive star in the cluster as Mmax = 120 - 140M\u2299. In addition, we have obtained deep optical images with HST\/ACS\/WFC2 covering the central region of the cluster. These reveal several dozen very bright stars within a radius of only 20 arcsec."}
{"text":"The growth in stellar mass is driven by star formation, which occurs when dense gas collapses to form stars.  The rate at which this happens depends on how much gas there is available for collapse.   In turn, the amount of gas available for collapse depends on the balance between inflow (from larger scales) and outflow (from smaller scales).   This talk will discuss recent work that has been done using numerical simulations to understand these processes better. It will also present some new results on the role played by magnetic fields during star formation. Star formation takes place when dense gas clouds collapse under their own gravity into bound objects called protostars.  These protostars then grow through accretion until they reach the main sequence stage where nuclear fusion begins.  During this process, gravitational energy is released as radiation and kinetic energy, heating up surrounding material and driving powerful winds and jets.  As such, understanding what controls the rate at which stars are formed requires an understanding of how gas flows onto forming stars.  Gas can flow towards forming stars either directly or indirectly via filaments.  Directly flowing gas may be channeled along magnetic field lines while indirectly flowing gas may be transported along with turbulent motions.  Both types of flows have been observed around young stars but it remains unclear whether one type dominates over another.  Recent observations suggest that both direct and indirect flows play important roles depending on the environment.  For example, observations show that most low-mass stars accrete..."}
{"text":"We study how orbital behaviour in galactic dark matter haloes affects their shape, using N-body simulations with different initial conditions for the orbits of particles representing dark matter (DM). We find that DM haloes are more spherical when they have been assembled by chaotic orbits than by regular ones. This is because chaotic orbits tend to be less anisotropic than regular orbits at all radii within the halo. The effect is stronger if the fraction of chaotic orbits increases towards smaller radii. Our results suggest that the shapes of observed galaxy clusters can provide information about the nature of gravitational interactions between galaxies. In particular, we show that the cluster Abell 520 has an elongated shape which may indicate that it was formed through mergers involving many small subclusters rather than one large merger event. Galactic dark matter haloes are believed to consist mainly of collisionless cold dark matter particles whose dynamics is governed by gravity alone. However, there is growing evidence that these systems also contain significant amounts of hot gas and stars, as well as black holes. It remains unclear whether this baryonic component plays any role in determining the structure of dark matter haloes or not."}
{"text":"The alpha-helical structure is one of the most common secondary structures in proteins, and it plays an important role in protein folding\/unfolding processes.  In this work we analyze the results obtained by applying two different theoretical approaches to predict the stability of alphahelices against unfolding induced by temperature changes or chemical denaturants (urea). The first approach consists on using molecular dynamics simulations at constant pressure with explicit solvent molecules. We have performed these calculations for three peptides that contain between four and six amino acids per turn. Our results show that the presence of urea destabilizes the helical conformation more than increasing the temperature does. This effect can be explained as due to the preferential solvation of the peptide backbone by water molecules when compared to the side chains. The second method used here relies on statistical mechanics concepts applied to lattice models. These models are able to reproduce some features observed experimentally such as the dependence of the melting temperatures on the number of residues per turn."}

{"text":"In this article, we introduce the notion of modules over an operad in any symmetric monoidal category $\\mathcal{C}$ with unit object $I$.  We define the free module on a set $X$ to be the tensor product $\\bigotimes_{X\\times X} I$ (where $*$ denotes the cartesian product); it is shown that this construction satisfies all axioms for a free module except possibly associativity.   The missing axiom is established by showing that the free module on two sets $X,Y$ can be constructed as the coequalizer of certain morphisms between free modules on three sets $Z_1,Z_2, Z_3$ where $Z_1$ has one element less than $X$, $Z_2$ has one element more than $Y$, and $Z_3$ has one element less than $Y\\cup X$.    This result generalizes the classical theorem stating that the free group on a set $X$ is the quotient of the free group on the disjoint union of $X$ and its complement modulo the relation that identifies each element $x$ of $X$ with its inverse $x^{-1}$. \nThe main results are applied to give new proofs of some well-known theorems about groups, rings, algebras, Lie algebras, and Hopf algebras."}
{"text":"We consider the problem of detecting whether an unknown parameter belongs to a given closed interval or not, when observations are generated by a one-dimensional diffusion process with drift and volatility functions depending on this parameter. We propose a test statistic based on the supremum norm between the empirical distribution function (EDF) of the sample path and its theoretical counterpart under the null hypothesis. The asymptotic behavior is studied for both fixed and diverging time horizons. In particular we show that our test statistic converges weakly towards a functional of a standard Brownian bridge as the horizon increases. This result allows us to derive the exact level-alpha critical value of the proposed test at any finite horizon using Monte Carlo simulations. Finally, numerical experiments illustrate the performance of the proposed procedure compared to existing tests.

We show that this distribution converges to a stable law as n goes to infinity and we give explicit expressions for its parameters.

In particular, it allows one to compute the expected value and variance of the population size at any given generation. The main goal of our work is to extend these results to more general models which take into account the fact that individuals may die or disappear before reproducing themselves. More precisely, we consider a class of stochastic processes called L\u00e9vy processes whose paths are continuous but not necessarily differentiable.

{"text":"We present an analysis of the mass-metallicity relation (MMR) in galaxies, using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 (SDSS DR7). We use two different methods to estimate galaxy masses -the stellar-mass-to-light ratio method and the dynamical mass method-which are both calibrated against direct measurements of galaxy masses obtained by gravitational lensing. The MMR is found to be well described by a power law with index -0.25 \u00b1 0.01 dex\/log(M*), where M* denotes the total stellar mass within one effective radius Re. This slope agrees very well with previous studies based on smaller samples or less accurate estimates of galaxy masses. However, we find that our results differ significantly from those reported recently by Tremonti et al. (2004) , who claim a shallower slope of -0.16 \u00b1 0.02 dex\/log(M*) (a factor of 2 difference at high masses).\nThe origin of this discrepancy can be traced back to differences between the sample selection criteria used in these works. In particular, Tremonti et al. select their sample according to the presence\/absence of emission lines in the SDSS spectra, which introduces significant biases into the resulting distribution of metallicities. Our results show no evidence for such biases: when restricting ourselves to only star-forming galaxies, as done by Tremonti et"}
{"text":"We report on an unexpected reversal of temperatures between two components of a brown-dwarf eclipsing binary system, which we have discovered using infrared photometry and spectroscopy obtained with Spitzer Space Telescope (Werner et al., 2004) and Gemini Observatory (Gemini North telescope). The primary component is cooler than its secondary by about 300 K at optical wavelengths but warmer by about 100 K at near-infrared wavelengths. We find that this temperature inversion can be explained if both stars are irradiated by their mutual accretion disk. This finding suggests that the disks around young low-mass objects may be more complex than previously thought. \n \n Keywords: Accretion Disk, Inverse P-Cygni profile, Irradiation, Low-Mass Star, Near-Infrared Spectroscopy, Photometric variability, Stellar radius, Temperature inversion, Young star \n \n \n \n 1 Introduction \n \n An important goal for understanding how planets form is to determine what happens during the earliest stages of planet formation when protoplanetary disks surround young stellar systems. One key question concerns whether or not these disks evolve into planetary systems like our own solar system. To answer such questions it will be necessary to study individual examples of young circumstellar disks as they evolve over time. However, because most young stars are deeply embedded within dense molecular clouds, direct observations of the inner regions of these disks are difficult. Fortunately, some young stars are surrounded by optically thin dusty envelopes that allow us to probe the physical conditions near the central object through scattered light. These so-called transitional disks show evidence of clearing out large amounts of material inside several AU of the central star while still retaining significant quantities of gas farther away (Strom et al., 1989; Skrutskie et al., 1990; Calvet et al., 2002; Muzerolle et al., 2003; Sicilia-Aguilar et al., 2006; Espaillat et al., 2007) . \n \n A number of studies suggest that the outer edges of transitional disks are sculpted by photoevaporative winds driven off the surface of the disk by intense ultraviolet radiation from nearby"}

{"text":"We have studied the variation of the Amati relation (Amati et al., 2002) in a sample of about 100 GRBs detected by Swift satellite and we found that it is not constant, but varies as a function of redshift z. We also find that this effect cannot be explained only by selection effects due to detector thresholds. \n \n The observed evolution can be described by a power law dependence on cosmological time t~(1+z)3.5. This result suggests that there may exist some physical mechanism responsible for such behaviour. In particular, we suggest that the luminosity distance dL could play a role in determining the shape of the spectrum at high energies. If so, then the spectral properties of GRB prompt emission are related to its intrinsic luminosity rather than being determined solely by the geometry of the emitting region. \nThe results presented here support previous claims that the Amati relation should be used cautiously when applied to distant bursts."}
{"text":"We consider sums over random geometric graphs, where each graph is generated by placing points independently at random in some domain $\\Omega$ with density $\\lambda > 0$ (the expected number of points per unit volume), then connecting any two points that are within distance $r_0$ of one another.  We show how to approximate these sums using Monte Carlo sampling methods when the dimension $d$ of the space is large compared to the range parameter $r_0$; this improves upon previous results for such problems which required an assumption that the dimension was small relative to the range parameter. \nThe main idea behind our approach is to use the fact that if we have a collection of independent Poisson point processes $P_1, P_2, ..., P_n$ whose intensities sum up to 1, then their superposition can be viewed as a single Poisson process with intensity equal to the sum of the individual intensities. This observation allows us to reduce the problem of computing expectations under the distribution of a random geometric graph to the problem of computing expectations of functions of a single Poisson point process."}

{"text":"We report scanning magnetoresistance microscopy (SMRM) measurements on an atom chip with gold wires and microtraps fabricated by focused ion beam milling. The SMRM images show the magnetic field distribution in the vicinity of the wire structures, which are used to transport cold atoms between different trapping sites. We find that the magnetic fields generated by these wires can be accurately described using Biot-Savart's law for straight current-carrying conductors. In addition we observe small deviations from this model at distances below 100 nm from the surface of the wires. These deviations may arise due to stray currents induced in the substrate or due to nontrivial geometries of the wires close to their surfaces. Our results demonstrate that SMRM is well suited to study complex magnetic field distributions near microscopic objects such as atom chips. Atom chips have been developed over recent years as miniaturized devices for manipulating neutral atomic matter waves [1, 2] . They consist of arrays of metallic wires and microtraps produced by focused-ion-beam (FIB) milling [3] , where ultracold atoms are transported along the wires before being trapped in the microtraps [4] .\nIn order to optimize the performance of atom chips it is important to understand how the magnetic fields created by the wires affect the motion of the atoms. This requires detailed knowledge about the spatial structure of the magnetic fields around the wires. However, direct measurement techniques like SQUID-based magnetometry [5] cannot resolve the magnetic field distribution inside the wires because they are too thin [6] . Therefore indirect methods based on imaging the trajectories of atoms released from traps [7, 8] or measuring the forces acting on them [9] were employed instead. Recently, scanning Hall probe microscopy was applied to measure the local magnetic field strength [10] . Here we present scanning magnetoresistance microscopy [11] data obtained on an atom chip consisting of two parallel gold wires connected via a junction [12] . By comparing our experimental results with theoretical predictions we obtain information about the magnetic field distribution in proximity of the wires."}

However, if there are massive fields present then the energy density will increase because of the presence of these massive fields. This additional contribution to the energy density is called the thermal correction term.

{"text":"We study deviations from tri-bimaximal neutrino mixing in the type-II seesaw model with an additional U(1) gauge symmetry, which is broken at high energy scales by two Higgs doublets. We show that this scenario can be realized within the framework of supersymmetric grand unified theories (SUSY GUTs). In particular we consider SO(10) SUSY GUT models where the right-handed Majorana mass matrix for the light neutrinos arises from the vacuum expectation values of three pairs of Higgs fields transforming as 10 \u2295 126 \u2295 120 under SU(5), while the Dirac mass matrices are generated through Yukawa couplings to 16-plet fermions. The resulting effective neutrino mass matrix has off-diagonal entries proportional to the ratio between the masses of the heavy and light neutrinos. This leads to corrections to the tribimaximal pattern of neutrino mixings. Furthermore, we discuss leptogenesis in our model and find that it can account for the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe if the CP violating phases satisfy certain conditions."}

{"text":"We present an algorithm for computing spherical wavelets and their associated scaling functions, which are used to analyze data defined over the unit sphere in three dimensions. The method is based on a decomposition into spherical harmonics and can be applied to any function that has been expanded as such.

As examples we apply our technique to calculate correlation functions of CMB temperature fluctuations and to compute power spectra of simulated galaxy surveys. Finally, we discuss possible extensions of these methods to higher-dimensional spaces. Wavelets have become popular tools for analyzing various types of data sets ranging from images to time series. In cosmology they were first introduced by Bond & Efstathiou (1987) who showed how they could be used to efficiently calculate angular correlations of cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB). Since then many authors have employed wavelets to study different aspects of large-scale structure formation including the evolution of dark matter haloes (e.g., Colombi et al. (1998) ), gravitational lensing effects (e.g., Jain et al. (2000)), weak gravitational lensing statistics (e.g., Schneider et al. (2002)) , and the clustering properties of galaxies (e.g., Percival et al. (2003)). However, all previous studies focused exclusively on flat space where it was straightforward to define wavelets using translations and dilations of mother wavelets. This situation changes dramatically when considering three-dimensional data sets like those obtained with modern astronomical instruments. Here, the concept of translation becomes ambiguous because there exists no unique way to identify corresponding points at different locations within the sample volume. Moreover, the notion of scale loses its meaning since distances cannot be measured directly but only inferred indirectly through redshift distortions caused by peculiar velocities."}
{"text":"The evolution of stars is driven by nuclear fusion reactions in their cores, which generate energy that powers the star's luminosity.  The rate at which these reactions occur depends on how much fuel (i.e., helium) there is available to burn.   As the core contracts during its red giant phase, it becomes denser and hotter, increasing the pressure inside the core until the temperature reaches about 100 million degrees Celsius.  At this point, helium begins burning rapidly, releasing large amounts of energy into the surrounding plasma.  This causes the outer layers of the star to expand outward as they are pushed away by the increased pressure generated within the core.  Eventually, the expanding outer layers become so thin that they can no longer support themselves against gravity;  the star then collapses back onto itself, forming a white dwarf or neutron star.   In addition to nuclear fusion reactions occurring in the core, some massive stars also undergo explosive nuclear fusion reactions called supernovae, which eject most of the star's mass out into space.   These explosions release huge amounts of energy and light, making them visible across great distances in the night sky.   During my career studying stellar astrophysics, I have been fortunate enough to witness many spectacular events such as these first hand.   ..."}

Finally, we present some results on global stability by using Lyapunov functionals. In recent years, many mathematical models have been proposed to describe the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases [1] . These models can be classified into single-strain models [2] , multi-strain models [3] - [6] and metapopulation models [7] .\nIn particular, multi-strain models play important roles in understanding how different pathogens interact within hosts [8] . For example, it was shown that co-infection may lead to extinction [9] ; while superinfection may cause periodic oscillations [10] . Recently, Li et al. [11] studied a multi-strain epidemic model with nonlinear incidence rates and found that the disease-free equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable under certain conditions. However, they did not consider the effect of cross immunity between strains. Cross immunity refers to partial protection against subsequent infections caused by other strains [12] .

One interesting question concerns the behavior of these systems when they are confined into small volumes [6] .\nThe purpose of this work is to investigate the properties of a particular class of confining gauge theories known as supersymmetric Yang-Mills (SYM). These theories are defined in terms of a set of fields transforming under the adjoint representation of SU(N), and possess both bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom [7] . They play an important role in string theory [8] , and provide useful toy models for studying non-perturbative phenomena [9] . A particularly simple example of SYM is given by the so-called Seiberg-Witten limit [10] , where the gauge group is taken to be U(1).\nOne of the most remarkable features of SYM is its ability to confine quarks even though no fundamental scalar fields exist [11] . This phenomenon occurs because the vacuum expectation values of certain operators acquire non-vanishing VEVs leading to spontaneous breaking of global symmetries [12] . As a result, electrically charged excitations called \"dyons\" appear in the spectrum [13] . It turns out that the interactions between dyons lead to confinement [14] . Moreover, the"}
{"text":"We present new spectroscopic observations in the near-infrared (NIR) for a sample of about 100 HII regions located along the major axis of the nearby spiral galaxy M33, at distances between 1 kpc and 8 kpc from its center. The main goal is to study how the chemical composition changes with galactocentric distance within this galaxy. We have used the NIR spectrograph ISAAC on board the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope UT1 telescope to obtain high signal-to-noise ratio spectra covering the wavelength range 0.9-2.5 microns. From these data we derive oxygen abundances using two different methods based on strong emission lines. In addition, we use our results together with published photometric data to construct radial profiles of several physical parameters such as electron density, temperature or ionized gas mass fraction. Our analysis shows that there are no significant differences between both abundance determination techniques. However, when comparing our results with previous studies carried out by other authors it becomes clear that some discrepancies exist among them which can be explained mainly due to the fact that they were obtained under very different observational conditions."}
{"text":"We present the first measurement of the ionization fraction in an isolated dark cloud, using observations with Herschel Space Observatory's Heterodyne Instrument for the Far Infrared (HIFI). We detect emission lines from C+, O+, N+, S+, Si+, Ar+, Fe+, HCO+, H2S+, and H2O+ toward the core of Barnard 68 (B68), which is located at a distance of 140 pc. The observed line intensities are used to derive the fractional ionizations of carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, silicon, argon, iron, hydrogen cyanide, hydrosulfide, and water molecules relative to molecular hydrogen. These results show that B68 has a low degree of ionization compared to other star-forming regions such as Orion A or W51 e1\/e2. This suggests that star formation may be suppressed by magnetic fields and\/or cosmic rays in this region."}
{"text":"The author discusses how to solve the quark confinement problem by using the concept of the mass gap, which is defined as the difference between the masses of quarks and hadrons.  He also explains that this approach can be used for solving other problems related with strong interactions such as spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking (SCSB) and color superconductivity (CSC). Finally he shows some results obtained recently on these topics. In the first part we have discussed the basic ideas behind the formulation of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), the theory describing the strong interaction among quarks and gluons at low energies. We have seen that it predicts the existence of bound states made up of one or more quarks called hadrons, but does not explain why they are confined inside ordinary matter. This phenomenon known as quark confinement has been an open question since the discovery of QCD almost thirty years ago. It turns out however that there exists another property of QCD, namely its asymptotic freedom, which allows us to understand the origin of confinement. Asymptotic freedom means that the coupling constant decreases when the energy increases so that at very high energies the force becomes weak enough to allow quarks and gluon to escape from each other without being trapped into hadronic states. However, if we want to study the properties of hadrons like their masses and decay widths, then we need to use perturbation theory around the ground state where the coupling constant is large. Therefore, although we know what happens at short distances, we do not know exactly what happens at larger ones."}
{"text":"The MICS-Asia phase 2 (MIPAS-Atmospheric Chemistry and Climate) is an international project aimed at improving our understanding on atmospheric composition, chemistry and climate in East Asian region by using satellite observations as well as model simulations. In this study we investigate how different chemical mechanisms affect simulated ozone distribution over East Asia during summer monsoon season based on two global models with different chemical schemes. The results show that both models can reproduce observed features of tropospheric ozone distributions reasonably well but they have some differences especially for lower stratosphere where the difference between the two models reaches up to 20 ppbv. We also find that the sensitivity of simulated ozone to changes in emissions varies greatly among different regions due to their different photochemical regimes. For example, increasing NOx emission leads to higher ozone concentration near source areas while it decreases ozone concentrations elsewhere. This suggests that accurate representation of regional sources may be important when simulating ozone pollution problems."}
{"text":"We present the results of our analysis on two gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) detected by Swift satellite, GRB 050410 and its afterglow at optical wavelengths, and GRB 050412; we find that both events have very low luminosities in their prompt emission phase as well as in their X-ray afterglows; this is consistent with them being \"dark\" GRBs.  We also report the detection of an unusual radio flare associated to GRB 050410 which may be related to the central engine activity or to late-time energy injection into the relativistic jet. The first event was discovered by Swift\/BAT on April 10th 2006 at 07:41:06 UT [1] . It triggered BAT again at 08:47:12 UT [2] , but no further triggers were recorded until 09:55:43 UT [3] when it re-triggered BAT for one more time [4] .\nThe second event was discovered by Swift \/BAT on April 12th 2006 at 06:52:53 UT [5] . No other triggers were recorded until 07:30:00 UT [6] when it re-triggered; however, there was another trigger at 07:45:20 UT [7] . Both events had durations longer than 2 s [8] ; therefore, they could not be classified as short-duration GRBs [9] .  They did not show any evidence of extended emission [10] nor multiple peaks [11] during their prompt phases [12] ."}

{"text":"The PVLAS collaboration has recently reported results on light-by-light scattering in vacuum, which are inconsistent with Standard Model predictions.  In this note we discuss possible interpretations of these data within the framework of quantum field theory and string theory. We argue that the most natural interpretation is to assume that the observed effect arises due to new particles coupling to photons via an effective dimension-8 operator. The required mass scale for such particles can be as low as 10 GeV or even lower if one assumes that they couple only weakly to ordinary matter. If confirmed by further experiments, these observations would have profound implications both for particle physics phenomenology and cosmological models. The PVLAS collaboration has recently announced their measurement of light-by-light scattering in vacuo [1] . This process violates parity conservation at tree level and thus cannot occur in the Standard Model (SM) [2] , but it could arise through loop effects [3] .\nIn particular, the authors report observing a signal consistent with the SM prediction [4] \nwhere G F = 1.1663787(6) \u00d7 10\u22125GeV\u22122 is Fermi's constant [5] , \u03b8 W \u2248 0.23 is the weak mixing angle [6] , m e is the electron mass, and M Pl \u2261 1\/ \u221a 8\u03c0G N \u2248 2\u00d710 18 GeV is the reduced Planck mass [7, 8] . However, the measured value of the cross section exceeds the theoretical expectation by more than three standard deviations,\nThis discrepancy between experiment and theory may indicate the presence of new physics beyond the SM [9] ."}
{"text":"The rigidity dependent cosmic ray (CR) energy spectrum has been measured by using the GAMMA detector at Mt. Norikura, Japan for more than three years since 2003. The results are compared to those reported previously and also to theoretical predictions based on diffusive shock acceleration theory. It is found that the observed CR fluxes agree well with the prediction within experimental errors except around 10^15 eV where the data show an excess over the prediction. This may be due to some unknown effects such as solar modulation or local sources. \n \n Keywords: Cosmic rays; Knee; Diffusive shock acceleration; GAMMA Experiment; Rigidity dependence; Energy Spectrum; Solar Modulation; Local Sources. 1 Introduction \n \n In recent years there have been many reports about the observation of cosmic ray particles up to energies beyond 10^18eV [1] . However, it remains unclear how these energetic particles were accelerated to such high energies [2] . One possible mechanism which can accelerate charged particles to extremely high energies is diffusive shock acceleration [3] , which was first proposed by Fermi [4] . According to this model, charged particles gain their kinetic energy through repeated scatterings off magnetic irregularities near the shock front produced by supernova explosions [5] .\n \nIn order to study the origin of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays, we need to measure their energy spectrum precisely [6] . Since the number density of cosmic rays decreases rapidly with increasing energy, direct measurement becomes difficult above ~10^14eV [7] . Therefore, indirect methods must be used to determine the energy spectrum [8] . For example, one method uses the intensity ratio between different secondary products created when cosmic rays interact with atmospheric nuclei [9] . Another method utilizes the fact that the gyroradius of a particle depends strongly on its momentum [10] . By measuring the angular distribution of cosmic rays arriving at ground level, one can obtain information about the primary cosmic ray spectrum [11] . \n \n In this work, we report our measurements of the cosmic ray energy spectrum made with the GAMMA experiment [12] located at Mt.

{"text":"We present the first detection and characterization of infrared extinction law (IRAL) toward an extremely dark cloud core, L183. The IRAL is derived by comparing near-infrared to mid-infrared colors between background stars and foreground objects projected on the same line-of-sight through the cloud. We find that the IRAL shows no significant variation with depth into the cloud down to A V = 1000 mag. This result suggests that dust grains are not significantly modified even under such extreme conditions as those found deep inside dense clouds. Our results also suggest that grain growth may be suppressed in these environments due to efficient shattering caused by collisions among large grains. These findings have important implications for understanding the formation process of planetesimals. \n \n Keywords: Infrared extinction law, Dust properties, Interstellar medium, Shock waves \n \n 1. Introduction \n \n It has been suggested that interstellar dust grains grow up to millimeter sizes or larger within dense molecular clouds because they can survive against destructive collisions with other particles (e.g., coagulation theory; Ossenkopf & Henning 1994). However, recent observations show that there exist many small dust grains in dense regions where the gas density exceeds 10^6 cm^{-3} (e.g., Stepnik et al. 2003; Pagani et al. 2003), which contradicts this scenario. To resolve this discrepancy, it was proposed that dust grains could be destroyed efficiently via collisional fragmentation when their size becomes comparable to the mean free path of hydrogen molecules (Ormel et al. 2007). \n \n Another possibility is that dust grains do not grow but rather fragment into smaller pieces during collisions (e.g., Blum & Wurm 2008). If so, then we would expect to see some evidence of grain destruction products like sub-micron-sized fragments in dense clouds. Indeed, several observational studies reported the presence of sub-millimeter emission features attributed to silicate and\/or carbonaceous materials in dense clouds (e.g., Jones et al. 1993; Chiar et al. 1998; Kessler"}
{"text":"The renormalization group is used to study the effective action in quantum gravity, which describes how matter fields interact with gravitons.  The gravitational field equations are derived by varying this action with respect to the metric tensor. This approach leads to an understanding of why general relativity has no ultraviolet divergences at one-loop order (i.e., when only one graviton loop is included). It also provides insight into the physical meaning of the cosmological constant term that appears in Einstein's field equations. In addition, it allows us to calculate corrections to the classical theory due to higher-order terms in the expansion of the effective action about flat space-time. Finally, we discuss some open problems related to the application of these techniques to more complicated theories such as superstrings or supergravity. The renormalization group is applied to the problem of studying the effective action in quantum-gravitational systems. We derive the gravitational field equations by varying this action with regard to the metric tensor. These results provide insights into the physical meaning of both the cosmological constant appearing in Einstein's field equations and the corrections to the classical theory arising from higher-order terms in the effective-action expansion around flat spacetime."}

The method is based on the use of high-order accurate spatial reconstruction operators combined with a novel time integration strategy that ensures strict entropy stability in ideal MHD as well as positivity preservation of all primitive variables under non-ideal conditions. We demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of our new code by performing several standard tests including shock tube problems, linear waves, nonlinear wave interactions, and accretion disk simulations. In addition we perform 3D GRMHD simulations of black hole jets using both ideal and resistive MHD models. Our results show good agreement with previous numerical studies and analytical predictions.

{"text":"The Coulomb drag effect is the phenomenon where one charge carrier can transfer energy to another by exchanging virtual phonons, leading to an electric current in the second carrier that opposes its own motion.  In this work we study the Coulomb drag between two graphene sheets separated by a dielectric spacer layer and subject to different gate voltages. We find that for small separation distances (less than 10 nm) there are significant deviations from the predictions based on the standard theory developed for bulk materials. These deviations arise due to the presence of evanescent modes which couple strongly with the carriers at low energies. For larger separations these effects become negligible as expected. The results presented here provide useful information about how to design devices such as transistors or thermoelectric generators using graphene layers. \nI. INTRODUCTIO N\nGraphene has attracted considerable attention recently because it exhibits unique electronic properties [1] . It consists of carbon atoms arranged into a honeycomb lattice structure and behaves like a two-dimensional electron gas when doped [2] .\nOne interesting property of graphene is the so-called Coulomb drag effect [3] , i.e., the generation of an electric current in a second sheet of electrons moving through a first sheet of electrons even if they do not interact directly [4] . This effect arises because both carriers exchange virtual phonons via their mutual interaction mediated by the substrate [5] . As a result, the current density in the second carrier depends on the velocity of the first carrier [6] . Since the discovery of the Coulomb drag effect in semiconductors [7, 8] many theoretical studies have been performed [9] - [11] . However, only very few experiments were carried out so far [12] - [14] mainly due to difficulties associated with fabricating samples with high quality interfaces [15] . Recently, several groups succeeded in growing high-quality epitaxial graphene [16] - [18] opening up new possibilities for studying the Coulomb drag effect experimentally [19] - [21] ."}
{"text":"We present an ergodic model to describe the evolution of the electron density in a spherical nanoplasma expanding into vacuum, which is driven by the pressure difference between the plasma and its surroundings.  The model takes into account the effect of collisions on the electrons as well as their thermal motion inside the sphere. We show that this simple model can reproduce experimental results obtained with gold nanoparticles irradiated at different laser intensities. Nanoparticles are widely used in many fields such as medicine or catalysis but also in fundamental research like plasmonics where they play a key role. In particular, it has been shown recently that these particles can be produced using femtosecond lasers [1] . However, there still remain open questions about how these particles evolve after being created [2] .\nIn order to understand better what happens during the formation process of nanoparticles we have developed a theoretical model based on the assumption that the particle expands adiabatically [3] , i.e., without any heat exchange with its environment [4] . This approach allows us to obtain analytical expressions for the time dependence of the radius R(t) and temperature T (t). These predictions were compared successfully against experiments performed with gold nanoparticles [5] ."}
{"text":"We present an algorithm for multiple pattern matching in the context of string searching, which is based on a novel application of the theory of finite-state Markov chains to this problem. The proposed method can be used as a subroutine within any general-purpose search engine and it has been implemented into the open-source software package Apache Lucene (http:\/\/lucene.apache.org\/). We show that our technique outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms by up to two orders of magnitude when applied to real-world text collections containing millions of documents. In addition we demonstrate how our method can be extended to support approximate searches with user-specified error bounds. Multiple pattern matching plays an important role in many applications such as information retrieval or data mining. For example, consider a scenario where one wants to find all occurrences of a set of keywords in large document collections. This task becomes particularly challenging if there are several hundred thousand or even million documents available because then the number of possible matches grows exponentially fast."}
{"text":"We report on the discovery and analysis of two new Supergiant Fast X-ray Transients (SFXTs) in our sample of INTEGRAL sources, IGR J16194-2810 and AX J1841.0-0536. The first one is located at high galactic latitude while the second one lies close to the Galactic plane. Both are characterized by short outbursts lasting less than an hour with peak luminosities up to 1035 erg s-1. We have performed detailed spectral analyses for both sources during their active states using data collected by XMM-Newton and Swift observatories. For each source we find that the spectrum can be well fitted by either a blackbody model or a combination of a blackbody plus power law component. In addition, we also detect absorption features which may indicate the presence of dense winds around these systems. These results suggest that SFXTs share some similar properties as other HMXBs but they show more extreme characteristics such as higher temperatures and lower column densities."}
{"text":"In this work, we present the results of an extensive measurement study on the characteristics and dynamics of peer-to-peer (P2P) Internet Protocol Television (IPTV). We collected traffic traces for more than two months in three different countries using several hundred dedicated monitoring hosts deployed at ISPs around the world. Our analysis shows that P2P-TV is responsible for up to 80% of all video streaming traffic observed by these monitors. In addition, our measurements reveal significant differences between the behavior of various P2P-TV systems. Finally, we show how such knowledge can be used to detect P2P-TV streams with high accuracy even when they are encrypted or use proxies. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents related work. Section 3 describes our experimental setup. Sections 4-7 present detailed analyses of the data obtained during our experiments.

{"text":"We present the first results on two massive binary systems with periods longer than 100 days that are potential targets for future space-based optical interferometers such as SIM or TPF-I. The primary stars in these binaries have masses between 8 to 12 Msun and their companions are less massive (1-5 Msun). We used high resolution spectroscopy obtained at McDonald Observatory to determine orbital parameters for both systems. In addition we determined stellar atmospheric properties using photometric data taken by Hipparcos satellite and spectroscopic observations made at McDonald Observatory. Our analysis shows that the components of HD 37362 system are very similar while those of HD 54672 differ significantly. This is consistent with our expectations based on evolutionary models which predict that the more massive star will evolve faster and become redder. These results demonstrate that it may be possible to use astrometric measurements combined with radial velocity curves to measure directly mass loss rates due to winds driven by radiation pressure."}

Here $\\bar{k}$ denotes the algebraic closure of $k$ and $Aut_k(H^1(X;\\mathbb{Z})) = H^2(X;\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$. This generalizes results by Grothendieck (for curves), Deligne-Mostow (for abelian varieties), and Katz-Lang (for hyperelliptic curves). We also show how this result can be used to give new proofs of some classical theorems about rational points on varieties. The main ingredient of our proof is a generalization of the notion of \"Belyi pairs\" introduced by Mumford. In particular we introduce the concept of \"Galois coverings with ramification data\" which are certain covers of schemes equipped with additional structure encoding information about their ramifications."}
{"text":"We present new XMM-Newton observations of the Wolf Rayet binary system WR147, which is one of only two known systems with an O-type companion star and a WN6-7h primary component (the other being WR20a). The data were obtained in December 2004 during revolution number 1253-1255 using all three EPIC cameras on board XMM-Newton. We have analyzed these data to search for periodicities in both light curves as well as line profiles. No significant periodicity was found in either the light curve or line profile analysis. However we find that there are differences between the line profiles observed by Chandra and those seen here. These differences may be due to orbital motion within this highly eccentric system.

It was detected by WFPC2 as a point-like object with mF606W ~ 26 mag., mF814W ~ 25 mag. (Vega system) and mH ~ 20 mag.. We have obtained additional photometry for this object using the ESO NTT telescope equipped with SOFI camera. Our results show that it has very red colors (R-I > 5 mag.) and its spectrum exhibits strong absorption features characteristic of late-type stars. Its absolute magnitude M(K) = -4.3 \u00b1 0.1 suggests that we are dealing with either a brown dwarf or a low-mass star."}
{"text":"We present new measurements of line emission for the brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) in clusters with z < 0.3, using data obtained by the Chandra X-ray Observatory. We find that BCGs' optical luminosities are correlated strongly with their soft-band X-ray luminosities; this correlation is stronger than previously reported correlations between optical and radio luminosity or between optical and infrared luminosity.  The observed relationship can be explained if we assume that most of the X-rays come from inverse Compton scattering off hot electrons associated with the central supermassive black holes. This result suggests that there may be an evolutionary link between active galactic nuclei and BCGs. In addition to the strong correlation between Lopt and LX , we also observe a weak but significant anti-correlation between Lopt and the temperature Tgas of the intracluster medium surrounding each galaxy. These results suggest that the gas density around these galaxies decreases as they evolve into more massive systems."}
{"text":"The Earth's rotation axis is not fixed, but wobbles around its mean position with respect to distant stars (polar motion). The amplitude and phase of this wobble are determined by many factors including tidal forces between the Earth and other bodies such as the Sun and Moon.  Free Core Nutation (FCN) refers to an oscillation of the Earth's spin axis that occurs at a period of about 430 days. This phenomenon has been observed for more than 50 years using ground-based radio telescopes observing the positions of celestial objects near the celestial poles. In this study we use data spanning over 30 years obtained from two observatories located on opposite sides of the globe to investigate how FCN varies spatially across the surface of the Earth. We find that there exists significant differences in both the amplitudes and phases of the FCN signal recorded at each site. These results suggest that the FCN signal may be modulated by local geophysical effects which vary across the Earth's surface."}
{"text":"We present new observations at 1 mm and 3 mm wavelengths toward two Giant Molecular Clouds (GMC) in the Small Magellanic: Cloud, LMC N11B and 30 Doradus. We use these data to derive accurate masses for both GMCs by fitting their spectral energy distributions with modified blackbody functions. The derived masses are M(LMC N11B) = 2.1 x 10^6 M_sol and M(30 Doradus) = 5.2 x 10^7 M_sol . These values are significantly higher than those obtained using previous methods based on CO line measurements alone. This discrepancy is likely due to an underestimation of the gas temperature when only one or few lines are used as tracers. Our results show that the total cloud masses inferred from millimeter dust continuum emission can be up to three times larger than previously estimated. Millimeter dust continuum emission has been shown to provide more reliable estimates of the total cloud masses compared to other techniques such as single-dish radio observations of carbon monoxide (CO). However, most studies have focused on Galactic Giant Molecular Clouds (GMGs), while little work has been done towards extragalactic GMGs. In this study we present new observations at 1mm and 3mm wavelengths toward two Giant Molecular Clusters (GMCs) in the Small Magellan: Cloud, LMC N 11B and 30 Doradus; we also include archival data taken with the IRAM-30m telescope. Using these data sets we fit the observed SEDs with modified blackbody functions; our analysis shows that the derived masses are M(N11B)=2.1x10^6M_sol and M(Doradus)=5.2x10^7M_sol , which are significantly higher than those reported in previous works."}
{"text":"We study nearest neighbor spacing distribution (NNSD) for the beta-Hermite ensembles of random matrices, which are generalizations of the Gaussian orthogonal and unitary ensembles. We show that NNSDs can be expressed in terms of Meijer G-functions with parameters depending on the matrix size and the deformation parameter $\\beta$. The asymptotic behavior is studied by using the steepest descent method to evaluate the integral representation of the NNSD. In particular we find that the limiting density function has an oscillatory tail at large distances. \nThe results obtained here may have applications in statistical physics as well as number theory. Introduction Random Matrix Theory(RMT), first introduced by Wigner [1] , provides a powerful tool to investigate complex systems whose dynamics cannot be described by conventional methods [2] . It describes the statistical properties of eigenvalues of many-body quantum systems such as nuclear [3] or atomic [4] nuclei, chaotic billiards [5] , disordered conductors [6] , etc.. Recently RMT was also applied successfully to problems in other fields like combinatorics [7] , number theory [8] , signal processing [9] , finance [10] , biology [11] , geophysics [12] , and so on [13] .\nIn this work we consider the nearest neighbor spacing distribution (NNSD) for the beta-Hernite ensembles [14] , which are generalizations of Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE) [15] and Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE). These ensembles were originally proposed by Dyson [16] to describe the statistics of energy levels of heavy nuclei [17] . They are defined through their joint probability density functions \nwhere ${\\displaystyle \\Gamma }_{a,b}(x)$ denotes the incomplete Gamma-function [18] . Here M is the dimension of the matrices A and B, while \u03b2 is a real positive parameter characterizing the strength of the non-Hermiticity. For \u03b2 = 0, (1) reduces to the standard GOE\/GUE case. As shown below, the dependence of the NNSD on the matrix size M and the deformation parameter \u03b2 will lead to interesting phenomena."}
{"text":"We report on the impedance spectroscopic study of epitaxially grown BiFeO3 (BFO) and BaTiO3 (BT) thin films with different thicknesses, deposited by pulsed laser deposition technique onto single crystal SrTiO3 substrates. The dielectric properties are investigated in the temperature range between 300 K to 450 K at various frequencies ranging from 1 kHz to 10 MHz. It is found that both BFO and BT show ferroelectric behavior as evidenced by their frequency dependent hysteresis loops. In addition, we observe an anomaly near 420 K for all samples which can be attributed to the phase transition from rhombohedral to tetragonal structure in BFO film. \n \n We also find that the dielectric constant decreases with increasing measurement frequency while it increases with decreasing sample thickness. This observation suggests that there exists space charge polarization in these films. Moreover, the dielectric loss shows strong dependence on the measurement frequency and sample thickness."}
{"text":"The dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) is an essential component of the muscle cell membrane, which provides structural support to skeletal muscles during contraction.  The DGC consists of several proteins including dystrophin, sarcoglycans, syntrophins, dystrobrevins, and utrophin.   In Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), mutations in the gene encoding for dystrophin lead to loss of this protein from the sarcolemma resulting in severe muscle wasting.  However, it has been shown that expression of utrophin can compensate for the absence of dystrophin by binding to other components of the DGC such as alpha-dystroglycan (alpha-DG).  This study investigated whether processing of beta-dystroglycan affects its ability to bind with utrophin or its homologous counterpart, dp116, using normal mouse Schwann cells (MSC) and mdx mice lacking functional dystrophin.  Beta-dystroglycan was found to be processed into two different forms in both MSCs and mdx sciatic nerves.  One form had a molecular weight similar to that observed in normal mouse brain tissue while another form showed higher mobility when compared to the first one.  Both forms were able to interact with utrophin but only the lower molecular weight form could also bind to dp116.  These results suggest that processing of betadystroglycan may affect its interaction with utrophin and\/or dp116."}
{"text":"We present the results of an analysis of high-resolution optical spectra obtained with the Subaru Telescope for a sample of young, low-mass (0.5-2 Msun) PMS stars in Orion Nebula Cluster. We find that most of these objects show significant periodic variability on timescales ranging between 1 day to several months. The observed periods are consistent with those expected if the photometric variations result from rotational modulation due to starspots and\/or plages. In addition we detect strong H\u03b1 emission lines which indicate chromospheric activity. Our observations suggest that many of our targets have relatively rapid rotation rates compared to older field dwarfs at similar masses. This is likely caused by tidal locking during their formation process. Finally, we also report the detection of two new spectroscopic binaries among our target list. These systems will be useful as benchmarks for testing theoretical models of binary evolution."}

We use two different methods to measure the surface brightness profile, one using an adaptive kernel smoothing technique and another fitting S\u00e9rsic models directly to the observed galaxy light distributions. The resulting total magnifications are consistent within uncertainties among these two approaches. For each system we fit both singular isothermal sphere (SIS), as well as SIE + external shear model to the observed image positions and flux ratios simultaneously. In all cases, the best-fit SIE + external shear models provide better fits than those obtained by assuming only SIS model. Our analysis shows that the average slope of the inner part of the lens potential is shallower than -1, which indicates that dark matter halos around massive early-type galaxies may be more centrally concentrated than previously thought."}
{"text":"We propose an excitable convolutional neural network (CNN) model for solving the 2D path planning problem in this work. The proposed method is based on the concept that the output of each layer can be considered as a potential field, and the final solution will emerge when all layers are combined together. We show how to train such a multi-layered CNN using backpropagation through time with gradient clipping. In addition, we also present two different methods to combine multiple fields into one single field by applying either linear or nonlinear combination functions. Finally, we demonstrate our approach on several benchmark problems including maze navigation, robotics motion planning, and autonomous driving. Keywords: Convolutional Neural Network, Backpropagation Through Time, Gradient Clipping, Maze Navigation, Motion Planning, Autonomous Driving. 1 Introduction Convolutional neural networks have been widely used in computer vision applications [1] . Recently, they were applied to solve various types of optimization problems [2] , which include image classification [3] , object detection [4] , semantic segmentation [5] , etc.. However, most existing works focus only on optimizing a single objective function [6] - [8] .\nIn many real-world applications, there may exist more than one objective function [9] . For example, in robotic motion planning [10] , it usually requires finding collision-free paths while minimizing energy consumption [11] ; in autonomous driving [12] , it needs to find safe trajectories under both kinematic constraints [13] and dynamic traffic conditions [14] at the same time; in medical diagnosis [15] , it should consider not only disease prediction [16] but also treatment recommendation [17] simultaneously; in computational biology [18] , it has to optimize protein folding [19] and drug design [20] at the same time. Therefore, it becomes necessary to develop new algorithms to handle multi-objective optimization problems [21] .\nRecently, deep reinforcement learning [22] was introduced to address multiobjective optimization problems [23] . It learns policies directly from raw data without requiring hand-crafted features [24] . However, its performance heavily relies on the quality of training data [25] . Moreover, it often suffers from high sample complexity [26] due to the large number of"}
{"text":"We present the first results for atmospheric dynamics in short period extra-solar gas giant planets (EGPs) using 3D general circulation models with radiative transfer and realistic opacities. We find that the night-side temperature is strongly dependent on opacity, which determines how much energy can be transported to space by radiation. The day-night contrast increases as we decrease the opacity because less heat escapes through the nightside atmosphere. This effect is more pronounced at lower pressures where convection becomes inefficient. For low enough opacities, the planet cools down completely during its orbit resulting in an extremely cold night side. Our simulations show that EGPs are likely to have very different climates depending on their composition.

{"text":"We present the results for hadron production in semiinclusive DIS off nuclei at large Bjorken x and low Q^2, obtained with the HERMES experiment using data taken between 1997 and 2002. The analysis is performed within the framework of collinear factorisation and the modified perturbative approach to nuclear shadowing developed by Frankfurt et al.. We find that the observed suppression of leading neutron production relative to deuterium can be explained by nuclear effects alone without invoking any additional mechanism such as intrinsic charm or gluon saturation. In addition we observe an enhancement of strange particle production which cannot be described by conventional partonic models but may be attributed to the presence of intrinsic strangeness in the proton wave function. \n \n 1 Introduction \n \n Semi-inclusive deep-inelastic lepton-nucleus scattering (SIDIS) has been studied extensively over many years both experimentally [1]-[6] and theoretically [7][8][9] . This process provides information about the quark structure of the target nucleus through measurements of final state particles produced in association with the scattered lepton. At high values of Bjorken-x, where the struck quarks are highly virtual, SIDIS probes the transition region between the non-perturbative regime governed by confinement physics and the perturbative domain dominated by short-distance interactions [10] . \nIn this kinematic range it becomes possible to study the properties of bound-state systems directly via their interaction with hard probe photons [11] , thereby providing insight into the dynamics underlying the formation of composite states [12] - [14] .\nTheoretical studies have shown that the cross section for SIDIS depends strongly on the transverse momentum k_T of the outgoing hadrons [15] - [17] . It was found that the dependence of the cross sections on k_T could be used to discriminate among different theoretical approaches [18] - [20] . For example, calculations based on the standard DGLAP formalism [21] predict a strong increase of the cross section with increasing k_T [22] while those employing the CCFM evolution equations [23] lead to much weaker dependences [24] . \n \n 2 Experimentally measured quantities"}
{"text":"We present constraints on models of neutrino mass, mixing angles, and interactions using data from the Planck satellite experiment. We use measurements of the cosmic microwave background temperature anisotropy power spectrum to constrain cosmological parameters including the sum of the masses of all three active neutrinos ( m ), the effective number of relativistic species at recombination (), and the primordial helium abundance (). The results are consistent with previous analyses but have improved precision due to the inclusion of polarization information in addition to temperature fluctuations. \n \n In particular we find that the total neutrino mass is constrained by Planck to be less than 0.23 eV at 95% confidence level for normal hierarchy or less than 0.28 eV for inverted hierarchy. These limits improve upon those obtained previously from WMAP7+SDSS3+HST by factors of 2.5-3.0. For comparison, these values correspond roughly to one third of an electron volt per neutrino flavor."}
{"text":"We present an extension to the standard model that includes gravity, based on Feynman's ideas about quantum gravity. The extended standard model is formulated in terms of gauge fields for all known interactions (including gravity) and fermions with spin 1\/2 or 1. We show how this theory can be derived from first principles using Feynman diagrams. In addition we discuss some phenomenological consequences such as neutrino masses and dark matter candidates. Finally we comment briefly on possible experimental tests of our proposal. This work was supported by NSF grant PHY-0456747. A theory of everything should include gravity along with other fundamental forces. Here we propose one such theory which extends the standard model including gravitational effects. Our approach follows closely Feynman's original idea of formulating quantum gravity in terms of gauge fields coupled to fermions. Using Feynman diagrams we derive the extended standard model from first principles. Some phenomenological consequences are discussed, e.g., neutrino mass generation via seesaw mechanisms and dark matter candidates. Possible experiments testing our proposal are also mentioned."}
{"text":"The authors report on observations made with the HESS telescope array, which detected emission at energies above 1TeV (1 teraelectronvolt) coming from an area within 0.2 degrees of the center of the galaxy M87.  The data are consistent with theoretical predictions that such emissions should be produced by particles accelerated near the event horizon of a supermassive black hole located there.   This is the first time this phenomenon has been observed outside our own Galaxy and it opens up new opportunities for studying particle acceleration processes around black holes. Black holes are among the most exotic objects known to science. They have no surface or edge but instead exist as singularities where space-time ends. In addition they exert enormous gravitational forces so that even light cannot escape their grasp. However, despite these extreme conditions, some scientists believe that matter can still be accelerated close to the speed of light inside the so-called \"event horizons\" surrounding black holes. Such high energy phenomena could produce extremely energetic photons called \"TeV gammas\" - short for Tera-Electron-Volt photons. These would then be detectable using ground-based telescopes like those used by the High Energy Stereoscopic System (HESS). On April 10, 2014, astronomers working with the HESS observatory announced the detection of TeV-gamma rays originating from the central region of the distant galaxy Messier 87 (M87), about 50 million light years away [1] . This was the first time that such radiation had ever been seen outside our own Milky Way [2] , opening up exciting possibilities for studying particle accelerators associated with black holes [3] .\nIn order to understand how this discovery came about we need to know more about what happens when matter falls into a black hole. As shown in Figure 1 below, if you were standing next to one you'd see nothing special happening until your distance from its centre became smaller than its Schwarzschild radius [4] . At this point gravity becomes so strong that all forms of matter become trapped inside the black hole's event horizon [5] . Inside the event horizon, however,..."}
{"text":"We report here the discovery of diffuse radio emission at 1.4 GHz with angular sizes ranging between 8 arcminutes (0.5 Mpc) and 3 minutes of arc (0.1 Mpc). The total flux density is about 0.2 Jy over an area of about 10 square degrees centered around the galaxy cluster Coma. This emission has been detected by cross-correlating two large surveys made with different telescopes and observing techniques. We discuss possible origins for this emission including synchrotron radiation produced by relativistic electrons accelerated in shocks associated with large-scale structure formation or cosmic rays interacting with magnetic fields in clusters of galaxies. In addition we show that our results are consistent with previous observations of extended radio halos in nearby galaxy clusters. Finally, we argue that the observed correlation between the radio power and X-ray luminosity of galaxy clusters can be explained if most of the energy injected into relativistic particles comes from supernovae explosions rather than AGN jets."}
{"text":"We report on the measurement of residual correlations in the decay products of the $pp$ system produced at rest, using data collected by the NA48\/2 experiment at CERN SPS with an integrated luminosity of 1 fb^{-1}.  The analysis is performed for pairs of charged particles emitted within a cone of half-angle 20 mrad around the beam axis. We measure the correlation function $R(q)$ as a function of the four-momentum difference $q$ between the two particles. In addition to the usual Coulomb interaction term, we observe a significant contribution due to final-state interactions (FSI). This effect can be described by a simple model based on the exchange of one or more pions between the two hadrons. FSI are found to depend strongly on the invariant mass of the pair. For pairs with masses below 0.6 GeV\/c^{2} they lead to a reduction of $R(0)$ by about 30% compared to the value expected without FSI effects."}
{"text":"We consider a wireless network where nodes selfishly forward packets to their neighbors, and study how cooperation among neighboring nodes can be used to improve performance. We propose a novel cooperative transmission scheme that allows each node to transmit its packet simultaneously on multiple channels using different power levels. The proposed scheme is shown to achieve higher throughput than existing schemes by exploiting spatial diversity across channels as well as power control over these channels. In addition, we show that our scheme achieves fairness between nodes without requiring any centralized controller or global information about the network topology. Finally, we present simulation results showing significant improvement in terms of both throughput and fairness compared to existing non-cooperative schemes.

{"text":"We study the orbital magnetization (OM) induced by spin-orbit coupling on a kagome lattice with chiral magnetic order, which is realized as an emergent property of the system at low temperatures. We show that the OM can be expressed in terms of the Berry curvature associated with the band structure near the Fermi level. The magnitude of the OM depends strongly on the strength of the spin-orbit interaction and the direction of the applied field. In particular, we find that when the external field points along one of the three equivalent <111> directions, there are two peaks in the temperature dependence of the OM. These results suggest that the OM may provide useful information about the nature of the ordered state in this material. \n \n Introduction \n \n Orbital magnetization (OM), also known as orbital polarization or orbital moment density, has been studied extensively for many years both theoretically [1]-[3] and experimentally [4]-[6] . It arises due to the presence of spin-orbit interactions [7][8][9] , and it plays important roles in various physical phenomena such as topological insulators [10] - [12] , quantum Hall effect [13] , and superconductivity [14] . Recently, the OM was observed in several materials including SrRuO3 [15] , La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 [16] , YbMgGaO4 [17] , and FeSe [18] .\n \nIn this work, we consider the case where the OM appears in a frustrated antiferromagnetically coupled spin-1\/2 Heisenberg model on a kagome lattice [19][20][21] [22] . This type of magnetic ordering occurs naturally in some compounds like Herbertsmithite [23] , ZnCu3(OH)6Cl2 [24] , and CuFeO2 [25] . However, these systems have relatively weak spin-orbit couplings compared to other transition metal oxides [26] . Therefore, they do not exhibit large values of the OM [27] . On the other hand, recently discovered iron-based pnictide\/chalcogenide compounds [28] - [30] possess strong spin-orbit interactions [31] , but their magnetic structures remain controversial [32] - [35] .

{"text":"We present an algorithm for identifying stragglers in round-trip data streams using Newton's identities, which are derived by applying the chain rule to matrix exponentials. We show that our approach is more efficient than existing methods based on linear regression or singular value decomposition (SVD). Our method also has lower memory requirements compared with SVD-based approaches. Finally, we demonstrate how our technique can be used to identify stragglers in real-world datasets such as Google Analytics clickstream logs. The problem of identifying stragglers arises when processing large volumes of data in parallel systems. Stragglers are slow processors whose presence degrades overall system performance. Identifying these stragglers allows us to take corrective action so that they do not affect other processes running simultaneously. For example, if a straggler process takes too much time to complete its task, then it may be possible to offload some work onto another processor to speed up execution."}
{"text":"We present an evolutionary model that describes the evolution of regulatory mechanisms controlling cell division rates in growing populations. The model is based on the assumption that cells can evolve to optimize their fitness by adjusting their growth rates according to environmental conditions, such as nutrient availability or population density. We show how this simple principle leads to the emergence of complex regulatory networks with multiple feedback loops and time delays. Our results suggest that these networks are robust against mutations but sensitive to changes in external conditions. This may explain why many organisms have evolved similar regulatory circuits despite differences in their genetic backgrounds. \nAuthor: Jens Palsson (University of California San Diego); David Botstein (Stanford University)\nSource: Science Express Online - ScienceDirect URL: http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1106.0571 DOI: 10.1088\/1741-5468\/2009\/01\/00011 \nThe authors propose a mathematical model describing the evolution of regulatory mechanisms governing cell division rates in growing bacterial populations.

The results show that both compounds are antiferromagnetic with N\u00e9el temperatures around $250K$. In addition to the main peaks corresponding to the Ni$^{2+}$ ions ordered antiferromagnetically along c-axis, there is an additional peak located between the main peaks which can be indexed as superlattice reflections due to ordering of Sr atoms on the A-site. This indicates that the Sr dopants induce charge density wave order into the system. We also found that the intensity ratio of the superlattice reflection to the main peak decreases when x increases indicating that the charge density wave becomes weaker for higher doping levels. These results suggest that the charge density wave state competes against the antiferromagnetic ground state."}
{"text":"We present an approach for deriving the effective interaction between particles in dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) by using the principle of force covariance, which is based on the idea that the forces acting upon each individual DPD particle are invariant under transformations of its position and velocity coordinates. We show how this method can be used to obtain the pairwise conservative and dissipative contributions to the DPD potential energy function as well as their corresponding coefficients. The resulting expressions agree with those obtained previously through other methods such as fluctuation-dissipation relations or molecular dynamics simulations. Finally we demonstrate our results by applying them to two different systems consisting of either one or three interacting particles. Dissipative particle dynamics (DPD; Hoogerbrugge & Koelman 1992a ,b ) has been widely applied to model complex fluids ranging from colloidal suspensions to polymeric solutions . In particular, it has been shown that DPD provides a good description of hydrodynamic phenomena at mesoscopic scales (Groot et al. , 1997; Groot & Warren , 1998 ) . However , despite its successes there have also been some criticisms regarding the validity of the underlying assumptions made when constructing the DPD formalism .\nIn order to address these issues , several authors have recently proposed alternative formulations of DPD where the basic principles behind the original formulation were modified . For example , in the so-called generalized DPD (GDPD ; Pagonabarraga et al. , 2007 ) , the concept of soft repulsion was replaced by a hard-core repulsive term while maintaining the same form of the dissipative and random terms . Other examples include the inclusion of additional degrees of freedom into the DPD equations of motion (e.g., angular variables; Laso & Sanz-Serna , 2006 ) , or the use of more sophisticated forms of the DPD thermostatting procedure (e.g., Andersen thermostat; Smit et al. , 1996 ) .\nThe aim of this work is to provide another possible way of extending the standard DPD formalism by introducing new concepts related to the transformation properties of the forces acting"}

In addition to these results we also present new bounds on the branching ratios of other rare kaon decays like $K\\to\\pi^+\\pi^0$ or $K\\to\\pi^-\\gamma$. \nPACS numbers: 11.30.Er, 12.38.Gc, 13 .25.Hw \nI. INTRODUCTORY REMARkS\nThe littlest Higgs model is an extension of the standard model which provides a solution to the hierarchy problem by introducing a heavy scalar particle [1] .\nIn this work we consider the littlest Higgs theory with T-parity [2] , where the lightest T-even state h' has properties similar to those of the SM Higgs boson [3] . The main difference lies in its couplings to fermions [4] : while the coupling strength of the SM-like Higgs boson H to down-type quarks scales proportional to their masses mq, the corresponding coupling of h' scales proportional to 1\/mt, where mt denotes the mass of the top quark [5] . This leads to different rates for processes involving bottom and charm quarks [6] . As a consequence, the predicted values for certain observables differ significantly from the ones obtained in the SM [7, 8] . For example, the branching ratio BR(K + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03bd\u03bd) = 3.2 \u00d7 10 \u221210 [9] is enhanced compared to the SM prediction [10] BR(K + \u2192\u03c0 + \u03bd\u03bd)= 2.4\u00d710 \u221211 [11] due to the fact that the CKM matrix element |Vtd| is larger than expected [12] . On the contrary, the branching ratio BR(\nis suppressed because it depends quadratically on Vtd [13] . Another interesting feature of the LHT is the possibility to generate CP violation at tree level [14] . It"}
{"text":"We present new results for light element abundances (Li, Be and B) in two metal-poor stars belonging to the Galactic Globular Cluster M4. The observed abundance patterns are compared with predictions based on standard Big Bang Nucleosynthesis theory as well as those obtained by assuming that these elements were produced during hydrostatic burning phases in massive AGB stars. We find that both scenarios fail to reproduce simultaneously all three measured elemental ratios at metallicities below [Fe\/H] = -2.0 dex. This suggests that additional processes must be responsible for producing LiBeB in this cluster.  These findings provide important clues about the origin of light elements in low-metallicity environments such as dwarf galaxies or primordial gas clouds. In particular, they suggest that the production mechanisms may have been different than previously thought. Finally, we discuss possible implications of our results for the formation history of globular clusters."}
{"text":"We revisit the question whether or not there is an excess in cosmic ray flux near Supernova Remnant (SNR) shells, as reported by PAMELA and AMS-02 experiments. We find that this excess can be explained within uncertainties if one assumes that SNRs accelerate particles with a power law spectrum up to energies above 10^15 eV. The required spectral index for protons is 2.2 +\/- 0.1 which agrees well with theoretical expectations based on diffusive shock acceleration theory. For electrons we require a harder spectrum with a slope of 3.0 +\/- 0.3. This result implies that either the electron-to-proton ratio decreases rapidly at high energy or that most of the observed CREs are secondary products produced via interactions between accelerated hadrons and background gas. In addition, our results suggest that the total number density of CRs around SNRs should be higher than previously estimated."}

The first systematic study was carried out by Blazhko himself who found that about half of all known RR Lyr show this phenomenon. In recent decades many efforts have been made to understand its origin but no satisfactory explanation exists yet. \n \n We present here new results obtained with the WET collaboration during two observing runs in 2002 and 2004. Our data cover almost ten years of observations which allow us to investigate the Blazhko effect over an unprecedentedly large time span. This allows us to determine the mean period change rate as well as the amplitude modulation properties of RR Gem II. These are compared with those derived for other Blazhko-modulated RR Lyr. \nWe find that our results agree very well with previous studies."}

The results are applied to study the statistical properties of nodal lines on the surface of oceanic internal tides.

{"text":"The Wang-Landau (WL) algorithm is used in this work as an efficient tool to explore the low energy conformation space of proteins and predict their native structures. The WL method has been successfully applied to many systems, such as spin glasses, lattice gas models, protein folding problems etc., but it was never tested on realistic biomolecular systems before. In our study we have performed extensive tests with different types of proteins using both coarse-grained and all-atom force fields. We show that the WL sampling can be efficiently combined with standard Monte Carlo simulations or Molecular Dynamics runs at high temperatures. This allows us to obtain accurate estimates of free energies even when only relatively short trajectories are available. Our results demonstrate that the WL approach provides very good agreement between predicted and experimental structures. Finally, we discuss possible applications of the proposed methodology to other complex systems where the exploration of phase spaces plays important role."}
{"text":"We present the results of searches for gravitational wave signals from compact binary coalescences (CBCs) using data collected by the third and fourth science runs (S3, S4) of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). We use two different search methods to look for CBCs: an unmodeled matched filter method that is sensitive to all possible source orientations; and a modeled template bank method which uses templates based on post-Newtonian expansions of general relativity. The latter method has higher sensitivity but only covers certain regions of parameter space. In this work we report upper limits on the rate density of CBC events as a function of chirp mass and total mass. These are derived under the assumption that the observed event rates follow Poisson statistics with no background noise. For both search methods, our most stringent upper limit is obtained at high masses where the signal-to-noise ratio decreases rapidly due to detector antenna response functions."}
{"text":"The present work is devoted to the study of some aspects of geometry and topology in relativistic cosmology, with particular emphasis on the role played by the Weyl tensor. In Section 2 we review the basic concepts of Riemannian geometry that are relevant for our purposes; in particular, we introduce the concept of conformal vector field as well as its associated energy-momentum tensor. We also discuss how these fields can be used to construct exact solutions of Einstein's equations describing homogeneous but anisotropic universes. In Section 3 we consider the problem of classifying all possible types of singularities which may occur at finite time in spatially closed Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) models. This classification turns out to depend crucially upon whether or not the universe contains any matter sources other than radiation. Finally, in Section 4 we show that the presence of a non-vanishing Weyl tensor leads to an additional type of singularity which cannot arise if one assumes that the universe consists only of ordinary matter."}

This behavior is explained on the basis of the hopping conduction mechanism which dominates the transport process across grain boundaries. \n \n Keywords: Impedance Spectroscopy, Thermal conductivity, Electrical resistivity, BaTiO3 ceramic. Introduction: In recent years there has been growing interest in developing high performance materials for use in electronic devices such as sensors [1] , transducers [2] , microelectronic circuits [3] . These applications require materials having low thermal conductivities [4] , large dielectric constants [5] , small dielectric losses [6] , and high Curie temperatures [7] .\nBaTiO3 is one of these promising materials because it exhibits ferroelectricity [8] , piezoelectricity [9] , pyroelectricity [10] , and photocatalytic activity [11] . It also shows good chemical stability [12] , biocompatibility [13] , optical transparency [14] , and relatively low cost [15] . However, its poor sinterability [16] limits its application [17] . To overcome this problem, several methods have been developed including mechanical alloying [18] , spark plasma sintering [19] , microwave assisted sintering [20] , hydrothermal synthesis [21] , sol-gel processing [22] , etc [23] ."}
{"text":"We present constrained realizations of the mass distribution in the nearby universe, based on the Millennium Run N-body simulation (Springel et al., 2005) combined with galaxy redshift surveys. We use two different methods to construct mock catalogues for comparison with observations: The first method is based on the conditional luminosity function formalism developed by Yang et al. (2003) , which we apply to galaxies selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 (Abazajian et al., 2009 ). In this approach, each galaxy has an assigned halo mass drawn from its luminosity-dependent probability density function. The second method uses the Halo Occupation Distribution model introduced by Zheng et al. (2005) . Here, the number of central and satellite galaxies within haloes are determined using their respective HODs as functions of host halo mass. For both approaches, we compare our results against observational data sets including the 2MASS Redshift Survey (Huchra et al., 2012; Bilicki & Chodorowski, 2013), 6dF Galaxy Survey (Jones et al., 2004 ) and the WiggleZ Dark Energy Survey (Drinkwater et al., 2010)."}
{"text":"In this work, we propose an energy-efficient cooperative transmission scheme for wireless sensor networks (WSNs). The proposed scheme is based on the combination of collaborative beamforming at the source node with cooperative transmission to multiple relay nodes. In particular, by exploiting channel state information (CSI) feedbacks from all the relays, the source can adjust its transmit power level according to the instantaneous CSI so as to maximize the total network lifetime while satisfying certain quality-of-service requirements. We first derive closed-form expressions for the optimal power allocation between the source and each relay under different system settings. Then, using these results, we formulate the problem of maximizing the WSN's lifetime subject to minimum data rate constraints into a convex optimization framework which can be efficiently solved numerically. Finally, simulation results are presented to verify our theoretical analysis and demonstrate that significant performance gains over conventional schemes can be achieved through the use of the proposed approach."}
{"text":"We consider an entropy penalization method in order to estimate the density function f of a random variable X with values on Rd . We prove that, under some conditions, this estimator is strongly consistent and we study its asymptotic normality. The main tool used here is the exponential decay of correlations property satisfied by the stochastic process associated to our estimation procedure. This result allows us to obtain rates of convergence for the mean integrated squared error (MISE) between the true density f and its estimators. Finally, numerical experiments are performed in dimension 1 and 2. Keywords: Density estimation, Entropic penalty, Exponential decay of correlations, Asymptotic normality. Mathematics Subject Classification (2010): 60C05, 60F10, 62G20. 1 Introduction Let X be a real-valued random vector defined on a probability space (\u03a9 , A , P). In many applications such as signal processing or econometrics, it may be interesting to recover the distribution law of X denoted by fX . For example, if one wants to detect changes in the statistical properties of X over time, then knowing fX will allow him\/her to perform change-point detection tests [see e.g., Chen et al. (2013), Fryzlewicz & Subba Rao (2014)]. However, recovering fX can be difficult because only n iid observations X1 , . . . , Xn of X are available. To overcome this difficulty, several authors have proposed to use nonparametric methods based on kernel smoothing techniques [see e.g. , Silverman (1981) , Wand & Jones (1995) ]. More precisely, let K : R \u2192 [0, 1] be a given kernel function satisfying certain regularity assumptions which will be specified later.

{"text":"We present an analysis of the dependence on energy and luminosity of the frequencies of two types of quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) observed in the power density spectra of accreting black holes, namely low frequency QPOs (LFQPOs; 0.1-10 Hz), which are thought to be related to global properties of the flow close to the central object, and high frequency QPOs (HFQPOs; 10-100 Hz). We use data obtained with RXTE\/PCA for four sources: GRO J1655-40, XTE J1550-564, 4U 1543-47 and H 1743-322.  The LFQPO is modelled as arising due to non-linear coupling between radial epicyclic motion at different radii within the disc. This model predicts that the centroid frequency should scale inversely proportional to the square root of the photon energy. In contrast, we find that this scaling relation does not hold when considering HFQPOs. Instead, our results suggest that these features arise due to non-linear coupling between vertical epicyclic motions at different heights above the equatorial plane."}
{"text":"In this work, we propose an energy-efficient cooperative transmission scheme for wireless sensor networks (WSNs). The proposed scheme is based on the combination of collaborative beamforming at the source node with cooperative transmission to multiple relay nodes in order to improve lifetime performance. In particular, the source node first transmits data packets using its maximum power level. Then, it switches to lower power levels if no packet has been successfully received within a certain time period. If one or more packets are successfully decoded, then the source node increases its transmit power back up to the previous value. We derive closed-form expressions for outage probability as well as average throughput under Rayleigh fading channels. Our results show that our proposed scheme can significantly increase network lifetime compared to conventional schemes without compromising system reliability. Finally, numerical examples are provided to verify the theoretical analysis. Keywords: Lifetime improvement; Relay selection; Energy efficiency; Outage probability"}

We show how to compute this expression efficiently using O((n log n)(log log n)) arithmetic operations and storage space by combining fast polynomial multiplication algorithms with ideas from number theory.   Our approach relies on the fact that we are able to evaluate all minors simultaneously at any point x \u2208 [0, 1] using only O((n log n) (log log n))) arithmetic operations and storage space.

{"text":"In this work, we propose cooperative transmission protocols for wireless networks using multiuser detection (MUD) at the relay node to improve spectral efficiency as well as diversity order. The proposed schemes are based on network coding techniques that allow multiple users in the system to share the same time-frequency resources by exploiting spatial multiplexing gain. We first consider an amplify-and-forward protocol where each user transmits its signal simultaneously over different antennas while the relay performs MUD before forwarding it to all other users. Then, we extend our analysis to decode-and forward scheme which allows us to achieve higher data rates than those achieved by amplify-and-forward scheme. Finally, we derive closed-form expressions for outage probability and ergodic capacity under Rayleigh fading channels. Our results show that the proposed schemes can significantly enhance both spectral efficiency and diversity order compared to conventional non-cooperative systems.

{"text":"We study the phenomenology of string compactifications with large extra dimensions, focusing on supersymmetric particles in the mass range accessible to current experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). We consider two classes of models that are motivated by recent developments in string theory: weakly coupled heterotic orbifolds and strongly coupled Type IIB orientifold constructions. In both cases we find that there is an interesting interplay between the Kaluza-Klein excitations associated with the extra dimensions and the lightest Standard Model superpartners. For example, in some regions of parameter space it may be possible to produce gluinos or squarks directly via Drell-Yan processes; alternatively, these states can decay into lighter Standard Model superpartners which then cascade down to the LSP neutralino. The resulting collider signatures depend sensitively on the details of the underlying model parameters as well as the number of extra dimensions."}
{"text":"In this work, we study the problem of distributed estimation over sensor networks with energy constraints. We consider two different models for communication between sensors: (i) broadcast model where each node can communicate directly to all other nodes; and (ii) gossip model where only pairwise communications are allowed. In both cases, we assume that there is no centralized fusion center collecting data from individual nodes. Instead, each node collects information locally by communicating with its neighbors and performs local processing on received messages before forwarding them further. The goal is to minimize the total number of transmissions required to achieve an accurate estimate at every node. For both models, we propose efficient algorithms which provide provable guarantees on accuracy as well as energy efficiency.

{"text":"We study the propagation of external control signals through a large class of randomly constructed Boolean networks, which are known to exhibit rich dynamical behaviors including chaos.  We show that for any given initial state, there exists an optimal set of input nodes such that if their states are fixed at 1 or 0, then the resulting system will reach its steady state with minimum number of steps (or equivalently maximum speed). The problem is formulated as finding this optimal set of input nodes by solving a combinatorial optimization problem on graphs. This formulation leads us to develop efficient algorithms based on local search techniques. Our results provide insights into how to design effective control strategies for complex systems modeled by Boolean networks. In addition, we also investigate the effect of noise on the performance of these control strategies. Finally, our analysis reveals some interesting connections between the structure of the underlying graph and the effectiveness of different control strategies.

{"text":"We consider a generalization of the Freedman-Townsed model in which there are two types of agents, and each agent has an endowment that is either divisible or indivisible.  We show how to compute equilibria for this game using linear programming techniques.

This extends previous results on the same problem by Daskalakis et al. (2007) who considered only the case where all goods were indivisible. The main idea behind our approach is to use a new formulation of the equilibrium conditions as a system of equations with integer coefficients.

{"text":"In this work, we investigate the trade-offs among processing gains and timing jitters for impulse radio ultra-wideband (IR-UWB) systems with different pulse shapes. We first derive closed-form expressions to calculate the bit error rate (BER), which is used as performance measure. Then, by using these results, we analyze how the BER changes according to various system parameters such as signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), number of pulses per symbol, and timing jitter variance. Finally, numerical examples are provided to verify our analysis. The main contributions of this study can be summarized as:  1 . Derivation of closed-form expression for calculating the BER.  2 . Analysis on the effect of timing jitter on IR-UWB systems.  3 . Numerical verification of analytical results. In recent years, there has been growing interest in developing high data-rate wireless communication systems that operate over unlicensed bands [1] , especially those based on impulse radio ultrawideband (IR-UWB: [2] ). Compared to conventional narrowband systems, IR-UWB systems have several advantages including low power consumption [3] , immunity against multipath fading [4] , and high security [5] .\nHowever, one major drawback of IR-UWB systems is their vulnerability to timing jitter [6] - [8] . This problem arises because the received signals may experience time delays due to channel dispersion or clock imperfections at both transmitter and receiver sides [9] . As a result, the transmitted symbols cannot be recovered correctly if they arrive out of phase [10] . Therefore, it is important to understand the effects of timing jitter on the performance of IR-UWB systems [11] .\nTo address this issue, many studies have investigated the impact of timing jitter on various aspects of IR-UWB systems [12]- [16] . For example, in [13] , the authors analyzed the effect of timing jitters on the energy efficiency of IR-UWB systems. They showed that the energy efficiency decreases when the timing jitter increases.

{"text":"In this work we study the complexity of Villamayor\u2019s algorithm for computing Gr\u00f6bner bases, when applied to an ideal generated by polynomials with only one variable and no multiple variables. We show that if the input is not exceptional then the number of steps performed by the algorithm is bounded above by $O(n^2)$ where $n$ denotes the degree of the polynomial ring. This bound improves upon the previously known upper bounds which were exponential or doubly exponential in terms of the degrees of the generators. The proof uses techniques from computational algebraic geometry such as elimination theory and Macaulay matrices. In particular it relies on the fact that the initial ideals are Cohen-Macaulay modules over the residue field. As a consequence our result also implies that the Buchberger algorithm has quadratic worst-case running time under these assumptions. Finally, using recent results about the complexity of linear algebra algorithms, we prove that the total bit-complexity of the algorithm is $O(n^4 \\log n)$."}

The OFC is stabilized to a high-finesse cavity and locked to a narrow linewidth laser at 1083 nm, which serves as a local oscillator. We show that this system can be used to measure the absolute frequencies of two transitions in helium with uncertainties below 100 kHz. This will allow us to determine the fine-structure constant \u03b1 with relative uncertainty better than 2\u00d710\u221210 by measuring the ratio between these two frequencies. In addition we demonstrate how the same setup could be used to perform tests of fundamental physics beyond the Standard Model such as searches for time variation of fundamental constants or violations of Lorentz invariance. Optical frequency combs are powerful tools for precise metrology [1\u20133] . They have been successfully applied to many different fields including ultra-stable lasers [4] , gravitational wave detection [5] , and quantum optics [6] .\nIn particular they provide unprecedented possibilities for high-precision measurement [7\u20139] .

{"text":"We report on the detection of suppressed radio emission in two interacting galaxy clusters, Abell 2146 and Abell 2390 (z = 0.23). The cluster pair is part of an extended X-ray filamentary structure that extends over ~30 Mpc along the line-of-sight. We find that the fraction of radio-detected galaxies decreases with increasing projected distance to the nearest cluster center for both clusters individually as well as when combining all galaxies within the entire filamentary structure. This trend cannot be explained by differences in stellar mass or SFR between galaxies located at different distances from their host cluster centers. Instead we argue that it can be understood if the gas density increases towards the cluster cores due to gravitational compression and\/or shock heating during cluster mergers. In this case, the increased ram pressure would suppress star formation activity in galaxies residing close to the cluster core. Our results are consistent with previous studies showing that the fraction of star-forming galaxies decreases rapidly with decreasing cluster-centric radius."}

We assume that all nodes have identical observations corrupted by additive noise whose variance is known at every node. The goal is then to find out how many bits are required per sample so as to ensure that the estimation error decays exponentially fast (in terms of number of samples) when averaged over all possible realizations of the network topology. This problem has been studied extensively under various settings such as Gaussian or Bernoulli random graphs. In particular, we focus on the case where the underlying graph is a tree. For this model, we show that if the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is sufficiently large, then there exists a universal constant c > 0 independent of the tree structure such that any algorithm requires at least $(c \\log n)$ bits\/sample to achieve exponential decay of the average estimation error.

We show that the current noise is suppressed by increasing transparency between the leads or decreasing temperature. The suppression can be explained as due to an increase of the effective junction length caused by Andreev reflection at the interface. In addition we find that the shot-noise power decreases when the phase difference across the junction increases. This effect originates from the dependence of the density of states on the phase difference. Finally, we discuss how our results are related to recent experiments performed on diffusive SNS junctions. \nI.

Such systems are known as diffusive SNS junctures [4] . They exhibit interesting phenomena such as the proximity effect [5] , which causes the formation of a minigap inside the N region [6] . Another important feature of these devices is their ability to carry both charge and spin currents [7, 8] . These properties make them promising candidates for applications ranging from quantum information processing [9] to magnetic field sensing [10] .\nRecently there has been renewed interest in studying the physics of diffusive SNS juncture [11] - [16] .

The temperature of each blackbody function decreases as the emission radius increases. This behavior is consistent with theoretical predictions for photospheric emission from relativistic outflows. In addition to this thermal component, we also detect non-thermal emission above 100 MeV.

{"text":"We present an analysis of anisotropies in satellite galaxy locations around isolated galaxies, using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We find that satellites are preferentially located along the major axes of their hosts and show no preference for being aligned with minor axes or random directions. This result is robust against variations in host luminosity, color, morphology, environment density, and redshift range. The observed alignment between satellites and major axes persists even when we restrict our sample to only those satellites which have been accreted most recently by their hosts. These results suggest that dark matter halos may be triaxial ellipsoids whose orientations align with the shapes of their central galaxies. In addition, we find evidence that this effect increases as one moves towards lower mass systems. Our findings provide new constraints on models of galaxy formation and evolution. Using data from the Sloan Digitial Sky Survey (SDSS), we study the distribution of satellite galaxies around isolated galaxies. We find that satellites are more likely to lie along the major axes of the hosts than they are to lie along either the minor axes or randomly oriented lines through space.

{"text":"The main result is that if we have an infinite product of finite number fields, then it can be written as a sum over primes in those number fields.  This theorem has been used to prove many results about prime numbers including the Prime Number Theorem for arithmetic progressions (PNTAP) which states that the density of primes in any arithmetic progression equals 1 \/ li(n), where n is the common difference between consecutive terms of the progression.   The PNTAP was first proved by Chebyshev using analytic methods but this proof does not give information on how large the primes are or what their distribution looks like.    We will also discuss some applications of our theorem such as proving the existence of infinitely many primes with certain properties. In this lecture I will talk about my recent work on finite Euler products and its connection to the Riemann hypothesis. First let me define what a finite Euler product is:  Let K be a number field, i.e., a finite extension of Q. Then we say that f = \\prod_{P \\in S}f_P$ is a finite Euler product over $K$ iff:   $f_P$ is a rational function in $P - 1$, $|S| < \\infty$,   $f$ converges absolutely for all $\\Re(s) > 0$,  If $s = \\sigma + it$ satisfies $\\sigma > 1$, then there exists a constant $C > 0$ so that: $$ |f(\\sigma+it)| \\leq C t^{-\\sigma}$$ Here $S$ denotes the set of primes in $K$. Now let's see why these conditions make sense intuitively. For example, if you take $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, then the only prime in $K$ is 2. So if we want to write down a finite Euler product over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) = \\{a + b \\sqrt{2}\\mid a,b \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\}$, then we should just look at the factorization of polynomials into irreducible factors modulo 2:  $$\\prod_{P\\in S}f_P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\left(1 - \\frac{x^{2^n}}{2^{n+1}}\\right).$$"}
{"text":"G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are one of the largest families of cell surface proteins and play an important role in many physiological processes, including vision, olfaction, taste, hormone secretion, neurotransmission, immune response, inflammation, and cancer.  The number of known human GPCR sequences has increased dramatically over recent years due to advances in genome sequencing technologies; however, only about half have been functionally characterized so far. In this study we present a novel computational method that can be used to predict the functional class of uncharacterized GPCRs based on their sequence similarity with other members within each subfamily. Our approach is based on two key ideas: 1) We use a new adaptive strategy to select representative sequences from different subfamilies by considering both the diversity among them as well as their evolutionary relationships; 2) We develop a new scoring scheme which takes into account not only the pairwise sequence similarities but also the structural information between query and template sequences. Using our method, we were able to successfully classify more than 80% of all human GPCRs whose functions had previously been experimentally determined."}
{"text":"We present the results on the distribution and luminosity function (LF) of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in clusters of galaxies based on Chandra observations of 16 galaxy clusters at redshifts 0.1 < z < 1.0. We find that the fraction of X-ray luminous AGNs increases with redshift, but decreases with cluster mass. The LF of AGNs is well described by a power law with an exponential cutoff above Lx = 1043 erg s-1 Hz-1 . The best-fit parameters are consistent with those found for field AGNs within their uncertainties. These results suggest that AGNs play important roles in heating intracluster gas as well as regulating star formation activities in clusters.

The resulting algorithm is shown to have optimal convergence rates under certain conditions. In particular it has been proved recently that if the coefficients of the expansion are chosen optimally then the rate of convergence is O(N^{-2}), where N denotes the number of terms used in the expansion. \nThe main purpose of this thesis was to implement these algorithms numerically and compare their performance against other existing techniques such as Chebyshev expansions or Legendre expansions.

The main purpose of this study was to find out how much energy would be needed to build such a tower with different materials.  In order to do that we used two methods - one analytical method based on the theory of elasticity and another numerical method using finite element analysis software ANSYS. We found out that the optimal material should have high strength but low density. It turned out that carbon nanotubes are very good candidates as they can reach extremely high strengths while having relatively small densities. This work will help us design better space elevators in the future.

However none of these designs managed to become fully functional [5] . One of the reasons why it is so difficult to build a working space elevator is because its weight limit is determined by the maximum static load [6] . If the weight exceeds this value then the cable will sag under gravity [7] . Another problem is that the cables need to support their own weight [8] . Therefore if you want to make your space elevator lighter than air [9] , you must use some kind of counterweight [10] ."}
{"text":"We report on helioseismic observations made by GOLF and MDI instruments aboard SOHO spacecraft during the largest recorded solar flare in recent years, which occurred on 2005 Jan. 15 (Solar Flare Event #11). The event produced an intense seismic signal with a duration of about 20 minutes that was detected simultaneously at two different frequencies corresponding to acoustic waves traveling along opposite directions across the Sun's surface. We find that this signal is consistent with a source located near the center of the active region NOAA 10486 where the flare took place. This result suggests that the energy released by the flare may have been channeled into the generation of strong toroidal magnetic fields through the action of plasma flows driven by the Lorentz force. These results are discussed within the framework of current models for solar flares. \n \n Keywords: Solar flare, seismology, sunquake \n \n 1 Introduction \n \n Intense solar flares can release huge amounts of energy over very short timescales. It has recently become possible to study these events using space-based observatories such as the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) [1] . During large solar flares, it is often observed that there is a significant increase in the intensity of the photospheric Doppler velocity field [2] , which indicates that the photosphere undergoes rapid motions associated with the eruption of coronal mass ejections [3] . However, the exact physical mechanisms responsible for driving these phenomena remain poorly understood [4] .\n \nIn addition to their effects on the photospheric flow velocities, solar flares also produce powerful seismic signals known as \"sunquakes\" [5] . These signals were first discovered by Leighton et al [6] who used ground-based measurements of the Doppler shift of the Fraunhofer lines in the visible spectrum of sunlight reflected off the Moon. Since then, several other groups [7, 8] have reported similar detections based on data obtained either from ground-based or spacebased telescopes operating in various parts of the electromagnetic spectrum [9] .

{"text":"We present the results on the metallicity distribution functions (MDFs) for stars at different latitudes and distances from the Galactic plane, based on spectroscopic data obtained by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We find that MDFs are similar to each other within errors except those at |b| > 30\u00b0 where there is an excess of metal-poor stars compared to the disk population. The fraction of metal-poor stars increases towards higher latitude. This suggests that the halo component becomes more dominant as one goes farther away from the Galactic plane. In addition we also found that the mean metallicities decrease slightly toward larger distance from the Galactic center. These findings suggest that the outer part of our Galaxy has been formed through accretion processes. \n \n Keywords: Metallicity Distribution Function; Halo; Disk; High Latitude Stars; Sloan Digital Sky Survey \n \n 1 Introduction \n \n It is well known that the Milky Way consists of three main components -the thin disk, thick disk and halo. However, it remains unclear how these components were assembled during its formation history. To understand this process, it is important to study their chemical compositions separately because they may have experienced different evolutionary histories. For example, the age-metallicity relation shows that the halo was formed earlier than the disk(e.g., Twarog 1980), while the abundance ratios such as [Fe\/H] show that the halo contains many old low-mass stars which should be destroyed by supernova explosions if the halo had been formed recently like the disk(e. g., Nissen & Schuster 1997). \n \n Many studies have investigated the properties of the halo using various samples of distant halo stars selected mainly from proper motion surveys or photometric parallax measurements. Recently, large spectroscopic surveys such as the Sloan Digital Sky Surveys (SDSS) (York et al. 2000) , RAVE survey (Steinmetz 2003 )and SEGUE survey (Yanny et al. 2009 )have provided us with much better information about the chemical composition of the halo.

{"text":"We report on the detection of transient X-ray emission in normal galactic nuclei (NGNs) with Chandra and XMM-Newton observatories, which is likely to be associated with accretion onto supermassive black holes at their centers. The observed luminosities are consistent with those expected for steady nuclear activity powered by mass inflow through an optically thick disk around the central black hole. We find that the duration of this activity ranges between 10 3 -10 5 years, depending on the distance of NGN from Earth. This suggests that the majority of NGNs may have experienced such active phases during their lifetimes. Our results also imply that the current quiescent state of most NGNs could be due to either low-level accretion or obscuration effects.

However, it suffers from the so-called \"sign problem\": the fermion determinant detDm=exp[-tr{Dm}lnm] changes its signs depending on the gauge configurations [2] , where Dm denotes the Wilson-Dirac operator [3] . Therefore, Monte Carlo methods cannot be directly employed to calculate physical quantities using LQCD because they require positive definite weight functions [4] .\nIn order to overcome this difficulty, several approaches have been developed so far [5] - [8] . Among them, the Taylor expansion approach [9] - [11] seems to be very powerful since it allows us to evaluate the expectation value of any observables accurately within statistical errors. It also enables us to perform calculations at high temperature and\/or high density [12] - [14] . For example, the Taylor expansion up to O(a6) has already been performed successfully [15] ."}

{"text":"We present new results on the properties of diffuse radio emission associated with galaxy clusters, based on observations carried out at 1.4 GHz using the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT). We have studied the correlation between the total power of the diffuse radio emission and other physical parameters such as X-ray luminosity, temperature and mass for a sample of 25 galaxy clusters observed by GMRT. The main result is that we find evidence for two different populations of radio halo sources which are separated by their radio powers. In particular, our analysis shows that there exists an upper limit to the radio power of radio halos hosted by massive galaxy clusters. This suggests that the energy density of relativistic particles responsible for the synchrotron emission decreases rapidly beyond this threshold value. Our findings also suggest that the magnetic field strength increases with increasing radio power. These results can be explained within the framework of the re-acceleration model where secondary electrons produced through hadronic interactions are reaccelerated by turbulence generated during mergers or accretion events."}

However, most of these works were based on the assumption that the system under consideration is always close to equilibrium [9] . As a result they cannot describe correctly some important features observed experimentally [10] . For example, the shape of the TSL glow curve depends strongly on the type of material [11] : while in insulators it usually exhibits a single peak [12] , in metals it often consists of several peaks [13] .

{"text":"We present an overview on supersymmetric grand unified theories (SUSY-GUT), their connection to neutrino masses via seesaw mechanisms as well as dark matter candidates in these models. We discuss how GUT scale physics can be probed at future colliders such as LHC or ILC. Finally we give some examples for specific realizations within SO(10) and E6 gauge groups. Supersymmetry is one of the most promising extensions beyond the Standard Model which addresses many open questions like the hierarchy problem between electroweak and Planck scales, unification of forces etc.. In addition it provides a natural candidate for cold dark matter -the lightest neutralino. The minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) has been studied extensively over the last two decades but suffers from several shortcomings. One of them is that the MSSM does not provide any explanation why there are three generations of quarks and leptons with different quantum numbers. Grand Unified Theories (GUTs) address this issue by postulating that all known particles including those of the third generation belong to multiplets of larger symmetry group than SU(3)xSU(2)xU(1). This leads naturally to relations among coupling constants and fermion mass matrices. Another shortcoming of the MSSM is that it cannot explain small neutrino masses observed experimentally. However, if R-parity is broken then Majorana neutrinos may acquire tiny masses through see-saw mechanism. These new states could also contribute significantly to the relic density of dark matter."}

In addition, it has been shown [2] that these observations are consistent with predictions based on slow-roll models [3] , where the energy density decreases slowly during inflation due to friction-like effects [4] .\nIn order to explain why such a period of rapid expansion occurred, one usually invokes a scalar field called \"inflaton\" whose potential V(\u03c6) drives inflation when it becomes flat enough [5] . However, there exists no compelling theoretical reason for choosing any particular form for V(\u03c6). For example, if we assume that V(\u03c6) = m 2 \u03c6 2 \/2 + \u03bb\u03c6 4 \/4!, then the resulting dynamics will depend crucially on whether or not the mass term dominates over the quartic self-interaction [6] .

We find that these clouds can cool efficiently by atomic hydrogen lines only if they have metallicities above Z = 1e-6Z_eq or higher. This is because metal enrichment increases the cooling rate through fine-structure emission lines such as [CII] 158um and [OI] 63um. The virialized gas inside minihalos has lower metallicity than its surrounding intergalactic medium due to inefficient mixing caused by supersonic turbulence driven by supernova explosions.

These results suggest that the scaling behavior of these surfaces may not depend solely on the chemical composition but also depends strongly on other factors such as the microstructure of the substrate materials used."}
{"text":"The aim of this study is to develop an improved model for simulating diffusion processes within biological cells, especially those occurring at the nuclear membrane and its associated structures.  The proposed approach involves coupling two existing models; one that describes the movement of molecules through the cytoplasm (the fluid part of the cell) using Brownian dynamics simulations, with another which represents the nucleus as a porous medium containing immobile obstacles.  This latter component has been developed by considering the geometry of the nuclear pore complex network, which consists of cylindrical pores connected via narrower channels.   In order to validate our new hybrid model we have performed a series of numerical experiments on synthetic data generated from both individual particle tracking and Monte Carlo methods.  We find good agreement between these results and those obtained from our own computational scheme, thereby demonstrating the accuracy of our method. Finally, we apply our new modelling framework to investigate how changes in the structure of the nuclear pore complexes can affect the rate of molecular exchange across the nuclear envelope."}
{"text":"We present the results of an observation performed by XMM-Newton on the galaxy cluster Abell S0740 (SA57). The data were taken between December 2004 and January 2005 for a total exposure time of about 100 ks, split into two pointings separated by 1 arcmin. We detect more than 50 sources within the field-of-view of our observations. Most of them are associated to galaxies at different redshifts; we also find several active galactic nuclei (AGN) as well as one background quasar. In order to study their properties, we have extracted spectra for all detected sources using circular regions centered on each source position. For most of these objects, we could fit single power-law models or thermal plasma emission models. From this analysis, we derive luminosities ranging from 1042 erg s-1 up to 1044 erg s-1 . Using the observed fluxes and assuming that they follow a standard candle model, we estimate the number density distribution of clusters per unit volume as a function of redshift. This allows us to calculate the expected number of clusters above a given mass limit as a function of redshift and compare it with the predictions obtained from numerical simulations."}
{"text":"We study the dynamics and emission properties of advection dominated accretion flows (ADAFs) in which viscosity is caused by magnetic reconnections between field lines anchored to differentially rotating black holes. We find that, for reasonable values of parameters, such ADAFs can produce luminosities as high as those observed in quasars without violating any observational constraints on their mass inflow rates or temperatures at large radii. The main reason why our model works well is because it naturally produces an outflowing wind component whose kinetic energy flux greatly exceeds its thermal energy flux. This wind carries away most of the angular momentum so that the flow becomes nearly Keplerian near the black hole horizon. In addition, we show that this wind also provides enough pressure support against gravity to prevent the gas density from becoming too low there. Our results suggest that the winds produced by magnetized ADAF models may be responsible for driving powerful radio jets in active galactic nuclei."}
{"text":"We report on the detection and characterization of two new classes of radio sources in nearby star-forming regions, which we identify as candidate young stellar objects (YSOs). The first class consists of compact radio sources with flat or inverted spectral indices that are associated with infrared dark clouds (IRDCs); these may be either deeply embedded YSOs or free-free absorbed H II regions. The second class is comprised of extended radio sources with steep spectra that appear to be physically related to IRDCs; these could represent ionized outflows driven by massive protostellar jets. We also present evidence suggesting that some of our candidates are likely to be magnetically active stars. These results demonstrate how VLBI observations can be used to search for and characterize protostars at very early stages of their evolution. \n \n Keywords: Radio astronomy, Young stellar object, Infrared dark cloud, Magnetar, Coronal mass ejection"}
{"text":"The detection and study of cosmic rays is one of the main goals for imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs). The background produced by these events can be reduced using different techniques, such as cuts on shower parameters or image cleaning algorithms. In this work we present an alternative method to reduce the background based on machine learning techniques. We use Random Forest classifiers trained with simulated data to identify cosmic-ray images among all recorded IACT images. This approach allows us to obtain results similar to those obtained with other methods but at lower computational cost. Finally, we apply our technique to real data taken with HESS-II telescope during its first year of operation. Our analysis shows that it is possible to improve the quality of reconstructed gamma-ray showers while reducing the number of rejected hadronic showers. \n \n Keywords: Machine Learning; Cosmic Ray Identification; Image Cleaning; Gamma-ray Astrophysics; Hadronic Shower"}
{"text":"We study the phenomenology of single-sector supersymmetric models in which all superpartners are degenerate at tree level, but receive mass splittings through radiative corrections. We show that such models can be described by an effective field theory with only two parameters, one of which is fixed by requiring that the lightest neutralino have the correct relic density to explain dark matter. The other parameter controls the masses of the remaining sparticles; we find that these masses are typically within reach of current searches for supersymmetry at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In particular, we consider the case where the gravitino has a mass mG = O(10) GeV, as motivated by gauge mediation scenarios. For this range of gravitino masses, we demonstrate how our results may be used to interpret existing LHC data on gluinos and squarks. Finally, we discuss prospects for future LHC experiments."}
{"text":"We have studied the pulse-to-pulse intensity variations in two pulsars, PSR B0826-34 and PSR B1133+16, using data obtained with the Parkes radio telescope at 1.4 GHz (92cm) and 2.7GHz(36cm). We find that both pulsars show strong evidence for subpulse drift bands which are modulated by an underlying pattern of weaker emission. The observed patterns can be explained as due to interference between different modes of emission within each beam. In addition we find that there is no significant difference in the subpulse modulation properties when comparing observations made at 36cm and those made at 92cm. This suggests that the physical processes responsible for producing these phenomena operate over a wide range of frequencies. These results provide further support for the idea that the phenomenon known as drifting subpulses may arise through some form of plasma instability operating on the open field lines near the magnetic poles of neutron stars. \n \n Keywords: Pulsar"}
{"text":"The space of quantum theory representations of natural numbers is studied in the context of von Neumann algebras. The main results are as follows:  1) A representation of an infinite-dimensional von Neumann algebra on a separable Hilbert space can be extended to a faithful normal representation if it has no nontrivial invariant subspace.  2) Every finite von Neumann algebra admits a faithful normal representation on a separable Hilbert spaces with no nontrivial invariant subspaces.  3) If ${\\displaystyle {\\mathfrak {A}}}$ is a von Neumann algebra acting on a separable Hilbert spacenot necessarily finite dimensional - then there exists a unique maximal abelian von Neumann subalgebra ${\\displaystyle {\\mathfrak {N}}}$ such that every irreducible representation of ${\\displaystyle {\\mathfrak {{A}}}}$ which does not leave ${\\displaystyle {\\mathfrak {N}}}}$ invariant leaves some other abelian von Neumann subalgebras invariant. 4) For any von Neumann algebra ${\\displaystyle {\\mathfrak {a}}}}$ acting on a separable complex Hilbert space, we have ${\\displaystyle {\\mathfrak {b}}}={{\\mathfrak {a}}}\\oplus {\\mathfrak {c}}^{\\ast }$ where ${\\displaystyle {\\mathfrak {c}}}$ denotes the commutant of ${\\displaystyle {\\mathsf {B}}}$."}
{"text":"We present sub-arcsecond resolution interferometric observations in the millimeter continuum, 12CO(J=1-0), 13CO(J=1-0) and C18O(J=1-0). We find that the molecular gas is distributed into two components with different kinematics. The main component has an extent of 1 kpc (0.5 arcsec at z = 2.3) and shows blueshifted emission on its eastern side and redshifted emission on its western side. This suggests that this component may be associated to outflowing material. A second component is detected only in 12CO(J=1-1) and it is located 0.2 arcsec eastward of the first one. It also shows blueshifted velocities but they are smaller than those observed for the main component. Both components show similar line widths suggesting that both have comparable dynamical masses. These results suggest that the bulk of the molecular gas is concentrated in these two components which could represent the progenitors of massive elliptical galaxies seen today. \n \n Keywords: Ultraluminous Infrared Galaxies"}
{"text":"We report on our search for planets transiting the debris disk host star AU Mic (M3V). We observed two transit events with Spitzer Space Telescope's IRAC camera at 3.6 and 4.5 microns in 2009-2010 using the same technique as described by Charbonneau et al. (2005) . The first event was detected only in one bandpass while the second event showed no evidence of a transit signal above the noise level. Using these data we place upper limits on the radius R p \/R s < 0.11 and mass m sin i < 1.1 MJup for any planet orbiting AU Mic within an orbital period P = 2 days.

{"text":"We present the results of numerical simulations aimed at studying the statistical properties of core lifetimes and their dependence on initial conditions for turbulent molecular clouds with magnetic fields exceeding the critical value for collapse by an order of magnitude or more.  We find that cores are born with a wide range of masses (from 0.1 to 10 solar masses) and sizes (from 1 AU to 1000 AU). The mass distribution is well described by a power law dN\/dm ~ m^{-3} over three orders of magnitude in mass. Cores live for times ranging between about one thousand years up to several million years. Most cores have lifetimes shorter than 100 000 yr but there exists a small fraction of very long-lived cores which can survive for as much as 5 Myr. These findings suggest that star formation may be episodic rather than continuous. In addition we show that the lifetime statistics depend strongly on the initial conditions chosen for our models."}
{"text":"The Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) is an evolutionary phase in which stars lose large amounts of mass, and are responsible for most dust production in galaxies. The exact mechanism by which this occurs remains unclear; however it has been suggested that pulsations play a key role.  In this work we present new observations of two evolved intermediate-mass stars with very different pulsation properties to investigate how their pulsational behaviour affects mass-loss rates. We find evidence that the star with higher amplitude pulsations loses more material than its less-pulsating counterpart. This suggests that high amplitudes may be required to drive significant mass loss during the AGB stage. However, our results also show that there appears to be no clear relationship between pulsation period or mode and mass loss rate. These findings have important implications for understanding the evolution of low-metallicity stars as well as the formation of planetary nebulae."}
{"text":"We study spectral fluctuations for large Hermitian tridiagonal matrices with independent entries distributed according to the beta distribution, which is a generalization of the Gaussian distribution. We show that these matrices belong to the so-called beta-Hermite ensemble and we compute their joint probability density function (jpdf) in terms of the Laguerre polynomials. The jpdf can be written as an infinite product over all possible values of the largest eigenvalue $\\lambda_1(M)$. This allows us to obtain exact expressions for the mean value $\\langle \\lambda_1 \\rangle$ and variance $\\sigma^2_1$ of this quantity. In particular, we find that the average number of eigenvalues inside any interval $[a,b]$ scales like $b-a$ when $a\\to 0$ or $b\\to\\infty$. Finally, we use our results to derive explicit formulas for the moments of the largest eigenvalue. These are compared against numerical simulations. \nI. INTRODUCTORY REMARK\nThe purpose of this work is twofold. On one hand, it provides new insights into the statistical properties of the spectrum of certain classes of random matrices. On the other hand, it also serves as a starting point towards the analysis of more complicated models such as those arising in quantum mechanics. Indeed, the class of random matrices considered here has been recently used by several authors to model the energy levels of disordered systems [1] . \nIn order to introduce some notation let us consider a sequence of N real numbers $x_n$, $n=1,...,N$, whose joint probability density function (PDF) reads $P(x_1,...,x_N)=P(x_1)P(x_2|x_1)...P(x_N|x_{N-1})$. If we now define the matrix $M=(m_{ij})$ where $m_{ij}=x_i-x_j$ then its PDF will read $P_M(M)=P(x_1)^{N-1}\\prod_{i<j} P(m_i-m_j)$. It turns out that if the variables $x_i$ have a common PDF $f(x)$ then the corresponding matrix $M$ belongs to what is known as the Wishart"}
{"text":"We study the thermal instability and fragmentation of an initially uniform, isothermal cloud embedded in a hot plasma flow with constant velocity shear using two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations. The initial temperature difference between the cloud and its surroundings leads to the development of Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities at the cloud boundary which grow into mushroom-like structures that are unstable against Kelvin-Helmholtz modes as well. We find that these two types of instabilities can lead to the formation of filaments and clumps within the cloud on different timescales depending on the strength of the magnetic field. In addition we show that heat conduction has only minor effects on the cloud's morphology but significantly influences the cloud's internal structure by smoothing out density fluctuations. Finally, we discuss how our results may be used to explain observations of cometary globules and other dense molecular clouds. Subject headings: Instability -Conductivity -Magnetic fields -Clouds"}
{"text":"We report on the discovery and spectroscopic confirmation of an extremely bright, strongly lensed galaxy at z = 3.1 (AB mag=18.6) found by searching for high-z galaxies behind Abell 1689 using the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS). The lensing cluster is known to have a large number of arcs produced by multiple images of background sources. We find that this object has six distinct components with similar colors and magnitudes which are aligned along a line-of-sight distance of ~2 arcmin. This system appears to be a multiply-imaged version of a single source whose intrinsic luminosity is comparable to those of the most luminous quasars currently known. The total flux density of all 6 components combined corresponds to a rest frame UV continuum luminosity of 1.5 x 10^26 W Hz^-1 or about 100 times brighter than any other known gravitationally-lensed galaxy."}
{"text":"The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is an ideal laboratory for studying Galactic structure, stellar populations, chemical evolution, and cosmology because it has many advantages over other nearby galaxies such as M31 or M33.  The distance to the LMC can be determined by using Cepheids which are bright periodic variable stars that pulsate in radial fundamental mode. In this study we used two different methods to determine distances to Cepheids in the LMC. First method was based on non-linear least squares fitting technique called testimator while second one was based on statistical analysis known as Schwarz information criterion (SIC). We found that both methods gave consistent results within their uncertainties. Our final sample consists of 1228 Cepheids located between 30 < R < 50 kpc from the center of the galaxy. Using these data sets we derived new period-luminosity relations for classical Cepheids in the infrared bands JHKs."}
{"text":"We consider the problem of sampling from an arbitrary probability distribution over graphs with fixed number of nodes and edges, where each node has a given degree constraint. We propose a novel algorithm for this task based on the idea of rapidly mixing Markov chains known as Metropolis-Hastings algorithms. Our approach is to use a special type of graph called a tree decomposition which allows us to decompose our original problem into smaller problems in such a way that we can efficiently sample from these smaller problems using existing techniques. In particular, we show how to construct a tree decomposition of any input graph G = (V , E) by first constructing a tree decomposition of its line graph L(G). Then, we prove that if there exists a polynomial time algorithm A that solves one of these small subproblems then it also implies the existence of a polynomial time algorithm B that solves all of them simultaneously. Finally, we present experimental results showing that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods when applied to several real-world datasets."}

{"text":"We present the luminosity function (LF) for galaxies in the local universe at rest-frame wavelengths between 3 and 24 microns, using data obtained with Spitzer Space Telescope's Infrared Array Camera (IRAC). We use two different methods to estimate the LF - one based on direct counts of galaxies within bins of absolute magnitude, and another that uses an analytic model fit to these galaxy counts. The results are consistent across both techniques. Our best-fit Schechter parameters are: M* = -19.6 +\/- 0.1 mag., log(L\/Lsun) * = 10.9 +\/- 0.2 dex, and alpha = -1.3 +\/- 0.4. These values agree well with previous determinations made by other authors over similar wavelength ranges. However, we find evidence for a significant excess number density of faint sources relative to predictions from our best-fit Schechte functions. This excess is most pronounced at longer wavelengths where it amounts to ~50% more objects than expected."}
{"text":"We present new ultraviolet (UV) observations of star formation rates (SFRs) for galaxies within 10 Mpc using GALEX data and compare these to SFRs derived from optical emission lines, infrared luminosities, radio continuum fluxes, and UV-optical colors. We find that all methods agree well with each other when applied to normal star-forming galaxies but disagree significantly on low-luminosity dwarf galaxies where dust extinction is significant. The scatter between different estimators increases at lower luminosities due primarily to differences in how they treat dust extinction. In addition we show that there are systematic offsets among some of the estimators which can be explained by aperture effects or calibration uncertainties. Finally, we use our sample to examine the relationship between galaxy mass and specific star formation rate as measured by various techniques. Our results suggest that the most reliable estimates of SFR come from combining multiple indicators rather than relying solely on one method."}
{"text":"We present new measurements of the mean and scatter in the velocity dispersion-optical richness relation (VRR) for galaxy clusters selected by their red-sequence galaxies using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 (SDSS DR7).

The discrepancies between our results and those presented in earlier works may be due to systematic effects associated with the measurement techniques used or could indicate evolution in the VRR over time. In either case, these results highlight the need for further investigation into this relationship as well as other scaling relations involving galaxy clusters. \n \n Keywords: galaxy cluster, optical richness"}
{"text":"We study entanglement properties of the Toric Code model in two dimensions, which is defined on a square lattice with periodic boundary conditions. We consider both ground state and thermal states for this system. In particular we calculate the von Neumann entropy S(A) = \u2212Tr\u03c1A ln \u03c1A associated to different regions A of the lattice as well as the mutual information I(A; B) between any pair of disjoint regions A and B. The results are compared against numerical simulations performed by means of Monte Carlo techniques. For the ground state it turns out that there exists an area law for the von Neumann entropy, i.e., S(A) \u221d L\u2212d\u22121 where d denotes the dimension of region A and L its linear size. Moreover, we find that the mutual information decays exponentially fast when one moves away from the diagonal line joining the centers of the regions A and B. These findings agree very well with those obtained using exact methods based on Matrix Product States (MPS). Finally, we also show how these results can be used to obtain bounds on the topological entropy of the Toric Code."}
{"text":"We present an atlas of the circumnuclear region (CNR) of 75 nearby active galactic nuclei observed by Hubble Space Telescope's Advanced Camera for Surveying program, which is part of the Nearby Galaxies Survey Treasury project. The CNRs are defined as the brightest central 2 kpc diameter circular aperture centered on each galaxy nucleus and were imaged using the F330W filter to select emission lines at wavelengths longer than 3000 \u00c5 . We use these data to study the properties of the nuclear starbursts that power the AGNs through their effects on the surrounding interstellar medium. In addition we examine how the physical conditions within the CNRs vary among different types of AGN activity.  We find that the majority of our sample have significant UV excesses over what would be expected based solely on stellar photospheric emission. This excess can be explained either by hot young stars or by dust extinction. For those objects where both optical spectroscopy and infrared imaging exist, we show that the UV excess is due primarily to dust extinction rather than hot young stars."}
{"text":"We present the results of our study on astrophysical accretion phenomena in black holes and neutron stars, which are considered to be analogues for gravitational wave sources such as binary black hole mergers or neutron star -black hole binaries. We have investigated how these systems can produce detectable signals at radio wavelengths by using numerical simulations with high spatial resolution. The main goal is to understand whether we could detect any signal associated with the merger process itself (i.e., before the final plunge) through observations of electromagnetic counterparts. In addition, we also studied the possibility that some of the observed gamma-ray bursts may originate from similar processes occurring in supermassive black holes. Our results show that there should exist observable signatures during the inspiral phase of the system evolution. These include quasi-periodic oscillations produced by the orbital motion of matter around the central compact object, and rapid changes in luminosity due to the interaction between the infalling gas stream and the surrounding disk."}
{"text":"We present an approach to predict the structural network organization in the cerebral cortex based on local node features, such as their position within the brain's surface or volume, and global topological characteristics. We use this method to study how different types of nodes are connected with each other across species (human, macaque monkey) and modalities (diffusion MRI tractography). Our results show that our model can accurately reproduce known patterns of cortico-cortical connections between areas, including those observed in humans but not yet described for monkeys. The proposed framework is general enough to be applied to any type of data where information about individual nodes' positions and pairwise interactions exists. This includes both anatomical and functional imaging datasets, which will allow us to investigate the relationship between structure and function at multiple scales. \n \n Introduction \n \n Brain connectomics aims to map all neuronal elements into a single comprehensive description of the human brain [1] . In recent years, advances in neuroimaging techniques have allowed researchers to obtain detailed maps of the brain's structural [2] , metabolic [3] , and functional [4] architecture. These new technologies provide unprecedented opportunities to understand how the brain works by studying its large-scale organization [5] .\n \nHowever, despite these advancements, there remains significant uncertainty regarding the precise nature of the relationships among neurons [6] . For example, it has been shown that some regions of the brain communicate more frequently than others [7-9], while others exhibit higher levels of synchrony [10] . However, we still do not know whether these differences reflect specific wiring rules [11] or simply arise due to random fluctuations [12] . \n \n Here, we propose a novel computational framework to address this problem using machine learning methods [13] . Specifically, we aim to develop models capable of predicting the strength of connection between pairs of nodes given only information about their location and topology [14] . To achieve this goal, we first construct a set of training examples consisting of pairs of nodes whose interaction strengths are known [15] . Then, we train a classifier to learn the mapping between node features and edge weights [16] . Finally, we apply the trained model to unseen test cases [17] to infer unknown interactions"}
{"text":"Spin echoes are observed when the spin system is subjected to two successive radio-frequency (RF) pulses separated by an interval, known as the pulse separation time Tsep. The first RF pulse creates a macroscopic magnetization vector M0 that precesses around the external magnetic field Bext at Larmor frequency fL = \u03b3Bext where \u03b3 is gyromagnetic ratio for nuclear spins. After the second RF pulse with flip angle \u03b82 and phase shift \u03c62 relative to the first one, the transverse component of the magnetization vector M2(t) decays exponentially due to dephasing caused by local magnetic fields created by neighboring nuclei. In this work we show how strong \u03c0-pulses can be used to generate spin echoes even if there is no net initial magnetization present before applying these pulses. We demonstrate theoretically and experimentally that such spin echoes originate intrinsically from the dipolar interactions between nuclear spins."}
{"text":"We study the disordering transitions in polydisperse particle systems with repulsive interactions by means of Monte Carlo simulations. We find that, for sufficiently large polydispersity index, there is no phase transition at all; instead we observe an increase of entropy as temperature decreases. For smaller values of the polydispersity index we find two different types of ordering transitions depending on whether or not particles are allowed to evaporate during cooling. In both cases we find evidence for a peak effect which can be explained within mean-field theory. The results presented here should also apply to other systems where evaporation plays a role such as colloidal suspensions. \n \n Introduction \n \n Disordered states play an important role in many physical phenomena ranging from glassy materials over granular matter to biological systems like proteins [1] . A common feature of these systems is their tendency towards ordering: At high temperatures they usually exhibit liquid-like behavior while below some critical temperature T c , they freeze into solid structures. This freezing process is accompanied by a discontinuous change of thermodynamic quantities (e.g., specific heat) signaling a first-order phase transition [2] .\n \nIn this work we consider disordered systems consisting of N interacting particles confined to a volume V . These particles may have different sizes and\/or charges leading to a distribution of interaction energies between them. As a result, even if the system has only one type of particles it will behave differently than a monodisperse system [3] . If the width of the size\/charge distribution becomes too large, however, the system loses its ability to form ordered phases altogether [4] . It then behaves more like a gas rather than a liquid [5] . \n \n Here we investigate how the presence of polydispersity affects the nature of the disordering transitions observed in these systems. To do so, we perform Monte Carlo simulations using a model introduced by Kob and Andersen [6] . Our main finding is that, for sufficiently large values of the polydisperisty index, there exists no phase transition at all but rather a continuous decrease of entropy upon decreasing temperature. On the other hand, for small enough polydispers"}
{"text":"We study the Casimir effect for fermions and scalars on an orbifolded six-dimensional space-time with nontrivial topology, which is obtained by compactifying M-theory on a Calabi-Yau threefold X times S 1 \/Z2. We find that the vacuum energy density depends only on the volume of X and not on its shape or size. This result can be understood as follows. The effective action contains terms proportional to the Euler characteristic of X, which are independent of the metric moduli. These terms cancel out when we take into account all Kaluza-Klein modes. In addition, there exist contributions coming from the winding states localized at fixed points of the orbifolding. However these contributions also vanish because they depend on the complex structure moduli of X, whose values cannot be determined within our framework. Finally, we show how this cancellation mechanism works explicitly using toric geometry techniques."}
{"text":"We study anisotropy in the ac response of mesoscopic superconducting films with respect to the direction of an applied magnetic field, using numerical simulations based on the quasiclassical theory for disordered metals and the Usadel equations. We find that the magnitude of the real part of the complex conductivity tensor is strongly dependent upon the angle between the current density vector and the external magnetic field. The imaginary part of the complex conductivity shows no such dependence. This behavior can be understood by considering the effect of the magnetic field on the distribution function of Andreev bound states. Our results are relevant to experiments performed on thin film structures where the transport properties depend sensitively on the orientation of the sample relative to the applied magnetic field. \n \n Mesoscopic superconductor systems have been studied extensively over recent years due to their potential applications as quantum devices [1-3]. In particular, there has been considerable interest in understanding how these systems respond to time-dependent perturbations [4] . For example, it was recently shown experimentally [5] , that when a dc bias voltage Vdc = 0 is applied across a Josephson junction array (JJA), the system exhibits hysteretic switching between two different resistive states which occur at critical values of the amplitude of the alternating current Vac. These observations were explained theoretically [6] within the framework of the so-called \"phase-locking\" model [7-9], which describes the dynamics of JJA's driven by both dc and ac currents. However, this description does not take into account effects associated with the presence of impurities or defects in the samples [10] .\nIn order to understand the influence of disorder on the dynamical properties of JJAs one needs to consider the microscopic details of the underlying physical processes taking place inside the material [11] . To this end we use here the quasiclassical approach [12] , which allows us to calculate the local density of states (LDOS) and the corresponding conductivities of disordered mesoscopic superconductors [13] . Within this formalism, the LDOS is determined self-consistently from the solution of the Usadel equation [14] \nwhere D(E) is the"}
{"text":"We present an analysis of the virialization process in protogalactic halos, using high-resolution N-body simulations with gas dynamics and radiative cooling. We find that the density profiles of dark matter halos are well described by the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile at all redshifts z < 10. The NFW concentration parameter c(z), which characterizes how concentrated is the halo mass distribution relative to its mean density, increases rapidly as redshift decreases below z = 5. This rapid increase can be explained by the fact that the central regions of the halos become denser due to adiabatic contraction caused by infalling baryons. However, we also find that this effect alone cannot explain the observed evolution of c(z). In order to reproduce the results obtained from our numerical experiments, it is necessary to assume that the initial conditions for the formation of these halos were set up such that they had already undergone some degree of previrialization before their collapse into galactic-sized objects."}
{"text":"We study the gravitational collapse of spherically-symmetric, electrically charged perfect fluids with pressure anisotropy and heat flow in general relativity. We find that for sufficiently large initial data there is no black hole formation but rather an asymptotically flat end state which can be interpreted as a naked singularity or a regular star-like object depending on whether the fluid has positive or negative radial pressure at spatial infinity respectively. The results are obtained by solving numerically the full set of coupled nonlinear partial differential equations governing the evolution of the system using a high-resolution shock-capturing scheme based on the method of lines combined with adaptive mesh refinement techniques. In addition to confirming previous numerical studies we also show how our approach allows us to obtain new insights into the dynamics of these systems such as the existence of multiple solutions corresponding to different final states.

{"text":"We present an analysis of high-resolution observations made with the Hinode Solar Optical Telescope (SOT) and compare them to results obtained by other authors using different instruments, including ground-based telescopes. We find that there are significant differences between our results for the intensity contrasts at various wavelengths and those reported previously. The most striking difference concerns the so-called \"G-band contrast\": we measure values which are significantly higher than previous estimates based on data taken with lower spatial resolution or poorer calibration techniques. This finding has important consequences for studies of solar magnetism as it implies that the magnetic field strength inferred from inversions of Stokes profiles may be underestimated if one uses incorrect assumptions about the temperature structure of the photosphere. In addition, we show how the observed variations in line width can be used to infer information about the velocity distribution function of photospheric plasma motions. Finally, we discuss possible reasons why some earlier measurements appear to have been affected by systematic errors."}
{"text":"We calculate the two-loop beta function for the coupling constant of the AdS5xS5 superstring theory and show that it is proportional to the one-loop result, which implies that there are no non-trivial fixed points at any finite value of the string coupling constant.  We also find that the dilaton field has an imaginary part when we take into account the higher-order terms beyond the leading order approximation. This indicates that our results may be valid only within some limited region of the parameter space where the imaginary part of the dilaton can be neglected. The present work was motivated by the recent study on the gauge\/gravity correspondence between N=4 super Yang-Mills (SYM) theories with 16 supercharges and type IIB strings on AdS5xS5G5 backgrounds [1] . In this context, the existence of nontrivial fixed points would correspond to the conformal invariance of the dual SYM theories [2] , while the imaginary part of the dilatonic scalar fields would indicate the instability of the corresponding solutions [3] .\nIn Ref. [4] , the authors have calculated the one-loop beta functions for both the metric tensor and the dilaton field using the Green-Schwarz formalism [5] . They found that these beta functions do not vanish even if they are evaluated at vanishing values of the string coupling constants. However, their calculations were performed under the assumption that all the fermionic contributions vanish identically [6] . It turns out that such an assumption does not hold true [7, 8] . Therefore, it seems necessary to perform more detailed analysis taking into account the effects due to the fermions as well as those coming from the bosons."}
{"text":"We present an analysis of the fundamental limits on position determination using concentration gradients in biological systems, such as bacteria and neurons. We show that these limits are determined by the number of molecules available for measurement at each location along the gradient. The optimal strategy is to measure all locations with equal precision; this leads to a limit on the accuracy of position determination given by $1\/\\sqrt{N}$ where $N$ is the total number of molecules measured across the entire system. This result holds even if we allow arbitrary prior information about the distribution of positions within the system. Our results provide insight into how cells can optimally use concentration gradients to determine their positions relative to other cells or external cues. In addition, our results suggest new ways to improve existing techniques used to track cell migration over time. \n \n Bacteria and neurons both sense chemical concentrations through receptors located throughout their surfaces. These receptors convert local chemical concentrations into electrical signals which are then transmitted back to the cell body via specialized signaling pathways. As a consequence, the amount of signal received depends not only upon the local concentration but also upon the distance between the receptor and the source of the signal (see Figure 1). For example, when a bacterium senses a nutrient molecule it will produce more signal if the nutrient is closer than if it were farther away. Similarly, when a neuron receives input from another neuron, its response will depend upon whether the synapse connecting them lies close to the center of the cell's dendritic tree or near one of its tips."}
{"text":"We study the relationship between network structure, dynamics, and function using an example system that is both complex and experimentally accessible -- the brain's neuronal circuitry. We show how to use statistical mechanics methods to analyze the functional properties of this system as it evolves over time through its underlying structural connectivity. In particular we focus on the role played by switches which are nodes with high degree centrality whose removal disconnects large portions of the network. Our results suggest that these switches play important roles in maintaining global dynamical stability while allowing for local flexibility. The manuscript is organized into four sections. Section I introduces our model and describes some basic features of the resulting networks. Section II presents numerical simulations showing how switching affects the evolution of the system. Section III analyzes the effect of removing switches on the networks' ability to maintain synchrony under perturbations. Finally section IV discusses possible extensions of our work.

{"text":"We consider the problem of two-user MIMO broadcast channel with multiple antennas at each transmitter, receiver pair. We propose an iterative algorithm to maximize the sum capacity by jointly optimizing transmit covariance matrices for both transmitters subject to power constraints. The proposed algorithm is based on alternating optimization between the users' precoding matrices. In addition, we show that the optimal solution can be obtained in closed form when one user has more receive than transmit antennas while the other user has less or equal number of receive as well as transmit antennas. Finally, numerical results are presented to demonstrate the performance gain achieved using our proposed scheme over existing schemes. Index Terms: Broadcast Channel (BC), Iterative Algorithm, Joint Transmission, Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO). 1 Introduction Wireless communication systems have been widely deployed recently due to their high data rate transmission capability [1] . However, wireless channels suffer from multipath fading which causes severe inter-symbol interference (ISI) [2] , resulting in poor system performance. To overcome this issue, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) [3] was introduced into wireless communications. OFDM divides the available bandwidth into several narrowband subcarriers so that ISI can be reduced significantly [4] .\nIn order to further improve spectral efficiency, multi-antenna techniques were incorporated into OFDM-based systems [5] - [8] . For example, Alamouti's space-time block coding [9] was applied to single-carrier systems [10] - [12] . Moreover, it was shown that spatial diversity could also be exploited through cooperative relaying [13] - [15] . Recently, there has been growing interest in exploiting cooperation among different nodes [16] - [18] . It was demonstrated that significant gains can be achieved if all cooperating nodes use joint transmission [19] - [21] ."}

{"text":"The rapid growth in the use and production of digital media has created an urgent need to develop new models that support long-term access, preservation, and reuse of personal archives.  In this article we present a service model for managing personal archives based on three key concepts:  The archive is viewed as a collection of interrelated objects (e.g., documents, photos); each object is associated with one or more services that provide functionality such as storage, editing, sharing, etc.; and these services are organized into a hierarchy reflecting their relationships.   We describe how our approach can be used by individuals to manage their own personal archives, and also discuss its potential application within organizations where large volumes of data must be managed over extended periods of time. The rapid growth in the use of digital media has led to increased interest in developing systems that allow users to preserve and share their personal information across multiple devices and platforms. However, current approaches have focused primarily on providing solutions for storing and accessing content rather than addressing issues related to preserving it over time. This problem becomes particularly acute when dealing with collections containing thousands of items spanning several years. To address this issue, we propose a service-oriented architecture for organizing and maintaining personal archives."}
{"text":"We report on observations made in March and April 2002 at 345 GHz using the Atacama Submillimiter Telescope Experiment (ASTE). We detected no significant emission associated with the host galaxy of the gamma-ray burst GRB 980425, which was discovered by BeppoSAX on Apr. 25, 1998 . The 3 sigma upper limit to the flux density is < 0.5 Jy beam-1 , corresponding to an integrated line intensity ICO< 1 x 10^9 K km s^-1 pc^2 or Mgas < 2 x 10^8 Msun .\nThe non-detection suggests that either the molecular gas mass is much lower than previously estimated or that it has been destroyed by the intense UV radiation field produced during the burst.

For both compositions we find that the Ho3+ ions are in an intermediate valence state with a charge close to +3.2. We also observe that the lattice parameters change continuously as a function of temperature indicating that these compounds do not undergo any structural phase transitions over this range of temperatures.

{"text":"We present the results for the Dbar-N scattering lengths in the framework of chiral perturbation theory (ChPT) with explicit Delta degrees of freedom, including one-loop corrections to the leading order terms as well as contributions from Delta-hole excitations at next-to-leading order.  We find that the inclusion of these effects leads to an increase of the central value of the isoscalar scattering length by about 30% compared to previous calculations based on ChPT without explicit Delta degrees of freedom. The uncertainty due to unknown low-energy constants is reduced significantly when using experimental information on pion-nucleon scattering amplitudes. In addition we calculate the corresponding spin observables and compare our predictions with available lattice QCD data. \nI. INTRODUCTORY REMARK\nThe study of hadronic interactions involving light quarks has been a subject of great interest over many years. This is mainly motivated by their relevance for nuclear physics but also because they provide important insights into non-perturbative aspects of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). For example, the nucleon-meson system provides valuable input for understanding the structure of nuclei or the properties of neutron stars [1] . On the other hand, the investigation of heavy-light systems such as charmonium can be used to test perturbative methods within QCD [2] .\nIn this work we will focus on the calculation of the scattering lengths between a neutral charm-anticharm meson and a nucleon. These quantities are particularly interesting since they determine the threshold behavior of the respective scattering amplitude which is directly related to the production cross section near threshold [3] . Furthermore, the knowledge of the scattering lengths allows us to extract information on the underlying potential describing the interaction between the two particles [4] . Finally, it should be noted that the determination of the scattering lengths requires only very little theoretical assumptions [5] , making them ideal candidates for testing different approaches [6] .\nII. THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK\n\nA. Meson Exchange Dynamics\nMeson exchange models have proven useful in describing various types of hadronic reactions [7, 8] .

{"text":"We study the quantum Hall effect (QHE) and its interplay with magnetism in monolayer graphene by using an effective low-energy model that takes into account both electron-electron interactions and disorder effects. We show how to derive this model starting from first principles, and we discuss some of its main properties. In particular, we find that at half-filling it exhibits two different phases depending on the strength of the Coulomb interaction between electrons. For weak coupling these are separated by a phase transition driven by spontaneous breaking of time-reversal symmetry; for strong coupling they correspond respectively to a conventional QHE state and to a novel fractionalized topological insulator characterized by chiral edge states. The latter is shown to be equivalent to a spin-1\/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the honeycomb lattice, which can thus be described within the framework of the so-called SU(4) bosonic representation."}
{"text":"The traveling salesman problem (TSP) is one of the most famous problems in combinatorial optimization, which asks for finding an optimal tour through all vertices of a given graph such that each edge is visited exactly once. In this work we study TSP on graphs with special structure called Hamiltonian graphs. We show how to solve TSP optimally on these graphs by using dynamic programming. Moreover, we present some new results about Hamiltonicity testing algorithms based on our approach. The traveling salesman problem (also known as the travelling salesperson or salesman's route problem) is one of the best-known problems in combinatorial optimization. It can be formulated as follows: Given a complete weighted undirected graph G = (V , E), find a cycle C passing through every vertex v \u2208 V at least once so that the total weight w(C ) of edges in C is minimized. This problem has been studied extensively since its formulation more than 50 years ago."}
{"text":"We report on the first detection of proper motion in two thin dust filaments located near Sgr A*, the supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the center of our Galaxy. The filaments are detected as dark features against bright infrared background emission and have been observed with the Submillimeter Array for more than four years. We find that both filaments show significant proper motions toward us, which we interpret to be due to their orbital motion around Sgr A*. Using simple models, we estimate the masses of these filaments to be between 10^6 M_sol and 10^7 M_sol . These results provide new insights into the formation process of such structures close to galactic nuclei. Dust filaments are ubiquitous in galaxies across cosmic time. They can form by gravitational instabilities or through outflows driven by active galactic nuclei (AGN). However, it is still unclear how they evolve over time and what physical processes drive them. In this Letter, we present the first measurement of proper motions of two thin dust filaments at projected distances of less than 100 pc from Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), the central supermassive black hole of the Milky Way. Our observations were carried out using the Submillimeter Array (SMA; Ho et al., 2004) , an interferometer operating at wavelengths ranging from 0.8 mm to 3.5 mm. Both filaments appear as dark features against the bright infrared background emission produced by warm dust surrounding Sgr A*. Their apparent velocities range from 50 km\/s to 150 km\/s , consistent with previous measurements based on single-dish data (Molinari et al., 2011) . By modeling the orbits of the filaments under Newtonian gravity, we derive mass estimates of about 106-107 solar masses (Msolar) for each filament. This result suggests that the filaments may represent gravitationally bound objects orbiting Sgr A*."}

{"text":"We report the discovery and analysis of IGR J16194-2810, an unusual X-ray source discovered by INTEGRAL in 2003.

{"text":"We study the stability properties of longitudinal flows in straight and curved magnetic flux tubes using linearized ideal MHD equations. We find that for sufficiently large values of plasma beta, there is always an unstable mode with zero frequency (i.e., static) which grows exponentially fast at small wavenumbers. The growth rate increases monotonically as we increase the value of plasma beta. \n \n For smaller values of plasma beta, however, this instability disappears completely. In fact, we show analytically that if the plasma beta is less than some critical value then all modes are stable irrespective of their frequencies or wavelengths. This result agrees well with our numerical simulations. Finally, we also present results on the effect of curvature on the stability properties of longitudinal flow. It turns out that the presence of curvature has no significant effect on the stability properties of these flows. However, it does affect the nature of the eigenfunctions associated with different eigenvalues."}
{"text":"We present the results of an investigation into the evolution of dark matter halos and their substructure, using high-resolution cosmological N-body simulations with different mass resolutions. We find that the number density profiles of subhalos are well described by a power law at all redshifts z < 5 for both low-mass (10^9 Msun\/h) and high-mass (10^12 Msun\/h) halos. The slope of this profile is independent of halo mass but depends on redshift; it steepens as time progresses. This behavior can be understood if we assume that the subhalo population consists of two components: one which follows the host's potential closely and another whose orbits have been significantly affected by dynamical friction. In addition, we show that the fraction of subhalos within r200c decreases rapidly towards higher masses. Finally, we demonstrate how our findings can be used to quantify the effect of numerical resolution on the abundance of subhalos."}
{"text":"The statistical mechanics of networks is an emerging field that has attracted much attention in recent years, especially after the discovery of scale-free and small-world properties in many real world systems such as social networks, biological networks, technological networks etc.. In this talk I will present some results on the statistical mechanics of random graphs with arbitrary degree distributions. The main focus will be on the phase transitions associated with the appearance\/disappearance of giant connected components (GCC) in these graphs. We show how to calculate exactly the probability distribution function for GCC size using generating functions techniques. This allows us to study analytically the effect of various parameters like average connectivity, clustering coefficient, node degrees etc., on the formation of GCCs. Finally we discuss possible applications of our results to problems related to epidemic spreading on networks. The statistical mechanics of networks is one of the most active areas of research today.

Finally, some possible applications of this approach are discussed.

These investigations have mainly focused on phonological systems (e.g., Ferrer-i-Cancho 2002 , Ferrer-i-Cancho & Sol\u00e9 2007 or lexical-semantic relations (e.g., Steyvers & Tenenbaum 2005 ) . However, there has also been interest in exploring other linguistic levels such as morphosyntax (Ferrer-i-Canchos 2006 ) , prosody (Ferrer-i-Canch\u00f3s 2008) , pragmatics (Ferrer-i-Canchis 2009) or even discourse (Ferrer-i-Canchi 2010) . This article focuses on one particular aspect of syntax -namely, word order-using network analysis to explore its structural characteristics. More specifically, we will use network theory to analyze data collected with corpus-linguistic methods. We believe that this type of investigation could provide new insights into the way in which syntactic structures emerge during language acquisition."}
{"text":"The present work is concerned with efficient methods to calculate molecular properties, such as vibrational frequencies or electronic excitation energies, using ab initio quantum chemical techniques. The main focus lies on the calculation of these quantities for large systems containing many atoms (e.g., proteins). In this context we have developed an approach which allows us to reduce computational costs significantly by combining two different approximations. First, we use split-valence Gaussian basis functions instead of conventional Cartesian Gaussians. Second, we apply the so-called \"heterolevel\" approximation within restricted Hartree-Fock theory and second-order Moller-Plesset perturbation theory. This combination leads to very accurate results at low computational cost even if applied to relatively large molecules like polypeptides. We demonstrate that our method can be used successfully to study the influence of solvent effects on the structure and stability of small peptides. Finally, we show how it may also be employed to investigate excited-state processes occurring during photochemical reactions."}
{"text":"We present new results on the distribution of the electron index, p, in GRB afterglow models using data from Swift\/BATSE bursts with known redshifts (z < 5). We find that the distribution is consistent with being log-normal for both low-z and high-z samples. The mean value of p decreases slightly with increasing redshift but there are no significant differences between the two distributions at fixed z. This suggests that the physical processes which determine the value of p do not evolve significantly over cosmic time scales. Using our best-fit values we show how the observed X-ray light curves can be used to constrain the structure of the circumburst medium. In particular, we demonstrate that it should be possible to distinguish between different density profiles by comparing the temporal decay slopes of the early-time X-ray emission with those measured later during the prompt phase. \n \n Keywords: Gamma-ray bursts, Electron index"}
{"text":"We introduce the concept of separability functions, which are generalizations of Dyson indices to arbitrary finite groups. We show that these functions can be used as indicators for quantum entanglement in mixed states. In particular we prove that separability probabilities vanish if and only if all separable pure state decompositions have vanishing Schmidt coefficients. This is an extension of the result by Peres-Horodecki on positive partial transpose matrices. Finally we present some explicit examples illustrating our results. The concept of separability functions was introduced recently [1] . These functions provide a generalization of Dyson indices [2] , which were originally defined for Lie algebras, to arbitrary finite groups. They play an important role in physics since they appear naturally when studying the properties of many-body systems with short-range interactions [3] .\nIn this work we study how separability functions behave under tensor products. It turns out that their behavior depends crucially on whether or not the group has Abelian subgroups. For example it follows directly from the definition that separability functions do not change at all under tensor product over Abelian groups. On the other hand there exist non-Abelian groups where separability functions increase exponentially under tensor product [4] . As another consequence of our analysis we obtain new bounds on the number of linearly independent separability functions [5] ."}
{"text":"We present an integrate-and-fire model that reproduces the basic features of late long-term potentiation (LTP) and memory maintenance in hippocampal networks. The model is based on the assumption that LTP can be induced by coincident pre-synaptic spikes, which are generated during learning episodes. We show how this mechanism leads to persistent changes in synaptic weights between neurons with correlated firing patterns. These weight changes lead to increased network activity after learning events, thereby maintaining memories over time scales longer than those associated with individual neuronal dynamics. Our results suggest that LTP may play a role not only in short-term plasticity but also in long-term storage mechanisms for information processing in neural circuits. Learning and memory processes have been studied extensively using computational models of artificial neural networks [1-3] as well as theoretical approaches [4] . In particular, it has been shown that Hebbian forms of synaptic plasticity such as long-term potentiation (or depression), when combined with appropriate learning rules [5-7] , can account for many aspects of these phenomena [8] .\nIn recent years there has been growing interest in understanding the relationship between cellular-level biophysical properties of neurons and their functional roles within larger-scale brain structures [9] . Computational modeling studies at different levels of abstraction [10] provide useful insights into possible relationships among various physiological parameters [11] . However, most existing models do not take into account the fact that neurons communicate via spike trains rather than continuous signals [12] . This raises questions about whether or not current theories of learning and memory are compatible with known neurophysiological data [13] ."}
{"text":"We present results for the pion mass dependence of several observables in nuclear matter, obtained with chiral effective field theory at next-to-leading order (NLO). We consider the nucleon scalar density and spin polarization functions as well as the isovector vector current-current correlation function. The latter quantity can be related to the longitudinal part of the electric polarizability of the neutron. In addition we study the energy per particle in symmetric nuclear matter and the symmetry energy coefficient C_s4. Our calculations are performed within an extended framework that allows us to include finite-range effects beyond standard local potentials. This is achieved by including explicit delta degrees of freedom into our formalism. For all quantities considered here we find very good agreement between theoretical predictions based on this approach and available experimental data over a wide range of values of the pion mass. Furthermore, we compare our results to those obtained using other approaches such as relativistic mean-field models or lattice QCD simulations."}
{"text":"We study the Catalan numbers in connection with the number of ways to realize a given triangulation as an ordered sequence of its diagonals, or equivalently, as a set of non-crossing diagonals. We show that this problem is related to counting certain types of Dyck paths. In particular we prove that for any positive integer n there are exactly C(n) different sequences of diagonals which can be realized by a convex quadrilateral having 2n sides. This result generalizes a theorem due to Motzkin and Straus on the number of diagonalizations of a convex polygon. \nIntroduction\n\nThe Catalan numbers count many combinatorial objects such as binary trees, noncrossing partitions, spanning trees, etc., see e.g.  [1, 2] . The present work deals with another class of Catalan-like objects: triangulations of polygons (see Figure 1 ). A triangulation T of a simple polygon P is defined as follows: it consists of all edges of P together with some additional diagonals connecting pairs of vertices of P so that each interior angle of P becomes at least 90 degrees after adding these diagonals. It follows immediately that every edge belongs to one and only one diagonal of T .\nIn [3] , Motzkin and Straus' celebrated theorem states that if D denotes the set of diagonals of a convex polygon Q then |D| = 2|Q|. They also proved that the number of diagonalizations d(P ) of a convex polygon P equals the number of diagonals of a triangulation of P . \nIt was shown recently [4] that the number of diagonals in a triangulation of a convex quadrilateral is equal to four times the number of diagonals needed to diagonalize the quadrilateral. Thus, the following question arises naturally: What is the relationship between the number of diagonals required to diagonalize a convex quadrilateral and the number of diagonals used in a triangulation?"}
{"text":"We report on the absorption spectrum of an isolated single-wall carbon nanotube (SWNT) in solution, obtained by using a scanning near-field optical microscope with subwavelength resolution. The SWNTs are suspended between two gold electrodes and illuminated through one electrode at normal incidence to excite both transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) polarized light. We observe that the TE mode is strongly suppressed compared to TM polarization due to the presence of metallic tubes within our sample. This effect can be used as a spectroscopic tool for identifying the chirality of individual SWNTs. \n \n Single-wall carbon nanotubes have attracted considerable interest because they exhibit unique electronic properties which depend sensitively on their diameter and chiral angle [1] . In particular, it has been shown theoretically [2] , experimentally [3] , and numerically [4] that the energy gap depends on these parameters such that semiconducting tubes have small gaps while metallic tubes have large ones. However, this dependence is not sufficient to uniquely identify all possible tube types [5] .\n \nIn order to determine the type of each tube individually, several experimental techniques have been developed [6] - [8] . For example, Raman scattering [9] or photoluminescence [10] measurements allow one to distinguish between metallic and semiconducting tubes based on the intensity ratio of certain peaks [11] . Alternatively, electrical transport experiments [12] provide information about the charge carrier density and mobility [13] . Finally, transmission electron microscopy [14] allows one to directly visualize the structure of the tubes [15] . \n \n Here we present another method for determining the chirality of individual carbon nanotubes. Our approach relies on measuring the absorption cross section of individual SWNTs [16] . Since the absorption cross-section depends on the dielectric function [17] , which in turn varies significantly depending on whether the tube is metallic or semiconducting [18] , we expect different values for the absorption cross sections of metallic versus semiconducting tubes. By comparing the measured absorption cross sections of various tubes, we will show how this technique can be used to classify them into either metallic or semiconducting categories. \nExperimental setup\n\nThe samples were prepared following the"}

INTRODUCTORY REMAR K\nThe Standard Model (SM) of particle physics describes all known fundamental interactions except gravity. It contains one generation of left-handed neutrinos whose masses are generated by the Higgs mechanism [1] , but it does not explain why these particles have such small masses compared to other SM fermions [2] .\nIn order to address this question, many extensions of the SM have been proposed over the years [3] . In particular, theories based on gauge groups larger than SU(3) C \u00d7SU(2) L \u00d7U(1) Y predict new states beyond those present in the SM [4] . These new states may include right-handed neutrinos [5] or scalar fields [6] . If they exist at low energies, they could lead to observable effects [7, 8] .\nOne possible way to test whether new degrees of freedom exist below the electroweak scale is through precision measurements [9] . Another possibility is to look for signals of new physics in rare processes [10] . Finally, if new particles are produced directly at high energy colliders [11] , then their properties can also be studied [12] ."}
{"text":"We present evidence for alignment between the quadrupole, octopole and hexadecapole moments of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature anisotropy on large angular scales as measured by the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP). We find that this alignment is statistically significant at greater than 5 sigma confidence level when compared to simulated random realizations of CMB maps with identical power spectrum but different phases. \n \n The observed alignment can be explained if there are large-scale magnetic fields aligned along the line-of-sight which induce circular polarization in the primordial plasma prior to recombination. This effect would lead to an additional contribution to the Stokes Q parameter of the CMB radiation. In addition we show that the observed anomalous behaviour of the quadrupole moment may also be caused by such effects. Finally, we discuss possible implications of our results for inflationary models. We argue that these observations do not rule out slow-roll single-field inflation scenarios, however they provide new constraints on their parameters."}
{"text":"We present the first results on clustering measurements for luminous red galaxies (LRGs) in the redshift range 0.5 <z<0.8, obtained with the Anglo-Australian Observatory's multi-object spectrograph AAOmega. We use data from the 2dF-SDSS LRG and QSO survey to measure the projected correlation function wp(rp). The observed clustering amplitude is consistent with that expected from linear theory predictions based on current cosmological models. This result provides an important test of these models over this redshift range where there are few other constraints available. In addition we find evidence for evolution in the galaxy bias parameter between our two samples separated by ~0.2 Gyrs. These results will be presented in detail elsewhere. \n \n Keywords: Luminous Red Galaxies; Clustering; Bias Evolution; Cosmology. 1 Introduction \n \n A number of recent studies have shown that luminous red galaxies (hereafter LRGs), selected via their optical colours or near-infrared photometry, provide powerful probes of large-scale structure out to high redshifts (e.g., Eisenstein et al. 2001; Wake et al. 2006; Padmanabhan et al. 2007; Blake et al. 2008; Ross et al. 2008) . Their large luminosities mean they can be detected efficiently even at relatively low redshifts, while their red colours make them easy to identify spectroscopically. They also tend to reside in massive dark matter haloes which evolve slowly through cosmic time, making them useful tracers of the underlying mass distribution. As such, they offer unique opportunities to study both the growth of structures as well as the nature of dark energy driving its accelerated expansion (see e.g., Percival & White 2009 , for a review). \n \n Here we report the first measurement of the spatial clustering properties of LRGs in the redshift range 0<z<0.8 made possible by combining data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) (York et al. 2000) , the Two Degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS) (Colless et al."}
{"text":"We report results of X-ray observations with Suzaku satellite of the nucleus of radio-loud active galaxy Centaurus A (NGC 5128). The data were obtained in 2006 and 2007, when the source was observed for about 100 ks each time. We find that the spectrum is well described by an absorbed power-law model modified at low energies by photoelectric absorption due to cold gas. No significant emission lines are detected above 3 keV. Using this spectral model we derive constraints on abundances of heavy elements in the accretion flow onto supermassive black hole located in the center of NGC 5128. In particular, we show that iron abundance relative to solar value cannot be higher than 1.5-2 times its solar value.

{"text":"In this thesis we study distributed algorithms for spectrum allocation, power control, routing, and congestion control problems in wireless networks. We first consider the problem of joint channel assignment and power control (JCAPC) with minimum total transmit power consumption subject to quality-of-service constraints on each link. The JCAPC problem is formulated as an integer program which can be solved by using standard linear programming techniques. However, such centralized solutions are not practical due to their high computational complexity. In order to overcome these difficulties, we propose two distributed algorithms based on dual decomposition methods. Our simulation results show that our proposed algorithms perform close to optimality while requiring only local information exchange among neighboring nodes. \n \n Next, we investigate the problem of joint routing and congestion control (JRCC). This problem arises when there exists multiple paths between source-destination pairs in a network. Each path has different available bandwidths depending on its physical characteristics. To achieve fairness across all flows sharing common links, JRCC requires that the rate allocated to any flow should depend on both the current load along the path it uses and the number of competing flows. We formulate the JRCC problem as a convex optimization problem whose objective function is to maximize the aggregate utility over all users under certain capacity constraints at each node. Then, we develop a distributed algorithm based on primal decomposition method to solve the JRCC problem. Finally, we present some numerical examples to demonstrate the performance of our proposed algorithm."}
{"text":"We study the clustering coefficients of protein-protein interaction networks (PPINs) and their relationship with network topological properties, such as degree distribution and average path length. We find that PPINs have higher clustering coefficients than random graphs with similar degrees or scale-free networks generated by Barabasi-Albert model. The high clustering coefficient is mainly due to the existence of many triangles in these networks. In addition, we show that the clustering coefficients are correlated positively with the number of proteins but negatively with the number of interactions per protein. These results suggest that there may be some common mechanisms underlying the formation of both triangles and edges between two nodes with large degrees. Finally, we propose an algorithm for identifying functional modules based on local clustering analysis. Our method can identify clusters with different sizes and shapes. Clustering coefficients of protein-protein interactomes are studied. It is found that they are significantly larger than those of random graphs with same degree distributions or scale-free networks generated using Barabasi-Albert preferential attachment rule.

We show that our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art methods by finding higher quality solutions faster than competing algorithms. Our results are obtained on both synthetic benchmark graphs as well as real-world social networks. Identifying the community structure in complex networks has been one of the most active areas of research over recent years [1] . In this context, many different approaches have been proposed ranging from purely statistical techniques [2] , spectral clustering [3] or hierarchical clustering [4] to more sophisticated heuristics such as evolutionary algorithms [5] .\nIn particular, Newman introduced the concept of modularity [6] , which measures how much better a given partitioning into communities fits the data compared to a random graph model. This measure has become very popular since it allows to compare partitions of different sizes and shapes [7, 8] . However, maximizing modularity is known to be NP-hard [9] and therefore requires efficient heuristic search strategies [10] .

In particular we find that the self-diffusion coefficient D(t), which describes how fast particles diffuse through space at time t, depends strongly on the lattice structure. For example, if the system consists of two identical sub-lattices connected via hopping processes only along the bonds connecting them, then D(t) exhibits a non-monotonic behavior as function of time: it first increases until reaching its maximum value after some characteristic relaxation time, followed by a decrease towards zero. This behavior can be explained by analyzing the probability distribution P(r,t) of finding a particle at position r at time t."}

{"text":"The human genome is composed of coding sequences (CDSs) that encode proteins, non-coding sequences (NCSs), which are transcribed but not translated into protein products, and introns, which are removed during splicing to produce mature mRNAs.

However, it remains unclear whether these regulatory functions can also be achieved by other types of NCSs including enhancers, promoters, insulators, silencers, etc., especially those located outside of genes. Here we show that all known classes of NCSs contain information for expressing adaptive phenotypes using an unbiased computational approach based on machine learning algorithms. We found that each class of NCSs has distinct features associated with their specific function(s). In addition, we discovered a novel principle underlying the evolution of NCSs: the evolutionary process tends to increase the complexity of NCSs until they reach a maximum point beyond which further increases would lead to decreased fitness.

In particular we prove that the ground state degeneracy of the Kitaev model on any closed 3-manifold M equals the number of independent solutions of certain differential equations called Witten's equation. This result can be viewed as a generalization of the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer index theorem to manifolds with boundary. Finally, using the results obtained above, we derive some exact formulas for the partition function of the Kitaev model defined on surfaces with boundaries. These formulas generalize the celebrated formula due to Witten for the partition function of Yang-Mills fields on Riemann surfaces."}
{"text":"We present the first results on magnetic turbulence generated by relativistic collisionless shocks using PIC simulations with electron-positron plasmas. We find that, for high shock Lorentz factors ($\\gamma_{s}$), the downstream turbulent spectrum is dominated by large-scale modes and has an anisotropic power-law shape extending to scales much larger than those observed in previous studies with only electrons or ions. The spectral index depends weakly on $\\gamma_{s}$ but increases significantly as we increase the upstream magnetization parameter $\\sigma_{u}$. For low $\\gamma_{s}$, however, the turbulent spectrum becomes more broadband and less anisotropic. In this regime, the energy density contained in the largest scale mode decreases rapidly compared to higher $\\gamma_{s}$ cases.  These findings are consistent with recent observations made at Earth's bow shock where the solar wind plasma is compressed into a thin layer. Our results suggest that the generation mechanism of magnetic turbulence may be different between these two regimes."}

{"text":"We present the first results on supersonic isothermal turbulence obtained with our new numerical code, which solves the equations for compressible gas dynamics in three dimensions using an adaptive mesh refinement technique.  We have performed simulations at Mach numbers M = 3 and 5, and resolutions ranging between 64^3 and 256^3 grid points. The initial conditions are random density fluctuations that obey Gaussian statistics. In all cases we find that the kinetic energy decays rapidly to zero as a result of shocks forming throughout the computational volume. However, the decay rate depends strongly upon resolution; it decreases by about 50% when going from 64^3 to 128^3 cells per dimension. This suggests that the dissipation scale is comparable to or smaller than the size of individual cells. At late times (t > 10 time units) the velocity field becomes dominated by large-scale coherent structures whose power spectrum follows a Kolmogorov scaling law over more than two decades in wavenumber space."}
{"text":"We report on the fluidization of a thin, horizontally vibrating granular bed by vertical oscillations at low frequency and amplitude. The system is studied experimentally using high-speed video imaging in combination with particle tracking velocimetry (PTV). We find that for sufficiently large vibration amplitudes, particles are ejected from the surface into the air as they reach their maximum height during an upward motion. This leads to the formation of a dilute gas phase above the dense packing near the bottom of the container. In addition we observe convection rolls which transport grains across the entire depth of the bed. These results show striking similarities to those observed in vibrated beds of sand or glass beads but differ significantly from previous studies performed on systems where only horizontal vibrations were applied. Vibrations can induce transitions between different states of matter such as solids, liquids, and gases [1] . For example, it has been shown that a solid state may become unstable when subjected to periodic forcing [2] , resulting in the spontaneous generation of traveling waves [3] . A particularly interesting case occurs if both horizontal and vertical components of the driving force act simultaneously [4] .\nIn this work we study the response of a thin granular layer to simultaneous application of horizontal and vertical vibrations. Our experiments reveal new phenomena not seen before in other types of driven granular media."}
{"text":"Glutamatergic synapses are the most abundant excitatory connections in the brain, but how they form is not well understood. Here we show that glutamate receptors (GluRs) can be delivered directly to synaptic sites by lateral diffusion on the plasma membrane or indirectly via endocytosis followed by recycling endosomes. We used single-particle tracking with total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy to follow GluR2-containing AMPA receptors tagged with quantum dots at hippocampal neuron dendrites. The results reveal two distinct trafficking routes for receptor delivery to synapses. First, receptors diffuse laterally along the surface until encountering an existing synapse where they become trapped. Second, receptors enter endosomal vesicles after endocytosis and then recycle back to the cell surface through Rab11-positive recycling endosomes before being targeted to new synapses. These findings provide insights into mechanisms underlying formation of functional neuronal circuits during development as well as plasticity of mature neurons."}
{"text":"The Ras proteins are small GTPases that play an important role in many cellular processes, including proliferation and differentiation.  The active form of Ras is anchored to the plasma membrane by its C-terminal farnesylated cysteine residue (Cys-186). Here we use single molecule fluorescence microscopy to study the distribution of this anchor on the surface of living cells. We find that the anchor forms clusters with sizes ranging between 50 nm and 1 \u00b5m. These clusters have a higher density than expected for a random distribution of molecules. In addition, they show a strong correlation with the actin cytoskeleton. Our results suggest that these clusters may be involved in regulating the activity of Ras at the plasma membrane. Ras proteins are small G-proteins which play an essential role in many signaling pathways inside eukaryotic cells [1] . They cycle between inactive GDP-bound states and active GTP-bound states [2] , where their conformation changes upon binding or hydrolyzing guanosine triphosphate [3] .\nRas proteins can exist as monomers [4] but also dimerize [5] and oligomerize [6] . Their activation depends strongly on their localization [7, 8] : when activated, Ras binds to the inner side of the plasma membrane [9] via its C terminus [10] . This interaction is mediated by the lipid moiety attached to the protein [11] . It has been shown that the prenyl group plays a crucial role in mediating the association of Ras with membranes [12] . However, it was recently suggested that additional interactions involving amino acids close to the prenylated cysteine contribute significantly to the affinity [13] ."}

{"text":"We study the multicritical behavior in the two-dimensional gonihedric model with nearest-neighbor interactions on an anisotropic triangular lattice. We show that this system realizes the (d,m ) = ( 3 , 2 ) Lifshitz point and exhibits three different phases at zero temperature as functions of two parameters characterizing the anisotropy of the lattice structure. The phase diagram is obtained by means of Monte Carlo simulations combined with finite-size scaling analysis. In addition to the conventional ordered state and disordered state, we find another novel phase which has neither translational nor orientational order but shows algebraic decaying spin-spin correlations. This new phase can be regarded as a kind of spin-liquid-like state.

{"text":"We study the effect of local optical phonons on the electronic transport properties of a quantum dot system by using the nonequilibrium Green's function method combined with the density functional theory (DFT). We find that the electron-phonon interaction can induce a strong enhancement to the Kondo resonance peak and lead to a significant reduction of the Kondo temperature TK, which is determined as the energy scale at which the conductance reaches its maximum value Gmax. The results show that the Kondo temperature decreases rapidly when increasing the strength of the electron-phonon coupling constant \u03bb. In addition, we also investigate how the Kondo temperature depends on the size of the quantum dots for different values of \u03bb. Our findings may be useful for understanding the physical mechanism behind some recent experiments. Introduction:-The Kondo effect has been studied extensively both theoretically [1]-[3]and experimentally [4] - [6] . It occurs due to the formation of a many-body singlet state between localized magnetic moments and conduction electrons near the Fermi level [7, 8] , leading to a sharp zero-bias anomaly in the differential conductance [9] . Recently, it was found that this phenomenon could occur even without any magnetic impurities [10] - [12] .\nIn fact, the Kondo effect has attracted much attention recently because of its potential applications in spintronics devices [13] - [16] . For example, the Kondo effect can be used to design novel spin transistors [17] or single-spin qubits [18] . However, there are still several open questions about the Kondo effect such as: How does the Kondo temperature depend on the size of the nanostructures? What happens if one introduces other degrees of freedom into the system?\nTo answer these questions, various theoretical methods have been developed [19] - [22] . Among them, the nonequilibrium Green functions technique [23] - [25] provides us with powerful tools to calculate the current through the systems under consideration [26] - [28] . This approach allows us not only to obtain the steady-state current but also to explore the time evolution of the current after switching on\/off external fields [29] - [31] .

In particular, we show how to compute Nash equilibria of such games using convex optimization techniques. Our numerical results demonstrate significant gains in terms of both network throughput and energy efficiency compared to conventional schemes based on fixed-rate transmissions.

{"text":"We consider the problem of energy-efficient resource allocation for wireless networks under qualityof-service (QoS) constraints, where each user has an individual QoS requirement and is equipped with multiple radios to communicate simultaneously over different channels. We propose a novel framework that jointly optimizes power control, channel assignment, scheduling, and routing by formulating it as a mixed integer linear program (MILP). The proposed MILP formulation takes into account both intra-cell interference among users within one cell and inter-cell interference between neighboring cells. To solve this large-scale optimization problem efficiently, we develop two efficient algorithms based on Lagrangian relaxation techniques. Our simulation results show that our proposed algorithm can significantly improve network performance compared to existing schemes. In particular, when there are only a few active links per cell at any time instant, our scheme achieves up to 4 times higher throughput than the baseline scheme without increasing transmit powers or bandwidths. \n \n Keywords: Energy efficiency, Power control, Channel assignment, Scheduling"}

The proposed approach is based on the concept that all users should be allocated their required data rates at minimum total transmit power consumption while maintaining acceptable quality-of-service (QoS). We first develop a new analytical model which can accurately predict the average received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) under different system configurations. Based on our analysis results, we then formulate the problem as a convex optimization problem subject to SINR constraints. Finally, by applying Lagrange multiplier method, we obtain closed-form solutions for both uplink and downlink transmissions. Our simulation results show that compared with conventional schemes such as water-filling algorithm, the proposed approach achieves significant performance gains in terms of power efficiency without sacrificing QoS requirements. In addition, it also outperforms other existing approaches in terms of computational complexity. \n \n Keywords: Code Division Multiple Access, Power Control"}

{"text":"We have studied the infrared (IR) properties of water and methanol maser sources in nearby galaxies using data obtained by the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO). We find that most of these masers are located near luminous IR objects, such as ultraluminous infrared galaxies or active galactic nuclei. The majority of the masers appear to be excited by shocks produced by outflows driven by massive stars. However, we also found some masers which may be excited by accretion onto young stellar objects. These results suggest that both massive star formation and low-mass star formation can produce masing gas clouds. Masers are powerful tools for studying physical conditions in interstellar media because they provide information on molecular abundances and kinematics at high spatial resolution. Water and methanol masers are commonly observed toward star-forming regions in our Galaxy and other nearby galaxies. They are thought to trace dense molecular gas where protostars form. Since their discovery more than 30 years ago, many studies have been carried out to investigate the relationship between masers and various phenomena related to star formation processes. \n \n In this study, we investigated the infrared (IR) environment around masers detected in nearby galaxies using ISO observations. Our sample consists of all known extragalactic water and methanol masers listed in the catalogs compiled by Caswell & Haynes(1987), Hoffman et al.(1989), and Pestalozzi et al. (2005) . Most of them were discovered serendipitously during surveys conducted with single-dish radio telescopes. Although there is no complete census of masers in external galaxies yet, it has been estimated that about 10 percent of local ULIRGs show maser emission (e.g., Gao 1996; Braatz et al. 1997 ). This suggests that masers play an important role in understanding the nature of ULIRGs."}
{"text":"In this work, we propose an evolutionary algorithm to evolve ensemble classifiers in the context of multi-class classification problems. The proposed approach is based on the combination of two well-known techniques: genetic algorithms and bagging. We have conducted experiments using several datasets taken from UCI Machine Learning Repository. Our results show that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods such as Bagging or Random Forests. In addition, it has been shown that the use of ensembles can improve the performance of single models evolved by Genetic Programming (GP). This fact suggests that GP could be used not only to evolve individual solutions but also to evolve whole ensembles of solutions. Keywords: Ensemble learning, Multi-Class Classification, Genetic Algorithm, Bagging. 1 Introduction Ensembles are collections of multiple base learners whose outputs are combined into one final prediction [1] . They are widely used because they often provide better accuracy than any of their constituent members [2] .\nThe most popular approaches to combine predictions include voting schemes [3] , stacking [4] , boosting [5] , and blending [6] . However, these approaches require some knowledge about how to combine the output of each member of the ensemble [7? ] . For example, if there are three classes, then the simplest way would be to assign equal weights to all the classifiers; however, this may lead to poor performance when dealing with imbalanced data [8] . Other more sophisticated ways involve assigning different weights according to the confidence level of each classifier [9] ; however, finding optimal values for those parameters requires additional effort [10] .\nRecently, researchers have started exploring new ways to automatically generate ensembles without requiring prior information [11] . One of them involves combining genetic algorithms [12] and bagging [13] . These two techniques were first applied separately [14, 15] , but later they were integrated together [16] ."}
{"text":"We study the effect of cascades initiated by ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) in intergalactic space, and their contribution to the diffuse gamma-ray emission observed at Earth. We find that cascade photons can be produced over cosmological distances with energies up to 10 TeV or more. The resulting flux is strongly suppressed for sources located beyond redshifts z > 0.5 due to absorption effects caused by pair production interactions between cascade photons and infrared radiation fields associated with galaxies. For nearby source models we show that this suppression leads to an upper limit on the photon fraction f\u03b3 < 10% \u2212 20% depending on the UHECR injection spectrum assumed. This constraint is consistent with current measurements of the diffuse gamma-ray background as well as recent results obtained using Fermi\/LAT data.

{"text":"We study the reflection of Alfven waves at the surface of a rotating star with an inclined magnetic field, which is relevant to the problem of coronal heating by MHD turbulence generated near the stellar surface. We show that if the angle between the wave vector k and the normal n to the reflecting surface satisfies cos(k\u00b7n) > 1 (over-reflection), then there exists a critical frequency \u03c9cr = \u221a 2\u2126 above which no Alfven waves can propagate into the interior region of the star. This leads to the formation of standing waves on the surface of the star whose amplitude grows exponentially as time goes on. The growth rate depends only weakly on the inclination angle \u03b8B of the magnetic field lines but strongly on the density contrast across the surface layer. For typical parameters of the Sun we find that the exponential growth starts after about one day for \u03b8B = 60 degrees and after about ten days for \u03b8B = 90 degrees."}

We use the rotation curve derived by Clemens (1985) , which is based on 21-cm line observations of nearby spiral galaxies. The total mass enclosed within a radius R can be written as: M(R) = Vrot2\u03c0GRL + MDW(R), where Vrot is the circular velocity at galactocentric distance R, G is Newton's constant, L is the luminosity density, and MDW(R) is the contribution due to the dark matter halo. In this work we assume that the dark matter follows a Navarro-Frenk-White profile.  Using the rotation curve for the solar neighbourhood given by Clemens (1985) (V\u2299 = 220 km\/sec), we find that the best-fit parameters are L0 = 0.0013 Msun\/pc3 and r0 = 1 kpc.

This reduction allows us to obtain lower bounds on the computational complexity of HFL satisfiability using known results about solving systems of polynomial equations. In particular, we prove PSPACE-hardness of HFL satisfiability when the number of fixpoint operators occurring in the formula is unbounded or restricted only to existential ones. On the other hand, we provide a simple algorithm for HFL satisfiability based on computing least solutions of certain systems of integer quadratic equations.

{"text":"We present the results of our study on bimodality in galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGN). We find that there is no significant difference between the fraction of AGNs hosted by red or blue galaxies, but we do see an excess of AGNs with respect to normal galaxies at intermediate colors. This suggests that AGNs are not preferentially found in either red or blue galaxies, as previously thought; instead they appear to be more common among galaxies with intermediate color. The lack of correlation between galaxy color and AGN activity may indicate that AGNs play only a minor role in quenching star formation in massive galaxies. Alternatively, it could suggest that AGNs have different effects depending on their luminosity and\/or accretion rate. In addition, we find that the majority of AGNs reside in galaxies with bulges, regardless of whether these galaxies are classified as early-type or late-type systems."}
{"text":"We present an explicit criterion to determine whether or not two given multipartite quantum states are separable, i.e., can be written as convex combinations of product states.

This technique allows one to obtain simple conditions for separability which involve only local measurements made by each party involved in the system under consideration. However, these results do not apply directly when dealing with mixed states since they require the knowledge of all possible pure-state decompositions of such states. Here we will use another version of the Bloch representation [7] to derive a general criterion for separability applicable also to mixed states. Our main result consists of showing that there exists at least one decomposition into pure states compatible with the Bloch representation of every separable state. As a consequence, we prove that the criterion presented here constitutes a necessary condition for separabilty which is strictly weaker than previous ones [8] .\nPreliminaries:-In what follows we consider N-partite systems described by Hilbert spaces H 1 ,H 2 ...H N .

We show how these kernels can be obtained from the solution of a linear integral equation whose kernel has been derived using the method of images. This allows us to derive explicit expressions for all higher order correlation functions at any time t > 0. In particular, this yields exact formulas for the pair distribution function and the velocity autocorrelation function. Finally, we discuss some possible extensions of our results.

These models have attracted considerable interest over many years due to their relevance both in mathematics (e.g., integrable systems) and physics (e.g., geophysical fluid dynamics). They describe the motion of N identical point vortices located at positions $\\mathbf{r}_i$ moving under mutual interaction forces given by the Biot-Savart law. For simplicity, let us assume that the initial configuration consists only of circularly symmetric vortex patches centered around the points $\\mathbf{r}_i(0)$. Then it follows immediately from Kelvin's theorem that the trajectories remain circularly symmetric during the whole evolution. Moreover, if the total circulation $\\Gamma = \\sum_{i=1}^N \\gamma_i$ remains constant then the centers of mass will move along straight lines with constant velocities. Thus, without loss of generality one may restrict oneself to configurations where the center of mass moves along the x-axis with speed $v_0$ and the individual circulations are equal to $-\\gamma_0$."}

Consider the following evolution equation for metrics $g_t$ on $M$:  $$\\displaystyle g_{t+1} = e^{-2tH_g}g_t$$ where $H_g$ denotes the mean curvature vector field of the hypersurface $M^n$ equipped with the metric $g$. This is called the Ricci-DeTurck flow [DeT84], since it can also be written as:  $$\\displaystyle g^{ij}_{t} = e^{-2tH_{g}}g^{ij}_0 + 2e^{-2tH_{g}}\\Gamma_{ij}^{k}\\nabla_k \\log g_{0j}$$ Here, $\\Gamma_{ij}^{k}$ denote the Christoffel symbols associated to the metric $g$.

We show how this method can be used to generate families of black hole solutions with different horizon topologies. In particular we find new rotating black ring solutions with toroidal horizons.

INTRODUCTORY REMARkS\nThe study of exact solutions to the Einstein equations has played a crucial role in understanding many aspects of general relativity. However, it is often difficult to construct such solutions because they require solving complicated nonlinear partial differential equations. This problem becomes even more challenging when considering physically interesting situations like those involving rotation and\/or matter fields. Nevertheless, there exist several techniques that allow one to generate new classes of solutions starting from simpler ones. One of the most powerful methods involves transforming the original solution into another one via so-called nonholonomic frame transforms [1] . Such transformations preserve certain geometric properties of the spacetime while changing others; see [2] - [4] for reviews. For example, if the transformed solution satisfies the vacuum Einstein equations then so does the original one [5] .\nIn this work we apply nonholonomic frame transforms to known vacuum solutions of the Einstein equations in order to generate new exact solutions describing stationary axisymmetric spacetimes: i.e., spacetimes admitting at least two independent Killing vector fields whose orbits are closed curves [6] . Stationary axisymmetric spacetimes play an important role in astrophysics since they describe the exterior gravitational field of spinning objects like stars, planets, and black holes [7, 8]"}

For example, we find that Kepler-62f has a minimum possible spin period of about 8 days if it orbits in the same plane as its host star; otherwise, its spin period could be up to 20 days. This result suggests that Kepler-62f may have a large spin-orbit misalignment angle.

It was first introduced into the context of quantum information theory [5] where it measures the amount of correlations among different parts of a system [6] .\nIn recent years, the entanglement entropy has attracted much attention due to its close relation to the gravitational dual description [7, 8] . For example, the entanglement entropy of a CFT state corresponds to the area of minimal surface in the bulk geometry [9] . This remarkable discovery led to many interesting applications including the calculation of the central charge [10] , the proof of c-theorem [11] , the investigation of phase transitions [12] , etc.. However, most of these studies are restricted to static backgrounds or time-independent situations. Recently, several attempts have been made to generalize the concept of entanglement entropy to dynamical cases [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50"}
{"text":"We study the nonlinear perturbations of general relativity (GR) and other metric theories of gravity, focusing on their effects on conserved quantities such as energy-momentum tensors. We show that these perturbations can be decomposed into two parts: one is associated with the background geometry while another is related to the perturbation itself. In particular, we find that for any given background solution there exists an infinite number of solutions corresponding to different values of the conserved quantity. This implies that the conservation laws are not preserved under small perturbations. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this effect may lead to violations of the weak equivalence principle. Finally, we discuss possible implications of our results for cosmology and black hole physics. General relativity (GR), which describes gravitational interactions at large scales, has been tested extensively against observations over many decades [1] . However, it remains unclear whether or not GR also holds true at smaller length scales where quantum mechanics becomes important [2] .\nIn order to address this question, several alternative theories have been proposed [3] , including scalar-tensor theories [4] , f(R)-gravity [5] , massive gravity [6] , and so forth [7, 8] . These theories typically involve additional degrees of freedom beyond those present in GR [9] . For example, in scalar-tensor theories, the graviton acquires a mass through its coupling to a scalar field [10] . Similarly, in f(R)-theories [11] , the Einstein-Hilbert action contains higher-order curvature terms [12] .

A particularly interesting application of these ideas involves studying non-conformal theories using their dual description in terms of gravitational backgrounds [3, 4] .\nIn order to construct such models it is necessary to solve the equations of motion associated with the relevant supergravity or gauged supergravity theory. This problem becomes more tractable when considering specific classes of solutions preserving some fraction of the original supersymmetry [5] , since only certain combinations of fields may then appear [6] . For example, if one considers configurations preserving all but one of the original supersymmetries (BPS states), then the resulting system will depend upon just five scalar fields [7, 8] . However, even in this case finding explicit solutions remains difficult [9] .\nOne approach to solving BPS-type problems is to consider special cases where the geometry admits additional symmetries [10] .

The proposed mechanism is also able to accelerate protons up to energies beyond 10^20 eV without violating current observational constraints on the diffuse fluxes of high-energy neutrinos or photons produced during the acceleration process. This scenario provides an explanation for the origin of ultra-high energy cosmic rays as well as for the production of the highest energy neutrinos detected so far.

{"text":"We present the results of our numerical simulations of accreting black holes in which we have included general relativistic effects and radiative transfer using Monte Carlo techniques. We find that for low mass (M < 10 M_sun) black holes, there is an inner edge to the disk at about 3 Schwarzschild radii where the density drops sharply by several orders of magnitude. The temperature profile shows a sharp rise near this radius due to compression as well as heating by viscous dissipation. For higher masses (10 M_sun < M < 100 M_sun), the disks are optically thick throughout their extent with no clear evidence of any inner edge. In these cases, the temperature profiles show a gradual increase towards smaller radii. Finally, for very massive black holes (M > 100 M_sun), we find that the disks become geometrically thin but remain optically thick out to large distances."}

{"text":"We study the exact Floquet states of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) in an optical lattice under periodic driving, which is realized by periodically modulating the depth of the optical potential. We show that there are two types of Floquet states depending on whether they have zero or nonzero quasienergies. The former ones correspond to the usual Bloch bands while the latter ones represent the so-called Floquet-Bloch bands. In particular, we find that the Floquet-Bloch band structure can be obtained as a result of hybridization between different Bloch bands with opposite momenta. Furthermore, we investigate how these Floquet states evolve when the system parameters change. Finally, we discuss the stability properties of the Floquet states against small perturbations. Our results provide useful insights into the physics of periodically-driven quantum systems. Introduction:-Recent experimental advances allow for realizing artificial gauge fields [1] , synthetic dimensions [2] , topological phases [3] , and even time crystals [4] . These fascinating phenomena are usually observed in ultracold atomic gases trapped in optical lattices [5] .\nIn this work, we consider a Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC) confined in such a one-dimensional (1D) optical lattice [6] . By applying external laser beams [7, 8] , it is possible to create a periodic modulation of the optical potential [9] . This leads to a periodic variation of the hopping amplitude J(t), which plays the role of a time-dependent Peierls phase [10] . As a consequence, the effective Hamiltonian describing our system becomes time-periodic [11] . It has been shown recently [12] that the corresponding Schr\u00f6dinger equation admits solutions known as Floquet states [13] . They describe the evolution of the wave function over one period T = 2\u03c0\/\u03c9 0 where \u03c9 0 denotes the frequency of the periodic drive [14] . Since the Floquet states are not stationary but rather oscillate at the same frequency as the drive [15] , they may exhibit interesting physical features [16] .

This interest was triggered mainly by the discovery of new phenomena in this area made possible by the advent of accelerators operating at TeV scale such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [2] . These discoveries include the observation of rapid growth of total cross sections [3] , dip-bump structure [4] , forward-backward asymmetry [5] , etc.. It should be noted however that many important questions remain open concerning the nature of the underlying dynamics responsible for all these effects [6] .\n \nIn particular, it remains unclear whether they can be explained within the conventional Regge theory [7, 8] or require more complicated approaches like those involving unitarization [9] and\/or saturation [10] mechanisms. Another interesting question concerns the role played by higher-order corrections in perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). Indeed, while the leading order BFKL [11] and DGLAP [12] equations provide reasonable description of experimental data [13] , their next-to-leading order extensions [14, 15] lead to significant deviations [16] which may indicate the need for resummation techniques [17] . \n \n 2 Data Analysis \n \n To shed some light on these issues we have performed detailed study of available data on elastic scattering processes collected recently by two dedicated experiments -the TOTEM [18] and UA7 [19] collaborations.

{"text":"We study the dynamical friction (DF) experienced by an orbiting perturber moving on circular orbits embedded into a gaseous medium with density $\\rho$ and temperature $T$ . We find that for small values of the Mach number, $Ma \\ll 1$ , DF is suppressed due to pressure effects. For larger Mach numbers we recover the standard Chandrasekhar formula for DF. In addition, we show that the dependence of DF on the Mach number can be approximated as $$F_D = F_{Chandra}(1 - Ma^2)^{1\/2}$$ .\nThis result has important consequences for the orbital evolution of satellites around galaxies or stars around black holes. The effect of this suppression may also have implications for the formation of massive black hole binaries via gravitational wave emission. Dynamical friction plays an important role in many astrophysical systems such as satellite galaxies orbiting their host galaxy, planets orbiting their star, or even binary black holes merging through gravitational waves. It describes how the motion of one object affects another object which moves relative to it.

{"text":"We study the shear viscosity and thermal conductivity of an inelastic Maxwell gas with variable mass ratio, by using kinetic theory methods. We show that both transport coefficients are proportional to the square root of the mean free path between collisions. The dependence on the mass ratio is found to be weak when the masses differ significantly but strong if they are similar. In particular we find that the shear viscosity decreases as the mass ratio increases while the opposite happens for the thermal conductivity. \n \n Introduction \n \n Transport properties such as the shear viscosity and thermal conduction play important roles in many physical phenomena ranging from astrophysics [1] , geophysical flows [2] or plasma physics [3] . These quantities depend strongly on the microscopic dynamics of the system under consideration [4] . For example, it has been shown recently [5] that the shear viscosity of granular gases depends crucially on whether particles can bounce off each other after colliding elastically [6] .\n \nIn this work we consider a model consisting of two species of particles which interact via binary elastic collisions [7, 8] . Each particle belongs either to one of these species (A) or to another species (B). Particles belonging to different species do not interact directly; however their motion is coupled indirectly through the presence of a background fluid. This situation arises naturally in mixtures where there exists a large difference in size and\/or mass between the components [9] . It also occurs in systems composed of heavy ions immersed in a lighter neutralizing electron gas [10] . \n \n A simple way to describe the interaction between particles of type A and B is given by the so-called inelastic Maxwell model [11] . Here particles of type A have constant mass m0 and those of type B change continuously during time evolution according to some prescribed rule [12] . As a result, the total number of particles N = NA + NB fluctuates around its average value <N> = n0V, where V denotes the volume occupied by the mixture.

{"text":"We study the relaxation dynamics of suspensions of platelike colloids by means of Brownian Dynamics simulations and experiments on polystyrene platelets suspended in water. We find that the decay of the intermediate scattering function is nonexponential, with an initial fast decay followed by a slower one. The slowest mode has been identified as the collective diffusion of the suspension. By comparing our results to those obtained for spherical colloids we show how the shape anisotropy affects the relaxation process. In particular, we observe that the presence of flat surfaces enhances the effect of hydrodynamic interactions between neighboring particles leading to faster relaxation times than expected based on simple scaling arguments. Finally, we discuss possible applications of these systems as model soft matter systems for studying glass transitions. Colloidal dispersions are widely used as model systems for understanding phenomena such as phase separation or gel formation [1] . However, most studies have focused on spherical particles [2] , while only few works have considered non-spherical shapes [3] .\nIn this work we investigate the relaxation dynamics of suspentions of platelike colloidals using both computer simulation techniques and experimental measurements. Platelike colloids can be realized experimentally by suspending polystyrene-platelet-like particles [4] into water (see Fig.  1 ). These systems exhibit interesting properties which make them suitable candidates for investigating fundamental physical processes like glass transition [5] . For example, they display enhanced viscosity [6] compared to their spherical counterparts [7, 8] due to the increased friction arising from the interaction of the particle's flat surface with its neighbors [9] . Moreover, it was recently shown [10] that platelike colloids undergo a structural arrest at higher volume fractions than spherical ones [11] . This behavior is reminiscent of what observed in hard-sphere glasses [12] but also in other types of amorphous solids [13] where the local structure displays icosahedral order [14] ."}

For smaller masses we find unstable solitonic solutions whose lifetime decreases exponentially as the mass ratio approaches one. The results presented here can be used to constrain the parameter space of such models using astrophysical observations. Introduction:-The possibility of new physics beyond the Standard Model (SM) has been widely discussed recently [1] . In particular, there have been many attempts at constructing extensions of the SM that include additional fields or interactions [2] , motivated by the fact that none of its fundamental parameters have yet been measured experimentally [3] .\nIn this work we consider an extension of the SM where the Higgs sector consists of two complex scalars [4] . This model contains several interesting features including spontaneous CP violation [5] , radiative electroweak symmetry breaking [6] , and the presence of a pseudo-Goldstone boson [7, 8] . It also provides a simple framework within which to discuss possible connections between dark matter [9] and neutrino masses [10] . Furthermore it allows us to explore the phenomenology associated with the production of heavy neutral gauge bosons [11] and their subsequent decay into pairs of charged leptons [12] . Finally, it may provide a natural explanation for the origin of baryogenesis [13] through the out-of-equilibrium decays of the heavier scalar [14] .\nOne feature of these models is the presence of a second scalar particle, denoted by H 0 , which mixes with the SM-like Higgs h 0 [15] . As a result, both states acquire physical masses m h0 and m H0 respectively [16] . If the mixing angle \u03b8H is small then mH \u226b mh [17] . However, even when mH = mh, the couplings of the two scalars differ significantly due to the different quantum numbers carried by each state [18] ."}

{"text":"We present new results on photolysis-induced chemistry in the upper atmosphere of Titan, based on observations made by Cassini\/VIMS (Visible Infrared Mapping Spectrometer) during its T5 flyby of Titan's northern hemisphere. The VIMS data show that there is an extensive haze layer between about 400 km altitude and 1000 km above the surface. This haze has been previously attributed to photochemical production of aerosol particles through reactions involving methane and ethane. We find evidence for additional sources of aerosol particles at higher altitudes. These include products of dissociation of nitrogen molecules produced by solar UV radiation, as well as carbon dioxide and water vapor released from the lower stratosphere into the mesosphere\/thermosphere region. Our analysis suggests that these processes may be responsible for up to 50% of the total mass loading of the haze observed near 600 km altitude.

In order to achieve high extinction ratio in this MMI-based beam splitter we use a novel design that incorporates a tapered region at its input port. We demonstrate a maximum extinction ratio of more than 40 dB between both arms of our interferometer by adjusting the phase difference between them. This value corresponds to a minimum intensity contrast of 1e-10 which is sufficient for most applications such as space telescopes or free-space optical communication systems.

The problem arises because we can not understand how Hawking radiation escapes from a black hole without violating unitarity or causality. Recently, it was shown that this problem may be solved by assuming the existence of an underlying theory with general covariance and local Lorentz invariance. However, there are still some open questions about whether such a theory exists. Here I will show that if we assume the existence of such a theory then we must accept the incompleteness theorem proposed by G\\\"odel.

(1962) opened up an exciting new field for astrophysics and led to the development of many important concepts such as accretion disks around compact objects.  The study of these systems has been revolutionized with the launch of Chandra and XMM-Newton observatories which have allowed us to probe their physical properties on unprecedented spatial scales.   In this review we will discuss some recent results obtained using these satellites that shed light on how neutron stars are formed and evolve within low-mass binary systems. We will also present our current understanding of the physics behind the formation of relativistic jets observed in several classes of X-ray binaries. Finally, we will briefly describe the prospects offered by future missions like XEUS or Constellation-X for studying these fascinating sources.

{"text":"We study theoretically the emission and absorption noise for electrons moving along chiral edge states in the integer and fractional quantum Hall effects (QHE). We show that, at low temperatures, the shot noise is suppressed by the presence of counter-propagating edge channels with opposite spins. The suppression factor depends on the filling fraction and can be as large as 0.5. In addition to this spin dependent contribution we find an additional term which arises due to backscattering between counterpropagating edge modes. This term leads to a reduction of the total current fluctuations even when there are no spin-flip processes present. Finally, we discuss how our results could be tested experimentally using microwave techniques. Introduction:-The quantization of conductance observed in semiconductor two-dimensional electron systems has been one of the most exciting discoveries in condensed matter physics during recent years [1] . It was found that the conductance G through such samples shows plateaus at values given by 2e 2 \/h = h\/(e * l), where e * denotes the effective charge carried by each electron and l is the magnetic length [2] .\nIn parallel to these experiments it became clear that the transport properties of QHE devices are not only determined by their bulk electronic structure but also depend crucially on the nature of the edges [3] . For example, the longitudinal resistance R xx vanishes if the sample width W becomes smaller than some critical value [4] , while the transverse resistance R xy remains unchanged [5] . Furthermore, the temperature dependence of both resistances changes dramatically [6] : While R xx decreases exponentially towards zero below T c \u2248 1 K, R xy increases linearly with decreasing temperature [7, 8] . These observations have led to the development of the so-called \"edge state picture\" [9] according to which the system consists of two counter-propagating edge currents carrying opposite spins [10] . A number of theoretical models were proposed to explain the experimental findings [11] - [16] . However, despite considerable efforts [17] - [20] , so far none of them seems to provide a complete description of all available data [21] ."}
{"text":"We propose to use thermal noise as the information carrier for totally secure communications, zero power consumption devices, and computing systems. We show that by using an appropriate detection scheme, we can extract digital bits from the thermal noise with high fidelity at room temperature. The proposed system is based on a single-electron transistor (SET) which has been demonstrated in experiments recently. In addition, we demonstrate how this SET-based device can be used to perform logic operations such as AND gate and NOT gate. Finally, we discuss possible applications of our proposal including quantum key distribution, ultra-low power sensor networks, and energy efficient data centers. This work was supported by NSF under Grant No. ECCS-0926491. A new paradigm called \"thermal noise informatics\" is introduced where thermal noise is utilized as the information carrier for various tasks ranging from totally secure communication over wires to zero-power communication and computation. By employing an appropriate detection scheme, it is shown that one can extract digital bits from thermal noise with high fidelities even at room temperatures. It is also shown that these extracted digital bits can be used to perform logical operations such as AND gates and NOT gates. Possible applications are discussed along with their advantages compared to existing technologies."}
{"text":"We present forecasts for cosmological constraints on dark energy parameters using galaxy clusters, weak lensing tomography, and supernovae data in combination with Planck CMB temperature anisotropy measurements. We use an approximate treatment to account for all relevant covariances between these probes. The results are presented as two-dimensional marginalized likelihoods over pairs of dark energy parameters. Forecasted errors on w0 and wa range from 0.01-0.02 at 1-sigma confidence level (CL) when combining all three probes together. This is comparable or better than current state-of-the-art constraints obtained by other authors. In addition we show that our method can be used to obtain joint constraints on additional parameters such as neutrino masses. Finally, we demonstrate how this approach could be extended to include more complicated models beyond simple flat \u039bCDM scenarios. We also discuss possible extensions of our analysis which would allow us to improve upon existing constraints further."}
{"text":"We present an empirical consistency test for dark energy models based on the growth rate of large-scale structure and its dependence on cosmological parameters, including the equation-of-state parameter w{\\displaystyle w}. We use data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to measure the evolution of clustering in galaxy samples with different luminosities at redshifts z=0.1\u20130.7. The results are compared against predictions made using two classes of dark energy model: (i) quintessence scalar fields that evolve slowly over time and (ii) modified gravity theories where the gravitational force is mediated by additional degrees of freedom beyond those predicted by general relativity. Our analysis shows no evidence for deviations from standard gravity or quintessence-like behavior within current observational uncertainties. This result provides further support for the concordance model of cosmology as well as constraining power for future experiments such as Euclid. Introduction \n \n In recent years there has been considerable interest in testing whether modifications to Einstein's theory of general relativity can explain observations of cosmic acceleration [1\u20133] . A number of theoretical frameworks have been proposed which modify gravity on large scales while remaining consistent with local tests of gravity [4\u20136] , but it remains unclear if these theories will be able to reproduce all observed phenomena [7\u20139] . \n \n Here we consider one class of modified gravity theories known as f(R)-gravity [10\u201312] , where the gravitational action contains higher-order curvature terms.

{"text":"We investigate the effect of intrinsic galaxy alignment (IA) on dark energy parameter constraints using weak lensing tomography with future space-based surveys, such as Euclid and WFIRST. We find that IA introduces significant biases in cosmological parameters when only spectroscopic redshifts are available for calibration purposes. However, we show that these biases can be reduced by including photometric redshifts to calibrate the IA model. In particular, we demonstrate that it is possible to reduce the bias due to IA down to less than 1% level if at least 10 bands spanning 0.4-1 micron are used for photo-z estimation. This requirement becomes more stringent towards higher redshifts where the number density of galaxies decreases rapidly. The results presented here will help guide the design of future experiments aiming to measure dark energy through weak gravitational lensing. Introduction - Weak gravitational lensing has emerged as one of the most promising probes of dark energy [1-3]. It measures the distortion of distant galaxy images caused by intervening large-scale structure along the line-of-sight [4] . By measuring this distortion over a wide range of angular scales, one can reconstruct the three-dimensional matter distribution in the Universe [5] , which contains information about both the geometry of the universe and its growth rate [6] .\nIn order to extract useful cosmological information from weak lensing data, accurate measurements of the shapes of background galaxies must first be obtained [7-9]. These shape measurements then need to be corrected for distortions induced by atmospheric effects [10] , telescope optics [11] , and point spread function [12] . Finally, they also have to be corrected for distorted shapes introduced by foreground structures [13] . Intrinsic galaxy alignments (IAs), i.e., correlations between galaxy orientations [14] or positions [15] , introduce additional systematic errors into the measured shear correlation functions [16] . If not properly accounted for, IAs could lead to biased estimates of cosmological parameters [17] .\nSeveral methods have been proposed to mitigate the effect of IAs on cosmological parameter estimations [18] . One approach involves modeling the observed galaxy ellipticities as a combination of intrinsic"}
{"text":"We present the results of an analysis of binary microlens light curves that are not caustic crossing events, using simulated data and real observations. We find that these light curves can be well described by a simple model consisting of two point sources with finite sizes and uniform surface brightnesses separated by a circular lensing mass distribution. The parameters describing this model include the separation between the components in units of Einstein radii (s), their relative flux ratio (), and the source size (). In addition to fitting for these four parameters simultaneously, we also fit for the time at which each event peaks () as a fifth parameter. Using simulated data sets generated from our model, we show how the uncertainties on these five parameters depend upon the signal-to-noise ratio of the observed light curve. Finally, we apply our method to three binary microlensing events recently discovered toward the Large Magellanic Cloud. These events were found through systematic searches of archival images taken by the MACHO and OGLE collaborations."}
{"text":"We propose an alternative approach to topological insulators based on the concept of Chern parity, which is defined as the product of all occupied bands in momentum space and can be viewed as a generalization of the Z2 index for time-reversal invariant systems. We show that this quantity has several useful properties such as being gauge independent and robust against disorder. In particular we demonstrate how it allows one to define new classes of topological insulators with nontrivial topology even when the system does not have inversion symmetry or time reversal invariance. Finally, we discuss possible experimental realizations using ultracold atoms trapped in optical lattices. Topological insulators are materials whose bulk states are insulating but their edges support gapless excitations protected by certain symmetries [1] . The most prominent example is provided by two-dimensional (2D) quantum spin Hall insulators [2] , where the edge states carry a single Dirac fermion per unit cell [3] .\nThe existence of these exotic states relies crucially on the presence of either timereversal [4] or particle-hole [5] symmetry. However, there exist other types of topological phases [6] characterized by different kinds of order parameters [7, 8] . For instance, 2D topological superconductors [9] are described by Majorana zero modes [10] while 3D Weyl semimetals [11] host chiral Fermi arcs [12] at their surfaces [13] . These novel phenomena cannot be captured within the standard classification scheme [14, 15] relying only on time-reversal and\/or inversion symmetry [16] .\nIn this Letter, we introduce a new class of topological insulators [17] based on the concept of \"Chern parity\" [18] , which is defined as the sum over all occupied bands in reciprocal space [19] \nwhere |u nk \u27e9 denotes the Bloch wavefunction corresponding to band n and crystal momentum k. This quantity plays a central role in our analysis since it provides a natural generalization of the Z 2 index [20] characterizing time-reversal invariant topological insulators [21] . Indeed, if the system preserves both time-reversal T and inversion P symmetries then C = 1 mod 4 [22] . On"}
{"text":"We report the first experimental demonstration of two-electron interference in an electron microscope, using a novel technique to produce and detect entangled pairs of spatially separated electrons. The experiment is performed on a single atomically thin carbon layer deposited onto a silicon nitride membrane with a hole drilled through it. We observe that when one electron passes through the hole while its partner travels along a nearby path outside the hole, they interfere destructively at the detector placed behind the hole. This destructive interference effect can be explained by considering the phase difference acquired during propagation due to their different paths lengths. Our results demonstrate how quantum mechanical effects are manifested in real space as well as in momentum space. \n \n Quantum mechanics predicts that particles may exhibit nonlocal correlations even if they never interact directly. In particular, this implies that the wave function describing each particle must contain information about all other particles involved in the system. Such nonlocality has been demonstrated for photons1\u20133 but not yet for massive particles such as electrons or atoms4\u20136. Here we show experimentally that two electrons emitted simultaneously from opposite sides of a double-slit aperture do indeed interfere with each other despite being separated by more than 1 mm7."}
{"text":"We present the results of our study on chemical composition, molecular line emission, dust properties, and thermal balance in dense cores with metallicities ranging between 1\/100 solar to 1\/10 000 solar. We find that the gas temperature decreases by about 10 K as the core density increases for all metallicities studied here (1\/100-1\/10 000 solar). The decrease is more rapid than predicted by current models which assume constant temperatures throughout the cloud evolution. This may be due to an increase in the importance of grain-surface chemistry relative to gas-phase reactions at higher densities. In addition we find evidence for significant depletion of carbon onto grains even at high metallicities such as Z = 1\/10 000 solar. Our observations suggest that the critical density above which CO becomes optically thick depends strongly on metallicity. At lower metallicities this occurs at higher densities compared to higher metallicities. Finally, we show that the observed abundance ratios are consistent with those expected if the clouds were initially chemically enriched by supernovae type II explosions."}

{"text":"We study the effect of temperature dependent shape anisotropy in an exchange coupled system consisting of two identical uniaxial single domain particles, one being magnetically softer than the other and both having their easy axes parallel to each other. We show that for certain values of the parameters involved there is a significant increase in the coercive field at low temperatures compared to high temperatures. This can be understood by considering the competition between the Zeeman energy barrier due to the applied magnetic field and the thermal activation energy barrier associated with the temperature dependence of the shape anisotropy. \n \n The model we consider consists of two identical spherical particles (with radius R) separated by a distance d along the z-axis.

{"text":"We present the results of our calculation on rotating condensate in an optical trap using cranked HFB method with Skyrme interaction.  We have found that there is no phase transition between superfluid and normal state as predicted by mean field theory, but we find that the condensate density decreases continuously when angular velocity increases. The decrease rate depends strongly on the strength of the pairing force. This result can be explained by the fact that the rotation breaks the Cooper pairs into single particles which are not bound together any more. In addition to this effect, we also observe another interesting phenomenon; namely, the condensate density becomes larger at some specific values of angular velocities than its value without rotation. This may be understood as follows: At these special points, the system has lower energy due to the presence of vortex lines. Finally, we compare our results with those obtained by other authors who used different methods such as time-dependent GP equation or Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations."}
{"text":"The rate at which new mutations are fixed in populations is determined by the balance between natural selection and genetic drift, but how these forces interact to shape the evolution of proteins remains poorly understood.  Here we show that neutral genetic drift can accelerate the fixation of beneficial mutations within genes encoding functionally important regions of proteins. We used deep mutational scanning to measure the fitness effects of all possible single amino acid substitutions for two enzymes (T4 lysozyme and TEM-1 \u03b2-lactamase) across their entire sequence space. By combining this data with population genetics simulations, we found that neutral genetic drift increased the probability of fixing beneficial mutations in both enzymes' active sites. This effect was particularly pronounced when the number of adaptive mutations available per generation was low or when there were many competing deleterious mutations. Our results suggest that neutral genetic drift may play an underappreciated role in shaping the evolution of proteins."}
{"text":"The topological classification of clusters is reviewed, with emphasis on the role played by symmetry and topology in determining cluster structures.  The concept of \"topology\" refers to the connectivity between atoms or molecules within a cluster; it can be used as an organizing principle for classifying clusters into families based upon their structural similarities. This review focuses primarily on metal clusters (i.e., clusters containing one or more metallic elements), but also discusses some examples of non-metallic clusters that have been studied recently. In addition, we briefly discuss how this approach has been applied to classify clusters formed during chemical reactions. Finally, we present several open questions related to the topic of cluster topology. Topology plays an important role in understanding the structure of matter at all scales ranging from atomic nuclei to macroscopic materials such as crystals. It provides a useful framework for classifying clusters according to their structural similarity. Herein, we provide a brief overview of recent progress made towards developing a systematic classification scheme for clusters using concepts borrowed from condensed-matter physics."}
{"text":"We present an algorithm for creating a hierarchical grid spatial index using images as the basis for its construction.  The algorithm is based on the observation that many real-world datasets are naturally represented by images, and can be used in conjunction with existing techniques such as R-tree or Quadtree to improve performance.   We show how our technique performs against these other methods through experiments conducted over synthetic data sets generated according to different distributions (uniform, normal, exponential) and sizes ranging between 1K and 100M points.   Our results demonstrate significant improvements in query response times when compared to traditional approaches. In this work we propose a new approach for building a spatial index which uses image processing algorithms to extract information about the dataset being indexed. This information is then used to build a hierarchy of grids whose leaf nodes contain pointers to individual objects within the dataset. These grids provide efficient access to all objects contained therein while also allowing fast queries across multiple grids at once."}

We focus our attention on the so-called Bir-Aronov-Pikuz mechanism which is responsible for spin-flip transitions between conduction-band states with different orbital angular momenta. The main results are summarized below.  For bulk materials we find that the dominant contribution comes from intra-valley scattering processes involving heavy-hole bands. This result agrees well with previous theoretical studies performed within effective-mass approximations. However, by using realistic band-structure calculations we show that inter-valley contributions can also play an important role when considering DQWs grown along non [001] directions. Finally, we discuss how these findings could be used to improve existing models describing spin relaxation times in semiconductor nanostructures."}
{"text":"We study the statistical properties of the local order parameter in systems undergoing a continuous phase transition, when quenched disorder is present. We show that these are described by a generalized multifractal spectrum which depends on both the strength and type of disorder as well as on the universality class of the clean system.

The results obtained for this model can be applied to describe the behavior of interfaces near wetting transitions in presence of quenched disorder.

INTRODUCTORY REMARK\nThe aim of this paper is to investigate how the presence of quenched impurities affects the statistical properties of the order-parameter fluctuations close to a continuous phase transition point. Our main interest will be focused on the so-called \"random fixed-points\" (RFP) [1] , i.e., those points where the renormalization-group flow of an effective field theory describing the effect of disorder stops because it becomes unstable against small perturbations [2] .\nIn general RFPs do not correspond to any physical situation since they represent singularities of the RG flows; however there exist some cases where such singularity appears only after many orders of perturbation expansion have been resummed [3] . For example, if the disorder distribution has a finite variance then the corresponding RFP corresponds to a stable fixed point [4] ; therefore its effects should appear only beyond all orders in perturbation theory [5] . On the other hand, if the disorder distribution is broad enough so that its moments diverge, then the RFP represents a genuine non-perturbative phenomenon [6] ."}
{"text":"We report on the evaporation of buffer-gas thermalized ions in a linear quadrupole ion trap (QIT). The QIT is filled with helium buffer gas at pressures between 0 and 1 mbar, which leads to temperatures up to 1000 K for trapped ions. We evaporate the ions by lowering the temperature of the surrounding helium bath down to 300 K within less than one second. This results in a significant reduction of the number density inside the QIT without affecting its trapping properties significantly. In this way we are able to reduce the number of stored ions by more than two orders of magnitude while keeping their kinetic energy below 10 eV per charge state. Our experimental findings agree well with theoretical predictions based on rate equations describing the time evolution of the number densities of all relevant species involved. \n \n Introduction \n \n Multipole radio-frequency ion traps have been used extensively over the past decades as mass spectrometers [1] . They provide high resolution and sensitivity [2] , but they suffer from space-charge effects when storing large numbers of ions [3] . Space charge can be reduced by cooling the ions [4] or by removing them selectively [5] . Cooling requires sophisticated laser systems [6] that may not always be available. Selective removal has been demonstrated using pulsed electric fields [7, 8] , collisions with neutral atoms [9] , photoionization [10] , electron impact ionization [11] , and resonant photodissociation [12] .\n \nIn our experiment, we use selective removal via rapid heating of the helium buffer gas [13] . Heating the helium causes the ions to lose their kinetic energy rapidly through elastic collisions [14] . As a result, the ions escape the trap volume before they gain enough energy to cause space charge problems [15] . A similar approach was recently reported [16] where the authors heated the helium buffer gas directly instead of indirectly via the ions [17] . \n \n Herein, we present detailed measurements of the process of evaporative cooling of buffer gas-thermalised ions in a linear quadrupolar ion trap (QIT) [18] . We show how the number density of the ions decreases exponentially after switching off the helium flow into the vacuum chamber containing the"}

{"text":"We study cosmological perturbations on spatially flat Friedmann-Lema\u00eetre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) backgrounds with the action for f(R) theories of gravity, where R is the Ricci scalar and R its derivative wrt to an auxiliary field $\\xi$. We show that this theory can be recast as Einstein's general relativity plus a minimally coupled scalar field $\\phi$ whose potential depends only on the scale factor $a(t)$. The evolution equations are derived by perturbing the FLRW metric around the background solution. In particular we find that the perturbation equation for the gravitational potential has exactly the same form as in standard GR but with different coefficients which depend explicitly on time through the scale factor. This implies that the growth rate of matter density fluctuations will differ from that predicted by standard GR at late times when dark energy starts dominating over matter. Finally, we discuss how these results could be used to constrain the parameters of the model using current data sets such as WMAP7 or Planck."}

The samples were designed to have an asymmetric barrier structure with different Mn concentrations at each side of the barrier. We find that the degree of spin polarization is strongly dependent on both the applied bias voltage and temperature. At low temperatures we observe large negative magnetoresistances which are attributed to spin-dependent scattering processes within the barriers. These results demonstrate that these structures can be used as efficient spin injectors into semiconductors such as Si or Ge. In recent years there has been considerable interest in developing semiconductor-based spintronic devices for applications ranging from high-density data storage systems to novel electronic components [1] . One promising approach involves using ferromagnetic materials as source\/drain contacts in field-effect transistors [2] , where the current through the device depends upon the relative alignment between the electron spins in the channel region and those in the contact regions [3] .\nIn this work we present experimental studies of spin polarized transport in GaAs\/Cd 0.9 Mn 0.1 Te\/GaAs double-barrier heterostructures grown by molecular-beam epitaxy [4] .

{"text":"The counting test facility (CTF) is an experiment at Los Alamos National Laboratory that was designed to demonstrate pulse-shape discrimination in liquid scintillator detectors for use in nuclear non-proliferation applications.  The CTF consists of two identical cylindrical tanks filled with liquid scintillator and viewed by photomultiplier tubes on opposite sides through acrylic light guides.   Each tank contains a small amount of radioactive material, which emits gamma rays when excited by neutrons produced by a pulsed neutron source located outside each detector tank.    A series of measurements were performed using different types of radioactive sources and various configurations of the CTF system.  These data are used to determine the efficiency of the CTF as well as its ability to discriminate between pulses originating from different isotopes based upon their shapes.  This report describes these results along with some preliminary studies into possible improvements to the CTF design. Pulse shape discrimination has been demonstrated in liquid scintillator experiments such as the counting test facility (CTF; see Figure 1 ). In this type of experiment, a sample containing a mixture of radioactive materials is placed inside a container surrounded by a large number of photodetectors. When a photon or particle interacts within the sample it causes emission of light photons, which travel down optical fibers towards photodetectors where they produce electrical signals proportional to the intensity of the light received. By comparing the relative amplitudes of the signal recorded by adjacent photodetectors, one can obtain information about the time profile of the emitted light pulse. If the sample contains several different radioactive species emitting light pulses with distinct profiles then the amplitude differences observed among neighboring photodetectors will be characteristic of the particular radioactive species present in the sample. For example, if there are three radioactive species present in equal proportions but producing light pulses with differing widths, then the ratio of the largest to smallest amplitude recorded by any pair of adjacent photodetectors should be 2:1:1."}
{"text":"We consider the scalar field theory on a noncommutative (NC) background with spherical symmetry and derive the NC generalization of the Klein-Gordon equation for such fields. We show that this equation can be written as an infinite set of coupled ordinary differential equations, which are equivalent to each other under certain conditions. The solutions of these equations describe different types of waves propagating along geodesics in the NC geometry. In particular we find exact solutions describing massless particles moving at the speed of light. These results may have important implications for quantum gravity phenomenology. Introduction -The idea that spacetime coordinates do not commute is one of the most intriguing concepts emerging from recent developments in string\/M-theory [1] . It has been shown [2] , however, that if one considers only classical physics then it is impossible to construct a consistent model based on this concept because of the presence of ultraviolet divergences. This problem was solved by Snyder [3] who introduced a new type of coordinate transformations leading to a deformed Poincar\u00e9 algebra [4] .\nIn order to study physical effects associated with the existence of a minimal length scale in nature, several authors considered various models where the commutator between two spatial coordinates [x i , x j ] = \u0131\u03b8 ij depends on some parameters \u03b8 ij [5] . Such deformations lead to modifications of the standard dispersion relations [6] and also affect the propagation properties of matter fields [7, 8] . For example, it has recently been suggested [9] that the introduction of a minimal length scale into the description of gravitational interactions could resolve the black hole information paradox [10] . Another interesting possibility is related to the fact that the deformation parameter \u03b8 ij can be chosen so that its magnitude decreases rapidly when the distance r increases [11] . As a result, the effect of noncommutativity becomes negligible outside a small region around the origin [12] . Thus, it seems reasonable to assume that the noncommutativity of space affects only local phenomena while leaving global ones unchanged [13] ."}
{"text":"We study the decoherence of macroscopic quantum superposition states in open systems, and show that it is possible to prepare such states with high fidelity using current experimental techniques.  We consider two different types of macroscopic superposition: coherent spin states (CSS) and Schr\u00f6dinger cat states (SCS). For CSS we find that the decay rate scales as $1\/N$ where $N$ is the number of particles involved in the state. This scaling law can be understood by considering the effect of spontaneous emission on each particle separately. In contrast for SCS the decay rate scales as $1\/sqrt(N)$ which cannot be explained by treating individual particles independently. Instead we argue that this behavior arises due to collective effects between all particles in the system. Finally, we discuss how these results could be tested experimentally. Decoherence of macroscopic superposition states has been studied extensively over recent years [1\u20133] . It was shown theoretically [4] , and confirmed experimentally [5, 6] , that macroscopic superposition states are extremely fragile against environmental noise [7, 8] . The main reason behind their fragility lies in the fact that they involve many particles, so even small interactions with an environment lead to rapid loss of coherence [9] .\nIn this work we focus on studying the decoherence process of macroscopic superposition in open systems. Specifically, we consider two different types of superposition: coherent spin states [10] and Schr\u00f6dinger cat-states [11] . Coherent spin states have already been prepared experimentally [12] while Schr\u00f6dinger cat states remain elusive [13] . However, there exist proposals for preparing them [14\u201318] , and recently some progress towards realizing them has been made [19, 20] .  Our analysis shows that both types of superposition exhibit qualitatively similar behaviour under decoherence."}

{"text":"We study the exact dimer coverings on a class of one-dimensional quantum spin systems with nearest-neighbor interactions and open boundary conditions, which are described by the Hamiltonian: \nwhere J is an arbitrary real number.  We show that there exists only one type of dimer covering in this system if J > 0 or J < -1\/2. For J = 1\/2 we find two types of dimer coverings depending on whether the total magnetization vanishes or not. The corresponding energy gaps between these different phases vanish exponentially fast as L \u2192 \u221e. \nThe results presented here can be generalized to other families of quantum spin chains. In particular, they apply also to the XXZ chain at zero magnetic field (J = 1) and to the anisotropic Heisenberg chain (J = 1\/2). Dimer coverings play an important role in statistical mechanics because they provide information about the low-energy spectrum of many-body systems [1] . They have been studied extensively over the past decades both theoretically [2] - [4] , numerically [5] - [8] , and experimentally [9] .\nIn recent years it has become possible to realize artificially designed quantum spin models using trapped ions [10] , Rydberg atoms [11] , superconducting circuits [12] , and ultracold gases [13] .

{"text":"We report on the observation and analysis of magnetic excitations in single crystals of La2CuO4 using indirect resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS). The RIXS data are compared to results obtained with neutron scattering, which show that both techniques probe similar energy scales but reveal different features due to their complementary nature. We find evidence for two distinct types of magnetic excitations at low energies: one is dispersive along the Cu-O bond direction while the other shows no dispersion within experimental resolution. These observations can be explained by considering spin waves coupled to charge fluctuations as well as localised magnons. Our study provides new insights into the low-energy physics of this prototypical cuprate compound. Introduction: Cuprates have been studied extensively over many decades because they exhibit high-temperature superconductivity [1] . Among these compounds, La2CuO4 has attracted particular attention since it was found to share several properties with more complex materials such as YBa2Cu3O7-x [2] , Bi2212 [3] or Hg1201 [4] .\nIn recent years, there has been renewed interest in studying the electronic structure of La2CuO4 [5] - [8] . This is mainly driven by the fact that its crystal structure is simpler than those of most other cuprates [9] : it consists only of copper-oxygen layers separated by lanthanum ions. Moreover, the absence of apical oxygen atoms makes it possible to grow large high-quality single crystals [10] . Finally, the presence of only one type of charge carrier allows us to investigate the intrinsic behaviour of the material without being obscured by disorder effects [11] .\nThe ground state of La2CuO4 is antiferromagnetic [12] . It exhibits an orthorhombic distortion below TN = 325 K [13] accompanied by a structural phase transition [14] . At lower temperatures, the system undergoes another phase transition [15] where the spins become ordered [16] . Despite extensive research [17] - [20] , the origin of the magnetism remains controversial [21] ."}
{"text":"We consider forward stagewise regression (FSR) for linear models with nonnegative coefficients, which is an iterative procedure that adds variables to the model one at a time until some stopping criterion is met.  We show how FSR can be used in conjunction with the monotone Lasso penalty to produce sparse solutions whose support contains all relevant predictors while simultaneously ensuring their signs are correct.  The resulting algorithm has computational complexity similar to standard Lasso algorithms but produces more accurate results on simulated data sets as well as real-world examples involving gene expression microarray data. Forward Stagewise Regression (FSR), introduced by Frank & Friedman [1] , is an iterative procedure where each iteration consists of adding a single variable into the current set of selected features based on its contribution to the objective function. This process continues until some stopping criteria is reached such as reaching a maximum number of iterations or meeting a desired level of accuracy [2] . In this work we focus on using FSR within the context of linear models with non-negative coefficients. For example, if our goal was to find genes associated with breast cancer then it would make sense to only select those genes that have been shown to increase risk rather than decrease risk [3] .\nThe main advantage of FSR over other greedy selection methods like stepwise regression [4] is that it does not require any tuning parameters [5] . However, there are two major drawbacks when applying FSR directly to problems with large numbers of potential covariates [6] :  1) It may take many iterations before the final solution converges; 2) There is no guarantee that the final solution will contain all relevant predictors. To address these issues, Tibshirani et al. [7] proposed the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (Lasso). Lasso solves the following optimization problem:"}
{"text":"We propose to cool fermionic atoms in optical lattices by using the pairing mechanism between two different hyperfine states, which is analogous to Cooper pair formation in superconductors. We show that this method can be used for both bosonic and fermionic systems with attractive interactions. The proposed scheme has several advantages over other methods such as evaporative cooling or sympathetic cooling.  It does not require any additional laser beams besides those needed for trapping and manipulating cold atoms. In addition it works even when there are no free particles present initially (e.g., at zero temperature). Finally we discuss how our proposal could be realized experimentally. Cooling fermions down to quantum degeneracy temperatures below 1 microkelvin remains one of the most challenging problems in atomic physics today [1] . This problem becomes particularly difficult if the initial number density of fermions is high because then elastic collisions cannot remove enough energy from the system [2] .\nIn recent years, however, new experimental techniques have been developed [3, 4] , allowing us to trap and manipulate cold atoms on an unprecedented level [5] . These developments make it possible to study many-body phenomena [6] like superfluidity [7, 8] and Bose-Einstein condensation [9] in ultracold atomic gases. One important goal in these experiments is to reach quantum degenerate regimes where the gas consists of strongly interacting fermions [10] . However, reaching low temperatures requires efficient cooling schemes [11] .\nOne promising approach towards achieving this goal is to use the pairing mechanism [12] . Pairs of fermions form bound states called Cooper pairs in conventional superconductors [13] . Analogously, pairs of fermions may also form bound states in ultracold atomic clouds [14] . If the interaction strength between fermions is sufficiently large, they will preferentially bind into pairs rather than remaining unpaired [15] . Therefore, cooling fermions via pairing should work well even"}
{"text":"We report on our near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopic observations of the nearby G0V star HD75289, which is known to have an M dwarf companion at 0.3 AU with a mass ratio q = 0.1 and orbital period P orb = 3 yr. We observed this system in 2005-2007 using NIRSPEC mounted on Keck II telescope. The radial velocity measurements show that there are two peaks separated by ~100 km\/sec in the cross correlation function between the target spectrum and template spectra of different spectral types ranging from F-type to T-type stars. These results suggest that we may be seeing double lines due to the presence of another object in addition to the M dwarf companion. However, it should also be noted that these features could arise as a result of stellar activity or pulsations. \n \n In order to confirm whether the second peak seen in the CCFs arises from the presence of additional companions around HD75289, we carried out high resolution imaging observation using AO188+CORONAS-PHOTON mated with Subaru Telescope.

The spatial distribution of star formation rate density is also consistent with this picture.

In addition, we identify several flaring galaxies which show strong [O iii]\u03bb5007 line emissions in their spectra taken by HST\/ACS grism.

Second, we develop efficient iterative algorithms for solving large-scale convex optimization problems involving sparsity-promoting regularizers.  These algorithms combine ideas from compressed sensing theory and recent results about the convergence rate of alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)."}
{"text":"We present the results of an analysis to determine rates, masses, spins, and luminosities for intermediate mass ratio inspiral (IMRI) events detectable with advanced gravitational wave detectors such as Advanced LIGO.

The simulated systems evolve through three phases: detached phase, Roche lobe overflow phase, and common envelope phase. In our simulation we assume that all stars have solar metallicity and initial spin periods of 10 days. For each system generated, we calculate its signal-to-noise ratio using the stationary phase approximation. We find that there will be about one event per year within 100 Mpc with signal-to-noise ratios greater than 8. This is comparable to the rate expected for double neutron star mergers. However, unlike double neutron star mergers which occur at high redshifts, most IMRI events should be detected nearby."}

It has been in operation since 2005 and was designed to provide high quality optical spectroscopy over a wide range of wavelengths with minimal overheads.   The WiFeS instrument consists of two cameras that are mounted on a common baseplate which sits inside a vacuum chamber attached to the Cassegrain focus of the ANU 2.3m telescope.    Each camera contains a lenslet array that produces a set of images across its focal plane.  These images can be combined into a single data cube using software developed by Dopita et al. (2007).    This data cube provides information about both spatial position and wavelength along each line-of-sight through the object being observed.  In addition to this capability, WiFeS also offers several other advantages including:  - High throughput due to the use of dichroic beam splitters and fibre optic coupling between the lenses and detectors.  - Flexible observing modes ranging from fully automated observations to manual control via remote desktop interface.  - Fast readout times allowing multiple targets to be observed simultaneously or rapid cycling between different targets during a night's observation run.  - Low maintenance requirements as it does not require any moving parts within the vacuum enclosure.  - Excellent stability thanks to the design of the optics bench and the thermal isolation provided by the vacuum enclosure.  - Large format detector arrays providing excellent signal-to-noise ratio even under poor seeing conditions.  - Robust mechanical design ensuring long-term reliability..."}
{"text":"We report on the discovery and study of J1128+592, an intraday variable (IDV) radio quasar at redshift z = 1.8. The object was found in our search for new IDVs using data obtained with the Very Large Array (VLA). We have monitored this source over two epochs separated by one year to look for variability on timescales ranging between 10 minutes and several days. Our results show that it is a strong IDV source which varies up to 50% peak-to-peak amplitude on time scales as short as 20 min. This makes J1128+592 one of the most rapidly varying quasars known so far. In addition we find evidence for long-term variations on timescales longer than 100 days. These are likely due to interstellar scintillation caused by density fluctuations along the line-of-sight towards the source. Finally, we present optical spectroscopy taken with the Keck telescope showing broad emission lines typical of quasars."}
{"text":"We present the results of an analysis of the supersymmetric standard model with minimal supergravity boundary conditions at the grand unification scale, including all one-loop corrections to gauge and Yukawa couplings as well as two-loop contributions to the running of the soft supersymmetry breaking parameters.  We find that this scenario is compatible with current experimental bounds on sparticle masses if tan beta is large (tan beta > 50) or small (tan beta < 10). In addition we show how the lightest Higgs boson mass can be predicted within this framework for any value of tan beta between 1 and 60. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results for future searches for supersymmetry at colliders such as LHC. The supersymmetric standard model has been studied extensively over many years [1] . It provides a natural solution to the hierarchy problem by introducing new particles which cancel quadratic divergences associated with radiative corrections to the scalar potential [2] , while also providing a candidate particle for dark matter [3] .\nIn recent years there have been several studies [4] - [8] investigating whether it is possible to construct models where the electroweak symmetry breaking sector is described by the MSSM [9] but the underlying physics is governed by some more fundamental theory valid at higher energies. This approach is motivated by the fact that the MSSM suffers from fine-tuning problems [10] due to its sensitivity to unknown high-scale physics [11] . If these problems are solved then the MSSM may provide a good description of nature up to very high scales [12] . One possibility would be to embed the MSSM into a Grand Unified Theory [13] based upon SO(10), although other possibilities exist [14] . Another possibility is to consider theories with extra dimensions [15] - [17] ."}

In one regime we find that the temperature profile has a power-law form T \u221d r^{-(3\/2)}, while in another it follows a more complicated dependence on radius. The latter case occurs when the luminosity is dominated either by viscous dissipation or by advection. For both cases, however, the radial velocity profiles have similar shapes.

{"text":"We study theoretically the crossover between impurity and valence band states for diluted magnetic semiconductors (DMS). We show that this crossover is determined by the competition between the exchange interaction with conduction electrons, which favors impurity-like behavior at low carrier concentration, and the Coulomb attraction by acceptor ions, which leads to formation of bound hole pairs around each ion and thus promotes valence-band like behavior.  In particular we find that the crossover occurs when the density of holes becomes comparable to the density of acceptor ions. This result explains why the crossover has been observed only recently in experiments on GaAs-based DMSs but not earlier in Si-based ones where the density of acceptor atoms was much higher than the density of doped carriers. Our results also explain recent experimental observations of an unusual temperature dependence of the magnetization near the crossover point. Finally our theory predicts that the crossover should be observable even if there are no free carriers present in the system due to compensation effects."}
{"text":"We present the results of three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of accretion disks around black holes, which include both gas pressure and radiation pressure as well as self-gravity. We find that the surface density distribution is not smooth but shows spiral arms at radii where the disk becomes optically thick to its own emission. The spiral structure arises because of gravitational instability caused by the rapid increase of the Toomre Q parameter when the disk becomes optically thin. In addition we show that the radial velocity dispersion increases rapidly near the inner edge of the annulus due to shocks produced there. This may be responsible for producing broad line profiles observed in some AGNs. \n \n Keywords: Black hole -accretion disk systems; Hydrodynamics; Self-gravitation; Shock waves; Gravitational instabilities; Opacity effects \n \n \n \n 1 Introduction \n \n It has been suggested that many active galactic nuclei (AGN) are powered by supermassive black holes (SMBHs). A SMBH can grow through mass accretion onto it via an accretion disk surrounding the central object. Since the discovery of quasars more than 30 years ago, observations have shown that most AGNs exhibit double-humped broad-line profiles in their optical spectra (e.g., [1; 2]), indicating that they contain rotating accretion disks [3] . However, theoretical models predict that such disks should become unstable if they rotate too fast [4] , so how do these objects maintain stability? One possible explanation is that the disks are supported against gravity by magnetic fields [5] or relativistic jets [6] .\n \nIn this Letter, we study the properties of accretion disks using three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations including both gas pressure and radiation pressures as well as self-gravity [7\u20139] .

{"text":"We study the problem of finding minimum cost arborescences in directed graphs with edge costs that are functions of their distances, where each vertex has an associated demand for bandwidth. We show how to solve this problem by reducing it to the well-studied problem of computing shortest paths on weighted digraphs (WDP). Our reduction is based on the concept of directed star arboricity which we define as follows. Let G = (V , E) be any directed graph. A set S \u2286 V is called a star if there exists exactly one vertex u \u2208 S such that all other vertices v \u2208 S have only edges into u. The directed star arboricity of G is defined as the smallest number k such that every subgraph H of G can be decomposed into at most k stars.

{"text":"The curvature of space-time is one of the most important quantities in general relativity, and it has been studied extensively for many years.  In this work we present new bounds on the curvature of the universe that are derived by using only information about its large-scale structure.   We show how these bounds can be used to constrain cosmological models with nontrivial geometries such as those containing extra dimensions or time-varying fundamental constants.    The results presented here have implications not just for theoretical physics but also for observational astronomy and cosmology. General relativity (GR) describes gravity at all scales ranging from microscopic black holes to supermassive galaxies. It predicts that matter curves spacetime around itself, which causes light rays emitted from distant sources to bend towards each other. This effect was first observed over 100 years ago when astronomers noticed that the positions of stars near the edge of our galaxy were systematically shifted away from their expected locations based on Newton's theory of gravitation [1] . Since then, gravitational lensing has become an extremely powerful tool for studying dark matter [2] , testing GR [3] , constraining modified theories of gravity [4] , and measuring distances [5] .\nIn addition to predicting the bending of light, GR also makes precise predictions about the geometry of spacetime [6] . For example, if you travel along a straight line through empty space, your path will remain straight even though there may be massive objects nearby [7, 8] . Similarly, if you look out into space far enough so that no matter exists, you should see nothing but flat, featureless space [9] . These predictions depend crucially on the fact that the metric describing the geometry of spacetime must satisfy Einstein's field equations [10] . However, despite decades of research, it remains unclear whether the universe actually obeys these equations [11] ."}

In particular, we discuss how DFT can be used as a tool to study ground-state properties of molecules by means of Kohn-Sham orbitals. We also present some fundamental results concerning the convergence of iterative schemes that are commonly employed within self-consistent field approaches. The second chapter deals with the description of several classes of algorithms based on direct minimization techniques which have been developed over the last decades to solve the Hartree-Fock equations numerically.

{"text":"We study stability properties of the periodic Toda lattice with respect to small  time-periodic perturbations. We show that if the perturbation is sufficiently small, then there exists an exponentially stable solution which can be found by solving a linear algebraic system. The proof relies on the Floquet theory and Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction method. This result generalizes previous results obtained in the case when the unperturbed system has only one equilibrium point or when it possesses two equilibria but they are not connected via heteroclinic orbits. In particular we prove that for any number of equilibria greater than 2 (including infinitely many) there exist arbitrarily large perturbations such that all solutions of perturbed systems converge to infinity as t \u2192 \u221e. \nIntroduction\n\nThe Toda lattice is a classical example of a completely integrable Hamiltonian system introduced by Toda [Tod] . It describes N particles moving along straight lines with pairwise exponential interaction potential between them. For simplicity let us consider the case N = 1. Then the equation describing this motion takes the form \nwhere x(t), y(t) \u2208 R n , A : [0, T ] \u00d7 R n \u2192 R n\u00d7n is continuous matrix-valued function satisfying some additional conditions specified below. If A \u2261 0, i.e., no external forces act upon the particle, then the corresponding solution is called the free Toda flow. It was shown in [KN] that the free Toda flow is globally asymptotically stable provided that the spectrum of the matrix A does not intersect the imaginary axis. Moreover, the authors proved that the set of initial data leading to bounded trajectories coincides with the set of initial data belonging to the basin of attraction of the zero solution. However, these results do not hold true anymore if the matrix A depends on time."}
{"text":"We present the first global, three-dimensional (3D) numerical simulations of magnetorotational instability (MRI), which is believed to be responsible for angular momentum transport and accretion in astrophysical disks.

This scaling law agrees well with previous theoretical predictions based on dimensional analysis and phenomenological arguments. The radial profile of the turbulent viscosity follows an approximate power-law distribution $\\eta(r) \\sim r^{-1\/2}$ over several orders of magnitude in radius.

These results provide important insights into the physics of MRI-driven turbulence and may help us understand how matter is transported across different spatial scales in real systems."}

This article describes how this collaboration worked by examining one such project - the Network of Excellence in Wireless Communications (NEWCOM#).  NEWCOM# brought together more than 100 academic and industrial organisations from all over Europe into an integrated research consortium that developed new technologies for wireless communications systems.

{"text":"We present new simulations that show how condensed gas is formed by ongoing accretion onto galactic halos, which are heated to temperatures above 10 million degrees Kelvin (MK).

Our models predict that condensed gas should be found at distances between 100 kpc and 1 Mpc from galaxies within massive clusters. This prediction agrees well with recent X-ray observations of cool clouds in Abell 1795 and Abell 2163. These clouds have masses ranging from $10^{9}$ to $10^{11}$ solar masses, sizes less than 50 kiloparsecs, and densities greater than 1000 atoms per cubic centimeter.

The majority of these objects show no evidence for rotation; however, we do detect significant polarization vectors aligned perpendicular to the major axes of several sources which may be due to magnetic fields. These observations suggest that many of the clouds were formed by large-scale gravitational collapse rather than rotational support. This work is supported by NASA grant NNX10AC99G. We report on the results of an investigation of the shapes and orientations of dense molecular gas clumps within the Orion Nebula region. Using near-infrared polarimetric imaging data taken at Gemini Observatory's North Telescope, we identify 80 percent of our sample as oblate spheroids. Twenty percent exhibit more complicated morphologies such as prolate spheroids or bipolar structures. Most of these objects appear to lack any internal rotation but some display polarization vectors oriented perpendicularly to their major axes suggesting the presence of magnetic fields."}
{"text":"We discuss the gauge invariance properties of effective actions obtained by integrating out heavy degrees of freedom, such as quarks and gluons, within supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories. We show that these actions are not generally invariant under local gauge transformations unless certain conditions on their form are satisfied. These results have important consequences for the construction of gauge-invariant observables in supersymmetric gauge theories. They also provide an explanation why it is possible to construct nontrivial superpotentials even though supersymmetry does not allow any explicit breaking terms at tree level. Finally we argue that our findings can be used to resolve some puzzling features observed recently in lattice simulations of N = 1 supersymmetric QCD with four flavors. Supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories play an important role both in particle physics and string theory. Their low-energy dynamics is described by an effective action which contains all quantum corrections due to the integration over heavy fields like quarks or gluons. This effective action has been studied extensively during recent years but many questions remain open concerning its precise structure. One particular issue concerns the question whether this action is gauge invariant. It was shown already more than twenty years ago [1] that if one integrates out only massive fermions then the resulting effective action is indeed gauge invariant. However, when including also massive bosonic degrees of freedom there exist counterexamples where the effective action fails to be gauge invariant [2] . Recently, this problem attracted renewed interest because of its relevance for the understanding of non-perturbative phenomena in supersymmetric gauge theories [3, 4] .\nIn this work we study the gauge invariance properties systematically using functional methods. Our main result is that the effective action is always gauge invariant up to total derivatives provided two conditions are met. First, the effective action must contain no higher-order time-derivatives acting on the gauge field. Second, the coefficients appearing in front of the various operators in the effective action should satisfy certain relations. For example, they cannot depend explicitly on the gauge coupling constant g. If either condition is violated then the effective action will fail to be gauge"}
{"text":"We study the dynamics of two interacting bosonic species confined to an optical lattice, with one species being initially prepared as a coherent state at each site while the other is initially prepared as a thermal cloud. We show that this system supports both symmetric and asymmetric soliton solutions which are stable against small perturbations for certain values of the chemical potentials. The stability properties of these solitons can be understood by studying their linearization spectrum around the stationary states. In particular we find that the presence of a finite temperature leads to additional unstable modes associated with phonon-like excitations. Finally, we demonstrate how our results may be used to describe experiments on spinor condensates loaded into optical lattices. Introduction:-Recent experimental advances have made it possible to create quantum degenerate gases consisting of several different atomic species [1] . These systems provide new opportunities to explore novel phenomena such as supersolids [2] , phase separation [3] or spin-orbit coupling [4] .\nIn this work we consider a particularly interesting example where there exist two distinct types of particles (e.g., atoms) which interact via s-wave scattering but differ in mass and\/or internal structure [5] . This situation arises naturally when considering mixtures of hyperfine states [6] or isotopes [7, 8] within the same atom type [9] . For instance, recent experiments involving 87 Rb and 41 K [10] have demonstrated the formation of a mixture of two different hyperfine states after evaporative cooling [11] . Another possibility would involve using 40 K and 6 Li [12] . Here, the lighter species could be considered as impurities immersed in a background gas of heavier fermions [13] . Alternatively, if the masses were reversed then the heavy species could act as impurities [14] ."}

We find that SNe Ia are systematically bluer than expected if they were standard candles, but this effect is consistent with being due to dust extinction by interstellar material along their line-of-sight. In addition we find evidence for an additional component of dust extinction which increases rapidly towards higher redshift. This extra extinction may be associated with the intergalactic medium surrounding galaxy clusters, or it could arise within individual galaxies as a result of recent star formation activity.

Using this sample we find that the amplitude of the streaming field decreases rapidly towards lower redshift, consistent with theoretical predictions for the growth rate of large-scale structure.

{"text":"We show that any entangled state can be transformed into another by means of local quantum operations and classical communication (LOCC). We also prove the converse, i.e., if two states are related by LOCC then they must necessarily be entangled with each other. This result is obtained in terms of an equivalence relation on bipartite density matrices which we call LOCC-equivalence. The proof uses only elementary linear algebra and convexity arguments. It does not require any knowledge about operator algebras or functional analysis. In particular it avoids the use of von Neumann entropy as well as the concept of majorization. \nThe results presented here have been announced recently in Ref. [1] . \nI. INTRODUCTORY REMARK\nIn this note we present some new results concerning the transformation of entangled states under local quantum operations and classical communications (LOCC) [2] .\nII.

{"text":"We present an algorithm that efficiently creates and propagates order in spin chains with the help of geodesic paths on graphs representing the spins. The algorithm is based on the observation that, if we consider two neighboring sites as nodes of a graph, then the probability distribution over all possible states of these two sites can be represented by a weighted edge between them. We show how to use this representation to create ordered regions within the chain using only local information about the state of each site. In particular, our method allows us to find optimal configurations of the system at low temperatures (where thermal fluctuations are small) without having to explore the entire configuration space. This makes it possible to study systems whose size would otherwise make exact calculations intractable. Our results demonstrate that the proposed approach provides accurate predictions even when applied to relatively short chains. Finally, we discuss several extensions of the presented ideas which may lead to further improvements in efficiency. \n \n Introduction \n \n Many physical phenomena such as magnetism or phase transitions occur due to cooperative behavior among many interacting particles. For example, magnetic ordering in solids occurs because individual atoms interact strongly via their magnetic moments. Similarly, liquid helium undergoes superfluidity below its critical temperature T_c = 2.17 K because pairs of helium-4 atoms form tightly bound bosons known as Cooper pairs. These examples illustrate that understanding collective behavior requires studying large ensembles of interacting particles rather than single isolated ones. However, simulating macroscopic properties of complex systems composed of many interacting elements remains one of the most challenging problems in computational physics today. Indeed, while microscopic interactions between individual particles can often be described accurately by quantum mechanics, describing macroscopic properties of large collections of particles typically involves approximations that cannot capture subtle effects arising from correlations between different parts of the system. As a result, numerical simulations of large-scale models of real-world systems are usually performed using approximate methods such as Monte Carlo sampling [1] . Unfortunately, these approaches become computationally expensive when used to simulate systems containing millions..."}
{"text":"We present the first explicit construction of supersymmetric quantum solitons in any dimension and for an arbitrary number of colors N . The solutions are obtained by solving a set of coupled nonlinear partial differential equations, which we solve numerically using a relaxation method. We find that there is always at least one solution with zero energy density (the vacuum). For large values of N , we also find solutions with nontrivial energy densities. These results provide further evidence that the theory has a rich spectrum of excitations. Supersymmetry plays a crucial role in our analysis; it allows us to reduce the problem to finding solutions of ordinary differential equations instead of partial differential equations. \nIntroduction: In this work, we study the dynamics of a class of field theories known as supersymmetric gauge theories. Such theories have been studied extensively over the past few years because they play important roles in many areas of physics including string theory [1] .\nThe simplest example of such a theory is the so-called \\N = 1 super-Yang-Mills theory\" [2] . This theory describes particles called gluons interacting via a force mediated by other particles called quarks. It can be viewed as a generalization of Maxwell's electrodynamics where the electric charge e is replaced by a new parameter g. The coupling constant g determines how strongly the fields interact with each other. If g is small then the interactions between the fields will be weak while if g is large then these interactions become strong."}

{"text":"We study how shortrange attractive interactions affect the structure, dynamics, and rheology of simple fluids by means of molecular simulations. We consider two different models for the pair potential between particles in which we vary the range of attraction while keeping its strength fixed. In both cases, we find that increasing the range of attraction leads to an increase in the static structure factor at low wavevectors (q), indicating more pronounced correlations among neighboring particles. The dynamic properties are also affected as evidenced by the fact that the self diffusion coefficient decreases with increasing range of attraction. Finally, we show that the shear viscosity increases monotonically with decreasing range of attraction. These results suggest that tuning the range of attraction can be used to control the microstructure and macroscopic behavior of simple liquids. DOI: 10.1063\/1.5018481\nI. INTRODUCTORY REMARkS\nThe ability to tune the physical properties of materials is crucial for many applications ranging from medicine [1] , energy storage [2] , catalysis [3] , and lubrication [4] . One way to achieve this goal is through the use of external fields such as electric or magnetic fields [5] . However, these approaches often require large amounts of power [6] and\/or sophisticated experimental setups [7, 8] .\nAn alternative approach consists on using chemical modifications [9] or nanoparticles [10] to change the surface chemistry of existing materials [11] . This strategy has been successfully employed to modify the wettability [12] , optical [13] , electrical [14] , mechanical [15] , thermal [16] , and catalytic [17] properties of surfaces [18] . A similar idea could potentially be applied to bulk systems where one would like to manipulate their physical properties without changing their composition [19] . For example, it may be possible to create new types of glassy [20] or liquid [21] matter by varying the range of intermolecular forces [22] . Indeed, recent experiments have shown that the addition of small concentrations of surfactants [23] or polymers [24] can significantly alter the phase diagram [25] and transport [26] properties of simple liquids [27] ."}

{"text":"We report on the non-saturating magnetoresistance (NSMR) effect observed for thin films with an inhomogeneous distribution of charge carriers, which is caused by their trapping at defects or impurities. We show that this NSMR can be explained within the framework of the semiclassical Boltzmann transport theory if one takes into account the spatial dependence of the scattering time. The latter was calculated using Monte Carlo simulations based on the solution of the kinetic equation for electrons interacting with phonons and static disorder potential fluctuations. Our results are compared to experimental data obtained for InAs\/GaSb superlattices grown by molecular beam epitaxy. Non-saturating magnetoresistivity has been recently discovered in various materials including semiconductors [1] , metals [2] , carbon nanotubes [3] . This phenomenon manifests itself as a linear increase of resistivity \u03c1(H) \u221d H when magnetic field H increases up to several Tesla. It is believed that it originates from the presence of spatially localized states near the Fermi level [4] .\nIn this work we study the non-saturating magnetotransport properties of semiconductor heterostructures consisting of alternating layers of GaSb\/InAs. These structures were grown by molecular beam epi-taxy [5] . They have a high density of structural imperfections such as dislocations [6] and stacking faults [7] .

{"text":"We study the cosmological evolution of modified-gravity theories with an action that contains higher-order curvature terms (f(R)) by using a combination of analytical techniques and numerical simulations. We show how to obtain exact solutions for the background expansion history of these models at early times when the universe is dominated by radiation or matter; we also derive approximate analytic expressions valid on all scales during the late-time accelerated phase driven by dark energy. In particular, we find that there are two classes of viable f(R) models which can reproduce the observed cosmic acceleration without introducing any new degrees of freedom beyond those present in general relativity. The first class includes models where the effective gravitational constant decreases as time goes on; this leads to a phantom-like behavior characterized by w < \u22121. The second class consists of models where the effective gravitational coupling increases with time; here one finds quintessence-like behaviors with w > \u22121.

The light curves show deep primary minima which we interpret as being caused by total eclipses of the accretion disks around the white dwarfs.

We find that the number of GP candidates increases as we lower the frequency below 150 MHz.

{"text":"We present the results of our numerical simulations of magnetized accretion disks in which we solve the mean-field magnetohydrodynamic equations for an axisymmetric disk with a prescribed radial distribution of angular momentum and mass fluxes, using the shearing-box approximation.  We find that the magnetic field is amplified by differential rotation to produce large-scale poloidal fields whose strength increases outward as $(r^{-3\/2})$ (where $r$ is the radius). The toroidal component of the magnetic field also grows rapidly due to winding up of the poloidal field lines by shear flows. As a result, the plasma beta parameter decreases inwardly toward the central object. In addition, we find that the Maxwell stress associated with the magnetic field causes significant redistribution of angular momentum within the disk. This leads to enhanced transport of angular momentum outwards across the disk surface compared to viscous stresses alone."}

In particular we focus on two different approaches which are based either on Gibbs sampling or Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Finally we describe some applications of these methods to simulated data sets. This research was supported by NSF grant AST-0707763. Cosmology has been revolutionized over the past decade by precision measurements of the cosmic microwave background anisotropies made by WMAP [1] , PLANCK [2] and other experiments [3] .

One such question concerns the nature of dark matter [7, 8] : what is its particle content? What is its mass? How does it interact with ordinary matter?\nAnswering these questions requires detailed knowledge of the spatial distribution of dark matter throughout space and time [9] . Unfortunately direct detection experiments [10] cannot provide this information because they only measure the gravitational effects of dark matter particles [11] .

We also present simulation results showing performance comparisons between our proposed method and conventional single-carrier systems.

{"text":"We present new observational constraints on the cosmic ray (CR) energy density and its evolution with redshift, based on gamma-ray observations by Fermi\/LAT in the range 0 < z < 1.5. We find that CRs contribute at most 10% to the total pressure budget of the universe at redshifts below 2. This upper limit is consistent with theoretical expectations for the contribution of CRs accelerated by supernovae. The results are also compatible with previous measurements using radio data. These limits can be used as priors when modeling the effects of CRs on cosmological observables such as galaxy clustering or weak lensing. Cosmic rays (CRs), charged particles which fill space uniformly over large volumes, have been observed throughout our Galaxy and beyond. They play an important role in many astrophysical phenomena including galactic winds, star formation, and possibly even the acceleration of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays [1] . However, their origin remains unknown [2] .\nIn this work we use gamma-ray observations made by the Large Area Telescope (LAT) aboard the Fermi satellite [3] , to place tight constraints on the amount of CRs contributing to the overall pressure budget of the Universe [4] . In particular, we consider two different models for the CR distribution function f(p,z). First, we assume that it follows a power law spectrum dN\/dE ~ E^{-alpha} between energies Emin = 10 GeV and Emax = 100 TeV; secondly, we adopt a broken power-law model where the spectral index changes from alpha1 = -2.2 to alpha2 = -3 above some break energy Eb = 50 GeV. For both cases, we fix the normalization factor A by requiring that the integral of f(p,z) over all momenta equals unity. \nThe resulting CR distributions are shown in Figure 1 . \nTo calculate the effect of these CR populations on the expansion history of the universe, we solve numerically the coupled system of equations describing the time-evolution of the background..."}

These instabilities have growth rates comparable to those found previously by other authors but occur at much lower values of the magnetic field strength than predicted by previous work. The instability is driven primarily by the pressure gradient term in the momentum equation rather than the Lorentz force or gravitational terms as has been suggested before.

{"text":"We study the nonlinear evolution of the magnetorotational instability (MRI) in accretion disks, taking into account the vertical dependence of the angular velocity $\\Omega(z)$. We find that MRI can generate magnetic helicity efficiently even when there is no net poloidal field initially present. The generated magnetic helicity leads to an increase of the toroidal component of the magnetic field through the inverse cascade process. This results in the formation of large-scale helical structures which are similar to those observed in numerical simulations of MRI-driven turbulence. In addition, we show that the presence of differential rotation causes the growth rate of MRI to be larger than that obtained for Keplerian rotation at all wavenumbers. As a result, MRI grows faster and generates more magnetic energy compared to previous studies where only Keplerian rotation was considered. Finally, we discuss how our results may affect the alpha effect in accretion disks."}

To evaluate the effectiveness of our model, we conducted experiments with two different OODB systems, O2 and ObjectStore. Our experimental results show that our model provides accurate estimations of the response times of both OODB systems under various workloads.

However, since they support complex data structures and operations, their performances may vary widely depending upon several factors [2] .\nIn order to develop high-performance OODBSs, it is necessary to analyze how these factors influence their performances. Therefore, researchers have studied the performance evaluations of OODBSs extensively [3] ,[4],[5],[6],[7],[8],[9],[lo],[11],[12],[13],[14],[15],[16], [17] ,[18],[19], [20] ,[21], [22] ,[23], [24] ,[25], [26] ,[27], [28] ,[29], [30] ,[31], [32] ,[33], [34] ,[35], [36] , [37J, [38] , [39J, [40] , [411, [42] , [43J, [44] , [45J, [46] , [47J, [48] , [49J, [50] , [51J, [52J, [53J, [54J, [55J, [56J,"}
{"text":"The origin of the magnetoelectric effect (ME) is investigated by first-principles calculations for bulk and surface structures of BiFeO$_{3}$, which has been recently discovered to be ferroelectric with antiferromagnetic ordering at room temperature.  The calculated results show that the ME coupling constant is strongly dependent on the oxygen octahedral tilt angle $\\theta_{oct}$; it increases rapidly as $\\theta_{oct}$ decreases below $11^{\\circ} \\sim 13^{\\circ}$. This result suggests that the large ME response observed experimentally can be attributed mainly to the rotation of oxygen octahedra around the c-axis. In addition, we find that the contribution from the Fe magnetic moment plays an important role in enhancing the ME effect when $\\theta_{oct}$ becomes small enough. Finally, we discuss possible origins of the discrepancy between our theoretical prediction and experimental observation. We also present some suggestions for further experiments."}

{"text":"We present the results on systematic uncertainties in determination of hadronic parameters using QCD Sum Rules (QSR). We consider two types of uncertainties: theoretical and experimental ones. Theoretical uncertainty is estimated by varying renormalization scale, Borel mass parameter and threshold value used to separate ground state contribution from excited states one. Experimental error comes mainly from errors in input values for quark masses and decay constants. In addition we take into account also dependence of final result on choice of interpolating current. For each type of uncertainty we calculate its effect separately as well as total uncertainty which includes all sources mentioned above. Finally we compare our results with those presented recently in literature. \n \n Keywords: Systematics, Uncertainty, Hadronic Parameters, QCD Sum Rules, Quark Masses, Decay Constants. 1 Introduction \n \n In this work we study systematic uncertainties in determination of various hadronic parameters like masses, decay constants etc., using QCD Sum Rules [1] . This method allows us to obtain information about properties of low-lying resonances starting from first principles - Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) [2] , without any additional assumptions or models. It has been successfully applied to many different processes involving light quarks such as: pion form factor [3] , nucleon electromagnetic [4] and axial [5] form factors [6] , semileptonic decays [7, 8] , heavy-light mesons [9] , charmonium [10] and bottomonium [11] systems [12] .\n \nThe main idea behind QCD Sum Rules is that correlation function constructed out of currents corresponding to particular quantum numbers can be represented as dispersion relation over physical spectrum of particles contributing to it. Then, after applying double Borel transformation [13] , i.e. transforming both variables p^2 and q^2 simultaneously [14] , where p is momentum flowing through initial state and q is momentum transferred between initial and final states, one obtains so-called phenomenological representation [15] :"}
{"text":"We present new observations of the dense core L1544, which show that its central region is characterized by an abrupt decrease in the gas kinetic temperature and density at about 0.1 pc (1000 AU) radius. The observed properties are consistent with those expected for a gravitationally unstable Bonnor-Ebert sphere undergoing rapid gravitational collapse to form protostellar cores. We also find evidence for infall motions toward the center of the cloud on scales as large as 1 pc. These results suggest that this object may be one of the best candidates yet found for studying the initial conditions leading up to star formation. \n \n Keywords: Infrared dark clouds, Protostars, Gravitational instability, Infall motion \n \n Dense molecular clouds such as Taurus Molecular Cloud-1 contain many prestellar cores whose masses range between  #10$^{\u22122} M_{\\odot}$ and 10 $M_{\\odot}$ . Observations have shown that these objects are often surrounded by extended envelopes of cold dusty material that can extend out to several parsecs or more. It has been suggested that some of these cores will undergo rapid gravitational collapse into protostellar systems within their lifetimes. However, it remains unclear how much time elapses before the onset of collapse since there are no clear observational signatures marking the transition from a quiescent state to active accretion onto a forming protostar. One possible way to study this process would be to observe the evolution of the physical structure of collapsing cores over time using millimeter-wave interferometers operating at wavelengths longer than 3 mm. Unfortunately, most current facilities lack sufficient angular resolution and\/or sensitivity to detect the small-scale structures associated with individual protostellar cores embedded deep inside dense molecular clouds."}
{"text":"We study the formation of binary systems in which one component is a massive planet and the other is a small body, such as an ice giant or dwarf planet. We find that these objects can be captured into stable orbits by chaotic scattering with Neptune's moon Triton. The resulting orbital parameters are consistent with those inferred for Pluto-Charon and Eris-Dysnomia. This mechanism may also explain how some Kuiper belt objects were captured to form the scattered disk population. \n \n Keywords: Planetary systems; Chaos; Capture; Scattering \n \n 1 Introduction \n \n Binaries consisting of two large bodies have been found throughout our Solar System (e.g., [1]). In particular, there exist several examples where one member of the pair is a massive planet while the other is either another planet [2] or a smaller object like an ice giant [3] . These binaries are thought to have formed via gravitational interactions between their components [4] , but it remains unclear what physical processes led to this outcome. Here we propose a new scenario for the production of such binaries: they could result from chaotic scattering events involving Neptune\u2019s moon Triton. Our results suggest that this process might account for at least some observed binaries. \n \n 2 Model Description \n \n To investigate whether Triton-induced chaos could lead to the formation of planetary binaries, we performed numerical simulations using the Mercury N-body integrator [5] . For each simulation, we started with three planets on circular orbits around the Sun: Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus. Then, we added Neptune and its moon Triton onto the same orbit, assuming that all four bodies had equal masses [6] . Finally, we introduced a fifth massless particle representing a hypothetical planetesimal located near Neptune\u2019s 3:2 mean-motion resonance [7 ] . As shown below, this location corresponds roughly to the region where most of the simulated captures occur."}
{"text":"We present the results on galaxy pairs in the AMIGA sample, which is an optically selected sample of isolated galaxies with distances up to 100 Mpc (cz < 10000 km\/s). The main goal was to study how close companions affect the evolution and properties of their host galaxies. We have found that about half of all isolated galaxies are surrounded by at least one companion within a projected distance of 1 h-1 Mpc or less. This fraction increases for smaller separations between the two galaxies. About 20% of our objects show signs of interaction such as tidal tails and\/or bridges. These fractions depend only weakly on morphological type but strongly on luminosity class. In addition we find that the majority of interacting systems are dominated by early-type spirals.

{"text":"We report on the detection of an oscillatory pattern with periods between 5 and 20 minutes, which is observed to be associated with sunspots' penumbrae. The oscillations are detected by applying wavelet analysis to time series obtained from high-resolution observations made at the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope (SST). We find that these oscillations have amplitudes up to 0.5 km\/sec and occur preferentially along the edges of penumbral filaments. They appear to be confined within a narrow range of heliocentric angles, centered around 30 degrees. These results suggest that they may represent modified acoustic waves trapped inside magnetic flux tubes. This work was supported by NASA grants NAG5-7067 and NNG04GK85G. Sunspot penumbrae exhibit a variety of phenomena including rapid flows, brightenings, and darkening events known as Evershed flow, umbral flashes, and moat flows respectively.

{"text":"We show that the conserved charges associated with asymptotically flat or anti-de Sitter spaces are always integer multiples of some fundamental charge, which is determined by the asymptotic behavior of the metric at spatial infinity. This result holds for any number of dimensions greater than one. We also discuss how this property can be used to define an entropy function for black holes. The results presented here were obtained during my stay as a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard University under the supervision of Professors J. Maldacena and A. Strominger. I would like to thank them both very much for their support and encouragement throughout this work. \n \n In recent years there has been considerable interest in understanding the statistical mechanics of quantum gravity using holographic techniques [1] . One of the most important insights into these questions was provided by Witten [2] , who showed that the partition functions of certain gravitational theories could be computed exactly via supersymmetric gauge theory methods. More recently, it has become clear that many aspects of the thermodynamics of black holes may be understood in terms of the properties of dual conformal field theories [3] .\n \nIn particular, the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy [4] of a black hole is given by the logarithm of its degeneracy [5] :"}
{"text":"We present an algorithm for sampling from the posterior distribution over latent variables in graphical models, which we call BankSampler. The key idea is to use a bank of samples as a set of ``clues'' that guide our exploration of the space of possible solutions. We show how this can be used with Gibbs and Metropolis-Hastings algorithms to sample efficiently from high-dimensional distributions. Our experiments demonstrate significant speedups on several challenging problems including topic modeling, collaborative filtering, and image segmentation. Graphical models are widely used to represent complex probability distributions by factorizing them into simpler components. In many cases these factors correspond to intuitive concepts such as topics or features; however, it may not always be clear what they mean. For example, consider the following model:\n$$P(w_1,\\ldots,w_n)=P(w_1|z_1)\\times\\cdots\\times P(w_n|z_n),$$ where $z_i$ denotes some hidden variable associated with word $w_i$ (e.g., its topic). This model has no obvious interpretation because there is no direct relationship between the hidden variables and the observed data. However, if we assume that each $z_i$ takes values in $\\{0,1\\}$ then we obtain the following: $$P(w_1, \\ldots, w_n) = \\sum_{a=1}^{k} \\prod_{i=1}^n P(w_i=a|z_i=1)\\prod_{i\\neq j} P(z_j=0|z_i=0)$$ Here, $k$ is the number of different values that each $z_i$ can take. If we further assume that $P(w_i=a| z_i=1)$ is uniform across all $a$'s, then we recover the multinomial naive Bayes classifier."}

{"text":"We report on the observation of electron doping in cuprate superconductors by interfacing them to manganite insulators through epitaxial growth and chemical bonding at interfaces.  The interface between La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 (LSMO) and YBa2Cu3O6+x (YBCO), which are both parent compounds for high temperature superconductivity, is found to be highly conducting despite the large lattice mismatch between LSMO and YBCO. This suggests that charge transfer across the interface occurs due to strong electronic hybridization rather than strain relaxation alone. We also find that the hole concentration in the YBCO layer can be controlled by varying the thickness of the LSMO layer grown on top of it. These results demonstrate an alternative approach towards engineering the carrier density in cuprate superconductors using oxide heterostructures. High-temperature superconductivity has been observed only in materials containing copper-oxygen planes known as CuO2 layers [1] . In these systems, holes doped into the CuO2 plane give rise to Cooper pairs leading to superfluidity [2] . However, the maximum critical temperature Tc = 92 K achieved so far in this class of materials is still well below the theoretical limit predicted by Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory [3] , raising questions about how to further enhance Tc [4] .\nIn recent years there have been significant efforts made to explore new routes toward enhancing Tc beyond its current record value [5] . One promising route involves introducing electrons into the CuO2 plane [6] . For example, replacing oxygen atoms in the CuO2 plane with fluorine leads to a reduction in the number of holes in the system [7, 8] . Alternatively, one may introduce electrons directly into the CuO2 plane by growing thin films of transition metal oxides such as SrTiO3 [9] or LaAlO3 [10] onto the surface of cuprate superconductors. While these approaches show promise, they require precise control over film composition and structure during deposition [11] . An alternative strategy would involve controlling the carrier density in cuprates without changing their crystal structures [12] ."}

It plays an important role in studying soil properties [2] , analyzing crop growth [3] , and optimizing fertilizer management [4] . Currently, there are many techniques available for measuring soil bulk density [5] - [8] . Among them, the gamma-ray attenuation technique [9] is widely applied because it is non-destructive and easy-to-use [10] . However, due to its low spatial resolution [11] , the gamma-ray attenuation method cannot accurately determine the distribution of soil bulk density [12] . To overcome these shortcomings, some researchers have developed other technologies including electrical resistivity tomography [13] , ground penetrating radar [14] , neutron radiography [15] , and X-ray computed tomography [16] . These technologies provide higher spatial resolutions than the gamma-ray attenuation approach [17] but they require expensive equipment or complicated procedures [18] . \n \n Recently, vibration-induced conductivity fluctuation(VICF), also known as electromechanical impedance spectroscopy [19] , has been introduced to detect changes in soil moisture [20] , soil salinity [21] , and soil texture [22] .

The author suggests that it may be useful for teachers to use similar approaches when teaching other subjects such as mathematics or chemistry. The author also discusses some of the difficulties associated with using this method. This article appeared originally in Physics Today (Vol. 51 No. 1 January 1997). It can be downloaded from: http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/physics\/9701001v1.pdf  In order to teach physics effectively, one must first have a clear understanding of what constitutes good thinking within the subject area. Unfortunately, many people who are not trained scientists do not think like physicists; they tend to make mistakes which often lead them astray. For example, if asked whether two objects will fall together towards earth's center of mass, most people would say no because they believe that gravity acts only between bodies that touch each other. However, according to Newtonian mechanics, gravitational attraction does act upon all matter regardless of its position relative to another body. If you were to ask someone else why two objects don't fall together, she might answer that they are connected by a string so their weight cancels out. Although this explanation seems reasonable, it fails to take into account the fact that the force exerted by the string is negligible compared to the forces acting upon both objects individually. As a result, her reasoning is flawed."}

We find that the timing of reionization depends strongly on halo mass; massive clusters are able to ionize their surroundings before low-mass galaxies can do so. The dependence is such that there may be no overlap between the regions surrounding different galaxy groups or clusters at all. This effect could explain why we see only patchy Lyman-alpha absorption around some nearby systems but not others. In addition, we show how this effect changes when one considers the environment of each system as well as its own properties.

These observations provide important constraints on theories of planet formation by revealing the physical conditions under which planets form. For example, recent studies suggest that giant planets may form at large distances from their host stars through gravitational instability (Boss 1997; Durisen et al. 2007 ). This process requires relatively cool gas and dust temperatures (T<300 K) so that the Toomre Q parameter remains below unity throughout the disk (Toomre 1964) . If this condition is met, then self-gravitating clumps will grow until they reach masses comparable to those of Jupiter or Saturn before being disrupted by tidal forces (Gammie 2001; Rice et al. 2003) . Since the temperature distribution in such disks depends sensitively on the amount of heating provided by stellar radiation, it should be possible to use spatially resolved observations of infrared excesses to determine whether gravitationally unstable regions exist near the outer edge of protoplanetary disks (Kenyon & Hartmann 1987; Chiang & Goldreich 1997; D'Alessio et al. 1998; Calvet et al. 2002; Dullemond 2002a ) ."}
{"text":"We present the radio through X-ray spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for 38 quasars with broad absorption lines in their optical spectra, selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 5 quasar catalog and observed by Chandra and\/or XMM-Newton.

In addition, we detect several objects which exhibit extremely flat radio-to-X-ray slopes indicative of relativistic beaming effects. These results suggest that BAL quasars represent an important phase in the evolution of luminous active galactic nuclei during which they undergo rapid changes in physical conditions within their central regions.

{"text":"The gravitational force between two objects is proportional to the product of their masses, and inversely proportional to the square of the distance separating them.  The same relationship holds true for repulsive gravity as well.   In this article we will examine how such an effect can be modeled using creation in place of mass.    Creation is defined by Einstein's field equations as:  G = 8\u03c0G\/c4T00 where T00 represents the energy density of space-time.  We will show that if one object has more creation than another then it exerts a greater repulsive force on its neighbor.   This effect may explain why some stars are surrounded by dark matter while others do not. It also provides insight into the nature of black holes which have been observed to emit radiation but no light. Gravitational attraction occurs when two bodies exert mutual forces upon each other due to their respective masses.  If body A has twice the mass of body B then it exerts double the force on body B compared to what body B exerts on itself.  Similarly, if body C has three times the mass of body D then it exerts triple the force on body D compared to what body D exerts on itself.  Force is measured in newtons (N) or dynes (dyne)."}

{"text":"We present an equation-of-state (EOS) model for solar matter that is based on the path integral formalism and includes quantum nuclear effects in the form of shell corrections, which are calculated using realistic nuclear interactions. The EOS covers densities ranging from 0 to 1.5 times normal density at temperatures between 10^6 K and 5\u00d710^8 K. We compare our results against those obtained by other authors who used different methods or approximations. Our new EOS agrees well with previous calculations within their respective domains of validity but extends these into previously unexplored regions. In particular we find that the pressure increases more rapidly than predicted by standard models when approaching the center of the Sun. This leads to higher central temperatures and lower radii compared to standard models. These differences may be important for understanding the structure of stars like the Sun as well as for modeling stellar evolution. \n \n Keywords: Solar interior"}
{"text":"We study the dynamics of free fermions hopping between sites of an arbitrary connected graph, with no restriction to nearest-neighbor hopping. We show that this system is equivalent to a collection of independent random walks evolving in parallel and interacting via pairwise collisions at vertices. The collision rate depends only on the number of particles present at each vertex; it vanishes for graphs without loops or multiple edges (e.g., trees), but can be arbitrarily large otherwise. This model exhibits interesting behavior even when all rates are equal, including anomalous diffusion and superdiffusion. In particular, we prove that the mean-square displacement grows as t3\/2 for any tree-like graph, while it scales faster than t2\/3 for general graphs. Finally, we discuss possible extensions of our results beyond the free-fermion case. Introduction: A wide variety of physical phenomena ranging from quantum transport through mesoscopic systems [1] , to population biology [2] , involve non-equilibrium particle dynamics on networks. These models typically assume that particles move along directed links according to some prescribed rules, such as unrestricted hopping [3] . However, many real-world situations require more complicated interactions among particles [4] .\nIn this work, we consider a simple generalization of standard one-dimensional lattice models [5] by allowing particles to hop freely between adjacent nodes of an arbitrary connected graph G = (V, E). More precisely, let us fix a finite set S of states associated with each node v \u2208 V ; then, given a configuration c : V \u2192 S, we define the state space C(G) := {c: V \u2192 S}. For every edge e = {u, v} \u2208 E, we associate two transition probabilities p+(c, c')(e) \u2265 0 and p\u2212(c, c')(u, v) > 0; these represent the probability per unit time that a particle located at u jumps to v if its current state is c, and vice versa. Then, the evolution of the system is described by a continuous-time Markov process Xt taking values in C(G).\nThe main goal of this Letter is to analyze the"}

In this case we find that the mixed meson masses are systematically lower than those obtained from single exponential fits to the corresponding correlators.  This effect can be explained as an artifact due to excited state contamination.  To remove it, we fit the data simultaneously to three exponentials (two ground states and one excited state) and obtain consistent values for all the masses within statistical errors.  For the second method, we calculate the effective masses of the mixed mesons and then perform a linear extrapolation to infinite time separation.  Again, our results agree well with each other.

However, when this parameter is increased beyond some critical value, new types of vortex solutions appear which have no analogs in the purely electric-coupled system.

Recently it was shown by one of us [5] that SG-like equations can be derived within the framework of microscopic BCS theory [6] if one considers only the lowest-order terms in the expansion of the order parameters in powers of the applied external field H. This approach leads to two different versions of the SG model: One version describes Josephson vortices between layers coupled electrically [7, 8] while another version takes into account also magnetic interactions [9] .\nIn Ref.

It turns out that there exist three basic classes of vortex solutions depending on the strength of the interlayer tunneling amplitude t 0 : For weak tunneling amplitudes the solution corresponds to a single Josephson vortex located at each layer; for intermediate values of t 0 the vortex solutions consist of a pair of counterrotating Josephson vortices localized near opposite sides of the junction; finally"}

The results suggest that the low energy excitations are dominated by spin fluctuations rather than charge fluctuations. In addition to this we find that there exists an additional peak structure around the Fermi level which cannot be explained within the conventional picture based on local excitations.

INTRODUCTORY REMARK\nThe two-dimensional (2D) doped Mott insulator is one of the most interesting subjects in condensed matter physics because it can exhibit various types of novel phenomena such as high-Tc superconductivity [1] , colossal magnetoresistance [2] , and quantum Hall effect [3] . It is believed that these phenomena originate from strong electron correlations between electrons [4] .\nIn order to understand the physical properties of strongly correlated systems theoretically, many numerical methods have been developed so far [5] - [8] . Among them, the dynamical mean-field theory [9] provides us with useful insights into the ground state properties [10] - [12] . However, since its applicability is limited only to the weak-coupling regime, it fails to describe the excited-state properties correctly [13] .

{"text":"We present new results on the relationship between the luminosity, radius, and velocity dispersion of the BLR (broad line region) for a sample of Seyfert 1 galaxies with measured time lags using HST\/FOS spectroscopy. We find that the virial product is proportional to L(5100A)2.3 over four orders of magnitude in luminosity. The best-fit value of 2.3 agrees well with previous studies based on optical data alone. However, we also show that this scaling relation breaks down at low luminosities where the FWHM becomes dominated by instrumental resolution effects rather than intrinsic widths. This effect can be corrected if one uses an appropriate aperture correction factor which depends only weakly on luminosity. Finally, we use our measurements of the BLR sizes to estimate black hole masses for these objects. These are compared to those derived from stellar kinematics as well as other methods such as the M-\u03c3 relation."}

We find that CHs have more open field lines than quiet regions, but they also contain many closed loops. The total unsigned magnetic flux density is higher for CHs than for quiet regions at all heights above the photosphere. In addition to this difference in the amount of magnetic flux, we found that the spatial distributions are different as well; the magnetic flux density decreases faster with height in CHs compared to quiet regions. This result suggests that there may be some differences in the physical processes occurring in these two types of solar regions. Keywords: Solar corona, Vector magnetogram, Open field line, Closed loop, Coronal hole, Quiet region. 1 Introduction Coronal holes (CHs), which appear darker in white light images taken by coronagraphs onboard satellites such as SOHO or STEREO, are known to play an important role in space weather because their open magnetic fields allow fast solar winds to escape into interplanetary space (e.g., Wang et al. (1998) , Cranmer & van Ballegooijen (2005) ).\nThe structure of CHs has been studied extensively both observationally and theoretically. It was suggested early on that CHs consist mainly of open field lines connected to remote parts of the Sun (Krieger et al. (1971) ), while closed loops were rarely seen inside them (Wiegelmann et al. (2010a) ). However, recent observations show that CHs do contain closed loops (Wiegelmann etal. (2010b) , Parnell et al. (2011 ), DeForest et al. (2013 , Brooks et al. (2014) ). These results suggest that CHs should not simply be regarded as open-field regions without any closed-loop structures."}

This problem arises naturally in many physical situations such as traffic flow [1] , molecular motors [2] or granular gases [3] . Here, we consider the so-called two-component symmetric exclusion process (TCSP), i.e., a system consisting of two species of indistinguishable particles A and B evolving according to the following rules [4] : Particles of type A and B move independently on a ring of L sites by alternating between neighboring sites with rates p and q respectively. If both types of particles attempt to occupy the same site simultaneously then either the A-particle hops forward while the B-particle stays put or vice versa depending on whether p > q or p < q. Note that these processes conserve the number of each kind of particles separately but not their total number N = nA + nB. Therefore, the dynamics of the TCSP is described by the master equation"}
{"text":"We present an explicit, physically sound formulation for the dynamical Casimir effect (DCE) in terms of a time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation with a non-Hermitian effective potential that is derived directly from first principles and has no free parameters.  The resulting expression agrees exactly with previous results obtained by other authors using different methods but it also provides new insights into this fascinating quantum phenomenon. In particular we show how to calculate the energy spectrum of the system as well as its decay rates and lifetimes. We demonstrate our approach on two examples - one involving a single harmonic oscillator coupled to a thermal bath at finite temperature and another where the oscillators are replaced by fermions. Finally, we discuss possible extensions of these ideas beyond the standard model of particle physics. The dynamical Casimir effect (DCE), predicted more than twenty years ago [1-3], refers to the generation of photons due to vacuum fluctuations when macroscopic objects move or change shape [4] . This intriguing prediction was confirmed experimentally only recently [5-7] , although there have been earlier suggestions [8] .\nThe original theoretical description of the DCE relied heavily on phenomenological models which were not always easy to interpret physically [9] . More recent attempts [10-12] used microscopic approaches based on non-relativistic QED [13-15] or relativistic field theory [16] . However, all such treatments involve some ad-hoc assumptions about the form of the interaction between the moving object(s) and the electromagnetic fields [17] .

{"text":"We present the results of an analysis of magnetic field evolution, temperature variation, and plasma flow velocity observed by Hinode\/SOT\/SP (Solar Optical Telescope Spectro-Polarimeter) on September 24-25, 2007 during solar minimum period. The active region NOAA 10930 was located at S19E09 when it produced two flares with GOES class M5.7 and M1.0 respectively. We found that there were significant changes in the photospheric magnetic fields before and after these flares. In particular, we detected a new flux emergence event which occurred about one hour prior to the first flare. This newly emerged flux led to the formation of a coronal hole overlying the active region. After the second flare, the polarity inversion line moved toward the center of the active region where the strongest magnetic shear existed. During this time interval, we also found a rapid decrease in the intensity of the Fe xxi emission lines near the footpoints of the loops connecting opposite-polarities. These observations suggest that the energy released by the flares may have caused heating of the loop-top regions as well as evaporation of chromospheric material into the corona along the reconnected loops."}

It has been shown in [1] , [4] that any solution y(x) of this type of QODE satisfies the relation \nfor all n \u2265 2 where c i 's are constants depending upon initial values. This implies that the solutions have infinitely many poles along the line at infinity. Therefore it seems difficult to find out the exact form of the solutions.

{"text":"We report an observation of a large coronal mass ejection (CME) associated with a halo-type flare that occurred in active region NOAA 10486 on 2006 December 13, which was observed by Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory (STEREO). The CME speed is estimated to be about 1450 km\/s at 1 AU using STEREO observations. We find that this CME originated from a complex magnetic structure consisting of two opposite-polarity flux systems connected by a filament channel. In addition, we found that there were several small-scale brightenings around the main sunspots before the onset of the flare\/CME activity. These brightenings are identified as ephemeral regions (ERs), which are known to play important roles for triggering eruptions such as flares or CMEs. By analyzing high-resolution images taken by Hinode\/SOT\/SP, we show that one of these ERs interacted strongly with the surrounding magnetic field lines during its rapid rotation. This interaction caused reconnection between open and closed magnetic fields, resulting in the formation of a current sheet below the ER. Then, the eruption started when the current sheet became unstable due to the kink instability."}
{"text":"The purpose of this study is to investigate how privacy issues are perceived by users in Europe and what their attitude towards these issues is, when using online learning environments (OLE). The research questions are: \nWhat do students think about privacy?\nHow does student's perception change over time?\nWhich factors influence students' attitudes on privacy? How can we measure it? What are the implications for OLE developers? This article presents results from two surveys conducted with university students at different universities across Europe between 2004-2006. It shows that there has been little change in the way students perceive privacy since 2004. Students' concerns have not changed significantly either; they still worry most about personal information being shared without permission or control. However, some differences were found among countries. In addition, the findings show that gender plays a role as well as age. Finally, the authors discuss possible reasons behind the observed trends and provide recommendations for future work."}
{"text":"We study finite temperature effects on the Standard Model (SM) by using the Seiberg-Witten map to embed it into noncommutative geometry, which is then used as an infrared regulator for the SM at high temperatures. We find that the embedding leads to new terms in the effective action involving fermions and gauge bosons, which are suppressed by powers of the noncommutativity scale $\\Lambda$. These terms can be interpreted as contributions due to virtual particles propagating along closed loops in spacetime. In particular we show how these loop contributions lead to modifications of the Higgs potential and the masses of the W and Z bosons. The results obtained here agree well with those found previously within the context of the electroweak phase transition. \nThe work presented here was supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada under grant number RGPIN-2007-03516 . \nIntroduction: Noncommutative geometry has been shown to provide a useful framework for studying quantum field theories [1] , including the Standard Model [2] - [4] .

{"text":"We present the results of our study on the correlation between black hole mass and spheroidal luminosity in nearby galaxies, using data obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). We have used two different methods to estimate the masses of supermassive black holes at the centers of these galaxies; one based on stellar dynamics and another method which uses the widths of broad emission lines as an indicator for the central black hole mass. The sample consists of 29 elliptical galaxies within 40 Mpc distance. Our main result is that we find no significant difference between the black hole masses derived by both methods. This indicates that there exists a tight relationship between the black hole mass and the total luminosity of its host galaxy. In addition, we also found evidence that this relationship does not depend strongly on the morphological type or environment of the host galaxy. These findings are consistent with theoretical predictions made by Silk & Rees (1998) who suggested that feedback processes play an important role in regulating star formation activity in galactic bulges."}
{"text":"We present new results on the properties and evolution of early-type galaxies (ETGs) in the Coma cluster, based on deep HST\/ACS imaging data obtained as part of our ongoing survey for faint globular clusters associated with ETGs.  We find that the majority of brightest cluster members are elliptical or lenticular galaxies, while only one galaxy is classified as an S0\/a galaxy. The fraction of S0s increases towards fainter luminosities, reaching about 50% at M V = \u221218 mag. This result suggests that most S0s were formed through morphological transformation of late-type spirals during their infall into the cluster environment. In addition to this morphological transformation scenario, we also consider other possible mechanisms such as ram pressure stripping by intracluster gas and tidal interactions between galaxies. By comparing the observed number density profiles of globular clusters around different types of ETGs, we show that there exists no significant difference among these three populations."}
{"text":"We have developed an improved photoionization model for the soft X-ray spectrum of the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 4151, based on its optical and UV properties as well as previous observations in the X-ray band.  We find that the observed soft X-ray emission is dominated by line emission from highly ionized species such as O viii-xxii, Ne ix-xiii, Mg xii-xv, Si xiv-xxvi, S xix-xxxi, Ar xxviii-xxxviii, Ca xx-xxxiii, Fe xx-xxxvi, Ni xx-xxxvii, and possibly also C v-vi. In addition to these lines we predict significant contributions from continuum emission due to free-free processes (bremsstrahlung) and recombination radiation. Our best-fit parameters are consistent with those found previously using other methods. However, our results suggest that the gas density may be higher than estimated before, while the ionization parameter appears lower."}
{"text":"We study the glass transition of an ensemble of adhesive hard spheres with repulsive interactions decaying as 1\/r6, where r is distance between particles. We find that this system exhibits two distinct relaxation processes at low temperatures: one fast process associated with local rearrangements within clusters of strongly bonded particles; another slower process related to collective motion of these clusters. The latter process can be described by mode-coupling theory (MCT) for colloidal suspensions. However, we show that MCT fails quantitatively when applied directly to our data because it does not take into account the presence of strong bonds which lead to additional slow modes. By introducing a simple modification to MCT, we are able to obtain excellent agreement with experimental results over several decades in time and frequency. This modified version of MCT also predicts correctly the temperature dependence of the structural relaxation time near Tg. Our work shows how quantitative tests of theoretical predictions may help improve their accuracy and applicability range."}
{"text":"We present new observations at millimeter wavelengths (1.2 mm and 3mm) toward the W3 Giant Molecular Cloud, which is one of the most active sites of star formation in our Galaxy. We have detected several hundred compact sources with masses ranging between 0.01 to 10 solar masses. The majority of these objects are associated with infrared dark clouds that contain young stellar objects surrounded by dense envelopes. These results show that massive stars form out of gravitationally bound cores within GMCs. This process may be regulated by turbulence and\/or magnetic fields. \n \n Keywords: Star Formation, Infrared Dark Clouds, Millimeter Astronomy, Giant Molecular Clouds \n \n 1 Introduction \n \n Massive stars play an important role in shaping their environments through feedback processes such as radiation pressure, winds, and supernova explosions. However, it remains unclear how they form. One possibility is that massive stars form like low-mass stars via gravitational collapse of dense cores inside Giant Molecular Clouds (GMCs; e.g., McKee & Ostriker 2007). Alternatively, massive stars could form directly from turbulent flows without any intermediate core phase (e.g., Banerjee et al. 2006) . \n \n To investigate this issue we observed the W3 region using the Submillimeter Array (SMA; Ho et al. 2004 ) on Mauna Kea Observatory during two nights in November 2005. The SMA consists of eight 6 m antennas operating simultaneously at three different frequencies centered around 230 GHz, 345 GHz, and 690 GHz. At each frequency there were four basebands covering a bandwidth of 2 GHz for continuum emission and 4 GHz for spectral line studies. The primary beam size ranges from ~5\u2032\u2032 to ~20\u2032\u2032 depending on the observing frequency. The total integration time was about 12 hours per night spread over six tracks. Details of the observational setup can be found in Wu et al. (2007a) , where we presented initial results based on data taken only at 345 GHz. Here we report results obtained at all three bands."}

In particular we will focus on spectral methods based on the use of spherical harmonics expansions. These methods have been successfully applied to various types of partial differential equations arising in mathematical physics. However their application to the problem under consideration has not yet been studied systematically. Here we present several new results concerning the convergence analysis of these methods as well as their implementation details. Our approach allows us to obtain optimal order error estimates without any regularity assumptions about the exact solution or its derivatives."}
{"text":"We propose an explicit construction for a string model with gauge group SU(3)xSU(2)xU(1), three generations of quarks and leptons, right-handed neutrinos, and no exotic particles beyond those in the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM). The model is based on type IIA string theory compactified to four dimensions on a Calabi-Yau manifold X which has h^{1,1} = 1 and h^{1,2} = 0. We consider a stack of N=2 D6-branes wrapping a divisor S inside X that supports a non-abelian gauge symmetry U(N_c) where N_c = 3. In addition we introduce two sets of fractional branes at singularities of order 6 along divisors T_1 and T_2 such that the total number of D6-branes is 24. By using mirror symmetry arguments it can be shown that this configuration preserves one half of the original supersymmetry."}

{"text":"The formation of dipoles in self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) on metal surfaces is investigated by scanning tunneling microscopy\/spectroscopy (STM\/STS). The SAM consists of octadecanethiols with an end group that contains either one or two thiocyanates, which are known to form strong dipole moments upon adsorption onto gold substrates. We find that the presence of these strongly polarizable groups leads to significant changes in the electronic structure of the SAM compared to nonpolar alkane chains. In particular, we observe a shift of the molecular states towards higher energies as well as a reduction of their spatial extension perpendicular to the surface. These effects can be explained within a simple model based on electrostatic interactions between the molecules and the substrate. Our results demonstrate how chemical functionalization allows for tailoring the properties of organic films deposited on metallic surfaces. Dipole formation at interfaces of alkanethiolate self-assembled monolay- ers and Ag(111) has been studied using scanning tunneling microscopy\/ spectroscopy (STM\/S). The SAM was prepared by chemisorption of octadecanethiol containing thiocyanate endgroups on Ag(111), resulting in a film with a large dipole moment per unit area. STM images show ordered structures consisting of rows of bright protrusions separated by darker areas. STS measurements reveal shifts of the molecular states towards larger energy values when going from the center of the row to its edge. This effect is attributed to the electric field generated by the dipole layer."}
{"text":"We study the dynamics of an interface driven by a periodic external force in one dimension, using molecular dynamics simulations with Lennard-Jones particles at low temperatures (T = 0.1 \u2212 1). We find that the interface moves as a whole when it is driven slowly enough; otherwise, it breaks into several segments which move independently. The number of segments increases with increasing driving frequency or decreasing temperature. In addition to these two regimes, we observe another regime where the interface exhibits stick-slip motion. This third regime occurs for intermediate values of the driving amplitude A and driving frequency f . For this regime, we show that there exists a scaling relation between the average velocity V , the driving frequency f , and the driving amplitude A: V \u221d Af 2 .

{"text":"We report the results of neutron scattering experiments on the spin-1\/2 Kagome compound ZnCu3(OH)6Cl2 (ZnCr2O4). We find that this material is in fact a S = 1\/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet with nearest-neighbor exchange interactions J1 and J2, where J2 \/J1 ~ 0.5. The observed magnetic structure consists of two interpenetrating triangular sublattices which are canted by an angle \u03b8 ~ 13\u00b0 relative to each other. This structure can be described as a coplanar 120\u00b0 spiral state with wave vector q0 = (1\/2, 1\/2, 1\/6), or equivalently as a collinear stripe phase with periodicity three times larger than expected for a simple triangle lattice. These findings demonstrate that the physics of the Kagome lattice cannot always be understood within the framework of a single-ion anisotropy model. In particular, we show how our data rule out any description based solely on Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions."}
{"text":"The standard model is the most successful theory in particle physics, but it fails to explain gravity. In this article we present an alternative approach that unifies general relativity with quantum mechanics by using a new concept called \"quantum potential energy density\" (QPD). We show how QPD can be used as a source for gravitational field equations which are derived from Hamilton's principle of least action. The resulting field equations have solutions similar to those obtained from Einstein's field equations. However, unlike Einstein's field equations, our proposed field equations do not contain any free parameters such as cosmological constant or dark matter. This means that all physical phenomena predicted by these two theories should agree exactly if they are based on the same underlying principles. Finally, we discuss some possible experimental tests of our proposal. The standard model is the most succesful theory in particle physics, however it fails to explain gravity. \n \n In this article we present another approach that unifies general relavity with quantum mechanics by introducing a new concept called \u201cquantum potental energy density\u201d(QPD). \n \n Quantum potential energy density has been introduced previously by several authors [1-5], but its role was limited only to explaining certain aspects of quantum mechanics like uncertainty relations [6], tunneling effect [7-9], wave-particle duality [10-12] etc.. \n \n Here we propose a novel interpretation of QPD where it plays a central role in deriving gravitational field equations.

{"text":"The development and application of superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) in magnetic resonance imaging has been reviewed, with emphasis on the recent advances made by our group at UCLA. The SQUID is an extremely sensitive magnetometer that can be used to detect very small changes in the local magnetic field produced by nuclear spins during NMR experiments. In this review we describe how these devices have been incorporated into several different types of low-field MRI systems including micro-SQUID arrays fabricated using standard semiconductor processing techniques as well as macroscopic SQUID gradiometers developed specifically for use in human brain studies. We also discuss some of the challenges associated with operating such instruments under conditions where the ambient magnetic fields are not completely shielded or controlled. Finally, we present results obtained recently using one of these new technologies to study the effects of anesthesia on functional connectivity within the human brain. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), which was first demonstrated more than 30 years ago, provides detailed information about the structure and function of living tissues through noninvasive measurements of their water content [1] . This technique relies upon the detection of tiny radio-frequency signals emitted by hydrogen nuclei when they precess around the main magnetic field B 0 , which is generated by a large electromagnet [2] .\nIn conventional clinical scanners, the strength of B 0 ranges between 1 T and 3 T [3] . However, there are many applications where it would be desirable to perform MRI scans at much lower fields [4] . For example, the use of high-field magnets may cause significant heating problems due to dielectric losses in biological tissue [5] . Moreover, the cost of building and maintaining such large-scale facilities makes them inaccessible to most research laboratories [6] . Another disadvantage of working at higher fields is related to the fact that the relaxation times of protons become shorter [7, 8] . As a result, the signal-to-noise ratio decreases rapidly [9] making it difficult to obtain high-quality images [10] ."}
{"text":"We present an approach to validating the performance of machine-learning algorithms for identifying modules in networks, based on synthetic datasets generated by simulating random walks through known modular structures. We show that this method can be used to identify and rank different types of modules with high accuracy across a range of sizes and densities. The results are robust against noise and missing links. This validation strategy is useful both as a benchmarking tool for comparing competing methods and also as a means of assessing how well existing approaches perform when applied to real-world systems. In recent years there has been growing interest in developing computational tools capable of detecting functional units within complex biological networks such as protein-protein interaction (PPI) or gene regulatory networks [1\u20133] .

{"text":"We study the crossover between Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) and Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer superfluidity in an ultracold trapped two-component fermionic gas with unequal masses by using the mean-field theory based on the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations. We find that, for equal interaction strengths, the condensate fraction is larger than that of the single component case when one mass is much lighter than the other; while it becomes smaller if both masses are comparable to each other.  The critical temperature T_c decreases as the difference between the masses increases. For large enough mass ratio, we observe a first-order phase transition at low temperatures instead of second order. In addition, we show that there exists a tricritical point where the phase transition changes from second-to-first order. Finally, we calculate the density profiles of the system under different conditions numerically. \nI. INTRODUCTIO N\nUltracold atomic gases have been widely used to simulate many-body quantum systems [1] . Recently, great progress has been made in studying strongly correlated fermions [2] , especially those with spin degrees of freedom [3] .\nIn particular, the recent experimental realization of BoseEinstein condensation (BEC), i.e., macroscopic occupation of the lowest energy state [4] , in a dilute gas of bosonic atoms opens up new possibilities to explore novel phenomena such as Cooper pairing [5] or supersolidity [6] in fermion systems [7, 8] . It also provides us with a unique opportunity to investigate the interplay between these two kinds of quantum phases [9] . On the theoretical side, this problem can be studied within the framework of the so-called Bose-Fermi mixture model [10] which describes a mixture of interacting bosons and noninteracting fermions [11] . This approach was originally developed to describe nuclear matter [12] but later found applications in various fields including cold atom physics [13] . However, most previous studies were focused on the cases where all particles have identical masses [14] . In real experiments, however, the masses of the constituent particles may not always be exactly the same [15] . Therefore"}
{"text":"We study the entanglement properties of two qubits coupled by an antisymmetric anisotropic exchange interaction (AAEI) in a magnetic chain described by the Heisenberg model on the square lattice. We show that for certain values of the parameters, this system can be mapped onto a spin-1\/2 XYZ chain and we calculate analytically its concurrence as well as the von Neumann entropy. The results are compared to those obtained numerically using exact diagonalization techniques. In particular, it is shown that the AAEI leads to a significant increase of the concurrence between nearest-neighboring spins when compared to the standard XXZ case. Moreover, we find that there exists a critical value of the anisotropy parameter beyond which no entanglement survives. Finally, we discuss how our findings could be tested experimentally. Introduction:-Entangled states play a crucial role in quantum information processing [1] . Therefore, understanding their generation mechanisms has been one of the main goals of many theoretical investigations [2] - [4] .\nIn recent years, much attention was paid to the investigation of entanglement in various types of spin chains [5] , including the so-called XXZ chain [6]- [8] . However, most studies were focused only on the ground state [9] or low lying excited states [10] of these systems. On the other hand, recently developed experimental techniques allow us to prepare highly excited states [11] . Thus, it becomes important to investigate also higher energy levels [12] .\nThe aim of this work is to analyze the entanglement properties of a pair of qubits interacting via an antisymmetric anisotropic Heisenberg exchange term [13] . This type of coupling appears naturally in several physical models [14] - [16] . For example, it describes the spin-spin interactions in molecular magnets [17] where the total angular momentum J = 0 [18] . It should be noted here that such molecules have attracted considerable interest due to their potential applications in quantum computing [19] . Another interesting application concerns the description of excitations in high-Tc superconductors [20] . Here, the presence of the antisymmetric anisotropic exchange term may lead to new phenomena [21] ."}
{"text":"We study the entanglement between two atoms trapped inside an optical cavity, each interacting with one mode of the electromagnetic field. We consider both resonant and nonresonant interactions for different initial states of the system. In particular we show that it is possible to generate maximally entangled Bell-like states by using only local operations on the atomic subsystem. The results are obtained by solving numerically the Schr\u00f6dinger equation describing the evolution of the system. Entanglement plays a crucial role in quantum information processing [1] . It has been shown [2] , however, that even if all parties involved share maximal entanglement at some point during their communication protocol they may not be able to perform any useful task due to decoherence effects [3] .\nIn this work we investigate how entanglement can be generated among two atoms trapped inside an open optical cavity [4] . Each atom interacts locally with its own photon mode which is coupled to another external photon mode via a mirror (see Fig.  1 ). This model describes many physical systems such as semiconductor microcavities [5] or cold atoms [6] . For example, in Ref. [7] it was proposed to use a Bose-Einstein condensate confined within a high-finesse Fabry-Perot cavity [8] to produce single photons [9] . These photons could then be used to entangle distant qubits [10] ."}
{"text":"We present analytic models for the potentials that can produce multiple images in strong gravitational lenses, and we use these to study how well different mass profiles are constrained by observations. We find that it is possible to obtain good constraints on both the total enclosed mass within an Einstein radius (the projected distance at which two images merge) and the slope of the density profile outside this radius using only three or four multiply-imaged systems with accurate photometric redshifts.  The results presented here should be useful for planning future surveys aimed at measuring dark matter properties through gravitational lensing. Gravitational lensing provides one of our most powerful tools for studying the distribution of dark matter in galaxies and clusters. In particular, if a galaxy cluster has been lensed into several distinct images, then the positions and fluxes of those images provide information about the shape of the cluster's gravitational potential as a function of position along its line-of-sight. This allows us to measure the total enclosed mass within some characteristic scale length, such as the Einstein radius, where two images merge together. However, because there are many degeneracies between the parameters describing the lens model, it is not always straightforward to determine what kind of mass profile best describes the data."}
{"text":"We report on timing observations made with the Arecibo Observatory of PSR J1453+1903, which is one of only two known isolated (non-millisecond) pulsars in globular clusters. We find that its spin-down rate is consistent with it being powered by magnetic dipole radiation; this implies an age for the cluster of about 12 Gyrs. The pulsar's dispersion measure indicates that it lies at a distance of about 4 kpc from Earth. Its inferred surface dipolar magnetic field strength is 1.1 x 10^10 Gauss, making it among the strongest ever measured for any pulsar. This value is also comparable to those found for other young pulsars in open clusters. \n \n In addition we have observed PSR J1453 + 1903 over several years using the Green Bank Telescope.

No significant gravitational-wave candidates were found above background noise levels. Upper limits on the rate density of gravitational-wave bursts are presented at 90% confidence level. These upper limits can be used to constrain theoretical models of short-duration gravitational-wave emission mechanisms."}
{"text":"We study the dynamic properties of molecular motors by using burnt-bridge models, which are simple kinetic Monte Carlo simulations for motor proteins such as kinesin and myosin V. We show that these models reproduce several experimental results on single-molecule experiments with high accuracy.  In particular, we find that the velocity distribution is well described by an exponential function at low load force but deviates from it when the load increases. The mean square displacement shows subdiffusive behavior under large loads. These behaviors can be explained by considering the effect of the elasticity of the cargoes carried by the motors. Our model also reproduces the dependence of stall forces on external viscous drag coefficients observed experimentally. Finally, our simulation results suggest that the number of steps taken per ATP hydrolysis cycle decreases exponentially with increasing load force. This result may explain why the step size fluctuation becomes larger than expected theoretically near stalling conditions. \nI. INTRODUCTIO N\nMolecular motors play important roles in many biological processes including muscle contraction [1] , vesicle transport [2] , chromosome segregation [3] , and cell division [4] . They convert chemical energy into mechanical work through repeated cycles of binding to cytoskeletal filaments (e.g., microtubules) and releasing them [5] .\nThe most extensively studied class of molecular motors is the kinesins [6] . Kinesins walk along microtubules toward their plus ends [7, 8] . Myosins move towards actin filaments' minus ends [9] . Both types of motors have been shown to take discrete steps [10 -12] . Recent studies have revealed that both kinesins [13] and myosins [14] exhibit stochastic stepping motions even without external loads [15 -19] . It has been suggested that this randomness arises mainly due to thermal fluctuations [20, 21] or internal noise [22] . However, there still remain open questions about how they respond to external loads [23] .\nIn order to understand the mechanism underlying the operation of molecular motors, various theoretical approaches have been developed so far [24] . Among those methods, kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations [25] provide useful information on"}
{"text":"We present the light-cone distribution amplitudes (DAs) for axial vector mesons in terms of their helicity components, which are determined by solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation with an instantaneous interaction kernel and applying the method developed recently to calculate DAs.  We find that the twist-2 DA is dominated by its first Gegenbauer moment, while higher moments contribute significantly only at large momentum fractions x > 0.7. The twist-3 DA has two independent functions, one of them being proportional to the second Gegenbauer moment. Our results show that the twist-4 contribution is negligible compared to those of lower twists. These findings will be useful for studying exclusive processes involving axial vector mesons such as B-decays into charmonium plus photon or pion pair. \nI. INTRODUCTIO N\nThe study of hadronic structure plays an important role in understanding strong interactions between quarks and gluons inside hadrons. In particular, the investigation on the parton distributions provides us valuable information about how quarks and gluon are distributed within hadrons [1] . Recently, there have been great interests in exploring the internal structures of hadrons beyond the leading-twist level [2] , especially the transverse-momentum dependent parton distributions [3] .\nIn this work we focus our attention on another type of nonperturbative objects -the light-cone distribution amplitudes(DAs). They describe the probability amplitude of finding a quark-antiquark pair with certain longitudinal momentum fraction and transverse separation at some fixed light-like distance [4] . It was shown that they play crucial roles in describing various hard exclusive reactions [5] . For example, the decay constants fB\u03c0 and fBs can be expressed in terms of the lowest-order DAs [6] ; the form factors of semileptonic decays B\u2192\u03c0l\u03bd l and B\u2192Kl\u03bd l depend on both the lowest-and next-to-lowest order DAs [7, 8] .

{"text":"We present new high angular resolution observations of the massive protostellar system, Orion Source I (OSI), obtained with ALMA in Band 7 and 9 at an average spatial resolution of 0.3 arcsec. We detect emission lines of SiO(5-4) and HCO+(4-3). The observed line profiles are consistent with those expected for Keplerian rotation around a central object of mass ~10 Msun. Using these results we derive physical parameters such as disk inclination angle, radius, temperature, density structure etc., which can be used to test theoretical models of circumstellar disks. In addition, we find that the kinematics of the innermost region probed by our data is dominated by infall motions rather than outflowing gas. This suggests that OSI may have recently undergone rapid accretion onto its central star. Finally, we also report detection of two compact continuum sources within the primary beam of the telescope."}
{"text":"We present the first detailed analysis of the early photospheric evolution of Nova Scorpii 2004 # 1, based on high-resolution optical spectroscopy obtained with the Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph mounted at the Very Large Telescope in Chile.  The nova was discovered by amateur astronomers on March 31st, 2004, when it reached an apparent magnitude of 8.7. We find that the ejecta are expanding at velocities between 1000 km\/s to 3000 km\/s. From our observations we derive a distance estimate for this object of about 3 kpc. This is consistent with previous estimates derived using other methods. Using these results as input parameters into theoretical models, we determine the chemical composition of the ejecta. Our best fit model suggests that the ejecta consist mainly of O-rich material mixed with some CNO-processed material. In addition, we detect strong emission lines originating from highly ionized species such as FeXXV\/FeXXVI or NeIX\/NX. These lines indicate that the ejecta were heated up to temperatures above 10 million K during their expansion."}
{"text":"We present an analysis of archival Chandra observations of the open cluster, RCW 49 (also known as Melotte 20). The data were obtained on September 24th and 25th 2000 with the Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS) detector operating in full-frame mode at a focal plane temperature of -120 C. We have used these data to study the stellar population within this open cluster by extracting source counts using the CIAO software package. A total of 16 sources are detected above a threshold significance level of 3 sigma. Of these sixteen sources, twelve lie inside the half-mass radius of the cluster while four lie outside it. Using photometric measurements taken from the literature we find that all but one of our detections can be associated with previously identified members of the open cluster.  From the spectral fits performed for each detection we determine their temperatures and luminosities. These values are then compared against theoretical isochrones generated by the Padova group which show good agreement between theory and observation."}
{"text":"We study the production of a sterile species in an open system with two stable particles and one unstable particle, where the decay products are not observed.  We show that if the initial state is pure then there exists no final mixed state which can be reached by unitary evolution. This result implies that the production of a sterility cannot occur under any circumstances for such systems. If we allow the possibility to prepare arbitrary states as input, however, it turns out that the production of a certain kind of sterility may still take place. In this case, the output state will always contain some amount of entanglement between the subsystems corresponding to the different types of particles involved. The results presented here have been obtained within the framework of Quantum Kinetic Theory (QKT). QKT provides a description of non-equilibrium phenomena at mesoscopic scales based on the concept of entropy production rate. It has recently attracted considerable attention due to its potential applications in many areas ranging from physics to biology. \nI. INTRODUCTORY REMARK\nThe phenomenon of spontaneous emission plays a crucial role in modern physics. For example, it is responsible for the cooling process in laser-cooling experiments [1] . On the other hand, spontaneous emission also leads to decoherence effects [2] , which limit the performance of quantum information processing devices [3] .\nIn recent years, several authors [4] - [8] studied the problem of producing a particular type of \"sterility\" in open quantum systems. A state is called \"sterile\" when it does not interact with itself or another given set of states [9] .

{"text":"We present the results of numerical simulations aimed at studying the formation and evolution of off-center ionized hydrogen (HII) regions around massive stars embedded in an isothermal, self-gravitating gas distribution with a power-law density profile.  We find that the expansion velocity of the ionization front decreases as it moves away from the star's position towards larger radii. The decrease occurs because the pressure gradient becomes smaller when moving outward due to the decreasing density. As a result, the ionization front may become unstable against small perturbations which lead to its fragmentation into several blobs or fingers. These blobs are surrounded by dense shells of neutral material produced by photo-evaporation of the surrounding medium. In addition, we show that the mass loss rate increases significantly for large values of the index n of the power law density distribution. This increase can be explained by the fact that the gravitational force per unit volume acting on the shell decreases faster than the ram pressure of the expanding bubble."}

The CKM matrix elements are predicted as well as the Majorana phase associated with leptonic CP violation. In addition we show how the tri-bimaximal pattern observed experimentally in the lepton sector emerges naturally when the quark-lepton unification hypothesis is imposed at high energies.

We also introduce an alternative approach that allows one to obtain unbiased estimates of the spherically averaged pairdensity using standard Metropolis Monte Carlo techniques without any additional computational overhead. This method is applicable when the number of particles N is large enough so that fluctuations of the total energy E = T + V due to finite-size effects become negligible compared to its variance. In this case we show how to use the fluctuation-dissipation theorem to derive a closed-form expression for the bias-free estimator of the spherically average pair density.

We find that our data are consistent with either model at the 2-sigma level; however, we cannot rule out the possibility of only one mode being present. The best-fit values for the parameters describing each distribution differ significantly between these models. If future observations confirm this result, it will have important implications on cosmological studies using SNeIa as distance indicators. In particular, if there really are two populations of SNeIa, then the use of a single value for the stretch parameter may lead to systematic errors in determining distances. \n \n Keywords: Supernova, Light curve"}
{"text":"We present exact solutions to the nonholonomic Ricci flows for Einstein spaces with torsion, which are generated by nonlinear connections (N-connections) on principal fiber bundles.

We consider two classes of exact solutions for nonlinear wave equations which are related to parametric deformations of the solitonic pp-waves and the static spherically symmetric black hole metrics. The first class contains generic off-diagonal metrics depending on one parameter that can be transformed into diagonal form via coordinate transforms preserving their dependence on this parameter. In the second case we find explicit formulas for generating new families of exact solutions to Einstein equations with arbitrary values of the cosmological constant $\\Lambda$. These solutions depend on three parameters and contain both diagonal and off-diagonal terms. They describe parametric deformations of solitoni\u0441 pp-waves and the Schwarzschild solution.

{"text":"The present work is devoted to the investigation of the photothermal properties and dynamics of the Cu2O\/CuO nanocomposite films prepared by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) on Si(100). The PLD technique allows one to obtain high-quality thin films with controlled composition, structure and morphology. It was found that the temperature dependence of the resistance R(T), measured at different light intensities I0, exhibits two distinct regimes corresponding to low-temperature metallic-like behavior and high-temperature semiconducting-like behavior. In addition, it has been shown that the transition between these regimes occurs via an intermediate state characterized by pronounced hysteresis effect. This phenomenon can be explained within the framework of the theory developed for semiconductor-metal phase transitions induced by strong non-equilibrium heating. We have also demonstrated that this model describes well the observed nonlinear response of the investigated system to external periodic driving force."}

{"text":"The optimization of the novel prismatic drive is presented in this work, which consists of two identical gears with different tooth numbers and an elastic coupling between them. The gear pair can be used to transmit torque or power by changing its operating mode. In order to obtain the optimal design parameters for the gear pair under various working conditions, a multi-objective genetic algorithm (GA) has been developed based on the Pareto concept. A series of numerical examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. It should be noted that the results obtained here may not necessarily represent the best possible solution due to the limitations of the GA approach adopted. \n \n Keywords: Gear pair, Elastic coupling, Multi-objective optimization, Genetic algorithm \n \n 1 Introduction \n \n With the rapid development of modern industry, there have been increasing demands for high efficiency transmissions. To meet these requirements, many new transmission mechanisms such as planetary gears [1] , parallel axes gears [2] , hypoid gears [3] , spur gears [4] , helical gears [5] , etc., have been invented over the past few decades. Among all these types of gears, the gear pair consisting of two gears with different tooth numbers connected through an elastic coupling [6] - [8] has attracted much attention because it can operate either as a conventional gear set or as a harmonic drive [9] . Compared with other types of gears mentioned above, the gear pair possesses several advantages including compact structure, low cost, light weight, easy maintenance, and so forth [10] . \n \n However, the gear pair also suffers some disadvantages like large backlash [11] , poor load sharing [12] , and complicated dynamic behavior [13] .

{"text":"We study the dynamics near transcritical bifurcation points for non integrable Hamiltonians with two degrees of freedom, using perturbation theory and numerical simulations.  We show that there is an infinite number of periodic orbits which are born at the bifurcation point as well as infinitely many families of quasi-periodic solutions.

Transcritical bifurcations occur when a stable fixed point loses its stability under small perturbations. In this case, new types of attractors appear nearby, including limit cycles and chaotic sets. This phenomenon has been studied extensively both theoretically and experimentally (see e.g., [1] , [3] ). However, most studies were restricted to low dimensional dynamical systems where it was possible to obtain explicit expressions for all relevant quantities.

The first class consists of spatially homogeneous Bianchi type IX models which have been studied extensively over many years as possible candidates for describing our universe at early times when its geometry was close to being flat.

{"text":"We show that the linear programming relaxation (LP) is equivalent to the max-product algorithm on general graphs, when applied to weighted matching problems with non-negative weights.  We prove this equivalence by showing how each step of the max-product algorithm can be simulated using an appropriate rounding technique based on the solution of the dual problem at hand.   The main idea behind our approach is to use the fact that any feasible primal-dual pair satisfies certain properties which we exploit to obtain a valid rounding scheme. Our results are applicable to many combinatorial optimization problems such as maximum weight bipartite matching, minimum cost flow, vertex cover etc., where the objective function has only non-negative coefficients. In particular, they imply that the integrality gap of these problems under their respective LP relaxations cannot exceed 1 + $O(1\/n)$, where $n$ denotes the number of nodes or edges in the input graph.

These techniques have been demonstrated using both laboratory experiments and field tests.

The observed power spectrum can be explained if there are two components contributing to the total flux - one steady component and another varying component. This suggests that the source of the X-rays may not be point-like but extended. Our analysis also shows that the luminosity changes significantly over time scales ranging between hours and years. These variations could be due to either intrinsic or extrinsic factors such as orbital motion of the emitting region and\/or obscuration effects caused by intervening clouds.

Introduction:-The development of modern theoretical approaches has led to significant progress in understanding the physical properties of complex quantum systems [1] . However, despite these advances there are still fundamental questions about the nature of quantum phenomena that remain unanswered [2] .\nIn recent years, several authors have attempted to address some of these issues using concepts borrowed from statistical mechanics [3] , such as entropy [4] or free energy [5] . These ideas were originally developed within the context of classical thermodynamics [6] but they have been recently extended to the realm of quantum mechanics [7, 8] . For example, one may consider the von Neumann entropy S = \u2212Tr(\u03c1 ln \u03c1) associated with the density matrix \u03c1 describing the state of a system [9] . This quantity measures the amount of uncertainty present in the measurement outcomes [10] and its time derivative dS\/dt gives rise to the so-called entropy production rate [11] . It was shown that this latter quantity plays a crucial role in characterizing the irreversible behavior of closed quantum systems [12] . More specifically, if the entropy production rate vanishes then the corresponding quantum mechanical model exhibits reversible dynamics [13] . On the other hand, when the entropy production rate becomes positive the system undergoes a non-equilibrium phase transition [14] ."}

The algorithm has been implemented using IBM Q Experience simulator with four different databases containing up to 16 items each. We have also compared our results against those obtained by running Grover's original algorithm on the same datasets. Our experimental results show that the proposed algorithm performs better than its classical counterpart when searching through small databases (up to 8 items). However, it becomes less efficient if we increase the size of the database beyond this limit. This work was supported by the Australian Research Council Discovery Project DP160103745. In recent years there has been significant interest in developing algorithms for performing quantum searches over large data sets [1] . These algorithms are expected to find applications in areas such as machine learning [2] , pattern recognition [3] , computer vision [4] , bioinformatics [5] , etc., where they will allow us to solve problems faster or more accurately [6] .\nIn general, these algorithms use N qubits to encode M elements in the database [7, 8] . For example, Grover's algorithm [9] requires O( \u221a N\/M ) iterations to find any single element out of M elements encoded into N qubits [10] . It should be noted here that the number of required iterations increases exponentially with respect to both N and M [11] .

{"text":"We study the dynamics of an ensemble of interacting vortices in a two-dimensional superfluid helium film, which is driven by a rotating substrate at constant angular velocity . We show that this system exhibits aging behavior similar to spin glasses or other disordered systems with quenched randomness. The relaxation time increases exponentially as a function of waiting time t w , i.e., the duration during which the driving has been switched off before starting the measurement. This increase can be described by a stretched exponential law exp(\u2212(t\/\u03c4)\u03b2), where \u03c4 denotes the characteristic relaxation time and \u03b2 < 1 describes its distribution width. In addition we find that the response of our system depends on the history of the applied external drive. For example, if one starts with a high rotation frequency f 0 = \u03c90\/2\u03c0 and then decreases it slowly towards zero (quasi-static protocol), the final state after switching off the drive does not depend on the initial value f0. However, if one switches off the drive suddenly (sudden protocol), the final state strongly depends on f0."}
{"text":"The origin of the most massive stars is still an open question in astrophysics, as well as their role in shaping galactic evolution. In this talk I will present recent results on how we can use observations to constrain theoretical models for the formation of these objects.  The first part of my talk will focus on the observational properties of young massive clusters (YMCs) that are found at high redshift z>6-7. These YMCs have masses up to 10^8 Msun and sizes of ~1kpc. They appear to be very compact compared with local starburst galaxies such as Arp 220 or M82 which typically contain much less dense stellar populations. We find that the observed size-mass relation of these distant YMCs agrees remarkably well with predictions based on numerical simulations of turbulent gas clouds collapsing under self-gravity. This suggests that turbulence plays an important role during the early stages of cluster formation. However, it remains unclear whether all massive stars form in such large clusters like those seen at high redshifts."}
{"text":"We present the spectroscopic follow-up observations for eight galaxy clusters at redshifts z=0.6-0.9 selected in the Red-Sequence Cluster Survey (RCS).

We have obtained spectra for more than 100 cluster members using VLT\/FORS2 and Keck\/DEIMOS spectrographs. From these data we derive velocity dispersions, dynamical mass estimates, and luminosity-weighted ages for each system. In addition to this analysis, we also study the evolution of the scaling relations as a function of redshift up to z=1.1. Our results show that the observed properties are consistent with those expected for massive systems undergoing gravitational collapse.

{"text":"In this thesis we study the problem of optimizing resource allocation in wireless networks by using non-cooperative game theory. We consider three different problems: (1) Code Optimization, (2) Power Control, and (3) Receiver Design. In each case, we formulate an optimization problem as a noncooperative game between users competing to maximize their own utility functions. Then, we propose distributed algorithms that converge to Nash equilibria of these games. Finally, we evaluate our proposed schemes through extensive simulations on both static and mobile scenarios. \n \n Keywords: Non-Cooperative Game Theory; Wireless Networks; Resource Allocation; Distributed Algorithms; Nash Equilibrium. 1 Introduction \n \n The rapid growth of wireless communication has led to increased demand for high quality services such as voice over IP (VoIP), video streaming, online gaming etc., which require efficient use of limited resources available at base stations or access points. To meet this growing demand, researchers have been working towards developing new techniques to improve the performance of existing wireless systems while maintaining low cost and energy consumption [1] . One promising approach is to optimize resource allocations among users in order to increase overall system throughput [2] , reduce interference [3] , minimize transmission delay [4] , and\/or enhance fairness [5] .\n \nThe main challenge faced when designing resource allocation strategies lies in the fact that there are usually multiple conflicting objectives [6] . For example, maximizing total user satisfaction may lead to unfair distribution of resources across users [7]; increasing spectral efficiency can cause severe inter-user interference [8] ; minimizing transmission delays may result in poor channel utilization [9] . Therefore, it becomes necessary to develop novel approaches that strike a balance between various conflicting goals [10] . \n \n This work was supported in part by NSF under Grants CNS-0721440, CCF-0729260, ECCS-0801571, and CNS-0916275."}
{"text":"We study two-dimensional twisted sigma models with target space $(X,\\mathcal{O}_X)$ where $X$ is an algebraic variety over $\\mathbb{C}$ equipped with a holomorphic volume form $\\omega$.  We show that these theories are mirror to certain twisted versions of the chiral de Rham complex on $X$ which we call the twisted chiral de Rham complexes.  These results generalise those in [Wit] , [Kaw1] , [Kaw2] . \nIn particular, if $\\mathcal{O}_X=\\mathbb{C}^n$ then our results recover the classical mirror symmetry between Calabi-Yau manifolds and Landau-Ginzburg orbifolds (see e.g., [CK] ). If $X$ has trivial canonical bundle but nontrivial Hodge numbers $h^{p,q}(X)\\neq 0$ for some $p+q=n$ then our results give rise to new examples of mirror pairs.  In this case, the mirror partner of the twisted sigma model is not a Landau-Ginzburg theory as one might expect; instead it is a so-called ``twisted generalised Landau-Ginzburg'' theory whose superpotential is given by a polynomial function $W$ satisfying certain conditions.  For example, if $X$ is a K3 surface then our results yield a new mirror pair consisting of a ``twisted generalised LG'' theory and its mirror partner. \nFinally, we discuss how our results can be used to prove the existence of certain families of mirror pairs."}
{"text":"We present the first results on black hole accretion using our new numerical scheme, which is based on an implicit-explicit time integration method and uses adaptive mesh refinement (AMR). We study two different models of accretion flows onto Kerr black holes in order to test the robustness of our code against various physical effects such as viscosity, magnetic fields, radiative cooling\/heating processes, etc.. In particular we focus on the properties of the flow at large distances from the central object where it becomes supersonic and forms shocks. Our main goal here was to check whether these features are correctly captured by our AMR code. The results show that our code reproduces all known analytical solutions very well. \n \n Keywords: Black holes - General relativity - Numerical methods - Shocks - Supersonic turbulence - Time-dependent simulations \n \n \n \n 1 Introduction \n \n It has been more than 30 years since the discovery of quasars [1] . Since then there have been many theoretical studies trying to explain how supermassive black holes grow so rapidly [2] , but only recently were the first observational data available [3] . These observations suggest that most galaxies contain massive black holes with masses ranging between 10^6 M_sol < M_blackhole < 10^9 M_sol [4] . This poses serious challenges for current theories of galaxy formation because they predict much smaller values for the mass of the central black hole [5] . \n \n One possible solution to this problem could be provided by so-called active galactic nuclei (AGN), i.e., systems containing a supermassive black hole surrounded by an accretion disk [6] . If the gas density in the disk is high enough, the gravitational field of the black hole can cause the infalling matter to lose angular momentum through viscous stresses [7, 8] . As a result, the gas falls towards the center of the system forming a geometrically thin accretion disk [9] . However, if the gas density drops below some critical value, the disk may become unstable [10] or even fragment into clumps [11] . Such instabilities lead to the development of large-scale"}
{"text":"We study the ground-state properties of two-flavor color superconducting (2SC) quark matter at finite density and temperature by using an effective chiral model with vector interaction, which is derived from QCD under the mean-field approximation. We find that there exists a new type of 2SC phase where quarks are paired into diquark condensates with different colors but same flavor. This novel phase has been named as Larkin-Ovchinnikova-Fulde-Ferreell (LOFF) state because it was first proposed to describe superfluidity in nuclear systems. In this LOFF state, we show that the gap parameter for pairing between quarks with opposite momenta depends on their relative angle. The magnitude of the gap decreases rapidly when they move away from each other along the Fermi surface. As a result, the energy gap vanishes completely near the boundary of the Brillouin zone."}
{"text":"We prove that any two quantum states can be distinguished with certainty using only separable operations, i.e., tensor products of local measurements on each subsystem.  We also show how to construct such an optimal measurement for distinguishing between the given pair of states. This result is in contrast to the classical case where it has been shown that there exist pairs of nonorthogonal pure states which cannot be distinguished with certainty even when all possible measurements are allowed. The proof relies heavily on the fact that every state vector can be written as a convex combination of product vectors and uses ideas similar to those used in proving the Hahn-Banach theorem. \nI. INTRODUCTIO N\nThe problem of distinguishability of quantum states was first studied by Helstrom [1] .

{"text":"We present the set of equations describing the process of transient enhanced diffusion (TED) in shallow implanted layers, which is important to understand and control dopant profiles during semiconductor device fabrication.  The model takes into account both the effects of lattice damage on TED as well as the effect of interstitials generated by the implantation itself. We show that this simple model can explain many experimental observations including the dependence of TED on dose rate, annealing temperature, and annealing time. Finally we use our model to predict the evolution of the dopant profile under different annealing conditions. Transient enhanced diffusion (TED), i.e., the redistribution of dopants after high energy implantation followed by rapid thermal annealing (RTA), has been studied extensively over the past two decades [1] . It is now widely accepted that the main driving force behind TED are point defects created by the implantation [2] , although other mechanisms such as vacancy clustering may also play an important role [3] .\nThe most commonly used models for simulating TED assume that all excess interstitials produced by the implantation are immobile at room temperature [4] . However, recent experiments have shown that some fraction of these interstitials become mobile even before RTA [5] . This mobility leads to additional dopant redistribution [6] . In addition, it was recently found that the amount of interstitials released depends strongly on the implantation dose rate [7, 8] . These results suggest that the current models do not fully capture the physics underlying TED."}

The ground state phase diagram obtained shows that there are three phases; antiferromagnetic insulator, d-wave superconductor, and ferromagnetically ordered metal. In particular we find that the d-wave superconducting region becomes larger as U increases.

{"text":"We propose an improved metric on the space of worldsheet sigma model couplings that is suitable to study gradient renormalization group flows beyond first order in perturbation theory. The new metric has several advantages over previous proposals, including manifestly positive kinetic terms and no need for additional counterterms at higher orders. We show how this metric can be used to compute beta functions up to third order in perturbation theory using only Feynman diagrams with one-loop vacuum bubbles as building blocks. This allows us to obtain results for the beta function of the dilaton coupling to the Ricci scalar which are consistent with those obtained by other methods but have not been previously available due to technical difficulties. In addition we find evidence for non-trivial fixed points in the beta function of the string coupling constant. These results provide further support for the idea that the worldsheet sigma model may serve as a useful tool for studying quantum gravity. Introduction: It was recently shown [1] that the worldsheet sigma-model (WSSM) provides a powerful framework for investigating quantum gravity via its connection to the gravitational path integral [2] . One particularly interesting aspect of this approach is the possibility of computing perturbative corrections to the WSSM action directly from the gravitational path integral without having to resort to explicit calculations involving gravitons or graviton loops [3] .\nIn [4] it was proposed that the WSSM could also be used to investigate the flow of the effective action under the renormalization group (RG). However, since the WSSM contains infinitely many degrees of freedom there does not exist any finite dimensional parameter space where the RG flow takes place. Instead, the RG flow must take place along some infinite-dimensional trajectory through the space of all possible actions. To make progress towards understanding such trajectories it would be helpful if one were able to define a sensible metric on the space of WSSM actions so that distances between different actions could be measured. Such a metric should allow one to determine whether two given actions lie close together or far apart in the space of all possible WSSMs."}
{"text":"The vibrational infrared lifetime (VIL) of N2O dissolved in water is measured by using an optical parametric oscillator pumped with a Nd3+-doped YAG laser at 1064 nm and detecting the emission signal at 1270 nm, which corresponds to the fundamental vibration mode of N2O. The VIL value obtained for pure water is 1.6 \u00b1 0.1 \u03bcs. This result agrees well with that reported previously. \n \n For solutions containing various concentrations of NaCl or KCl, the VIL values are found to be independent of salt concentration within experimental error. These results suggest that the vibrational relaxation process of N2O molecules in aqueous solution does not involve any specific interaction between N2O and ions such as Cl-. It should also be noted that the present measurement was performed under conditions where the solute-solvent interactions were negligible compared to those observed in concentrated solutions. Therefore, it can be concluded that the vibrational relaxation mechanism of N2O in dilute solutions is essentially identical to that in pure water."}

As applications, we show that the corresponding Dirichlet-to-Neumann map satisfies the Shapiro-Lopatinskii condition at all points of its domain of definition and that it has a meromorphic extension into the whole complex plane which can be written as a sum of two terms, one being holomorphic near zero while the other behaves like $1\/z$ when $z \\to 0$.

This concept allows us to define a natural hierarchy among the nodes of our network. In particular, we prove that if there exists a polynomial time algorithm for finding shortest paths between two given nodes then there must exist another polynomial time algorithm for solving the same problem but restricted only to pairs of nodes whose distance belongs to a certain range.

We find that the phase diagram is very rich, including three ordered phases (two nematic-like and one smectic-like) as well as disordered phases at high temperatures or low densities. The nature of the transitions depends strongly on the aspect ratio of the particles. For small aspect ratios we observe first-order transitions to both nematic-like phases; these are replaced by continuous transitions when increasing the aspect ratio. In addition, there exists an intermediate region where no stable ordered state can be found. This region becomes smaller upon decreasing temperature but increases again if density fluctuations are suppressed.

Anisotropy may arise due to shape effects [2] , magnetic interactions [3] , or electric dipole moments [4] .\nIn this work we consider systems consisting of elongated particles which interact via hard-core repulsion only. Such models have attracted considerable interest recently because they provide simple descriptions of complex fluid phenomena such as liquid crystal formation [5] . Moreover, it was shown experimentally [6] and theoretically [7, 8] that hard rods exhibit interesting glass-forming properties similar to those observed in molecular liquids [9] . A further motivation comes from recent studies of colloid-polymer mixtures [10] : It turns out that the effective interaction potential between the colloids is often dominated by repulsive contributions arising from excluded volume effects [11] .

At higher energies new phenomena may appear beyond those predicted by the SM [3] .\nIn order to describe such effects one usually considers extensions of the SM [4] or models based on effective theories [5] . Effective theories provide a systematic way to include corrections due to physics at scales above the energy scale considered [6] . They allow us to calculate observables using perturbative techniques even when the underlying dynamics cannot be described within the framework of standard quantum mechanics [7, 8] . This approach is particularly useful in cases where there exists no fundamental description of the physical system under consideration [9] .\nOne example of an effective theory is Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), the theory of strong interactions [10] . It predicts the existence of hadrons made of quarks and gluons [11] . However, since the typical momentum transfer inside a hadron is much smaller than the characteristic scale of QCD processes [12] , the latter can be studied separately from the former [13] .

{"text":"We report on the experimental demonstration of frequency upshift in two colliding laser pulses using a relativistically flying mirror (RFM). The RFM is realized as an ultrathin foil accelerated to high velocities by intense femtosecond laser pulses focused onto it at grazing incidence angle. We show that the collision between the counter-propagating laser pulses leads to the generation of new frequencies, which are shifted towards higher values compared to those generated without the presence of the RFM. This effect can be explained within the framework of nonlinear optics and quantum electrodynamics. Our results demonstrate the possibility for generating high-energy photons via collisions of laser pulses in vacuum. These findings may have important implications for future applications such as particle acceleration or gamma-ray sources based on table-top experiments. \n \n In recent years there has been growing interest in studying the interaction of ultra-intense lasers with matter under extreme conditions [1] . One particular area of research focuses on the investigation of novel phenomena associated with the propagation of light in vacuum [2] , where the effects of strong field QED [3] become relevant [4] . For example, the emission of energetic electrons [5] and positrons [6] into vacuum was observed experimentally [7-9] when intense laser pulses were focused onto thin foils [10] .

This allowed us to determine when the Moon was most likely to be bombarded with high energy particles. In addition we calculated the total number of times that C1 crossed the Moon's bow shock during its lifetime.

{"text":"We have studied the dependence of growth rates for collisionless magnetic instabilities (CMIs) in nonrelativistic electron-ion plasmas with Maxwellian velocity distributions, using linear kinetic theory. We found that the growth rate is strongly dependent upon the shape of the distribution function at high velocities. In particular, we find that the fastest growing mode has its maximum growth rate when the distribution function peaks near the speed of light. This result suggests that CMIs may be excited more easily than previously thought under certain conditions. \n \n The effect of solitary waves on the growth rates was also investigated numerically. It was shown that the presence of solitary waves can significantly enhance or suppress the growth rates depending on their amplitudes relative to those of background fluctuations.

They should therefore provide useful information about the evolution of unstable plasma systems."}

{"text":"The spin current is the key concept for understanding and manipulating magnetism at nanoscale, which has been widely studied both experimentally and theoretically.  In this work we study the spin current through an interface between two ferromagnetic layers with different coercive fields by using the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation combined with the Slonczewski spin-transfer torque term. We find that there exists a critical field difference beyond which no steady state solution can be found. The results are consistent with previous experimental observations. This suggests that the spin current may play important roles on the switching process of magnetic multilayers. Spintronics is one of the most active research areas in condensed matter physics today [1-3]. It deals with the manipulation of electron spins instead of charge carriers to achieve novel electronic devices such as spin transistors [4] , spin logic gates [5] , etc.. One of its central concepts is the spin current [6] . A spin current is defined as the flow of angular momentum carried by electrons or holes [7-9]. Recently it was shown that the spin current plays crucial role in the switching processes of magnetic multilayers [10-12]. For example, when a spin-polarized current passes through a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ), the injected spin current will exert a torque on the local magnetization due to the so-called spin-transfer effect [13] . If the applied voltage across the MTJ exceeds some threshold value, then the total torque exerted on the local magnetization becomes larger than the damping force so that the magnetization switches direction [14-16]. However, if the applied voltage is not large enough, the magnetization cannot switch even though the spin current keeps flowing [17] .\nIn order to understand how the spin current affects the switching behavior of magnetic multilayers, many theoretical studies have been performed recently [18-21]. Most of these works focus on studying the dynamics of the magnetization under external electric field [22, 23] . Very little attention has been paid to the effects of the spin current itself on the switching behaviors [24] ."}
{"text":"The electrostatic interactions between two asymmetrically charged membranes are studied by using the mean-field theory and Monte Carlo simulations. The results show that there is an attractive interaction between these membranes, which can be explained as follows. When one membrane approaches another with opposite charges on their surfaces, it will induce a dipole moment in its neighbor due to charge redistribution at the interface. This induced dipole moment causes an additional attraction between them. In addition, we find that this effect becomes more pronounced when the dielectric constant of water decreases. Finally, our study shows that the magnitude of the electrostatic force depends strongly on the surface charge density difference between the two membranes. We also discuss how the electrostatic forces affect the phase behavior of lipid bilayers. DOI: 10.1063\/1.3189000\nI. INTRODUCTIO N\nIn recent years, many studies have been carried out on the properties of biomembranes [1] . It has been found that the physical characteristics of biological systems such as cell adhesion [2] , vesicle fusion [3] , protein folding [4] , etc., depend crucially on the structure and composition of the underlying lipid bilayer [5] .\nBiological membranes consist mainly of phospholipids [6] . These lipids contain hydrophobic tails and hydrophilic heads [7, 8] . Due to the amphiphilicity of phospholipids, they tend to self-assemble into bilayers [9] . A typical example for such a system is shown schematically in Fig.  1(a) . Each layer consists of a monolayer of phospholipids arranged in a fluid-like state [10] . The thickness of each layer is about 5 nm [11] . The head groups point towards the aqueous solution while the tail groups face away from it [12] . Because of the presence of water molecules inside the layers, the effective dielectric constant of the medium is high (about 80) [13] . However, outside the layers, where only air exists, the dielectric constant is low (about 1). Therefore, the electric field lines penetrate easily through the interior region but not so much through the exterior region [14] ."}
{"text":"We present an analysis of the observed properties of the rare, hot (T eff > 20 000 K), helium-rich subdwarf B (sdB) and extreme horizontal branch (EHB) stars in globular clusters that are known as red stragglers or blue hook stars.  We show how these objects can be explained by the merger of two helium white dwarfs with total mass exceeding the Chandrasekhar limit.   The resulting merged object is expected to have a radius larger than its Roche lobe at all stages during the merging process, which leads to stable mass transfer onto the companion star until it fills its Roche lobe and starts overflowing.   This results in a common envelope phase where most of the orbital energy released is used to eject the outer layers of both stars into space.   After this stage, the system consists of a naked helium core surrounded by a thin hydrogen layer on top of the helium core.   If the initial masses of the progenitor white dwarf components were close enough together such that their cores merge before they reach the Chandrasekhar mass, then we expect the final product to resemble a normal sdB star; if not, then the final product will be more massive than the Chandrasekhar"}
{"text":"We test whether the observed value of lambda is consistent with the prediction that it should be equal to one third of the square root of the number density of galaxies in the universe today, as suggested by Tegmark et al. (2006) . We find no evidence against this hypothesis using data on galaxy luminosity functions at redshifts z = 0.1, 1.0 and 3.5 taken from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The predicted values are obtained assuming that the dark energy equation-of-state parameter w is constant over time. This assumption may not hold if there exists an interaction between dark matter and dark energy. However, we show that even allowing w to vary significantly does not affect our results. \n \n In addition, we use the WMAP 5-year cosmological parameters to calculate the expected temperature anisotropy power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) given the current best-fit model. We compare these theoretical predictions with measurements made by the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP), finding good agreement across all multipole moments up to lmax = 1000."}
{"text":"The development and evolution of vascular networks in leaves is driven by the need to transport water efficiently, but how this process occurs remains poorly understood. Here we show that mechanical forces play an important role during vein formation through their effects on cell division orientation. We use computational models based on experimental data to demonstrate that veins form perpendicularly with respect to the direction of maximum principal stress (MPS), which coincides with the direction of growth at early stages of leaf development. The MPS also determines where new veins will emerge laterally along existing ones. Our results suggest that veins are formed as a result of anisotropic cell divisions induced by localised tensile stresses generated by differential growth between neighbouring cells. This mechanism provides a simple explanation for why veins tend to be oriented perpendicularly to the direction of growth. Vein patterning has been studied extensively over recent years because it plays such an important role in plant function [1] . In particular, the arrangement of veins within a leaf influences its ability to transport water [2] , so understanding how they develop may help us improve crop yields [3] .\nVeins can be classified into two main types: major veins, which run longitudinally down the centre of the lamina; and minor veins, which branch out from them towards the edges [4] . Major veins typically have larger diameters than minor veins [5] , and are composed of several layers of xylem vessels surrounded by phloem [6] . Minor veins consist only of one or two layers of parenchyma cells [7, 8] . Both types of vein contain living tissue called mesophyll [9] ."}
{"text":"We study the structure of the stationary distribution for an asymmetric version of the Target Process (TP). The TP is a continuous-time Markov chain on the integers, which has been introduced by Aldous and Pitman in their seminal work [1] . It can be seen as a model for the evolution of a population with immigration and emigration at fixed rates. In this article we consider a generalization where individuals are allowed to emigrate only if they have reached some threshold value k \u2208 N 0 , i.e., the number of immigrants per unit time decreases linearly when the current size of the population increases beyond k. We show that under mild conditions there exists a unique stationary distribution \u03c0 = (\u03c0(n)) n\u2208N0 such that \u03c0(k) > 0 holds true. Moreover, we prove that \u03c0 satisfies a recursion formula similar to the one obtained for the original TP. Finally, we provide explicit expressions for \u03c0(1), ..., \u03c0(k+1).\nKeywords: Asymmetric target process, Stationary distribution"}
{"text":"We present an analysis of the distribution of planetary orbital parameters and masses for all known extrasolar planets with measured mass (N=73). We find that this sample can be divided into three distinct groups, which we call super-Earths, mini-Neptunes, and hot Jupiters. The first two are characterized by low eccentricities and high mutual inclinations between their orbits; in contrast, hot Jupiters have small mutual inclinations but large eccentricities. Super-Earths and mini-Neptunes also appear to form separate sequences on the radius-mass diagram. These results suggest that these three populations may represent different formation mechanisms or evolutionary histories. In particular, our findings support previous suggestions that super-Earths formed via core accretion followed by significant inward migration while mini-Neptunes were likely assembled through gravitational instability. Finally, we show how these results can be used as priors when searching for additional exoplanets using transit surveys such as Kepler."}
{"text":"The folding pathways of proteins are complex networks that can be represented by graphs, where nodes represent the conformations and edges connect pairs of neighboring states in sequence space.  The number of possible paths through this network is enormous; however, it has been shown that only a small fraction of these actually occur during protein folding experiments.   In order to understand how proteins fold into their native state we need to determine which parts of the network are most important for folding.    Herein, we use an information theoretic approach based on Shannon entropy to identify key residues involved in folding processes using experimental data obtained from single molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) measurements performed at different temperatures.  We show that our method identifies amino acids with known roles in protein folding as well as new candidates for further investigation. Proteins fold along specific pathways in conformation space, but the complexity of the process makes it difficult to predict the exact pathway taken by any given protein. To better understand the mechanisms underlying protein folding, researchers have developed computational models that attempt to capture the essential features of the folding process. These models typically consist of a graph whose vertices correspond to distinct conformational states and whose edges link adjacent states in sequence space1\u20133 . However, even though such models provide useful insights about the general behavior of proteins, they cannot fully describe all details of the folding process because there exist many more possible sequences than experimentally observed ones4\u20136 . Therefore, identifying those regions of the model that play crucial roles in determining the final folded structure remains one of the main challenges in understanding the physical principles behind protein folding7\u201310 ."}
{"text":"We present new near-infrared (NIR) observations and modeling results for the young stellar object, Barnard 68 (B68). The NIR data were obtained with the Gemini Near-Infrared Spectrograph on the 8-meter Gemini North telescope in Hawaii during two nights in December 2005. We used these data to construct an SED model that includes both photospheric emission and dust continuum emission. Our best-fit model suggests that B68 is surrounded by a dense core with a mass of 0.1 M_solar_(M_solar = 1.99 x 10^30 kg), which has been heated up to about 100 K due to the central star's radiation. This temperature corresponds to a luminosity of 3 L_sun_(L_sun = 3.84 x 10^26 W).

{"text":"We present new observations at 5 GHz and 8.4 GHz with the VLA in A-configuration, which reveal that the nuclear region of the Seyfert 1.5 galaxy NGC5033 is dominated by two compact components separated by ~0.3 arcsec (~500 pc). The northern component has an inverted spectrum between 5-8.4GHz while the southern one shows a steep spectral index consistent with optically-thin synchrotron radiation. We find no evidence for extended emission on scales larger than 0.1 arcsec (100pc) around either source. These results are discussed within the context of models where relativistic jets interact strongly with their environment to produce shocks and particle acceleration. In this scenario we propose that the northern component may be associated with a young jet emerging from the nucleus, whereas the southern one could represent older material ejected earlier during the activity cycle of the AGN. \n \n Keywords: Radio galaxies"}
{"text":"We study the phenomenology of non-zero trilinear soft supersymmetry breaking (SSB) term A 0 in minimal supergravity (mSUGRA). We find that for large values of tan \u03b2, there is an upper bound on |A 0 | which can be obtained by requiring correct electroweak symmetry breaking. For small values of tan \u03b2, we show that the allowed range of |A 0 | increases with decreasing value of M 1\/2 . In both cases, the lower limit on |A 0 | comes from the requirement of not having charge and\/or color breaking minima deeper than the electroweak vacuum. The effect of varying |A 0 | on sparticle masses are studied numerically using ISAJET 7.64. It is found that increasing |A 0 | leads to decrease in mass difference between lightest neutralino and lighter charginos as well as increase in mass splitting among squarks and sleptons. This results into enhancement of production cross sections of these particles at hadronic colliders like Tevatron and LHC."}

{"text":"We present an analysis of the recently introduced concept of channel capacity in terms of accessible information, which is based on the notion of mutual entropy and can be computed by means of semidefinite programming (SDP). We show that this approach leads to upper bounds on the classical capacity of arbitrary quantum channels with finite-dimensional input and output spaces. In particular we prove that these bounds are tight if the channel has full rank or its complementary channel does not have any nontrivial invariant subspace. Furthermore, we demonstrate how our results can be used to derive lower bounds on the entanglement-assisted classical capacity of quantum channels. Finally, we discuss some open problems related to the presented work. Quantum communication over noisy channels requires encoding messages into states of high fidelity before transmission through the channel. The amount of information transmitted per use of such a channel depends crucially on the properties of the latter. For example, it was shown that there exist quantum channels whose capacities cannot exceed one bit per qubit [1] . This fact implies that even though the state space of a single qubit is two-dimensional, only very little information can be encoded into it without error correction. On the other hand, it turns out that certain classes of quantum channels allow for reliable transmission of more than one bit of information per qubit [2] .\nIn order to quantify the performance of a given quantum channel N , one usually considers two different types of capacities [3] : First, the classical capacity C(N ) measures the maximum rate at which classical information can be reliably communicated using N as a resource. Second, the quantum capacity Q(N ) describes the highest possible rate at which quantum information can be sent through N while preserving its quantum nature. It should be noted that both quantities depend on the choice of the underlying physical resources like energy or time [4] ."}
{"text":"We study the relic density of dark matter (DM) produced by thermal freeze-out and freezein processes in Universal Extra Dimension (UED) model, where we include effects due to Majorana mass terms for the right handed neutrino fields. We find that the DM can be either fermionic or bosonic depending on the values of the parameters involved. In particular, if the UED scale is close to 1 TeV then the DM candidate could be a scalar particle which has been recently proposed as a possible explanation for the PAMELA positron excess observed at high energies. The results are presented in the context of LHC searches for new physics beyond Standard Model. Introduction:-The discovery of the Higgs-like resonance [1-3] at Large Hadron Collider (LHC), alongwith other experimental evidences [4] , have established the existence of a fundamental scalar field responsible for breaking electroweak symmetry. However, there still remain many open questions about the nature of this scalar sector such as: What is its spin? Is it CP-even or odd? Does it couple only to gauge bosons or also to fermions? Are there any additional scalars present in Nature ? These issues will be addressed once more data becomes available from ongoing experiments like ATLAS [5] and CMS [6] . On the theoretical front, one of the most interesting possibilities is to consider extensions of the Standard Model (SM). One possibility is to extend SM into higher dimensions [7-9], thereby introducing Kaluza-Klein excitations of all particles [10] .\nIn recent years, several authors [11-13] studied the phenomenology of these theories in detail. It was shown that the lightest KaluzaKlein excitation of the graviton may act as cold Dark Matter (CDM) [14-16]. This scenario is particularly appealing since CDM constitutes around 23% [17] of the energy content of our universe [18] . Moreover, the presence of an extra spatial dimension opens up the possibility of producing Kaluza-Klein states through various production mechanisms [19-21] including decay [22] and annihilation [23] . Recently, it has been pointed out [24]"}
{"text":"We study the stability of spin-1\/2 fermions confined to one dimension by an external potential and interacting via contact interactions, using the Bethe ansatz solution for the Lieb-Liniger model. We find that there is no instability at zero temperature when the chemical potential lies between two consecutive energy levels of the system. This result holds true even if we consider finite temperatures as well. In particular, this implies that the ground state remains stable against collapse into a single particle state (fermionization) or formation of bound states with more than 2 particles (bosonization). The results are also valid for higher spins. Our analysis can be extended to other models such as those describing cold atoms trapped inside optical lattices. Introduction:-In recent years, ultracold atomic systems have been used extensively to simulate various physical phenomena [1] . One-dimensional quantum gases provide particularly interesting examples because they allow us to explore many-body physics in regimes where analytical solutions cannot be obtained [2] .\nThe most common experimental setup consists of confining bosonic or fermionic atoms along one spatial direction within a harmonic trap [3] , which leads to the emergence of quasi-one dimensional behavior [4] . However, it has recently become possible to confine these atoms tightly enough so that their motion becomes truly onedimensional [5] . For example, experiments performed with Bose-Einstein condensates [6] and degenerate Fermi gases [7, 8] show that confinement in a narrow channel gives rise to new phases of matter [9] . These include superfluidity [10] , supersolids [11] , Luttinger liquids [12] , Tonks-Girardeau gas [13] , and Mott insulators [14] . It would therefore be very useful to develop theoretical tools capable of predicting the properties of these novel phases [15] .\nOne of the main challenges associated with studying strongly correlated quantum systems is determining whether certain configurations are energetically favorable [16] . If the answer turns out to be yes, then we say that the configuration is metastable [17] . On the other hand, if the answer is no, then the configuration is unstable [18] . Instabilities may occur due to spontaneous symmetry"}
{"text":"We present new optical and ultraviolet (UV) spectra for the intrinsically X-ray weak quasar PHL 1811, obtained with the Keck Observatory's HIRES spectrograph in 1998-99. The data cover wavelengths between 3200 A and 10400\u00c5 at resolution R = \u03bb\/\u2206\u03bb \u2248 45000. We find that the continuum emission is well described by an accretion disk model with parameters similar to those found previously for other quasars. However, we detect no broad absorption lines or narrow absorption features associated with outflows. In addition, there are several unusual properties of the line profiles which suggest that this object may be different than most quasars studied so far. \n \n Keywords: Quasars; Broad Absorption Lines; Accretion Disk Modeling. 1 Introduction \n \n PHL 1811 was discovered as part of the Palomar-Green survey (Schmidt & Green 1983 ) and has been observed extensively since then. It is one of only two known examples of an X-ray weak quasar (Wilkes et al. 1994) , where the ratio of its soft X-ray flux density to its 2500 \u00c5 flux density is less than 0.1. Wilkes et al. (1994) suggested that it might have a high column density absorber along our line-of-sight, but subsequent observations failed to confirm this hypothesis (e.g., Mathur et al. 1995) . Instead, they concluded that the source must be intrinsically X-ray weak because of some unknown mechanism. Recent Chandra observations show that the spectrum below 2 keV can be fitted reasonably well using a power law plus Galactic absorption (Mathur et al. 2002 ) . This suggests that the intrinsic X-ray weakness could arise due to a steep spectral index rather than strong obscuration. Another possibility is that the X-rays are absorbed by ionized gas near the central black hole . \n \n PHL 1811 also shows interesting variability on time scales ranging from hours to years. For example, Wilkes et al. (1995) reported rapid changes in both the hardness ratios and luminosity during their ASCA observation. They interpreted these variations as being caused by partial"}
{"text":"We study spin-1\/2 fermions on an infinite square lattice with nearest-neighbor hopping and pairing interactions, using exact diagonalization techniques to calculate their ground-state energy as well as the momentum distribution function at zero temperature.  We find that for weak coupling (small values of t\/J), the system is in a superfluid phase characterized by off-diagonal long-range order; however, this state becomes unstable when t\/J exceeds some critical value tc(\u03bc) which depends on chemical potential \u03bc. For strong coupling (large values of t\/J), we show that there exists another stable phase where the system has no off-diagonal long range order but still exhibits gapless excitations. This new phase can be viewed as a BCS-like paired state without any broken symmetry. The transition between these two phases occurs via a quantum phase transition.

The workspace is then defined as the set of all poses reachable by such chains when they are connected to any possible end-effector pose. This definition allows us to use tools developed for serial robots to analyze parallel manipulators. In particular, we prove that the workspace boundary consists of two types of surfaces: singularity surfaces corresponding to configurations where one or more joint velocities become zero; and self-motion surfaces corresponding to configurations where the robot's motion becomes indeterminate because it has multiple solutions.

{"text":"We investigate whether we can detect anisotropy in quasar H II regions during reionization through their small-scale redshifted 21 cm power spectrum (21-cm PS). In our model, quasars are assumed to be located at peaks of dark matter density fluctuations and ionize surrounding gas with an anisotropic Str\u00f6mgren sphere whose shape is determined by the local tidal field. By performing numerical simulations for different values of the spin temperature T S , we find that the 21-cm PS has a characteristic peak structure which reflects the shapes of individual H II regions. This peak structure becomes more prominent as T S decreases because the number of neutral hydrogen atoms increases due to the decrease in the brightness temperature difference between the CMB and the 21-cm emission line. Our results suggest that it may be possible to use this peak structure to constrain the value of T S . However, since there exist many other factors affecting the 21-cm PS besides T S , further studies will be needed before drawing any conclusions on its detectability."}

The latter are related to each other via T-duality transformations. Finally, we give an explicit example for such a configuration involving two stacks of coincident D3-branes at angles. This is done using the technique developed recently by Sen. We find agreement between our results and those derived previously within supergravity approximation. N = 1 supersymmetry is broken down to N = 0 when one wraps D-branes around supersymmetry breaking cycles [1] . These configurations have been studied extensively over the past few years [2] - [8] .\nIn this letter we will consider non-supersymmetric brane-antibrane configurations in type-IIA string theory [9] , where both branes wrap supersymmetry breaking cycles. Such configurations were first discussed in [10] . They correspond to bound states of intersecting D4-branes wrapped on 2-cycles [11] or NS5-branes [12] . It was shown in [13] that they can be described alternatively as bound states of intersected NS5-branes with O6 planes [14] .

{"text":"We study how distortions in the OORT cloud affect the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies, and find that they can be constrained by future experiments such as Planck satellite.  We show that if there is no distortion in the OORT cloud then it will not produce any effect on the CMB temperature fluctuations at large angular scales. However, if there are distortions present in the OORT cloud, then these would lead to additional contributions to the CMB temperature fluctuations which could potentially be detected with high precision using upcoming experiments like Planck satellite. The main goal of this work is to investigate whether or not we should expect some level of distortion in the OORT clouds due to gravitational effects produced during the formation of large-scale structures in our universe. If yes, then one may also ask what kind of constraints do current observations put on possible distortions? In order to answer these questions, we first calculate the amount of energy density associated with the OORT cloud. Then, assuming that all the mass in the OORT cloud was originally located near the center of the solar system, we estimate its contribution to the total matter density parameter $\\Omega_m$ today. Finally, we use the WMAP5 data to constrain the allowed range for the distortion parameters."}
{"text":"We present an analysis of high-resolution near-infrared images obtained with NACO\/VLT and SPHERE\/ZIMPOL\/ESO to study the photometric variability of the exoplanet HD 189733b in its transit across the stellar disk. We find that the planet's brightness varies by more than one magnitude between phases 0.8-0.9, which is consistent with previous results based on lower resolution data. The observed phase curve shows two maxima at phases 0.85 and 0.95, indicating that the planet has a strong east-west temperature gradient. This result can be explained if we assume that the planet orbits close to edge-on (i = 85\u00b0) and that it receives most of its energy from the star through a single hemisphere. In this case, the planet would have a large day\/night temperature difference of about 1000 K. Our observations also show evidence for a small hot spot located near the substellar point."}
{"text":"We study the decoherence dynamics of an open quantum system consisting of two-level atoms coupled to a single-mode cavity field in presence of dissipation and driving fields. The atom-cavity coupling is treated within the framework of Jaynes-Cummings model, while the dissipative effects are described by using the master equation for the reduced density matrix of the system. We show that the steady state solution of this problem can be obtained analytically when the decay rates of all atomic levels are equal. In particular we find that the steady-state entanglement between the atom-field subsystem depends on both the strength of the external driving field as well as the number of excited states involved in the process. Finally, we discuss how our results could be used to explain recent experimental observations concerning the generation of nonclassical light via spontaneous emission processes.

This fact was confirmed later on by numerous observational data [3] . However, it remains unclear what causes this phenomenon. One possible explanation could be related to some new physics beyond general relativity [4] .\n \nIn order to study the possibility of such phenomena within the framework of classical general relativity one needs to impose certain restrictions on the properties of matter fields present in the theory. These restrictions are usually called \"energy conditions\" [5] . They were introduced originally as mathematical assumptions needed to prove various theorems about singularities [6] or black holes [7] . Later they became widely used also in other branches of theoretical physics [8] - [11] . For example, they play important role in studying inflationary models [12] - [14] . \n \n 2 Energy Conditions in Cosmology \n \n Let us start our discussion with the following set of four basic energy conditions [15] :"}

{"text":"We present the results of an analysis of the mass assembly history of spheroidal galaxies in the Millennium Simulation, which is based on semi-analytic models for galaxy formation and evolution. We find that major mergers are not required to explain the observed properties of these systems at z < 1.5. The majority of massive (M* > 1010 h-1 Msun) spheroids assembled their stellar masses by z = 2 via minor mergers with other massive spheroids or gas-rich disk galaxies. This process was accompanied by rapid growth in size due to dissipationless merging. At lower redshifts, most of this growth continued through minor mergers but also included significant amounts of star formation driven by cold flows into the central regions of the system. Our results suggest that the progenitors of local elliptical galaxies were already well-established by z ~ 3 as compact spheroids containing old stars."}
{"text":"We report the discovery of a new isolated neutron star (INS) candidate, PSR J1852+0040, in the southern hemisphere using data collected by the Parkes radio telescope and the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA). The pulsar was discovered during a search for millisecond pulsars with high proper motions. It has a spin period P = 1.4 ms and is located at a distance D = 3 kpc. Its dispersion measure DM = 0.6 pc cm-3 implies that it lies behind most of the galactic disk but not far enough to be associated with any known supernova remnant or open cluster. We have also detected its X-ray counterpart in archival Chandra observations. This source appears point-like and shows no evidence of extended emission. Based on these properties we conclude that this object is likely to be a young INS. If confirmed as such, our results will provide important constraints on models of pulsar formation and evolution. \n \n Keywords: Neutron stars"}
{"text":"We present an analysis of user attention to tags and resources in collaborative tagging communities, based on the data collected by Delicious.com over three years (2005-2007). We find that users' attention is highly skewed towards popular tags and resources; only about 0.1% of all tags are ever used more than once, while less than 1% of all resources receive more than one bookmark. The distribution of user attention follows Zipf's law for both tags and resources. In addition, we show how this skewness can be explained by two factors: 1) the popularity bias -the fact that most users tend to use tags or resources which they have seen before- and 2) the social influence -the tendency of people to follow others who share their interests. Finally, we propose several metrics to measure user attention, including novel measures such as the number of distinct users who bookmarked each resource\/tag at least once during our observation period."}

The correlation between the break time and E p can be explained if the break occurs when the fireball becomes transparent at its photosphere radius.

{"text":"In this work, we study angles between infinite dimensional subspaces in Hilbert spaces. We first introduce an angle measure for two closed linear operators on Hilbert spaces which is based on their resolvent kernels. Then we show that if one operator is compact then the angle measure coincides with the usual cosine of the angle between the range space of these operators. Finally, as applications of our results, we give some new characterizations of the convergence rate of the Rayleigh-Ritz method and the alternating projectors methods. The proofs are given by using the concept of angle measures introduced here. In particular, it turns out that the convergence rates of both methods depend only on the angles between the corresponding subspaces involved but not on any other properties such as dimensions or norms of those subspaces. This fact has been observed numerically before but never proved rigorously until now. It should be noted that all results presented here hold true also when the underlying Hilbert spaces are Banach spaces instead of just Hilbert spaces."}

{"text":"We study the evolution of matter density fluctuations in two classes of scalar-tensor theories, f(R)-gravity and Brans-Dicke theory with varying coupling parameter $\\chi$. We show that for both these cases there is an additional contribution to the growth factor which depends on the background value of the scalar field $\\phi_0$ as well as its time derivative ${\\dot \\phi}_0$. This extra term can be significant at late times when the background scalar field has evolved significantly.  In particular we find that this effect leads to a suppression of structure formation compared to standard general relativity (GR). The magnitude of this effect increases with decreasing values of the coupling parameter $\\chi$ or increasing values of the function $f(R)$. For example, if one considers the model $R_0 = 10^{-22} \\rm{m}^2$ then the difference between GR predictions and those obtained using our formalism becomes noticeable only after $z < 0.5$ while for $R_0 = 10^{-20}$ it appears already around $z = 1$. \nThe results presented here are relevant not only for cosmological applications but also for studies of local dynamics within galaxies where they may affect estimates of the mass-to-light ratio."}

Our results hold both in terms of worst-case performance guarantees as well as average case behavior under realistic assumptions about access patterns.

The layout problem is formulated as an optimization problem: given a set of objects that need to be stored in memory, we want to find their positions so that they can be accessed most efficiently by future queries. In this work, we consider the following scenario: A large amount of data needs to be stored in main memory (e.g., a database). This data consists of many small objects (e.g., records) whose sizes vary greatly; some may even be larger than available space. To solve this problem, one could use a standard technique called blocking: each object is divided into blocks of equal size, and then these blocks are placed contiguously within the allocated storage area. However, if there are too few blocks per object, it will not fit entirely inside its assigned block; similarly, if there are too many blocks per object, the unused space between them cannot be used effectively."}

The light curve shows two distinct flaring episodes separated by about one month; we find that these are well described as exponential rise\/decay profiles with decay timescales of ~10 days each. We compare this behavior to that observed for another black hole microquasar, XTE J1550- 564, whose outbursts were also monitored extensively by RXTE. In particular, we show that the first flare is very similar to the second flare seen in XTE J1550-564: both have comparable durations, luminosities, and spectral shapes at their peaks. However, there are some differences between them: while the second flare decays more slowly than the first flare, it has a much lower luminosity when compared to the first flare."}

A new method based on the concept of virtual joints is developed to calculate the mass distribution along each leg of the PKMT under consideration. This information can be used as an input data set for further dynamic analyses such as modal or harmonic vibration analysis. Finally, two different PKMTs with three degrees-of-freedom per joint are designed and analyzed using the proposed methodology. It was found that the first PKMT exhibits better dynamic characteristics than its counterpart due to its lower natural frequencies and higher damping ratios."}

We solve this equation using a recently developed scheme that allows us to treat large supercells with high accuracy. In order to account for nonadiabatic corrections we introduce a self-consistent treatment of electronic screening into our approach. This enables us to calculate accurate phonon dispersions at arbitrary points in reciprocal space without any additional computational effort compared to standard DFT calculations.

{"text":"We study the evolution of magnetized, rotating flows in the presence of strong magnetic fields and rotation using 3D numerical simulations with ideal MHD equations. We find that when the initial flow is dominated by toroidal field lines (Btor\/Bp = 0.5), it becomes unstable to non-axisymmetric perturbations at t ~ 1.2P0\/c where P0 is the initial pressure scale height. The instability leads to the formation of helical structures which are similar to those observed in many astrophysical systems such as protostellar disks or AGN accretion disks. In addition we also observe another type of instability for initially poloidal-dominated flows (Btor\/Bp < 0.1) which develops into an axisymmetric spiral structure. This instability can be understood as a Rossby wave instability driven by differential rotation between the disk and the corona.

In addition, it was found that the growth rate of firm size follows Gibrat's Law while that of profitability does not.

INTRODUCTORY REMARK\nThe critical Casimir effect [1] , i.e., the force acting between macroscopic bodies due to fluctuations of the order parameter near their phase transitions, has been studied extensively during recent years both theoretically [2] - [4] and experimentally [5] . It was shown [6] that this effect may play important role in various physical phenomena such as capillary condensation [7, 8] or wetting [9] .\nIn particular, the critical Casimir effect plays crucial role in the physics of thin liquid helium films [10] where it leads to the appearance of additional forces [11] responsible for the formation of stable droplets [12] . These effects have been observed recently [13] in experiments performed on helium nanodroplets trapped inside magnetic traps [14] . However, most theoretical studies so far were restricted to idealized situations neglecting the influence of the substrate [15] - [17] . This simplification is justified only if the thickness of the film d is much larger than the range of interaction potential between atoms of the fluid and the surface [18] . For example, in case of 4 He films adsorbed on graphite substrates [19] the typical values of these parameters are [20] : r 0 \u2248 3\u00c5, d \u2248 10 \u2212 100 nm.

{"text":"We study the transmission properties of defects in affine Toda field theories (ATFTs). We show that all ATFTs with simply-laced Lie algebras have only one type of defect, which is transmitted by itself and its images under the action of the Weyl group. This result generalizes previous results for A_n ATFTs to arbitrary ATFTs. In particular we find that the reflection coefficients are given by simple expressions involving the Coxeter number h of the underlying Lie algebra. The analysis presented here can be extended to other integrable models such as supersymmetric extensions or higher rank ATFTs. Defects play an important role in many physical systems ranging from condensed matter physics over particle physics to string theory. They appear when two different phases coexist at some point in space-time. For example they may arise if there exists a domain wall between two regions where the vacuum expectation values of certain fields differ. Another possibility is that defects occur due to impurities in solids or liquids. In this case it has been shown that the effective description of these defects leads to integrable models [1] . Integrability means that the scattering amplitudes factorize into products of two-body S-matrices [2] .\nIn recent years much progress was made on understanding the structure of defects in integrable quantum field theories [3] - [8] .

INTRODUCTORY REMARkS\nThe study of simple model systems has played an important role in understanding many aspects of condensed matter physics [1] .

For example, it was shown recently [9] that the effective interaction between two proteins immersed in water can be accurately described by a hard-core repulsion plus a short-range attraction.

This work demonstrates that broadband microwave techniques can be used as an accurate probe of spin dynamics in strongly correlated systems. In recent years there has been growing interest in understanding how quantum mechanical effects influence macroscopic properties such as transport or magnetism in condensed matter physics [1] . One important example is the study of collective excitations known as magnons which arise due to strong correlations among spins [2] .\nIn order to understand these phenomena it is necessary to measure the response of the system to external perturbations. For instance, one may apply a small oscillating magnetic field h(t), which leads to a precession of the local magnetic moments around their equilibrium positions. If we assume that the applied field is sufficiently weak so that only linear terms contribute to the energy expansion then the resulting change in the total energy E = H0 + H1h(t) yields information about the magnetic susceptibility \u03c71 = dE\/dh1 [3] , where h1 denotes the amplitude of the perturbation.

For small values of these parameters we observe stable orbits which do not lead to any significant changes in the direction of the jets. However, if one or more of them are large enough then the orbit becomes unstable leading to rapid growth of the eccentricity followed by merger within a few hundred million years.

For example, bacterial colonies grown on Petri dishes form circular rings [1] , while fungal colonies grown on agar plates tend to take square or hexagonal forms [2] . These observations have inspired researchers to develop mathematical models describing how these colonies evolve [3, 4, 5, 6, 7] .\nIn this paper we consider one such model proposed by M. Hatzikirion and A. Othmar [8] . It describes the evolution of a two-dimensional array of cells arranged in rows and columns. Each row consists of n identical cells located at positions i = 0, ..., n \u2212 1. At each discrete time step t \u2208 N, every cell has three possible states: quiescent (q), proliferating (p) and dead (d). Quiescent cells do not change their state during the current time step. Proliferating cells divide into two daughter cells after one time step. Dead cells cannot divide further but may become quiescent again. The division process continues until all cells reach the maximum number m of divisions allowed per cell lineage. Then they die out and disappear completely."}
{"text":"The present study examines the role played by information feedbacks on cultural evolution, focusing on how they affect the transmission of culture between generations through social learning mechanisms such as imitation or teaching. We show that when individuals are able to observe their own performance relative to others' performances (i.e., when there is information feedback), this can lead to an increase in cultural diversity at both individual and population levels. In particular, we find that under certain conditions, information feedback may cause cultural traits to become more variable across individuals within each generation, thereby increasing the likelihood for new cultural variants to emerge. This effect occurs because individuals who perform better than average tend to be imitated more often than those who perform worse than average; thus, over time, the distribution of cultural traits becomes skewed towards higher values. Finally, we demonstrate that these results hold true even if individuals have imperfect knowledge about other's performances."}
{"text":"We present results for the evolution of magnetized protostellar accretion discs in which we have included both Ohmic and ambipolar diffusion, as well as radiative transfer effects using flux-limited diffusion (FLD). We find that the inclusion of these additional physical processes has important consequences for disc structure and evolution.  In particular, we show that the presence of an initial magnetic field can significantly affect the mass distribution within the disc at early times by suppressing fragmentation near the central star. This leads to more massive discs than those found previously with purely hydrodynamic simulations. The resulting discs are also less flared due to the increased pressure support provided by the magnetic field. As time progresses, however, the magnetic field is dissipated through ohmic dissipation and turbulence driven by gravitational instabilities. Once this happens, the disc becomes thinner and more flared compared to non-magnetic models."}
{"text":"We study the global properties of solar active regions by using high-resolution magnetograms, vector magnetic fields (VMB), and photospheric velocity maps obtained with Hinode\/SOT\/SP. We find that there is an anti-correlation between the inclination angle of the coronal field lines at the PILs and the amount of newly emerged flux in ARs. The correlation coefficient decreases as we go to higher latitudes. This suggests that the emergence of new flux plays an important role for determining the structure of the coronal field above the PILs. In addition, we found that the distribution of the inclination angles of the coronal field line depends on their distance from the center of the sunspot group. The results suggest that the evolution of the coronal field can be understood if one takes into account both the emergence of new flux and the differential rotation.

{"text":"The cumulative spectral power (CSP) is introduced as an alternative to the traditional method in analyzing earthquake data, which has been widely used by seismologists and geophysicists since it was first proposed by Aki(1957). The new tool can be applied to both earthquakes with known locations and those without any information on their epicenters. It also provides more detailed information about the source mechanism than that obtained using the traditional method. In this study we apply the new technique to analyze two large earthquakes occurred in China during recent years. We find that the results are consistent with previous studies based on other methods. This suggests that the new tool may provide useful information for studying seismic activities. Keywords: Earthquake; Source mechanism; Cumulative spectral power. 1 Introduction.\nSeismological research plays an important role in understanding the physical processes involved in earthquakes. Since its introduction into seismology by Aki(1957), the traditional method of calculating the cumulative energy released by earthquakes has become one of the most popular techniques among seismologists and geophysics researchers. However, there have been some problems associated with this method such as: i)it requires accurate location of the epicenter before analysis; ii)the result depends strongly upon the choice of time window length; iii)it cannot give enough information about the source mechanisms of earthquakes. To overcome these difficulties, many attempts have been made recently to develop new tools for analyzing earthquake data. For example, Sato et al.(1989) , Kao & Chen(1990) , Wu & Chiao(1991a , 1991b )and Wu(1993 developed different approaches to calculate the cumulative energy release rate. These authors found that the results were not always consistent with each other due to differences in the assumptions they had adopted."}
{"text":"We present the results of our numerical simulations on the shallow-decay phase of GRB X-ray light curves, which are produced by the interaction between an ultra-relativistic jet and its surrounding medium in the framework of the internal shock model for GRBs. We find that this phase is mainly due to the continuous energy injection into the forward shock driven by the expanding bubble formed at the head of the jet. The injected energy comes from the kinetic energy of the swept-up shell material as well as the thermal energy of shocked ambient gas inside the bubble. Our simulation results show good agreement with observations both qualitatively and quantitatively. \n \n Keywords: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), Afterglow emission, Relativistic winds, Shock waves, Bubbles, Internal shocks, Wind-driven shells, Energy injection, Light curve modeling \n \n 1 Introduction \n \n In recent years, great progress has been made in understanding the origin of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs; see Piran 2004 , Zhang 2007a . It was found that most GRBs have their prompt emissions followed by a relatively smooth power-law decline lasting several hundred seconds known as the \"afterglow\" phase (Costa et al. 1997; van Paradijs et al. 1997) . This phase can be explained by synchrotron radiation from electrons accelerated behind the blast wave generated when the ejecta hits the circumburst medium (Sari et al. 1998 ). However, some GRB afterglows exhibit a shallower-than-power law decline during hundreds of seconds before entering the normal afterglow phase (e.g., Panaitescu & Kumar 2001; Nousek et al. 2006; Liang et al. 2007; Willingale et al. 2007) , which cannot be explained within the standard fireball model. Several models were proposed to explain these phenomena, including late-time central engine activity (Zhang 2007b ), refreshed-shock scenario (Ghisellini et al. 2007 ) and reverse shock emission (Kobayashi 2000; Kobayashi & Sari 2001) . Recently, Fan & Wei (2007) suggested that the shallow-decay phase"}
{"text":"We present some new results on the monotonicity, stability and construction of central difference schemes for nonlinear systems of hyperbolic conservation laws with nonlocal source terms. We consider two types of source term models: one is the relaxation model in which the source term can be written as an integral over the past history; another is the fractional step method where the source term is treated implicitly by solving a system of ordinary differential equations at each time level. The main idea behind our approach to construct stable numerical methods is based on the concept of entropy conservative fluxes introduced recently by Tadmor et al.. In particular, we show that any scheme constructed using these entropy conservative fluxes will automatically preserve positivity if it satisfies certain conditions.

{"text":"We present the results of an analysis to determine whether physical vetoes can be used as part of a pipeline to reduce false alarms in searches for gravitational waves (GWs) from binary black hole mergers and other astrophysical sources.  We use data collected by the LIGO detectors during their fifth science run, which took place between September 2005 and January 2007. The search pipeline is based on matched filtering with template waveforms that are generated using post-Newtonian expansions up to 3PN order. In addition to standard cuts applied to the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), we also apply two different types of physical vetoes:  1) Vetoing events whose SNRs exceed some threshold value when they occur simultaneously at multiple detector sites; 2) Vetoing events where there is evidence of excess power above background noise levels in the frequency bands below 100 Hz or above 1000 Hz. For each type of veto, we define a set of parameters that control its effectiveness. Using these parameters, we perform Monte Carlo simulations to study how well the vetoes reject simulated signals injected into real detector data. Our main result shows that both types of physical vetoes significantly improve our ability to detect GW signals while keeping the number of false positives low."}
{"text":"We present an analysis of the recently proposed $\\Delta H(M ,\\Delta M )$ method for determining the distribution function of the intrinsic switching fields (ISF). The ISF is defined as the minimum applied magnetic field required to switch magnetization vectors between two stable states with opposite directions along the easy axis. We show that this method can be used only if the initial state of the system has been prepared by applying a sufficiently large external magnetic field and then removing it. In addition we demonstrate how one can use the same approach to determine the distribution functions of other important parameters such as anisotropy constant and exchange stiffness coefficient. Finally, we discuss possible applications of our results to experimental studies on perpendicularly recorded data storage devices. DOI: 10.1088\/1742-6596\/aa6b20\nThe determination of the distribution function of the switching fields in perpendicular recording media is crucial for understanding their physical properties and improving their performance. Recently, a new method was suggested which allows one to extract information about the switching field distribution directly from measurements of hysteresis loops [1] . This method relies on measuring the dependence of the coercive force $H_c$ on the magnitude $M_0$ of the saturation magnetization vector at different values of the angle $\\theta$ between the direction of the external magnetic field and the easy axis of the sample. It turns out that the measured dependence $H_c(M_0, \\theta)$ contains all necessary information needed to reconstruct the switching field distribution function $P_{H}(H)$ using the following formula: \n$$P_H(H) = \\frac{1}{2}\\delta(H - H_c(M_0)) + \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} P_M(M_0) \\delta(H - H_c[M_0]) dM_0 \\tag{1} $$\nwhere $P_M(M_0)$ denotes the probability density function of the saturation magnetization. \nIn Ref. 1, Eq. (1) was derived under the assumption that the initial state of the sample had already been prepared by applying a strong enough external magnetic field and then turning off the field."}
{"text":"The focusing effect on relativistic electrons by an electrostatic lens is investigated theoretically for different values of the charge density, radius and potential difference between two spherical electrodes. The results are compared with those obtained using the so-called \"effective momentum\" approximation (EMA). It has been found that EMA gives good agreement only when the electron energy is much higher than its rest mass energy. For lower energies it overestimates the focal length as well as the maximum value of the electric field strength at the focus point. This discrepancy can be explained by taking into account the contribution to the total force acting upon the particle due to the magnetic component of the Lorentz force. In this case we have shown that the focal length decreases while the maximum electric field increases. \n \n We also show how the focal properties depend on the initial direction of motion of the incident beam. Finally, we discuss possible applications of such lenses in accelerator physics."}

{"text":"The rapidity and transverse momentum (pT) dependences of the electric charge correlation functions are studied for central Au+Au, d+Au and p+p collisions at RHIC and LHC energies using the AMPT model with string melting mechanism. The results show that there is no significant difference between the charge correlation functions obtained by different collision systems except for small differences around midrapidity region which may be due to the initial state effects. It can also be seen that the charge correlation function decreases as the center-of-mass energy increases. This behavior indicates that the strength of charge separation effect becomes weaker when going from lower to higher energies. Finally it should be noted that the charge correlation functions calculated here have been found to agree well with those measured experimentally. PACS numbers: 25.75.-q, 11.15.-x, 12.38.Mh  Electric charge fluctuations play an important role in understanding many interesting phenomena observed in heavy-ion collisions such as charge balance functions [1] , net-charge fluctuations [2] , etc.. In recent years, several experiments [3-6] have reported measurements on these quantities in various collision systems ranging from proton-proton(pp), deuteron-gold(d-Au) to gold-gold(Au-Au). These experimental data provide valuable information about the properties of hot and dense nuclear matter produced in high-energy nucleus-nucleus collisions [7-9] .

One possible way to study charge fluctuations is through measuring the charge correlation functions [13-15] .

{"text":"Quantum zero-knowledge proofs are quantum protocols that allow one party to prove knowledge of some secret information without revealing any other information about it.  In this work, we study the general properties of these proofs and show how they can be used in order to construct efficient quantum authentication schemes for classical messages. We also present several applications of our results including new constructions of quantum key distribution (QKD) systems with unconditional security guarantees against collective attacks as well as improved QKD systems based on weak coherent pulses. Finally, we discuss possible extensions of our results towards more practical scenarios where the communication between Alice and Bob is not perfect but rather noisy or lossy. Quantum zero-knowledge proofs were introduced by Wiesner [1] , Brassard et al [2] and Cleve [3] . These proofs are quantum protocols that enable one party, called Alice, to convince another party, called Bob, that she knows certain secret information while keeping her secrets hidden. More formally, let us consider an interactive protocol between Alice and Bob consisting of two phases:  The first phase consists of a series of rounds during which Alice sends qubits to Bob who performs measurements on them according to his choice of measurement bases. At the end of each round, Bob announces publicly whether he accepts or rejects the received state. If Bob accepts at least half of all states sent by Alice then the second phase begins; otherwise, the protocol ends after the current round. During the second phase, Alice reveals her secrets to Bob if he accepted enough states in the previous phase. Otherwise, both parties abort the protocol. It was shown in [4] that such a proof system exists if and only if there exist one-way functions. However, no explicit construction of such proofs has been known until now."}
{"text":"We propose an entropy-weighted sum over non-perturbative vacua in the context of string theory, which is motivated by recent developments on black hole information loss and holography.  We consider a class of models with multiple metastable supersymmetric ground states that are separated by barriers of finite height. The decay rate for each state into other states can be computed using instanton methods. In this case we find that the total decay widths add up to zero if one sums over all possible final states. This implies that there exists a conserved quantity associated with the system, whose value depends only on its initial conditions. We then show how such a conservation law arises naturally within our framework as a consequence of the statistical mechanics of the underlying microscopic degrees of freedom. Finally, we discuss some implications of these results for quantum gravity phenomenology. Our work was inspired by earlier works of Susskind, Maldacena, Strominger, Witten, Banks et al., but it differs significantly from them both conceptually and technically."}

{"text":"We study the standard form of multimode Gaussian states, which is an important tool in quantum information theory for characterizing their properties. We show that any pure or mixed multimode Gaussian state can be transformed into its standard form by applying only local unitary transformations on each mode. This result provides a simple way to engineer multimode Gaussian states with desired properties using only local operations. In particular, we present several examples showing how this method works. Finally, we discuss some open problems related to our results. Introduction-Entangled states are one of the most fundamental resources in quantum information science [1] . Multimode Gaussian states play an important role as they have been shown to be useful in many applications such as quantum teleportation [2] , quantum key distribution [3] , quantum metrology [4] , and quantum communication [5] .\nIn recent years there has been much interest in studying these states [6] - [12] . However, it remains challenging to characterize them completely due to their high dimensionality. One approach to tackle this problem is to find a canonical representation of all possible multimode Gaussian states. The so-called standard form (SF) [13] plays an essential role here since it allows us to describe all multimode Gaussian states in terms of a set of parameters including mean values and covariance matrices. It also enables us to compare different states easily without worrying about their specific representations. For example, if two states share the same SF then they cannot be distinguished by any measurement performed locally on either side [14] . Moreover, the SF gives rise to a convenient description of the action of local unitaries [15] . Therefore, finding the SF of a given state is crucial for understanding its physical properties [16] .\nThe SF was first introduced in Ref. [17] where it was proved that every single-mode Gaussian state can always be transformed into its SF via local unitary operations. Later, Refs. [18] and [19] extended this result to arbitrary multimode Gaussian states. More recently, Ref. [20] showed that any multimode Gaussian state can always be brought into its SF by applying local symplectic transformations instead of general local unitary ones.

{"text":"We present models for the cosmic acceleration based on modified gravity theories in which the gravitational constant G varies with time and space, but is constrained to be close to its current value by local tests such as those performed within our solar system.  We show how these models can evade solar-system tests while still being consistent with cosmological observations at large redshifts (z > 1). The resulting predictions are compared against recent measurements of galaxy clustering statistics obtained using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III. These results suggest that future surveys will provide an important test of this class of models. Introduction - In recent years there has been considerable interest in modifying general relativity so that it includes additional degrees of freedom beyond just the metric tensor [1] . One particularly interesting possibility involves replacing Einstein's constant G with some function G(x \u00b5 ) [2] , where x \u00b5 denotes coordinates in spacetime. Such modifications have been shown to lead naturally to late-time accelerating solutions [3] .\nIn order to avoid conflict with existing observational constraints [4] , one must ensure that any proposed modification does not significantly affect the dynamics of bodies moving under their own self-gravity [5] or the motion of objects orbiting around them [6] . This requirement leads to strong restrictions on possible forms of G(x \u00b5 ). For example, if we consider only static spherically symmetric configurations then the most general form allowed by Birkhoff's theorem takes the form [7, 8] \nwhere M Pl \u2261 1\/ \u221a G N \u2248 2 \u00d7 10 18 GeV is the reduced Planck mass, r s = GM\/c 2 is the Schwarzschild radius associated with the total mass M of the configuration, and \u03b1 0 , \u03b2 0 , \u03b3 0 are dimensionless constants whose values depend upon the particular theory considered [9] . If we now assume that the same functional dependence holds when considering more complicated systems, e.g., binary pulsars [10] , then we find that |\u03b1 0 \u2212 1| < 3\u00d710 \u22125 [11] , |\u03b2 0 +\u03b3 0 | < 4\u00d710 \u22126 [12] , and |\u03b3 0 \/\u03b2 0 | < 5\u00d710 \u22127 [13] ."}

{"text":"We report the observation of Landau levels (LLs) of Dirac fermions in single-layered graphite by using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy at low temperatures. \n \n The LLs are observed as periodic oscillations with magnetic field B, which is perpendicular to the sample surface. We find that the energy spacing between adjacent LLs decreases with increasing B. This behavior agrees well with theoretical predictions for massless Dirac fermions. In addition, we observe an unexpected peak structure near zero bias voltage Vbias = 0 mV on top of each LL. These peaks can be explained by assuming that they originate from localized states induced by disorder or impurities. Our results provide direct evidence for the existence of Dirac fermions in graphene-like materials such as graphite. Graphene has attracted much attention because it exhibits unique electronic properties originating from its two-dimensional honeycomb lattice [1] . Recently, several groups have succeeded in isolating monolayer sheets of carbon atoms arranged in a similar manner [2] , leading to renewed interest in this material [3] .\nIn contrast to conventional semiconductors, where electrons behave like massive particles, the charge carriers in graphene obey relativistic quantum mechanics [4] . As a result, their dynamics exhibit many unusual features including Klein tunnelling [5] , Zitterbewegung [6] , and half-integer quantum Hall effect [7, 8] . Moreover, the low-energy excitations in graphene are described by massless Dirac fermions [9] whose dispersion relation E(k) shows linear dependence around two inequivalent points K and K' in momentum space [10] .

The data were taken in two epochs separated by one year to allow us to search for any changes in the system's properties over time. We find that the amplitude of the phase variation is consistent with previous measurements made in the optical but we detect no significant change between our two epochs. This suggests that there are no large variations in the temperature structure or composition of this planet as it orbits its host star. Our results also show that the planet has a very high albedo in both bands which may be due to clouds and\/or haze.

In particular, the study of nonleptonic decay processes is very important because they provide valuable information about the internal structure of hadrons [2] .\nIt should be noted that most of the theoretical investigations have focused mainly on the so-called color-suppressed tree-level transitions which can occur only through annihilation diagrams [3] , while the effects of other types of Feynman graphs (such as penguin-like ones) were usually neglected [4] . However, it was shown recently [5] that the contribution coming from penguin-like Feynman graphs may play an essential role in explaining certain puzzling phenomena observed in experiments [6] . For example, it was found [7] that the branching ratio of the decay mode $\\psi(2S ) \\to \\pi \\pi \\gamma$ predicted within the naive factorization approximation [8] is much smaller than its measured value [9] .

{"text":"The authors present the results of their study on the properties of two different types of systems, which are both characterized by an asymmetric distribution of charge carriers and exhibit unconventional superconducting behavior.  The first type is represented by layered compounds with alternating layers of conducting and insulating material (e.g., SrTiO3\/SrRuO3\/LaAlO3). In these materials, the presence of strong electron correlations leads to the formation of two-dimensional electronic states at the interface between the layers that can be described as a doped Mott insulator. These interfaces act like Josephson junctions and give rise to a spontaneous current perpendicular to the layers. This current causes a magnetic field to penetrate into the sample even when no external magnetic fields are applied. The second class consists of quasi-one-dimensional conductors such as carbon nanotubes or semiconductor nanowires. Here, the asymmetry arises because one end of the wire has been terminated by chemical functionalization."}

However, we detect significant changes in the emission measure which are correlated to the optical light curve. These results suggest that the mass loss rate from the white dwarf varies on timescales as short as days. This may be due to an unstable nuclear burning shell or possibly accretion disk instabilities.

{"text":"The effect of the ion clearing electrodes (ICE) on beam dynamics is studied by means of tracking simulations with ASTRA code for different values of ICE voltage and magnetic field strength at injection energy. The results show that the ICE can reduce the emittance growth due to space charge effects, but it also increases the vertical dispersion which leads to an increase of the beta function at IP. This may cause problems when using this scheme as a compensation method for chromatic aberrations. It has been found that the optimal value of ICE voltage depends strongly on the initial conditions such as bunch length and transverse size. \n \n Keywords: Space Charge, Emittance Growth, Chromatic Aberration Compensation, Tracking Simulations, Damping Ring, Accelerator Physics. 1 Introduction In order to achieve high luminosity in future linear colliders like CLIC [1] , the beams need to be focused tightly into small spots at interaction points (IP).

To overcome these difficulties, several schemes have been proposed including the use of ion clearing electrodes [3] .\n \nIn this work we study the impact of ion clearing electrodes on beam dynamics in DAFNE [4] .

{"text":"In this work, we consider the problem of rate adaptation in cognitive radio networks (CRNs) with interference from primary users (PUs). We propose an algorithm that jointly optimizes the transmission power and subcarrier allocation to maximize the average data rates while satisfying quality-of-service requirements on outage probability at each secondary user (SU), subject to PUs' interference constraints. The proposed algorithm is based on Lagrangian relaxation techniques combined with successive convex approximation methods. Numerical results show that our approach significantly improves SU's performance compared to existing schemes. In addition, it can be easily extended to incorporate other practical considerations such as imperfect channel state information and time-varying channels. Keywords: Rate adaptation, cognitive radio network, interference management, resource optimization, spectrum sharing. 1 Introduction With the rapid development of wireless communication systems, there has been growing interest in exploiting unused licensed bands by unlicensed or secondary users (SUs) . This new paradigm known as cognitive radio [1] , allows SUs to opportunistically access these licensed bands without causing harmful interference to PUs [2] . However, due to the dynamic nature of both the licensed and unlicensed bands, the available bandwidth varies over time [3] .\nTo cope with varying bandwidth availability, CRNs need to adapt their operating parameters accordingly [4] . For example, if more bandwidth becomes available, then higher data rates may be achieved; otherwise lower data rates are required [5] . Therefore, efficient rate adaptation algorithms play an important role in improving system performance [6] - [8] . To date, most works have focused on maximizing the sum-rate [9]- [11] and\/or minimizing the total transmit power [12] - [14] of all SUs. These approaches ignore the fact that different SUs may require different levels of service guarantees [15] . As a result, they cannot guarantee QoS requirements for individual SUs [16] . Moreover, since the number of active SUs changes dynamically [17] , the optimal solution obtained using previous approaches may not always satisfy the QoS requirements [18] ."}

Most of these sources are known to be variable both photometrically as well as spectroscopically. Some of them undergo large amplitude variations while others do not. It was suggested by Herbst et al. (1994) that some of these sources may experience episodic accretion events similar to classical TTS. Recent theoretical models suggest that such eruptions can occur when the inner edge of the circumstellar disk moves inward towards the central star because of viscous evolution or gravitational instability (Vorobyov & Bas"}
{"text":"We study the flavor structure of an extension of the Standard Model with three families of quarks, leptons and vector-like heavy neutrinos in which all particles are non-chiral but have different masses. We show that this model can be described by two independent parameters only, one being the Cabibbo angle \u03b8C . The other parameter is determined by the ratio between the mass differences of the first generation of up-type quarks and charged leptons to their respective average masses. In addition we find that the CKM matrix elements Vud , Vus and Vub as well as the PMNS matrix element Ue3 are related to each other through simple relations involving these two parameters. Finally, we discuss how our results relate to recent experimental data on lepton-flavor violating processes such as neutrinoless double beta decay or muon-to-electron conversion in nuclei. Introduction -The Standard Model (SM) describes physics at energies below the electroweak scale v\u2248246 GeV [1] . It contains three chiral generations of quarks and leptons whose interactions are governed by gauge symmetries SU(3)c \u00d7SU(2)L \u00d7U(1)Y [2] . However, there exist many indications that the SM cannot provide a complete description of nature [3] .\nIn particular, it does not explain why the observed pattern of fermion masses and mixings [4] differs so much from what would naively follow from the gauge symmetry breaking mechanism [5] . Moreover, the SM has no explanation for the origin of CP violation [6] nor for the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe [7, 8] . Furthermore, the Higgs boson discovered at the LHC [9, 10] appears to behave very differently than expected within the SM [11] . These problems may point towards new physics beyond the SM [12] .\nOne possible approach to address some of these issues consists in extending the SM particle content while keeping its gauge group intact [13] . This idea was pursued in several papers [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27,"}
{"text":"We report on the observation of giant magnetoresistance (GMR) effect in Ni80Fe20\/Nb\/Ni80Fe20 magnetic tunnel junctions with an ultrathin Nb spacer layer, which is as thin as 1 nm and 2 nm respectively. The GMR ratio can reach up to ~80% at room temperature for both samples. We propose that this large GMR effect originates mainly from spin dependent scattering between two adjacent ferromagnetic layers through the stray fields generated by one ferromagnet into another. This work may provide new insights into understanding the physics behind the spin-dependent transport properties in magnetic tunnel junctions. \n \n Magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ), consisting of two ferromagnets separated by a very thin insulating barrier, has been widely studied due to its potential applications in high density nonvolatile memories [1] . In recent years, MTJs have attracted much attention because they are promising candidates for next generation spintronic devices such as read heads [2] , microwave oscillators [3] , logic circuits [4] , etc.. However, there still exist some problems preventing their practical application, e.g., low thermal stability [5] , poor reproducibility [6] , and relatively small magnetoresistive effects [7, 8] .\nRecently, it was found that the interlayer exchange coupling plays an important role in determining the magnetization reversal process [9] . It also affects the spin-dependent transport behavior significantly [10] . Therefore, many efforts have been made to enhance the interlayer exchange coupling strength [11] - [13] . For example, using CoFeB\/MgO\/CoFeB structure instead of conventional FeCo\/AlOx\/FeCo structure could greatly increase the interlayer exchange coupling [14] . Moreover, inserting a non-magnetic metal layer like Cu or Ag between two ferromagnetic layers would lead to stronger interlayer exchange coupling [15] . On the other hand, inserting a non-magnetically conducting material like SiO2 [16] or Al2O3 [17] between two ferromagnetic layers will decrease the interlayer exchange coupling."}
{"text":"We present an analysis of the absorption features in the spectrum of distant quasars by intergalactic neutral hydrogen (IGH). We use the observed Lyman-alpha forest as a probe for the number density distribution function of absorbers along the lines-of-sight and compare it with predictions based on various evolutionary scenarios. The main goal is to test whether the absorber population evolves self-similarly or not, i.e., if its properties are determined solely by the local environment at each redshift z or also depend on the global history of structure formation. In particular we consider two classes of evolutionary models: one where the number density of absorbers depends only on their distance r from the observer but does not evolve with time, and another class where the number density of absorbing clouds decreases exponentially with increasing look-back time t. For both cases we derive analytical expressions which allow us to calculate the expected mean transmitted flux F(z) as well as higher-order moments of the probability distribution P(F) of the transmitted flux. Using these results we can then compute the corresponding values of the effective optical depth \u03c4eff = \u2212 ln F and the variance \u03c32\u03c4eff \u2261< [\u03c4eff\u2212 < \u03c4eff >] 2 >1\/2 .

{"text":"We present an extensive form game that is played on the vertices and edges of a graph, where each player has to choose one vertex or edge at every turn. The payoff for choosing a particular vertex depends only on its neighbors in the previous round; similarly, the payoff for choosing an edge depends only on the two endpoints chosen by both players in the previous round. We show how this game can be represented as a quantum circuit with polynomial size. This representation allows us to use Grover's algorithm to find Nash equilibria efficiently. Finally we prove that finding pure strategy Nash equilibria is NP-hard even if there are no cycles in the underlying graph. In recent years, several researchers have studied games which involve multiple agents making decisions simultaneously over time. These games are called extensive-form games (EFGs) because they consist of a tree structure representing all possible sequences of actions taken by the agents. A key problem associated with EFGs is computing Nash equilibria - strategies such that none of the agents would benefit from deviating unilaterally. Unfortunately, it is known that finding Nash equilibria in general EFGs is PPAD-complete [Papadimitriou 1994] . However, many interesting classes of EFGs admit efficient algorithms for finding Nash equilibria. For example, when the number of agents is fixed [Koller et al., 1997 , Papadimitriou & Roughgarden, 2005 , Rosenberg et al., 2007 , von Stengel & Zamir, 2004 ], or when the trees involved are shallow [Rothkopf & Harstad, 1998 ].

Our proposed method is illustrated using two examples involving missing data: one where there was no unobserved confounding but some subjects had incomplete outcome information; another example where both incomplete outcome information and unmeasured confounders affected estimation. The first example shows that our proposed method provides estimates similar to those obtained under complete follow-up when all relevant variables have been measured. In contrast, the second example illustrates situations where standard approaches may lead to biased results due to either incomplete outcome information or unmeasured confounding.

{"text":"The thermodynamic properties of lasers are studied in the framework of discrete statistical mechanics, which is based on the concept that entropy can be defined as information content and thus has an intrinsic connection to probability theory.  The first law of thermodynamics for closed systems is derived by considering the change in Shannon's entropy between two states of equilibrium. This leads to a generalized expression for the internal energy of the system, including both thermal and non-thermal contributions. In particular, it is shown how this formalism allows one to describe the process of stimulated emission within laser cavities. Finally, we discuss some possible applications of our approach to quantum optics experiments. We show that the second law of thermodynamics follows naturally from the definition of entropy given above if one assumes that the probabilities associated with different microstates of the system satisfy certain conditions. These conditions correspond physically to the requirement that the system must have well-defined macroscopic properties such as temperature or pressure."}

The inferred magnetic field strengths are consistent with those expected from theoretical models of magnetorotationally driven turbulence within these systems. \n \n Keywords: Dust, Polarization, Magnetism, Planets, Disk, Millimeter-wave Astronomy, Astrophysics, Astrochemistry \n \n 1. Introduction \n \n In recent years there has been growing interest in understanding how dust particles grow into planetesimals during the early stages of planet formation. This process involves collisions between dust particles which can be destructive if they occur at high velocities. However, it was shown by Goldreich & Ward (1973) that this problem could be overcome if the dust particles were aligned with respect to their local magnetic fields such that their angular momenta pointed along the direction of the magnetic field lines. If so, then the collisional cross sections would increase dramatically because the relative velocity vectors would tend to align themselves perpendicularly to each other rather than head-on. Thus, the growth timescale for dust particles would decrease significantly compared to what one would expect without any alignment mechanism. \n \n It follows that an important step towards understanding the physics behind planet formation is to determine whether or not dust particles are indeed efficiently aligned with respect to their surrounding magnetic fields. To date, several studies have attempted to address this question through observations of scattered light from circumstellar disks around young stars (e.g., Kataoka et al. (2015), Yang et al. (2016)). These authors found evidence suggesting that dust particles may be partially aligned but only over limited regions near the star where the gas density is relatively high.

{"text":"We present an approach to robust multi-cellular developmental design that combines the advantages of both bottom-up and top-down approaches, while avoiding their respective disadvantages. The proposed method is based on a novel concept called \"embryonic development space (EDS)\" which represents all possible designs in terms of cell types and connections between them. We show how EDS can be used for efficient exploration of different designs by applying evolutionary algorithms. Finally we demonstrate our approach using two case studies - one synthetic and another biological. Robustness has been recognized as one of the most important features of living systems [1] . In particular, it plays crucial role during embryogenesis when cells differentiate into various tissues and organs [2] , but also later in life [3] .\nIn this work we propose a new computational framework for designing robust multicellular systems. Our approach combines the advantages of both \"bottom-up\" [4] and \"top-down\" [5] methods, while overcoming some of their limitations. Bottom-up methods are typically applied to model cellular differentiation [6] or morphogenetic processes [7] . They usually start with a single cell type and then evolve towards more complex structures through successive divisions and\/or mutations [8] . Top-down methods use genetic programming [9] or other optimization techniques [10] to search for optimal solutions within pre-defined constraints [11] .

The exponent 2\/3 agrees well with previous results obtained within mean-field theory but deviates significantly from the value 1 expected for standard DP. This discrepancy can be explained by taking into account corrections to scaling due to irrelevant operators. In addition we show how these findings are related to recent experiments performed on colloidal systems. Finite-size scaling analysis has been used extensively over the past decades to determine the universality class of phase transitions [1] . It relies on the fact that close to a continuous transition the free energy density $f(T,V)$ depends only weakly on temperature $T$ or volume $V$ so that it may be expanded around its minimum $T_c$ or $V_c$ up to second order terms as: \n$$f(T,V)=f_0+T_r(T-T_c)^2+V_s(V-V_c)^2$$\nwhere $r$ and $s$ denote the so-called reduced exponents [2] .\nIn this expression, the first term describes the singular part of the free energy while the remaining two represent non-singular contributions.

Planets formed in such disks tend to be less massive but larger compared to those formed in standard protoplanetary disks. This may explain why some extrasolar planets appear to be too small while others seem to be overly massive.

We find that this object is similar to other distant FR-II sources but it also exhibits some unusual properties. In particular, its luminosity is higher than expected based on the correlation between jet power and lobe luminosity observed locally. This may be due to either relativistic beaming effects and\/or a high accretion rate onto the central black hole. Using deep Chandra observations we detect diffuse soft X-rays extending out to several hundred kiloparsecs around the core of the cluster which are likely produced via thermal bremsstrahlung radiation.

The problem is formulated in terms of minimizing total power consumption subject to per-user rate constraints. It has been shown recently that the optimal solution to this problem requires joint optimization over both precoding matrices and power allocation coefficients. In order to solve this non-convex problem efficiently, we propose two algorithms based on successive convex approximation technique.

The obtained results are discussed within the framework of the recently developed concept of ``inverse condensation''. Introduction: In recent years there has been growing interest in studying strongly correlated systems where competing interactions lead to complex phase diagrams exhibiting various exotic phases such as valence bond solids (VBS), charge density waves (CDW) or supersolids [1-3]. One of the most interesting examples is provided by layered quantum antiferromagnets [4] . These compounds consist of weakly coupled planes of spins arranged into a regular lattice structure. Due to strong geometrical frustration caused by competing nearest-neighbor exchange interactions J1 along the chain direction and J2 across the chains, these materials exhibit a rich variety of physical phenomena ranging from conventional N\u00e9el order at low temperatures down to disordered paramagnetic phases [5] .\nIn this work we consider two prototypical representatives of this class of materials: CuGeO3 [6] , where each plane consists of edge-sharing tetrahedra forming a honeycomb-like network [7, 8] , and BaCo2As2 [9] , where the planes are made up of corner-sharing triangles [10] . Both compounds have attracted considerable attention due to their unusual magnetic behavior [11, 12] . For example, it was shown experimentally that in CuGeO3 the system undergoes a transition from a collinear antiferromagnetically ordered state below TN = 29 K to a non-collinear VBS state above T* ~ 70 K [13] . On the other hand, for BaCo2As2 the situation seems more complicated since several experimental studies suggest coexistence of three different magnetic phases [14, 15] : a commensurate antiferromagnetically ordered phase below TC = 38 K; a helimagnetic"}

In this work we study how the magnitude of the Casimir force depends on the optical properties of the boundaries between which it acts. We consider three different cases corresponding to (i) perfectly reflecting mirrors, (ii) dielectric mirrors, and (iii) metallic mirrors. For all these cases we calculate numerically the Casimir energy density using the Lifshitz theory.

{"text":"We present an analysis of the shallow decay segment in X-ray afterglow light curves observed by Swift\/XRT, which is based on our previous work (Zhang et al., 2006) . We find that there are two types of shallow decays with different physical origins.

However, we show that this scenario cannot explain all cases of shallow decays. In particular, it fails to account for those shallow decays occurring at late times when the external shock emission should have faded away completely. For these events, we propose another explanation -the second type of shallow decays-which may arise from the transition between the relativistic fireball phase and non-relativistic ejecta-dominated phase. This new interpretation naturally explains why some shallow decays occur only at late times while others appear both early and late during the afterglow evolution. \n \n Keywords: Afterglow, Energy injection, Fireball model"}

In particular we find that this profile decays exponentially fast as one moves away from the origin. This result implies that the system exhibits dynamic screening, i.e., correlations decay exponentially fast at large distances even though the underlying microscopic model does not have translational invariance.

{"text":"We present the results of subjective evaluation experiments conducted on forms designed for use within immersive environments, such as virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR). The goal is to investigate how users perceive different form designs when immersed in these environments. We compare three designs: traditional 2D forms, 3D forms that are rendered using perspective projection, and 3D forms that are rendered with orthographic projection. Our findings show that there were no significant differences between the two types of 3D forms. However, both 3D forms received significantly higher ratings than their 2D counterparts. This suggests that 3D forms can be used effectively in immersive environments without requiring special rendering techniques or additional hardware. In addition, we found that participants preferred forms that had more visual cues indicating depth information over those that did not have any such cues. Finally, our study also shows that it may be possible to create effective forms by combining elements from multiple existing designs."}
{"text":"We study number density correlation functions (NDCFs) in classical one-component plasma at high temperatures and find that they are not well defined due to infrared divergences, which is related with the fact that NDCF can be expressed as an integral over the whole space. We show how these difficulties can be overcome by introducing a new quantity called local number density correlation function (LNDCF). The LNDCF has no infrared divergence but it still contains information about correlations between particles on different length scales. In particular we calculate LNDCF for two limiting cases - when all particles have equal velocities or when their distribution is Maxwellian. Finally we discuss possible applications of our results.

{"text":"We report on experiments performed with liquid sodium to investigate rapidly-rotating flows driven by differential rotation between two concentric spheres, one of which is magnetized and spins faster than its non-magnetic counterpart. The experiment was conducted at the von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n Sodium Facility (VKSF) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. We find that for sufficiently large angular velocities, the fluid develops into a steady state characterized by a large-scale vortex structure consisting of multiple toroidal vortices. These results are compared against numerical simulations using the spectral element code Nek5000. In addition, we present measurements of the Reynolds stresses associated with this flow as well as their dependence upon the imposed magnetic field strength. Finally, we discuss how these results may be relevant to understanding the dynamics of planetary cores. This work has been supported by NSF grant PHY-0960091. A rapidly-rotating spherical Couette flow can develop into a steady-state configuration when it is confined within a container whose inner sphere rotates more quickly than its outer counterpart. \n \n Herein, we describe laboratory experiments carried out with liquid sodium to explore such flows under conditions where both the inner and outer spheres were spinning but only the former had a strong magnetic dipole moment. Our experiments were conducted at the von Karamn Sodium Facility (VNSF), located at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison.

We show that MQT is suppressed by thermal fluctuations and magnetic field, but can be enhanced by applying a bias current or increasing the junction area. The results are compared with experiments performed at 4 K and 77 K. In particular we find good agreement between our theoretical predictions and experimental data obtained recently on YBa2Cu3O7-x single crystals. \n \n Introduction \n \n Superconductivity was discovered more than half a century ago [1] . Since then many new materials have been found which exhibit this fascinating phenomenon [2] , including some with very high transition temperatures T_c [3] . However, despite intensive research efforts there still remain several open questions about the nature of these novel compounds [4] . One such question concerns the mechanism responsible for their unusual properties [5] . \n \n It has been suggested [6] that the pairing interaction may involve phonons [7 - 9] as well as spin excitations [10 - 12] . This leads to two possible scenarios for the formation of Cooper pairs [13] : either they form directly out of electrons via electron-phonon interactions [14] , or indirectly through spin-fluctuations [15] . These different mechanisms lead to distinct physical pictures [16] . For example, if one assumes that the pairing occurs only due to electron-phonon interactions [17] , it follows that the gap function should vanish along certain lines in momentum space [18] . On the other hand, if one considers the possibility of pair formation mediated by spin fluctuations [19] , the gap function vanishes over all momenta [20] . \nThe most important feature of both types of models is that they predict the existence of nodes [21] in the energy spectrum [22] . Nodes occur when the order parameter changes sign across the Fermi surface [23] . They were first predicted theoretically [24 - 26] and later observed experimentally [27] ."}
{"text":"The self-duality condition on the curvature tensor is an important ingredient in supergravity theories, but it has been difficult to incorporate into superspace formulations because of its non-Lagrangian nature.  In this work we show how to construct Lagrangians for self-dual supergravities by using twistor theory as our guide.   We first review the basic ideas behind twistor theory and then use these results to develop new techniques that allow us to write down manifestly supersymmetric actions for self-dual supergravitational fields with arbitrary gauge groups.  The resulting action can be written either in terms of chiral or twisted-chiral superfields depending upon whether one uses the light-cone or covariant approach respectively.   Finally, we discuss some applications of these results including the construction of N = 1, D = 4 supergravity coupled to Yang-Mills multiplets.

{"text":"We study the mechanical properties of disordered networks of fibers with different bending rigidities by means of numerical simulations based on molecular dynamics (MD) and Monte Carlo (MC). We find that the elastic moduli are strongly dependent on the bending rigidity, which is related to the persistence length of the fibers. The results show that the shear modulus increases as the bending rigidity decreases while the bulk modulus remains almost unchanged for all values of the bending rigidity studied here. In addition we observe that the distribution functions of forces acting between particles depend significantly on the bending rigidity. For small bending rigidities there exist strong correlations among neighboring particles leading to large fluctuations in the local stress field. These findings suggest that the microscopic structure plays an important role in determining macroscopic material properties such as elasticity. Disordered networks of fibers have been widely used to model various materials ranging from biological tissues to granular media [1-3]. However, it has not yet been fully understood how the microstructure affects their macroscopic behavior. Here we investigate this problem using computer simulation techniques."}

We use mock galaxy catalogues to investigate the impact on cosmological parameter constraints when different combinations of optical (u*gri) and infrared (JHKs) bands are used in the photo-z determination process. The results show that including JHKs information improves the accuracy of photo-z estimates by up to 0.1 dex compared with only u*gri colours being available. This improvement is particularly significant at redshifts z > 1 where it leads to more accurate shear measurements which in turn lead to tighter constraints on dark energy parameters. However, we find that this improvement comes at the expense of increased systematic errors due to uncertainties in stellar population synthesis models. These effects must therefore be carefully considered before deciding whether to include JHKs data in the photo-z estimation pipeline."}

{"text":"We present an approach to decision tree learning that uses views over the data in order to improve efficiency and scalability. The proposed method is based on the idea of using multiple views, each one capturing different aspects or features of the same dataset. We show how this can be achieved by defining a set of views for each node in the decision tree model being learned. These views are then used as input to a modified version of the standard ID3 algorithm which learns the decision tree structure. Our experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in terms of both accuracy and execution time when compared against existing approaches. Decision trees have been widely applied in many areas such as classification, regression analysis, clustering, association rule mining, etc., due to their simplicity and effectiveness. However, they suffer from two main drawbacks: (1) high computational cost; and (2) poor scalability. In particular, the number of possible splits at any given internal node grows exponentially with respect to the size of its parent's training sample. This makes it difficult to build large decision trees efficiently. To address these problems we propose a novel approach called Relational Views-based Decision Tree Learning (RV-DTL). RV-DTL builds upon the concept of multi-view learning where each view captures some aspect(s) of the original data. More specifically, our approach defines a set of views for every internal node in the decision tree being built. Each view corresponds to a specific feature subset associated with the corresponding node. Then, instead of building the entire decision tree from scratch, RV-DTL starts with small sub-trees rooted at leaf nodes and iteratively expands them towards the root until all leaves are reached. At each expansion step, RV-DTL selects the best split among those available according to the information gain criterion. Finally, the final decision tree is constructed by merging together..."}

The observations are made in H\u03b1 and Ca II 8542 \u00c5 lines, which show that the fine structures have different shapes depending on their locations relative to the magnetic field. In addition, we find that there exist two types of fine structures; one type has an elongated shape along the direction parallel to the local magnetic field while another type shows a roundish shape perpendicularly to it. We also found that some fine structures appear as if they were twisted around each other. These results suggest that the fine structures may be formed due to the plasma flows driven by magnetic reconnection between neighboring flux tubes. Keywords: Solar prominence, Fine structure, Magnetic field, Plasma flow, Reconnection. 1 Introduction Solar prominences are observed as dark features against the bright background of the photosphere. They are thought to consist mainly of cool dense plasma suspended above the solar surface by magnetic fields (Kippenhahn & Schl\u00fcter 1957) . It was suggested that the fine structures seen within solar prominences might be caused by the plasma flows driven by the magnetic reconnection between neighboring magnetic flux tubes (Pneuman 1983 , Kuperus et al. 1981 . However, the detailed physical processes involved in this process remain unclear because of lack of observational evidence for such phenomena. Recently, high-resolution observations of solar prominences have been performed with various instruments including the Swedish 1-meter solar telescope (SST) (Lin et al. 1998a) , the Advanced Stokes Polarimeter (ASP) at Big Bear Solar Observatory (BBSO), and the Hinode satellite (Kosugi et al. 2007 ). Using these new data sets, several authors reported the observation of fine structures having different shapes depending on their positions relative to the magnetic field (Lin et al. 1998b , Lin 2004 , Berger et al. 2008 .\nIn this study, we investigate the fine structures of solar prominences based on the SST data set.

{"text":"We report on the observation of extremely slow hole spin dephasing and relaxation times T2* = 1 ms, T1 = 0.5 s at low temperatures (T < 20 K) for single holes confined to InAs\/GaAs self-assembled quantum dots. The observed values are more than one order of magnitude longer than those reported previously for electrons or holes in other semiconductor nanostructures such as quantum wells or wires. We show that this is due to the strong spin-orbit interaction combined with the large effective mass of heavy holes which leads to an enhanced coupling between the hole spins and nuclear magnetic moments. This results in a very efficient suppression of the hyperfine-induced spin relaxation by means of the Overhauser effect. Our findings demonstrate that self-assembled quantum dots can be used as ideal systems for studying fundamental physics phenomena related to the dynamics of individual carriers in semiconductors. They also open up new possibilities for applications based on optically addressable spin qubits in solid-state devices operating at cryogenic temperatures. \n \n Self-assembled quantum dots have been widely studied over recent years because they provide a unique opportunity to investigate carrier confinement effects in three dimensions [1] .

{"text":"We present new estimates for the optimal packing densities of spheres in high-dimensional spaces, as well as improved bounds on the kissing numbers of these packings.  We show that the optimal packing density is bounded below by $\\delta_{opt} \\geq 0.740\\ldots$ with an explicit constant depending only on the dimension $n$ (and not on the radius).  This improves upon previous lower bounds which were obtained using probabilistic arguments or numerical simulations.   In addition to this improvement we also provide upper bounds on the kissing number of such packings, showing that it grows at most exponentially fast in terms of the dimension n. These results are based on recent progress made in understanding the geometry of random polytopes in high dimensions. The problem of finding good dense packings of equal balls into Euclidean space has been studied extensively over many years [1\u20133] .

We show that the partition function is invariant under these deformations if we use the modified Feynman rules with the propagators having an extra factor $1\/(1 - \\beta^2 x)$ (real case) or $1\/(1 + \\beta e^{-ix})$ (complex case). The invariance can be understood intuitively using the picture of instantons. In particular, it turns out that the number of instanton solutions does not change when we vary the value of $\\beta$ continuously between 0 and 1. This implies that the vacuum expectation values of some operators do not depend on the choice of the regularization scheme even though they have different divergences at $\\beta = 0$. \nThe results presented here were obtained during my stay at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, NJ, USA, supported by JSPS Postdoctoral Fellowship for Research Abroad."}
{"text":"We present new numerical schemes to solve the Einstein equations in Kerr-Schild coordinates with multiple black holes and an outer boundary, which are based on high order accurate finite difference discretizations combined with efficient solvers using multigrid techniques. The main difficulty is that the computational domain contains several disconnected components (holes) where no grid points can be placed due to the presence of singularities at the locations of the black holes. We show how this problem can be overcome by introducing ghost points outside each component and applying appropriate boundary conditions there. In addition we use a special treatment near the horizon of each black hole to avoid problems related to coordinate singularities. Finally, we demonstrate our method by computing stationary axisymmetric solutions corresponding to two equal mass black holes located along the z-axis.

We show how our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods by achieving higher accuracy with lower computational cost. Our results suggest that the proposed method could be used to predict \u0394G values for thousands of mutants at once. Mutations in proteins are known to cause many human diseases including cancer1 and cystic fibross2. Therefore it is important to understand what effects these mutations have on the structure and function of proteins3-6. One way to investigate the impact of mutations is through their influence on the thermodynamic stability7-9 of proteins10-12. Thermodynamic stability refers to the free energy difference between folded and unfolded states13-15. A negative value indicates that the folded state has more favorable interactions than the unfolded state16-18 while positive values indicate unfavorable interactions19-21. It was shown22-24 that the change in Gibbs free energy upon folding (\u0394Gf) correlates well with experimental measurements25-27.

These results suggest that they may be powered by AGNs or starburst galaxies surrounded by dense gas clouds. In addition, we detect strong absorption lines associated with intervening systems along some sightlines toward these objects. This suggests that our targets are located behind massive halos of neutral hydrogen. Finally, we report on an interesting object showing both spatially unresolved and resolved emission line features. Our study provides new insights into the nature of high-redshift star-forming regions."}
{"text":"We study the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) in which all scalar superpartners are assumed to be very massive, and we show that it is possible for this model to have light neutralinos as dark matter candidates while still being consistent with current experimental bounds on supersymmetry.  We find that there exists an upper bound on the mass of the lightest neutralino, m\u03c70 1 < 104 GeV\/c2 , above which no solution can exist within our framework. This limit arises because the LSP must decay into gravitinos before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis; if its lifetime exceeds 1s then too much entropy will be produced by late decays to satisfy observational constraints. The lower bound on m\u03c70 1 depends upon tan\u03b2 . For large values of tan\u03b2 , m\u03c70 1 > 60GeV\/c2 ; however, for small values of tan\u03b2 , solutions with m\u03c70 1 = O(10GeV\/c2 ) may occur."}

In this class of models there exist exotic states such as color octets or triplets which can decay into pairs of quarks and\/or gluons leading to final state signatures similar to those expected from supersymmetric theories.

INTRODUCTORY REMARK\nIn this work we consider an Abelian Higgs model consisting of two complex scalar fields $\\psi$ and $\\phi$ interacting with each other as well as with fermions and gauge bosons. This system has been studied extensively in the literature [1] . However most previous works have focused on the case when the scalar fields couple directly to fermions or gauge bosons but not both. Here we will allow them to interact with all particles present in the theory. As such it should provide us with some insight about how different types of interactions affect the properties of matter under extreme conditions like high temperature and\/or high density. \nThe motivation behind studying this particular model comes mainly from condensed matter physics. It was shown recently [2] that the effective action describing the low energy dynamics of certain classes of strongly correlated electron systems contains a number of operators similar to those appearing in the standard electroweak Lagrangian. These include the usual Maxwell term for electromagnetism, the kinetic term for the Higgs field, and various four-fermion interactions. Since the latter are responsible for many interesting phenomena observed experimentally [3] , it would be very useful if we could understand their effects better using simple models."}

{"text":"We present an analytical model for the growth, radial drift and fragmentation of dust grains in protoplanetary disks that evolve under the combined effects of viscous accretion onto the central star and photoevaporation by external radiation fields. We show how these processes affect the evolution of grain size distributions as well as their spatial distribution within the disk. In particular we find that: (i) The maximum grain sizes are limited to values between 1 mm and 10 cm depending on the strength of the stellar UV field. (ii) Grains grow faster at larger distances from the star due to lower gas densities and higher temperatures. (iii) Fragmentation is more efficient closer to the star where the local pressure maxima lead to enhanced collisional velocities.

Our numerical results show that the theoretical predictions agree well with experimental data within errors. \n \n Introduction \n \n In recent years there has been great progresses made in understanding heavy flavor physics through experiments performed by BaBar [1] , Belle [2] , CLEO [3] and LHCb [4] Collaborations. Many interesting phenomena have been observed such as large CP violation effects in B mesons [5] .

This method takes into account all possible Feynman graphs contributing to the process under consideration and then separates out soft divergences appearing in loop integrals into universal functions called light cone distribution amplitudes(LCDA). These LCDA's contain only non-perturbative information and can be calculated either by lattice simulations or extracted from experiment [10] .

In addition we performed IR transmission spectroscopy experiments using synchrotron radiation as well as electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS).

{"text":"We report on measurements of the spin polarization in the ferromagnetic semiconductor EuS using two different spectroscopies, namely zero-field (ZF) and Zeeman split Andreev reflection (ZSAR). The ZF technique is based on measuring the conductance through an interface between a normal metal and a ferromagnet as function of the angle between magnetization directions of both materials. In contrast to this method we use the ZSAR technique which allows us to measure directly the spin polarization at the Fermi level by applying a small external field parallel to the sample surface. We find that for low temperatures below 10 K the results obtained by these techniques are consistent within experimental error bars. However, above T = 10 K there is a significant discrepancy between the values determined by the two methods. This may be explained by assuming that the temperature dependence of the spin polarization has a non-monotonic behavior. Our findings demonstrate that the combination of ZF and ZSAR experiments can provide valuable information about the electronic structure of ferromagnets."}
{"text":"We consider the Standard Model (SM) in 5 dimensions, where one extra dimension is compactified to an orbifold S 1 \/Z 2 . The SM fields are assumed to be localized at different fixed points along this extra dimension. We show that such models can naturally explain why there should exist three generations of fermions and gauge bosons with their observed masses and mixings. In addition we find that these models provide new ways for understanding some other issues related to the SM like neutrino mass generation or flavor changing neutral currents. Finally we discuss how our results could be tested experimentally. Introduction: One of the most important open questions in particle physics today concerns the origin of fermion families and their mixing angles. It has been known since the work by Pati & Salam [1] , that if quarks and leptons were unified into larger multiplets then it would be possible to understand the pattern of quark-lepton masses and mixings within Grand Unified Theories (GUTs). However, despite many attempts over more than 30 years no realistic GUT has yet been constructed which incorporates all the features of the Standard Model (SM).\nIn recent years another possibility was suggested [2] - [4] : If the SM fields live in higher dimensional space-time, they may have Kaluza-Klein excitations corresponding to additional states with masses of order 1\/R, where R denotes the size of the extra dimensions. These states might correspond to heavy particles beyond those present in the SM spectrum. This idea leads to interesting phenomenological consequences [5] .\nThe simplest way to realize this scenario is to assume that only gravity propagates in the bulk while the SM fields are confined to a four-dimensional \"brane\" [6] . Such theories lead to corrections to the Newtonian potential between two test masses m 1 and m 2 separated by distance r given by: \nwhere M P l = 1\/ \u221a 8\u03c0G N \u2248 10 19 GeV is the reduced Planck scale and n i counts the number of extra spatial dimensions accessible to field i.

[14] presented an optimized irregular repeat accumulate (OIRA) code ensemble whose threshold value matches the Shannon limit on the binary erasure channel (BEC) . This result suggests that OIRA may also achieve near-optimal performance on other channels [15] ."}
{"text":"We present an algorithm for determining whether two variables are independent given all other variables in the model, based on conditioning only up to order three (i.e., pairwise and triplet-wise). The method is applicable when the joint distribution can be represented as a factor graph with no loops or parallel edges between nodes representing the same variable. We show that this approach has several advantages over existing methods such as junction trees and clique tree propagation algorithms. In particular, it avoids the need to compute cliques explicitly, which may not exist if there are cycles in the graph; it also allows us to use efficient message-passing techniques instead of exact inference using junction trees. Finally, we demonstrate how our approach can be used to determine the Markov blanket of each node in the network efficiently. This work was supported by NSF grant CCF-0430018.

{"text":"The thermal stability and melting behavior of metallic single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) are investigated by using an efficient tight-binding molecular dynamics simulation method with the Tersoff potential function. The results show that SWCNTs can be melted at temperatures ranging from 2000 to 3000 K, depending on their diameters. It is found that the melting temperature increases as the diameter decreases for both zigzag- and armchair-type tubes. In addition, it is shown that the melting process involves two stages in which the tube wall first becomes disordered followed by the formation of liquid-like structures inside the tube. Finally, we find that the melting point of SWCNTs depends strongly on the chirality index n-m. For example, the melting points of zigzag-type SWCNTs increase rapidly when n-m changes from 0 to 1 or -1. \n \n Keywords: Thermal stability, Melting behavior, Carbon nanotube"}
{"text":"We present new measurements of the baryonic mass overdensity in the range 0.9 < z < 1.9, tracing the evolution of the Warm-Hot Intergalactic Medium (WHIM) using the Lyman-alpha forest. We use high-resolution spectra obtained by the VLT\/XSHOOTER spectrograph to measure the column densities and Doppler parameters for more than 1000 absorbers along four lines-of-sight towards quasars. The absorber sample is split into two redshift bins centered around z = 1.2 and z = 2.1 respectively. In each bin we fit Voigt profiles to all detected absorbers and derive their physical properties such as temperature, metallicity, and hydrogen number density. Our results show that the WHIM evolves significantly between these redshifts. At z=1.2-1.3 it has an average temperature T=(5200\u00b1500)K, log10(nH\/cm-3)=-14.7\u00b10.4, and solar-like metallicities Z\/Z\u2299\u22480.6-0.8.

The observations were carried out using the Submillimeter Array at 1.4 mm wavelength. We detected all these species except NH3 towards both sources. In addition to detections we also made upper limits on some other species like SO2, SiO, HNCO etc.. Our main findings are as follows:  -The abundance ratios between different species show that H2O is more abundant than any other molecule by several orders of magnitude.  -The derived column densities suggest that the physical conditions vary significantly across the observed region. -The chemical composition of the gas shows significant differences between the two sources. -The comparison of our data with previous studies suggests that there may be multiple evolutionary stages within each source."}
{"text":"We study the two-dimensional (2D) Ising model on square lattices with competing nearest-neighbor ferromagnetic interaction J1, next-nearest neighbor antiferromagnetic interaction J2, and external magnetic field H. We find that for small values of J2 there is no phase transition at finite temperature T in this system. However, when J2 increases beyond some critical value, we observe two successive transitions between paramagnetic state and ordered states as T decreases. The first-order transition line ends at tricritical point where second-order transition starts. In addition, we show that the ground-state energy per spin can be used to predict whether or not an array of \u03c0-rings will exhibit macroscopic degeneracy. Finally, by using the exact solution of 2D Ising model, we propose a new scheme for implementing adiabatic quantum computing which may lead to faster algorithms than those based on conventional methods. Two-dimensional Ising models have been studied extensively over past decades due to their rich physics and wide applications ranging from statistical mechanics [1] , condensed matter physics [2] , and biophysics [3] . Recently, it has also attracted much attention because of its potential use in designing efficient quantum computers [4] .\nIn this work, we consider the following Hamiltonian,\nwhere Sx = \u00b1 1 are classical spins located at each site x of a square lattice; J1 > 0 denotes the strength of nearest-neighbor ferromagnetic coupling while J2 < 0 represents the strength of next-nearest neighbor antifermomagnetic coupling.

It should be noted that our results remain valid even if one replaces the term \u2212J2Sx2Sy2 with \u2212J2(Sx1 + Sy1)(Sx2 + Sy2).

{"text":"We present the results on the super quantum mechanics (SQM) in dimer models with free fermion boundary conditions. We show that SQM is equivalent to the usual quantum mechanics for periodic boundary condition case. In addition we find that there are two different types of supersymmetric ground states depending on whether or not the number of particles N is even. For odd N , the ground state has zero energy but it does not have any degeneracy. On the other hand, when N is even, the ground state becomes doubly degenerate. The degeneracy can be understood by using the concept of parity symmetry breaking. Finally we discuss how our result fits into the general framework of supersymmetry.

As will become clear later, the supersymmetric structure changes drastically if one switches between periodic and free-fermion boundary conditions."}
{"text":"We present an analysis of the measurement process in quantum mechanics, which is based on the concept that it represents a final-state interaction between the system and macroscopic external measuring apparatuses. We show how this approach leads to a description of the measurement process in terms of wave function collapse, without introducing any additional ad hoc postulates or concepts such as state vector reduction. The proposed interpretation also provides a natural explanation for the appearance of classical properties during measurements performed on microscopic systems. In addition, we discuss some possible experimental tests of our theory. Introduction - Quantum mechanics (QM) has been developed over many decades into one of the most successful theories ever formulated by physicists [1] . However, despite its successes there are still several fundamental questions about QM that remain unanswered [2] , including what happens when a physical quantity is measured [3] ? This question lies at the heart of the problem of interpreting the results obtained in experiments involving quantum mechanical systems [4] .\nIn standard textbook treatments of quantum mechanics [5] , the measurement process is described using the von Neumann projection postulate [6] , according to which the outcome of a measurement can be predicted if the initial state of the system being investigated is known [7, 8] . According to this postulate, the result of a measurement depends only upon the observable being measured [9] . For example, consider a spin-1\/2 particle prepared in the state | \u2191> = 1 0 > + i0 -1 0 > \/ 2 [10] . If the spin component along the x-axis is measured then the probability of obtaining the value +1\/2 is given by: P(+1\/2) = <1 0|\u03c1|1 0> where \u03c1 is the density matrix describing the state of the particle [11] .

We use these data together with those for another 20 DLAs presented by Pettini et al. (1999) to investigate the chemical enrichment history of DLA galaxies over cosmic time. The main conclusions are as follows: \nThe abundance patterns observed in this sample can be explained if we assume that most of the metals were produced during an early burst of star formation which occurred less than 10 Gyr ago. \n\n\nThis is consistent with previous studies based on smaller samples but it also shows that there may not always be evidence for recent star formation activity even when such activity has been inferred from other indicators. \n\nIn addition, we find no correlation between metallicity and dust content or neutral hydrogen column density.\n\nFinally, we show that the mean value of [Fe\/H] measured in DLAs agrees well with the predictions made using simple models of galactic chemical evolution."}
{"text":"The human genome is organized into chromatin, which consists of DNA wrapped around histone proteins and other associated factors. The folding of the chromatin fiber plays an important role in regulating gene expression by controlling access of transcription machinery to genes. In this review we discuss recent advances on how chromatin folds at different levels (from single nucleosome to chromosome) and its relation with human genome function. We also introduce some new concepts such as \"topological domains\" and \"chromosome territories\" that are emerging from high-throughput technologies. Finally, we provide examples for future research directions. Chromatin is the basic unit of eukaryotic chromosomes consisting of DNA wrapped around histones and other associated factors.

{"text":"We study the functional renormalization group (FRG) approach to quantum phase transitions in systems of interacting nonrelativistic bosons, focusing on its application to fermionic superfluids and superconductors. We show that FRG is able to capture both the mean-field behavior at weak coupling as well as the strong-coupling physics beyond it. In particular we demonstrate how the FRG can be used to calculate the critical temperature Tc of the transition between normal state and superfluid\/superconducting states. The results are compared against those obtained by other methods such as Monte Carlo simulations or variational approaches. Finally, we discuss possible extensions of our work which could lead to further improvements. Quantum phase transitions occur when the ground-state properties of a system change abruptly upon varying some external parameter like pressure, magnetic field etc.. They have been studied extensively over many years using various theoretical techniques ranging from perturbative expansions around the Fermi liquid fixed point [1] , to numerical calculations based on exact diagonalizations [2] . Recently there has also been an increasing interest in applying the Functional Renormalization Group (FRG), originally developed within the context of strongly correlated electron systems [3] , to this problem [4] .\nIn this contribution we will focus on applications of the FRG method to fermionic superfluides and superconductors. These phases arise due to pairing correlations among fermions leading to macroscopic occupation of single-particle states below certain energy scale called the gap. This phenomenon is known as BCS-BEC crossover [5] where \"BCS\" stands for Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory [6] describing conventional s-wave superconductivity while \"BEC\" refers to Bose-Einstein condensation [7, 8] occurring in p-wave superfluids [9] . It turns out that these two limits correspond to different universality classes [10] so that one expects a smooth crossover between them [11] ."}

Keywords: Evolutionary Computation, Registration, Non-Rigid Transformation, Rigid Transformation, Brain Imaging, Computer Vision. 1 Introduction Image registration is one of the most fundamental tasks in many areas such as medical imaging [1] , remote sensing [2] , video processing [3] , etc., which aims to find a spatial transformation T that maps each point x \u2208 \u21261 = [0, 1]d into its corresponding location y = Tx \u2208 \u21262 = [0, 1]d in another image I(y). Here d denotes the dimension of the space. For example, if T1 and T2 denote two consecutive time points in a dynamic sequence of images then finding the optimal transformation T would allow us to track the movement of objects over time [4] . Similarly, if S1 and S2 represent two views of the same scene captured using cameras with slightly differing orientations then registering these images will help us fuse information across multiple viewpoints [5] .\nIn recent years there has been significant interest in developing fast and accurate registration algorithms [6] - [8] . However, despite considerable progress made towards solving this challenging problem [9] - [11] , it remains unsolved due to several factors including large number of degrees of freedom involved [12] , presence of noise [13] , partial occlusions [14] , lack of feature correspondence [15] , etc.."}

In this work we present the results for the EDM of Yb+ ions produced by laser cooling techniques at the Paul trap facility at the University of Bern.   We have measured the EDM with two different methods using either circularly polarized light or magnetic field gradients.  Our measurement yields a value of dYb+=(0.6 \u00b1 1.1 stat \u00b1 0.7 sys ) \u00d7 10\u221229 e cm where the systematic uncertainty has been reduced compared to previous measurements performed on Yb+ ions.  This result agrees well within uncertainties with theoretical predictions based on Standard Model calculations including nuclear structure corrections. A new experiment will start soon aiming at improving our current precision by one order of magnitude. The electric dipole moment (EDMs) are observables that can be used to probe fundamental symmetries like parity violation [1] . They are predicted to arise from CP-violating interactions beyond the standard model [2] , but their values are extremely small [3] .\nIn recent years there has been considerable interest in measuring EDMs of atoms [4] - [8] because they provide clean tests of fundamental theories [9] . Measurements of the electron EDM [10] - [12] yield upper limits on possible contributions from new particles [13] . On the other hand, experiments searching for permanent EDMs of nuclei [14] - [16] may lead to direct evidence of new sources of CP violation [17] .  Currently, most experimental efforts focus on heavy polarizable systems [18] - [20] since these offer higher sensitivity [21] ."}
{"text":"We present the results of cosmological simulations that follow the growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) by stochastic gas inflow, including radiative feedback effects on their surroundings. We find that SMBHs grow primarily through mergers with other BHs rather than gas accretion at high redshifts z > 6. At lower redshift we observe an increase in the fraction of mass gained via gas accretion relative to merger events. The resulting luminosity function is consistent with observations for both active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and quasars out to z = 7.5. Our model predicts a large number of low-luminosity AGNs which are not observed yet but may be detectable with future surveys such as LSST or Euclid. In addition, our model produces a population of obscured quasars whose properties agree well with recent observational constraints.

{"text":"We study the effective anisotropy constants, Keff , of an assembly of identical spherical particles in which each particle has uniaxial anisotropy along its easy axis (EA) that is tilted by an angle \u03b8 relative to the applied field direction.

For large values of \u03b8, we find that Keff decreases rapidly with increasing \u03b8 because of the reduction in the number density of particles having their EA parallel to H. The dependence of Keff on \u03b8 is found to agree well with experimental results obtained recently for FePt nanoparticles. \n \n In this work, we also calculate the activation energies associated with reversal processes involving rotation about different axes of the nanoparticle.

This method allows one to relate the values of the running coupling constant evaluated at different scales through perturbative corrections calculated as series expansions in powers of the coupling itself. It was shown that these relations can be used to extract information about the coupling at lower energy scales from its measured value at higher ones [2] , which makes it possible to perform precision tests of QCD theory over wide range of momenta [3] .\n \nThe main idea behind our analysis consists in comparing the experimentally observed properties of heavy quarks bound states - quarkonia - with their theoretically predicted counterparts.

Second, we obtain the mass spectra of charmonium resonances employing relativistic potential model [5] . Then, we compare both sets of theoretical predictions with corresponding experimental data [6] and adjust the parameters of the employed potential models until they reproduce all available experimental observations simultaneously [7, 8] .

{"text":"We show that the exchange-only optimized potentials (OEPs) are not equivalent to the Kohn-Sham (KS) method in general, even if one uses an exact density functional for the exchangecorrelation energy. We demonstrate this by solving analytically the OEPs for two simple model systems using Gaussian-type orbitals as basis functions. The results obtained within both approaches differ significantly. In particular, we find that the KS approach yields incorrect values for the total energies of these systems. This is due to the fact that the KS equations do not have solutions corresponding to all possible densities which can be generated by the given basis sets. On the other hand, the OEP formalism always provides unique solutions for any given density matrix. Our analysis shows also how to resolve the apparent paradox arising when trying to apply the OEP formalism to the case where only a limited number of basis functions is used."}

As a result, we discovered a gravitationally lensed object at redshift z = 1.62 consisting of three images produced by a foreground galaxy acting as a lens. Two of these images are located close together near the center of the lensing galaxy, whereas the third image lies far away from the lensing galaxy.

The total mass is estimated through gravitational lensing measurements performed on Hubble Space Telescope images. Our main findings are as follows:  1.

At z < 0.5 we measure fgas = Mgas\/Mtot = 0.11 \u00b1 0.01(stat.) \u00b10.02(sys.), where Mtot is the total gravitating mass within R500c, which corresponds to about half the virial radius.

{"text":"The Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (nuMSM) is an extension of the SM with three right-handed neutrinos and one additional Higgs doublet, which can explain simultaneously all known phenomena in particle physics. In this model there are two new particles - neutral leptons N_1 and N_2 that have not been observed yet experimentally. The aim of our work was to study possible production mechanisms for these particles at LHC energies. \nWe considered pair production of neutral leptons via Drell-Yan mechanism as well as single production through s-channel W-boson exchange or t-channel chargino\/neutralino exchanges. We performed numerical calculations using CalcHEP package. \n \n For the case of pair production we found that cross sections decrease rapidly when masses of neutral leptons increase. This fact makes it difficult to detect such particles at LHC experiments even if their mass difference is small. On the other hand, single production processes give much higher values of cross section than those obtained for pair production. However, they also depend strongly on the value of mixing angle between left- and righthanded neutrinos."}
{"text":"We report the itinerant-to-localized crossover of 5f electrons in an antiferromagnetically ordered and superconducting compound, UPd2Al3 (Tc = 3 K). The temperature dependence of electrical resistivity shows that the system undergoes a metal-insulator-like transition at TMI ~ 50 K with a large residual resistance ratio RRR = 300. This is accompanied by a change in the electronic structure as revealed by x-ray photoemission spectroscopy measurements. We find that the Fermi surface volume decreases rapidly below TMIl while the density-of-states near EF increases significantly. These results suggest that the magnetic ordering plays an important role for the formation of heavy fermion state in this material. Heavy-fermion compounds are characterized by their unique physical properties such as high specific heat coefficient \u03b3, enhanced Pauli susceptibility \u03c7p, and large effective mass m*. In these materials, strong hybridization between conduction electron states and localized 4f or 5f orbitals leads to the formation of heavy quasiparticles which give rise to many interesting phenomena including unconventional superconductivity1-5 . However, it has been difficult to understand how the local moments interact with each other because they often order magnetically at low temperatures6-8 .\nRecently, several new classes of heavy-fermion systems have been discovered9-12 , where the local moments do not order magnetically down to very low temperatures13-15 . For example, YbMgGaO16 does not show any sign of magnetic ordering down to 0.03 K14-16 . It was suggested that the lack of magnetic ordering may be due to quantum fluctuations caused by the proximity effect17-19 .

{"text":"We study the semiclassical dynamics of electrons in magnetic fields, which are described by the Dirac equation with spin-orbit coupling and Zeeman splitting. We show that the electron trajectories can be focused into narrow beams when their initial velocities have opposite directions along the field lines. This is due to an interference between two types of motion -the usual cyclotrons and the so-called \"Zitterbewegung\" oscillations-which leads to a beating pattern on top of the classical circular orbits. The latter type of motion arises because of the relativistic nature of the particles and its origin lies in the fact that the energy bands are spin split. Our results provide a new perspective for understanding the physics behind phenomena such as the quantum Hall effect or the integer quantum Hall effect at high Landau levels. \nI. INTRODUCTIO N\nThe transport properties of two-dimensional (2D) systems of interacting fermions under strong perpendicular magnetic fields have been studied extensively over many years [1] . In particular, it has been shown that the presence of a quantizing magnetic field gives rise to novel phases characterized by fractional filling factors [2] , where the number of filled Landau levels differs from the expected value [3] .\nIn this work we focus our attention on the case of non-interacting fermions moving in 2D space subject to a uniform magnetic field B = Be z [4] . For simplicity, we consider only one spin species; however, all our results remain valid if both spin projections are taken into account [5] .

{"text":"We present numerical simulations that show how magnetars can drive collimated outflows, which are observed as gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). We find that magnetic fields play an important role for driving GRB jets. The initial field configuration is crucial to determine whether or not the jet will be launched successfully. If the initial poloidal magnetic field lines are parallel with respect to each other at large distances from the central object, then they cannot launch a successful jet. However, if there exists some toroidal component of the magnetic field near the surface of the central object, then it may lead to launching a successful jet. In our simulation we have used a simple model for the initial magnetic field distribution around the central object. This model consists of two components; one is purely poloidal while another has both poloidal and toroidal components.

We find that the best-fit value of this quantity is consistent with the predictions based on standard CDM models if one assumes that most of the baryonic component of these systems resides within galaxies rather than being distributed throughout the intracluster medium (ICM). This result suggests that the ICM may be heated by some mechanism other than gravity alone. \n \n Keywords: Galaxy cluster, Dark Matter Halo, Gravitational Lensing, Mass-to-Light Ratio, X-Ray Emission \n \n \n \n 1 Introduction \n \n The study of galaxy clusters has been instrumental to our understanding of cosmology over the past few decades. In fact, it was through observations of galaxy clusters that we first discovered evidence supporting the existence of non-baryonic dark matter [1] . Today, galaxy clusters are still used extensively to test theories about structure formation [2] , and they provide important constraints on cosmological parameters such as the Hubble constant [3] or the equation-of-state parameter w [4] . \n \n However, despite all its successes, there remain several open questions regarding galaxy clusters which have yet to be answered satisfactorily. For example, while current observational techniques allow us to measure accurately the total amount of light emitted by a galaxy cluster, it remains difficult to determine how much of this light comes from stars inside individual galaxies versus diffuse gas located outside them [5] . Similarly, although we can estimate fairly well the total gravitating mass of a galaxy cluster using various methods [6] , it is not clear what fraction of this mass is associated with visible objects like galaxies [7, 8] . Finally, even though we know that galaxy clusters contain large amounts of hot plasma [9] , it is unclear whether this material is gravitationally bound to the system [10] .\n \nIn order to address these issues, we will use two different datasets obtained from the Chandra Observatory [11] : the sample of galaxy clusters studied by Vikhlinin et"}

We demonstrate how GAs can be used to evolve optimal agent behaviours within a simulated environment where each agent has different capabilities. The results show that our method improves upon existing approaches by increasing the overall efficiency of the system while reducing the number of messages required between agents. This research was funded by EPSRC grant EP\/G066058\/1. Agent-based computing is increasingly being applied to problems requiring autonomous decision-making and\/or learning [1] . Examples include intelligent transportation [2] , smart grids [3] , healthcare [4] , manufacturing [5] , robotics [6] , and military operations [7] .\nHowever, there are several challenges associated with developing these types of systems [8] . One particular challenge relates to scalability as the number of agents increases [9] . For example, if one thousand agents need to make decisions on their own then it may not be possible to develop individualised behavioural models for all of them [10] . Instead, they must rely on some form of collective intelligence [11] which requires communication [12] . If too much information is communicated between agents then the network will become overloaded [13] resulting in poor performance [14] . Therefore, it becomes important to minimise the amount of data transmitted across the network [15] whilst still maintaining high levels of performance [16] .\nIn order to address these issues, researchers have proposed various techniques [17] ranging from simple heuristics [18] to sophisticated machine-learning methods [19] . These techniques typically involve either centralised [20] or decentralised [21] control mechanisms [22] . Centralised control involves a single entity controlling all aspects of the system [23] whereas decentralised control allows multiple entities to act independently [24] ."}

Among these techniques, Finite Element (FE)\nModeling plays an essential role since it provides numerical solutions to complex engineering problems [2] .\nHowever, due to uncertainties involved in material properties, boundary conditions, geometric imperfections etc., there are always discrepancies between theoretical predictions based on FE models and actual measurements [3] , especially when dealing with large scale civil infrastructures [4] . Therefore, it becomes necessary to update the FE models so that they can accurately predict the dynamic behavior of real structures [5] .\nIn recent years, many researchers have developed different approaches to perform FE model updating [6] - [8] . Generally speaking, most existing studies focus on two main aspects [9] : one is how to formulate the objective function; another is how to find optimal parameters within the feasible region. For example, some authors use frequency responses [10] , mode shapes [11] , natural frequencies [12] , or their combination [13] as the objective functions.

For example, [2] considers joint subcarrier and bit allocations among users in orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)-based broadband wireless networks using Lagrangian relaxation techniques; [3] proposes a distributed algorithm based on dual decomposition theory to solve the sum-power minimization problem subject to rate constraints in OFDMA cellular networks; [4] develops a low-complexity iterative water-filling algorithm to optimize the tradeoff between spectral efficiency and fairness in multi-cell OFDMA networks. However, these works do not consider user-specific delay requirements which may be important in some applications like voice communications. To address this issue, [5] presents a cross-layer design framework where packet scheduling decisions are made jointly across physical layer, MAC layer, and application layer according to both channel conditions and end-to-end delay requirements. [6] studies the problem of maximizing the weighted sum-rate of all users in a single-cell uplink scenario with per-user delay constraints. It shows that the resulting optimization problem is NP-hard and then solves it via convex programming methods.

In particular we find that the entropy density scales like $T_3$ near the horizon while it behaves like $T^2$ far away from the horizon. This implies that there exists a phase transition between these two phases. The critical point where they meet is determined by solving numerically the equation of state.

However, at large bias voltage differences we find significant deviations which can be attributed to the fact that the DMRG method is not able to capture all relevant physics correctly when applied directly to the full system. The main advantage of the DMRG technique lies in its ability to provide accurate results even if only relatively short chains have to be considered."}
{"text":"The heat capacity of lead sulfide (PbS) has been measured in the temperature range 1.8 to 300 K using adiabatic calorimetry and compared with that for lead selenide (PbSe). The results show that, at low temperatures, the heat capacities are dominated by phonon contributions which can be described within Debye theory. At higher temperatures, anharmonic effects become important leading to deviations between experiment and theory. In addition, we find evidence for isotopic effects on both lattice and electronic properties.  These findings suggest that the use of lead chalcogenides as thermoelectric materials may require careful consideration of their thermal stability. Lead chalcogenides have attracted considerable interest recently due to their potential applications in thermoelectrics [1-3]. However, there is still much debate about how these compounds behave under different conditions [4] . This is partly because it is difficult to measure accurately the physical properties such as electrical conductivity or Seebeck coefficient over large ranges of temperature and doping concentration [5] .\nIn this work, we report measurements of the specific heat capacity of two samples of lead sulfide (one natural abundance sample and one enriched in the heavier isotopes 206Pb and 207Pb), together with theoretical calculations based on density functional theory [6] , in order to investigate the effect of isotopic composition on the thermodynamic properties of lead chalcogenide semiconductors [7-9]. We also compare our experimental data with those obtained previously for lead selenide [10] .  Our results demonstrate that the isotopic composition affects not only the lattice but also the electronic contribution to the total heat capacity."}

{"text":"We study the zero-lag synchronization between two identical chaotic systems with different time scales by using dynamical relaying method, which is based on introducing an intermediate system to transmit information between them. The stability analysis shows that the proposed scheme can achieve zero-lag synchronization under some conditions. Numerical simulations are performed for Lorenz and Chen systems as examples. It is shown that the proposed scheme has advantages over other existing methods in terms of robustness against parameter mismatch and external disturbances. \nI. INTRODUCTIO N\nSynchronization plays important roles in many fields such as biology [1] , physics [2] , engineering [3] . In recent years, chaos synchronization [4] - [6] has attracted much attention due to its potential applications in secure communication [7] , chemical reactions [8] , biological systems [9] .\nChaos synchronization was first studied by Pecora and Carroll [10] who introduced the concept of master-slave synchronization. Since then, various schemes have been developed [11] - [13] . Among these schemes, adaptive control [14] , active control [15] , backstepping [16] , sliding mode [17] , fuzzy logic [18] , impulsive control [19] , intermittent control [20] , pinning control [21] , etc., were widely used [22] - [24] . However, most of these works focused only on the case where there exists no delay between slave and master systems [25] - [27] . Recently, several studies have investigated the problem of synchronizing chaotic systems with time delays [28] - [30] . For example, Wu et al. [31] presented a new approach to realize lag-synchronized chaos between two chaotic systems with different dimensions through state feedback controllers. Liu et al. [32] designed a novel delayed-feedback controller to synchronize two chaotic systems with unknown parameters. Wang et al. [33] proposed a simple but effective method to synchronize two chaotically oscillating systems with time-varying delays. Although these results provide useful insights into the design of synchronized chaotic systems with time-delays, they cannot be applied directly to solve practical problems because it may take too"}
{"text":"We present an explicit calculation of the non-perturbative renormalisation constant for the chromomagnetic operator in heavy quark effective theory (HQET). We use this to calculate the leading order contribution to the mass difference between the ground state vector mesons containing a b-quark, i.e., $B^*$- $B$ mixing. The result is compared with lattice QCD calculations at next-to-leading order in HQET perturbation theory. Our results are consistent within errors but do not agree as well as one would like. This may be due to missing higher-order corrections or systematic uncertainties inherent in both approaches. \n \n Introduction \n \n In recent years there has been considerable interest in studying hadronic systems containing a single heavy quark using the framework provided by heavy quark effective theory (HQT) [1] . One important application of HQT is to study the properties of heavy-light mesons such as the bottomonium system [2] , which can then be used to test our understanding of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics [3] .\n \nIn particular, it is interesting to consider how the masses of these states depend on their spin.

The results are consistent with previous studies which found no significant correlations between Lyman-alpha luminosity function and 21 cm brightness temperature fluctuations at z = 6 \u2212 7. \n \n Keywords: Hydrogen line radiation, Radiation transfer, Reionization, Simulations, Galaxy evolution \n \n 1 Introduction \n \n In recent years there has been growing interest in studying the relationship between galaxy properties such as their star formation rates (SFRs), stellar masses, morphologies etc., and the underlying dark matter halos they reside within. This is motivated by the fact that understanding this connection will help us understand how galaxies evolve over cosmic time. For example, it may be possible to use observations of galaxy clustering statistics to constrain models for galaxy formation and evolution. However, these measurements can only provide statistical information about the average properties of large samples of galaxies. To obtain more detailed information on individual objects we need to study them individually. One way to do so is through direct imaging techniques like Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Another method involves measuring the fluxes emitted by different atomic species via spectroscopic methods. These include optical\/UV lines produced by ionized atoms, infrared lines produced by warm dust grains heated by young stars, radio continuum emission due to synchrotron processes associated with supernova remnants, free-free emission arising from HII regions surrounding hot massive stars, and finally the most important tracer - the 21-cm hyperfine transition of neutral hydrogen (HI). \n \n HI traces all cold neutral gas in the interstellar medium (ISM) including both molecular clouds and diffuse atomic gas.

{"text":"We study the dynamical stability properties of rapidly-rotating, axisymmetric neutron star models with different equations of state (EOS). We find that for all EOS considered here, there is an instability associated to the presence of toroidal magnetic fields which can be excited by differential rotation between core and crust regions. The growth timescale of this instability ranges from 10-100 ms depending on the strength of the field and the degree of differential rotation present initially. \n \n This instability may have important consequences for magnetar flares as well as for the spin evolution of young pulsars. In particular we show how it could lead to rapid spindowns during the first few hundred milliseconds after birth if the initial conditions are such that the unstable mode has a large enough amplitude.

{"text":"Magnetic separation is an important tool in biomedical research and clinical diagnostics, but it has been limited to macroscopic devices that are not suitable for point-of-care applications. Here we report on continuous magnetophoresis-based blood cell sorting using microfluidics. We demonstrate efficient separation of red blood cells (RBCs) from plasma by applying a magnetic field gradient across a microchannel containing RBCs suspended in buffer solution. The results show that our method can be used as a simple yet effective approach for separating different types of blood cells with high purity and efficiency. This work may have significant implications towards developing portable diagnostic tools based on microscale blood processing technologies. Magnetic separation techniques play an important role in many fields including medicine, biotechnology, environmental science, food industry etc., [1] . However, most existing methods require bulky equipment which makes them unsuitable for use outside laboratory settings [2] .\nRecently there has been growing interest in miniaturizing these systems into lab-on-a-chip platforms [3] , where various functionalities such as sample preparation [4] , chemical analysis [5] , drug delivery [6] , and bioassays [7] could be integrated onto one single chip. In particular, magnetic separators have attracted much attention due to their simplicity, low cost, portability, and compatibility with other microfabricated components [8] . For example, several groups have demonstrated magnetic separation of biological samples inside microchannels [9] - [11] or on planar surfaces [12] - [14] . Despite this progress, however, current approaches still suffer from some limitations. First, they typically rely on batch-wise operation mode [15] , which limits throughput and requires large volumes of input samples [16] . Second, the majority of reported designs only allow for separation between two distinct populations [17] , while more complex mixtures involving multiple species cannot be processed simultaneously [18] . Third, the fabrication process usually involves complicated multi-step procedures [19] , making it difficult to integrate additional functions [20] .

{"text":"We present an analysis of the power spectrum of galaxy clusters in the MaxBCG catalogue, using data obtained by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We find that the observed power spectrum is consistent with theoretical predictions based on linear perturbation theory and numerical simulations. The shape of the measured power spectrum agrees well with the prediction at large scales k < 0.1 h\/Mpc but deviates significantly at smaller scales. This deviation can be explained as due to nonlinear effects such as baryonic physics or gravitational lensing magnification bias. In addition we detect two prominent peaks around $k\\sim0.05$ and $0.1$h\/Mpc which are likely caused by acoustic oscillations during inflationary epoch. These results provide further support for the standard cosmological model. Introduction Galaxy clusters play important roles in many areas of astrophysics including cosmology [1-3]. They contain thousands of galaxies within their virial radii and thus represent some of the most massive gravitationally bound structures known in our universe [4] . Their abundance has been used to constrain cosmological parameters such as dark energy equation-of-state parameter w [5-7] , neutrino mass [8-10] and primordial non-Gaussianity [11-13] .\nThe number density distribution of galaxy clusters depends sensitively on the underlying cosmological model [14-16] . Therefore it provides another powerful probe into the nature of dark matter [17] , gravity [18] and cosmic acceleration [19-21] .

We show that if the manifold is not locally symmetric then there exists an open set of initial conditions for which the 2-frame flow does not converge to its associated geodesic flow as time goes to infinity (Theorem 1).  In particular we prove this result when the manifold has strictly negative sectional curvatures everywhere but at one point where it vanishes identically (Corollary 2). As another application of our results, we give examples of closed 3-manifolds whose fundamental groups are infinite index subgroups of arithmetic lattices in $SO(3)$ (Proposition 3).\nIntroduction\n\nLet $M$ be a complete connected Riemannian n-manifold without conjugate points such that $\\text{sec}M<0$ almost everywhere.

Thus, the 2-frame flow preserves the second fundamental form of any given immersion.  This property allows us to use"}

{"text":"We present new astrometric measurements for the candidate exoplanet companion to HD 33636, obtained with the Fine Guidance Sensor (FGS) on board the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). These data are combined with previously published radial velocities in order to determine the mass of this object. We find that it is most likely an M dwarf star with a mass between 0.3 and 1.0 times that of Jupiter's mass. The orbital parameters derived here agree well with those determined by previous authors using different techniques. This system may be similar to our own solar system at early stages of formation when planets were still forming around young stars. Keywords: Extrasolar planet -Astrometry -Radial velocity -HST -Mass determination -HD 33636 . \nIntroduction\n\nThe detection of extrasolar giant planets has been one of the major accomplishments of modern astronomy over the past decade. However, only about 10% of all known planetary systems contain such massive objects. Most of these have been discovered through high-precision Doppler spectroscopy or direct imaging methods. In contrast, very few low-mass companions have been found so far because they produce smaller reflex motions and\/or lower luminosity than their more massive counterparts. As a result, there exists a large gap in the distribution of masses among known extra-solar planets ranging from several Earth masses down to Neptune-like masses. It is therefore important to search for low-mass companions as well since they can provide valuable information regarding the formation process of planetary systems. \n \n One possible way to detect low-mass companions is to use high-angular resolution observations made with space-based telescopes like HST. Such observations allow us to measure the position angle of the host star relative to its nearby neighbors. If we assume that the observed motion is due solely to gravitational interaction with another body then we can derive the projected separation and position angle of the companion. By combining these results with accurate radial-velocity measurements taken simultaneously, we can obtain the full three-dimensional orbit of the companion which allows us to calculate its mass."}
{"text":"We report the detection of cosmic far-infrared background (CFIRB) fluctuations using deep observations made by the Far Infrared Surveyor (FIS) onboard Akari satellite at 65 and 90 micron bands in the Lockman Hole field, which is one of the most sensitive fields for detecting extragalactic sources.

After removing bright point-like objects detected by Spitzer\/MIPS 24 micron survey, we performed aperture photometry on all remaining pixels within an area of 1 deg2 centered around the Lockman hole. To estimate the contribution from Galactic cirrus emission, we subtracted the median value of each pixel after applying a 3 sigma clipping method.

In addition we provide an explicit expression for the four-loop amplitude in terms of harmonic polylogarithms. Our results agree with those obtained by other groups using different methods. \n \n 1 Introduction \n \n Maximally supersymmetric gauge theories are interesting because they can be solved exactly both perturbatively and non-perturbatively. They have been studied extensively over many years [1] . Recently there has been renewed interest in these theories due to the discovery that certain observables exhibit unexpectedly simple behavior when computed in perturbation theory [2] , which may shed light on the structure of quantum gravity [3] .\n \nIn this letter we report our calculation of maximally supersymmetric planar (N=4) Yang-Mills amplitudes in the large $N$ limit [4] up to five loops. This includes all finite contributions and their dependence on the regularization scale $\\mu$. These results were first presented in [5] where some details about the computation will also be found. \nThe motivation behind studying such theories comes from string theory [6] . Indeed, it was shown recently [7, 8] that the scattering amplitudes of open strings ending on D-branes in type IIB string theory reduce to maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills amplitudes in ten dimensions upon compactification down to six dimensions. Moreover, the same amplitudes appear in M-theory [9] after compactifying eleven-dimensional supergravity on a torus [10] . It follows then that any progress made towards understanding the properties of maximally supersymmetric Yang Mills theories should help us understand better the dynamics of string\/M-theories."}

{"text":"We consider the problem of scheduling precedence constrained tasks on parallel machines with uncertain processing times, where each task has an associated probability distribution over its execution time and we are interested in minimizing expected makespan.  We show that this problem is NP-hard even for two identical parallel machines and unit-length jobs (i.e., all job lengths equal one). For the special case when there exists at least one deterministic schedule whose makespan does not exceed twice the optimal value, we present a polynomial-time algorithm to compute such a schedule. Finally, we propose several heuristics based on local search techniques and compare their performance through extensive computational experiments. Scheduling problems involving uncertainty have been studied extensively in recent years due to various practical applications including manufacturing systems, computer networks, transportation systems etc. (see e.g., [1\u20133]).  In many real-world situations, it may be difficult or impossible to accurately estimate the exact duration required by different activities prior to starting them. As a result, these durations can only be predicted within certain ranges using statistical models [4]. The objective function considered in most existing studies is either to minimize the total completion time [5\u20137] or the maximum lateness [8\u201310]. However, in some cases, it might also be desirable to optimize other objectives like cost [11\u201313], reliability [14\u201318], tardiness [19, 20], earliness\/tardiness [21], weighted flowtime [22], number of late jobs [23], etc.."}
{"text":"We present results on isospin symmetry breaking effects for the ground states and excited states of the mirror nuclei 14Be, 14B, 14C, and 14N using the shell model with realistic interactions.

The predicted excitation energies of the first 2+ state in 14Be agree well with those obtained by other theoretical calculations but differ significantly from experiments. This discrepancy may be due to missing three-body forces or possibly because our calculation does not include any explicit treatment of the continuum. Our results show that the effect of Coulomb interaction plays only minor role in determining the properties of these nuclei. In addition, we have studied the dependence of the calculated results on different single-particle wave functions used as input into the shell-model diagonalization procedure."}
{"text":"We show that any physical realization of the quantum NOT gate must be accompanied by an energy cost, which is bounded below by a universal constant times the number of qubits in the system. This result follows directly from our proof of the existence of a lower bound on the ground-state energy density of certain spin systems with competing interactions and open boundary conditions. Our results are relevant to recent efforts aimed at realizing large-scale quantum computers using solid state devices such as semiconductor quantum dots or trapped ions. We also discuss possible extensions of this work to other types of quantum gates. The ability to perform arbitrary unitary transformations on a set of n qubits would constitute a quantum computer capable of solving problems exponentially faster than classical computers [1] . However, it has been shown [2] that no quantum algorithm can solve all computational problems more efficiently than its best known classical counterpart unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses. Thus, practical quantum computing requires efficient methods for implementing only those algorithms whose solutions cannot be found classically [3] .\nIn order to implement these algorithms, one needs to be able to perform basic operations such as single-qubit rotations [4] , two-qubit entangling gates [5] , and measurements [6] . In particular, the so-called CNOT (controlled-NOT) gate plays a central role [7, 8] since it allows one to construct many important quantum circuits [9] . Unfortunately, there exists no known method for constructing a general CNOT gate [10] ; however, several proposals have recently emerged [11] - [16] . These schemes typically involve coupling the spins of individual atoms via magnetic fields [17] and\/or optical cavities [18] .

{"text":"We study the crossover between two different regimes of charge dynamics at finite temperatures, which are separated by a quantum phase transition (QPT) driven by disorder and interactions. The QPT separates an insulating state with localized pairs into a metallic state where pairs delocalize over macroscopic distances. We show that this QPT is accompanied by a sharp change in the low-temperature behavior of the electrical conductivity $\\Sigma$(T). In particular, we find that for $T \\ll T_c$, where $T_c$ denotes the characteristic energy scale associated to the QPT, $\\Sigma$(T) exhibits activated behavior as expected for insulators. However, when $T$ becomes comparable or larger than $T_c$, $\\Sigma$($T$) crosses over towards a power-law dependence on temperature, indicating the presence of gapless excitations. This crossover can be understood within a phenomenological model based on the interplay between elastic scattering off impurities and electron-electron interaction effects. \n \n Introduction \n \n Quantum phase transitions occur at zero temperature due to competition among various ground states. They have been studied extensively both theoretically and experimentally [1] . Recently there has been growing interest in understanding how these phenomena manifest themselves at finite temperatures [2] , especially since many materials exhibit interesting properties only close to their respective quantum critical points [3] . For example, it was recently shown [4] that the resistivity of SrTiO3 undergoes a non-Fermi liquid like scaling behavior around its quantum critical point [5] . Another recent experiment [6] showed that the Hall coefficient of CeCoIn5 displays a non-monotonic temperature dependence across its magnetic quantum critical point [7, 8] . These experiments suggest that the physics of quantum criticality may play an important role in determining the electronic properties of correlated systems such as high-Tc cuprates [9] . \n \n Here we consider another class of quantum phase transitions occurring in strongly interacting fermionic systems [10] : those driven by disorder and interactions [11] .

{"text":"We study how the properties of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) affect their radio morphologies, and in particular whether they can explain the observed difference between Fanaroff-Riley type I (FRI) and II (FRII).

The resulting jets are simulated using relativistic magnetohydrodynamics with an adiabatic index of 4\/3. Our results show that FRIs have lower jet powers than FRIIs for similar BH masses because of differences in the accretion rate onto the central BH. This is consistent with observations showing that FRIs typically reside in less massive galaxies compared to FRIIs. In addition, we find that FRIs produce more collimated jets due to higher magnetic field strengths close to the BH horizon."}

We find that its spectral shape can be well described by a power law with photon index \u0393 = 2.1 \u00b1 0.2 plus two thermal components; one component has temperature kT = 0.3 +0.4 \u22120.1 keV while another has higher temperature kT = 3.7 +1.6 \u22121.1 keV. The luminosity ratio between these two thermal components is L h \/L l \u2248 5.9 +2.8 \u22122.1 . In addition to this multi-component continuum model, we also include several emission lines such as Fe K\u03b1 line and OVII triplet. Our best-fit parameters are consistent with those obtained previously using ASCA data. \n \n Using the Chandra HETG observation taken during 2001-2002, we have investigated the short-term variability behavior of CIV 1549. We found no significant time lag between different energy bands within the observed bandpasses. However, there appears to exist some correlation between flux variations in hard energies (> 4 keV) and those in softer energies (< 4 keV), although it does not appear to be strictly linear relationship. This result suggests that the origin of the short-term variability may be due to reprocessing of harder photons into softer ones rather than intrinsic fluctuations of the primary source itself. \n \n Finally, we examine whether or not CIV 1549 shows any evidence for rapid aperiodic variability. By applying wavelet transform techniques to the light curve extracted from the central region of the galaxy, we detect strong signals corresponding to periods ranging from 10 - 100 s. These periodicities are most likely associated with quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs). \n \n We conclude that CIV 1549 is probably powered by accretion onto supermassive black holes."}
{"text":"We study the chiral properties of baryon interpolating fields in lattice QCD with two flavors of dynamical quarks using overlap fermions and Wilson gauge action at several values of quark masses ranging from light to heavy.  We find that the axial vector current is conserved for all three types of interpolating fields, i.e., local ($\\pi^0$), smeared-local ($\\Delta^{++}$) and smeared-smeared ($\\Sigma^{+}$). The scalar density does not have good chiral behavior even though it has been improved by adding one-link terms. This may be due to the fact that we use only nearest neighbor links as sources for the scalar density operator.

{"text":"We study the Hall effect for an axisymmetric magnetic field in a dense plasma with degenerate electrons and non-degenerate ions, which is relevant to the interior of a neutron star. We find that the Hall current density depends on the direction of the magnetic field relative to the rotation vector $\\boldsymbol{\\omega}$ as well as its magnitude. The dependence on the direction arises because the electron velocity distribution function becomes anisotropic due to the Lorentz force exerted by the magnetic field. This leads to a difference between the longitudinal and transverse conductivities even when the magnetic field is parallel to the rotation vector. In addition, we show that the Hall conductivity tensor has off-diagonal components if the magnetic field is not aligned with the rotation vector. These results are obtained using kinetic theory combined with the relaxation-time approximation. \nThe Hall effect plays an important role in various astrophysical phenomena such as pulsar winds and magnetars. It also affects the evolution of the magnetic field inside a neutron star through Ohmic dissipation. \n \n Neutron stars have extremely strong magnetic fields ($10^{14}-10^{16}\\text{ G}$) at their surfaces [1] . Their interiors contain superfluid neutrons, superconducting protons, and degenerate electrons [2] , all of which can be strongly influenced by the magnetic field [3] . For example, it was recently shown [4] that the presence of a toroidal magnetic field causes the crustal lattice structure of a neutron star to become unstable against shear deformations. Therefore, understanding how these different physical ingredients interact with each other under extreme conditions is crucial for modeling realistic neutron stars."}
{"text":"We propose an explicit microscopic model for the recently proposed massive CP$^1$ theory, which is based on the idea that the Higgs field arises as a collective mode in strongly correlated systems with spontaneously broken symmetry.  We show how this can be realized by considering a system of fermions coupled to bosonic degrees of freedom via a four-fermion interaction term and derive the effective action for the Higgs field. The resulting Higgs potential has two degenerate minima corresponding to the vacuum expectation values $\\langle H \\rangle = \\pm v_0$ where $v_0 \\sim J$ (the strength of the coupling between the fermions and bosons) and $J > 0$ is determined self-consistently within our approach. In addition we find that there are no massless excitations associated with the Higgs field. Finally, we discuss possible experimental realizations of such a scenario using cold atoms or trapped ions. Introduction - Recently it was suggested [1] that the Standard Model Higgs field may arise as a collective mode in a class of strongly correlated systems with spontaneusly broken symmetry. This proposal relies on the observation [2] that the Higgs mechanism can be understood as arising from the condensation of bound states of fermions into bosonic particles [3] . It follows then that if one could engineer a system of fermions interacting with some other degree(s) of freedom so that these bound states condense, then one would have spontaneous breaking of gauge symmetry and hence a Higgs-like state. A concrete realization of this idea was given in Ref. [4] , where it was shown that the Higgs field emerges naturally when one considers a system of fermions with spin-1\/2 coupled to bosonic degrees"}

For both cases, we show how to find an optimal schedule by solving a sequence of linear programs. Our results hold even if there exists only one receiver per transmitter.

{"text":"We present measurements of the inclusive neutral current cross section for events with three or more jets, as well as the differential jet multiplicity distribution and the transverse momentum distributions of the leading two jets, using data collected by H1 during 1994-2000 corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 0.5 fb-1. The results are compared to predictions based on next-to-leading order QCD calculations including parton showers matched to matrix elements (NLO+PS). Good agreement is observed between theory and experiment over most kinematic regions studied. In particular we find that NLO+PS describes both the normalisation and shape of the measured multijet cross sections very well. \n \n We also compare our results to those obtained previously by ZEUS which were published in 2002.

{"text":"We study spin effects on the lattice QCD using recurrence lattices (RL) with multi-site exchanges, which are constructed by applying the RL transformation to the original fermion action. We show that the spin dependence is suppressed for large quark masses but not completely removed even at mq = 5 GeV. The residual spin dependence can be reduced further if we use larger number of sites in the exchange term. In this work, we adopt Ns = 4 as an example. We also find that the spin dependent part of the effective potential has no imaginary part up to O(a^4). This implies that there exists no spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry due to spin effects within our framework. Finally, we discuss possible extensions of our method. PACS numbers: 11.15.Ha, 12.38.Gc, 13 .25.Hw \nI. INTRODUCTORY REMARK\nIn recent years, it was found that the standard Wilson-type fermions suffer from severe problems such as the so-called species doubling problem [1] , the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem [2] , and the Gribov copy problem [3] . These difficulties have been overcome by introducing new types of fermionic actions [4] - [8] .\nThe most popular one among them is probably the overlap-Dirac operator [9] , whose eigenfunctions satisfy the Ginsparg-Wilson relation [10] . However, its numerical cost grows rapidly when the lattice volume becomes large because the inverse of the Dirac operator must be calculated exactly. To reduce the computational costs, several approximate methods were proposed [11] - [13] . Among these approaches, the Neuberger overlap operator [14] seems to be the best choice so far [15] .\nAnother promising approach is based on the idea of the exact renormalization group [16] . It was shown [17] that the fermion determinant detD(\u03bc), where D(\u03bc) denotes the fermion matrix defined through the fermion action Sf [U] \u2261 \u2211x Tr[\u03b3\u03bcD(\u03bc)Ux], satisfies the following flow equation:"}

Our results show that we are able to recover the true source distribution accurately even if only few measurements are available. Furthermore, we compare our method against state-of-the-art algorithms and find that our approach outperforms them significantly when the number of measurement locations is small. Finally, we apply our method to real-world data obtained during a field experiment at the University of Houston's Space Research Center. This dataset consists of temperature measurements taken inside a building after a fire was started near one of its walls."}
{"text":"We study the charge ordering phenomena in one-dimensional solids by using the exact diagonalization method and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) technique. We find that there are two types of charge orderings, i.e., stripe-like and checkerboard-like orders depending on the electron filling factor n. The former is realized for 0 < n < 1 while the latter appears at half-filling with spin degeneracy lifted. In addition to these ordered states we also observe an exotic state where electrons form pairs without any net charge. This paired state can be regarded as a precursor of superconductivity. Finally, we discuss possible experimental realizations of our results. Introduction:-In recent years much attention has been paid to the physics of low dimensional systems such as carbon nanotubes [1] , semiconductor nanowires [2] , quantum wires [3] etc.. These materials have attracted considerable interest because they provide us with unique opportunities to explore novel physical properties which cannot exist in conventional three-dimensional bulk materials [4] . For example, it was predicted theoretically [5] and observed experimentally [6] that carbon nanotubes show metallic behavior even though their diameter is comparable or smaller than the Fermi wavelength. Another interesting feature of low dimensional systems is that various kinds of electronic phases may appear due to strong correlation effects [7, 8] .\nOne of the most important issues in this field is how to control the electronic phase diagram of low dimensional systems. It should be noted here that the electronic structure strongly depends not only on the geometry but also on the chemical composition [9] . Therefore, if we could change the chemical composition of low dimensional systems, then we would expect new electronic phases to emerge. Recently, several groups succeeded in synthesizing low dimensional compounds whose chemical compositions were controlled precisely [10 -12] . As a result, many fascinating phenomena have been discovered [13 -19] ."}
{"text":"The space elevator is an important project in the future space exploration, which can provide transportation between Earth orbit and ground with high efficiency. The electrostatic climber (EC) is one key component of the space elevator system that will be used to transport passengers or cargoes up and down along the cable. In this work, we present a novel design concept of EC based on the principle of electrodynamic levitation. A prototype has been built according to our proposed design. It consists of two main parts: the upper platform and lower platform. The upper platform contains four permanent magnets arranged in square shape; while the lower platform includes eight coils connected in series. The experimental results show that the maximum lift force generated by the EC reaches about 1 N at the current density of 0.5 A\/mm2 . This value meets the requirement of the space elevator application. Moreover, it also shows good stability when the load changes."}
{"text":"We show that the answer to this question is no, at least in principle. We consider two models for dark energy which are observationally indistinguishable but have different physical origins; one is due to vacuum fluctuations while the other arises as an effective field theory description of quantum gravity effects. In both cases there exists a parameter space where the predictions for the evolution of the universe agree with current observations within experimental uncertainties. However, if future experiments can measure the equation-of-state of dark energy more accurately then it may be possible to differentiate these two scenarios. The discovery of cosmic acceleration has led to much interest in the possibility that our universe contains some form of \"dark energy\"; see e.g., [1] . This exotic component would drive the expansion of the universe today and dominate its dynamics on large scales. A number of theoretical proposals exist for what such a dark energy might consist of (see [2] for a review). One particularly interesting class of possibilities involves introducing new fields into Einstein's equations whose presence leads to repulsive gravitational forces [3] .\nIn recent years many authors have studied the phenomenology associated with various forms of dark energy; see [4] - [8] , [10] - [12] , [14] - [16] , [18] - [20] , [22] - [26] , [28] - [30] , [32] - [38] , [41] - [44] , [46] - [48] , [50] - [52] , [54] - [61] , [63] - [65] , [67] - [71] , [73] - [75] , [77] - [81] , [83] - [85] , [88] - [92] , [94] - [103] . Many of these works focus on comparing specific models against observational data or studying their implications for fundamental physics. Here we take a complementary approach by considering whether any two distinct models could give rise to identical observable consequences."}

{"text":"We study the classical counterparts of macroscopic tunneling phenomena, which are observed in many-body systems with competing interactions. We consider an ensemble of interacting particles on a ring threaded by a magnetic flux. The competition between nearest-neighbor attraction and next-to-nearest neighbor repulsion leads to the formation of localized states (breathers) that can be either pinned or mobile depending on their energy. In particular we show how these breather solutions evolve into spatially extended structures when they become unstable due to collisions with other breathers. Finally, we discuss the possibility for such excitations to form stable bound states. This work is supported by NSF grant DMR-0704520. PACS numbers: 05.45.Mt, 02.10.Yn, 11.30.Pb, 03.65.Nk . \nI. INTRODUCTORY REMARK\nMacroscopic tunneling refers to the phenomenon where a large number of microscopic degrees of freedom coherently contribute to transport across potential barriers [1] , leading to novel physical effects like superfluidity [2] , Josephson effect [3] , Bose-Einstein condensation [4] , etc.. Macroscopic tunneling has been studied extensively both theoretically [5] - [8] as well as experimentally [9] - [11] .\nIn this manuscript we present results concerning the classical counterpart of macroscopic quantum tunneling [12] . More specifically, we investigate the properties of a system consisting of N identical particles moving along a one-dimensional ring threaded by a constant magnetic field. Each particle interacts with its two neighbors via repulsive potentials while it experiences attractive forces from all remaining particles. Such a model was introduced originally by Calogero [13] who showed that the ground state consists of equally spaced particles forming a Wigner crystal [14] . It turns out that the presence of a weak external periodic driving force breaks the translational symmetry of the lattice [15] , giving rise to new types of collective excitations [16] . These excitations have been shown to exhibit features similar to those found in macroscopic quantum tunneling [17] - [20] . For example, if the amplitude of the external drive exceeds"}
{"text":"We present an analytical approach to study the dynamics of the contact process on complex networks with arbitrary degree distributions, including scale-free (SF) ones. The method is based on super-critical series expansions around the epidemic threshold. We show that this technique allows one to obtain accurate results even when the network size N becomes very large. In particular we find that the SF exponent has only a weak effect on the critical behavior at the transition point. This result suggests that the universality class of the phase transition does not depend on the details of the underlying topology but rather it depends solely on its average connectivity. Finally, our analysis shows that the presence of quenched randomness can lead to significant deviations from mean-field predictions. \nI. INTRODUCTORY REMARK\nThe contact process [1] , which describes the spreading of infectious diseases or computer viruses [2] , plays a central role in many areas of physics ranging from statistical mechanics [3] to epidemiology [4] . It also represents a paradigmatic model for studying self-organized criticality [5] .\nIn recent years there have been several attempts [6] - [8] aimed at extending the original formulation of the contact process by adding some ingredients such as spatial structure [9] , aging [10] , memory [11] , and heterogeneities [12] . These extensions are motivated by the fact that real-world systems often exhibit non-trivial topological features [13] and\/or they evolve over time [14] . However, despite these efforts, the exact solution of the contact process remains elusive [15] .\nRecently, new techniques [16] - [18] were developed to tackle analytically problems related to the contact process on complex topologies. Among them, the so-called super-critical series expansion [19] provides a powerful tool to investigate the properties of the system close to the epidemic threshold [20] . Indeed, using this approach, it was possible to derive closed-form expressions for the probability distribution function [21] and the first two moments [22] of the number of infected nodes in the steady state. Moreover, it allowed us to determine the scaling laws characterizing the relaxation towards equilibrium [23] ."}
{"text":"We have investigated whether collisional excitation by neutral hydrogen is an important process in determining the solar spectrum of titanium (Ti) and calcium (Ca). We used the CHIANTI atomic database to calculate the contribution functions, which show how much each ion contributes to the total line intensity at different heights above the photosphere. The results indicate that there are no significant contributions from collisional excitation between ions or electrons and neutral hydrogen atoms below 1 Mm height. Above this height we find that the contribution function increases rapidly up to 2 Mm where it reaches its maximum value before decreasing again towards higher altitudes. This behaviour can be explained by the fact that the density decreases exponentially as one moves away from the surface while the temperature remains constant. Our calculations suggest that collisional excitation by neutral H may play only a minor role in producing the observed solar spectrum of these elements. However, further investigations using more realistic models of the solar atmosphere will be required to confirm our findings."}
{"text":"We present here an overview of our numerical method for propagating cosmic ray particles through the Galactic magnetic field and interstellar medium, including all relevant physical processes such as diffusion, convection, adiabatic deceleration\/acceleration, nuclear fragmentation and radioactive decay. We discuss how we treat the various sources of uncertainty associated with these processes (e.g., uncertainties in the strength and structure of the Galactic magnetic field) by performing several different calculations using different assumptions about each process. Finally, we describe some preliminary results obtained from this code which demonstrate that it is capable of reproducing many observed features of the diffuse gamma-ray emission produced by cosmic ray interactions with gas throughout the Milky Way. The main goal of this work is to develop a new technique for studying the origin and propagation of cosmic rays on cosmological scales. \n \n High-energy cosmic rays are believed to be accelerated at astrophysical shocks driven by supernova remnants or active galactic nuclei. These energetic particles then propagate diffusively through space until they interact with matter or radiation fields along their trajectories. In doing so, they produce secondary photons and neutrinos via hadronuclear reactions and inverse Compton scattering respectively. Cosmic rays also contribute significantly to the total pressure support within galaxies and may play an important role in regulating star formation rates therein. However, despite decades of theoretical study, there remain significant uncertainties regarding both the acceleration mechanisms responsible for producing cosmic rays and the transport properties of those same cosmic rays once they have been accelerated. This situation has led to considerable debate over whether cosmic rays can account for the bulk of the pressure required to maintain the regular rotation curves of spiral galaxies without violating observational constraints imposed by the non-detection of dark matter halos around most nearby galaxies.  \n \n To address these questions, we have developed a new computational tool called GALPROP (Galaxy Propagator), which solves numerically the time-dependent transport equation describing the evolution of cosmic ray distributions in three spatial dimensions under the influence of large-scale magnetic fields and turbulent motions. Our approach involves discretizing the distribution function into a large number of"}

The source was observed during more than 10 years between 1996 February and 2007 December. We found that the pulse period shows significant changes on time scales ranging from days to months. In addition, we detected several large-amplitude outbursts lasting up to 100 days each. These outbursts are characterized by an increase in both intensity and hardness ratio. During these outbursts, the spin-up rate increased significantly compared to those before or after them. This indicates that the magnetic field strength at the surface of the star increases when it undergoes such outbursts. \n \n Keywords: Accretion disk - Neutron star - Outburst"}
{"text":"We study the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) and its stability properties for a class of ultimatum games with two-sided incomplete information, where one player is informed about his opponent's type while the other has no such information. We show that there exists a unique ESS which coincides with the Nash equilibrium if the set of types is finite or compactly supported on [0, 1] . If this set contains unbounded elements then we prove that the ESS may be unstable under small perturbations of the payoff functions. In particular, it can be shown that any ESS must satisfy certain conditions related to the distribution function of the types. Finally, we present some numerical examples illustrating our results. The evolutionary game theory studies how strategies evolve over time when players interact repeatedly within large populations. It provides a natural framework for analyzing strategic interactions between self-interested agents who are unable to commit themselves ex-ante but have the opportunity to learn by observing past play. A typical example of such situation arises in bargaining problems where each agent makes offers sequentially without knowing what proposals will be made by their opponents. This problem was first studied by Guth et al. (1982) , who introduced the so-called ultimatum game as a model of bargaining between two selfish individuals. In this game, Player 1 proposes a division of a fixed amount of money M into shares x and y = M \u2212x offered to himself and Player 2 respectively; Player 2 either accepts or rejects the offer. If he accepts, both players receive their respective shares according to the proposal; otherwise they get nothing. Since the seminal work of Guth et al., many authors have investigated various aspects of the ultimatum game including existence and multiplicity of equilibria, efficiency loss due to lack of commitment power etc. (see e.g. Binmore & Shaked, 1993; Ochs & Roth, 1989) . However, all these works assume complete information among the players."}
{"text":"We study the cosmological evolution in bigravity theory, which is an extension to general relativity that includes two metrics with different gravitational strengths. We find that this model can be described by a single scalar field whose potential has three extrema corresponding to stable de Sitter solutions. The first extremum corresponds to the standard vacuum solution while the other two are new branches of solutions. In these new branches there exists a time-dependent background for one metric but not for the other. This leads to spontaneous breaking of diffeomorphism invariance at late times. We also consider massive gravity theories where the graviton mass term violates local Lorentz symmetry. These models have been shown to exhibit interesting phenomenology such as superluminal propagation of gravitons. Here we show how they can be derived from a Lagrangian containing only second derivatives of the fields. Finally, we discuss some open problems related to both types of theories."}
{"text":"We present an analysis of synthetic stellar libraries used to calibrate photometric surveys, such as Gaia and LSST. We show that these libraries are not accurate enough for this purpose because they do not include all relevant physical processes in their models (e.g., convection). This leads to systematic errors when using them to calibrate photometry or derive distances. We demonstrate how we can use observations of open clusters with known ages and metallicities to test the accuracy of different synthetic libraries by comparing observed and predicted cluster properties. Finally, we discuss possible improvements on current synthetic libraries. The next generation of space-based telescopes will provide unprecedented amounts of data about our Galaxy. These new datasets require large efforts to be analyzed properly. One important aspect is the calibration of photometric surveys like Gaia and LSST which will deliver precise astrometry and multi-color photometry for billions of stars across the sky. To achieve high precision results it is crucial to understand potential sources of error and biases introduced during the reduction process. In particular, one has to ensure that the derived absolute magnitudes M_(V) are correct within 0.01 mag over most of the color range covered by the survey. \n \n For example, if the distance modulus DM = 5log10(d\/d_sun), where d is the true distance between us and the star and d_sun is the Sun\u2019s distance from Earth, then a difference of 0.01 mag corresponds to a factor of 1.1 in distance. Thus, even small uncertainties in the absolute magnitude scale translate into significant errors in inferred distances. Therefore, it is essential to have reliable methods to determine the absolute magnitudes of individual stars accurately before deriving distances.  \n \n Currently there exist several approaches to estimate absolute magnitudes based on theoretical model atmospheres. However, these models often fail to reproduce observational constraints at low temperatures and\/or high surface gravities. As a result, the resulting absolute magnitudes may deviate significantly from those obtained through other techniques, e.g., eclipsing binaries. Moreover, some of these models also suffer from incomplete"}

These short-period planets are particularly interesting because they may be tidally locked into synchronous rotation about their axes, which would lead to strong day-night contrasts on their surfaces. Furthermore, these planets' atmospheres will experience extreme conditions due to high temperatures and intense radiation fields. As such, understanding how planetary atmospheres respond under these circumstances can provide important insights into processes occurring within our own Solar System as well as other planetary systems. \n \n Here we present the discovery and initial characterization of TrES-3b; a hot Jupiter with a period P = 3.09 d discovered by the transit method. Using follow-up observations made with the Spitzer Space Telescope, we show that TrES-3b orbits close enough to its parent star so that tidal forces should synchronize the planet's spin axis with its orbital angular momentum vector. However, we do not detect any significant infrared excess emission associated with the planet itself or its host star, indicating that either the planet does not possess a large amount of dusty material surrounding it and\/or that the planet is too cool to produce detectable thermal emission beyond 4 microns."}

INTRODUCTIO N The decay B_s --> \\gamma \\gamma has been studied extensively both experimentally [1] and theoretically [2] , since it provides one of the most promising ways to search for physics beyond the standard model [3] .\nIn the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model (MSSM), there exist several contributions to this process [4] - [6] : \nwhere FV stands for fermion-antifermion annihilation diagrams, VVV denotes vertex corrections involving three vector bosons, and VVGG represents box diagrams containing four gauge bosons. These contributions have been calculated previously using various techniques [7, 8] . However, all previous calculations were performed within the framework of dimensional regularization [9] , where ultraviolet divergences appear only in even dimensions [10] . This leads to potentially large logarithms ln(4-mt) appearing in the expressions for the amplitudes [11] . It was shown recently [12] that such terms may be resummed to all orders in perturbation theory if one uses the so-called 't Hooft-Veltman scheme [13] instead of dimensional regularization. As a result, the corresponding amplitudes become finite and do not contain any additional singularities apart from those associated with infrared or collinear regions [14] ."}
{"text":"We present new Chandra observations of Abell 1689, which reveal that the X-ray gas is highly enriched with metals out to large radii ($R_{vir} \\sim 1.5 Mpc$). The metallicity profile shows an increase by more than one order of magnitude between $R = 100 kpc$ and $R = 300 kpc$. We argue that this enrichment can be explained if galactic superwinds are responsible for transporting heavy elements into the intracluster medium in massive clusters such as Abell 1689. This scenario would also explain why we do not see any significant decrease in the metal abundance towards larger clustercentric distances. Our results suggest that galactic winds may have played an important role in shaping galaxy evolution on scales beyond individual galaxies. In addition, our findings provide strong evidence against models where the ICM is pre-enriched before it collapses into dark matter halos."}
{"text":"We have investigated the frequency distribution of semi-major axis (SMA) for wide binaries with separations greater than 1000 AU in order to test cosmogonies and dynamical evolution models. We used data obtained by the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS), which is complete down to Ks = 12 mag, corresponding to masses as low as 0.1 M\u2299 at distances up to 1 kpc. The sample consists of 13,000 pairs selected using color-color criteria designed to select main-sequence stars. Using Monte Carlo simulations we found that our results are not affected significantly by incompleteness effects due to photometric errors or contamination by background galaxies. Our analysis shows that there exists an excess number of systems with SMA between 10 4 -10 5 AU compared to predictions based on standard cosmological models. This result suggests that either these systems were formed earlier than predicted by current theories or they may be primordial objects such as Population III remnants."}
{"text":"We report on the measurement of electric fields produced by surface contaminants using neutral atoms as probes. The technique is based on measuring the Stark shift in atomic resonance lines due to an applied electric field, and has been used previously for studying electric fields near surfaces such as those found at liquid helium temperatures or in high vacuum environments.  We have extended this method to measure electric fields over a wide range of temperatures (4 K - 300 K) and pressures (10-6 Torr - atmospheric pressure). In addition we demonstrate that it can be used to study electric fields generated by charged particles trapped close to surfaces. This work opens up new possibilities for probing electric fields in many different systems including biological samples where conventional techniques are limited. Measurement of electric fields produced by charged particle traps using neutral atoms: A novel probe of local electrostatic potentials. Measuring electric fields produced by surface contaminant... Neutral atoms provide a unique tool for investigating electric fields because they respond directly to the vector potential associated with electromagnetic fields. Here we use this property to measure electric fields produced by surface contamination. Our approach relies on observing the Stark splitting of atomic energy levels when exposed to external electric fields. Previous experiments have demonstrated this effect in low temperature and ultra-high vacuum conditions1-5 but here we show how these measurements may also be performed under more typical laboratory conditions."}
{"text":"We present the first results on deep infrared (IR) observations with ISOCAM at 12 um, ISO at 15 um, ESO-VLT\/VISIR at 11.7 um, and Spitzer\/MIPS at 24 um in the Sculptor galaxy cluster field. The data are used to study the evolution of galaxies over the last 8 Gyrs as well as their contribution to the extragalactic background light (EBL). We find that the IR luminosity function evolves strongly between z=0.5-0.8 and today. At high redshifts we detect an excess number density of luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs), ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs), and active galactic nuclei (AGNs) compared to local samples. This is consistent with previous studies based on optical\/NIR surveys. However, our sample contains only few objects which can be classified as LIRGs or ULIRGs using standard criteria. Instead, most sources show very large dust extinction values A(V)>10 mag. These sources have been missed so far because they were not detected in optical\/NIR surveys due to heavy obscuration. In addition, we find evidence for a significant fraction of heavily extincted early-type galaxies among these sources."}
{"text":"We present the results of an investigation into the physical properties of weak Mg II absorbers (WAs) in quasar spectra, using high-resolution spectroscopy and photoionization modeling. We find that WAs are typically associated with galaxies having stellar masses M* ~ 10^10 to 10^11 solar masses, star formation rates SFR = 0.1-10 Msun\/yr, and metallicities Z = 0.2 - 1 times solar metallicity. The majority of these systems have low ionization parameters log U < -2.5, indicating they are likely dominated by diffuse gas rather than dense clouds. These findings suggest that WAs may be related to galactic winds driven out of star-forming regions. In addition we find evidence for two distinct populations of WAs; one population is characterized by relatively strong absorption lines which appear to arise primarily within galaxy halos, while another population has weaker absorption features which seem to originate closer to the central region of their host galaxies."}
{"text":"We present the results of an analysis of the shapes, orientations, and alignments of dark matter subhalos in cosmological N-body simulations with different levels of baryonic physics included.  We find that the inclusion of baryons has little effect on the shape distribution but does affect the spin parameter distributions significantly; halos are more spherical when baryons are included than they would be if only gravity were acting upon them. The halo spins tend to be aligned perpendicularly to their major axes for all models considered here (including pure dark matter). This is consistent with previous studies which have found similar trends using other methods. However we also find evidence that this trend may not hold at very small scales where there appears to be some correlation between the direction of the angular momentum vector and the minor axis of the halo. Finally, we show that the presence or absence of baryons affects the degree of alignment between neighboring halos; halos are less strongly clustered around each other when baryons are included."}
{"text":"We present new distances for eight open clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) using near-infrared photometry and isochrone fitting techniques. The red clump giants are used as standard candles, with their absolute magnitudes determined by comparison with Galactic globular cluster data.

{"text":"We present BVRI surface photometry for isolated spiral galaxies in the nearby universe (0.01 < z < 0.1). The sample consists of 12 objects selected by their morphological type, inclination and apparent size to be suitable targets for detailed studies with integral field spectroscopy. We use archival data obtained at the Kitt Peak National Observatory 4m telescope as well as new observations taken during our own observing runs between 2005-2007. Our analysis is based on two-dimensional fitting of exponential disk models using GALFIT. In addition we perform bulge-disk decomposition using two different methods. First, we fit S\u00e9rsic profiles to both components simultaneously. Second, we apply an iterative method where we first subtract the best-fit model from each image before performing another round of fits. This procedure allows us to study the properties of individual galaxy components separately. For all but one object we find that the results are consistent within the uncertainties."}
{"text":"We present new characterizations for multivariable functions in the Schur class, which are defined as those analytic on the open unit disk that satisfy certain growth conditions at infinity.  We show how to construct such functions by using an operator-theoretic approach based on the concept of a positive kernel. In particular, we prove that every function in the Schur class can be realized as the transfer function of some stable system with state space dimension equal to its McMillan degree (the number of poles inside the closed unit disk). This result is obtained via a generalization of the classical theorem due to Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov. Finally, we also provide necessary and sufficient conditions under which two given functions belong to the same Schur class. These results have applications in control theory and signal processing.

{"text":"We study static and dynamic properties of the 1D extended Hubbard model (EHM) with nearest-neighbor hopping t, next-nearest neighbor hopping t2, on-site Coulomb repulsion U , and chemical potential \u03bc . We use exact diagonalization to calculate the single-particle density matrix $\\rho$ for different fillings n = N \/ L at half-filling (\u03bc = 0). The off-diagonal elements of $\\rho$ are related to the charge susceptibility $ \\chi_{c}$ via the fluctuation dissipation theorem. In addition we compute the spin susceptibility $ \\chi_{s}$ using the Lanczos method. \n \n For small values of t2\/t < 0.1 our results show that both susceptibilities increase as a function of filling n. This is consistent with previous studies which have shown that the ground state of this system has antiferromagnetic correlations. However, when t2\/t > 0.1 there exists an intermediate regime where the charge susceptibility decreases while the spin susceptibility increases. These results suggest that the ground state of the system becomes ferromagnetic in nature."}
{"text":"We present the second part of our study on non-metric gravity theory in which we find that there is no missing mass problem for quasars as claimed by some authors.  We also show that this theory can explain the redshifts of quasars without introducing any new parameter or concept into physics. In addition to these results, we discuss how this theory may be tested experimentally using gravitational waves produced by binary pulsar systems. The first part of this work has been published recently [1] . \nI. INTRODUCTORY REMARK\nIn recent years many authors have studied various aspects of nonmetric gravity theories [2] - [8] , but none of them seems to have considered the possibility of testing such theories with observations made on distant objects like quasars (QSOs). This is surprising because it was shown previously [9] that one particular version of non-metric gravity could solve the missing mass problem associated with QSOs. It should therefore not come as a surprise if other versions of non-metric gravity are able to do so too."}
{"text":"We report the detection of periodic bursts of coherent radio emission at 1.4 GHz and 8.5 GHz, with periods ranging between 0.3 s to 3.6 s, from the ultracool dwarf TVLM 513-46546 (M8V).

Their properties suggest that they may originate from gyrosynchrotron radiation produced within magnetic loops anchored to the surface of this star. \n \n This discovery opens up new avenues for studying the magnetospheres of low-mass stars through direct imaging techniques."}
{"text":"The zeta-function is the main object in number theory and algebraic geometry.  In this talk I will explain how it can be used to study quantum field theories on curved spacetimes with non-trivial topology.   The basic idea is that one considers the Feynman path integral over all fields on spacetime as an infinite dimensional functional integration which can then be regularized by replacing the space of fields by a finite dimensional vector space equipped with a suitable norm.    This leads naturally to the concept of a \"quantum torus\" whose zeta function encodes information about the spectrum of the corresponding QFT.   We will also discuss some recent results concerning the relation between the zeta functions of certain families of quantum tori and their associated modular forms. Quantum Field Theory (QFT) has been developed into a powerful tool for studying physical phenomena at the most fundamental level. However, many interesting questions remain open due to the difficulty of performing calculations beyond perturbation theory. One way out of these difficulties is to use ideas from mathematics such as those coming from number theory or algebraic geometry. In particular, we are interested in using the so-called \"zeta-functions\" of algebraic varieties to obtain new insights into QFTs. These objects encode important information about the underlying physics but they are notoriously difficult to compute explicitly. In my talk I'll give examples where explicit computations have been performed successfully and show how these techniques could lead to further progress in our understanding of QFTs."}
{"text":"We study the dynamics of an interacting tachyonic field in a spatially flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe with zero spatial curvature, using numerical methods to solve the equations of motion.  We find that there are two distinct phases during which the energy density evolves differently; one phase is dominated by the kinetic energy of the fields while the other is dominated by their potential energies.  The transition between these phases occurs when the Hubble parameter becomes comparable to the mass scale associated with the interaction term.  During this transition period we observe oscillatory behavior in both the Hubble parameter and the energy densities of each individual field.  In addition, we find that the total energy density decreases more slowly than it would if only one component were present (i.e., either a single tachyonic or a single scalar field).  Finally, we show how our results can be used to construct viable inflationary models. We consider a model consisting of a tachyonic field coupled to another scalar field through a quartic self-interaction term.  Using numerical techniques, we examine the time-evolution of various quantities such as the Hubble parameter, the energy densities of each field individually, and the total energy density.  Our analysis reveals several interesting features including the presence of a transition region where the Hubble parameter becomes comparable..."}
{"text":"We study the message throughput performance of dynamic peer-to-peer systems with unreliable links and limited bandwidth, where peers are connected to each other via overlay networks. We propose two models for such systems: (1) an analytical model based on mean field theory; and (2) a simulation-based model that is built upon ns-2 network simulator. The results show that our proposed models can accurately predict the message throughput under different settings. In addition, we find that the message throughput decreases as the number of nodes increases or the average node degree decreases. Finally, we compare the message throughputs achieved by three popular overlay routing protocols: flooding, random walk, and epidemic routing. Our findings suggest that flooding achieves higher message throughput than both random walk and epidemic routing when there exists only one source-destination pair. However, if multiple pairs exist simultaneously, then epidemic routing outperforms flooding because it allows messages to be forwarded along multiple paths at once."}

The spectrum reveals strong Balmer absorption lines indicating young stellar populations. Its oxygen abundance is found to be one third solar or lower, which makes SDSS J121811+ 465501 the lowest-metallicity galaxy known at z=0.1.

{"text":"We study Hawking radiation from Schwarzschild-de-Sitter and Kerr-de-Sitter black holes by using the tunneling method. We find that, for both cases, there is no outgoing flux at infinity but only an incoming one. This result can be understood as follows: The vacuum state outside the horizon has to be defined with respect to the Killing vector field which becomes null on the event horizon. However, this definition does not agree with the usual choice made inside the horizon where it agrees with the time translation symmetry. As a consequence, we have two different vacua and therefore particles are created between these regions. In addition, we show that the temperature of the emitted particles depends on the cosmological constant. For small values of \u039b, the temperature approaches its value obtained without taking into account gravity effects. On the other hand, when \u039b increases, the temperature decreases until it vanishes completely for large enough values of \u039b."}
{"text":"The driving mechanism for jets and outflows is still an open question, especially when the jet\/outflow source has no clear central engine such as black holes or protostars. In this work we propose that magnetic reconnection can be responsible for launching jets and outflows in star formation process.

The accelerated electrons will produce synchrotron emission which may explain radio observations of jets and outflows. Furthermore, the energetic protons produced during RCS also contribute to nonthermal emissions through inverse Compton scattering with background photons. Finally, we discuss how our model could account for some observational features of jets and outflows. \n \n Keywords: Magnetic reconnection; Jet; Particle acceleration; Shocks; Synchrotron radiation; Nonthermal emission"}
{"text":"We study the gluing problem for pseudoholomorphic curves in symplectic 4-manifolds with cylindrical ends, which are obtained by attaching 2-handles to a closed symplectic surface. We prove that if two such surfaces can be connected by an embedded cylinder whose core is homologically nontrivial and has vanishing Maslov index then they can be smoothly pasted together into one pseudoholomorphic curve. This result generalizes our previous work on this subject ([GZ]). As applications we give new proofs of some results about Lagrangian tori in symplectic 4-spaces due to McDuff-Salamon [MS1] . \nIntroduction.\nIn [GZ] , we studied the gluing problem for pseudo-holomorphic curves in sympletic 4-manifolds with cylindrically ends: Let $(M_1, \\omega_1)$ and $(M_\\ast, \\omega_\\ast)$ be symplectic 4-manfolds with cylindrical ends $\\Sigma_1$ and $\\Sigma_2$ respectively; i.e., there exist compact symplectic surfaces $S_i$ and embeddings $f_i : \\Sigma_i \\to M_i$ such that $M_i \\setminus f_i(\\Sigma_i)$ is diffeomorphic to $R \\times S^2$. If there exists an embedding $g : \\Sigma_1 \\to M_*\\backslash f_2(\\Sigma_2)$ satisfying certain conditions, then we proved that any pseudoholomorphic curve in $(M_1,\\omega_1)$ can be smoothly pasted onto any other pseudoholomorphic curve lying in $(M_*, \\omega_\\ast)\\setminus g(\\Sigma_1)$. \nThe main purpose of this note is to extend this theorem to more general situations where the cores of the connecting cylinders have vanishing Maslov indices but may not necessarily be homologically trivial.

A thin layer of SiO2 is deposited as insulation between the source\/drain contacts and FG. Electrical measurements show that this structure exhibits good electrical characteristics such as high drain-source current density (JDS), low threshold voltage (Vth), and small subthreshold swing (SS). In addition, we have observed a large negative shift in Vth after plasma treatment for 30 s at room temperature. This indicates that the charge trapping effect can be effectively controlled through plasma treatment. \n \n Keywords: GaN-based transistors; Plasma effects; Floating gate devices; High electron mobility transistors"}

{"text":"We study the SIR epidemic spreading on an ensemble of random networks, where each node has its own degree distribution and is connected to other nodes according to this distribution. We show that for any given initial condition there exists a critical value of the infection rate above which the disease spreads through all networks; below it only a finite fraction of nodes are infected at large times. The transition between these two regimes occurs via a continuous phase transition. In addition we find that the final size of the outbreak depends strongly on the heterogeneity of the underlying degree distributions. Finally, we present numerical results showing how our analytical predictions compare well against simulations. \nI. INTRODUCTORY REMARK\nThe spread of infectious diseases such as SARS or influenza can be modeled by means of simple mathematical models known as compartmental models [1] . These models divide the population into different classes depending on their state (e.g., susceptible, infective, recovered). They assume that individuals move from one class to another following certain rules; e.g., susceptibles become infectives upon contact with infectives, while infectives recover after some time. Compartmental models have been used extensively over the past decades to understand the mechanisms behind the propagation of epidemics [2] .\nIn recent years, researchers have started to use more realistic models based on complex networks [3] , i.e., graphs whose vertices represent individuals and edges represent contacts among them [4] . This approach allows us to take into account important features observed in real-world systems like scale-free behavior [5] , community structure [6] , etc.. However, despite the fact that many studies have focused on understanding the effect of topological properties on the evolution of epidemics [7, 8] , little attention has been paid so far to the role played by the heterogeneity of the degrees of the nodes [9] . Here we address this issue using a model similar to those proposed recently [10, 11] but allowing for arbitrary degree distributions instead of restricting ourselves to Poissonian ones [12] ."}
{"text":"We present the results of an extensive study on the long-term optical spectral variability of the blazar BL Lacertae (BL Lac). The data were obtained with the 1-m telescope at Mt. Wilson Observatory, California and the 2.5 m Nordic Optical Telescope in La Palma, Canaries Islands during the period 1990-2000. We found that the continuum flux density varied by more than one order of magnitude over this time span. In addition to the strong variations we also detected significant changes in the shape of the spectrum. These are interpreted as being due to intrinsic changes in the source's emission mechanism and\/or relativistic beaming effects caused by rapid jet motions. Our observations show that the synchrotron peak frequency shifted towards higher frequencies when the source brightened. This is consistent with theoretical predictions for blazars. However, our analysis indicates that there may exist additional components contributing to the observed spectral energy distribution besides the standard SSC model."}
{"text":"We present numerical results for the evolution of two different types of solar coronal mass ejection (CME) in an open magnetic field configuration, which is relevant to space weather applications. The first type of CMEs are driven by photospheric motions that generate Alfv\u00e9n waves at the base of the corona; these waves propagate upward into the corona where they steepen into shocks. The second type of CMEs are triggered by flux rope instabilities associated with current sheets formed during reconnection events between closed loops and open fields lines. We find that both types of CMEs can accelerate plasma up to speeds exceeding 1000 km\/s. However, only the first type of CMEs have significant density enhancements compared to their surroundings. In addition, we show that the first type of CME has a higher probability of producing geomagnetic storms than the second one because it contains more energetic particles. Finally, our results suggest that the first type of simulated CMEs may be responsible for some observed halo CMEs."}
{"text":"We study the closed bosonic string field theory (CBFST) on the quintic Calabi-Yau threefold in the large volume limit, where we can use the perturbative expansion to compute the effective potential for marginal deformations. We show that the CBFST reproduces correctly the results obtained by Witten's cubic open-string field theory (OSFT). In particular, we find that the leading order term agrees with the OSFT result up to an overall factor which is determined by the normalization condition of the vertex operators. The subleading terms are also reproduced correctly except for one missing term proportional to $(-1)^{10}$. This discrepancy may be explained as follows. First, it turns out that there exists another solution to the equation of motion besides the usual tachyon vacuum solution. Second, this new solution has a different energy density than the usual tachyon vacuum solution: It is lower if the coupling constant $\\gamma$ satisfies $\\gamma > 1$ but higher otherwise. Finally, we argue that the contribution from this new solution should not be included when computing the effective potential because its effect cancels against the contribution from the usual tachyon vacuum."}
{"text":"We study the SIR epidemic model on an evolving contact network with time-varying transmission rates and recovery probabilities, where individuals are allowed to change their connections over time. We show that if the infection rate is sufficiently large compared to the recovery probability then there exists a unique endemic equilibrium point which attracts all solutions starting within its basin of attraction. In addition we prove that for any initial condition outside this basin of attraction the disease will eventually die out. Finally, we provide numerical simulations illustrating our results. The SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) epidemic model has been widely used as a mathematical tool to describe the spread of infectious diseases such as influenza or SARS [1] . This simple deterministic compartmental model divides the population into three classes according to individuals' states: susceptible, infected and recovered\/removed. Individuals can move between these different states depending on certain parameters describing the evolution of the epidemic process [2] .\nIn recent years researchers have started studying the dynamics of epidemic processes taking place on complex networks [3, 4] , i.e., graphs whose nodes represent individuals and edges represent contacts among them. These studies have shown how important it is to take into account the underlying topology when modeling the spreading of infections [5, 6] . For example, it was found that the presence of highly connected hubs may lead to the emergence of super-spreaders [7, 8] who play a crucial role in determining whether the outbreak becomes global [9] . Moreover, it turns out that even small changes in the structure of the network might significantly affect the final outcome [10, 11] ."}
{"text":"We study the electrical excitation of nonlinear waves in a 2D channel with an applied voltage bias between two parallel metal plates separated by a dielectric layer.

{"text":"We study algebraic properties of real geodesic curves on ellipsoids, which are defined by quadratic forms with positive definite matrices.

This result can be considered as a generalization of the classical theorem about density of rational numbers among reals. The proof uses results of A.N.

In addition, we give examples of families of geodesics whose parameters belong to different connected components of the parameter space but they are not algebraically conjugate (Example 3)."}
{"text":"We study the scattering amplitudes for gluons and gravitons at strong coupling using classical string solutions in Anti-de Sitter space (AdS). We show that these amplitudes can be obtained by evaluating certain correlation functions on the worldsheet boundary, which are related to tree-level gauge theory amplitudes via holography. The results agree with those found previously using integrability techniques. In addition we find new contributions to the graviton-graviton amplitude involving an infinite tower of massive states. These arise because our solution is not invariant under global Poincare transformations; they correspond to corrections to the supergravity action induced by higher derivative terms in the bulk effective field theory. \nIntroduction\n\nThe AdS\/CFT correspondence [1] relates type IIB superstrings propagating in ten-dimensional anti-de Sitter space-time (AdS) to conformal field theories living on its four-dimensional boundary. This duality has been used extensively over recent years as a tool to explore non-perturbative phenomena in quantum gravity [2] . It also provides a novel approach to studying strongly-coupled gauge theories such as QCD [3] .\nIn this talk we will consider the simplest example of the AdS\/CFT correspondence -the maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills (N=4 SYM) theory [4] , whose dual description involves type IIA strings moving in AdS 5 \u00d7 S 5 [5] . At weak 't Hooft coupling \u03bb = g 2 Y M N \u226a 1, where g Y M denotes the Yang-Mills coupling constant, perturbative calculations have shown that the two descriptions match exactly [6] . However, it remains unclear how to calculate quantities like scattering amplitudes directly within the gauge theory at large values of \u03bb [7, 8] . On the other hand, one may use the AdS\/CFT dictionary [9] to translate between observables calculated in either side of the duality. For instance, the expectation value of Wilson loops in the gauge theory corresponds to the area of minimal surfaces embedded into AdS [10] ; while n-point correlators of local operators in the gauge theory are given by functional integrals over n-punctured Riemann surfaces [11] ."}
{"text":"We study the first-order phase transition between two phases with different densities for several classical lattice gas spin models, including the hard-core model and the Ising model on square lattices. We show that the density difference across the interface is proportional to the surface tension at coexistence.

For all these models, there exists a first-order phase transition between low-density and high-density phases [7\u20139] . This means that both phases coexist under certain conditions [10] . As an example, Figs. 1(a), 2(a) ,and 3(a) show typical configurations of the system near the critical point for the hard-core model [11] ,the Ising model [12] ,and the Blume-Capel [13] model respectively.

{"text":"We present an explicit formula for the TYZ expansion of the Kepler manifold, which is a complete intersection in $\\mathbb{C}^3$ with defining equations $xy - zw = 0$ and $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1$.  The TYZ expansion is a formal power series that encodes information about the topology of the underlying space.  We show how to compute this expansion using Gr\u00f6bner bases techniques implemented by Singular.  This example illustrates some of the difficulties involved when computing such expansions explicitly. In particular we have to deal with singularities arising from the fact that the ideal generated by the polynomials defining our variety has infinitely many minimal primes. Finally, we use the TYZ expansion to prove that the fundamental group of the Kepler manifold is infinite cyclic. Let $K$ be the complex algebraic variety defined as follows:  $$K = \\{(x,y,z) \\in \\mathbb{C}^3: xy-zw=0\\ \\wedge\\ x^2+y^2+z^2=1\\}.$$  It follows immediately from the definition that $K$ is smooth (i.e., it does not contain any singular points).  Moreover, since $K$ is compact, its Euler characteristic equals one; hence, its Betti numbers are given by:  $$\\beta_0 = 1, \\beta_1 = 0, \\beta_2 = 1.$$  As a consequence, the first few terms of the Taylor\u2013Yau\u2013Zhang (TYZ) expansion of $K$ are:"}
{"text":"The quantum electrodynamic (QED) effects on the dynamics and decoherence of semiconductor-based qubit systems are investigated in this work. The QED effect is described by an effective interaction between the qubit system and its environment, which consists of vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field as well as thermal photons at finite temperature. We show that the QED effect can be treated perturbatively for typical experimental parameters. In particular, we find that the spontaneous emission rate of excitons into free space modes increases with increasing number N of electrons involved in the qubit state. This leads to faster relaxation times T 1 , but also to stronger pure dephasing rates T 2 . For realistic values of N = 10 \u2212 100, however, these effects remain small compared to other sources of relaxation such as phonon scattering or electron-electron interactions. \n \n Introduction \n \n Quantum information processing has attracted considerable attention over recent years due to its potential applications in various fields ranging from communication technology [1] to metrology [2] . Semiconductor-based solid-state devices have been proposed as promising candidates for realizing scalable quantum computers [3] . Among them, excitonic states in semiconductors [4] represent one of the most important classes of physical objects suitable for storing and manipulating quantum information [5] . However, it turns out that exciton-exciton interactions [6] lead to rapid decay processes [7, 8] , so that only few excitations may be stored coherently within each individual device [9] . To overcome this problem, several proposals have been made recently [10] - [13] based on hybrid structures consisting of different materials [14] - [16] .\n \nIn this Letter, we investigate how the quantum electrodynamic (or radiative) coupling [17] affects the dynamics of semiconductor-based qubit sys-tems. As shown schematically in Fig. 1(a) , our model includes two types of environments surrounding the qubit system: First, there exist vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic fields inside the cavity [18] , leading to spontaneous emission of excitons into free-space modes [19, 20] . Second, there exists a bath of thermal photons [21]"}
{"text":"We study the effects of large mass ratios on the evolution of binaries with two supermassive black holes (SMBHs). We find that, in general, SMBH binaries are efficiently driven to merge by their mutual gravitational radiation reaction force when they have comparable masses or one BH is much more massive than its companion. However, we also show that if there exists an additional perturber which has a mass ratio between 10 \u22123 and 1 relative to either of the SMBHs, then it can significantly affect the orbital decay rate of the SMBH binary system. In particular, for systems where both SMBHs have similar masses, such as those expected at galactic centers, the presence of a third body may lead to significant delay in the time required for the binary to merge due to gravitational wave emission. This effect could be important for understanding the formation history of some observed double-peaked AGNs. \n \n Keywords: Black hole - Binary black hole - Gravitational waves"}
{"text":"The ordering phenomenon is studied for the Hubbard model with nearest-neighbor hopping and on-site Coulomb repulsion at half-filling by means of the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method. The ground state phase diagram as functions of U\/t and t\/J are obtained, where J denotes the antiferromagnetic exchange coupling constant between neighboring sites. It is found that there exist three phases; paramagnetic metal, spin-density wave insulator, and charge-density wave insulator. In particular, we find that the transition point between the spin-density wave insulators and charge-density wave insulating states depends strongly on the ratio of t\/J. We also study the effect of electron-phonon interaction to this system using the DMRG combined with the self-consistent phonon theory. The results show that the electron-phonon interaction enhances the stability of the charge-density wave insulatory state against the magnetic field. \n \n Keywords: Ordering phenomenon, Hubbard model, density matrix renormalization"}

{"text":"We present novel examples of tree-level stable non-BPS D-branes in string theory, which are not associated with spacetime fermion zero modes and thus do not require the presence of orientifolds or other sources for tadpole cancellation. We show that these brane configurations can be constructed by wrapping unstable D-branes on supersymmetric cycles in Calabi-Yau threefolds. The resulting BPS states preserve half of the original supersymmetry but carry no net charge under any gauge group factor. These results provide new insights into the structure of moduli spaces of vacua in string theory. Introduction: In recent years there has been considerable interest in studying non-BPS D-brane (NBD) configurations in type II string theories [1] . NBDs have attracted attention because they may play an important role in understanding various phenomena such as tachyon condensation [2] , open-string pair production [3] , and black hole entropy [4] .\nIn this work we will focus our attention on NBDs whose stability is due to worldsheet instanton effects [5] - [8] rather than spacetime fermion zero-modes [9] . Such NBDs were first studied in [10] where it was shown that certain wrapped D3-branes could become stable at one-loop order without requiring the presence of orientifold planes [11] . Subsequently, several authors [12] - [16] have considered similar constructions involving different types of D-branes and compactifications. However, all of these works required some form of tadpole cancellation [17] so that the total RR-charge carried by the configuration vanishes. Tadpole cancellation conditions place strong constraints on the allowed values of fluxes and charges in the background geometry [18] . It would therefore be interesting if one could find examples of stable NBDs which did not require the presence of additional sources for tadpole cancellations."}
{"text":"We study the problem of finding solutions to random instances of Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs). We show that for many CSPs, including k-SAT and Max-Cut, there is an exponential number of solutions with high probability when the ratio between the number of constraints and the number of variables tends to infinity. This result implies that it may be impossible to find all solutions efficiently even if we allow ourselves to use randomization or approximation algorithms. In this work, we focus on the case where each solution has exactly one variable set to true. For such solutions, called pure solutions, we prove that they are exponentially rare as well. Finally, we present some experimental results which suggest that our theoretical predictions hold also for real-world instances of SAT and MAX-CUT. The main motivation behind studying these questions comes from the fact that several important combinatorial optimization problems can be formulated as CSPs."}

{"text":"We present the first steps towards building a library of synthetic galaxy SEDs (spectral energy distributions) that will be used to classify and parameterize unresolved galaxies in the Gaia data stream, as part of the Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC). The library is built using state-of-the-art stellar population synthesis models with different star formation histories, metallicities, dust content, and redshifts. We use this library to test two methods of classifying unresolved galaxies into broad morphological types based on their observed photometry only. In addition we show how these parameters can be constrained by fitting the full spectrum of an unresolved galaxy. This work was performed within the framework of the ESA Gaia mission. Keywords: Galaxy evolution; Stellar populations; Spectroscopy. 1 Introduction Galaxies are complex systems whose properties depend strongly on their mass, age, chemical composition, star formation history, and environment. These physical characteristics determine many observable quantities such as luminosity, colours, morphology, kinematics, etc., which have been studied extensively over several decades. However, it has become clear recently that there exist significant degeneracies between some of these observables and therefore they cannot be uniquely determined without additional information about the underlying physics or geometry of the system. For example, the total luminosity of a galaxy depends not only on its current star formation rate but also on its past star formation activity through the integrated light of old stars. Similarly, the colour of a galaxy depends both on its metallicity and on the amount of dust extinction along our line-of-sight. Therefore, accurate measurements of all relevant physical parameters require detailed spectroscopic observations covering large wavelength ranges. Such studies are now possible thanks to new space missions like GALEX, SDSS, 2MASS, Spitzer Space Telescope, Herschel Space Observatory, Chandra X-ray Observatory, XMM-Newton, Hubble Space Telescope, and most importantly, the upcoming European Space Agency's Gaia satellite. Gaia is expected to provide astrometric positions, parallaxes, proper motions, radial velocities, and multi-colour photometry for more than one billion objects"}
{"text":"We present an efficient scheme for solving the self-consistent problem within the framework of Dynamical Mean-Field Theory (DMFT). The method is based on a linearized version of the Muffin-Tin orbital approach, which allows to treat large systems with thousands of atoms at low computational cost. We show that our results are in good agreement with those obtained by other methods such as exact diagonalization or Quantum Monte Carlo simulations. In particular we study the evolution of the electronic structure across the metal-insulator transition in the Hubbard model. Finally, we discuss how this new technique can be used to investigate more complex materials like doped semiconductors. Introduction: Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT) has been widely applied to describe strongly correlated electron systems [1-3]. It provides a powerful tool to understand many-body effects beyond standard band-structure calculations [4] . However, its application to real materials requires the solution of a complicated quantum impurity problem [5] , whose numerical treatment becomes very demanding when dealing with realistic models [6] .\nIn order to overcome these difficulties several techniques have been developed [7-10]. Among them, the most popular ones are the iterative perturbation theory [11] , the non-crossing approximation [12] , the variational cluster approach [13] , the cellular DMFT [14] , the continuous-time QMC [15] , and the exact diagonalization [16] . All these approaches require the calculation of the Green's function G(k,\u03c9), which depends on two variables k and \u03c9. This makes their direct evaluation extremely time consuming even if one uses fast Fourier transforms [17] . To avoid this difficulty, it was proposed to use the so-called LMTOs [18] instead of Bloch functions. These orbitals are constructed so that they reproduce exactly the density matrix inside each atomic sphere [19] . They allow us to reduce considerably the number of degrees of freedom involved in the calculation [20] . Moreover, since the LMTOs do not depend explicitly on the wave vector k, the corresponding Green's function only needs to be calculated once [21] ."}
{"text":"We present an ab initio tight-binding model for calculating the optical properties of semiconductor nanocrystals, which is based on the solution of the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) within the framework of density functional theory (DFT). The BSE describes excitonic effects and allows to calculate absorption spectra with high accuracy. We show that our approach reproduces experimental results very well. In particular we find good agreement between calculated and measured absorption cross sections at low energies where quantum confinement dominates over electron-hole exchange interactions. Our method can be applied to any type of semiconductor material including doped systems as well as core-shell structures. Semiconductor nanocrystals are promising candidates for applications such as light-emitting diodes or solar cells due to their unique optoelectronic properties. However, it remains challenging to predict these properties accurately since they depend sensitively on the electronic structure of the system. Here we propose a new theoretical approach to tackle this problem by combining DFT calculations with the Bethe-Salpether equation (BSE), which takes into account excitonic effects beyond mean-field approaches like Kohn-Sham DFT. This enables us to obtain accurate predictions for the optical properties of semiconductor nanostructures."}
{"text":"We present an analysis of the stability of planetary systems in which protoplanetary embryos evolve under oligarchy, i.e., they are able to eject each other's neighbors by gravitational scattering but not themselves. We find that this process leads to rapid growth of the largest embryo until it reaches its isolation mass (the minimum mass required for runaway accretion). The system then evolves into either a single planet or two planets with comparable masses depending on how close the initial conditions were to instability. This evolution is very different than what happens when all bodies grow simultaneously; in particular, we show that there can be multiple stable outcomes even if the initial conditions are identical. Our results suggest that the formation of terrestrial planets may have proceeded through several stages including oligarchy before reaching their final state as observed today. In addition, our work provides new insights about the origin of Mercury-like planets. Protoplanetary embryos form in circumstellar disks around young stars and undergo mutual gravitational interactions during their growth phase. These interactions lead to orbital migration and dynamical instabilities such as collisions between neighboring embryos. If these processes occur frequently enough, only one body will survive at the end of the growth stage leaving behind a planetary system consisting of just one planet. However, recent studies indicate that many planetary systems contain more than one planet suggesting that some mechanism must exist to prevent complete destruction of the system. Here we study the possibility that protoplanetary embryos follow a hierarchical evolutionary path where they first grow hierarchically via gravitational scattering followed by runaway accretion once the largest embryo has reached its isolation mass. Using numerical simulations, we demonstrate that this scenario naturally explains the existence of multi-planet systems while also reproducing the properties of known exoplanets."}
{"text":"The ultimate fate of the universe is one of the most important questions in physics and cosmology today, but it has been difficult to answer because quantum mechanics (QM) cannot be applied directly to macroscopic systems such as the whole universe.  In this talk I will present an approach that allows us to use QM to study the evolution of the universe on all scales by applying it only to small subsystems within the universe.   This method can also be used to calculate the probability distribution for the time at which the universe ends its existence. The results are consistent with current observations and provide new insights into how the universe may end up. For example, we find that there is a finite probability that the universe will expand forever without ever ending or collapsing. We also show that if the universe does collapse then it must do so before 10^(10^28) years have passed since the Big Bang.

The IVBM is based on an effective Lagrangian density that describes the coupling between nucleons and mesons, including the rho-meson field as well as the omega-meson fields with their respective neutral currents. In this work we have used the extended version of the IVBM which includes also the delta-resonance degrees of freedom. We have calculated the energy levels for some selected even-even nuclei along with those corresponding to the first excited state of neighboring odd-A nuclei using the same set of parameters. It has been found that the inclusion of the delta resonance leads to better agreement with experimental data than without it. This fact indicates that the role played by the delta resonance should not be neglected when studying nuclear structure phenomena such as pairing correlations or shape coexistence.

On some polluted days, SOAs accounted for more than 50% of total submicron particulate matter mass concentrations. In addition to these two major sources, aged sea salt particles contributed significantly to PM2.5 mass concentration levels.

The latter regime can be understood as a consequence of the competition between the Zeeman energy and the condensation energy. In addition, we discuss how these results depend on the relative orientation of the FM magnetization with respect to the applied external magnetic field Hext. \n \n Introduction \n \n Superconducting materials have been widely studied over many years because they exhibit macroscopic quantum phenomena such as zero resistance at low temperatures [1] .

{"text":"We report the observation of electron-hole puddles in graphene using scanning single-electron transistors (SETs). The SET is fabricated on top of an exfoliated monolayer graphene flake and operated at cryogenic temperatures down to 4 K. We observe that the conductance through the SET depends strongly on its position with respect to the underlying graphene sheet, which we attribute to local variations in charge carrier density induced by charged impurities trapped between the substrate and the graphene layer. This effect can be suppressed by applying a gate voltage Vg = -40 V across the graphene sample. Our results demonstrate that the use of SETs as probes for studying electronic properties of two-dimensional materials such as graphene has great potential. In recent years there have been significant advances in the fabrication of devices based on carbon nanotubes [1] , silicon nanowires [2] or semiconductor quantum dots [3] . These nanostructures are used as active elements in various types of sensors [4] , optoelectronic [5] and photovoltaic [6] applications. However, these structures suffer from several drawbacks including poor reproducibility due to their small size and low yield during growth processes [7, 8] .\nIn contrast, graphene [9] offers many advantages over other two dimensional materials [10] : it is mechanically flexible [11] , chemically stable [12] , biocompatible [13] and electrically conductive [14] .

{"text":"We study the moduli spaces of stable rank six vector bundles on smooth cubic surfaces, and their relation with the geometry of these surfaces. We show that there is an open subset in this moduli space which parametrizes families of indecomposable vector bundles whose general member has no global sections but admits a filtration by line bundles such that each successive quotient is globally generated. This gives rise to a natural map from the moduli space into the Picard variety of the surface. The image of this map turns out to be a divisor in the Picard variety, called the Brill-Noether locus. In particular we prove that for any given integer n > 0, if the Brill-Noether number $\\nu(n)$ equals one then the corresponding Brill-Noether divisor contains infinitely many rational curves.

This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number JP16K05481. 1 Introduction Superstring theories have been studied extensively since they were proposed about thirty years ago [1] . They provide us not only with a consistent quantum gravity but also with various phenomenological models such as D-branes [2] , M-theory [3] , etc.. However, it seems difficult to quantize them exactly because their actions contain infinite number of fields. Therefore, many attempts have been made so far to find suitable formulations for superstrings [4] .\nOne of the most successful approaches is the light-cone formulation [5] - [8] where one can treat all the degrees of freedom at once without any truncation or approximation [9] .

{"text":"We study the magnetic field structure and evolution of neutron stars with type-II superconductivity, taking into account the effects of superfluidity on the stellar interior. We find that toroidal fields can be generated by differential rotation between normal matter and superfluids inside the star. The resulting toroidal field is strong enough to affect the spin-down rate of pulsars significantly. In particular, we show that it may explain why some young pulsars have much slower spindown rates than expected for their ages. \n \n Introduction \n \n Pulsar magnetospheres are believed to contain large-scale poloidal and toroidal magnetic fields (e.g., Goldreich & Julian 1969; Ruderman 1974). These fields play an important role in determining the observed properties of pulsar emission such as pulse profiles and polarization characteristics (e.g., Melrose 1995), but also influence the long-term evolution of pulsar periods through electromagnetic torques exerted at the light cylinder (e.g., Spitkovsky 2006). \n \n It has been suggested that toroidal fields could be produced during the formation process of neutron stars via dynamo action driven by convection or differential rotation between different components within the core region (Thompson & Duncan 1993) . However, recent studies suggest that this mechanism cannot generate sufficiently large toroidal fields to match observations (Heger et al. 2005 ). An alternative possibility is that toroidal fields are created by winding up poloidal fields due to rapid rotation of the crust (Braithwaite 2009) or by differential rotation between normal fluid and superfluid components in the interior of the star (Srinivasan et al. 1991; Srinivasan 1991a ) . \n \n In this work, we investigate how toroidal fields evolve over time under various physical conditions using numerical simulations.

{"text":"We have determined the iron abundance for two bright, blue supergiants (BSGs) in the Galactic globular clusters Omega Cen and M13 using high-resolution spectroscopy obtained with UVES at VLT-UT2 telescope.

We find that our values agree very well with previous determinations within their uncertainties. In particular we confirm the low Fe content found for one star in Omega Cen previously reported by Yong et al. (2005) . This is consistent with theoretical predictions which suggest that this cluster should be dominated by first generation stars formed out of material enriched only by massive supernovae. Our analysis also shows that both studied stars belong to the group of so-called \"blue stragglers\" -objects located above the main sequence turn-off point on the colour-magnitude diagram but still burning helium in their cores."}
{"text":"We present an effective gravitational action for the Standard Model based on a gauge-invariant formulation of the path integral over fermions and bosons, which is valid to all orders in perturbation theory. The resulting action contains only one free parameter, the dimensionless coupling constant $\\kappa$, whose value can be fixed by requiring that Newton's law holds at large distances. We show how this approach leads naturally to a renormalizable quantum field theory with spontaneous symmetry breaking. In particular we discuss the Higgs mechanism as well as the generation of masses for quarks and leptons. Finally, we give some numerical estimates for the values of the fundamental constants of nature predicted within our framework. Introduction: Gauge theories are widely used in particle physics to describe interactions between elementary particles. However, it has been known since the work of Feynman [1] , Schwinger [2] and Tomonaga [3] that these theories cannot be quantized using conventional methods because they contain unphysical degrees of freedom (ghosts). This problem was solved by Faddeev and Popov [4] who introduced a new method called \"gauge fixing\" into the formalism. Although this procedure solves the ghost problem, it introduces another difficulty -the so-called Gribov ambiguity [5] . It turns out that there exists no unique way of fixing the gauge [6] so that different choices lead to inequivalent results [7, 8] .\nIn order to overcome this obstacle, Batalin and Vilkovisky [9] proposed a generalization of the usual perturbative expansion around the trivial vacuum state. They showed that if one considers instead the most general classical solution of the Euler-Lagrange equations corresponding to the original Lagrangian density then the number of physical degrees of freedom becomes equal to the number of fields appearing in the initial lagrangian [10] . Moreover, the resulting functional integration measure is now invariant under local gauge transformations [11] . These ideas were further developed by Fradkin [12] and Vasiliev [13] who derived the complete set of Feynman rules for such theories."}
{"text":"We study the effect of adding a constant five-form field strength to type IIB supergravity on AdS5xS5 and its dual N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in four dimensions. We find that this leads to an additional term in the action which is proportional to the volume form of S5, but does not affect any other fields or equations of motion. The resulting solution has a non-vanishing dilaton at infinity, corresponding to a deformation of the conformal symmetry group by a scale transformation. This can be interpreted as giving rise to a mass gap for all states except those transforming trivially under the unbroken SO(4) subgroup of SU (4). In particular we show how this mechanism allows one to generate masses for all gauge bosons without breaking supersymmetry. We also discuss some possible generalizations of our results. Introduction: It was shown recently [1] , using the gauged linear sigma model approach [2] , that it is possible to deform the maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills (MSYM) theory in 4-dimensions such that only the vector multiplets acquire masses while preserving N = 1 supersymmetry. The authors showed that there are two different ways of doing this: either by turning on a constant three-form H-flux [3] or by introducing a constant fived-form F -flux [4] . They found that both these solutions preserve half of the original supersymmetries. However, they did not consider the possibility of having both types of fluxes simultaneously turned on. Here we will fill this gap and present new solutions where both H-and F -fluxes are turned on.

{"text":"The low energy effective theories for superstrings are supergravity and supersymmetric gauge theories in four dimensions, which can be obtained by compactifying the extra six spatial dimensions on a Calabi-Yau manifold.  In this talk I will discuss some recent results about lattice models that provide an alternative approach to studying these theories. The basic idea is to use Monte Carlo simulations to study supersymmetric field theories defined on a finite number of points (the sites) of a regular d-dimensional hypercubic lattice with periodic boundary conditions. These models have been studied extensively over the past few years using numerical techniques such as exact diagonalization, quantum Monte Carlo methods, and density matrix renormalization group algorithms. Recently we developed new Monte Carlo simulation techniques based on the worm algorithm that allow us to simulate large systems at very high temperatures where conventional Monte Carlo methods fail because they suffer from critical slowing down. We used our new method to calculate the free energies of several different supersymmetric lattice models including the N = 4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory and the N = 1 supersymmetric U(1) gauge theory coupled to matter fields in various representations."}
{"text":"We present new constraints on the contribution of infrared-selected sources to the unresolved cosmic X-ray background (CXB) using deep Chandra observations in combination with mid-infrared data from the Spitzer Space Telescope's Infrared Array Camera (IRAC). We use stacks of IRAC images at 3.6 and 4.5 microns, which are dominated by emission from old stellar populations, to select samples of galaxies that have been detected individually in X-rays. The stacked fluxes provide an estimate for the average X-ray luminosity per unit mass of these systems as well as their mean redshift distribution. By comparing this predicted source count model against our observed counts we can place limits on the fraction of CXB photons produced by obscured AGN associated with these galaxy populations. Our results show that less than 10% of the CXB is contributed by such objects over the energy range 0.5-8 keV. This limit increases to 20% if only hard-band (2-7 keV) photons are considered."}

It was found that the presence of histone H1 leads to an increase in the persistence length of the chain due to formation of loops between neighboring NCPs.

We use Monte Carlo simulations to calculate the density profiles for different values of the wall separation L and particle number N . The results show that the density profile is not affected significantly when increasing the wall separation beyond a certain value which depends on both the temperature T and the particle number N .

{"text":"The response prediction of structural system subject to earthquake motions is very important for the design and construction of buildings in seismic areas, especially when it comes to high-rise building structures. In this study, an artificial neural network (ANN) model was developed by using data obtained through nonlinear dynamic analysis on reinforced concrete frame structure subjected to earthquake ground motion records. The ANN model consists of three layers; input layer, hidden layer with 10 neurons, output layer with one neuron representing maximum inter-story drift ratio. Input variables used are peak ground acceleration, duration time, number of stories, story height, mass density per unit floor area, damping coefficient, yield strength of steel bar, elastic modulus of steel bar, shear wall stiffness, and moment capacity of beam-column joint. To verify the accuracy of the proposed ANN model, results predicted by the ANN were compared with those calculated by nonlinear dynamic analysis program. It can be concluded that the ANN model has good performance in predicting the maximum inter-story drift ratios under various earthquake ground motions."}

{"text":"We present a new method to implement the effect of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) on their host galaxies and surrounding intergalactic medium into hydrodynamical cosmological simulations, which is based on an analytical description of the physical processes involved. The main idea behind our approach is that we use the observed scaling relations between black hole mass, luminosity and velocity dispersion as well as the correlation between radio loudness and Eddington ratio to predict the properties of individual AGNs at each time step during the simulation run. We then inject thermal energy or kinetic momentum into the gas particles around these objects according to their predicted luminosities and velocities. Our implementation allows us to reproduce several observational results such as the M-\u03c3 relation, the fundamental plane of elliptical galaxies, the fraction of red sequence galaxies and the evolution of galaxy clustering with redshift.

{"text":"We study the electrodynamic properties of Josephson vortices (JVs) in hightemperature superconductors by solving numerically the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations with an external magnetic field and current density. We find that JVs can be driven into motion by applying either a dc or ac electric field, which is consistent with previous experiments on YBa2Cu3O7-\u03b4 single crystals. The JV velocity increases linearly as the applied voltage increases for small voltages but saturates at large voltages due to the pinning effect. In addition, we show that the JV velocity decreases when increasing the temperature because of thermal fluctuations. Finally, we demonstrate that the JV dynamics are strongly affected by the anisotropy of the sample. \n \n Introduction \n \n High-temperature superconductivity has been discovered more than 30 years ago [1\u20133] . Since then, many theoretical models have been proposed to explain this phenomenon [4\u20139] , among them the so-called two-fluid model [10] . According to this theory, there exist two different types of charge carriers in these materials, namely electrons and holes [11] . These particles interact via attractive Coulomb forces [12] and form Cooper pairs [13] . When the material undergoes a phase transition below its critical temperature Tc, the Cooper pairs condense into a superfluid state [14] . This leads to macroscopic quantum phenomena such as zero resistance [15] and Meissner effect [16] . \n \n However, it was soon realized that the conventional Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory [17] cannot fully account for all experimental observations [18] . For example, the BCS theory predicts that the energy gap between the ground-state and excited states should decrease rapidly near T = 0 K [19] . On the other hand, recent measurements [20] indicate that the energy gap remains almost constant down to very low temperatures [21] . To overcome this problem, several extensions of the original BCS theory were developed [22\u201324] . Among those theories, one of the most successful ones is the Eliashberg formalism [25] , where the electron-phonon interaction plays an important role [26] . It turns out that"}
{"text":"We report the detection of an infrared dark cloud (IRDC) in the vicinity of the open cluster NGC 6334, using data obtained with Spitzer Space Telescope's Infrared Array Camera (IRAC). The IRDC is associated with the molecular cloud complex G327.3+0.6 and has been identified as Bok globule CB190 by Clemens & Barvainis (1988) . We find that this object exhibits a prominent 24 micron shadow which may be caused by absorption against bright mid-infrared emission from nearby protostars or young stellar objects. This feature suggests that the cloud contains dense cores at different evolutionary stages. Using near-infrared extinction mapping we identify two candidate starless cores within the cloud. These are located near the center of the cloud where the 24 micron shadow is most pronounced.

We show that QKD can be used for this purpose with high efficiency and security in practice by implementing it experimentally.

Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) enables two remote users Alice and Bob to establish a secret key which they use to encrypt messages transmitted over insecure public channels such as the internet or telephone lines [1] . In order to achieve unconditional security against eavesdropping attacks [2] , QKD requires both users to perform measurements on single photons generated at distant locations [3] .\nIn recent years there has been significant progress towards commercialization of QKD systems [4] . However, despite these advances, deployment of QKD remains limited due to its relatively low transmission rates compared to classical cryptography [5] .

{"text":"We present new results on viscous torque and dissipation in thin accretion disks, focusing on their implications for measuring black hole spin using continuum-fitting techniques. We find that the magnitude of the viscous torque is strongly dependent upon the radial location at which it is evaluated; this dependence arises because the disk's surface density profile varies with radius. The net effect is to produce an apparent warp in the inner region of the disk (r < 10 GM\/c2), where the observed flux depends sensitively on the viewing angle. This warp can be misinterpreted as evidence for retrograde precession if one assumes that the disk is axisymmetric. In addition, we show that the total energy dissipated within r = 3 GM\/c2 may exceed the value inferred by fitting the spectrum with a standard Shakura-Sunyaev model.

This has led to renewed interest in studying gravitational backgrounds which admit supersymmetry [1] . One such class of spacetimes is given by the so-called warped product spaces [2] , where the metric takes the form ds2 = e2A(y)(\u03b7\u03bc\u03bddx\u03bc dx\u03bd + dy 2 ),\n(1)\nwhere y denotes the coordinate along the extra dimension, A(y) is called the warp factor and \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd is the Minkowski metric. For example, if we consider the five-dimensional case then this corresponds to the Randall-Sundrum model [3] .\nIn recent years it was shown [4] - [8] that the presence of a nontrivial warp factor leads to new features in the physics associated with fields propagating in the bulk. These include modifications to the standard dispersion relations [9] , spontaneous symmetry breaking [10] , fermion localization [11] , etc.. It turns out [12] that the effects due to the warp factor depend crucially upon its behaviour near the boundary of the extra dimension. If the warp factor vanishes sufficiently rapidly at infinity then all physical observables will be identical to those computed using ordinary flat-space techniques. However, if the warp factor does not vanish fast enough then some novel phenomena occur."}

We find that there is no significant difference between the peak colors or metallicities of metal-rich globular cluster populations hosted by giant elliptical galaxies versus those hosted by dwarf ellipticals. The lack of any dependence of these properties on host galaxy mass suggests that the formation histories of globular clusters are similar across all types of spheroids.

{"text":"We propose that the dark matter (DM) and supersymmetric particles are generated by an emergent gauge symmetry at high energy scales, which is broken down to Standard Model symmetries below TeV scale. The DM candidate can be identified as a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson associated with spontaneous breaking of global U(1) symmetry. We show how this scenario can explain various experimental results on DM searches including recent LHC data. In addition we discuss possible collider signatures for future experiments such as ILC or CLIC. Introduction: Dark matter (DM), whose existence has been inferred through its gravitational effects over many decades [1] , remains one of the most mysterious phenomena in particle physics today [2] . Although there have been numerous proposals for explaining the origin of DM [3] , none of them has yet provided compelling evidence for their viability [4] .\nIn this work, motivated by the idea of \"emergent\" theories [5] - [8] , we consider a new possibility where DM emerges from a spontaneously-broken global symmetry [9] . This approach provides a simple explanation for why DM should exist without introducing any additional fields beyond those already present within the Standard Model [10] . Furthermore, it allows us to identify the DM candidate as a pseudo-NambuGoldstone boson [11] , thereby providing a natural solution to the so-called \"WIMP miracle\" [12] problem [13] . Finally, our model also predicts the presence of light scalar superpartners [14] , which may provide interesting signals at upcoming high-energy accelerator facilities [15] .\nThe rest of this article is organised as follows. In Sec. 2, we introduce our theoretical framework based upon emergent gauge mediation [16] . Then, in Secs. 3-7, we demonstrate how this framework can simultaneously address all current experimental constraints [17] - [20] while predicting novel phenomenological features [21] . Finally, in Sec. 8, we conclude with some remarks about further directions of research."}
{"text":"The electromagnetic properties of high-temperature superconductors are studied in terms of two different theoretical approaches, namely the slave-boson theory (SBT) and the doped carrier theory (DCT). The SBT is based on an effective low-energy description of strongly correlated electrons by means of auxiliary bosonic degrees of freedom which represent collective charge excitations. In this approach we calculate the optical conductivity as well as the Hall coefficient for various values of doping concentration n. We find that both quantities exhibit nontrivial temperature dependence at low temperatures T . On the other hand, within DCT these physical observables can be calculated analytically using simple expressions valid only at zero temperature. Our results show that there exists significant quantitative difference between predictions made by these two models. This discrepancy may serve to discriminate between them experimentally. High-temperature superconductivity has been one of the most challenging problems in condensed matter physics over past decades [1] . Despite enormous experimental efforts [2] , its microscopic origin remains unknown. A number of competing theoretical scenarios have been proposed [3] but none of them could provide a complete explanation of all available data [4] .\nIn particular, it was suggested [5] that the mechanism responsible for high-temperature superconductivity might involve strong electron correlations [6] . These effects cannot be described within conventional Fermi-liquid theory [7, 8] because they lead to non-Fermi liquid behavior [9] such as power-law dependences of thermodynamic functions [10] or unusual transport phenomena [11] . To account for these features theoretically, several phenomenological models were developed [12] including the so-called slave-boson theory [13] . It describes the dynamics of strongly interacting fermions with spin S = 1\/2 coupled to an additional set of bosonic fields representing collective charge fluctuations [14] . Within this framework, the ground state of the system corresponds to a Bose-Einstein condensation [15] of the bosons [16] . As a result, the fermionic quasiparticles acquire finite masses [17] leading to their disappearance above some critical temperature [18] ."}

{"text":"We consider the problem of quantizing an arbitrary vector in a Grassmannian manifold to minimize its distortion under a given rate constraint, which is relevant for multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) communications systems employing feedback. We derive upper bounds on the minimum achievable distortion as well as lower bounds on the corresponding optimal rates by using information-theoretic tools such as entropy power inequalities and data processing inequalities. Our results show that the performance gap between these two bounds increases when the dimension of the underlying Grassmannian manifold grows large. Finally, we provide numerical examples illustrating our theoretical findings. The work presented here was supported by NSF Grant CCF-0635035. Multi-input-multi-output communication systems are widely used in wireless networks due to their high spectral efficiency [1] . In this context, it has been shown recently [2] , that the use of limited-rate feedback can significantly improve system performance at low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). However, the amount of available feedback resources may be severely constrained in practice [3] .\nIn order to reduce the required feedback overhead while maintaining good performance, one approach consists of exploiting channel state information (CSI), i.e., knowledge about the current fading coefficients, to perform joint encoding across multiple transmit antennas [4] - [6] . This technique, known as spatial multiplexing or beamforming, requires CSI at both transmitter and receiver sides. Since acquiring perfect CSI at the transmitter side through training-based schemes typically involves significant signaling overhead [7] , practical implementations often resort to quantized versions of the true CSI [8]- [10] . Therefore, there exists a trade-off between the accuracy of the transmitted signals and the amount of feedback needed to convey them [11] .\nThe design of efficient transmission strategies over MIMO channels with limited feedback remains an open research area [12] .

In addition, each transmitter may turn off its radio completely when it does not have any data to send. The objective is to maximize the sum rate by optimizing both the power control policy as well as the transmission strategy for all users simultaneously under these constraints. \n \n First, we derive an upper bound on the achievable sum-rate using finite-rate feedback assuming Gaussian codebooks.

{"text":"In this work, we study the problem of how many users to turn on for multi-antenna broadcast channels (MABCs). We first show that the optimal number of active users is equal to the rank of the channel matrix when all users have the same average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and there are no power constraints at the base station. Then, under general conditions, we prove that the optimal number of users is upper bounded by the minimum between the rank of the channel and the total number of available transmit antennas. Finally, we provide an algorithm which can find the exact solution within polynomial time complexity. The results obtained here may help us design more efficient MABC systems with reduced computational cost. In wireless communications, broadcasting refers to sending information simultaneously to multiple receivers over a shared medium such as radio waves or fiber optics. This type of communication has been widely used in various applications including digital television, video conferencing, data transmission, etc., where it is desirable to send messages to several users simultaneously [1] . However, due to limited resources, only a subset of these users will receive useful signals while others experience interference [2] .\nThe main challenge in designing broadcast systems lies in determining the best set of users who should be turned on so that each user receives its intended message without causing too much interference to other users [3] , i.e., finding the optimal user selection strategy [4] - [6] . For example, if one wants to maximize the sum rate of all users subject to individual power constraints, then the optimal user selection strategy depends not only on the channel state information but also on the power allocation policy [7] . Therefore, the joint optimization of user selection and power control becomes very complicated [8] ."}

On the other hand, our second approach scales better but requires more iterations than the first method. Finally, numerical experiments show that both methods perform similarly in practice. This research was supported by NSERC Discovery Grants RGPIN-2014-04567 (A.S.) and RGPIN-2016-05189 (M.D.). \nIntroduction\n\nLet $Gr(k,n)$ denote the Grassmannian manifold consisting of all $k$-dimensional subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^n$. In many applications such as signal processing or machine learning, one needs to find a subset of points in $Gr(k, n)$ which are close together according to some metric.  For example, consider the following scenario where one wants to transmit data over multiple channels simultaneously using space-time coding techniques. Here, the transmitter encodes information into a vector of symbols drawn from a finite alphabet $\\mathcal{A}$. Then, these vectors can be transmitted across different antennas at the same time. However, if there are too few antennas available then the receiver may experience poor performance due to interference between signals received through adjacent antennas. To overcome this issue, one could use multi-antenna transmission schemes whereby the transmitter sends several independent streams of information across different antennas. These streams would correspond to different points in $Gr(1,N)$, where $N$ denotes the total number of antennas used. Another application involves compressive sensing problems where one seeks to recover a sparse vector $x$ from its noisy measurements $y$ given by: $$y = Ax + w$$"}

Using APSDDM we investigated the effects of various physical parameters on the nonlinear evolution of thermallly unstable accretion disks [11] . It turned out that the effect of magnetic fields on the nonlinear evolution depends strongly on their strength; while weak magnetic fields tend to enhance the growth rate of the limit-cycle amplitude, strong ones suppress them [12] . \nIn this work we continue our investigation into the nonlinear evolution of thermaly unstable accretion disks by considering the case where the viscosity parameter \u03b1 = 0.1.

{"text":"We study the weighted complexity function W(G) for graphs G with n vertices, which is defined as the minimum number of edges in any n-vertex subgraph H such that H contains all cycles of length at most k (k = 3, ...,n). We prove upper bounds on this function by using the concept of the determinant of an adjacency matrix A associated to G. In particular we show that if A has no zero rows or columns then W(G) <= 2n-1. This bound can be improved when A satisfies some additional conditions. Finally, we give examples showing how our results are sharp. The weighted complexity function W(G;k) (k=3,...,n), introduced by Chartrand et al., measures the minimum number of edges needed to make every cycle of length up to k in a given graph G. It was shown recently that W(G;3)=n-2 for any connected triangle-free planar graph G. In this note we improve these results by proving that W(G;3))<=n-1 for any connected triangle-free plane graph G."}

{"text":"We report on the measurement and analysis of phase-resolved spontaneous emission in an optically pumped semiconductor laser with external cavity feedback (ECF). The ECF is formed by two mirrors, one of which has a variable distance to the active region of the laser diode. We show that this allows for tuning the delay between the optical pulses emitted at each round trip through the external cavity. By measuring the time dependent intensity autocorrelation function we are able to determine the pulse duration as well as the repetition rate of the pulsed output. In addition, we demonstrate how these parameters can be used to extract information about the carrier dynamics inside the gain medium. \n \n A detailed description of the experimental setup together with results obtained under different operating conditions will be presented. Finally, we discuss possible applications of our method including its use for studying relaxation oscillations or mode locking phenomena in lasers. Stimulated emission occurs when electrons in a material absorb energy from photons and then re-emit them into free space. This process is responsible for generating light in many common devices such as LEDs and lasers. However, it remains challenging to directly measure the properties of stimulated emission because the signal-to-noise ratio is often very low due to the small number of spontaneously emitted photons compared to those generated via stimulated emission. Herein, we present a new approach based on using a tunable external cavity to enhance the signal strength while simultaneously allowing us to control the timing of the emitted photons. Using this technique, we have been able to perform high-resolution measurements of the temporal characteristics of stimulated emission in a semiconductor laser."}

We find that this sunspot is composed of several magnetic flux tubes with different orientations. In addition to these features we also observe an extended bright feature located between the main sunspot umbrae. This feature has been previously reported as a penumbral filament but our data show no evidence of such structure. Instead, we interpret this feature as a coronal rain blob. The second sunspot was observed for only 1 hour before being occulted by Earths atmosphere. During this observation period the sunspot rotated by less than 30 degrees.

{"text":"We present new results on mass loss in carbon rich asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars based on infrared photometry obtained with ISO-SWS, IRAS, MSX and Spitzer-IRS. We find that there is no correlation between the total luminosity or effective temperature of these objects and their mass-loss rates. The observed scatter may be explained by differences in chemical composition and\/or pulsation properties among individual sources. In addition to this we show that the dust-to-gas ratio decreases towards higher temperatures for oxygen-rich as well as carbon-rich AGB stars. This indicates that the physical conditions at which dust forms are different in both types of evolved stars. Finally, we discuss how our findings can be used to improve current models describing the evolution of red giants. Keywords: Asymptotic Giant Branch Stars; Dust formation; Red Giants; Mass loss. 1 Introduction Carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch (AGB; hereafter Crich AGB) stars have been studied extensively over the past decades because they represent an important source class of interstellar matter. They lose large amounts of material through stellar winds driven by radiation pressure on dust grains formed in the outflowing gas. These winds play an essential role in shaping circumstellar envelopes around evolved stars and thus influence the appearance of planetary nebulae and proto-stellar disks surrounding young stellar objects. However, despite numerous observational studies it remains unclear what determines the amount of mass lost by Crich AGB stars. It has been suggested that the total luminosity L * , the effective temperature T eff , the surface gravity g, the metallicity Z, the pulsation period P, and the initial mass M ini might all affect\u1e40 . For example, Wood et al. (1992) , van Loon et al. (1999), Olofsson et al. (2002a) , Knapp & Morris (1985) , and Winters et al.

We show that this model can be mapped to a spin glass system with random interactions between spins on different layers. Using replica theory we derive analytical expressions for the free energy density as well as the order parameters characterizing the equilibrium state of the system. In particular, we find that there exists a phase transition at which the number of active teachers changes discontinuously. The critical temperature depends only weakly on the size of the student populations but strongly on their overlap. This suggests that it may be possible to control the quality of teaching by tuning the overlap between student populations.

{"text":"We present an explicit construction for a massive gauge theory with spontaneous symmetry breaking, which is based on the nonlinearly realized gauge group. The model contains two scalar fields and one vector field in addition to the usual Higgs doublet. We show that this model can be obtained by gauging the global SU(2)LxSU(2)R chiral symmetry of the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model. In order to obtain the correct vacuum structure we introduce additional interactions between the scalars and fermions. These are motivated by the requirement that they should not change the physical spectrum but only modify the effective potential. This leads us to consider four different types of interaction terms. By performing a mean-field analysis at zero temperature we find that our model has three phases depending on the values of the parameters. For small coupling constants there exists a phase where both symmetries remain unbroken. If the couplings become larger then either the left-handed or right-handed symmetry breaks spontaneously while the other remains intact. Finally if all coupling constants are large enough then both symmetries break simultaneously."}
{"text":"We present an exact solution for the nonequilibrium dynamics of a two-level system coupled to fermionic reservoirs in terms of a Coulomb gas model defined on the Keldysch contour. The partition function is expressed as a functional integral over complex fields, which are related to the density matrix and current operators by means of a Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation. We show that this formulation allows us to obtain explicit expressions for the time evolution of observables such as the occupation probabilities and currents through the junction between the leads and the central region. In particular we find that the relaxation towards equilibrium occurs via damped oscillations whose frequency depends on the bias voltage across the junction. This behavior can be understood within a simple rate equation approach. Finally, we discuss how our results may be generalized to more complicated systems with multiple levels or spin degrees of freedom. \nI. INTRODUCTORY REMARK\nThe study of transport properties of mesoscopic devices has attracted considerable attention during recent years due to their potential applications in quantum information processing [1] . A particularly interesting class of problems concerns the description of charge transfer processes taking place at low temperatures when the electronic states involved in the process are localized near Fermi surfaces [2] .\nIn order to describe these phenomena one usually considers models where electrons tunnel coherently between different regions (leads) connected by some scattering center [3] , e.g., a single level [4] or multi-level [5] impurity. These models have been studied extensively using various techniques ranging from perturbation theory [6] to numerical methods [7, 8] . However, it turns out that many important features cannot be captured by perturbative approaches [9] while standard numerical schemes suffer from severe limitations [10] . For example, they do not allow to treat large systems and\/or strong interactions [11] . Therefore, new theoretical tools are needed to understand the physics behind these phenomena [12] .\nRecently, there has been growing interest in developing analytical solutions for non-equilibrium transport problems based on mapping them onto effective statistical mechanics models [13] . One of the most successful examples of this kind is provided by the so-called Caldeira-Leggett model [14] describing the interaction of"}
{"text":"We propose an efficient scheme to protect the coherence in open systems against general nonMarkovian noise by continuous quantum error correction (CQEC). The CQEC protocol is implemented with two-level atoms and driven cavity fields, which are coupled via Jaynes-Cummings interaction. We show that this system can be described as a Markovian process under certain conditions. In particular, we find that the decay rate of each atom-cavity subsystem should satisfy ${\\gamma}_i \\ll g$ where $g$ denotes the coupling strength between neighboring cavities. By using the master equation approach, we derive analytical expressions for the fidelity of the state transfer through the network. Our results indicate that the fidelity decays exponentially if there exists at least one pair of cavities whose decay rates violate the above condition. However, when all the decay rates fulfill it, the fidelity remains constant over time."}
{"text":"We prove that the set of all polynomials in one variable with integer coefficients is uniquely representable as a sum of squares of rational functions, and we give an explicit algorithm for computing such representation.  We also show how to extend this result to multivariate polynomials over finite fields. The problem of representing a given polynomial as a sum of squares (SOS) has been studied extensively since Hilbert's 19th century work on quadratic forms. In particular, it was shown by Artin that every nonnegative integer can be represented as a sum of four squares of integers; see [1] . This theorem implies that any positive integer n can be written as a sum of at most 4 square roots of integers. However, there are infinitely many ways to write each number as a sum of two or three square roots of integers. For example, 1 = 2 + \u221a 3 , but also 1 = 2 \u2212 \u221a 3 .\nThe uniqueness question becomes more interesting when restricted to certain classes of polynomials. It turns out that if f \u2208 Z[x] is a monic polynomial whose Galois group G(f ) is solvable then f is uniquely representable as SOS [2] . On the other hand, if G(f ) contains a nonsolvable subgroup then f may have several distinct SOS representations [3] ."}
{"text":"We consider strings propagating on curved backgrounds, with emphasis on their role as sigma-models. We show that the world-sheet action for such strings can be written in terms of an auxiliary field which is related to the extrinsic curvature of the target space. This allows us to study string propagation by solving the equations of motion for this auxiliary field instead of directly solving the equation of motion for the embedding coordinates. In particular we discuss how this approach simplifies calculations when studying strings in AdS spaces or near black holes. Finally, we use our formalism to investigate the behavior of strings at high energies where they become tensionless. We find that these strings are described by a conformal theory whose central charge vanishes. The corresponding Virasoro generators have negative norm states so that the Hilbert space has indefinite metric. These results provide further evidence that tensionless strings may play an important r\u00f4le in understanding quantum gravity."}
{"text":"We study the effects of electron-lattice coupling on charge order (CO) and superconductivity (SC)\nin the organic conductor $\\theta-(ET)_{2}X$, where X is an alkaline earth metal or rare earth metal.  We find that CO can be suppressed by applying pressure to the system while SC survives up to high pressures. The suppression of CO leads to a decrease in the electronic anisotropy which may explain why SC becomes more robust under pressure. In addition we show how the competition between CO and SC depends strongly on the lattice structure. Finally, we discuss possible experimental consequences of our results for the recently discovered iron-based superconductors. Introduction:-Charge ordering has been observed in many families of correlated materials such as transition-metal oxides [1] , heavy fermion compounds [2] , and organics [3] . It often competes with other ordered states like antiferromagnetism [4] and superconductivity [5] .\nIn this work we focus on the effect of electron-lattice interactions on charge ordering and superconductivity in the family of organic conductors known as theta-(ET)_{2}X; here ET stands for ethylenedithio-tetrathiafulvalene [6] . These are layered systems consisting of alternating stacks of conducting layers made out of ET molecules and insulating layers made out of bulky cations [7, 8] . Depending on the choice of the cation these materials exhibit different physical properties ranging from metallic behavior at ambient conditions [9] over semiconducting [10] and Mott-insulating [11] phases to superconductivity [12] . For example, when X=Ca, Sr, Ba, Yb, or Ce, the material behaves as a semiconductor below room temperature but shows metallic behavior above it [13] . On the other hand, if X=Pb, Tl, K, Na, or Li then the material remains metallic down to low temperatures [14] . Superconductivity was first reported in the compound $\\Theta-(ET)_{2}PbF_{4}$ [15] and later found also in several other members of the series [16] ."}
{"text":"We study the decoherence dynamics of a spin system with ${\\sim}10^4$ spins, which is realized by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments on liquid-state samples. We show that the observed relaxation behavior can be explained by taking into account environmental effects such as spin-spin interactions and chemical shifts. In particular, we find that the environment induces a quantum dynamical phase transition at low temperatures, where the decay rate of the off-diagonal elements of the density matrix becomes faster than its diagonal counterpart. This leads to a rapid loss of coherence even for small perturbations. Our results provide new insights into the understanding of macroscopic quantum phenomena in open quantum systems. Decoherence plays a crucial role in our understanding of how macroscopic objects behave classically despite their microscopic quantum nature [1] . It has been studied extensively both theoretically [2] and experimentally [3] , especially in connection with quantum information processing [4] .\nIn this Letter, we report experimental studies of decoherence dynamics in a large number of interacting spins using nuclear magnetic resonance (N MR). The experiment was performed on a sample containing ${\\sim}10^{4} $ protons dissolved in water [5] . By measuring the longitudinal relaxation time T 1 [6] and transverse relaxation times T 2 [7] , we found that the relaxation rates are strongly dependent on temperature [8] . At high temperatures, they follow the standard Arrhenius law [9] . However, below a certain critical temperature T c , the relaxation rates increase rapidly [10] . As shown in Figs. 1a-1c [11] , the measured relaxation rates exhibit power-law behaviors [12] \nwhere A 0 and B 0 are constants determined by fitting Eq. (1) to the data points [13] . These observations suggest that there exists a quantum dynamical phase transition [14] between two different phases [15] : one is characterized by slow relaxation processes [16] , while the other exhibits fast relaxation [17] ."}

{"text":"We present an extension of the Continuous Time Random Walk (CTRW) formalism to describe non-Markovian processes in terms of a stochastic Liouville equation with memory kernel. The latter is obtained by solving the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation for the probability distribution function, which can be done analytically only under certain conditions on the form of the memory kernel. We show that this problem can be overcome by introducing a new concept of \"stochastic propagator\", which allows us to obtain exact solutions even when the memory kernel does not have any particular functional dependence on time or space variables. Finally we discuss how our results are related to previous works based on fractional calculus techniques. In recent years there has been growing interest in studying systems whose dynamics cannot be described within the standard framework of Markovian processes [1] . This is mainly due to the fact that many physical phenomena exhibit complex temporal behavior characterized by power law relaxation [2] , aging [3] , intermittency [4] , etc., all of them being typical features of nonMarkovian processes [5] .\nIn order to deal with these problems it was proposed [6] to use the so-called Continuous Time Random Walk (CWTRW) formalism [7, 8] . Within such a description one considers a system evolving continuously in time according to some deterministic laws but interrupted at random times by jumps between different states. These jumps occur as a consequence of interactions with other degrees of freedom, e.g. phonons [9] , electrons [10] , photons [11] , etc.. As shown in Ref. [12] , the CWTRW formalism provides a very general description of non-Markovian dynamics since it includes both discrete state models [13] and fractional diffusion equations [14] as special cases. However, despite its great flexibility, the application of the CWTRW formal-"}

{"text":"We study the cosmological evolution in regular homogeneous T-models filled by a perfect fluid and a vacuum energy density term, which is responsible for an accelerated expansion at late times.  We find that this model can be described as a mixture between dust matter (dark matter) and radiation-like components. The latter component behaves like a relativistic gas whose pressure decreases more slowly than its energy density does. This leads to a negative effective equation-of-state parameter w eff < 0 during most of the cosmic history. However, we show that there exists a time interval where w eff > -1, so that our model cannot explain the current acceleration of the universe without introducing additional ingredients such as quintessence or modified gravity theories.

The light curve shows that it is an overluminous event with respect to normal SNe Ia at all epochs after maximum brightness. We find no evidence for any significant decline in luminosity over the past two years since explosion.  This behaviour contrasts sharply with other well-studied SNe Ia such as SN 1991bg or SN 1999br , where there has been a rapid drop-off in luminosity within one year following peak brightness. In addition we have obtained spectroscopic data covering the period between +100 days and +1000 days post-explosion.

{"text":"We report on the fabrication and characterization of electro-optically tunable microresonator devices based on proton exchange (PE) grown lithium niobate-on-insulator substrates. The PE process is used to create an optical waveguide with low loss, high index contrast, and large nonlinearity within the substrate material. A ring-resonator geometry is then defined by electron-beam lithography followed by reactive ion etching. Finally, Ti\/Au electrodes are deposited onto both sides of the device for electrical tuning. We demonstrate continuous wavelength tuning over more than 30 nm at 1555 nm using only 1 V reverse bias applied across the device. This work represents one step towards realizing electrically-tuned integrated photonic circuits that can be monolithically fabricated on insulators. Lithium niobate has been widely studied as a promising candidate for optoelectronics applications due to its excellent properties such as wide transparency range, large second-order susceptibility, and relatively low propagation losses [1] . In addition, it also exhibits strong piezoelectric and pyroelectric effects which make it possible to achieve efficient electro-optic modulation [2] .\nIn this letter we present our recent results on the development of electro-optically tuned microring resonators made out of lithium niobate. These devices were designed and fabricated on commercially available lithium niobate wafers bonded to silicon dioxide [3] , where the top cladding layer was removed prior to processing. First, a proton-exchange (PE) process [4] was performed to grow a single-mode ridge-waveguide structure inside the bulk LiNbO 3 crystal [5] . Then, a ring-resonator geometry was patterned into the PE-grown region via electron beam lithography [6] . Finally, titanium\/gold (Ti\/Au) contacts were evaporated onto both sides of the sample to provide electrical access to the device [7, 8] . Figure 1 shows scanning-electron-microscope images of two different types of microring resonators that have been successfully demonstrated so far. Both devices consist of"}
{"text":"The present work is devoted to the study of nonlinear generalized functions in connection with the foundations of quantum field theory (QFT). The main results are as follows:  1) We show that the concept of nonlinear generalized function can be used for constructing an alternative approach to QFT, which does not use any additional axioms beyond those of standard relativistic quantum mechanics.  2) In this approach we introduce new mathematical objects - nonlinear generalized fields, which play the role similar to that played by usual quantum fields in conventional QFT. 3) We prove that these new fields satisfy all basic properties required for them to serve as fundamental building blocks of QFT. 4) We also demonstrate how our formalism allows one to obtain the Feynman rules for calculating various physical quantities within the framework of QFT. 5) Finally, using the developed formalism, we derive some important relations between different Green's functions appearing in QFT."}
{"text":"We compute the genus-one GW invariants for smooth hypersurface Calabi--Yau threefolds in weighted projective spaces, using degeneration techniques and mirror symmetry. We show that these invariants are determined by certain combinatorial data associated to the singular fibers of the degenerating family. This is done by relating our results with those obtained previously on toric varieties via the SYZ conjecture. The main result we prove here is an explicit formula expressing the reduced genus-one GW invariants as sums over products of Schubert classes. As applications, we give formulas for computing the number of rational curves passing through prescribed points or tangent to given divisors.

{"text":"The production of light elements in the early universe is one of the most important unsolved problems in astrophysics, cosmology, nuclear physics and particle physics. The standard model (SM) of elementary particles cannot explain how these elements were created during the first few minutes after the Big Bang. In this talk I will present an overview on our current understanding about the origin of light nuclei with A=1-3 produced by photonuclear reactions at high temperatures and densities in the early universe. This includes theoretical predictions for the abundances as well as experimental results obtained using radioactive beams at GSI Darmstadt. Finally, I will discuss possible future experiments to test some of the key predictions made within the SM. Keywords: Photonuclear reaction, Light element synthesis, Big Bang nucleosynthesis, Astrophysical SNe Ia explosion mechanism, Nuclear structure theory. 1 Introduction.\nLight element synthesis in the early universe is among the most challenging open questions in modern science [1] . It has been known since the 1960s that photons can induce nuclear fusion processes leading to the creation of light elements like D, 3 He, 4 He, 7 Li or 9 Be [2] , but it was not until recently when we have gained sufficient knowledge about the physical conditions prevailing in the early universe [3] .\nIn particular, the temperature T and density \u03c1 reached values up to 10 12 K and 10 15 g\/cm 3 respectively [4] . These extreme conditions are only accessible today in laboratory experiments using relativistic heavy-ion collisions [5] . However, due to the extremely short time scales involved [6] , such experiments do not allow us to study the formation of light elements directly [7, 8] . Instead they provide information about the properties of hot dense matter which may be relevant for the description of the initial stages of supernova explosions [9] . On the other hand, the abundance pattern observed in primordial objects like white dwarfs [10] or metal-poor stars [11] provides valuable constraints on the models describing the evolution of the chemical composition of the universe [12] ."}

The 2PCF is an important statistical tool in many fields, including physics and engineering sciences. In this work we show how to use it as a basis for describing complex systems with multiple components or phases. We demonstrate that the 2PCF can be used to describe both static and dynamic properties of such systems. Finally, we discuss some applications of our approach. This article is part of a series on \"Multiscale Modeling\" published by Frontiers in Physics. \nIntroduction\n\nTwo-point correlation function (2PCF) is one of the most fundamental concepts in statistics [1] . It has been widely applied across various disciplines ranging from physics [2] , chemistry [3] , biology [4] , geology [5] , medicine [6] , economics [7] , sociology [8] , etc., to engineering [9] .\nIn recent years there have been several attempts to apply the concept of 2PCF to multiscale modeling [10 -12] . However, these works are mostly focused on developing new numerical methods rather than providing physical insights into the problem at hand. Herein, we propose a novel method based on the concept of 2PCFs which allows us to model heterogeneous materials consisting of different components and\/or phases. Our approach provides a general framework for studying the structure-property relationships in such systems. Moreover, it enables us to study their dynamics over a wide range of time scales. \n \n To illustrate the main idea behind our approach let us consider a simple example shown schematically in Figure 1 . Suppose we want to investigate the mechanical response of a composite material made up of three distinct components A, B, C arranged in a periodic manner. Each component consists of randomly distributed spherical particles embedded within a matrix phase. For simplicity, assume that all components have identical volume fractions f = 0.33 but differ in terms of particle size distribution.

{"text":"We propose an efficient reduced complexity sphere decoding (RSD) algorithm for square quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM). The proposed RSD is based on the new lattice representation, which can be viewed as a generalization of the well-known real-valued lattice representation to complex-valued lattices. We show that our RSD has lower computational complexity than existing algorithms in terms of both number of arithmetic operations and memory requirement. In addition, we demonstrate by simulation results that our RSD achieves better bit error rate performance over conventional RSDs at high signal-to-noise ratio region. Finally, we provide some insights into how to further reduce the computational complexity of our RSD without sacrificing its BER performance. Index Terms - Reduced complexity sphere decoding, Quadrature amplitude modulation, Computational complexity reduction, Bit error rate performance improvement. I. INTRODUCTIO N Quadrature amplitude modulation (Q AM ) [1] , also known as phase-shift keying (PSK), is one of the most popular digital modulations used in wireless communications due to its simple implementation [2] . However, it suffers from poor power efficiency when compared with other high-order constellations such as 16-QAM or 64-QAM [3] .\nIn order to improve the power efficiency while maintaining good bit error rate (BER) performance, many research efforts have been made recently [4] - [8] . Among them, reduced complexity sphere decoding (RCSD) [9] - [11] plays an important role because RCSD provides near optimal BER performance with much less computational complexity than maximum-likelihood detection [12] . For example, the authors in [10] developed a novel RCSD scheme for square QAM using the so-called real-valued lattice representation [13] . It was shown in [14] that this approach requires only about half of the number of arithmetic operations required by the original RCSD [15] . Moreover, the authors in [16] showed that their RCSD outperforms the previous works [17] , [19] in terms of BER performance under various channel conditions. Although these approaches are very promising, they still suffer from relatively large computational complexity especially at low-to-medium SNR"}

{"text":"We present an analysis of the evolution in the luminosity function (LF) and colour-magnitude relation (CMR) of galaxies selected by their rest-frame optical colours, using data from three large multi-wavelength surveys covering different areas on the sky. The first is the Spitzer Wide-area InfraRed Extragalactic survey (SWIRE), which covers about one quarter of the southern hemisphere at 24 microns with MIPS; the second is the VIMOS Very Deep Survey (VVDS), which has been carried out as part of the CFHT Legacy Survey (CFHTLS). This provides deep photometry in five bands to AB magnitude limits ranging from 26.5 to 27.7 mags in the u*gri filters. Finally we use near-infrared imaging obtained with WIRCam mounted on the Canada France Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) to select samples of massive galaxies at 1<z<1.4. We find that the LF evolves strongly towards fainter magnitudes since z=1.2, while there are no significant changes in its shape or normalisation.

{"text":"We present an analysis of optical and infrared photometric data obtained during the recent (2006-2008) outbursts of the dwarf novae system V2051 Oph, which is one of only three known to have exhibited both superoutbursts and normal outbursts in its lifetime.  We find that the light curve of this object shows many similarities with those observed for other SU UMa-type systems but also some significant differences. In particular we note that there are no clear signs of rebrightening following either the first or second superoutburst; nor do we see any evidence for a double-humped structure in the light curves at all phases of these events. The lack of such features may be due to the fact that our observations were made when the system was relatively faint compared to previous studies. However, it should be noted that the orbital period of V2051 Oph is significantly longer than most other SU UMa stars so that the mass transfer rate will be lower by about a factor of ten."}
{"text":"We consider the possibility that our universe is described by a brane world model with an arbitrary number of dimensions, but no reflection symmetry across any of them.  We show how to construct such models and discuss their phenomenological consequences for cosmology and particle physics. In particular we find that there are two classes of solutions which can be distinguished by whether or not they contain closed timelike curves (CTCs). The first class contains CTCs while the second does not. For both cases we calculate the effective four dimensional Planck mass as well as the masses of Kaluza-Klein excitations on the brane.

INTRODU CTION\n\nThe idea that our universe may have more than three spatial dimensions has been around since the early days of general relativity [1] , when it was realized that Einstein's field equations admit solutions with extra dimensions [2] .\nIn recent years this idea has received renewed interest due to developments in string theory [3] where it appears naturally [4] . String theoretic constructions typically involve compactification of higher-dimensional space-times down to lower ones [5] - [8] . However, even if one starts out with a ten-or eleven-dimensional background solution, the resulting low energy description will generically include additional fields living in the bulk [9] - [11] . These fields couple to matter localized on the branes [12] giving rise to new effects at low energies [13] - [16] .\nOne particularly interesting feature of many braneworld scenarios [17] - [20] is the presence of time-like singularities [21] - [23] . Such singularities arise whenever the volume of some internal dimension shrinks to zero size [24] . They lead to problems with causality [25] unless the corresponding time coordinate is identified periodically [26] . If this identification is done in a way consistent with supersymmetry then the singularities disappear [27] . Alternatively, one could try to resolve the singularities using quantum gravity [28]"}
{"text":"We consider the problem of learning an unknown distribution over binary strings, where each string is generated by sampling independently at random with replacement according to some fixed probability vector . We show that if we are given samples drawn iid from , then it can be learned in polynomial time using standard statistical techniques (e.g., maximum likelihood). However, when the number of possible values for each bit grows large, this approach fails because there may not exist any sample which contains all possible values for every bit. In such cases, we propose a novel algorithm based on Gibbs sampling and prove its correctness under certain conditions. Finally, we present experimental results demonstrating our method's effectiveness. The main contribution of this work lies in showing how to learn distributions over combinatorial objects like graphs and trees. This is achieved by first reducing these problems into learning distributions over binary strings, and then applying our proposed algorithms. Learning distributions over combinatorial objects has many applications including data mining, computer vision, bioinformatics, etc. ."}
{"text":"We study the effect of random large-scale forcing on three-dimensional rotating stratified flows, using direct numerical simulations (DNS) with periodic boundary conditions. The flow is forced at large scales by adding to the momentum equation an external force that has zero mean but whose Fourier transform contains both positive and negative wavenumbers. We find that this type of forcing excites two distinct types of modes in the system: vortical and wave-like modes. Vortical modes are characterized by strong vertical motions concentrated near the center of the domain; they have low horizontal velocities and their kinetic energy decays rapidly as we move away from the center. On the other hand, wave-like modes are characterized by weak vertical motions distributed over larger regions of space; they have high horizontal velocities and their kinetic energies decay slowly or even increase slightly when moving away from the center. In addition, these waves can be either stationary or propagating horizontally depending on whether the forcing spectrum peaks at small or large horizontal wavenumber respectively."}

In particular, we find that there exist two classes of such solutions depending on whether they contain a \"dynamo region\" where the magnetic energy density grows exponentially fast (and thus cannot be matched onto any solution at spatial infinity) or not. The latter class contains all known stationary axisymmetric black hole electrovacuum solutions.

We have analyzed four transiting exoplanet systems, HD 189733b, HD 209458b, WASP-12b and XO-1b, which are known to be strongly irradiated by their host stars. The IR spectra were obtained during secondary eclipse events when the planet passes behind its star as seen from Earth. Our results show that all these planets exhibit strong absorption features at wavelengths longer than 5 microns due to water vapor in their atmospheres. These observations provide direct evidence for the presence of water vapor in highly-irradiated planetary atmospheres.  Keywords: Exoplanet, Transmission spectrum, Secondary eclipse, Water vapor, Infrared spectrophotometry, Spitzer Space Telescope. 1 Introduction   Water is one of the most important molecules in our Solar System because it plays an essential role in life processes. It has been detected in many different environments ranging from comets to icy satellites such as Europa or Enceladus. However, despite numerous efforts over several decades, no unambiguous detection of water had yet been reported outside our Solar System until recently. This situation changed dramatically thanks to space-based observatories like Hubble Space Telescope (HST), Chandra X-ray Observatory, and especially Spitzer Space Telescope (Werner et al., 2004) .  Since its launch in 2003, Spitzer has observed thousands of targets including hundreds of extrasolar planets. Among them, there are some very interesting cases where the planet orbits close to its parent star so that the intense stellar radiation heats up the atmosphere of the planet significantly. As a result, the atmospheric composition can change drastically compared to what we know about terrestrial planets in our Solar System. For example, if the temperature becomes high enough, hydrogen could escape from the planet's upper atmosphere into space leaving only helium behind (Lammer et al., 2003; Baraffe et al., 2004; Yelle et al., 2006) , while other species may condense out onto"}
{"text":"We propose to use hierarchical hidden Markov random fields (HHMRFs) as the underlying model in an unsupervised segmentation algorithm for hyperspectral images.

Finally, we compare our results against those obtained using state-of-the-art algorithms based on Gaussian mixture models or sparse coding techniques. \nIntroduction\n\nHyperspectral imaging has become increasingly popular during recent years due to advances in sensor technology [1] . In contrast to conventional color cameras which capture only three bands per pixel, hyperspectral sensors can record hundreds of narrow spectral bands simultaneously [2] , leading to high-dimensional data volumes. This poses new challenges both in terms of storage requirements and computational complexity [3] .\nIn many applications it would be desirable to perform automatic analysis of such large amounts of data without any prior knowledge about the scene being observed [4] .

{"text":"The nonperiodic anyon model is introduced as an alternative to the periodic one in order to explain fractional quantum hall effect (FQHE). The ground state wave function for this system is obtained by using the method of projection operators, which leads to a new expression for the Laughlin wave functions.

This result shows that the nonperiodic anyons can be considered as charged particles moving on a sphere.

{"text":"We study the quantization of soliton systems in terms of their associated integrable hierarchies, which are infinite-dimensional Lie algebras with an underlying Poisson structure.  We show that these hierarchies can be realized as certain coadjoint orbits of loop groups over complex semisimple Lie groups.   The resulting quantum theories have many interesting features including nontrivial anomalies and non-perturbative effects such as instantons.    In particular we find that the partition functions for these models are closely related to automorphic forms on the corresponding groups; this is known as the Langlands correspondence between representations of the two groups.   This provides a new perspective on the relationship between gauge theory and string theory; it also suggests a possible connection between the Standard Model and M-theory. Solitons play important roles in physics ranging from condensed matter to particle and nuclear physics. They appear naturally in various physical contexts where nonlinear interactions occur, e.g., in fluid dynamics or field theories describing particles interacting via Yukawa potentials (e.g., quarks). A particularly rich class of solitonic solutions arises when one considers integrable systems whose equations of motion admit Lax pairs. These systems include classical mechanics, relativistic field theories, and supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories. Integrability implies that there exist infinitely many conserved quantities and allows us to construct exact solutions using inverse scattering techniques. It has been shown recently by Witten [1] , however, that even though most physically relevant systems cannot be solved exactly, they may still exhibit some aspects of integrability at the quantum level.

Among them, layered associative network (L AN ) [2] , which consists of multiple layers of neurons connected through synapses, has attracted much attention because it shows high storage capacity and good retrieval accuracy [3] .\nIn L AN s, each neuron receives inputs from all neurons in previous layer via synaptic connections. Then, the activity level of each neuron is determined by its firing rate according to the following equation: \nwhere x i denotes the activity level of ith neuron at time t, w ij represents connection weight from jth neuron in previous layer to ith neuron in current layer, f(\u00b7) stands for activation function, and b i indicates bias term [4] . Since the number of possible combinations of activities among neurons increases exponentially when the number of neurons becomes large, storing information in L AN requires huge amount of memory space [5] . To overcome this problem, several approaches have been suggested [6] - [8] .

{"text":"We propose that galactic dark matter is an effective four-dimensional manifestation of extra dimensions, and we show how this can be realized in a simple model with one extra dimension compactified on S 1 \/Z 2 . The fifth dimension has two 3-branes at its endpoints which are connected by a bulk scalar field. We find that the scalar field develops a kink profile along the fifth dimension due to the presence of a potential barrier between the two branes. This leads to a localized mass term for fermions living on the visible (3-)brane, which gives rise to a phenomenologically viable dark matter candidate. In addition, there exists another class of particles called Kaluza-Klein modes whose masses depend on the size of the extra dimension. These KK states have no tree-level interactions with Standard Model fields but they may contribute significantly to loop processes such as neutrino oscillations or proton decay. Finally, we discuss possible experimental signatures of our scenario."}
{"text":"The purpose of this study is to examine the spatial characteristics of joint application networks (JANs) in Japanese patents, and their relationship with patent citations. JANs are defined as two or more inventors who have filed at least one patent together. The results show that JANs tend to be located near each other geographically; they also tend to cite each other's patents. These findings suggest that geographic proximity may play an important role in forming JANs. In addition, we find that JANs are likely to form around universities and research institutes. This finding suggests that knowledge spillovers between researchers working on similar topics can lead to the formation of JANs. Finally, we find that JANS formed by university-industry collaboration are less likely to cite each other than those formed solely within industry. We conclude our analysis by discussing possible explanations for these differences. Keywords: Patent citation network, Spillover effect, University"}
{"text":"We present new theoretical evolutionary tracks for the mass range 1.8 to 2.5 M\u2299, which are based on an improved treatment of convection in stellar interiors. We use these tracks as input into our seismic modelling code CESAM2k to compute synthetic seismograms for two different sets of observed frequencies (from COROT) corresponding to two possible values of the inclination angle i = 90\u00b0 or 60\u00b0 . The comparison between observations and theory shows that we can exclude one set of frequencies at high confidence level but not the other. This is due to the fact that the frequency differences between \u2113=0 and \u2113=2 modes depend strongly on the inclination angle. In addition, we find that the best fit model has a radius R=1.95R\u2299 , which agrees well with the value inferred by asteroseismology using only \u2113=0 modes. Finally, we show how this result could be used to determine the age of the star.  Keywords: Seismic modelling"}
{"text":"We study the Josephson current through an SNS junction with odd-frequency Cooper pairs, where N is a normal metal and S is a superconductor. We show that this current can be expressed as a sum over all possible Andreev bound states (ABS) at energies below the gap energy $\\Delta$. The ABS are classified into two groups according to their parity under time reversal symmetry. In particular, we find that there exists one pair of ABS which has opposite parities but equal weights. This leads to a non-vanishing Josephson current even when the phase difference across the junction equals $2\\pi$. Our results provide a microscopic understanding for recent experiments on such junctions. \n \n Introduction \n \n Superconducting proximity effect plays an important role in many physical phenomena ranging from quantum dots [1] , nanowires [2] , topological insulators [3] , and Majorana fermions [4] . Recently, it was shown theoretically [5] - [8] and experimentally [9] - [11] that the presence of odd-frequency Cooper pairs may lead to novel effects in these systems. Odd-frequency Cooper pairs have been predicted [12] and observed [13] in various materials including conventional s-wave superconductors [14] , heavy-fermion compounds [15] , and ferromagnetic metals [16] .\n \nIn this work, we consider an SNS junction consisting of a normal metal (N), a tunnel barrier (T), and a superconductor (S). As illustrated in Fig. 1(a) , the system contains both even-frequency and odd-frequency Cooper pairs [17] . Here, the even-frequency Cooper pairs are created by electrons scattering off impurities inside the normal metal while the odd-frequency Cooper pairs are generated via Andreev reflection [18] . It turns out that the latter process dominates near the interface between the normal metal and the superconductor [19] . Therefore, the odd-frequency Cooper pairs play a crucial role in determining the properties of the junction [20] . \n \n Figure 1: (Color online) (a) Schematic illustration of our model.

{"text":"We analyze the evolution and kinematics of two opposite polarity magnetic features (MPFs) in an active region using high-resolution vector magnetograms obtained by Hinode\/SOT-SP. The MPF pair is found to be associated with a coronal loop system that forms a \"U-shape\" when viewed along its axis, which we refer to as the \"U-loop\" model. We find that both MPFs are rooted at different depths below the solar surface; one MPF has a stronger field strength than the other but they have similar sizes. Both MPFs show outward motions away from their common center point during the time period studied here. In addition, there exists a counterclockwise rotation motion between these two MPFs. These results suggest that the MPF pair may evolve into a bipolar sunspot through flux cancellation processes. This work was supported by NASA grants NNX08AQ85G and NNG09FA40C."}

{"text":"Cirrus clouds are an important component in Earth's radiation budget, but their radiative properties remain poorly understood because they occur at high altitude where direct measurements are difficult to make. In this study we use data collected by the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) lidar system located on the SIRTA observatory near Paris during [2002] [2003] [2004] [2005] [2006] . The observations show that cirrus clouds can be found between 5 km and 12 km above sea level with a mean optical depth of 0.2 \u00b1 0.1. We find that mid-latitude cirrus clouds have multiple tropopause features such as double or triple tropopauses which may affect their microphysical structure. These results suggest that cirrus clouds play an important role in determining the vertical distribution of water vapor in the atmosphere. Citation: \nIntroduction\n\nCirrus clouds cover about 10%-20% of the globe's surface area [Sassen et al., 2008] , yet little is known about how these clouds form and evolve. They are particularly challenging to observe since they occur at high altitudes (5-12km), where temperatures are low enough for ice particles to exist, but too cold for liquid droplets to condense. As a result, most information about cirrus clouds comes indirectly through remote sensing techniques using instruments like lidars, radars, satellites, and aircrafts. However, each instrument has its own strengths and weaknesses depending upon the measurement technique used. For example, ground-based lidars provide accurate profiles of cloud height and extinction coefficients, while satellite retrieval algorithms suffer from poor spatial resolution and uncertainties associated with aerosol contamination."}
{"text":"We present the first results for effective-one-body (EOB) waveforms that are faithful to numerical relativity simulations over an entire inspiral, merger and ringdown phase of binary black hole systems with mass ratios q = m1\/m2 as low as 1\/10.

The resulting template bank is used to search for signals from these sources using LIGO's second observing run data. Our analysis shows that this new class of EOB waveforms can be used to detect binary black holes out to redshifts z ~ 5 at design sensitivity of Advanced LIGO\/VIRGO detectors. This represents a significant improvement compared to previous searches based on post-Newtonian approximations or phenomenological models. \nThe detection rate of binary black holes predicted by our analysis agrees well with current estimates obtained within the standard \u039bCDM cosmology model."}
{"text":"We present an analysis of the relationship between morphological distortions in galaxies, as measured by their asymmetries (A), and their projected separations into close pairs (rp). We use data drawn from the Millennium Galaxy Catalogue to examine this relation over three orders of magnitude in rp. Our results show that A increases with decreasing rp at fixed luminosity, colour or stellar mass. This trend is strongest among redder galaxies, which are also more likely to be found in close pairs than bluer ones. These trends can be explained if we assume that mergers drive both the evolution of galaxy morphology and the formation of close pairs. Using these relations together with our knowledge of how close pair fractions evolve with redshift allows us to estimate the fraction of galaxies undergoing major mergers out to z = 1.5. We find that the majority of massive galaxies have undergone one or more major mergers since z=1."}
{"text":"We present an algorithm for solving the Graph Isomorphism Problem (GIP) based on Quantum Walks and Grover's search algorithm. The proposed method is inspired by the classical algorithms that use random walks, but it uses Grover's operator instead of the Hadamard matrix in order to speed up the process. We show how this new technique can be used to solve GIP with high probability when the number of vertices in both graphs are equal or differ at most one unit. Finally we compare our results against other state-of-the-art methods. In recent years there has been growing interest in developing efficient solutions to problems related to computational complexity theory such as the Graph Isomorphism Problem(GIP). This problem consists of determining whether two given graphs are isomorphic or not; i.e., if they have the same structure regardless of their labels. \n \n Classical approaches to solve GIP usually rely on Random Walks techniques combined with some heuristics. However these methods require exponential time in the worst case scenario. On the other hand, Quantum Algorithms provide polynomial-time solutions to many NP-complete problems including GIP. These algorithms exploit the superposition principle which allows them to explore all possible states simultaneously. For example, Shor's Algorithm solves integer factorization in polynomial time while Grover's Search finds any item within a database in quadratic time."}
{"text":"In this work, we study the renormalization group equations (RGEs) for extra U(1) supersymmetric string inspired model with heavy Z' prime and its effects on gauge coupling unification at one-loop level. We find that the inclusion of new particles such as vector-like quarks and leptons can significantly affect the running behavior of gauge couplings. In particular, it is found that the presence of these new particles leads to an enhancement effect on the evolution speed of gauge couplings which may be helpful to solve the gauge hierarchy problem. Furthermore, by using the experimental data of low energy physics, we obtain some constraints on the mass spectrum of extra particles involved in our model. Finally, we also discuss briefly about the possible signatures of heavy Z'-prime boson at future colliders. The results are summarized below. \nI. INTRODUCTORY REMARK\nThe Standard Model (SM), based on SU(3) C \u00d7SU(2) L \u00d7U(1) Y gauge symmetry, has been very successful in describing all known phenomena upto TeV scale energies [1] . However, there exist several open questions related to SM like fermion masses and mixing angles [2] , neutrino oscillations [3] etc., which cannot be explained within the framework of SM. To address these issues, many extensions beyond SM have been proposed [4] - [8] .\nAmong them, Grand Unified Theory (GUTs) [9] provides a natural solution to the above mentioned problems [10] . It predicts the existence of superheavy gauge bosons called GUT-scale gauge bosons [11] whose masses lie around 10 16 GeV [12] . These GUT-scale gauge boson interactions lead to non-renormalizable operators [13] which break the SM gauge symmetries [14] . Therefore, they should not appear in any physical process [15] . This implies that their contributions must vanish when summed over all states [16] . Thus, the appearance of these nonrenormalizable operators will spoil the successes of SM [17] ."}

This article reviews the current status of research into dark energy by examining some recent observational results in this area.   The author concludes that there are still many open questions about how best to explain these observations within general relativity theory. In particular, it remains unclear whether or not the observed acceleration can be explained as being due solely to gravitational effects associated with the presence of dark energy. It also appears likely that new physics will need to be introduced if we wish to understand why the expansion of space-time should accelerate rather than decelerate over time. The universe is expanding at an accelerated rate, which has been interpreted as evidence for the existence of \"dark energy\" (DE).

{"text":"The effect of the spin-orbit (SO) interaction is studied in the framework of density functional theory for the electronic structure and molecular dynamics simulations for the lattice vibrations, using the generalized gradient approximation with SO coupling included as proposed by von Barth and Hedin.  We find that the inclusion of SO interactions leads to an increase of about 10% in the calculated value of the Debye temperature \u0398D compared to calculations without SO interactions. This result agrees well with experimental data obtained at low temperatures. In addition we calculate the phonon dispersion relations along high symmetry directions within the Brillouin zone and compare them with results obtained previously by other authors. Finally, we present our results for the specific heat Cv(T ) of bismuth up to room temperature. Our results are found to be in good agreement with experiment. It has been shown recently [1] , that the inclusion of spin orbit (SO) interactions into first principles calculations can lead to significant changes in the physical properties of solids. For example, it was demonstrated [2] that the inclusion of SO effects increases the band gap between valence and conduction bands in semiconductors such as Si or Ge. Also, it was shown [3] that the inclusion of SO corrections improves significantly the description of the structural phase transition in NiTi alloys. Furthermore, it was reported [4] that the inclusion of SO terms leads to a reduction of the magnetic moment per atom in FePt compounds which is also observed experimentally [5] ."}

In addition we show how the network evolves over time by analyzing its growth rate and degree distribution. Finally, we study the relationship between the number of transactions executed at each node and their respective degrees. Our results suggest that nodes with higher degrees tend to trade more than lower-degree nodes.

{"text":"We study the statistical properties of simulated dark matter halos in cosmological N-body simulations, focusing on their shapes and orientations with respect to each other. We find that these quantities are strongly correlated for pairs of halos separated by less than one virial radius (the region within which the density is roughly constant). This correlation persists even when we consider only those pairs whose mutual separation lies along the line-of-sight between them. The correlations can be understood as arising due to tidal forces exerted by neighboring halos. In particular, we show that the distribution of halo shapes depends sensitively upon whether or not they lie close to an axis of symmetry of the local gravitational potential field. Finally, we compare our results against observations of galaxy clusters obtained using weak lensing techniques. Our analysis suggests that the observed cluster morphologies may provide useful constraints on the nature of primordial fluctuations responsible for structure formation in the universe."}

These decays proceed through loop diagrams involving virtual particles such as charm quarks which can be calculated using perturbation theory [2] , while non-perturbative effects enter via matrix elements of four-quark operators [3] .\nIn this Letter we report new measurements of the branching fractions for the decays B + \u2192 K * 0 P + , B + \u2192 K * + P0 , B + \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b7\u2032 and B + \u2192 K + K \u2212 \u03c0 + [4] .

{"text":"The EPR paradox is one of the most important problems in quantum mechanics. It was formulated by Einstein et al., who claimed that it could be solved only if there existed hidden variables which were not included in the standard formulation of quantum mechanics. The original EPR argument has been criticized on several grounds including its reliance upon an unjustified assumption about locality. In this work we reexamine the EPR experiment using modern techniques for measuring correlations between photons produced via parametric down-conversion (PDC). We show how to measure all relevant quantities needed to test Bell's theorem with PDC sources. Our results are consistent with those predicted by quantum mechanics but do not violate any known bounds on nonlocality. This suggests that the original EPR argument may have been flawed or incomplete. Quantum entanglement plays a central role in many areas of physics ranging from condensed matter systems to high energy particle collisions. However, despite decades of research into the foundations of quantum mechanics, the exact nature of quantum entanglement remains elusive. One of the main reasons behind this difficulty lies in the fact that quantum states cannot generally be cloned [1] . As such, it is impossible to perform experiments where two copies of a given state can be prepared independently so as to compare their properties directly [2] .\nIn 1964, John Bell showed that certain types of measurements performed on pairs of particles would lead to violations of classical inequalities [3] , thereby demonstrating that quantum mechanical predictions cannot always be reproduced within a classical framework [4] . Since then, numerous experimental tests of these so-called Bell inequalities have been carried out [5] - [8] . Most notably, in 1992, Aspect et al. reported the first violation of Bell's inequality [9] , thus confirming the existence of quantum entanglement experimentally [10] ."}

{"text":"We use hydrodynamic simulations to study how proto-clusters grow and evolve into galaxy clusters, focusing on their baryon content at high redshifts (z > 5).

This effect is more pronounced for higher mass halos which have larger gas fractions than less massive ones. Using this result we derive constraints on the abundance of high-redshift proto-clusters as a function of halo mass. These results can be used to test models of structure formation and reionization.

{"text":"We present the first measurement of the gamma-ray emission associated with the hot gas in galaxy clusters using data collected by Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT). We find that the observed gamma-ray luminosity is consistent with theoretical predictions based on the assumption that the energy density of relativistic particles follows closely that of thermal plasma, as expected for hadronic models where cosmic rays are accelerated at shocks driven into intracluster medium by mergers or AGN activity. The inferred cosmic ray pressure is found to be comparable to the thermal pressure within r500 but decreases more rapidly outside this radius. This result suggests that cosmic rays may play an important role in regulating cluster dynamics over large scales. In addition, we use our results together with those obtained previously by Suzaku X-ray observatory to constrain the fraction of nonthermal pressure support in galaxy clusters. Our analysis indicates that the contribution of cosmic rays to total pressure can reach up to 30%-40% inside r500 while it drops below 10% beyond 2r500.

One promising technique involves measuring the radio-frequency (RF) emission produced when UHE particles interact with molecules in the upper atmosphere [2] , which can be detected remotely over large areas [3] .\n \nThe most prominent feature of this RF emission is an intense broadband pulse lasting several microseconds [4] . This pulse arises because the charged particle cascade generated by each primary cosmic ray interacts strongly with the geomagnetic field, causing it to emit coherently across a wide range of frequencies [5] . However, other mechanisms may contribute significantly to the total RF emission [6] . \n \n Here we present observations made with the Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR), one component of the International LOFAR Telescope [7] . Our analysis focuses primarily on measurements taken between 2004 and 2006 with the Long Wavelength Array (LWA) [8] , a phased array consisting of 144 dual-polarized dipole antennas operating at wavelengths ranging from 10 m to 80 m [9] .

{"text":"The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is expected to produce many new particles, including those that are predicted by extensions of the Standard Model such as Supersymmetry and Extra Dimensions. One of these exotic particles could be the elusive Higgs boson which would explain why elementary particles have mass. The LHC also produces cosmic rays, some of which interact with Earth's atmosphere producing high-energy muons. These muons decay into electrons or taus, which then decay further into photons called \"muon decays\". Muon decays can occur inside the ATLAS experiment at CERN, Switzerland. This thesis describes how we used data collected between 2010 and 2012 to search for evidence of neutrino oscillations using this signature. Neutrinos are neutral leptons produced when cosmic rays collide with air molecules in Earth's atmosphere. They travel through space unimpeded until they reach Earth where their interactions may change depending on whether they are electron anti-neutrinos, muon neutrinos, tau neutrinos etc.. If neutrinos oscillate during propagation, it means there must exist another particle - the so-called \"sixth family lepton\": an electrically charged partner to each type of neutrino.

We show that there is an obstruction to gauge all global symmetries at once; this obstruction can be understood as arising from anomalies associated with certain topological defects which are present even when the theory has no explicit massless particles charged under any global symmetry group. In particular we find that for N = 1 superconformal theories in two-dimensions, only those global symmetries whose currents have integer spin may be consistently gauged. This result generalizes previous results obtained by Witten using anomaly inflow arguments. Finally, we discuss how our analysis applies to string compactifications down to two dimensions. Gauge fields play a crucial role in particle physics, but it turns out that not every global symmetry of a quantum field theory (QFT) can be made local without breaking some other important properties such as unitarity or conformal invariance. The purpose of this talk will be to explain why this happens, and what consequences it has for QFTs in 2+1 dimensions."}
{"text":"We study the evolution of age structure and life history traits by using an age-structured population model with stochastic demographic events, where individuals can reproduce at any age. We show that selection against demographic stochasticity leads to increased reproductive effort early in life (i.e., earlier reproduction) and decreased mortality rates later in life. This is because higher reproductive efforts increase offspring numbers but also lead to more deaths due to competition for resources among siblings. In contrast, lower mortality rates decrease sibling competition and thus reduce the number of deaths caused by this source of demographic stochasticity. Our results are robust across different levels of environmental stochasticity and initial conditions. The evolutionary consequences of demographic stochasticity have been studied extensively in recent years [1\u20133] . However, most studies on this topic focus on populations without age structure or assume that all individuals reproduce at the same age [4\u20136] , which may not be realistic [7\u20139] .\nHere we use an age-structured model with stochastic demographic events [10, 11] to investigate how selection acts on life-history traits when there is variation in individual ages at first reproduction [12] . Specifically, we consider a scenario where individuals can reproduce at various ages and compete for limited resources within their family groups [13] . We find that selection against demographic stochasticities increases reproductive effort early in life and decreases mortality rates late in life. These findings are consistent with previous theoretical work showing that selection favors reduced variance in offspring number [14\u201318] ."}
{"text":"We consider the gravitational effect on the Casimir force between two parallel plates in an accelerating frame, and show that it is possible to obtain a repulsive force at short distances even if the initial state has no net charge or current density. We also discuss how this result can be obtained by using the concept of local energy-momentum tensor for electromagnetic fields. The possibility of obtaining such a repulsive force was first suggested by Yukawa in 1951 as a way to explain nuclear forces without introducing new particles. \n \n In recent years there have been several attempts to measure experimentally the Casimir force (see e.g., Refs. [1]-[6]). However, all these experiments are performed with macroscopic objects which do not allow one to test directly the predictions of QED concerning the behavior of the vacuum fluctuations near boundaries [7, 8] . \n \n On the other hand, the measurement of the Casimir force between microscopic bodies would provide information about the properties of the vacuum [9] , and could lead to tests of QED [10] - [12] . \n \n It should be noted that the experimental determination of the Casimir force requires very accurate measurements because its magnitude is extremely small compared to gravity [13] . For example, the most precise experiment so far [6] gives only a relative accuracy of 0.1%. This means that any systematic error will dominate over statistical errors. Therefore, it is important to understand theoretically the dependence of the Casimir force upon external parameters like temperature [14] , pressure [15] , and velocity [16] ."}
{"text":"The theory of supercoupling is developed to explain the confinement of electromagnetic waves inside narrow channels or tight bends using epsilon-near-zero metamaterials (ENZMs). The ENZM can be realized by embedding metallic wires into dielectric materials with low permittivity values at microwave frequencies. A theoretical model based on the transmission line method is used for analyzing the field distribution along the channel. It shows that the electric fields are confined within the ENZM layer when it is placed between two conventional dielectrics. This phenomenon leads to an increase in the effective refractive index of the structure which results in wave guiding through the channel. In addition, the effect of squeezing the energy density is investigated numerically. Finally, the proposed design concept is verified experimentally by fabricating a prototype of a supercoupled channel made up of three layers of different materials: air as top cladding, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) as middle core, and copper wire mesh as bottom ground plane."}
{"text":"The brain is an organ that has evolved to be dynamic and plastic, constantly changing its structure in response to internal and external stimuli.  The human brain can change throughout life by forming new connections between neurons or eliminating existing ones.   This ability allows humans to adapt to their environment and learn continuously.   However, this flexibility also makes it vulnerable to damage caused by disease, trauma, aging, etc., which may lead to neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, Huntington's Disease, Epilepsy, Traumatic Brain Injury, Multiple Sclerosis, etc.   In recent years there have been significant advances in neuroscience research aimed at understanding how the brain works and developing treatments for these diseases.   One approach involves using neural prosthetic devices to replace damaged parts of the brain with artificial components that are capable of performing similar functions.   Neural prosthetics are electronic systems designed to interface directly with the nervous system to restore lost function due to injury or disease.   These devices include microelectrodes implanted into the brain tissue to record electrical activity; stimulating electrodes placed on or near nerves to deliver electrical stimulation; and wireless communication links used to transmit data recorded by the recording electrodes and\/or control signals generated by the stimulating electrodes back to a computer located outside the body.   ..."}
{"text":"We present new observations and analysis of the Balmer-dominated shocks driven by supernova remnants (SNRs) into dense molecular clouds, which are known as \"molecular cloud shocks\" or \"Balmer-dominated shocks\". We find that these shocks have an intermediate temperature between those of typical J-type and C-type shocks. The observed emission lines show prominent P-Cygni profiles with blueshifted absorption features indicating high velocities up to 100 km s-1 . These results suggest that the transition zone is located at the interface between the shocked gas and unshocked ambient medium. In addition, we found that the widths of the H\u03b1 line profiles increase toward the center of SNR W28. This indicates that the density structure of the surrounding environment may be more complicated than previously thought. Our study suggests that Balmer-dominated molecular cloud shocks can provide important information on the physical conditions of the interstellar medium around young SNRs."}
{"text":"We present Block Locally Optimal Precondioner for the solution of large sparse linear systems arising from discretized partial differential equations using Krylov subspace methods.  The preconditioners are constructed by solving local eigenvalue problems on small subdomains, which can be done efficiently with parallel iterative solvers such as GMRES or BiCGSTAB. We show that these preconditioners have good convergence properties when used within an inexact Newton-Krylov-Schwarz method to solve nonlinear PDEs. In addition we demonstrate how this approach is implemented in two popular libraries, PETSc and hypre. Finally, we provide numerical results showing the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm. Keywords: Nonlinear PDE, Inexact Newton Method, Parallel Iterative Solver, Preconditioning, Subdomain Decomposition. 1 Introduction.\nThe goal of this work is to develop efficient algorithms for solving large-scale nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). These algorithms will use domain decomposition techniques combined with parallel iterative solving strategies to construct effective preconditioners for the resulting linear system. Our focus here is on developing new approaches for constructing locally optimal block diagonal preconditioners based on the Schur complements associated with overlapping Schwarz methods. This type of preconditioner has been shown to perform well for many types of applications including convection-diffusion-reaction equations [19, 20] , Stokes flow [3, 4] , Maxwell's equations [6] , elasticity [7, 8] , and incompressible Navier-Stokes flows [9, 10] . However, there remain several challenges related to their construction and application. First, it is difficult to compute accurate approximations to the Schur complement matrices due to the presence of singularities at corners and edges of the computational domains. Second, the number of unknowns per subdomain increases rapidly as the problem size grows making direct factorization impractical. Third, the condition numbers of the Schur complement matrices grow exponentially fast with respect to the number of subdomains. Fourth, the cost of applying the preconditioner may become prohibitively expensive if one"}
{"text":"We present an algorithm for computing non-abelian gauge theories in two different ways, which we call \"directly\" and \"indirectly\". The directly computed quantities are related to those obtained by standard Monte Carlo techniques via Feynman rules. In contrast, indirectly computed quantities can be evaluated without any reference to Feynman diagrams or perturbation theory at all. We demonstrate that both computations agree with each other within statistical errors over several orders of magnitude in lattice spacing and volume. This provides strong evidence that our approach is correct. Finally, we show how this method allows us to compute observables such as glueball masses and decay constants accurately even when they cannot be extracted using conventional methods. Introduction: Gauge theories play a central role in particle physics. However, it has been notoriously difficult to study them numerically because of their nonperturbative nature. Here we propose a new numerical technique based on dual formulations of quantum field theories (QFTs) [1] . Duality transformations relate QFTs formulated in terms of fields living on spacetime points to equivalent ones defined in terms of fields living only on links between these points [2] .\nIn particular, we consider SU(Nc) Yang-Mills theories coupled to fermions transforming according to some representation R of SU(Nc). These theories have a number of interesting physical applications ranging from nuclear physics [3] , where Nc= 3, to high-energy phenomenology [4] , where Nc> 4. For example, one may use this formalism to calculate hadronic matrix elements relevant for precision measurements of Standard Model parameters [5] ."}

Finally, comparisons between our results and those reported previously show that the proposed schemes outperform their counterparts. Keywords: Chaos-based cryptography, Secure communications, Third-order chaotic map, Inverse functions. 1 Introduction With the rapid development of information technology, there has been an increasing demand for more efficient and reliable data transmission over insecure channels. To meet this requirement, many researchers have devoted themselves to developing novel techniques for constructing secure communication systems [1] . Among them, chaos-based cryptographic algorithms attract much attention due to their advantages including high security, low cost and simple implementation [2] .\nChaos-based encryption methods can be classified into two categories according to whether they use chaotic sequences or not [3] . One category includes stream ciphers [4] , block ciphers [5] , hash functions [6] and digital signature [7] which do not employ chaotic sequences directly but utilize other properties of chaos like ergodicity [8] , sensitivity [9] and pseudo-randomness [10] . Another category consists of direct sequence spread spectrum [11] , frequency hopping [12] , time-hopping [13] and optical chaos [14] which exploit chaotic signals directly [15] ."}
{"text":"Affinity propagation (AP) is an algorithm for clustering that has been shown to be effective in many applications, including bioinformatics and computer vision. However, AP requires the number of clusters as input parameter which may not always be known beforehand. In this work we propose a novel approach based on constrained optimization techniques to automatically determine the optimal number of clusters using only pairwise similarity information between samples. We show how our method can be applied to several problems related to gene expression analysis such as finding co-expressed genes or identifying differentially expressed genes across multiple conditions. Our results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches both in terms of accuracy and robustness. The source code used to generate all experiments presented here will be made available at http:\/\/bitbucket.org\/juanlorenzo\/softconstraint-clustering\/wiki\/Home . Affinity Propagation (AP) is an efficient message-passing algorithm for clustering that has recently gained popularity due to its effectiveness in various fields ranging from image processing [1] , computational biology [2] , and recommender systems [3] .\nHowever, one disadvantage of AP is that it requires the user to specify the desired number of clusters k before running the algorithm. This requirement makes AP less suitable when there are no prior knowledge about the number of clusters present in the dataset [4] . To overcome this problem, some authors have suggested heuristics to estimate the value of k [5] while others have developed methods to find the best possible partition given any fixed k [6] . Nevertheless, these solutions still require the user to provide additional parameters like the maximum allowed cluster size [7] or the minimum required density [8] making them difficult to use without expert knowledge [9] .\nIn order to address this issue, we introduce Soft-Constrained Affinity Propagation (SCAP), a new approach for determining the optimal number of clusters in datasets with unknown structure. SCAP uses Constrained Optimization Techniques [10] to solve the NP-hard combinatorial problem of finding the optimal solution within a set of feasible solutions [11] . More specifically,..."}

A point x # X is called a strong peak point if there exists an f # S(X) such that |f (x)| = sup{|f (y)| : y # X}. We prove that every separable reflexive Banach space has a dense set of strong peak points. As applications we show that every separable reflexivizable Banach space contains a copy of c 0 , and that every separable superreflexive Banach space contains a subspace isomorphic to l p for some 1 < p < + . In this note we study the properties of strong peaks points in Banach spaces. The concept was introduced by J. Lindenstrauss [L] who proved that every separable reflexible Banach space has a nonempty set of strong peak points; see also [JL1] .\nIn Section 2 we give several equivalent characterizations of strong peak points. In particular, it turns out that a point x # X is a strong peak point if and only if there exist two sequences (a n ) and (b n ) in R satisfying lim n \u00c4 a n = lim n \u00c4 b n = 1 and lim n \u00c4 a n &1\u00c22 b n = 0 such that the sequence (a n b n ) converges weakly to zero but not strongly.

{"text":"We present new methods to determine the mass-loss rate in evolved stars (AGB) using radio observations at centimeter wavelengths, and compare these results with those obtained by infrared dust emission measurements. We use archival VLA data of three nearby carbon-rich AGB stars, IK Tau, IRC+10216, and AFGL 3068, which are known to have high mass-loss rates. The observed flux densities were compared with predictions made by spherically symmetric radiative transfer models that include both free-free and thermal dust emission components. For each star we find good agreement between our model predictions and the observed flux density values when assuming an appropriate value for the mass-loss rate. Our results show that the mass-loss rates derived from radio continuum observations can be used as reliable estimates of the total mass lost during the late stages of stellar evolution.  These results also demonstrate how radio observations can provide important constraints on theoretical models of circumstellar envelopes around evolved stars."}

The data were obtained with the adaptive optics system NAOS-CONICA on the VLT telescope and cover an area of 0.5 arcmin2 around the central star HD 37022. We detect more than 100 point sources down to Ks = 18 mag within this field-of-view. Using these data we have constructed colour-magnitude diagrams for different areas inside our field-of-view. From these CMDs we find that there are two populations of stars which can be separated by their position in the diagrams: one population is redder and fainter while another has bluer colours and brighter magnitudes. These results suggest that the first group consists mainly of low mass pre-main sequence stars surrounded by circumstellar disks, whereas the second group contains mostly high mass main-sequence stars without any surrounding material."}
{"text":"We study the mass spectrum of diquark-antidiquark bound states, as well as that of meson-like excitations, in the CFL phase of QCD at high density using an effective field theory approach.

The lightest state is identified to be the scalar diquark while the heaviest one corresponds to the axial vector diquark. In addition we also obtain the masses for various mesonic excitations which can be classified into three categories according to their transformation properties under flavor SU(3) group.

INTRODUCTION Dense nuclear matter may exist inside neutron stars (NSs). It has been suggested by many authors [1] that such matter could undergo a transition to a new state where quarks become deconfined but still confined within some finite volume due to strong interactions between them [2] , i.e., quark matter [3] . This state was first proposed by Bodmer [4] and Witten [5] independently about thirty years ago. Since then it has attracted much attention both theoretically [6] - [8] and experimentally [9] .\nThe most interesting feature of this state is its superfluidity [10] . If the temperature T of the system drops below the critical value Tc = 0.2 GeV [11] , quarks will condense into Cooper pairs [12] and form a condensate [13] . As a result, the ground state becomes macroscopically coherent [14] and behaves like a superfluid [15] . Such a state is called Color Flavor Locking (CFL) [16] because all quarks have the same Fermi momentum kF [17] and thus share the same gap parameter \u2206 [18] . Due to the pairing effect [19] , quarks acquire different electric charges [20] : 1\/3 for up\/down quarks [21] and 2\/3 for strange quar"}
{"text":"We report on the observation of super-Poissonian shot noise in closed quantum dots (QDs). We show that this effect is due to dephasing and can be used for its characterization. The QD emission linewidth was measured by scanning Fabry-Perot interferometry, while the photon statistics were studied using Hanbury Brown-Twiss experiments with two avalanche photodiodes operating at 1 GHz bandwidth. In order to study the influence of temperature we performed these measurements between 4 K and 300 K. At low temperatures, below 50 K, the QD emission linewidth decreases exponentially with decreasing temperature following an activation energy of about 0.3 meV. Above 100 K it follows a power law dependence with T-1\/2. Super-Poissonian shot-noise appears above 60 K and increases rapidly up to room temperature where it reaches values more than twice those expected for Poissonian light."}
{"text":"We present results on collisions between two identical spherical grains with radii ranging from 0.1 to 1 mm and velocities up to 10 m\/s, which are relevant for the growth of planetesimals in protoplanetary disks. We find that the collision outcome depends strongly on the impact velocity. At low velocities (<5 m\/s), the colliding particles stick together after the first contact without any fragmentation or erosion. For higher velocities we observe bouncing, sticking, partial fragmentation, and complete fragmentation depending on the impact angle. The transition between different outcomes is smooth but can be described by simple scaling laws. In particular, we show that the critical velocity at which the transition from sticking to bouncing occurs scales as vcrit \u221d R0.6 where R is the radius of one particle. This dependence agrees well with recent experiments performed under microgravity conditions.

{"text":"We present an analysis of gravitational wave signals produced by rotating stellar cores collapsing to black holes, using numerical relativity simulations performed with the Einstein Toolkit. We find that generic collapse models produce characteristic features in their gravitational waveforms which can be used as templates for matched filtering searches. These include (i) a precursor signal, (ii) a ringdown phase and (iii) a post-merger phase. The precursor is associated with the formation of a shock front at the surface of the core; it has been observed previously but its properties have not yet been studied systematically. In this work we show how these properties depend on the rotation rate of the progenitor star. For rapidly-rotating progenitors, the precursor signal contains multiple peaks whose frequencies are determined primarily by the spin frequency of the central object prior to merger. This suggests that such precursors could be detected even if they were emitted by binary neutron stars or black hole-neutron star systems where no information about the pre-merger spins would be available."}
{"text":"We present the Nobeyama CO (J=1-0) atlas for nearby spiral galaxies, which is based on our previous work by Kuno et al. (1995) . The sample consists of 45 barred and nonbarred spirals with distances less than 30 Mpc. We have observed these galaxies at an angular resolution of about 3 arcsec using the NRO 45 m telescope. In this study we use only those data points that are detected above 5 sigma level to make maps of molecular gas distribution. These maps show clearly that there exists a difference between barred and unbarred spirals: while most of the barred spirals exhibit strong concentration of molecular gas along their bars, such concentrations do not appear in many cases of unbarred spirals. This result suggests that the presence or absence of a bar may be one of the important factors determining the structure of galactic disks. It also indicates that the formation mechanism of bars should be different from that of bulges. \n \n\nThe authors acknowledge support from Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (No. 08540349), Ministry of Education, Science and Culture, Japan."}

The results obtained here extend previous ones given in the literature to more general cases where the driving noise is not necessarily Gaussian or has non-Gaussian components. In particular, we provide new proofs for the existing results when the driving noise is purely Gaussian.

{"text":"The authors present an overview of the current state-of-the-art in understanding how lipids form membranes and what determines their physical properties.  They then introduce a new theoretical framework for describing these phenomena, which they call the concise theory of chiral lipid membranes (CTCLM).  The CTCLM is based on three key concepts:  1) Lipid bilayers are composed of two interdigitated monolayers; 2) Each monolayer contains both enantiomeric forms of each lipid species; 3) Enantiomers have different molecular shapes that lead to differences in packing density within the membrane.  This model explains many experimental observations about the structure and dynamics of biological membranes without introducing any additional parameters or assumptions beyond those already used by existing models. It also provides a simple explanation for why certain types of lipids tend to be found at specific locations within cell membranes.

We find that the temperature profile is well described by a broken power law with an inner slope of 1.5-2, which steepens to 3 at r = 50 kpc. The density profile shows a flat core within 10 kpc followed by a steeper decline beyond this radius. These profiles are consistent with those expected for gas sloshing driven by minor mergers. In addition we detect significant azimuthal variations in both temperature and metallicity around the center of the cluster. This suggests that the metal-rich cool core has been disrupted by recent merger activity. Finally, we report the detection of diffuse radio emission associated with the ICM out to large radii (100-200 kpc). The spectral index of the radio emission decreases towards larger radii indicating that it may be due to synchrotron radiation produced by relativistic electrons accelerated by shocks generated during the merging process."}
{"text":"We present the results on the unique type Ib supernova (SN) 2005bf in NGC 6946, which is one of only two SNe with an unambiguous association to a gamma-ray burst (GRB). The light curve and spectral evolution are compared with those of other GRB-associated SNe as well as normal SNe Ia and IIb. We find that SN 2005bf shows several unusual features among these objects. In particular, it has a very slow decline rate during its nebular phase, indicating that the ejecta mass may be much larger than expected for ordinary core-collapse SNe. This suggests that the progenitor star was massive enough to form a black hole directly without going through a neutron-star stage. If this is true, we expect that the central engine of the associated GRB would have been powered by accretion onto such a black hole rather than by radioactive decay energy. Our analysis also indicates that the explosion site should be located close to the center of the host galaxy, suggesting that the progenitor system might have experienced significant natal kick before the explosion. \n \n Keywords: Gamma-ray bursts"}
{"text":"We study the effect of Coulomb gauge fixing on the gluon propagator in Landau gauge, using lattice simulations with two different actions for SU(2) Yang-Mills theory. We find that the inclusion of Gribov copies leads to an increase in the infrared strength of the gluon propagator; this is consistent with earlier results obtained by other groups. \n \n In addition we show how the presence of Gribov copies affects the static quark-antiquark potential at large distances. The latter quantity can be extracted from the correlation function of Polyakov loops which are defined as closed lines winding around the periodic spatial directions of the lattice. This allows us to compare our results directly with those obtained previously within perturbation theory. Our findings suggest that the perturbative approach breaks down when one considers the full non-perturbative effects associated with Gribov copies. Finally, we discuss possible implications of these results for phenomenological studies of QCD."}
{"text":"We report on new observations with Suzaku and XMM-Newton that reveal an extended component in the hard X-ray spectrum (10-40 keV) of the Coma galaxy cluster, which is located at a distance of about 100 Mpc.

{"text":"We propose an approach to the problem of predicting football match results based on self-confirming beliefs and their evolution over time. We use data from the English Premier League (EPL) season 2013-14, which consists of 380 matches played by 20 teams in 38 rounds. The proposed method is tested against two baseline models that do not take into account any temporal dynamics between consecutive games. Our experiments show that our model outperforms both baselines with respect to accuracy and F1 score metrics. In addition, we demonstrate how the proposed model can be used as part of a decision support system for betting purposes. Predicting sports outcomes has been one of the most popular research topics among researchers working in machine learning and data mining communities. This interest stems mainly from its practical applications such as sport betting systems or recommendation engines for fans. However, despite the large number of studies conducted so far, there are still many open problems related to this topic. One of these challenges concerns the prediction of future events given past observations. For example, if we want to predict whether team A will win game X vs. team B at home ground C, then it may seem reasonable to assume that the outcome of previous games involving either team A or team B should have some influence on the final result."}
{"text":"We present results for photoionised gas in an expanding spherical shell, irradiated by multiple point-like and extended sources with different luminosities and spatial distributions. We find that the presence of additional sources can significantly affect the thermal state of the gas at large distances (several times larger than the Str\u00f6mgren radius) from the central source(s). The effect is more pronounced when the number density of the surrounding medium decreases rapidly towards the outer boundary of the cloud. In this case, the contribution to heating due to external radiation becomes comparable or even exceeds the internal energy input from the central source(es), resulting in higher temperatures throughout most of the volume occupied by the shell. This may have important implications for the interpretation of observations of extragalactic HII regions. We also show how the inclusion of dust grains affects our results. Finally we discuss possible applications of these findings to other astrophysical problems such as the formation of planetary nebulae. \n \n Keywords: Photoionization"}
{"text":"We present results on polarized radio emission in the field surrounding the galaxy cluster Abell 2218, observed with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) at 1.4 GHz and 4.8 GHz.

The majority have fractional linear polarization between 10% and 20%, while two objects show higher values up to 40%. All detected sources appear to be associated with galaxies within the central region of Abell 2218. In addition we find evidence for diffuse polarized emission around the brightest member of this galaxy cluster. This is likely due to synchrotron radiation produced by relativistic electrons accelerated in shocks driven into the intracluster medium during multiple mergers that occurred over time scales ranging from 10 Myr to several Gyrs ago. Our data also reveal an extended halo-like structure which surrounds the entire galaxy cluster."}
{"text":"We study particle motion in rapidly oscillating potentials with arbitrary initial phases and show that, for certain values of this phase, particles can be trapped by the potential even if it is not periodic.  We find exact solutions to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation describing such systems using Floquet theory and discuss their physical implications. In particular we consider an optical lattice formed by counter-propagating laser beams whose frequencies are detuned slightly from each other. This system has been studied extensively both theoretically and experimentally but our results provide new insights into its dynamics. Introduction:-In recent years there have been many studies on the physics of ultracold atoms confined in optical lattices [1] . These experiments typically involve trapping cold neutral atoms in a standing wave pattern created by two counterpropagating laser fields which are tuned close together so as to form a deep periodic potential [2] .\nThe resulting atomic gas forms a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) [3] , where all the atoms occupy the same quantum state [4] . Such systems have attracted considerable interest because they allow one to explore fundamental questions about quantum mechanics [5] - [8] while also providing a platform for studying novel phenomena [9] - [11] . For example, these systems have recently been used to demonstrate superfluidity [12] , Josephson effects [13] , Bloch oscillations [14] , Landau-Zener tunneling [15] , and Anderson localization [16] . However, despite much theoretical work [17] - [20] , the full range of possible behaviors exhibited by these systems remains poorly understood [21] .\nOne reason why the behavior of these systems is difficult to predict is that the underlying potential is time-dependent [22] . Indeed, since the lasers forming the lattice are usually far off-resonant [23] , the amplitude of the potential varies periodically over timescales comparable to those associated with typical experimental parameters [24] . As a result, the energy spectrum of the system becomes quasi-periodic [25] and the usual methods of solving the Schr\u00f6dinger equation break down [26] ."}
{"text":"The measurement is performed using the data collected by the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment during Run 2, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb$^{-1}$ . The analysis uses events with one photon and two jets where both photons are reconstructed within the barrel calorimeter acceptance, |\u03b7| < 1.44. Events are selected requiring that each jet has transverse momentum pT > 30 GeV and pseudorapidity |\u03b7| < 4.7. A multivariate discriminant based on boosted decision trees is used for signal selection. The measured cross section as a function of the leading jet pT is compared to theoretical predictions obtained at next-to-leading order accuracy including resummation of soft gluons up to next-to-next-to-leading-logarithmic accuracy. Good agreement between theory and measurements is observed over most of the kinematic range probed. \n \n Keywords: direct photon, dijet"}
{"text":"The electronic structure and magnetic properties of heme are investigated by density functional theory (DFT) with the Hubbard U correction for strong electron correlation effects, which is essential to reproduce the correct ground state spin multiplicity in this system. The calculated results show that the ferromagnetic coupling between iron ions leads to an antiferromagnetically ordered ground state when the axial ligands are included. In addition, we find that the inclusion of the solvent effect on the geometry optimization does not change the energy difference significantly but it can affect the relative stability among different spin states. Finally, our calculations suggest that the high-spin state may be more stable than previously thought based on experimental measurements. This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 11404160. We thank Prof. Yi-Kai Wu at Peking University for helpful discussions. \n \n Introduction \n \n Heme is one of the most important cofactors found in many proteins involved in biological processes such as oxygen transport, storage, sensing, and catalysis1-5. It consists of a porphyrin ring coordinated to Fe(II), where four nitrogen atoms form two pyrrole rings connected through methine bridges6-8. Due to its importance in biology, there have been numerous theoretical studies investigating the structural9-12, optical13-15, vibrational16-19, and magnetic20-24 properties of heme. However, despite these efforts, some fundamental questions remain unanswered regarding the electronic structure and magnetic behavior of heme25-27. For example, although the ground state spin multiplicity has been determined experimentally28-30, the exact nature of the excited spin states remains unclear31-33. Moreover, the origin of the observed ferromagnetic coupling between iron centers34-36 still needs further investigation37-39."}
{"text":"We present the results of long-term numerical simulations of binary black hole (BBH) evolution, including gravitational radiation reaction and general relativistic effects such as frame dragging and tidal disruption. We focus on binaries with total mass M = 100-1000M\u2299 that evolve through collisional nuclear environments at high redshifts z > 10. Our main goal is to study how BBHs can grow by accretion during their early stages of evolution when they are surrounded by dense gas clouds. In particular we investigate whether these systems can reach masses above 1000M\u2299 before merging within a Hubble time. The initial conditions for our models were obtained using Monte Carlo sampling of the distribution function of isolated BBHs constructed by Belczynski et al. (2010) . For each model we performed several runs starting from different orbital configurations. All calculations were carried out assuming circular orbits. We find that most of the massive binaries merge within a few hundred million years after formation due to emission of gravitational waves. However, some of them survive until today if they form in regions where the density of surrounding gas exceeds $10^{9}$ cm$^{-3}$. These binaries may be detectable by future space-based gravitational wave observatories like LISA or DECIGO\/BBO."}
{"text":"We study the ground state properties of spin-1\/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on square (SQ) and triangular lattices (TL). We show that for both SQ and TL, there is no Neel ordering at any finite temperature T . The absence of Neel ordering can be understood by studying the behavior of spin-spin correlation function S(0)*S(r) . For SQ we find that it decays exponentially with distance r , while for TL it shows power law decaying behaviour. This indicates that the system has short range correlations which are consistent with the Mermin-Wagner theorem. However, our results also suggest that the system may have some kind of magnetic ordering below certain critical temperatures Tc .\nThe values of Tc obtained numerically agree well with those predicted theoretically using mean field theory.

{"text":"We study the SLE (Schramm-Loewner Evolution) process for the scaling limit of interfaces between different phases in the two-dimensional Ising model with nearest-neighbor interactions on an arbitrary planar graph, and its generalization to higher dimensions. We show that the interface is described by a chordal Schramm-L\u00f6wner evolution if the underlying lattice has no loops or multiple edges; otherwise it is described by a radial Schramm-L\u00f6wner evolutions. The results are obtained using conformal field theory techniques. In particular we use the fact that the partition function of these models can be written as a correlation function of primary fields in some rational conformal field theories. This allows us to obtain explicit formulas for the probability distribution functions of various geometric quantities associated with the interfaces such as their winding numbers around vertices etc.. \nIntroduction\n\nThe Schramm-Loewner Evolutions (SLE)\nprocesses were introduced by Schramm [Sch00] , who showed that they provide a natural description of the scaling limits of interfaces in statistical mechanics systems at criticality. These processes have been studied extensively since then both theoretically and numerically.

{"text":"We report on the observation of thermalization in an ultracold mixture of fermionic lithium-7 ($^7$Li) atoms with bosonic rubidium-87 ($^{87}$Rb). The system is prepared by evaporating both species simultaneously into a crossed optical dipole trap, followed by forced radio-frequency evaporation to reach quantum degeneracy at temperatures below $T_c\\sim100\\:\\mathrm{nK}$ for each species separately. We then study the relaxation dynamics after suddenly changing the trapping potential depth while keeping the temperature constant. This leads to a sudden change in the density distribution which triggers collisional processes that redistribute energy between different modes. By measuring the time evolution of the cloud size we find that the two species thermalize within less than one second. Our results are consistent with theoretical predictions based on kinetic theory. In particular, they show that the observed thermalization rate agrees well with the expected value for elastic collisions only."}
{"text":"We study the orbital evolution in galactic nuclei with supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and show that SMBH motion can lead to strong resonant interactions between stars, which may be responsible for some observed phenomena such as nuclear star clusters or tidal disruption events.  We use N-body simulations to demonstrate how the presence of an eccentric SMBH orbit leads to the formation of multiple families of stable orbits around it. The number of these families depends on the mass ratio between the SMBH and its host galaxy's bulge. For small mass ratios we find only one family of stable orbits; however, when this ratio is increased by several orders of magnitude, additional families appear. These new families are characterized by their high eccentricities and inclinations relative to the equatorial plane of the system. In addition, they have very different periods compared to those found previously in studies where the SMBH was assumed to move along circular orbits. Finally, we discuss possible observational signatures associated with each family of orbits."}

{"text":"We present an experimental investigation into complementarity between position and momentum measurements on single photons using a modified version of the original Einstein-Bohr photon box experiment.  The results show that, for this particular measurement scheme, there is no violation of Bell's inequality or any other form of nonlocality. We also demonstrate how our setup can be used to investigate quantum contextuality by performing two different experiments with identical settings but opposite outcomes. In one case we observe violations of Bell inequalities while in the other they are not violated. This shows that the observed behavior cannot be explained within classical physics and demonstrates quantum contextuality. Quantum mechanics predicts that certain physical quantities such as position and momentum do not have simultaneous well-defined values. Instead these quantities exist only as probability distributions which evolve continuously over time according to Schr\u00f6dinger's equation. However, it has been shown that if both position and momentum were measured simultaneously then their respective probabilities would interfere destructively resulting in a zero probability of measuring either quantity at its most probable value [1] . This phenomenon known as Heisenberg uncertainty principle leads to the concept of complementarity: the impossibility of observing all properties of a system simultaneously [2] .\nIn 1964 John Bell showed that local hidden variable theories could not explain some predictions made by quantum mechanics [3] , leading to the formulation of Bell's theorem [4] . Since then many experiments have been performed to test whether quantum mechanical predictions violate Bell's theorem [5] . These tests typically involve entangled particles [6] where each particle carries information about the state of another distant particle [7, 8] . If the particles are separated far enough so that they never interact again after being created, then the correlations between them must be due solely to quantum effects [9] ."}
{"text":"We present an experimental investigation into complementarity and quantum nonlocality using a photonic implementation of the Einstein-Bohr photon box thought experiment. We demonstrate that our system exhibits both classical correlations, which are consistent with local hidden variable theories, as well as quantum correlations, which cannot be explained by any such theory. Our results show that this system is capable of exhibiting all three types of Bell inequalities simultaneously. The Einstein-Bohr (EB) photon-box [1] , also known as the EPRB [2] or the two-slit experiment [3] , has been used to investigate many aspects of quantum mechanics including entanglement [4] , Bell's theorem [5] , and quantum teleportation [6] . In its original form it consists of a source emitting pairs of photons at random times; one photon passes through a beam splitter while the other travels directly towards a detector. If we measure whether each photon arrives at either output port of the beam splitter then there will always be exactly one photon arriving at each detector. This measurement can be performed locally on each side without disturbing the state of the other particle. However if instead we perform measurements on both particles jointly then they must arrive together at the same detector [7, 8] .\nIn order for these experiments to exhibit genuine quantum effects, the detectors need to have high efficiency so that the probability of detecting more than one photon per pair is negligible [9] . Previous implementations of EB boxes have relied upon inefficient single-photon counting detectors [10] or inefficient avalanche photo diodes [11] . These devices do not allow us to distinguish between different numbers of detected photons and therefore prevent us from observing truly quantum behaviour [12] ."}
{"text":"We present solutions for the master equations describing quantum Brownian motion (QBM) in an arbitrary environment, including external forces and non-Markovian effects. The general solution is obtained by solving the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation using path integral techniques. We show that this approach leads to exact results which are valid even when the system-environment coupling strength becomes large compared to the temperature. In particular we consider two examples where our formalism can be applied straightforwardly. First, we study QBM in a harmonic oscillator potential under the influence of white noise. Second, we investigate the effect of a time-dependent force on QBM.

{"text":"We present an analysis of the diffuse emission in the central region (r < 1 degree) of our Galaxy using data obtained with the Chandra X-Ray Observatory and Suzaku observatories, as well as archival radio continuum observations at 20 cm wavelength made by the VLA.

The latter component exhibits significant spatial variations on angular scales smaller than those expected for interstellar absorption effects alone. These results suggest that both differential absorption and emission are important factors in determining the observed spectrum of the central diffuse emission. In particular, we show that the apparent softening of the spectrum towards the center of the Galaxy can be explained if there exists a population of cold clouds along the line-of-sight toward SgrA*."}
{"text":"We consider the problem of linear regression with measurement error, where the errors are assumed to be normally distributed and uncorrelated between different measurements but correlated within each measurement set (i.e., for one given star).

This allows us to study how the accuracy of the results depends on the distribution of the number of observations over all stars. The derived formula can also be used as a tool for optimizing observational strategies by minimizing the uncertainty of the resulting estimates. In particular we show that it may be advantageous to use only a small fraction of available data points when estimating the coefficients of the model function while using most or all data points for determining its first few derivatives.

One of such theories is the so-called quintessence model which introduces a new degree of freedom into gravity - the scalar field $\\phi$ [1] . This extra degree of freedom can be used as a candidate for dark energy [2] , which may drive the current accelerated expansion of the universe [3] .\n \nIn order to test whether the observed cosmic acceleration is due to some kind of exotic matter fields like quintessence, it is important to determine accurately the value of the vacuum energy density $\\Omega_{\\Lambda}$ [4] . However, since we do not know what exactly constitutes dark energy yet, one usually assumes that its equation-of-state parameter w = p \/ rho is constant [5] . If so, then the evolution history of the universe will depend solely upon two unknown quantities, namely, $\\Omega_{\\Lambda}$ and the Hubble constant $H_0$ [6] . \n \n It should be noted here that the measurement of the Hubble constant is also very important because it provides valuable information about the age of the universe [7, 8] . For example, if one adopts the standard Friedmann-Robertson-Walker metric, then the age of the universe is given by $T_{age}=H_{0}^{-1\/3(1+z)^{1\/3}}$ [9] ."}
{"text":"The detection of exoplanets has been one of the most exciting recent developments in astronomy, but their characterization is still incomplete. The goal of this thesis was to develop new techniques for characterizing exoplanetary systems using dynamical methods. In particular, I studied how planets can be used as probes into the formation history of planetary systems by measuring the mass distribution of small bodies (planetesimals) that are trapped in mean motion resonances with them.  My first project investigated the effect of planetesimal size on the stability of planetary orbits. Using numerical simulations, we found that smaller planetesimals tend to destabilize planetary orbits more quickly than larger ones because they have higher orbital eccentricities. This result suggests that there may exist an upper limit to the size of planetesimals that form during planet migration. My second project examined the effects of mutual inclinations between planets on the stability of planetary systems. We showed that mutual inclination increases the likelihood of instability when two planets are locked in a 2:1 resonance. Finally, my third project explored the possibility of detecting terrestrial planets around white dwarfs through gravitational microlensing events."}

The main goal is to investigate whether this simple model can reproduce some of the features observed experimentally for silicate melts and glasses such as the stretched exponential decay of the intermediate scattering function or the presence of two distinct time scales in the structural relaxation process. To that end we perform molecular dynamics (MD) and Monte Carlo (MC) computer simulations on systems containing up to N = 1000 particles. In particular, by means of MC simulations we are able to study much larger systems than those accessible through MD runs. Our results show that both methods give rise to similar relaxation patterns but there exist subtle differences between them which may be relevant when comparing theory and experiment.

{"text":"We study stability properties of the splay state for a class of pulse-coupled networks with time delays and nonlinear coupling functions. We show that, under certain conditions on the parameters of the system, there exists an unstable periodic orbit embedded into the basin of attraction of the splay state. This result is illustrated by numerical simulations. PACS numbers: 05.45.Mt, 47.55.Jk, 87.19 .Hj\nI. INTRODUCTIO N\nPulse-coupled neural networks are widely used to model various phenomena observed in neuroscience [1] , such as synchronization [2] - [4] , pattern formation [5] - [8] , or information processing [9] .\nIn this work we consider a particular type of pulse-coupled systems known as delay-differential equations (DDEs) [10] - [12] . In these models each node can be described by its own internal dynamics which evolve continuously in time but interact only at discrete times when pulses are transmitted between nodes. The transmission of pulses may take some finite amount of time depending on the distance between two interacting neurons [13] . Such interactions lead to appearance of time delays in DDEs describing the evolution of the whole system [14] - [16] . Time-delayed feedbacks play important role in many biological processes [17] - [19] including brain activity [20] - [22] . For example, it has been shown experimentally [23] that the presence of time delays leads to generation of rhythmic patterns in neuronal cultures [24] . It was also demonstrated [25] that time delays have significant effect on the collective behavior of populations of coupled oscillators [26] - [28] . Another interesting feature of DDE-based models is their ability to describe nonlocal interactions [29] - [31] . Nonlinearity of couplings plays another important role in modeling real-world problems [32] - [35] . Indeed, recent experimental studies [36] suggest that synaptic connections between neurons are not linear [37] . Moreover, they often exhibit saturation effects [38] - [41] . These facts motivate us to investigate the influence of both time delays and nonlinearities on the dynamical behavior of pulse-coupled networks.\nThe main goal of our research is to analyze the stability"}
{"text":"We present the theory for anomalous diffusion in terms of fractional Fokker-Planck equations and apply it to study the time evolution of chemical reactions occurring on realistic self-affined fractals, such as porous media or biological tissues. We show that the rate at which reactants are consumed is determined by the geometry of the medium through an effective fractal dimension D(t) that evolves with time according to a nonlinear differential equation. The solution of this equation depends on the initial conditions and can be obtained numerically using standard methods. In particular we find that if the initial distribution has compact support then the system reaches equilibrium after some characteristic relaxation time t*. For times larger than t* the consumption rate becomes independent of the initial condition and coincides with the one predicted by classical mean field theories. This result suggests that the dynamics of chemical reactions in complex environments may be described by simple models based only on geometrical information about the environment."}
{"text":"The flicker noise is the low-frequency fluctuations observed in electrical resistance and other transport properties of metals at temperatures below 1 K.  The theory developed by Altshuler, Aronov, and Khmelnitsky (AAK) explains this phenomenon as arising due to electron-electron interactions within the metal film.  In their original work they assumed that electrons are scattered elastically off impurities or phonons.  However, recent experiments have shown that there can be significant inelastic scattering between electrons which leads to additional contributions to the resistivity.  Here we present an extension of AAK's theory for the case where both elastic and inelastic scattering processes contribute to the resistivity.  We show how our results compare with existing experimental data on thin gold films grown epitaxially on silicon substrates. The flicker noise is the low- frequency fluctuations observed in electrical resistance  and other transport properties of metallic systems at temperatures below 1K . It was first discovered in 1963 when measuring the resistance of thin silver wires [1] , but it has since been found in many different types of materials including semiconductors [2] , superconductors [3] , carbon nanotubes [4] , graphene [5] , and topological insulators [6] .\nIn order to explain these observations, Altshuler et al. (AAK) proposed a theoretical model based on the assumption that electrons scatter elastically off impurities [7, 8] .  This approach successfully describes most of the available experimental data [9] , however some discrepancies were recently reported [10] . These deviations may arise because the elastic approximation does not take into account possible inelastic scattering events [11] ."}
{"text":"In this paper, we propose an autonomous distributed admission control scheme to improve the performance and fairness in wireless local area networks (WLANs). The proposed scheme is based on the concept that each station maintains its own queue length information by using the packet inter-arrival time at the physical layer. In addition, it uses the number of active stations as well as their transmission rates to determine whether or not new connections are admitted into the network. We show through simulation results that our scheme can achieve better throughput than existing schemes while maintaining good fairness among competing stations. Keywords: Wireless Local Area Networks, Packet Inter-Arrival Time, Fairness, Throughput Improvement. 1 Introduction With the rapid development of mobile computing devices such as laptops, PDAs, smart phones etc., there has been growing interest in providing high quality services over wireless local area networks (WLANS) [1] . However, due to limited bandwidth resources available in WLANs, efficient resource management becomes crucially important [2] .\nThe most widely used medium access control protocol in current commercial WLAN products is the IEEE 802.11 Distributed Coordination Function (DCF), which provides both contention-based channel access mechanism called Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA\/CA) [3] , and contention-free service via Point Coordinated Function (PCF) [4] . Although CSMA\/CA allows multiple stations to share the same radio channel simultaneously without any centralized coordination, it suffers from poor system performance when the traffic load increases [5] . This problem is mainly caused by the hidden terminal effect [6] where two nodes may transmit packets to one another simultaneously causing collisions. To alleviate these problems, several approaches have been proposed [7 -10] . Among them, the authors in [8] introduced a simple but effective method known as Virtual Reservation Channel (VRC) to reduce the probability of collision between data frames transmitted by different stations. They also presented a modified version of VRC [9] to further enhance the performance of CSMA\/CA under heavy loads. However, all these works assume that the number of active stations within the"}

We show that if the potential is periodic and satisfies some mild decay conditions at infinity then there exists an explicit formula for the leading term of this expansion which involves only the first two terms of the Taylor series of the potential about zero. This result generalizes previous results obtained by one of us (S.V.) for potentials satisfying stronger decay assumptions near infinity. \nThe proof relies heavily on the fact that the spectrum of these operators consists entirely of eigenvalues of finite multiplicity. The main idea behind our approach is to use the method of matched asymptotic expansions together with suitable integral representations of the solution to obtain information about its large-$x$ behavior. In particular we prove that under appropriate hypotheses on the coefficients of the operator the solution has an exponential decay rate at infinity."}
{"text":"We study the cohomology ring structure of affine Artin groups with coefficients in any commutative ring R, which is not necessarily Noetherian or local.  We show that if R has finite Krull dimension then H*(G,R) is isomorphic to the tensor product of two polynomial rings over R (Theorem 3). If G is an infinite group we prove that H*(G,Z) is isomorphic to the exterior algebra on one generator (Theorem 4).  As consequences of these results we obtain explicit presentations for the cohomology rings of all affine Artin groups (Corollaries 5-8).\nIn particular, this gives us a presentation for the cohomology ring of the braid group B_n{\\displaystyle B} as well as its center Z(B_n){\\displaystyle {\\text{Z}(B_{n})}}.

{"text":"We present an algorithm for the calculation of ground-state properties in fermionic systems using auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC). The method is based on the use of a trial wave function that incorporates information about the broken bonds and their associated energy penalty, which are determined by exact diagonalization or density-functional theory calculations. We demonstrate our approach to calculate the electronic structure of silicon clusters Si_(n) with n = 2-10 atoms at zero temperature. Our results show good agreement with previous theoretical studies as well as experimental data obtained from photoelectron spectroscopy experiments. In addition we study the structural stability of these clusters against dissociation into smaller fragments. Finally, we discuss possible extensions of this work towards larger cluster sizes and finite temperatures. Quantum Monte Carlo methods have been widely used over recent years to solve many-body problems in condensed matter physics [1] . These techniques provide accurate estimates of physical quantities such as energies, correlation functions, and other observables within statistical uncertainties [2] .\nIn particular, the Auxiliary Field QMC (AFQMC) technique has proven very useful for studying strongly correlated electron systems [3, 4] , including materials like transition metal oxides [5] , high-temperature superconductors [6] , and heavyfermion compounds [7, 8] . This method can be applied to any system described by a local Hamiltonian H = T + V where T denotes the kinetic part and V represents the interaction between particles [9] .

We use deep near-infrared spectroscopy with Keck\/NIRSPEC to measure stellar masses for these objects, which are found to be between 3 x 10 11 and 5 x 10 11 Msun. The majority of our targets show evidence for strong starburst activity based on their high equivalent width [OIII] emission lines and large Balmer decrements indicative of dusty star-forming regions.

{"text":"We present the first dual field theory in emergent spacetime, which is derived from a unifying field theory in higher dimensional spacetime. We show that this new dual field theory can be used to describe both quantum and classical physics with one single unified description. This new dual field theory has several advantages over other existing theories such as string\/M-theory or loop quantum gravity. First, it provides an explicit mathematical formulation for describing physical phenomena at all scales ranging from microscopic scale down to macroscopic scale. Second, unlike string\/M-theory or LQG, our new dual field theory does not require any extra dimensions beyond those already observed experimentally. Third, we provide a concrete example showing how our new dual field theory works by deriving Einstein's general relativity from our new dual field theory. Finally, we also derive Maxwell's equations from our new dual field... \nIntroduction:-In recent years there have been many attempts to develop a fundamental theory of everything(TOE). String\/M-theory [1] , Loop Quantum Gravity [2] are two examples of these efforts. However, despite their successes they still suffer from some problems. For instance, string\/M-theory requires extra dimensions [3] while loop quantum gravity suffers from non-renormalizability [4] . These difficulties motivate us to look for alternative approaches towards developing TOEs. Recently, a novel approach called \"emergent spacetime\" was proposed [5, 6] . According to this approach, space-time emerges from a more fundamental level [7, 8] .\nEmergent spacetime:-The idea behind emergent spacetime is very simple. It states that space-time is not fundamental but rather emerges from a more fundamental entity. To see why this might happen consider the following argument. Imagine you are sitting on your couch watching TV. You will probably say that the world around you looks flat because if you were standing up then you would notice that the ground below you is curved. Now imagine yourself floating above Earth. If you were standing up now then you wouldn't feel like you're standing on a curved surface anymore. Instead you'd feel like you're standing on top of a"}
{"text":"We present an analytical solution for the dependence of soil moisture in a hillslope profile on saturation at its base, which is determined by groundwater table fluctuations and rainfall infiltration into the saturated zone. The model assumes that water moves downslope as gravity-driven flow through a porous medium with spatially variable hydraulic conductivity. We show how this simple conceptualization can be used to explain observed patterns of subsurface moisture distribution along hillslopes. Our results suggest that spatial variability in soil properties may play an important role in controlling hydrological processes within hillslopes. In particular, we find that topographic convergence leads to increased soil moisture near the bottom of the slope due to reduced drainage rates there. This effect becomes more pronounced when the local gradient increases or the hydraulic conductivity decreases towards the surface. These findings are consistent with field observations made during a recent study of hillslope hydrology conducted in northern California's Santa Ynez Mountains. \n \n Keywords: Hillslope hydrology, Groundwater table"}
{"text":"We present the design and performance of an extremely low-noise, high-accuracy cryogenic mechanical oscillator based on a suspended silicon nitride membrane with integrated Josephson junctions. The device is designed to operate at temperatures below 1 K in a dilution refrigerator environment. We demonstrate that this system can be used as both a highly stable reference frequency source for microwave electronics or as a sensitive probe of quantum mechanics by measuring the vacuum fluctuations of its own motion. \n \n A key requirement for many applications of quantum information science is the ability to generate and detect single photons. In order to achieve these goals it will be necessary to develop new technologies capable of generating and detecting individual quanta of light. One promising approach involves coupling semiconductor nanocrystals (quantum dots) to optical cavities such as Fabry-Perot resonators1-5. These devices are expected to have important applications ranging from quantum optics6-8 to solid-state quantum computing9-11. However, one major challenge facing their development has been achieving sufficiently large Purcell factors12-14 so that spontaneous emission rates into the cavity mode become comparable to those observed in atomic systems15-17.

{"text":"We consider an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel with multiple paths, each having different delay and gain coefficients. We assume that these channels are sparse; i.e., there is only one path whose gain coefficient exceeds some threshold value. The capacity region for this class of channels has been studied by several authors under various assumptions on the number of paths and their gains.  In particular, it was shown recently that if all the paths have equal power then the capacity region can be achieved using superposition coding at transmitter and successive decoding at receiver. However, when the powers of the paths vary widely, the optimality of such schemes remains unknown. In this work we show that even though the optimal scheme may not use superposition coding or successive decoding, its performance cannot differ significantly from those schemes. More specifically, we prove upper bounds on the gap between the achievable rates using any scheme and the sum-capacity of the channel."}
{"text":"We consider sparse multipath channels with random delays, where each path is modeled as an independent Rayleigh fading channel. We derive exact expressions for ergodic capacity and outage probability over such channels under wideband regime (i.e., when bandwidth grows without bound). Our results show that both ergodic capacity and outages are determined by the number of paths N , their average power Pn = E{|hn(t)|2}, and delay spread T . In particular, we find that ergodic capacity scales linearly with bandwidth W at high SNR if N > 2W\/\u03c0T or N < \u03c0T \/4W; otherwise it saturates to a constant value. Moreover, our analysis shows that outage probability decays exponentially fast with increasing bandwidth W if N > 4W\/\u03c0T ; otherwise it decreases only polynomially. Finally, numerical examples illustrate how these scaling laws depend on various system parameters."}
{"text":"We study the global polarization of quark gluon plasma (QGP) produced in non central heavy-ion collisions by using an effective chiral model with vector and axial-vector mesons as well as quarks and anti-quarks. We find that the global polarization is mainly determined by the initial angular momentum carried by the colliding nuclei, which can be estimated through the Glauber model. The magnitude of the global polarization decreases rapidly when the collision energy increases due to the increasing number of particles involved in the reaction. Our results show that the global polarization may reach about 10% for RHIC energies but it will decrease significantly if one goes up to LHC energies. \n \n Introduction \n \n In recent years there has been growing interest on studying the global polarization of quark-gluon plasma(QGP), especially its dependence on the collision energy [1\u20133] .

We propose an algorithm that sequentially decides which dimension to scan next based on the current measurement vector. The proposed method is shown to be optimal under certain conditions. In addition, it can also handle cases where there are multiple targets present simultaneously. Finally, numerical results show that our approach outperforms existing methods by orders of magnitude. \n \n Keywords: Scanning, sequential decision making, multi-object tracking, information-theoretic analysis \n \n 1 Introduction \n \n In many applications such as radar detection [1] , sonar [2] or computer vision [3] , one needs to detect objects (e.g., aircrafts) in multi-dimensional spaces using limited resources. For example, in air traffic control [4] , radars need to track several aircrafts at once while minimizing false alarms due to clutter noise. This task requires efficient algorithms to decide how to allocate available resources among different dimensions so that the overall performance is optimized. A common strategy used in these problems is to perform scans along each dimension separately until some stopping criterion is met. However, this may lead to suboptimal solutions since the best solution depends not only on the current measurement but also on future measurements. Therefore, it becomes necessary to develop new techniques to solve these problems more efficiently. \n \n In recent years, significant progress has been made towards solving various resource allocation problems related to multi-target tracking [5] . Most of them focus on optimizing the number of sensors [6] , their locations [7, 8] , or the sensor network topology [9] . These works assume that all target states are known exactly before performing any optimization. However, in practice, target state estimates are often uncertain because they are obtained through noisy measurements [10] . As a result, the aforementioned approaches cannot guarantee global optimality when applied directly to practical scenarios [11] . \n \n To address this issue, researchers have developed robust versions of classical resource allocation strategies [12] . They typically use worst-case formulations [13] to ensure that the resulting allocations remain feasible even if the true target states deviate significantly..."}

We find good agreement between the results of this method with those derived from observations. This work was supported by NASA grant NAG5-10842. Keywords: Binary X-rays Sources; Luminosity Function; Stellar Evolutionary Tracks. 1 Introduction X-ray binaries are composed of either two neutron stars or one neutron star plus another object such as a black hole or a white dwarf. They can be divided into three categories based on their orbital periods; short-period (P orb < 3 hrs), intermediate-period (3 hrs < P orb < 100 days), and long-period (P orb > 100 days). In addition there exist several classes of X-ray transients which have been observed at all periods but whose nature has not yet been determined conclusively [1] . These include soft X-ray transients, supersoft X-ray transients, classical novae, symbiotic stars, recurrent Novae, and microquasars [2] .\nThe number density of X-ray binaries per unit volume depends upon both the formation rate of binaries and how many survive until they become detectable [3] . Since most of them are located within 10 kpc of Earth [4] , it is possible to estimate the total number of X-ray binaries in our galaxy if we know the space density of each type of system [5] . However, since only about 10% of known Galactic X-ray binaries have measured distances [6] , it is difficult to determine the true space densities accurately.

The observed signal is consistent with theoretical predictions based on numerical simulations of magnetized cluster atmospheres. This measurement provides an important test of our understanding of magnetic fields in galaxy clusters as well as their impact on cosmological observables such as the CMB temperature anisotropies and E-mode polarizations.

The SWCNTs' diameter is assumed to be 1 nm and their length is taken as 10 microns. We use the finite element method for solving Maxwell's equations with appropriate boundary conditions at the ends of each tube. Our results show that there are two different regimes depending on the frequency range considered. In one regime, we find that the transmission coefficient decreases rapidly when increasing the number density of tubes. This behavior can be explained by considering the effect of multiple scattering between neighboring tubes. On the other hand, in another regime where the wavelength is much larger than the tube radius, the transmission coefficient increases slowly with respect to the number density of tubes due to constructive interference effects among scattered waves inside individual tubes. Finally, our numerical results indicate that the presence of defects such as vacancies or impurities may significantly affect the overall transmission properties of the system."}

We also find that the coercivity decreases rapidly when the applied field is parallel to the chain direction but remains almost unchanged for fields perpendicular to it. This indicates that the easy axis lies along the chain direction. In addition, we observe that the remanent magnetization increases gradually up to about 100 Oe after annealing the sample at 400 \u00b0C under vacuum conditions.

The first one is Einstein universe where the scale factor $a(t)$ depends only on time $t$ while the second one is Friedmann dust universe where the scale factor $a$ depends both on time $t$ and space $x$ coordinates. We found that in these two cases there are no solutions for the wave function of the universe when the initial conditions are taken into account.

{"text":"We present an argument for why quantum mechanics is nonlocal, based on the fact that it allows one to predict with certainty whether or not a measurement will be made in any given experiment. We show how this can lead to superluminal communication between two parties sharing entangled particles by using only local operations and classical communication (LOCC). Finally we generalize the Born rule to allow for arbitrary measurements instead of just von Neumann ones. The usual formulation of quantum mechanics assumes that all experiments are performed under ideal conditions where no errors occur during the preparation of states or the execution of measurements. However, in practice there always exist some experimental imperfections such as decoherence due to environmental noise, imprecision in state preparations, and inaccuracy in measurements. In order to account for these effects, several approaches have been proposed including stochastic Schr\u00f6dinger equations [1] , open systems [2] , and generalized probabilistic theories [3] . Here we consider another approach known as Quantum Bayesianism [4] .\nIn Quantum Bayesianism, the wave function is regarded as representing our knowledge about the system rather than describing its physical properties. This means that when performing a measurement, the outcome is determined by updating our knowledge according to Bayes' theorem [5] . For example, if Alice performs a measurement of spin along the x-axis on her particle, she would update her knowledge accordingly depending on what value was obtained [6] . If Bob also measures his particle's spin along the same axis but obtains different results, then he must perform a new measurement since his knowledge has changed [7, 8] ."}

{"text":"We present the results of our wide field survey for Leo II, one of the dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) in the Local Group. We have obtained deep photometry with Suprime-Cam on Subaru telescope covering an area of 1 deg2 centered at the galaxy position and detected more than 100,000 stars down to V = 26 mag. The color-magnitude diagram shows that there are two distinct populations; red giant branch stars and blue horizontal branch stars. Using these data we derived the luminosity function which is well fitted by a single power law over the magnitude range between 24 < V < 27.5. From this result we conclude that Leo II has no significant intermediate age population like other dSphs such as Fornax or Sagittarius. In addition, we found that the spatial distribution of stellar content is not smooth but clumpy. This may be due to tidal interaction with M31 and\/or MW."}

{"text":"We study the lepton-flavor-violating (LFV) decays of charged leptons induced by an exchange of heavy particles with masses above 1 TeV, which are referred to as \"unparticles\". We show that these LFV decays can be enhanced significantly if there is mixing between ordinary and exotic fermions. In particular, we find that the branching ratio for muon decay into electron plus photon may reach 10 \u22128 . This result implies that such LFV decays could be observed at future experiments like Mu3e or COMET. Introduction -Lepton Flavor Violation (LFV), i.e., the process where one observes a transition between different flavors of leptons, has been studied extensively both theoretically [1] and experimentally [2] , since it was first proposed more than thirty years ago [3] . The current experimental bounds on various LFV processes have reached impressive levels [4] .\nTheoretically speaking, many extensions beyond the Standard Model predict sizable rates for LFV processes [5] . For example, supersymmetric models [6] , left-right symmetric models [7] , and extra-dimensional theories [8] all contain new sources of LFV interactions. However, most of them require some fine-tuning and\/or introduce additional parameters so that their predictions agree well with existing data [9] . Therefore, any observation of LFV would provide strong evidence against those theoretical frameworks [10] .\nIn this work, we consider another class of models known as \"unparticle physics\" [11] . These models assume that there exist new degrees of freedom whose mass scale lies far beyond the energy range accessible to present-day accelerators [12] . Such states cannot be directly produced but they can affect low-energy observables through virtual effects [13] . It turns out that the presence of these new states leads to interesting phenomenological consequences [14] . One particularly important consequence is that they induce LFV transitions among ordinary leptons [15] . As shown below, these LFV processes can occur at observable rates even when the corresponding couplings are extremely small [16] ."}
{"text":"We propose that the prompt emission of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) is due to high-energy protons, muons and electron-positron pairs produced by ultra-relativistic shocks in GRB jets. The observed MeV-GeV spectrum can be explained as synchrotron radiation emitted by these particles accelerated at the shock front. We show that this model naturally explains why the peak energy of the observed spectrum decreases with time during the prompt phase. In addition, we find that our model predicts an anti-correlation between the duration of the prompt phase and the luminosity of the afterglow for short-hard GRBs. This prediction could be tested using future observations made by Fermi\/LAT and Swift\/BAT. Introduction -Gamma-ray bursts are brief flashes of high energy photons lasting only milliseconds or less [1] . They have been detected out to redshifts z = 8.2 [2] , which implies their total energy output may exceed 10^53 erg [3] . Despite decades of research into the origin of GRBs there remains no consensus on how they work [4] .\nThe most popular models involve either black holes or neutron stars collapsing into a black hole [5] . However, it has recently become clear that many GRBs do not fit neatly into one category [6] . For example, some GRBs appear to contain two separate pulses [7, 8] while others exhibit extended periods of activity [9] . Furthermore, some GRBs seem to occur when two galaxies merge [10] . These complexities suggest that more than one mechanism might operate simultaneously [11] .\nIn recent years several authors [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59 ] have proposed that GRBs are powered by relativistic jets e"}
{"text":"The relationship between the size of an animal's body (its mass) and that of its brain is known as allometric scaling, but it remains unclear how this relationship arises in evolution.  In particular, there are two competing hypotheses for why larger animals have bigger brains than smaller ones.   The first hypothesis suggests that larger animals need to process more information about their environment;  the second hypothesis suggests that larger animals require better coordination among different parts of their bodies.  Here we use data on the sizes of the brains and bodies of mammals ranging in size from mice to elephants to test these hypotheses against each other.  We find evidence supporting both hypotheses simultaneously - larger animals do indeed need to process more information, but they also need to coordinate activity across multiple regions of their bodies with greater precision.  Our results suggest that the evolutionary pressure driving increases in brain size may be related to the ability of large-brained animals to integrate information over space and time."}
{"text":"We present the results of our study on coriolis effects on the global oscillation modes (g-modes) in magnetized white dwarfs using one-dimensional, fully compressible numerical simulations with realistic equation-of-state and opacities. We find that the effect is significant for low-order g-modes but negligible for high-order ones. The frequency shifts are found to be proportional to the mode inertia which can be estimated by fitting the eigenfunctions obtained numerically into those calculated analytically under the thin-shell approximation. For typical parameters relevant to ZZ Ceti stars, we estimate the frequency shift due to coriolis forces to be about 0.1 % at most. This result suggests that it may not be necessary to take account of such effects when interpreting observed frequencies of pulsating white dwarf stars. However, this conclusion should be checked against more sophisticated models including rotation as well as magnetic fields."}
{"text":"We propose that the dark matter in our universe is composed of milli-charged particles, which are neutral under electromagnetism but carry an electric charge on the order of 10^(-6)e (electrons). We show how this scenario can be realized within the context of the Standard Model by introducing a new gauge boson with mass mX ~ 1TeV\/c2 into the theory through the Stueckelberg extension to the Standard Model. The introduction of such a massive vector particle leads to modifications to the usual Feynman rules for charged fermions interacting via photons or gluons. In particular, we find that the cross section for scattering between two milli-charged particles mediated by a photon is suppressed compared to the case where there were no additional massive vector boson present. This suppression results in a reduction of the number density of milli-charged dark matter particles at late times as they annihilate more slowly than their un-massive counterparts."}
{"text":"We present new X-ray data on the eclipsing polar, V2301 Oph (=V1429 Aql), obtained with XMM-Newton in 2003 and 2004 . The light curve shows two partial eclipses at orbital phases 0.85-0.95 and 0.65-0.75 which are interpreted as occultations by the accretion curtain. We find that the eclipse profiles change significantly between the two epochs. In particular, we detect an additional dip during phase 0.9-1.0 in 2004 which is not seen in 2003. This feature may be associated with the presence of a third body orbiting around the system. The spectrum can be described well using a combination of a blackbody component for the white dwarf and a power law model for the hard emission. From our spectral fits to both datasets we derive values for the temperature T wd = 16000 \u00b1 1000 K and luminosity L x = 1.1 \u00d7 1031 erg s\u22121 for the white dwarf."}

The data are used to derive the temperature distribution within dense cores identified by their infrared emission using the method developed by John Myers & Sean Carey. We find that most of these cores have temperatures between 10 K and 20 K with only one colder than 8 K. This is consistent with previous studies showing that cold cores are rare in star-forming clouds. Using our derived temperatures we calculate masses assuming optically thin greybody emission. These masses range from 0.1 Msun to more than 100 Msun. In addition, we use the same dataset to study the properties of protostars embedded in the RO region.

The observed luminosities are comparable to those found for ultraluminous infrared galaxies, but the ratios between these lines suggest that this is not an active galactic nucleus (AGN) dominated source. Instead we propose that the high-excitation molecular gas may be associated with a young massive starburst which has recently been triggered by tidal interactions and\/or mergers. We also find evidence for a compact radio continuum source at the center of the galaxy, consistent with previous observations. This suggests that there could be a deeply-embedded AGN present within the central few hundred parsecs.  These results provide new insights into how such powerful sources can form during the early stages of galaxy evolution."}
{"text":"We study non-Abelian hydrodynamic equations for fluids with spin-orbit coupling, which are derived by applying Noether's theorem to an action functional describing the dynamics of such systems. We show that these equations can be written as a system of conservation laws for charge current density J\u03bcc , energy-momentum tensor T\u03bc\u03bd and spin current density JS\u03bc . The latter is given by a sum over all particles of their individual spins S\u03b1 multiplied by certain coefficients depending on the particle type \u03b1 = e, \u03bc, \u03c4 .\nThe resulting transport coefficients are calculated explicitly using kinetic theory methods. In particular we find that the shear viscosity \u03b7s vanishes identically if there exists at least one electrically charged fermion species (e.g., electrons) or if the fluid contains only neutral bosons like photons. This result holds both for relativistic and nonrelativistic fluids. Furthermore, we calculate the bulk viscosities for various examples including QED plasma, superfluid helium-4, and ultracold atomic gases. Finally, we discuss how our results could be used to describe the collective motion of atoms in Bose-Einstein condensates. \nI. INTRODUCTORY REMARK\nIn this work we consider fluids whose constituents have internal degrees of freedom described by quantum fields. Examples include plasmas consisting of charged particles interacting via electromagnetic field, superfluids made up of neutral bosonic atoms, and cold atom clouds where the atoms are treated as distinguishable particles.

{"text":"We present an analysis of the distribution of gas, stars and dust in two nearby edge-on spirals with prominent bars (NGC 1365 and NGC 1530). We use high-resolution observations obtained by the Herschel Space Observatory to study the physical conditions of the interstellar medium along these systems. The main results are as follows:  - In both cases we find that the molecular hydrogen is concentrated on the leading edges of the bar, while atomic hydrogen follows closely the stellar light.  - The star formation rate peaks at the ends of the bar where the density of molecular hydrogen increases significantly. This suggests that the gravitational torques induced by the bar can trigger the collapse of dense clouds into new generations of young stars.  - The infrared emission associated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons shows a clear correlation between the location of this component and the regions of active star formation. - The comparison of our data with hydrodynamical simulations indicates that the observed structure of the ISM may be explained if the bar potential has been able to drive significant amounts of cold gas towards its inner Lindblad resonance."}

{"text":"We present new near-infrared (NIR) polarimetric observations of the Herbig Ae star HD 142527, which reveal that its circumstellar dust is composed of two distinct populations with different grain sizes. The polarization degree decreases rapidly towards longer wavelengths at all positions along our slit except for one position where it increases again between 2.2 and 3.8 microns. We interpret this as evidence for an inner hole in the distribution of larger grains. This interpretation is supported by SED modeling using radiative transfer calculations including scattering off spherical particles. Our results suggest that the outer edge of the gap lies within 0.1 AU of the central star. In addition to the NIR data presented here we also obtained mid-infrared (MIR) spectro-polarimetry covering the wavelength range 5-20 micron.

{"text":"We present the general sigma model with external sources for the electroweak interactions in four dimensions and discuss its spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB). The SSB is achieved by introducing an auxiliary field which has no physical degrees of freedom but plays an important role to generate masses for gauge bosons as well as fermions. We show that this mechanism can be realized even if we start with massless fermions at tree level. In addition, we find that there are two different ways to break the electroweak symmetry spontaneously depending on whether or not the Higgs doublet acquires vacuum expectation value. Finally, we study how the SSB affects the renormalization group equations (RGEs), especially those for the gauge coupling constants.

INTRODUCTORY REMARK\nThe Standard Model (SM) of particle physics describes all known fundamental particles and their interactions except gravity [1] . It consists of three generations of quarks and leptons interacting via the exchange of vector bosons such as photons, W \u00b1 , Z 0 and gluons [2] . However, it does not explain why these particles have non-zero masses nor what causes them to interact with each other [3] .\nIn order to address these issues, one needs to go beyond the SM framework [4] . One possible extension is to introduce new scalar fields into the theory so that they may acquire non-vanishing vacuum expectation values (VEVs) [5] . These scalars then provide masses to the SM particles through Yukawa couplings [6] . Another possibility is to extend the gauge sector of the SM [7, 8] . For example, Grand Unified Theories (GUTs) unify the strong nuclear force with electromagnetism [9] while Supersymmetric GUTs also include spin-1\/2 partners for every SM particle [10] ."}

We find that most of these objects lie close to galaxies brighter than R = 20 mag, suggesting they may be associated with galaxy clusters rather than individual galaxies. However, we also identify two cases where the source is apparently offset from its nearest neighbour by more than 1 arcmin, making it unlikely that this association can explain all our candidates. In addition, one object lies within an extended region of diffuse emission, while another has no obvious host galaxy despite lying only 3 arcsec away from a very faint galaxy."}

In addition we show that the diffusion coefficients follow the Stokes-Einstein relation only when plotted as functions of the structural relaxation time. This is explained by considering the role played by elastic stresses on particle mobility.

{"text":"We present here an overview of our survey, which is aimed at tracing the evolution in the number density and luminosity function (LF) of galaxies as a function of their stellar masses up to z ~ 1.5. The sample consists of about 10 000 objects selected by photometric redshifts using deep optical data obtained with FORS2@VLT+WFI@ESO\/MPG 2.2m telescope + Spitzer IRAC 3.6 & 4.5 micron bands. We use this dataset to study how the LF evolves for different ranges of stellar masses. In particular we find that the faint-end slope of the LF becomes steeper towards higher redshift indicating that less massive systems are more abundant than today. This result can be explained if star formation activity was more efficient in low-mass halos at high-z compared to local universe. Finally, we compare these results with those derived from other surveys finding good agreement between them."}
{"text":"The dust around the star Beta Pictoris is being studied by astronomers at Harvard University, using data collected with NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope.  The researchers are studying how the dust particles interact with each other to form larger bodies that may eventually become planets.   They have found evidence for two different types of dust grains in this system; one type has been observed previously but not the second.    This new dust grain appears to be much smaller than those seen before (about 100 times smaller).   It also seems to be more reflective or transparent than previous observations would suggest.   These findings could help explain why some stars appear brighter when they are younger while others do not. Astronomers are trying to understand how planetary systems form.  One way to study planet formation is through observing young stars like Beta Pictoris which is about 20 million years old.  Beta Pictoris is surrounded by an enormous amount of dust produced as it sheds its outer layers during its youthful evolution.   In addition there is gas surrounding the star that forms into spiral patterns similar to those seen in our own solar system.   Scientists believe these dust particles will collide and stick together over time forming larger objects such as asteroids and comets.   Eventually these large bodies can grow even bigger and start orbiting the central star creating what we call \"planets\".   However, scientists don't know exactly how this process happens because it's very difficult to observe directly.   Instead, astronomers use telescopes to look at light coming from the dusty environment around young stars.   By analyzing the light emitted by the dust particles,..."}
{"text":"In this work, we study the spectral efficiency (SE) performance of spectrum pooling systems in which multiple secondary users share the same licensed band with one primary user. We consider two different scenarios for the SE analysis: 1) The case where all secondary users are located at fixed distances away from each other and 2) The case where they are randomly distributed over an area according to some spatial distribution function. In both cases, we assume that there is no direct communication between any pair of secondary users. For scenario 1), we derive closed-form expressions for the ergodic capacity of the system under Rayleigh fading channels as well as Nakagami-m fading channels. Our results show that when the number of secondary users increases, their mutual interference becomes more severe resulting in lower ergodic capacities. However, if the distance between them decreases or equivalently, the density of secondary users increases, then the ergodic capacity improves due to higher signal-to-noise ratio levels."}

{"text":"We present an extended fractal fit to the zeros of the Riemann zeta function, which is based on the idea that the distribution of these zeros can be described by a self-similar structure with a finite number of scaling parameters. The resulting formula for the density of zeros has been tested against numerical data and found to agree well in the region between 1 and 10 millionth decimal places. We also show how this new approach leads naturally to a prediction about the location of the first zero outside the critical strip. \nIntroduction\n\nThe Riemann hypothesis states that all non-trivial zeros of the Riemann z\u00eata-function $\\zeta(s)$ lie on the line $\\sigma = 1$ (the so-called critical strip). In other words, it says that there are no zeros off the real axis. This conjecture was formulated more than 150 years ago but remains unsolved today. \n\nIn recent years several authors have proposed models for the distribution of the zeros of $\\zeta(s) \\sim \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^s} $ using concepts such as fractals or multifractals [1]-[3] . These approaches lead to formulas for the density of zeros which depend on one or two free parameters only. However, they do not provide any information about the position of individual zeros.\n\nIn this article we propose a different model for the distribution of zeros which takes into account their self-similarity properties [4] , i.e., the fact that the distribution of zeros looks similar at different scales. Our main result is a formula for the density of the zeros which depends on three free parameters only. It turns out that our ansatz provides good agreement with numerical results up to $10^{10}$ decimal digits. Moreover, we use our method to predict the location of the first known zero outside the critical strip.  \n\nSelf-similarity of the zeros \n\nLet us consider the set $Z_n$ consisting of all zeros of $\\zeta(\\sigma + it)$ where $t \\in [0,n]$.

{"text":"We present the results of our calculation for two-photon transition rates between excited states of atomic hydrogen, including all relevant bound-bound and bound-free processes. We use these results to calculate the evolution of the number density of neutral hydrogen atoms during cosmic reionization. The main goal is to study how this process depends on the properties of the first stars that ionize the universe. \n \n In particular we focus on the effect of different stellar initial mass functions (IMF) on the ionization history of the universe. For example, if massive stars are more numerous than low-mass ones then they will produce more photons per unit time which can lead to faster reionization. On the other hand, if most of the energy released by the first stars goes into winds or supernovae explosions rather than radiation then less UV photons would be produced leading to slower reionization. Our calculations show that the IMF has only minor effects on the overall duration of reionization but it does affect its detailed shape."}
{"text":"We present the results of our theoretical study on massive planet migration in protoplanetary disks, focusing on its dependence on disk properties such as viscosity and surface density profiles. We find that the type I migration rate is strongly dependent on the disk's viscosity profile; it decreases for higher viscosities at small radii but increases again beyond a certain radius (typically 1 AU). This behavior can be explained by considering the balance between corotation torques and Lindblad torques. In addition to this effect, we also found that the mass accretion onto planets changes significantly depending on their orbital distance due to the change in gas pressure gradient across the gap opened up by the planet. Finally, we compare these theoretical predictions with recent observational data obtained using direct imaging techniques. Our results suggest that there are two possible scenarios for explaining the observed distribution of exoplanets: either they formed very close to their host stars or they underwent significant inward migration after formation."}

{"text":"We present the first results on chemical enrichment in cosmological simulations with supernova feedback. We use two different implementations for stellar winds and supernovae (SNe) to study their effects on galaxy formation. The wind implementation is based on kinetic energy injection into gas particles that are above some threshold density; SNe explode as thermal energy injections at random locations within star forming regions. Our main conclusions are:  1. Winds alone cannot reproduce observed metallicities in galaxies.  2. In our fiducial model we find good agreement between simulated and observed metallicity distributions over four orders of magnitude in luminosity. 3. Simulated metal mass fractions agree well with observations out to z = 5. 4. Metal-rich stars form preferentially in massive haloes because they have more time available to enrich themselves through multiple generations of star formation. 5. Gas cooling rates are suppressed by metals produced by previous generations of stars."}
{"text":"We present new results on the formation of bipolar lobes by an expanding, rotating surface explosion (a \"rotating detonation\"). We use two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations to show that such explosions can form disks with large opening angles if they are not too energetic or fast-expanding. The disk is formed because the outer layers of the star are swept up into a thin shell as it expands outward at high speed; this shell then breaks apart due to Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities. As the shell fragments, material falls back onto the central region of the exploded star forming two opposite jets which break out along the poles of the system. These jets drive the expansion of the bipolar lobes. Our models reproduce many observed properties of the Homunculus: its size, shape, kinematics, chemical composition, and luminosity evolution. In addition, we find that our model predicts a total mass loss rate for \u03b7 Carinae during the Great Eruption of ~10^\u22124 M_sun\/yr, consistent with observations."}

This result suggests that dust grains are not being destroyed or created on short timescales within the ring. In addition, we detect a small degree of circularly polarized light emerging from the central region of the ring which may be due to scattering off non-spherical particles such as ice crystals. \n \n We also report results from our analysis of archival Hubble Space Telescope images showing that the ring has remained remarkably stable since its discovery more than 20 years ago.

The results show that there is no significant difference between the two samples; both exhibit very hard spectra and high luminosities. This suggests that the physical processes responsible for producing X-rays do not depend strongly on quasar luminosity or redshift.

{"text":"We study the existence and uniqueness of equilibrium states for some classes of potentials in the presence of an external magnetic field, using results on the asymptotic behavior of solutions to Schr\u00f6dinger equations obtained by J. Bourgain and M. Goldstein.  We consider potentials which are bounded below but not necessarily convex or even continuous; we also allow the external magnetic fields to be time-dependent (but still periodic). In particular, our results apply to the case where the potential is given by the sum of a quadratic form plus a small perturbation. The main tool used here is the so-called ``Bourgain-Goldstein method'', which consists in studying the evolution of the Wigner transform of the solution to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation under the action of the unitary group generated by the corresponding Hamiltonian. \nIntroduction\n\nThe purpose of this article is to prove that there exists at most one equilibrium state associated to certain classes of potentials in the context of quantum mechanics when these potentials interact with an external magnetic field. This result was first proved by D. Ruelle [Ru] , who showed that if V : T d \u2192 R satisfies suitable conditions then there exists exactly one equilibrium measure \u00b5V . These assumptions include the fact that V should have superlinear growth at infinity and satisfy a condition known as ``uniform ellipticity''. However, it turns out that many interesting examples do not fall into this category. For example, let us mention the following two examples:  \u2022 If V = \u2212|x| 2 + |y| 2 , then V does not grow faster than linearly at infinity."}

We have obtained high-resolution near-infrared images with adaptive optics at Keck Observatory that reveal a bright ring-like structure surrounding the pulsar's position. This feature has been interpreted as emission from dust grains orbiting within the disk produced by the supernova explosion that created both stars. \n \n In addition to this ring, we detect faint extended emission extending out to several hundred AU on either side of the central source. These features are consistent with previous results based on lower resolution data. However, our higher spatial resolution reveals additional details about these structures. For example, we find evidence for spiral arms in the outer regions of the disk, which may be caused by gravitational interactions between the disk and the binary companion."}

We show that there is an infinite number of inequivalent string vacua with different gauge groups and matter contents. The massless spectrum depends only on the choice of the orbifold group but not on its embedding into the E8xE8 or SO(32) symmetry groups. In particular we find that all these models have at least one vector-like pair of quarks and leptons transforming as doublets under SU(4). This result implies that the standard model can be realized within this class of models without any additional Higgs fields. Furthermore, we discuss how to obtain realistic particle spectra for phenomenological applications. Finally, we comment on some open problems related to the construction of chiral fermion models in higher dimensional space-time."}

The second object, Hen 3-1341, has been previously classified as a luminous blue variable (LBV), but our new data show it contains a compact core embedded within a shell-like structure. We argue that both objects are likely to have experienced recent mass loss events similar to those inferred for SN 1987A's progenitor prior to its final collapse into a black hole. These results suggest that LBVs could also be viable candidates for future supernovae.

INTRODUCTIO N\nIn many applications it is important to know how accurately one can determine the position where a photon hits a detector. For example this information is needed when designing optical instruments like telescopes [1] . In order to measure the spatial resolution of a detector we need to have some reference point against which we compare our measured data [2] .\nOne way to obtain this reference point is to use a light source emitting photons at a well-defined angle relative to the normal direction [3] , see Fig.  1(a) . If the detector has no intrinsic spatial resolution, all detected photons will come from a small area around the center of the detector surface. By scanning the detector over different angles \u03b8, we can find out what fraction of the total number of counts comes from each part of the detector [4] . We call these fractions the response function R(\u03b8) of the detector [5] . Knowing the shape of the response function allows us to calculate the spatial resolution of the detector [6] . However, if there is more than one pixel per unit solid angle, the situation becomes complicated because now several pixels could detect a given photon [7, 8] .

The first type is characterized by one light quark in the final state while the second has no light quarks in it. In both cases there is only one spectator quark which leads to a helicity suppression of the corresponding decay rates. However, they may still serve as useful probes of new physics since their CP-violating asymmetries could be enhanced significantly compared to those of other modes [1] .\nTheoretically, such decays have been studied within various approaches including naive factorization [2] , perturbative QCD [3] , soft-collinear effective theory [4] , and QCD factorization [5] - [8] . It was found that the predictions based on different methods differ substantially among themselves. For example, using naive factorization, Ref.

However, these materials usually suffer from poor thermal stability or high cost [10] . Therefore, searching for new materials showing GMCE remains one of the most important topics in condensed matter physics [11] - [13] . On the other hand, recent studies suggest that quantum fluctuations may play an essential role in enhancing GMCE [14] - [16] . Thus, it would be interesting to investigate whether GMCE could exist in quantum magnets [17] - [20] .\nIn this work, we consider the spin-1\/2 Heisengerg antiferromagnet on the square lattice with competing nearestneighbor and next-nearest-neighbor exchange interactions [21] .

The new model includes two additional parameters that are determined by fitting the theoretical predictions for the luminosity distance as function of redshift to observational data obtained from type Ia supernovae. We find that the best-fit values of these parameters depend strongly on the assumed value of the Hubble constant H0. For example, if we assume H0 = 65 km s-1 Mpc-1 then our results indicate that the universe contains about 30% more mass than predicted by the standard CDM model. If instead we use H0 = 50 km s-1 Mpc1 then this fraction increases to 70%.

The final planetary mass depends primarily on the initial disk surface density profile at large radii (>100 AU), which determines how much material can be transported inward before it dissipates. In addition, we show that the composition of the disk has only minor effects on the resulting planet properties.

{"text":"We present the results of numerical simulations of planetary systems around binary stars, focusing on the effects of orbital migration due to tidal interaction between planets and their host star(s). We find that for most initial conditions considered here (except those with very small semi-major axes), the final orbits are generally circularized by tides raised on the planet by its host star(s); this is true even if the original orbit was eccentric or inclined relative to the binary's plane.  The final mass distribution of planets depends strongly on the initial semimajor axis of the planet. For large values of the initial semi-major axis, we find that the final masses tend to be smaller than the initial ones because of significant inward migration driven by tidal dissipation inside the planet. On the other hand, when the initial semi-major axis is relatively small compared to the binary separation, the final masses can become larger than the initial ones as a result of outward migration caused by tidal friction acting at the surface of the planet."}
{"text":"We present the theory behind relativistic fluctuation theorems, which are exact relations between entropy production in nonequilibrium processes and fluctuations in equilibrium states. We show that these results can be derived using only standard statistical mechanics techniques applied to systems with time-reversal symmetry breaking interactions. In particular we derive an expression for the entropy production rate in terms of correlation functions at thermal equilibrium. This result is used to calculate the entropy production rates associated with several simple models including Brownian motion, Langevin dynamics, and driven harmonic oscillators. Finally, we discuss how our approach may be extended beyond classical physics. Relativistic fluctuation theorems provide exact relations between entropy production during non-equilibrium processes and fluctuations in corresponding equilibrium states. These results have been obtained by applying standard statistical mechanics methods to systems with broken timereversal invariance. Here we use this formalism to obtain expressions for the entropy production rate as well as other quantities such as heat currents in terms of correlation functions evaluated at thermal equilibrium. As concrete applications we consider several simple models including Browninan motion, Langevin dynamics and driven harmonic oscillators. \n \n 1 Introduction \n \n Entropy production plays a central role in many areas of science ranging from biology [1] , chemistry [2] , geophysics [3] , and neuroscience [4] . It has also become increasingly important in quantum information processing [5] where it provides a measure of irreversibility [6] . Despite its importance there remains no general method for calculating entropy production rates except in very special cases [7\u20139] .

{"text":"We present the results for the next-to-leading-order (NLO) perturbative QCD calculations on the decay amplitudes and branching fractions of some important exclusive charmless hadronic B meson decays, such as $B\\to\\pi\\pi$, $B\\to\\piK$, and $B\\to\\pi\\pi\\pi$. The NLO contributions are found to be large numerically compared with those at leading order. We also discuss how these new theoretical predictions can help us understand experimental data better. \n \n Introduction \n \n In recent years there has been great progress made both experimentally and theoretically in studying rare B meson decays into three light pseudoscalars [1] . These processes provide an excellent opportunity to test our understanding of weak interactions and CP violation beyond the Standard Model [2] , since they involve only one-loop electroweak penguin diagrams [3] . On the other hand, it is very difficult to calculate their decay rates precisely because of the presence of nonperturbative strong interaction effects [4] . \n \n It was shown that the decay amplitude $A(B\\to\\pi\\pi)$ receives significant higher order corrections due to final state interactions [5] . Recently, several groups have calculated the next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) corrections [6] - [8] using different approaches. However, all these works were done within the framework of heavy quark effective theory [9] or soft-collinear effective theory [10] . As pointed out by Beneke et al. [11] , the NNLO calculation based on these two theories may not give reliable numerical results when applied directly to physical quantities like decay widths and branching ratios. This problem arises mainly because the factorization scale dependence cancels between the Wilson coefficients and matrix elements only partially [12] . To overcome this difficulty, Beneke et al. proposed to use the renormalization group improved perturbation theory [13] instead of the conventional approach [14] . They showed explicitly that the resulting decay rate agrees well with experiment [15] . \nIn this work we will follow Ref.

{"text":"We study the elasticity of thin films with periodic microstructure, which are constrained to lie on an underlying substrate. We show that such systems can exhibit anomalously large values for their Young's moduli as well as Poisson ratios. The origin of these effects is traced back to the presence of phonon soft modes associated with the periodicity along the film normal direction. These results have implications for the design of novel materials with tailored elastic properties. \n \n In recent years there has been growing interest in understanding how confinement affects the physical behavior of matter at the nanoscale [1] . This problem arises naturally when considering thin films or nanowires embedded within bulk materials; however it also applies more generally whenever a system is restricted to occupy only part of its available phase space [2] . For example, this situation occurs frequently during crystal growth where defects may be introduced into the lattice structure by impurities [3] , or when studying colloidal suspensions [4] .\n \nIn this work we consider the case of a thin film with periodic microstructure, whose thickness h lies between two length scales L and d (see Fig 1) . Here L represents the typical size of the unit cell while d denotes the characteristic spacing between adjacent layers; both quantities are assumed to be much smaller than the in-plane dimensions of the sample. Such structures arise commonly in nature, e.g., in layered compounds like graphite [5] , transition metal dichalcogenides [6] , and hexagonal boron nitride [7] . They are also used extensively in technological applications ranging from photovoltaics [8] to optoelectronics [9] . \n \n Figure 1: Schematic illustration of our model geometry.

{"text":"We present new solar models that are consistent with the helioseismic data and reproduce the observed frequencies of acoustic modes in the Sun to better than 0.1% accuracy for degrees l = 0, 1, 2, 3 (n = 0 - 4). We use these models to calculate theoretical frequency separations between adjacent radial orders n for different degree l values as functions of the mean density $\\rho_0$ at the base of the convection zone. The results show that the ratio of the frequency separations for l = 1 and l = 0 is sensitive to the heavy-element abundances near the surface of the Sun. This sensitivity can be used to determine the relative amount of heavy elements in the outer layers of the Sun by comparing the calculated frequency separations with those inferred from observations. \n \n In this work we apply our method to infer the heavy-element abundance profile in the Sun using the recently published high-precision measurements of the mode frequencies obtained by GOLF on board SOHO spacecraft.

{"text":"We have searched for radio transients with flux densities between 0.1 and 1 mJy at frequencies ranging from 4 to 8 GHz using archival data obtained by the Very Large Array (VLA) over the past 20 years. We find that most of these sources are extragalactic, but we also detect several Galactic objects including pulsars, supernova remnants, and flare stars. The majority of our sample is comprised of previously uncatalogued sources; however, we recover many known variable sources such as blazars and gamma-ray burst afterglows. Our results demonstrate the power of combining large amounts of archival VLA data into one coherent dataset. This work was supported by NSF grant AST-0907860. In this Letter, we present an analysis of all available archived Very Large Array (V LA) observations taken since 1990. These data were collected during various observing programs aimed primarily at studying distant galaxies or nearby star forming regions. However, they contain valuable information about fainter transient phenomena occurring within our Galaxy. By searching through more than 10 000 hours of observation time spread across nearly 2000 epochs, we identify thousands of new faint radio sources which appear only once or twice in each epoch's data set. Most of these sources are extragalaxtic, but we also detect numerous Galactic objects including pulsar wind nebulae, supernova remnants, flare stars, and other types of active galactic nuclei. Many of these newly discovered sources are not included in existing catalogs because their low signal-to-noise ratio makes them difficult to detect when observed individually. However, by combining multiple epochs together, we can boost the sensitivity of our survey enough to detect even very weak signals."}

We find that planets are less likely to be found around close visual doubles than single stars (<2 AU), but more likely to be found around wide visual doubles or triples (>20 AU). The difference between these two populations is statistically significant at greater than 3-sigma confidence level. These results suggest that stellar multiplicity may play some role in shaping planetary system architectures.

{"text":"We propose that the cosmic acceleration data can be explained by bulk-brane energy exchange between branes in higher dimensions, which is similar to the dark matter effect on our universe. We show how this mechanism works for both open and closed universes with positive cosmological constant. The model predicts an accelerating expansion rate at late time as well as a decelerated one at early times. This prediction agrees very well with current observations. In addition, we find that the present value of the Hubble parameter H0 = 72 \u00b1 8 km s-1 Mpc-1 is consistent with recent measurements. Finally, we discuss some possible tests of the theory using future experiments such as SNAP satellite project. Introduction:-The discovery of accelerated expansion of the universe has been made recently [1] . It was found that the universe expands faster than expected if it were dominated only by normal matter [2] , so there must exist another component called \"dark energy\" [3] - [6] responsible for the observed phenomenon. However, the nature of dark energy remains unknown. Many models have been proposed to explain its origin [7] - [11] .\nIn this letter, we will consider a new approach based on the idea of extra dimensions [12] - [14] . According to these theories, our four-dimensional world may live on a three-dimensional surface (3-brane) embedded in a five dimensional space-time (bulk). If gravity propagates into the bulk then it could affect the motion of particles living on the 3-brane [15] - [17] . For example, if the gravitational field of a distant galaxy lives outside the 3-brane but inside the bulk, then its gravitational force would act upon us even though the galaxy itself does not appear directly in front of us [18] . Thus, the presence of extra dimensions leads to additional effects beyond those predicted by general relativity [19] - [21] ."}
{"text":"We study the gravitational instability (GI) in two differentially rotating, self-gravitating disks with and without magnetic fields using three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations. We find that GI can occur at large radii for both cases but is suppressed by strong magnetic fields near the central star. The disk mass required to trigger GI decreases as the radius increases because the Toomre Q parameter becomes smaller due to weaker stellar gravity. For the case without magnetic fields, we also investigate how the initial density distribution affects the growth rate of GI. Our results show that the growth time scale depends on the radial profile of surface density. In addition, we examine whether or not GI leads to fragmentation. Fragmentation occurs only when the disk has an initially steep surface density gradient. Finally, we discuss possible implications of our findings for planet formation. Gravitational instability (GI), which causes spiral arms to form in gravitationally bound systems such as galaxies, may play important roles in various astrophysical phenomena including planet formation. However, it remains unclear if GI operates in protoplanetary disks around young stars since these disks are magnetized and their rotation profiles are complicated. Here, we perform 3D hydrodynamical simulations to explore this issue."}

Finally, it should be noted that the proposed approach can also be used as a tool for analyzing other types of networks such as social or economic ones. In recent years there has been growing interest in studying complex dynamical behaviors of biological systems [1] . One important aspect of these studies concerns how different components interact within a cell [2] , which leads naturally to mathematical models based on chemical kinetics [3] .\nThe most common type of kinetic modeling involves ordinary differential equations (ODEs) [4] describing interactions between various molecular species [5] . However, due to the complexity of cellular processes [6] , many ODE models contain several state variables [7, 8] and\/or parameters [9] whose values cannot always be determined experimentally [10] . This uncertainty may lead to significant errors when estimating the behavior of the underlying system [11] . To overcome this problem, stochastic approaches have recently been developed [12] . Another possibility consists in considering uncertainties in the form of unknown external disturbances [13] ."}
{"text":"We introduce the notion of an algebra over a monoidal category and show that it is equivalent to the notion of a coalgebra in the dual category, which we call a comonoid.  We then define the cyclic homology of such algebras as the Hochschild cohomology of their underlying comonoids with coefficients in the bimodule given by the tensor product of the algebra with its opposite algebra.  This definition generalizes the usual one for ordinary algebras over fields or rings.   In particular, if the base ring has characteristic zero, this recovers the classical definitions of cyclic homology and periodic cyclic homology.  The same construction also works for Hopf algebroids instead of ordinary algebras;  however, there are some subtleties arising when trying to extend these results to arbitrary commutative rings.    Finally, we give several examples illustrating our constructions. Cyclic homology was introduced by Connes in his seminal work on noncommutative geometry [Con] . It can be defined as the Hochschild homology of certain algebras called cyclic objects. These were first studied systematically by B\u00f6kstedt [B\u00f6k] , who showed how they could be used to construct new algebraic structures like crossed modules and group extensions. Since then, many authors have investigated various aspects of cyclic objects and their applications. For example, see [Fri1] , [Fri2] , [Koc] , [Lau] , [Maz] , [Nee] , [Sta] .\nIn this article, we will study cyclic objects in more detail using techniques developed recently in the theory of operads and monads. Our main result shows that any cyclic object gives rise to two different types of cyclic homologies, namely the cyclic homology of the underlying algebra and the periodic cyclic homology of the associated graded algebra. Moreover, both of them can be computed explicitly in terms of the structure maps defining the cyclic object. As a consequence, we obtain explicit formulas for the cyclic homology of all finite-dimensional cocommutative Hopf algebras over a field of characteristic 0."}
{"text":"We study the internal state of an assembly of spherical particles in two dimensions during its assembling process by means of numerical simulations. We show that the packing fraction increases with time as t1\/3 for small values of t (the number of added particles) but it saturates to a constant value at large times. The saturation occurs when the system reaches a jammed configuration which can be characterized by a finite pressure Pc(\u03c6). In this regime we find that the average coordination number z grows linearly with \u03c6 while the distribution of contacts per particle follows a power law decaying function. Finally, we analyze how the structure of the contact network evolves with increasing density showing that the degree distribution becomes more heterogeneous. Granular materials are collections of macroscopic grains interacting through dissipative forces [1] . They have been widely studied both experimentally [2] , numerically [3] and theoretically [4] due to their relevance in many industrial processes such as pharmaceutical manufacturing or food processing [5] .\nIn recent years there has been growing interest on understanding the properties of these systems [6] - [8] since they share some features with other complex networks [9] like social [10] or biological [11] ones. For example, the statics [12] and dynamics [13] of dense granular media resemble those observed in glassy [14] and jamming [15] systems respectively. Moreover, the mechanical response [16] and transport [17] of granular matter also shares similarities with earthquakes [18] and traffic [19] phenomena. Despite all these analogies, however, granular matter still presents important differences with respect to other types of disordered solids [20] mainly because of the presence of friction [21] .\nThe main goal of our work is to understand the microstructure of granular assemblies [22] . To do so, we consider a two-dimensional system composed of N identical disks of diameter d arranged into a square box of side L = 100d. Particles interact via repulsive elastic collisions [23] and gravity [24] . Initially, the system contains only one disk located at the center of the box [25] .

{"text":"We study the internal state of an isotropic packing of frictionless spherical particles under compression, decompression and cyclic loading by means of numerical simulations using molecular dynamics (MD). We find that the volume fraction increases with increasing applied stress in all cases studied here. The increase of the volume fraction during unloading is smaller than for loading at similar stresses. This hysteresis effect becomes more pronounced as the number of load-unload cycles increases. In addition to this we observe that the distribution function of contact forces changes significantly between different stages of the process. These results are discussed within the framework of elastic-plastic models of granular materials. Granular matter can be found everywhere around us; it forms the basis of many natural phenomena such as avalanches or landslides on mountainsides [1] , mudflow [2] , sedimentation [3] , soil mechanics [4] , earthquakes [5] .

{"text":"We present a real-time renormalization-group approach for calculating the current through an interacting quantum dot coupled to leads at finite bias voltage, temperature, and gate voltage. We show that this method allows us to calculate the current as well as the time-dependent density matrix with high accuracy even when the system is far away from equilibrium. The results are compared to those obtained by numerically solving the Kadanoff-Baym equations within the Keldysh formalism. In particular we find excellent agreement between both methods if one chooses the cutoff scale appropriately. This shows that our method can be used to study strongly correlated systems out of equilibrium without any restriction on the strength of interactions or the coupling to external reservoirs. \nI. INTRODUCTIO N\nThe transport properties of nanoscale devices such as single-molecule transistors [1] , carbon nanotubes [2] , semiconductor nanowires [3] , and quantum dots [4] have attracted considerable interest over recent years due to their potential applications in future electronic circuits [5] . However, it has been shown recently [6] that these devices often operate far away from thermal equilibrium which makes theoretical predictions based on standard approaches like the LandauerB\u00fcttiker formula [7, 8] questionable [9] .\nIn order to describe non-equilibrium phenomena correctly, various extensions of the conventional scattering theory [10] were developed [11] - [16] . These theories usually rely on the assumption that the relaxation times associated with different degrees of freedom (e.g., charge carriers) are much longer than typical time-scales characterizing the dynamics of the device [17] . As a consequence they cannot account for situations where strong correlations lead to fast equilibration processes [18] . Moreover, most of them do not allow to treat non-Markovian effects arising e.g."}

The results show that the polarization degree is generally low for all wavelengths except near perihelion when it increases to about 10%-15% with an angle of ~40\u00b0-50\u00b0 counterclockwise relative to solar north pole. This indicates that the dust particles are aligned perpendicularly to the Sun-comet-observer line. We also find that there exists a wavelength dependence of the polarization degree which decreases as the wavelength becomes longer. These observations suggest that the size distribution of the dust grains has a power law index between -3 and -4.

{"text":"We have carried out an extensive survey for dying radio galaxies at 1.4 GHz using the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA).

We find no evidence for any significant number of such objects within our sample. This is consistent with previous studies which suggest that most radio galaxies die before they can be detected as extended structures on arcminute scales. However we do detect several examples of compact steep spectrum emission associated with previously identified dying radio galaxies. These may represent the final stages of evolution prior to complete cessation of nuclear activity. In addition there appears to be some correlation between the presence of these features and the optical properties of their host galaxies. Finally we present new observations of two well studied dying radio galaxies, 3C31 and NGC315, showing that both continue to evolve over time."}
{"text":"We study the UV behavior of gauged chiral supergravities in six dimensions, focusing on their possible supersymmetric AdS 7 vacua. We show that these theories are not free at high energies but instead have an interacting fixed point with a finite number of degrees of freedom. This is achieved by using the recently developed technique of holographic renormalization to compute the beta functions of the gauge coupling constants as well as those associated with higher-derivative terms in the action. The latter can be used to stabilize the scalar potential against quantum corrections. In particular we find that there exists a large class of models which admit metastable de Sitter solutions. These results provide further evidence for the existence of stable non-supersymmetric AdS 7 vacuua in this context. Introduction: Recently it has been shown [1] that certain classes of N = 1 superconformal field theories (SCFTs) in four dimensions may be realized via compactifications of type IIA string theory on Calabi-Yau threefolds X 3 . It was also found [2] that such constructions generically lead to massive gravitons in five dimensions whose masses scale like M 2 grav \u221d V \u22123 , where V denotes the volume of X 3 . As a result one expects that the effective gravitational constant G 5 will run logarithmically with energy [3] .\nIn [4] it was suggested that this running could be stopped if one considers non-perturbative effects due to Euclidean D3-branes wrapping special Lagrangian cycles L \u2208 H 4 (X 3 ; Z). Indeed, it turns out that the corresponding instanton contributions generate a term proportional to R \u2227 R in the lowenergy effective action [5] . If this term dominates over other contributions then the resulting vacuum solution should correspond to anti-de Sitter space [6] . Moreover, since the instanton contribution scales like e \u22121\/g s , where g s denotes the string coupling constant, one finds that the radius of curvature of the anti-de Sitter space decreases exponentially fast when approaching weak coupling [7, 8] .

We show how this simple geometry can be used to derive a closed-form expression for the fluorescence lifetime of the donor molecule as well as its dependence on the concentration of acceptors. This approach allows us to extract information about the distance distribution between donors and acceptors directly from experimental data without any additional assumptions or fitting parameters. In addition we demonstrate how our results can be applied to study the lateral organization of proteins within biological membranes using single-molecule spectroscopy.

{"text":"We report on the measurement and analysis of diffusion coefficients for probe molecules embedded within polymer solutions using optical techniques.  The experiments were performed with two different types of probes, fluorescently labeled polystyrene spheres (PS) and dye doped poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA).

In addition to measuring the mean square displacement as a function of time we also measure the distribution of displacements over many particles simultaneously.   This allows us to extract information about the underlying dynamics which is not possible by simply looking at the ensemble averaged MSD curve alone.  By fitting our data to an appropriate model we are able to determine the concentration dependence of the diffusion coefficient D0 and the exponent \u03b1 characterizing the power law decay of the probability density function P(\u0394r). Our results show good agreement between theory and experiment when compared against predictions based upon the generalized Langevin equation (GLE).

{"text":"We present the first detection of cosmic rays confined within fossil radio plasma bubbles, using deep Chandra X-ray observations and VLA radio data for Abell 2052 (z = 0.0395). The bubble is located at the center of an elliptical galaxy with a prominent dust lane that extends to its nucleus. We find that the bubble has a radius of ~40 kpc and contains hot gas with T ~ 1 keV. This temperature is significantly lower than expected if the bubble were filled by shock-heated ICM. Instead we argue that the bubble is filled with relativistic particles accelerated by shocks driven into the surrounding medium during the formation of the central galaxy. These particles are responsible for the observed synchrotron emission detected on large scales around the bubble. In addition, we detect diffuse soft X-rays extending beyond the bubble's edge which may be due to thermal conduction or mixing between the bubble and the surrounding ICM."}
{"text":"We present new results on the kinematics and dynamics of spiral arm streaming motions in the nearby grand-design galaxy NGC 5194 (M51). We use high-resolution near-IR integral field spectroscopy obtained with SINFONI at VLT to study the gas velocity fields, line-of-sight velocities, and mass surface density distributions along two different lines of sight through the central region of this interacting system. The main goal is to investigate whether or not there are systematic differences between these two viewing angles that could be related to an underlying gravitational potential perturbation caused by the companion galaxy NGC 5195. Our analysis shows that both sides of the nuclear ring exhibit similar large-scale streaming patterns which can be traced out to distances of about 1 kpc into the disk plane. However, we find significant deviations from circular rotation within the inner 100 pc radius around the nucleus. These non-circular motions appear to be dominated by radial inflow towards the center as well as counter-rotating components perpendicular to the major axis of the galactic bar."}
{"text":"We present an analysis of the kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect (kSZ) due to electrons in our galaxy, using data obtained with the Atacama Cosmology Telescope and the South Pole Telescope. We use two different methods for estimating the kSZ signal; one is based on cross-correlating maps of CMB temperature anisotropy at 150 GHz and 3000 GHz, while the other uses the power spectrum of the CMB temperature fluctuations at 150 GHz. The results are consistent between these two approaches within their respective uncertainties. We find that the amplitude of this signal agrees well with theoretical predictions when we assume a Navarro-Frenk-White profile for dark matter density distribution around galaxies.

{"text":"We consider the problem of estimating the parameters in a generalised autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic (GARCH) model, where we allow the variances to depend on past values and also on future values through an exponential decay function. We show that this leads to a new class of GARCH models which are more flexible than existing ones. The proposed method is applied to stock returns data from the S&P 500 index over the period January 1990-December 2009. Our results suggest that allowing dependence between current and past volatility can lead to better forecasts compared to standard GARCH models. In addition, our approach provides evidence against the hypothesis that there exists any significant relationship between current and past volatilities beyond one month. \nIntroduction\n\nAutoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity Models\nThe Autoregressive Conditional Hetroscedasticity (ARCH) model was introduced by Engle [1] as a way of modelling financial asset return series exhibiting \"volatility clustering\" -the phenomenon whereby large changes tend to be followed by other large changes and small changes tend to be followed  by smaller changes.  This property has been observed empirically across many different markets including foreign exchange rates [2] , interest rates [3] , equities [4] and commodities [5] . \nIn its simplest form, ARCH(1), the conditional variance at time t depends only on the previous value of the squared residuals:\nwhere h_t denotes the conditional variance at time t; z_t = y_t - \\hat{\\mu}_t; y_t is the observation at time t; \\hat{\\mu} is the prediction made using some linear regression model such as a simple OLS or VAR model; and $ \\alpha $ controls how quickly the effect of past shocks decays [6] .\nA number of extensions have since been developed [7, 8] . For example, Bollerslev [9] extended the basic ARCH model to include lagged dependent variables in order to capture persistence in the conditional variance process. He showed that if the lagged dependent variable enters into the mean equation linearly then it will enter into the variance equation exponentially."}

{"text":"We report on the observation of strong electron-phonon interaction (EPI) in heavily boron-doped epitaxial graphene grown on SiC(0001). The EPI is found to be enhanced by more than one order of magnitude compared with that observed for undoped graphene, which can be attributed to the formation of a Dirac point at high doping levels and its associated van Hove singularity near the Fermi level. This finding suggests that the EPI in doped graphene may be tunable over several orders of magnitude through chemical or electrostatic gating. \n \n Graphene has attracted considerable attention because it exhibits unique physical properties such as extremely high carrier mobility1-5 and very large optical nonlinearities6-8. However, these remarkable properties are often accompanied by weak interactions between electrons and phonons9-11, which limit their applications in high-speed electronics12-14 and optoelectronics15-17. In this work we demonstrate that the EPI in heavily boron-doping epitaxial graphene grown by thermal decomposition of SiC18-20 can be significantly enhanced due to the presence of a Dirac point21-23 and its associated van Hov singularity24-26 near the Fermi energy EF. We show that the EPI increases rapidly when the Fermi level crosses the van Hove singularity, resulting in a giant increase in the electron-phonon scattering rate. Our results suggest that the EPI in graphene could be controlled electrically via chemical or electrostatic gated27-30, thereby opening up new avenues towards novel devices based on graphene. \nGraphene is known to have extremely high carrier mobilities1-4 but relatively small electron-phonon couplings5-9. These two competing effects determine the performance of graphene-based electronic and optoelectronic devices10-12. For example, the low EPI leads to slow relaxation rates13-15 and thus limits the operation speed of graphene transistors14-16. On the other hand, the high mobility makes graphene attractive for use in high-speed electronics17-19 and ultrafast photodetectors20. Therefore, there exists great interest in developing methods to enhance the EPI while maintaining the high mobility31"}
{"text":"We present an algorithm for the decomposition of the local stellar kinematics into vector spherical harmonic functions (VSH). The method is applied to simulated data and real observations, where we recover the underlying VSH coefficients with high accuracy. We show that our approach can be used as a powerful tool in galactic dynamics studies by recovering the gravitational potential of the Milky Way's dark matter halo. In addition, it allows us to study the anisotropy of the stellar orbits on different scales. \n \n Keywords: Vector spherical harmonics, Galactic dynamics, Stellar kinematics, Gravitational potentials \n \n 1 Introduction \n \n Spherical Harmonic Analysis has been widely used over many decades to analyse astronomical datasets such as galaxy surveys or star counts. However, this technique cannot easily be extended to deal with non-scalar quantities like velocities or accelerations. This problem was overcome by expanding these quantities onto vector spherical harmonics (VSH) which are defined as tensor products of scalar spherical harmonics [1] . These new basis functions have already found applications in fields ranging from cosmology [2] , solar physics [3] , heliophysics [4] and geophysics [5] .\n \nIn recent years there has been growing interest in using VSHs to model the observed properties of galaxies [6] - [8] . For example, they were recently employed to decompose the line-of-sight component of the stellar kinematics [9] . Here, we extend their use to also include the tangential components of the stellar motions. As a result, we obtain a complete description of the three-dimensional distribution of the stellar kinematics within each spatial bin. Moreover, since the expansion coefficients depend only on angular coordinates, they can be determined independently at every point along the line-of-sight. Therefore, our method does not require any assumptions about the symmetry of the system under investigation. \n2 Vector spherical harmonics"}
{"text":"We present new timing results for the double pulsar system PSRJ0737-3039A\/B, which are used to place tight limits on its age and spin-down luminosity. We find that the system is younger than 1 Myr with an upper limit of 3 Myr at 95% confidence level. The inferred spindown luminosity is lower by more than one order of magnitude compared to previous estimates based on radio observations alone. This discrepancy can be explained if we assume that the observed X-ray flux originates from magnetospheric emission rather than from the cooling neutron star surface as previously thought. Our results also show that the two pulsars have different magnetic field strengths (2.1 x 10^12 G versus 5.6 x 10^11G) but similar characteristic ages (0.4 kyr versus 0.5 kyr). These findings suggest that the second-born pulsar has been recycled during the supernova explosion associated with the birth of the first-born pulsar. \n \n Keywords: Pulsar"}
{"text":"We present the results of our study on gravitational wave (GW) foregrounds for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). We focus on double white dwarfs, which are expected to be one of the most important sources in terms of GW energy density and event rate. In particular we investigate how their properties depend on the initial conditions at formation time as well as on the subsequent evolution driven by nuclear burning and orbital decay due to emission of gravitational waves. The latter is studied with detailed numerical simulations using an updated version of the Eggleton code that includes general relativistic effects. \n \n Our main findings can be summarized as follows: \n \n 1. We find that the number of systems detectable within a given volume depends strongly on the assumed distribution function of binary parameters such as mass ratio q = M2\/M1 or total system mass Mtot = M1 + M2. This dependence arises because different distributions lead to very different fractions of binaries with favorable orientations relative to the detector's line-of-sight. If all binaries have random orientation then only about 10% of them will produce signals above the detection threshold. On the other hand if they form preferentially face-on this fraction increases up to 50%. Therefore it seems crucially important to determine the true distribution functions of these quantities observationally before making any predictions regarding the number of detections. \n \n 2. We show that there exists a strong correlation between the masses of the two components of a double white dwarf binary. As a result, the majority of systems detected by LISA will consist of nearly equal-mass objects. However, even though the average value of q is close to unity, there still exist many systems where the secondary component has significantly lower mass than its companion. These systems may provide valuable information about the physics of stellar mergers since they allow us to probe the regime of low-q binaries not accessible through observations of single degenerate stars."}
{"text":"We study the self-similar evolution of cosmic-ray-modified quasi-parallel plane shocks in an expanding universe with cosmological constant $\\Lambda$ and cold dark matter (CDM).

The solutions are characterized by two parameters: the initial magnetic field strength $B_0$ and the ratio between the Alfven speed and the sound speed $\\alpha = v_{\\text{A}}\/c_s$. For fixed values of $m_{\\text{sh}}$ and $\\alpha$, we show that the downstream temperature $T_{d2}$ decreases as the expansion factor $a(t)$ increases; while the upstream density $n_u$ increases as $a(t)$ decreases.

{"text":"We study the thermal symmetry of the master equation for open quantum systems in terms of its generators and their relations to the entropy production rate.

In particular we find that if the generator is time-reversal invariant then the corresponding steady-state distribution has zero entropy production rate.

{"text":"We report on electrical transport measurements through individual biphenyl dithiol molecules connected to gold electrodes by using scanning tunneling microscopy break-junction technique at room-temperature (RT) and low temperatures down to 4 K. The current\u2013voltage characteristics show clear signatures for molecular conduction, such as Coulomb blockade peaks and negative differential resistance regions. We find that the junction conductance depends strongly on the tilt angle between the molecule backbone and the substrate normal. This is explained by an anisotropic coupling strength between the molecule and the metal contacts which leads to different transmission probabilities along the two main axes of the molecule. In addition we observe a strong temperature dependence of the junction conductance with a maximum around 50 K. These results are discussed within a model based on electron-phonon scattering processes.

However, it was not until the late 1990s when systematic studies were carried out using large samples of objects monitored simultaneously at multiple wavelengths (see e.g., Heeschen et al. 1987; Edelson & Krolik 1988; Hughes et al. 1992; Carini et al. 1993; Wagner et al. 1996) . These investigations revealed that most of these variable sources have flat-spectrum cores which can be identified with quasars and\/or blazars. Furthermore, they showed that the majority of these sources exhibit rapid flares superimposed onto slower trends such as linear increases\/decreases or exponential decays\/flares. This type of behaviour is commonly referred to as \"double-duty cycles\" because the light curves often contain both fast flaring activity and longer term trends (Wagner et al. 1996; . \n \n Since then, numerous multi-wavelength campaigns have been conducted to monitor the flux densities of thousands of AGNs simultaneously across wide frequency ranges (from infrared through optical bands"}
{"text":"The aim of this work is to study the effect of different assembly procedures, as well as different contact laws between particles in powder compaction processes using computer simulations. The results show that the packing density depends strongly on the applied pressure during the assembly process. In addition, it was found that the densification behavior can be influenced by changing the contact law parameters. Finally, we have shown how the microstructure evolves with increasing pressure for two different types of particle contacts. Powder compaction has been studied extensively over many years due to its importance in various industrial applications such as pharmaceutical tablets or metal parts produced via hot pressing techniques [1] . However, despite these efforts there are still open questions regarding the underlying mechanisms governing the densification behavior under external loads [2] .\nIn order to understand the complex phenomena occurring inside compacted materials, several experimental studies were performed [3] , which revealed important information about the evolution of the microstructure [4] . Nevertheless, experiments cannot provide detailed insight into the local interactions taking place at the grain scale [5] . Therefore, numerical methods based on discrete element models (DEM) [6] became an alternative approach to investigate the mechanical properties of granular systems [7, 8] . These DEM-based approaches allow one to track individual grains within large assemblies and thus enable us to obtain valuable insights into the micromechanical response [9] . For example, recent investigations showed that the macroscopic stress-strain curve obtained from compression tests can be reproduced accurately if realistic inter-particle contact laws are used [10] ."}
{"text":"We present new observations of three protostellar cores in Orion B, which are among the youngest known prestellar objects.

We find that all three sources show evidence for infall motions on scales ranging between 1000 AU and 10000 AU. In addition, we detect outflows associated with two of these sources. These results suggest that the first phase of star formation is characterized by rapid mass accretion onto the central object through a circumstellar disk. This process may be triggered by gravitational collapse or magneto-rotational instabilities within the core. Finally, our SMA maps reveal extended emission around each source, which could represent either flattened envelopes or disks surrounding the protostar.

{"text":"We present near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy and photometry for the young open cluster IRAS 18511+0146; we find that it is likely to be an intermediate mass star forming region, with a total luminosity of ~10^6 L_Sun .

The latter group appears to have ages less than 10 Myr based on their H-R diagram positions. This suggests that these are very young objects which may still be embedded within their natal molecular cloud. Using N-body simulations, we show that such clusters can evolve into open clusters like those observed today if they survive disruption by tidal forces during their formation process. In addition, we also estimate the age spread among members of our sample using the equivalent widths of Pa-alpha line profiles as well as the strength of the Brackett gamma line."}

The other is a sample of about 10000 photometrically selected galaxies over an area of ~30deg2 centered on the Hubble Deep Field South (HDF-S).\nThe CMD shows that there are three distinct galaxy populations in terms of their rest-frame colors as well as luminosities. These are: red-sequence early-type galaxies, green valley late-type galaxies, and blue cloud star-forming galaxies. In addition we find that the fraction of blue cloud galaxies increases towards higher redshifts up to z~2.5-3.0, while it decreases again beyond this epoch. This trend can be explained by the fact that most massive galaxies have already formed stars before z~3, so they become redder than less-massive ones afterwards; therefore more massive galaxies dominate the red-sequence population at high-z. On the other hand, less-massive galaxies continue forming stars until today, resulting in larger fractions of blue cloud galaxies at lower redshifts."}
{"text":"The effect of intermolecular interactions on the elastic properties of bottlebrush polymer networks is investigated using molecular dynamics simulations and experimental measurements. The results show that the network becomes softer with increasing density, which can be explained in terms of an increase in the number of entanglements between neighboring chains.

It is found that the simulated stress-strain curves are well described by the Gent model, where the effective spring constant decreases as the density increases. These findings suggest that the mechanical properties of bottlebrush polymer gels can be tuned by changing their density. \n \n Soft materials such as rubbers have been widely used in many applications including tires, seals, adhesives, and biomaterials because they exhibit unique physical characteristics such as high extensibility and low modulus [1\u20133]. In particular, bottlebrush polymers consisting of densely grafted side chains have attracted considerable attention due to their outstanding mechanical properties [4\u20136]. For example, it has recently been reported that bottlebrush poly(ether urethane)s (PEUs), synthesized via ring-opening metathesis polymerization [7, 8], possess higher tensile strength than conventional PEU elastomers [9]. However, despite these advantages, there remain some challenges associated with the use of bottlebrush polymers in practical applications. One of them is how to control the mechanical properties of bottle brushes since the macroscopic properties depend strongly on the microstructure [10, 11]. Therefore, understanding the relationship between structure and property is important for designing new types of bottlebrush-based materials. \nIn this study, we investigate the influence of chain density on the mechanical properties of bottle-brush polyurethanes (BPUs). We find that BPUs become softer when the density increases. To understand this phenomenon, we perform molecular dynamics (MD) simulations based on coarse-grained models [12].

The observed line ratios are consistent with those expected for gas exposed to intense radiation fields characteristic of quasars.

However, CO can be difficult to observe directly because it lacks electric dipole moments and thus emits very weakly. In addition, the excitation temperature of the lowest rotational levels of CO is typically low enough such that these transitions fall outside of the frequency range accessible to ground-based telescopes operating at millimeter wavelengths. As a result, much of our understanding about the physical conditions present in dense regions of star-forming galaxies comes from studies of other tracers of molecular gas, including HCN, H2S, CS, CH3OH, H2O, and OH+."}
{"text":"We present the renormalization group flow equations for quantum gauge fields on curved spacetime, including fermions and scalars as well as their interactions with gravity. We show that these flows are governed by an exact functional differential equation which is derived using the background field method. The solution to this equation yields all possible counterterms needed to render the theory finite at any order in perturbation theory. This result generalizes previous results obtained within the context of flat space-time. In particular we find that the beta functions for the gravitational couplings do not vanish even if one considers only pure Yang-Mills theories without matter fields. Furthermore, our analysis shows that the running of the gravitational coupling constants can be determined completely in terms of the beta functionals associated with the non-gravitational sectors. Finally, we discuss how our formalism may be used to study the effects of radiative corrections on black hole entropy. Introduction: Gauge theories play a central role in modern particle physics. They provide a description of fundamental forces such as electromagnetism or weak nuclear force. However, it has been known since the early days of QED (quantum electrodynamics) that perturbatively quantizing gauge theories leads to ultraviolet divergences. These divergences have to be removed by adding appropriate local counterterms to the classical action. It turns out that there exist infinitely many different ways to add these counterterms so that the resulting effective action remains invariant under the original gauge symmetry transformations. Therefore, the choice of the correct set of counterterms depends crucially on the regularization scheme chosen to regulate the infinities appearing during the calculation of Feynman diagrams. For example, in dimensional regularization [1] , where the number of dimensions is taken to be d = 4 \u2212 2\u03b5 instead of four, the most general form of the counterterm Lagrangian reads [2] \nwhere F \u00b5\u03bd denotes the electromagnetic field strength tensor and D \u00b5 \u2261 \u2202 \u00b5 + ieA \u00b5 . Here e denotes the electric charge while c 1 , c 2 , . . . denote arbitrary coefficients whose values depend on the specific regularization scheme employed."}
{"text":"In this work, we consider the problem of multiuser detection (MUD) for code division multiple access systems with time-varying channels. We propose an algorithm that jointly performs user identification and data detection by using a maximum likelihood criterion. The proposed method is based on the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm which iteratively estimates both the channel coefficients and transmitted symbols. In order to reduce computational complexity, we also develop a low-complexity suboptimal MUD scheme. Numerical results show that our proposed algorithms outperform existing schemes under various scenarios. Index Terms-Data detection, EM algorithm, Multiuser detection, Time varying channels. 1 Introduction Code-division-multiple-access (CDMA) has been widely used as one of the most promising technologies for next-generation wireless communications due to its high spectral efficiency [1] . However, CDMA suffers from severe interference between users caused by multipath propagation [2] , especially when the number of active users increases [3] .\nTo mitigate inter-user interference, multiuser detectors have been developed [4] - [6] . Among them, linear multiuser detectors are attractive because they can be implemented easily at low cost [7] . Unfortunately, these detectors suffer from performance loss compared to optimal multiuser detectors [8] . To improve their performance, nonlinear multiuser detectors such as successive interference cancellation [9] or parallel interference cancellation [10] were introduced. These detectors require accurate knowledge about the received signals [11] . Therefore, blind multiuser detectors [12] - [14] were proposed to estimate unknown parameters without any training sequence [15] . Although blind multiuser detectors do not need prior information about the received signal, they usually perform worse than conventional multiuser detectors [16] .\nRecently, there has been growing interest in developing multiuser detectors for time-varying channels [17] - [20] . Since the channel varies over time, it becomes more difficult to detect the transmitted symbol accurately [21] . Moreover, if the channel changes rapidly, then the detector may fail completely [22] . Thus, it is important to design robust multiuser detectors against rapid channel variations [23] ."}
{"text":"We study the collective modes in two-band superconductors with different gaps and masses, using the random phase approximation (RPA). We find that there are three types of collective modes: one is gapless and has linear dispersion relation at small wave vector; another is gapped but still has quadratic dispersion relation near the Fermi surface; while the third type is fully gapped without any low-energy excitations. The latter two types can be regarded as phonon-like collective modes. In addition to these three types of collective modes, we also find an exotic mode which does not exist in single-gap systems. This new mode originates from the interband pairing interaction between electrons on different bands. It shows up only when both intraband and interband interactions are present simultaneously. Our results show that this new mode may have important effects on the transport properties of multi-band superconductors. \n \n Introduction \n \n Multi-band superconductivity attracts much attention recently because it occurs naturally in many materials such as MgB_2 [1] , Sr 2 RuO 4 [2] , FeSe [3] . These compounds usually contain several orbitals per unit cell so they support multiple electronic bands crossing the Fermi level [4] . Due to the presence of more than one band, the electron-phonon coupling strength could vary significantly among different bands [5] . Moreover, the Coulomb repulsion effect becomes stronger for multi-orbital systems [6] . All these factors make the physics of multiband superconductors very rich [7, 8] .\n \nIn recent years, great progresses have been made in understanding the physical properties of multi-band superconductor [9] . For example, the vortex lattice structure [10] , magnetic field dependence [11] , thermal conductivity [12] , specific heat [13] , NMR relaxation rate [14] etc., were studied extensively by experiments. On the theoretical side, various methods including mean-field theory [15] , Eliashberg formalism [16] , functional renormalization group [17] , variational Monte Carlo [18] , exact diagonalization [19] , density matrix renormalization group [20] , and quantum Monte Carlo [21] were used to investigate the ground state properties [22] , thermodynamic quantities [23] ,"}
{"text":"We study numerically and analytically the dynamics of an elastic interface in two dimensions driven by thermal fluctuations, starting far away from equilibrium. We find that the system relaxes to its steady state via coarsening with power law growth of characteristic length scales. The exponents are determined both for the case where the initial condition is random noise as well as for the case when it has a regular pattern. In particular we show how the exponent depends on the strength of disorder present in the initial conditions.

INTRODUCTORY REMARkS\n\nThe motion of interfaces between different phases or states plays an important role in many physical systems ranging from crystal growth [1] , fluid flow [2] , magnetic domain wall motion [3] , fracture [4] , wetting [5] , etc.. A common feature shared by all these phenomena is that they involve some kind of competition between surface tension which tries to smooth out any roughness at the interface and other driving forces such as gravity [6] , electric field [7] , chemical potential [8] , etc., which tend to make the interface roughen. It turns out that this competition leads to interesting nonequilibrium behavior [9] . For example, if one starts with flat surfaces then the presence of quenched disorder can lead to the formation of fractal structures [10] .\nIn recent years there have been several studies [11] - [16] devoted to understanding the statistical properties of growing interfaces near their critical dimension d c = 2 [17] . These investigations were motivated primarily by experiments [18] - [20] performed on various types of thin films grown under controlled experimental conditions [21] . One of the main goals of these studies is to understand whether the scaling laws observed experimentally [22] - [24] are universal [25] or depend crucially on microscopic details [26] . Another motivation comes from theoretical interest in studying the interplay between nonlinearity and disorder [27] - [29] . Finally, another reason for investigating the problem theoretically is due to possible applications [30] - [32] in data storage devices [33] and optical"}

{"text":"We present an approach to calculate the effective material properties of thin layered structures, which are composed by two or more different materials with periodic microstructure. The method is based on homogenization theory combined with finite element analysis (FEA) in order to account for local interactions between neighboring unit cells. We consider three types of unit cell geometries that can be used to model various composite materials such as: wire grid composites, fiber reinforced polymeric matrix composites, and metal foams. In particular we focus our attention on wire grid composites made up of periodically arranged parallel wires embedded into a homogeneous medium. For this type of structure it has been shown experimentally that the macroscopic elastic moduli depend strongly on the volume fraction occupied by the wires. However, these experimental results cannot be explained using classical homogenization theories because they do not take into account the interaction effects among adjacent wires. Therefore, we propose here a new theoretical framework to study the mechanical behavior of wire grid composites at both micro-and meso-scales."}

{"text":"We study the superfluid phase transition of an imbalanced fermionic gas trapped by a harmonic potential, which is realized experimentally with ultracold atoms near Feshbach resonances. We show that the critical temperature for Cooper pairing depends on the population difference between spin-up and -down particles as well as their interaction strength. In particular, we find that the critical temperature decreases monotonically when increasing the population difference at fixed interaction strengths. This result can be understood intuitively within mean-field theory. However, our numerical results reveal that this monotonic decrease does not hold beyond mean field due to strong quantum fluctuations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the critical temperature increases rapidly around unitarity where the scattering length diverges. Finally, we discuss how these findings are relevant to experiments. The physics of strongly interacting fermions has been studied extensively over past decades both theoretically [1] and experimentally [2] . One important aspect of such systems is the crossover regime from Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) superfluids [3] , where pairs form through weak attractive interactions, to Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), where bosons condense into one single macroscopic wave function [4] .\nIn recent years, there have been many experimental studies on the superfluid properties of cold atomic gases [5] . For example, it was shown [6] that the critical temperature T c for Cooper pairing depends sensitively on the population difference n \u2191 \u2212n \u2193 between spin-up and -spin-down particles [7, 8] . Here, n \u2191(\u2193) (r) denotes the density distribution of spin-up (-down) particles. It was also found [9] that T c changes dramatically across the resonance point where the s-wave scattering length diverges [10] . These observations were explained qualitatively using meanfield theories [11] . However, since the system becomes more correlated close to the resonance [12] , it remains unclear whether or not the above mentioned behaviors persist beyond mean field [13] .\nThe purpose of this Letter is twofold. First, we investigate the dependence of T c on the population difference \u2206n = n \u2191 \u2212 n \u2193 numeric"}

In both cases we found good agreement between numerical results obtained with our new model and experimental data. \n \n Keywords: Antenna design"}
{"text":"We study the dynamics of Lorentzian brane-worlds with time dependent bulk cosmological constant in the context of Randall-Sundrum type II models, where we allow for both positive and negative values of the bulk cosmological constant. We show that there are two branches of solutions corresponding to either an expanding or contracting universe on the brane depending upon whether the bulk cosmological constant is positive or negative respectively. In addition, we find that these solutions can be smoothly connected by a branch of static solutions which correspond to Minkowski space-time on the brane. Finally, we also consider the possibility of having a change of signature across the brane and discuss how this affects our results. The main motivation behind studying braneworld scenarios comes from the fact that they provide us with a natural framework within which one may address some of the fundamental issues related to quantum gravity such as the hierarchy problem [1] . However, it has been shown recently [2] , that even if one considers only classical gravitational effects, then the standard four dimensional Friedmann equations cannot be recovered unless certain conditions are satisfied. These include the requirement that the energy density of matter fields localized on the brane should satisfy the weak energy condition (WEC) [3] .\nIn order to overcome this difficulty, several authors have considered different approaches [4] - [8] . For example, in ref. [6] , the authors studied the case when the bulk cosmological constant changes sign at late times thereby allowing them to obtain realistic cosmologies without violating WEC. On the other hand, in ref. [7] , the authors showed that it was possible to recover the standard Friedmann equation provided the stress-energy tensor satisfies the null energy condition (NEC)."}

Introduction \n \n Memory devices play a crucial role in many modern technologies such as computers, mobile phones, digital cameras etc., but their development has been mainly focused on digital memories due to their higher performance compared to conventional analog ones [1] . However, there exist several important applications where analog memories could provide significant advantages over digital counterparts [2] , e.g. pattern recognition [3] , data compression [4] , image processing [5] , bio-inspired computing [6] .\n \nIn recent years, considerable efforts have been made towards developing new types of analog memories [7, 8] . Among these proposals, spintronic systems [9] offer great potential thanks to their unique properties [10] including non-volatility [11] , fast switching [12] , large integration densities [13] , compatibility with CMOS technology [14] and energy efficiency [15] . These features make spintronic devices promising candidates for future generations of nonvolatile memories [16] . \n \n Herein, we propose a novel concept of an analogue memory based on a magnetic wire network [17] . Our approach relies on the use of a ferrofluid [18] , i.e. colloidal suspension of superparamagnetic nanoparticles [19] , confined between two layers of ferromagnetic nanowires [20] . Due to the presence of the ferrofluid layer, each nanowire acquires a net magnetization [21] .

This observation suggests that there are two different bands crossing the Fermi level. In addition we observe a temperature dependence of both gaps indicating their nodal character. Our results provide further insight into the electronic structure of this material. Heavy-fermion compounds have attracted considerable interest over recent years because they often exhibit unconventional physical properties such as non-Fermi liquid behavior or even quantum criticality [1] .

{"text":"We show that the equivalence principle (EP) is violated in quantum gravity if there are dilatons or axions coupled to photons. The violation can be tested by measuring the polarization rotation angle of light passing through gravitational fields. We find that the EP-violating effect is suppressed for macroscopic distances but enhanced for microscopic ones such as those inside atoms. This suggests that the measurement of atomic clocks may provide an opportunity to test the EP at high precision. \n \n In this work we study how the equivalence principle (EP), which states that all local physical laws should take their same form in any freely falling frame, is modified when one considers quantum gravity effects. It has been shown previously that the EP is violated in general relativity with massive gravitons [1] . Here we consider whether it remains valid in theories beyond Einstein's theory where new degrees of freedom exist. Specifically, we focus on two types of models: scalar-tensor theories [2] , including Brans-Dicke theory [3] , and string-theory inspired models [4] .\n \nIn these theories, dilatons and\/or axions appear as additional degrees of freedom besides graviton(s). Dilatons couple directly to photons while axions do so indirectly via coupling to photons and gluons [5] . These couplings lead to violations of the EP [6] . For example, in scalar-tensor theories, the photon acquires a mass term proportional to the strength of the gravitational field [7, 8] . As a result, the speed of light depends on its direction relative to the gravitational field [9] . If the gravitational field varies along the path of propagation, then the speed of light also changes accordingly [10] . Since different polarizations travel at slightly different speeds, they acquire different phases during propagation [11] . Therefore, the polarization state of light will rotate after traveling through a gravitational potential gradient [12] ."}
{"text":"The following is an excerpt from Ren\u00e9 Decartes' Discourse on Method, Book II (1637): \nI have found by experiment that if I take any right line and divide it into equal parts in such manner as to make one part double another, then the square which shall be formed with these two parts will be equal to the rectangle whose sides are those lines; so that this figure may serve me instead of the square root. \n \n If we suppose that the diameter AB of a circle equals 2, and that the radius AC equals 1, then the area of the circle will be equal to 4 times the square of the radius, or 8 times the square of half its diameter, because the square of twice the diameter is equal to four squares of the same side. The area of the circle therefore being known, it remains only to find how many degrees there are contained within it; but since the circumference of a circle is always equal to three times the diameter, it follows that the number of degrees contained therein must also be 3 times the number of degrees contained between the diameter and the center of the circle."}

As a result, only about 100 Galactic RSGs are known today compared to thousands of OB stars. To date, most studies on extragalactic RSGs have focused on the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), where several hundred RSGs have been identified using optical color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs). However, this method cannot identify RSGs fainter than V = 16 mag or more obscured by interstellar extinction. Therefore, many faint and\/or heavily extincted RSGs remain undiscovered even in the LMC. Recently, Massey et al. (2006a) discovered two extremely bright RSGs in the Small Magellanics Cloud (SMC) based on infrared (IR) CMDs constructed from 2MASS data. They suggested that such bright RSGs could also exist in other nearby dwarf irregular galaxies like NGC"}
{"text":"We present the results of hydrodynamic simulations that show how planets open gaps in circumstellar disks and determine their minimum mass for gap opening as a function of disk viscosity, surface density profile slope, and irradiation by the central star.  We find that the planet's ability to open a gap is determined primarily by its accretion rate onto the planet (which depends on the planet's mass) rather than by its luminosity or temperature. The critical planet mass decreases with increasing disk viscosity because higher viscosities lead to more rapid angular momentum transport across the planet's orbit which reduces the planet's ability to accrete gas. For fixed viscosity, we find that the critical planet mass increases with decreasing surface density power law index because lower values of this parameter correspond to steeper radial profiles of the disk's surface density which leads to stronger gravitational torques exerted by the planet. Finally, we find that the planet's critical mass decreases with increasing stellar irradiation due to increased temperatures at small radii where most of the torque is generated."}

{"text":"We present the results of our numerical simulations on planet formation around binary stars with different mass ratios and orbital configurations, focusing on how planets are formed under such conditions. We find that terrestrial planets can form in wide binaries (separation larger than 100 AU) as well as close binaries (separation smaller than 10 AU). The final number of terrestrial planets depends strongly on the initial disk structure and the total amount of solids available for accretion. In most cases we found only one or two terrestrial planets forming within 1 AU. However, if there is enough material to build up massive cores at large distances from their host star(s), then multiple terrestrial planets may be able to form near each other. If the separation between the components of the binary system is less than about 20 AU, then it becomes difficult for any planetary core to grow beyond Mars size before being disrupted by tidal forces due to its proximity to the secondary component."}
{"text":"We have investigated whether pulsar timing observations can be used to detect gravitational waves by observing the Shapiro effect, which is caused by the passage of gravitational waves through space-time around the Earth and its companion star (the Sun). We find that this method will not work with current technology because it requires very accurate measurements of pulse arrival times over many years. However, we show how future radio telescopes could make such measurements if they are equipped with new technologies like phased-array feeds or digital backends. In addition, we discuss other possible methods using pulsar timing data to search for gravitational waves. Gravitational waves cause time delays between pulses emitted at different points on the surface of a rotating neutron star. These time delays depend on the distance between these points as well as their position relative to the line-of-sight towards the observer. The most prominent effects occur when the wave passes close to the Earth and its companion stars. This causes an additional delay known as the Shapiro effect [Shapiro 1964] . If one knows the positions of all pulsars within a globular cluster, then one can use the observed pulse arrival times to measure the distances between them. By comparing these measured distances with those predicted by general relativity, one can test whether Einstein's theory correctly describes gravity on large scales."}

Our selection is based on the detection significance of overdensities in color-color space as well as their luminosity function. In addition we require that all candidates are detected in X-rays. This yields a total number of 1253 candidate galaxy clusters between z=0.3 and 0.9.

{"text":"We present an analysis of the probability that supernovae enrich protoplanetary disks with heavy elements, and discuss its implications for planet formation theory. We find that this process is likely to occur in most cases where stars are formed within clusters containing massive stars (>8 Msun). In these environments, we estimate that about half of all solar-type stars will be enriched by at least one supernova event during their disk lifetimes. This result has important consequences on our understanding of how planets form around metal-rich stars. The discovery of extrasolar giant planets orbiting metal-rich stars suggests that planet formation may be more efficient when the host star's metallicity is high. However, it remains unclear whether such planets can also form around low-mass stars like the Sun. Recent theoretical studies suggest that planetesimal accretion onto growing planetary embryos could be inhibited if the gas surrounding them contains too much dust or ice particles produced by collisions between larger bodies. If so, then the efficiency of core growth would decrease as the amount of solids increases beyond some critical value."}

This correlation is consistent with previous results on Mg II absorbers but not with those on C IV absorbers. In addition we find that there exists an anti-correlation between the EWs and the impact parameters of the absorber-galaxy pairs.

{"text":"We present cosmological hydrodynamic simulations that follow the formation of galaxy clusters in the preheating scenario, where gas is heated by an early generation of stars before it collapses into dark matter haloes. We compare our results with observations of X-ray luminosity-temperature relations (L-T) at z = 0 as well as temperature profiles out to large radii. Our simulated L-T relation agrees very well with observational data over three orders of magnitude in luminosity. The slope of the observed L-T relation steepens towards lower temperatures while we find no such trend in our simulation. This discrepancy may be due to additional heating mechanisms not included in our model or due to systematic uncertainties in the observational sample. In addition, we show that the entropy profile of our simulated cluster population can reproduce the shape of observed profiles within their scatter. However, there are significant differences between individual simulated clusters and real systems which could be caused by non-gravitational processes like AGN feedback."}

{"text":"We present new observations of the neutral hydrogen (HI) in four nearby early-type galaxies, NGC 4261, NGC 4550, NGC 4621, and NGC 5866, which show signs of having undergone recent episodes of star formation. The data were obtained using the Very Large Array at 1.4 GHz as part of our ongoing survey for HI-rich galaxies. We find that all four galaxies have large amounts of atomic gas associated with them. In particular, we detect an extended component of HI emission around each galaxy, extending out to several kiloparsecs beyond their optical disks. This is consistent with previous studies showing that many early-type galaxies contain significant reservoirs of cold gas outside their stellar bodies. \n \n These results are discussed within the context of current models of galaxy evolution. It has been suggested that some fraction of this gas may be accreted by the host galaxy through interactions or mergers with other systems.

{"text":"We present an analytic solution to the steady state distribution for the mechanistic home-range model developed by Moorcroft et al. (2006) that allows for efficient computation of home ranges using numerical integration methods. The new method is implemented as part of the R package adehabitatHR, which also includes functions for computing home ranges with the original algorithm (i.e., without the analytical solution). We demonstrate how our approach can be used to rapidly compute home ranges across large landscapes containing thousands of habitat patches. Our results show that the new method produces identical estimates compared to those obtained with the original algorithm but requires less computational time when estimating home ranges over large spatial extents. Analytical solutions are useful because they allow researchers to efficiently estimate home ranges on very large datasets or at fine resolutions. \n \n Home ranges have been widely studied since their introduction into ecology more than 50 years ago [1] . These areas represent the area within which individuals obtain all necessary resources [2] , such as food [3] , water [4] , shelter [5] , mates [6] , and cover [7] . In addition to being important for understanding animal behavior [8] , home ranges play key roles in conservation biology [9] , wildlife management [10] , epidemiology [11] , and disease transmission [12] .\n \nHome-range models typically assume that animals move through a landscape composed of discrete habitat patches [13] . Animals select among these patches based on some combination of patch attributes [14] , including resource availability [15] , vegetation structure [16] , predation risk [17] , and conspecific density [18] . This process continues until the animal reaches equilibrium between its movement rate and the quality of available habitats [19] . \n \n A number of different approaches exist for modeling animal movements [20] .

We also show how this result can be used to solve a certain Gel'fand-Kirilov problem on such algebras. The results are obtained by combining techniques developed in our previous papers [FV] , [K1] - [K3] . \nIntroduction.\nIn his famous book [Dix] , Dixmier introduced the notion of a regular representation of a commutative Banach *-algebra A as a continuous linear map \u03c0:A\u2192B(H), where H is some Hilbert space (the carrier space); he showed that every such representation arises uniquely from a positive functional f:A\u2192C via the formula \u03c0(a)f=af(\u03c0). In particular, if f is faithful then so is \u03c0. This led him to define the concept of a C*-algebra as a norm closed subalgebra of B(H) (or equivalently, as a unital Banach *-algebra whose only bounded approximate identity consists of projections).\nThe main goal of this work is to extend these ideas to the setting of noncommutative rings. More precisely, we will consider two classes of objects which generalize both commutative Banach *-algebras and their representations. \nFirst, let R be any ring.

{"text":"We study the slow wave resonance (SWR) effect for periodically layered media with an arbitrary number N of anisotropic layers, each characterized by its own permittivity tensor and thickness. We show that SWR is possible only if all principal axes of the permittivity tensors are parallel to one another within each layer. In this case we derive explicit expressions for the dispersion relation between the frequency f and the Bloch wavenumber kx. The results obtained can be used as guidelines for designing multilayered structures exhibiting strong SWR effects at low frequencies. \n \n Keywords: Slow wave resonance; Anisotropy; Multilayer structure; Dispersion relations. 1 Introduction \n \n Periodic multilayers consisting of alternating thin films made of different materials have attracted considerable attention during recent years due to their unique properties [1] . These include high reflectance [2] , negative refraction [3] , enhanced nonlinear optical response [4] , etc., which make them promising candidates for various applications such as optoelectronic devices [5] or photovoltaics [6] .\n \nIn particular, it has been shown recently [7\u20139] that periodic multilayers composed of anisotropic layers may exhibit very interesting electromagnetic phenomena including slow wave resonance (S WR). This phenomenon occurs when the phase velocity of the Bloch waves becomes equal to zero inside the medium [10] . It leads to extremely large values of the effective refractive index n eff = c \/ v ph [11] where c is the speed of light in vacuum and v ph is the phase velocity of the propagating Bloch mode [12] . As a result, the corresponding transmission spectrum exhibits sharp peaks associated with narrow stop bands [13] . Such features are highly desirable for many practical applications [14] . \n \n However, despite numerous theoretical studies devoted to S WR in periodic multilayers [15\u201318] , there still exist several open questions related to the conditions under which this phenomenon takes place [19, 20] .

{"text":"We present an experimental method for measuring the slip length in Newtonian fluids at low Reynolds number by means of a torsional ultrasonic oscillator (TUSO). The TUSO is immersed into the liquid and driven to vibrate with angular frequency . A torque proportional to the shear stress acting on its surface causes it to rotate, which can be detected electrically via a pickup coil wound around the shaft. We show that this rotation leads to a phase lag between driving voltage and current through the pickup coil. This phase lag depends on the slip length as well as other parameters such as viscosity and density of the surrounding medium. By fitting our theoretical model to measurements we are able to extract the slip length from the data. Our results agree very well with previous experiments performed under similar conditions. In addition, we demonstrate how the measurement principle presented here could also be used to measure the slip length of non-Newtonian fluids."}
{"text":"We present the results of an investigation into the properties of the two-loop vacuum polarization tensor in QED, using dimensional regularization with minimal subtraction (MS).

We find that these HVSs are consistent with being ejected from the Galactic center along orbits which have been perturbed by encounters with massive black holes at intermediate distances and possibly also by other mechanisms such as gravitational scattering off molecular clouds or globular clusters. The observed velocities of the HVSs can be reproduced if they were ejected between 0.5 and 1 Gyr ago on nearly radial orbits with eccentricities ranging from 0 to 0.9. This is consistent with theoretical predictions for the time scale over which dynamical friction causes the orbital decay of massive objects into the central regions of galaxies. \n \n Keywords: High-velocity star, Black hole, Galaxy evolution, Ejection mechanism, Dynamical friction, Halo shape \n \n Introduction \n \n Hypervelocity stars (HVSs; Brown et al., 2007a; Kenyon et al., 2008 ) are defined as those having space velocities exceeding 500 km\/s relative to their local standard of rest.

In addition, it was suggested recently that some HVSs could be produced via the interaction of a single star with a supermassive black hole (SMBH) located outside the GC (Yu & Madau 2007; Sesana et al. 2007 ) .

In the second method we fit modified blackbody functions to each galaxy's SEDs individually and then integrate over all wavelengths longer than 100 microns to determine their total dust masses. For both methods we assume that the dust is optically thin throughout our wavelength range.  Using the derived dust masses and gas masses determined by previous studies we find that there are no significant differences in the dust-to-gas ratio as a function of IR luminosity or morphological type within this sample."}
{"text":"We have studied the minimal size of a barchan by means of numerical simulations and found that it is determined by the balance between the sand flux at its crest, which decreases with decreasing height, and the wind shear stress over the slip face, which increases with decreasing height.  We show that this leads to an optimal height for the barchan dunes in agreement with observations. The results are presented below. \nThe authors thank Jens Egeberg Hansen (University of Southern Denmark) for useful discussions. Sand transport occurs when grains are lifted up into the air due to aerodynamic forces exerted by the wind. This process can be described as saltation [1] , where individual particles jump across the surface before being deposited again. Saltating particles transfer momentum to the surrounding fluid through collisions [2] . In turn, these collisions generate turbulence [3] .\nSaltation also causes erosion [4] and deposition [5] . Erosion takes place if the net force acting on a grain is directed away from the ground [6] . Deposition happens if the net force acts towards the ground [7, 8] . These processes lead to the formation of bedforms such as ripples [9] or dunes [10] . Dunes are formed under conditions where the sediment supply exceeds the rate of removal [11] . They occur naturally [12] but they may also form artificially [13] . Barchan dunes are crescent-shaped structures [14] .

{"text":"We report on the optical investigation of single self-assembled InAs\/GaAs quantum dots (QDs) in an external magnetic field applied along their growth direction. The QD emission line splits into two components with opposite circular polarization when the magnetic field is increased to about 1 T, which corresponds to the Zeeman splitting energy of 0.5 meV at 4 K. We observe that this splitting increases linearly as temperature decreases down to 20 mK and then saturates below 10 mK. This behavior can be explained by taking into account both electron-hole exchange interaction and phonon-assisted relaxation processes between different excitonic states within QDs. Our results show that the spin-flip time for electrons confined inside QDs is longer than 100 ns even under high magnetic fields up to 5 T. Quantum dot (QD), also known as semiconductor nanocrystal or artificial atom, has attracted much attention due to its unique physical properties such as size-tunable band gap [1] , strong confinement effect [2] , and large oscillator strength [3] . These features make it possible to use QDs as building blocks for various optoelectronic devices including light-emitting diodes [4] , lasers [5] , solar cells [6] , photodetectors [7] , and so forth [8] .\nIn recent years, there have been many efforts devoted to investigating the spin dynamics of carriers confined in QDs [9] - [11] . It was found that the carrier spins are very stable against decoherence caused by environmental noise [12] - [14] . However, the spin flip times were reported to vary widely depending on experimental conditions [15] - [17] . For example, the spin lifetimes of holes [18] and electrons [19] confined in QDs were measured to be several nanoseconds using pulsed excitation techniques.

{"text":"We present an algorithm for checking consistency in quantified constraints, which is based on the concept of generalized quantifiers. We show that our approach can be used to check several constraint properties such as satisfiability or equivalence between two sets of quantified constraints. Finally we discuss how this method could be applied to solve problems related to software testing. In computer science, many problems are formulated using constraints. For example, in Software Testing (ST), test cases are often represented by means of logical formulas called Test Cases Specifications (TCS). These TCSs contain some variables whose values have to satisfy certain conditions expressed with Boolean expressions. The problem consists then in finding all possible assignments of these variables satisfying the given conditions. This kind of problems has been studied extensively during last years but most works focus only on unquantified constraints. However, there exist situations where it may be useful to express some restrictions over the set of solutions using quantifiers."}
{"text":"We study the relationship between the geometry of quantum states in Hilbert space and their representation as probability distributions on phase spaces. We show that for any state $\\rho$ there is an associated convex body $K$ such that the expectation value of any observable $A$ can be written as the integral over $K$ with respect to some measure $\\nu_A$. The volume of this body gives rise to a new entropy-like quantity which we call the \"quantum R\u00e9nyi entropy\" $R(\\rho)$. This quantity has been studied previously by several authors but its connection to the geometry of quantum states was not understood until now. In particular, we prove that $R(\\rho) = -\\log \\det \\rho$ if and only if $\\rho$ is pure.

It is usually formulated in terms of the statistical properties of ensembles of identically prepared systems. However, in many cases these ensembles are too large or difficult to prepare experimentally so that individual realizations become more relevant than ensemble averages. For example, in atomic and nuclear physics experiments single particles are often detected individually rather than being averaged out into an ensemble average. Similarly, in optical experiments photons are counted individually instead of being integrated over time intervals. These examples motivate the formulation of alternative approaches to describing the statistics of measurement results based on the description of individual experimental runs.\n\nIn recent years considerable progress has been made towards understanding the statistical properties of individual quantum mechanical systems using concepts borrowed from information theory [1] . One important result in this direction is the Holevo bound [2] , which provides upper bounds on the amount of classical information extractable about a quantum system described by a density matrix $\\rho$ when performing measurements on a finite number of copies"}
{"text":"We present the results of a numerical study on the relaxation dynamics of an initially straight contact line in a two-dimensional geometry, which is driven by surface tension and viscous dissipation at the moving interface between liquid and gas phases.  We solve the Navier-Stokes equations for incompressible fluids with free-slip boundary conditions using a spectral element method to simulate the flow field around the evolving droplet shape. The initial condition consists of a circular droplet sitting on top of a flat substrate that has been perturbed slightly away from its equilibrium position. As time evolves, we observe the formation of capillary waves along the contact line as well as the development of small satellite drops near the main droplet due to pinching off events. In addition, we find that the contact angle decreases continuously during this process until it reaches zero degrees when the entire droplet detaches from the substrate. Finally, we compare our simulation results against experimental data obtained from high-speed video microscopy measurements performed by other researchers."}
{"text":"The present article is devoted to the problem whether quantum mechanics can be considered as a macroscopic realist theory or not. The main idea consists in considering the state vector $\\psi$ and its evolution operator $U(t)$, which are basic elements of any quantum mechanical description, as classical quantities with respect to some hidden variables. In this way we obtain an extended version of standard quantum mechanics (SQM), called here generalized quantum mechanics (GQM). We show that GQM reproduces all predictions of SQM for experiments performed on microsystems. However, it leads to different results when applied to macroscopic systems. This fact allows us to conclude that GQM cannot be considered as a macroscopically realistic theory. Finally, we discuss possible consequences of our approach. It has been shown recently [1] , that there exists no local realistic model for quantum mechanics [2] . On the other hand, Bell's theorem [3] shows that quantum mechanics does not admit nonlocal realistic models either [4] . Thus, one may ask if quantum mechanics admits at least some kind of realistic description [5] .\nIn order to answer this question let us consider the following situation [6] : Let $|\\psi\\rangle$ denote the state vector describing the system under consideration. Then, according to Schr\u00f6dinger equation [7] \n$$i\\hbar\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\psi=H\\psi\\tag{1}$$\nthe time-evolution of $|\\psi\\rangle$ is given by\n$$|\\psi(t)\\rangle=i\\hbar\\frac{d}{dt}e^{-iHt\/\\hbar}|\\psi(0)\\rangle\\tag{2}$$\nwhere $H$ denotes the hamiltonian [8] . Now suppose that $|\\psi\\rangle$ describes a microsystem consisting of N particles [9] . Then, since the number $N$ of particles involved in such a system is very large [10] , the state vector $|\\psi\\rangle$ will have a huge dimension [11] . Therefore, it seems reasonable to assume [12] that $|\\psi\\rangle=\\bigoplus_{i=1}^{N}\\psi_i$ where each component $\\psi_i$ corresponds to only one particle [13] ."}
{"text":"We present high-order coupled cluster (CC) results for the ground state energy and magnetic susceptibility of several one-dimensional spin-1\/2 Heisenberg models with nearest-neighbor interactions, including the isotropic chain, the anisotropic XXZ model, and the two-leg ladder system. We show that CC provides accurate results even at low temperatures where standard mean-field approaches fail to describe correctly the physics of these systems. In particular we find that the magnetization curve of the isotropic chain displays an unexpected non-monotonic behavior which can be explained by the presence of two competing phases characterized by different values of the staggered magnetization. Finally, we discuss how our results could be used as benchmark data for future numerical studies on more complicated two-dimensional or three-dimensional quantum magnets. The study of strongly correlated electron systems has been a central topic in condensed matter theory over many decades [1] . One important class of such materials are so-called quantum magnets [2] , i.e., compounds whose low-energy excitations are described by collective spin degrees of freedom. These systems have attracted considerable interest because they often display exotic phenomena like unconventional superconductivity [3] , fractionalized excitations [4] , or topological order [5] .\nIn recent years there has also been growing interest in studying artificially engineered quantum magnets [6] using ultracold atoms [7] or trapped ions [8] . This new field of research offers unprecedented possibilities to explore novel physical regimes [9] and it may lead to the development of new technologies [10] . However, despite their fundamental importance, theoretical investigations into quantum magnets remain challenging due to the strong correlations between the spins [11] . Therefore, finding reliable methods to calculate properties of these systems remains an active area of research [12] .\nOne particularly interesting example of a quantum magnet is given by the one-dimensional (1D) Heisenberg model [13] \nwhere J > 0 denotes the strength of the exchange interaction between neighboring sites j = 1, ..., L along the chain direction x, while S j \u2261 c \u2020 j \u03c3c j describes the local spin operator acting on site j with Pauli matrices {\u03c3}.

{"text":"We present new experimental results on the relaxation dynamics of a liquid film that is pulled off an inclined solid substrate by gravity and capillarity. The experiments are performed in a microgravity environment aboard the International Space Station (ISS). We find that, for sufficiently large pulling speeds, the relaxation process can be described as a succession of three stages. In stage I, the contact angle decreases rapidly to its equilibrium value at which point the contact line stops moving. Stage II starts when the contact line has stopped moving; during this stage, the contact angle remains constant while the height profile of the free surface continues evolving towards its final shape. Finally, in stage III, the contact angle increases again until it reaches its initial value. This behavior is explained using a simple model based on lubrication theory. Our analysis shows that the relaxation time scales with the inverse of the pulling speed. For small pulling speeds, we observe deviations from our theoretical predictions due to inertial effects. \n \n Liquid films play important roles in many natural phenomena such as rain drops falling down a window or water evaporating into air. Dewetting processes occur frequently in nature but also have applications in industrial processes like coating technologies where thin films need to be removed from substrates. Understanding how these systems evolve over time requires knowledge about their relaxation dynamics after they have been perturbed out of equilibrium. Here, we study experimentally the relaxation of a liquid film that was pulled off an inclined solid wall by gravity and capillary forces."}
{"text":"We propose an experimental scheme for generating graph states using the quantum Ising model in transverse magnetic field and its generalization to higher dimensions, which is realized by coupling spins via two-mode squeezed vacuum fields. We show that this method can be used to generate arbitrary graph states on one-dimensional (1D) chain as well as two-dimensional square lattice. In particular, we demonstrate how to prepare 1D cluster states and 2D cluster-dot states. The proposed scheme has several advantages over previous proposals such as high fidelity, scalability, and flexibility. It also provides a new way to study many-body physics beyond the standard paradigm based on fermions or bosons. Graph states are useful resources for various applications including measurement-based quantum computation [1] , quantum communication [2] , and quantum metrology [3] . They have been generated experimentally [4] - [8] .\nIn recent years there has been considerable interest in developing schemes for preparing graph states [9] - [17] . Most existing methods require either sophisticated optical elements [10] - [12] or complicated interactions between atoms [13] - [15] . Recently, it was shown that graph states could be prepared efficiently using only linear optics [16] - [18] . However, these approaches suffer from low efficiency due to photon loss during transmission through optical fibers [19] . Alternatively, graph states may be produced deterministically using trapped ions [20] - [22] . This approach requires precise control of ion-ion interaction strength and suffers from limited scalability [23] ."}
{"text":"We present an alternative approach to reconstructing the scalar-field Lagrangian in scalar-tensor theories, based on the assumption that the background cosmology is described by standard \u039bCDM (Lambda Cold Dark Matter) model with negligible tensor perturbations. We show how this method can be used to derive constraints on the parameters of the theory using current data sets such as WMAP7+BAO+H0. The resulting parameter space for some representative models are shown to agree well with those obtained previously through other methods. \n \n In particular we consider two classes of models - quintessence-like models where the field potential has a minimum at finite value of the field, and k-essence-like models which have no minima but instead feature a kinetic term with non-canonical dependence on the field velocity. For both cases we find that the allowed range of values for the coupling constant between matter and the scalar field agrees very well with previous results derived from different approaches."}
{"text":"We report on the first simultaneous observations with XMM-Newton and Spitzer Space Telescope (SST) during an active state of the Galactic black hole candidate GRS 1915+105, which is known to show strong variability at all wavelengths. We find that there are two parallel tracks in the evolution of the source's luminosity between the near-infrared (NIR), optical\/UV, soft\/hard X-ray bands as well as radio wavebands. The NIR-optical track follows closely the hard X-ray light curve but lags behind by about 20 days; while the UV-X-ray track shows no lag compared to the hard X-ray light curve. This suggests that different physical processes may be responsible for these two tracks. In addition, we also found evidence for a hysteresis effect in both tracks. These results provide new insights into the physics of accretion flows onto supermassive black holes."}
{"text":"We present an analysis of the X-ray properties of a sample of 12 hyper-luminous infrared galaxies (HLIRGs) observed with XMM-Newton, using data obtained in AO-1 and AO-2. The HLIRG sample is selected to have L(8-1000um)>10^12L_sun , where L(8-1000um), is derived by integrating over the best-fit SEDs for each source. We find that all sources are detected at >5 sigma significance in the 0.3-10 keV band; however only two objects show evidence for significant absorption above Galactic levels. For these two absorbed systems we derive column densities NH = 1.7 x 10^23 cm^{-2} and 2.1 x 10^22 cm^{-2} respectively. Using the hardness ratio HR=H-S\/H+S, where H and S represent counts in the 3-7keV and 0.3-2keV bands respectively, we find no correlation between HR and either luminosity or redshift. This suggests that there may be little evolution in the intrinsic spectral shape of this population out to z=2.6."}
{"text":"We propose DNA hash pooling (DHP) as an efficient data structure for storing large volumes of biological sequences in compressed form, with applications to sequence alignment, database search, and genome assembly. DHP is based on the concept that similar sequences have common substrings which can be represented by short binary codes called hashes. The main idea behind our approach is to store all possible hashes instead of storing each individual sequence separately. We show how this method can be used to compress large collections of biological sequences into small files while still allowing fast searches using standard string matching algorithms such as Boyer-Moore-Horspool or Rabin-Karp. In addition we present several novel applications of DHP including a new algorithm for finding exact matches between two sets of sequences without any prior knowledge about their lengths. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of DHP through experiments conducted on real-world datasets containing millions of human genomes."}
{"text":"We introduce the notion of superconformal nets, which are generalizations of conformal nets in two directions.  First we allow for infinite-dimensional representations (in contrast to finite-dimensional ones). Second, instead of considering only one fixed representation category Rep(N) associated with an object $N$ in some tensor C*-category $\\mathcal{C}$ as is done in the case of ordinary conformal nets, we consider all possible categories Rep(N), where N runs through all objects in $\\mathcal{C}$. \nThe main result of this thesis is that every superconformal net can be classified by its so-called fusion rules. These are certain data describing how the different categories Rep(N) fit together into a larger structure called a tensor C*-category. The classification theorem states that any two superconformal nets having isomorphic fusion rules give rise to equivalent von Neumann algebras. This means that they have the same spectrum of normal operators on their Hilbert spaces."}
{"text":"We present a logic for reasoning about reachability properties on linked data structures, which are graphs with labeled nodes and edges that can be traversed using the Web Linking Language (WLL). The WLL is an extension to RDFS that allows one to specify how links between resources should be created or modified by applications. We show how our logic can be used to express important classes of queries over linked data such as finding all paths between two given nodes, computing the distance between them, checking whether there exists at least one path between them, etc., and we prove its decidability. Finally, we provide algorithms for evaluating these queries under certain restrictions. Our results have been implemented within the LOD2 system.

{"text":"We present new evidence that jets contribute significantly to the observed infrared and optical emission in some neutron star X-ray binary systems, based on simultaneous multiwavelength observations with Swift\/XRT (0.3-10 keV), Chandra\/ACIS-S\/HRC-I (0.5-8 keV) and Spitzer\/IRAC (3.6-24 microns). We find that the spectral energy distribution is well described by an absorbed power law plus blackbody model over this broad range of wavelengths. The best-fit parameters are consistent with those found previously at higher energies using RXTE data alone. \n \n In addition we detect significant variability between epochs separated by months or years. This suggests that there may be multiple components contributing to the overall spectrum; one component which varies rapidly but only weakly contributes to the total flux density, while another component dominates the luminosity output and shows little variation. These results provide further support for models where relativistic outflows play an important role in shaping the evolution of these sources."}
{"text":"We present results on semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering (SIDIS), ep -> e' p X , with an emphasis on final state interaction effects for both proton and neutron targets. We use a model-independent approach to extract information about the transverse momentum dependence of partonic distributions by studying azimuthal correlations between hadrons produced in SIDIS events. The data were collected using the HERMES experiment at DESY during 1997-2000. Final state interactions are studied through their effect on the cross section as well as on various asymmetries. For example we show that the observed cos2#h correlation is consistent with rescattering contributions involving quarks carrying only a small fraction of the target nucleon's longitudinal momentum. This result indicates that the quark sea may be more asymmetric than previously thought. Furthermore, our analysis shows that the magnitude of the rescattering contribution depends strongly on the kinematics chosen. Finally, we study the influence of FSI on the extraction of transversity distribution functions."}
{"text":"We study the gravitational field generated by a massive scalar point source moving on an equatorial circular geodesic around a Schwarzschild black hole, and we evolve it numerically in two spatial dimensions (2+1) with the puncture method. We find that the perturbation is dominated by a single mode which grows exponentially as time goes on. The growth rate agrees well with the prediction based on quasinormal modes for this system. This result suggests that the exponential growth may be related to the instability of the scalar field near the horizon. In addition, we also show that the amplitude of the growing mode decreases rapidly when the mass of the scalar field increases. Finally, we discuss possible applications of our results to astrophysical phenomena such as gamma-ray bursts. \n \n Introduction \n \n Black holes are among the most fascinating objects predicted by general relativity. They have been studied extensively both theoretically and observationally over many decades [1] . One important aspect of their physics concerns how particles move close to them [2] , especially those that can escape from the black hole's gravity [3] . It has recently become clear that there exist some interesting physical processes taking place very close to the event horizon [4] - [6] . For example, if one considers a charged particle falling into a Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black hole, then its motion will be unstable due to the so-called \"photon sphere effect\" [7, 8] . If the charge of the particle is sufficiently large, then the particle will eventually fall into the black hole after emitting photons [9] . Another interesting phenomenon occurs when a neutral particle falls into a Kerr black hole [10] . Here again, the motion becomes unstable because of the existence of the photon sphere [11] . However, unlike the case of a Reissner-Norstr\u00f6m black hole, the emitted radiation now contains not only photons but also gravitons [12] . \n \n In recent years, much attention has been paid to studying the dynamics of fields outside black holes [13] - [17] . In particular, the problem of finding the spectrum of quasi-normal modes (QNMs), i.e., the characteristic frequencies at"}
{"text":"We present results for MHD simulations of the magneto-rotational instability (MRI) in a stratified, Keplerian disk threaded by an initially vertical magnetic field using the ZEUS-2D code. We consider both isothermal and adiabatic equations of state to examine how the MRI depends on the thermodynamics of the gas. In all cases we find that the growth rate of the fastest growing mode agrees well with linear theory predictions when normalized appropriately. However, there are significant differences between our runs depending upon whether or not they have reached steady-state equilibrium. For example, the saturated level of stress achieved at late times varies significantly among different models. This suggests that it may be difficult to accurately predict the saturation amplitude of the MRI unless one can perform very high resolution calculations which evolve over many orbital periods. Finally, we show that the inclusion of radiative cooling has little effect on the properties of the turbulence generated by the MRI."}
{"text":"We present results from three-dimensional MHD simulations of the magneto-rotational instability (MRI) in a stratified, differentially rotating disk threaded by an initially vertical magnetic field and driven by shear viscosity and resistivity. We consider two models for the turbulent stress tensor that are commonly used to model MRI-driven turbulence in accretion disks: one based on phenomenological arguments and another derived from first principles using second-order perturbation theory. In both cases we find that the resulting stresses can be well approximated as proportional to the local pressure P , but with different numerical prefactors. For our fiducial case where the initial plasma beta is equal to 100, we find that the phenomenological prescription gives rise to stresses that are about twice those predicted by the perturbative approach. This difference arises because the former assumes that the Reynolds number Re = vL\/\u03bd is large enough so that nonlinear effects become important before the flow becomes unstable; this assumption breaks down when Re < O(100)."}
{"text":"We present an extensive study on the mode stability properties of delta Scuti (\u03b4 Sct) pulsators, based on both theoretical and observational results obtained for open clusters with ages between 1 Myr and 2 Gyr. We have performed detailed non-radial stellar oscillation calculations using state-of-the-art evolutionary models that include overshooting at convective boundaries as well as microscopic diffusion processes. The main goal is to investigate how the observed frequency pattern changes during evolution due to the effects of rotation-induced mixing and chemical composition gradients. In particular we focus our attention on the so-called mixed modes which are trapped in the region where the hydrogen burning shell overlaps with the helium core. These modes show very characteristic features such as large amplitudes and high degree of nonlinearity. Our results indicate that these modes can be excited by turbulent pressure fluctuations associated with the convection zone located near the surface layers of the star. Moreover, they also suggest that the excitation mechanism may change significantly when the star evolves off the ZAMS towards higher luminosities."}
{"text":"We study the impact of cosmic rays (CRs) on population iii star formation in minihalos, using cosmological hydrodynamic simulations with CR physics implemented self-consistently. We find that CR pressure suppresses fragmentation and increases the Jeans mass by factors of 2-5 at redshifts z = 10-20. This effect is more pronounced for higher values of the CR diffusion coefficient Dcr. The suppression of fragmentation leads to an increase in the number density of massive stars formed per halo as well as their total luminosity. For our fiducial value of Dcr = 3 \u00d7 1026 cm2 s\u22121 we obtain a factor of 4-10 enhancement over the case without CR feedback. Our results are consistent with recent observations of high-z galaxies. In addition, we show that CR feedback can explain the observed correlation between galaxy stellar masses and black hole masses.

{"text":"We present an overview of recent progress in the development and application of techniques to cool molecules by exploiting their interaction with optical cavities. We discuss how these methods can be used to prepare samples of cold, trapped molecules that are suitable for precision measurements or quantum information processing applications. In particular we focus on two different approaches which have been developed recently at our laboratory: (i) The use of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT), combined with stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP), to produce large numbers of optically trapped ground-state polar molecules. (ii) Cavity-enhanced photoassociation spectroscopy as a tool to study ultracold collisions between alkali-metal atoms. Finally, we briefly outline some possible future directions for this research area. Molecules offer many advantages over atomic systems when it comes to implementing novel quantum technologies such as high-precision metrology [1] , quantum simulation [2] , and quantum networks [3] . However, most molecular species cannot be directly cooled using conventional laser cooling schemes because they lack closed cycling transitions [4] .\nIn order to overcome this problem several alternative cooling strategies have been proposed [5] - [8] . One promising approach is based on the combination of electromagnetically-induced transparency (EIT) [9] and stimulated Raman adiabatic passages (STIRAP) [10] . This method has been successfully applied to create dense ensembles of ground state polar molecules [11] - [13] . Another possibility consists in trapping molecules via photoassociative processes [14] - [16] . Here one exploits the fact that the spontaneous emission rate into bound states increases exponentially with decreasing temperature [17] . By coupling the excited molecular levels to high-finesse optical cavities [18] - [20] , the resulting increase in radiative lifetime leads to efficient trapping [21] - [23] . These techniques allow us to trap up to 10 5 molecules per cm 3 inside a single-mode optical resonator [24] ."}
{"text":"We present new near-infrared (NIR) observations for the radio-loud elliptical galaxy NGC 4261, obtained with the Subaru telescope. The NIR images reveal that this galaxy has an extended dust disk around its nucleus. We find that the isophotes are well fitted by a de Vaucouleurs profile plus an exponential component at large radii. This suggests that there may be two components contributing to the surface brightness distribution; one is associated with the bulge\/disk system while another is related to the dust disk. In addition, we detect a faint ring-like structure surrounding the central region. These results suggest that the dust disk is likely to have been formed through tidal interaction between the host galaxy and a companion galaxy. Our analysis also shows that the dust mass within the innermost 100 pc radius is about 1.5 x 10^6 M_sol. If we assume that the dust-to-gas ratio is similar to Galactic value, then the total gas mass would be 5 x 10^8 M_sol."}

We use the same likelihood function as in Jarosik et al. (2006), but now include also information about the noise covariance matrix and its uncertainty, which was not available at that time. The main goal is to test whether the observed large-scale temperature-polarization correlation can be explained within the standard cosmological model with adiabatic initial conditions and Gaussian primordial fluctuations or it requires some additional physics beyond this simple picture. In particular, we are interested in testing predictions made recently by several authors who suggested that such correlations could arise due to gravitational lensing effects induced by large scale structure along the line-of-sight. Our results show no significant evidence for any deviations from the simplest theoretical models considered here."}

In addition, it also provides accurate prediction on ratedistortion performance at low bit rates. Finally, we demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments conducted on several test sequences. Index Terms -Information theory, Image compression, Video compression. 1 Introduction Data compression has been widely studied over past decades due to its importance in many applications such as digital storage systems, communication networks, medical imaging, etc.. A fundamental problem in data compression is how to accurately predict the compressed file size given the original uncompressed data. This problem is usually referred to as rate-distortion analysis [1] . It is well known that the rate-distortion function characterizes the relationship between the average codeword length and distortion level achieved by any optimal encoding scheme [2] .\nThe most commonly adopted approach to solve the rateconstraint optimization problems is Lagrangian relaxation [3] , which transforms constrained optimization into unconstrained ones via introducing additional variables called Lagrange multipliers [4] . However, solving these problems requires iterative algorithms [5] , which are computationally expensive [6] . To overcome this difficulty, researchers have developed various fast algorithms [7, 8] . Nevertheless, they still suffer from slow convergence speed when applied to practical problems [9] ."}
{"text":"We present an alternative approach to the dynamics of interacting Brownian particles, based on Feynman diagrams and path integrals in phase space. The method is illustrated by considering two examples: (i) the overdamped motion of N identical particles diffusing in one dimension under the influence of pairwise additive interactions; (ii) the diffusion of a single particle in three dimensions with arbitrary time-dependent external forces acting upon it. In both cases we obtain exact results for the mean-square displacement as well as higher-order correlation functions. We also discuss how our formalism can be used to study more complicated systems such as those involving hydrodynamic interactions between particles or active particles that perform directed motions. Interacting Brownian particles are ubiquitous in nature, ranging from colloidal suspensions [1] , granular matter [2] , and biological cells [3] to molecular motors [4] . Their collective behavior often exhibits non-trivial features which cannot be captured within standard statistical mechanics approaches [5] .\nIn this work we develop a new theoretical framework to describe the stochastic dynamics of many-body systems composed of interacting Brownian particles. Our starting point is Feynman's path integral representation [6] of the probability distribution function P(rN;tN|r1t1;r2t2\u2026rntn\u22121), where rN denotes the positions of all particles at times tN=t1,\u2026,tn=N\u0394t, \u0394t being the discretization step size [7, 8] .

{"text":"We present new measurements of the baryonic mass fractions (f bar ) in early-type galaxies, based on spatially resolved kinematics for a sample of 12 nearby elliptical\/S0 galaxies observed with integral field spectroscopy at optical wavelengths.  We use these data to measure f bar , as well as the total stellar masses M * . The results are compared against predictions from semi-analytic models of galaxy formation within the standard \u039bCDM cosmology. Our main conclusions are:  1) For our sample we find that the mean value of f bar is 0.16 \u00b1 0.04, which agrees very well with previous estimates obtained using different techniques. 2) There exists no significant correlation between f bar and either luminosity or velocity dispersion. 3) Semi-analytic models predict values of f bar that are systematically lower than those measured here by about a factor of two. 4) In order to match the observations, it appears necessary to invoke additional physical processes beyond those included in current models."}
{"text":"We study the energy transfer in a network of coupled nonlinear oscillators with time delay, which is motivated by the dynamics of biological systems such as neural networks and genetic regulatory networks. We show that there exists an optimal coupling strength for each individual oscillator to achieve maximum energy transfer efficiency among all other oscillators. The results are obtained through numerical simulations on both small-scale and large-scale networks. In particular, we find that the energy transfer efficiency decreases when the number of nodes increases beyond a certain threshold value. This phenomenon can be explained by the fact that the total amount of available energy per node decreases rapidly due to the increase of the number of nodes. Finally, we discuss possible applications of our findings to real-world problems. Energy transfer plays important roles in many natural phenomena including brain activity [1] , heartbeat [2] , and gene regulation [3] .

The former group has a mean radial velocity of -200km\/sec while the latter shows +100km\/sec. These results suggest that there exist two distinct populations of young stars around Sgr A*; one is associated with the clockwise disk-like structure seen in infrared images and the other may be related to the counter-clockwise rotating ring-like feature recently discovered by Genzel et al.

{"text":"We study the second-harmonic (SH) and third-harmonic (TH) generations in an inhomogeneously broadened cavity with two different resonance frequencies for fundamental wave (FW). We show that, when the intracavity FW intensity reaches its maximum value, both SHG and THG can be enhanced simultaneously by increasing the pumping rate or decreasing the detuning between the two modes. The enhancement is due to the fact that the nonlinear susceptibility becomes larger than zero at this point. This effect has been observed experimentally recently. \n \n In addition, we find that there exists another regime where only one type of harmonics can be generated efficiently while suppressing other types of harmonics. For example, if the intracavity FW field is tuned close to the lower mode frequency, then it will generate mainly SH light but very little TH light; on the contrary, if the intracavty FW field is tuned near the upper mode frequency, then it generates mainly TH light but almost no SH light."}
{"text":"We present an overview of the recent developments in understanding quantum critical phenomena beyond the standard Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson paradigm, focusing on fermion systems with strong electronic correlations and Mott insulating states. We discuss how these new ideas can be applied to understand unconventional superconductivity observed in many strongly correlated materials such as high-Tc cuprates, iron-based compounds, heavy-fermions, organic conductors, etc., which are all characterized by non-Fermi liquid behaviors at low temperatures. In particular we will focus our attention on the concept of \"multi-criticality\" recently proposed for describing the phase diagram of these complex materials near their quantum critical points (QCPs). The idea is that there exist multiple QCPs along different directions in the parameter space of the system, each associated with its own universality class. These QCPs may also have some common features due to the underlying symmetry group of the system."}
{"text":"We present evidence for dark matter annihilation in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) haze, which is an excess emission at large angles with respect to the Galactic center that was first detected by Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP). We use data from Planck and Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT), as well as new measurements of the CMB temperature anisotropies made using the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT).\nThe observed spectrum of this signal can be explained if it originates from dark matter particles with masses between 1 GeV and 10 TeV, annihilating into pairs of photons or leptons. This interpretation requires a boost factor of about 100 relative to standard thermal relic expectations. \n \n If confirmed, our results would provide strong support for models where dark matter self-annihilates into Standard Model particles. They also have important implications on the nature of dark matter itself, since they require either non-thermal production mechanisms or additional interactions beyond those predicted within the minimal supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model."}
{"text":"We present an efficient method for computing the vacuum energy and force between two parallel plates using only standard numerical electromagnetism methods, without resorting to any approximations or special treatments such as analytic continuation into complex frequencies. The key idea is that we can use the Feynman-Kac formula to express the vacuum expectation value of the stress tensor at finite temperature T = 1\/\u03b2 (where \u03b2 is the inverse temperature) in terms of the corresponding quantity at zero temperature but with one additional term involving the time evolution operator over a period of length \u03b2 . We then show how this expression may be evaluated efficiently by expressing it in terms of the Green's function of Maxwell's equations on a periodic domain. This allows us to compute the vacuum energy and force exactly within our computational framework, which consists of solving the vector wave equation numerically on a rectangular grid. Our results are compared against those obtained previously using other approaches, including analytic continuation into complex frequencies and the PFA."}
{"text":"We present new CO(2-1), 13CO(1-0), and C18O(1-0) observations with the IRAM 30m telescope towards the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 4565. The data reveal that this galaxy hosts an extended molecular disk which is warped by interactions with its companion galaxies. We find evidence for two distinct components to the molecular gas distribution; one associated with the main body of the galaxy and another component located along the southern edge of the optical disk. This second component has been previously detected as a dust lane but we show here it also contains significant amounts of molecular gas. In addition, our high resolution maps reveal a prominent central concentration of molecular gas coincident with the position of the AGN. Using these data together with previous results on other galaxies observed within the NUGA survey we investigate how the properties of the molecular gas are related to those of the stars and black holes hosted by each system."}
{"text":"The vapor pressure, solubility in water, and interfacial tension between oil and water are important parameters for understanding the behavior of crude oils during their production or transport through pipelines.  In this study we have investigated these properties using alkanol monolayers on an aqueous subphase as model systems to mimic the hydrocarbon chains present in crude oils. The results show that the vapor pressures of the alkanols increase with chain length up to C8 but decrease again above C10. This is explained by considering the competition between two opposing effects:  On one hand, increasing chain lengths lead to higher molecular volumes which favor evaporation. On the other hand, longer chains also result in stronger van der Waals interactions within the liquid phase leading to lower vapor pressures. We find that the solubilities of the alkanols follow similar trends as those observed for the vapor pressures. However, the differences in solubility among different chain lengths become smaller when compared to the corresponding differences in vapor pressure. Finally, our measurements reveal that the interfacial tensions between the alkanol layers and the underlying water decreases monotonically with chain length."}
{"text":"The Sudbury Neutrino Experiment (SNO) is designed to detect solar neutrinos via neutral current interactions in heavy water and charged-current interactions with deuterium nuclei, as well as by detecting anti-neutrinos produced by nuclear reactors on Earth.  The SNO experiment will use an array of 3 He proportional counters immersed in liquid scintillator to measure the energy deposited by recoil protons resulting from these reactions.  This report describes the design considerations that led to our choice of detector technology and discusses some of the technical challenges associated with this approach. We also present results obtained using a prototype counter constructed at TRIUMF which demonstrate its suitability for use in the SNO experiment. Finally we discuss plans for constructing a large number of such detectors at the SNOLAB underground laboratory near Sudbury Ontario Canada. The Sudbury Neutrino experiment (SNO) is being built to study neutrino properties through detection of solar neutrinos and antineutrinos from terrestrial nuclear power plants. In order to achieve high sensitivity it must be able to accurately determine both the direction and energy of incident particles. To accomplish this task the SNO collaboration has chosen to use a novel technique based upon the measurement of the total kinetic energy of recoiling proton(s). These measurements are made possible by placing a thin layer of pure heavy water inside each of several thousand small cylindrical proportional counters filled with gaseous helium-3. The light output of the scintillation fluid provides information about the position of interaction while the charge collected by the anode wire gives the total energy deposit. A detailed description of the physics motivation behind this approach can be found elsewhere [1] ."}

{"text":"We report on an unusual bright optical transient (OT) discovered by the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF). The OT was detected at R = 16.7 mag and peaked at R = 14.6 mag, with a rise time of about 1 day. It is located near the center of M85, one of the nearest galaxies to our own Milky Way Galaxy. We find that this event has many properties similar to those observed for supernovae Ia but it lacks spectroscopic signatures typical of these events. This suggests that we are witnessing another type of explosion which may be related to some other types of transients such as tidal disruption flares or superluminous supernovae. \n \n Keywords: Supernova, Optical transient, PTF, Tidal disruption flare, Brightest cluster galaxy \n \n Introduction \n \n In recent years there have been several discoveries of extremely luminous optical transients associated with nearby galaxies.

Many of them were found to be associated with supermassive black holes residing in galactic nuclei. However, their exact nature remains unclear. Some authors suggested that they could be caused by tidal disruptions of stars by massive black holes (TDE) (Komossa 2002; Gezari et al. 2009a; Bloom et al. 2011; Holoien et al. 2013b; Arcavi et al. 2014; Brown et al. 2017), while others argued that they might represent new classes of thermonuclear explosions (SNe Ia-like) (Valenti et al. 2009; Kas"}

{"text":"We present the results of our numerical simulations of magnetized, rotating white dwarf stars that undergo accretion-induced collapse (AIC). We find that for sufficiently rapid rotation and strong magnetic fields, AIC leads to an explosion with properties similar to those observed in SNe Ia. The explosion is driven by the release of gravitational energy as the collapsed core bounces back after reaching nuclear density. In addition, we show that the presence of a strong toroidal field can lead to significant asymmetries in the ejecta distribution. These asymmetries are likely responsible for the polarization signal detected in some SNe Ia. \n \n Keywords: Supernovae Type Ia, Rotation, Magnetic Fields, White Dwarf Stars, Accretion Induced Collapse \n \n 1 Introduction \n \n Recent observations have shown that many supernovae type Ia (SNe Ia) exhibit large amounts of linear polarization [1] . This has been interpreted as evidence that these events result from asymmetric explosions [2] , which may be caused by large-scale magnetic fields [3] or rapid rotation [4] . However, it remains unclear whether either mechanism alone could produce such highly polarized light curves [5] . \n \n Here we investigate how the combination of rapid rotation and strong magnetic field affects the outcome of accretion induced collapse (AIC), where a white dwarf star collapses into a neutron star [6] . For this purpose, we perform two-dimensional axisymmetric hydrodynamic simulations using the code FLASH [7] . Our initial models consist of rigidly-rotating white dwarf stars with masses ranging between 0.6-1.2 Msun [8] . To account for the effects of general relativity on the structure of the white dwarf [9] , we use the polytropic equation of state P = K\u03c1 \u0393 , where \u03c1 denotes the mass density and P the pressure [10] . \nThe main goal of this work is to determine if AICs triggered by rapid rotation and\/or strong magnetic fields can explain the high degree of polarization observed in SNe Ia [11] ."}

We identify and classify all galaxies detected within an area of 0.5 deg2 centered around the center of the Coma cluster down to a limiting magnitude of Ks = 18 mag. The majority of these sources are faint red galaxies that have been missed by previous optical surveys due to their low surface brightnesses. Using photometric redshift estimates we find that most of them lie between z=0.1 and z=1.0. By comparing our sample to existing spectroscopic data sets we show that our NIR selection is complete up to M* ~ - 17 + 5 log h70.

The proposed DFA scheme is based on the concept that each node can directly vote its local decision with other nodes' decisions and then obtain final global decision by majority voting rule. In order to reduce communication overheads caused by direct voting process, our scheme adopts two novel techniques: 1) only one-hop neighbors are allowed to cast their votes at any time instant; 2) all nodes use different time slots to transmit their votes simultaneously. We also present theoretical analysis to show how much energy consumption will be saved compared with existing schemes. Finally, extensive simulation results demonstrate that our scheme outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of both accuracy and power efficiency.

The observed widths of these wings correspond to temperatures T ~ 10 4 K for an assumed Doppler parameter b = 20 km s-1 . We argue that this is evidence for infalling gas onto the central black hole.

In particular we find that there exists a critical value of the connection probability above which the system undergoes a phase transition towards a state where all neurons are synchronously firing at high rates. This regime corresponds to what has been observed experimentally as ictal seizures. \n \n Moreover, we study the effect of external stimulation on the dynamics of our network.

We find that the infrared luminosity is consistent with heating by AGN radiation or supernovae remnants within the central kpc region. This suggests that recent feedback energy release has been occurring in these cores. These results are important because they provide new evidence on how supermassive black holes grow through accretion onto their host galaxy centers.

Introduction \n \n Supermassive black holes reside in the center of most massive galaxies. Their growth is thought to be fueled by gas inflow driven by gravitational torques produced during mergers and\/or interactions between galaxies (Barnes & Hernquist 1996; Hopkins et al. 2006) . However, it remains unclear what happens after this fuel supply runs out. One possibility is that the black hole continues growing via radiatively inefficient accretion flows (Narayan & Yi 1994) , which may produce powerful winds and jets that can drive large-scale outflows into the surrounding interstellar medium (ISM) (Silk & Rees 1998; Di Matteo et al. 2005 ). Another possibility is that the black holes become dormant as the ISM becomes too hot to cool efficiently (Bower et al. 2006; Croton et al. 2006 ) until another merger event triggers renewed activity. Understanding the mechanisms responsible for shutting off black-hole growth will help us understand why some galaxies have large black holes while others do not. \n \n 2.

The BAT light curve shows that there are two major flares lasting about 100 days each; these flares were also observed simultaneously at other wavelengths. In addition we find evidence for several smaller bursts occurring between the main flares. Using an improved version of the method developed by Israel et al.

{"text":"The concept of zero point energy is introduced in this article, which describes how it can be used to explain some aspects of the big bang theory. The author also discusses the possibility that dark matter may have been created by such an effect. Finally he considers whether or not there are any other physical effects associated with zero point energy. In particular, he suggests that gravitational waves could possibly be generated by such processes. This article was originally published on ArXiv.org as part of the author's PhD thesis at Imperial College London. It has since been updated for publication here. Zero point energy (ZPE) is defined as the minimum amount of energy required to create particles out of nothing. Although ZPE cannot actually exist because it violates the laws of physics, it does provide useful insight into certain phenomena observed within our universe. For example, if we consider the expansion of space-time during the early stages of the universe's existence, then it seems reasonable to assume that the volume of space increased exponentially over time due to the rapid release of ZPE. If so, then the total mass-energy density would decrease rapidly until all available ZPE had been released. At this stage, the universe would consist solely of vacuum fluctuations, i.e., virtual particles and antiparticles existing simultaneously but never interacting with each other."}

{"text":"We study the Ramsey interference fringes in an ultracold atomic gas trapped by a one-dimensional optical lattice potential and interacting via repulsive contact interactions described by the Tonks-Girardeu model. We show that, for sufficiently strong interaction strength, the system exhibits a transition to a regime where the visibility of the Ramsey fringe pattern is suppressed due to destructive quantum interferences between different scattering channels. The effect can be understood as arising from the formation of bound states within each well of the periodic potential which are responsible for the suppression of tunneling across neighboring wells. Our results demonstrate how the properties of strongly correlated systems can be probed using standard experimental techniques such as Ramsey spectroscopy. Introduction:-Ultracold atoms confined in optical lattices have been used extensively over recent years to explore many-body phenomena [1] . In particular, they provide a unique opportunity to investigate the physics of strongly-correlated fermionic gases [2] , including the crossover from Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) superfluidity at weak coupling [3] to Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) [4] at strong coupling [5] .\nRamsey spectroscopy [6] has become a powerful tool for studying coherent dynamics in these systems [7, 8] . It allows one to probe the energy spectrum [9] or the coherence time [10] of the system through the measurement of the population difference after applying a sequence of radio-frequency pulses [11] . Recently it was shown [12] that this technique also provides information about the nature of correlations present in the system [13] . For example, in Ref. [14] it was demonstrated experimentally that the presence of pairing correlations leads to characteristic features in the Ramsey fringe patterns observed in a Fermi gas [15] . However, despite its successes, there remain several open questions regarding the interpretation of the Ramsey signal [16] ."}
{"text":"We study the obfuscation complexity of planar graphs, which is defined as the minimum number of edges that need to be removed in order for an adversary not to be able to distinguish between two isomorphic copies of the graph. We show that this problem can be solved by solving a linear program with O(n) variables and constraints (where n denotes the number of vertices), or equivalently by finding the maximum matching on a bipartite graph. This yields a polynomial time algorithm for computing the obfuscation complexity. As a corollary we obtain a lower bound on the obfuscation complexity for any n-vertex tree T . Finally, we prove that there are infinitely many trees whose obfuscation complexities equal their numbers of leaves. The obfuscation complexity of a graph G = (V , E ) is defined as the smallest integer k such that removing at most k edges from G makes it indistinguishable from another graph G' = (V ', E'). In other words, if an attacker has access only to the set of all possible subgraphs induced by some subset S \u2286 V \u00d7 V then he cannot tell whether he is looking at G or G' unless |S| > k .\nIn this work we consider the case where G is a planar graph. It turns out that in this setting one can solve the obfuscation complexity problem efficiently using combinatorial techniques. More precisely, our main result shows how to compute the obfuscation complexity exactly via solving a linear program with polynomially many variables and constraints. \nAs a consequence of our results we get a new lower bound on the obfuscatability of trees.

{"text":"We present the results of our study on the possible existence and stability of terrestrial planets around the star Gliese 581, which is located at about 20 light-years away from Earth. We have performed numerical simulations for different orbital configurations of three hypothetical terrestrial planets with masses ranging between 1 to 10 times that of Earth's mass (1-10 M\u2295). Our calculations show that all these systems are dynamically stable over time scales longer than 100 Myr. The most massive planet has an eccentric orbit with e=0.2 and its periastron distance ranges between 0.05 AU and 0.15 AU depending on the initial conditions used. This planet can be considered as a hot Jupiter-like planet because it orbits very close to its host star. However, we find that there exists another region where two or more terrestrial planets may exist stably. In this region, one of them could be a super-Earth-type planet with a mass larger than 5M\u2295 but smaller than 8M\u2295."}
{"text":"We present an extension to the cable model that allows one to account for membrane dynamics in neurons with active conductances over a wide range of time scales and spatial dimensions, including those relevant to subthreshold electrogenesis. The proposed approach is based on a reformulation of the cable equation as a system of first-order differential equations describing voltage changes along the axon or dendrite. This formulation leads naturally to a generalization of the concept of space constants to include both passive and active components of the membrane impedance. We show how this generalized cable formalism can be used to describe propagation of action potentials through a single compartment neuron with Hodgkin-Huxley type currents. Finally we demonstrate its utility by applying it to study spatiotemporal patterns of activity in networks of coupled neurons. Neurons are highly specialized cells capable of generating electrical signals known as action potentials (APs). These APs propagate down the length of the cell's axon toward synaptic terminals where they trigger release of neurotransmitters into the synapse. In turn these transmitters bind to receptors located on the postsynaptic side of the synapse initiating signaling cascades which ultimately lead to generation of new APs. Thus information transfer between neurons occurs via propagating APs across chemical synapses."}
{"text":"We study the relationship between distillable entanglement, entropy-area law (EAL), and von Neumann entropy for two classes of quantum systems -spin chains with nearest-neighbor interactions and harmonic oscillator lattices. We show that EAL holds true if and only if the ground state is unique or degenerate. For non-degenerate ground states we prove that there exists an infinite family of pure product states which are arbitrarily close to the ground state but cannot be obtained by local operations assisted by classical communication (LOCC). This implies that the amount of distillable entanglement can be strictly smaller than the von Neumann entropy of the ground state. Finally, we present numerical evidence suggesting that this phenomenon may occur even when the ground state is unique. The results presented here provide further insight into the nature of entanglement in many-body quantum systems. Entanglement plays a crucial role in various applications ranging from quantum information theory [1] , condensed matter physics [2] , and statistical mechanics [3] . In particular, it has been shown [4] that the ability to create maximally entangled pairs of qubits via LOCC is equivalent to the existence of Bell inequalities [5] .\nIn recent years much attention was devoted to understanding how entanglement behaves under different physical conditions [6] . It turns out [7, 8] that the behavior of entanglement depends on whether the underlying Hamiltonian satisfies certain properties such as uniqueness [9] or degeneracy [10] of its ground state. Moreover, it was found [11] that the presence of multiple ground states leads to a violation of the so-called entropyarea law [12] . However, despite these advances our knowledge about the structure of entanglement in manybody quantum systems remains incomplete [13] .\nThe main goal of this work is to investigate the relation between distillable entanglements [14] , entropy-area law [15] , and von Neumann entropy [16] for two classes of quantum sys-tems -spin chains [17] with nearest neighbor interactions [18] and harmonic oscillator lattices [19] . Our analysis reveals several interesting features of entanglement in many body quantum systems. First, we show that EAL [20] holds true if and only [21] if the ground state [22] is unique"}
{"text":"We study the properties of Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) with an arbitrary number N of particles trapped by a harmonic oscillator and exposed to a disordered external potential. We show that, for any strength of disorder, there is always a finite fraction of atoms localized at each site of the lattice. The localization length decreases as the disorder increases but remains macroscopic even when the disorder becomes very large compared to the interatomic interaction energy. This result holds true both in one dimension and higher dimensions.  In particular we find that the critical disorder above which all states are localized scales like 1\/N in 1D and 1\/d in 2D and 3D where d is the spatial dimension. Our results provide a microscopic understanding of recent experiments on ultracold atomic gases in optical lattices. Introduction:-Recent experimental advances have made it possible to create quantum degenerate gases of bosons or fermions confined in periodic potentials [1] . These systems can be described theoretically using the framework of the Bose-Hubbard model [2] , which has been extensively studied over the past decade [3] .\nIn this work we consider the case of a gas of interacting bosons in a disordered potential. Disorder leads to Anderson localization [4] : eigenstates become exponentially localized around their initial position if the disorder exceeds some threshold value [5] . It was recently shown experimentally [6] that such a system exhibits a transition between extended Bloch-like states and localized Wannier-Stark ladders [7, 8] . However, these experiments were performed only in the weak-disorder regime, i.e., when the disorder amplitude V0 is much smaller than the characteristic hopping matrix element J. Here we investigate how the presence of interactions affects the physics of strongly disordered systems."}

{"text":"We report on the observation of an unusual temperature dependence of the resistive transition width and its scaling with the applied magnetic field for single crystals of MgB2 grown using chemical vapor transport (CVT). The observed behavior is explained within the framework of fluctuation induced vortex pinning, which leads to a reduction of the effective volume fraction of the sample that contributes to the resistance at low temperatures. This effect becomes more pronounced when increasing the external magnetic field strength. We find evidence for this scenario by studying the magnetoresistance as well as the anisotropy of the upper critical fields Hc2(0) and Hc3(0), where we observe a strong increase towards lower temperatures. Our results are consistent with recent theoretical predictions based on microscopic calculations. \n \n In addition, our data show clear signatures of quantum oscillations originating from the Fermi surface topology of MgB2.

We use two different methods to estimate this contribution: i) we calculate the number counts above 100 MeV as function of redshift using a maximum likelihood method; ii) we fit the observed spectral energy distribution with a log-parabola model and derive the integrated fluxes at 0.1 GeV and 10 TeV energies. The resulting contributions are consistent within statistical uncertainties. Our best-fit value is F(>100 MeV) = 2.2 x 10^{\u22128} ph cm\u22122 s\u22121 sr\u22121 which corresponds to ~20% of the measured EGB intensity.

{"text":"We propose a new inflationary model, which is based on the idea that there are two scalar fields in nature and they interact with each other through their potentials. We call this model \"smooth hybrid inflation\" (SHI). In SHI, one field plays the role of the waterfall field while another field acts as an inflaton. The potential for our model has three parameters; we show how these parameters can be fixed by using observational data such as WMAP7+BAO+H0. Our results indicate that the tensor-to-scalar ratio r=0.0055+0.0005-0.0004 at 95% CL. This value is consistent with recent observations.

{"text":"The first law of thermodynamics is usually presented as an assertion about entropy, but it can be derived in other ways.  This article presents one such derivation using statistical mechanics and information theory.   The result is that entropy is defined by the amount of uncertainty associated with a system's state (or lack thereof).   Entropy increases when there are more possible states for which we cannot predict what will happen to the system.   In this sense, entropy measures how much our knowledge decreases when we learn something new about the world around us.   ...   ...   ...   ...   The second law of thermodynamics asserts that entropy always increases over time.   However, if you look closely at the definition of entropy given above, you'll see that it's not clear whether or not entropy actually does increase over time.   To answer this question, let's consider two different systems, A and B, both of which start out in equilibrium.   System A has only one possible configuration while system B has many possible configurations.   If we were able to observe these systems, we'd find that they have exactly the same energy levels and temperatures.   But now imagine that we're observing them through a tiny window so that we can't tell what's going on inside each system.   We'd then conclude that system A looks like its temperature was higher than system B because there's less uncertainty about its future behavior.   Now suppose that we let system A evolve into system C, where all particles are arranged in perfect order.   Then system C would appear colder than system A even though their energies remained unchanged.   So far we've seen that entropy doesn't necessarily increase over time.   It could decrease instead...."}
{"text":"We report the distance measurement toward the Galactic center using Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) observations at 22 GHz and 43 GHz in combination with Japanese VLBI Exploration of Radio Astrometry (VERA). The parallax was measured by observing Sgr A*, which is located near the Galactic center, for two years between 2007 and 2009. We found that the distance to the Galactic center is R0 = 8 kpc \u00b1 0.4 kpc. This value agrees well with previous measurements based on other methods such as infrared photometry or trigonometric parallaxes of masers associated with massive young stars. Our result also supports the hypothesis that the Milky Way has an axisymmetric mass distribution around its central black hole. \n \n Keywords: Distance scale, Galaxy, Parallax, Space astrometry, Black holes \n \n \n \n 1 Introduction \n \n In order to understand how galaxies evolve over time, it is important to know their distances accurately. However, accurate distances are difficult to measure because they depend strongly on the assumed luminosity evolution model. For example, if we assume too high a rate of luminosity evolution, then the derived distance will be underestimated. On the other hand, if we assume too low a rate of luminosity evolu-tion, then the derived distance may be overestimated. Therefore, it is necessary to determine the correct luminosity evolution model before deriving the distance to any galaxy. \n \n One way to solve this problem is to use radio sources whose distances can be determined independently through other means. These include pulsars, quasars, and maser sources associated with star-forming regions. Among these objects, maser sources have been used most frequently since they provide very precise distance estimates. Maser sources are usually associated with star forming regions where water vapor molecules form into microscopic crystals known as ice grains. When the ice grains grow larger than about one micron, they become unstable against gravitational collapse and begin emitting intense radiation. Since the emission line widths of maser sources are extremely narrow compared to those of normal radio"}
{"text":"We report on an experiment to measure the Casimir-Lifhsztz (CL) interaction between two gold-coated glass plates immersed in water at room temperature and pressure. The CL force is measured by observing the Brownian motion of one plate with respect to another, using optical interferometry.

{"text":"We present deep radio observations at 1.4 GHz with the VLA towards two TeV gamma-ray emitting regions, one associated to the open cluster Cyg OB2 #8 (HESS J1640-465) and another located near the massive star WR 25 (HESS J1641-463). The new data reveal extended emission around both TeV sources which is not detected by previous surveys. We discuss possible scenarios for this emission based on our results as well as those obtained recently by other authors. In particular we propose that the observed structures are due to synchrotron radiation produced by relativistic electrons accelerated in shocks driven by stellar winds interacting within these clusters. This scenario would also explain why no X-ray counterparts have been found so far despite deep searches carried out with Chandra and XMM-Newton telescopes. Finally, we estimate the magnetic field strength required to produce such emission using standard models for particle acceleration in colliding wind binaries. \nIntroduction\n\nThe Cygnus OB2 association contains more than 100 OB stars distributed over an area of about 50 square degrees centered at l = 80\u00b0and b = 1\u00b0 (  Fig.   1a ). It has been suggested that many of them could be members of binary systems or even multiple systems (e.g., Kn\u00f6dlseder 2000; Wright et al. 2010) . These objects can drive powerful winds into their surroundings creating strong shocks where particles may be accelerated up to very high energies. If some of these particles escape from the shock fronts they will interact with photons coming from the surrounding interstellar medium producing high-energy electromagnetic radiation detectable across most of the electromagnetic spectrum including the TeV range. \n \n Several studies suggest that several of the known TeV sources in the sky might be related to young open clusters like Cyg OB2 (see e.g., Aharonian et al. 2005a ,b, 2007a .

The result is consistent with the prediction based on Seiberg duality.  In addition to this, our analysis shows how the gluino condensates are related between different vacua which have different values of the vacuum expectation value of the scalar field. This relation provides us with information about the phase structure of the theory. Finally, we discuss possible extensions of our results beyond perturbation theory. Supersymmetry has been proposed as a solution to the hierarchy problem [1] . However, it also predicts new particles whose masses should be at most around 1 TeV [2] , but so far no such particle has been observed experimentally [3] . Therefore, if supersymmetry exists, its breaking must occur at some high energy scale [4] .\nIn order to understand the physics behind supersymmetry breaking, it would be very useful to know what happens when supersymmetry is broken spontaneously [5] . For example, suppose that supersymmetry is broken dynamically [6] . Then there will exist light pseudo-scalar fields called goldstinos [7, 8] . These fields interact weakly with ordinary matter through their Yukawa couplings [9] . If these interactions were sufficiently strong, they could lead to observable effects [10] .

{"text":"The atmospheric muon charge ratio is measured using data collected by the MINOS experiment in its first phase (1998) (1999) (2000) and second phase (2001) (2002) .

The results obtained with the two methods agree within statistical uncertainties.

{"text":"The cut-off covering spectrum is the set of all functions in $L^2(\\mathbb{R})$ whose Fourier transforms are supported on $[-1,1]$ and have absolute value at most 1 everywhere.  It was introduced by David Hilbert as an example of a non-trivial closed subspace of $L^2$ that does not contain any nonconstant entire analytic function.   In this talk we will discuss some recent results about the structure of the cut-off covering spectrum. The first part of our discussion concerns the problem of determining whether or not a given bounded linear operator on $L^2$ has finite rank.    We show how to use the theory of Toeplitz operators with matrix symbols developed by Sarason and others to give a complete solution to this problem for certain classes of operators including those arising from multiplication by polynomials.   For other classes of operators such as those coming from multiplication by trigonometric polynomials it turns out that there exist examples which do not fall into one of these categories but still have finite rank.     The second part of our discussion concerns a theorem due to Joram Lindenstrauss concerning the existence of extremal points in the unit ball of the space of continuous functions on the circle with absolutely convergent Fourier series.   This theorem can be viewed as a generalization of the classical result of Carleson stating that every point in the unit ball of $H^1_0(T)$ (the Hardy space of order 1)  is an extreme point of the unit ball of $H^1_o(T)$ where $T = [0,2\\pi]$.

The critical value Uc depends strongly on the magnetic field h. For small fields we obtain Uc = 0.5t while for larger fields Uc decreases rapidly as h increases. In addition, we show how the FRG can be used to calculate the single-particle spectral function A(k, \u03c9) which exhibits a gapless dispersion relation near kF . Finally, we discuss possible extensions of our work. Introduction:-The physics of correlated electrons has been studied extensively over many years [1] - [4] .

We use two different families of BBH models, one based on post-Newtonian theory and another based on full general relativity simulations.

For each model we compute the signal-to-noise ratio as a function of total mass M , spin magnitude a1, and spin orientation angle \u03b91 between the orbital angular momentum vector and the component spins. In addition to computing these quantities in the frequency domain, we also perform time-domain analysis where we calculate the overlap reduction function between the template and the data. Finally, we compare our results against those obtained previously by other authors who used similar methods but only considered non-spinning binaries or restricted their attention to equal-mass systems. Our main findings can be summarized as follows:  1) Matched filtering: We find that the optimal SNR is maximized when the spin vectors align with the orbital angular momentum vector.  2) Time-domain analysis: We show that the effect of spin-orbit coupling leads to an increase in the duration of the ringdown phase compared to the case without spin."}

The agreement between theory and experiment is improved if we assume that the central density of the progenitor star was higher than previously thought. This result suggests that future observations of gravitational waves emitted during the collapse phase may be able to provide information about the structure of the progenitor stars prior to their explosion. In addition, our study shows that the effect of convection plays only a minor role in determining the temporal behavior of the neutrino fluxes detected by KamLAND."}
{"text":"We present an overview of our recent work on the emergence of Cooper pairing in strongly correlated electronic systems with emphasis on high temperature superconductivity (HTSC) in cuprates. We discuss how the concept of \"duality\" can be used to understand the rich physics associated with HTSC. In particular we show that the pseudogap state is dual to the normal state and that this duality leads naturally to the existence of two distinct types of charge carriers - fermions and bosons. The latter are responsible for the formation of Cooper pairs which give rise to superfluidity at low temperatures. Finally we review some of the experimental results obtained by angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), scanning tunneling microscopy\/spectroscopy (STM\/STS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). These experiments provide strong evidence supporting our theoretical picture of HTSC. This article is part of a series of articles based on invited lectures presented during the International School of Physics \"Enrico Fermi\" held in Como, Italy, September 8-19, 2007 ."}
{"text":"We present results on the distribution of the most massive primordial (Pop III) stars in dark matter halos at redshifts 6 < z < 10, based on cosmological hydrodynamic simulations with radiative transfer. We find that these stars are typically located close to the center of their host halo, where they can be found within an effective radius of 0.5 kpc for Mvir = 1011 -1012 M\u2299 halos. The number density profiles of Pop III stars show significant scatter around the mean profile, which is well described by a power law with index -1.7 \u00b1 0.3. This result implies that the majority of Pop III stars reside in small galaxies or dwarf galaxies at high redshift. In addition we study how the properties of Pop III stars depend on the mass of their host galaxy. Our main findings are:  1. For low-mass halos (Mvir < 1010 M\u2299), Pop III stars form preferentially near the center of the halo.  2. For more massive halos (1010 < Mvir\/M\u2299 < 1012 ), Pop III stars tend to be distributed over larger distances from the center of the halo."}
{"text":"We study the phenomenological consequences of radion stabilization by introducing an explicit mass term for the radion into realistic warped space models with bulk gauge fields and fermions. We find that, depending on the model parameters, there are two possible scenarios which can be realized at low energies: (i) The radion is heavy enough to decouple from all Standard Model particles. (ii) The radion couples directly to Standard Model particles but its effects are suppressed due to mixing between the radion and the Higgs boson. In both cases we show how the radion affects precision electroweak observables such as S, T , W , Y . Finally, we discuss the possibility of detecting the radion through direct production at future colliders. Introduction: One of the most interesting features of Randall-Sundrum type I [1] or II [2] models is their ability to generate hierarchies among fundamental scales without fine-tuning [3] . However, these models suffer from the presence of a scalar field called the radion whose vacuum expectation value determines the size of extra dimensions [4] .\nIn this work we consider the case where the radion acquires a large mass so it does not affect low-energy physics [5] . On the other hand, if the radion remains light then it may have observable effects [6] - [8] . For example, one could imagine that the radion mixes strongly with the Higgs boson leading to deviations from standard predictions [9] . Alternatively, the radion might couple directly to Standard Model particles [10] . In either scenario, the radion would contribute to precision electroweak measurements [11] - [13] . This motivates us to investigate whether the radion has any effect on precision electroweak data within realistic warped space models [14] - [16] ."}
{"text":"The gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are the most energetic explosions in the universe, but their origin is still unknown. The GRB associated with supernovae may be one possible source for these mysterious phenomena.  In this work we present an analysis of the data obtained by the Compton Observatory on board the Solar Maximum Mission satellite and show that there was no significant correlation between the time profiles of the GRB and the light curve of the supernova SN1987A. We also discuss some other possibilities which could explain our results.

They are characterized by extremely bright flashes lasting only a few seconds [3] . Their energy output can exceed 1053 ergs [4] , making them the most powerful events known in the Universe [5] .\n-The first detection of a GRB was made using the BATSE instrument aboard the Compton GRO spacecraft [6] . Since then many satellites such as BeppoSAX [7] , HETE-2 [8] , Swift [9] , Fermi [10] etc., have detected thousands of GRBs [11] .

{"text":"We present 8.4 GHz Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) images and light curves for the supernova remnant (SNR) associated with the Type IIb supernova SN2004et, which exploded in the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 6946 on 2004 September 24 UT1. The radio emission is dominated by two bright components separated by ~0.5 arcsec at all epochs observed between 2005 January and 2007 December. We find that both components are expanding with velocities of ~5000 km\/s, consistent with previous estimates based on single-dish data. However, we also detect significant proper motions of ~1000 km\/s for each component over this period. These results suggest an age of about 3 years for the SNR, implying a distance to NGC 6946 of 4 Mpc. This value is significantly smaller than previously estimated distances to this object using other methods. Our measurements provide new constraints on models of core-collapse supernovae. \n \n Keywords: Supernova remnants"}
{"text":"We present the results on gamma-ray emission from supernova remnants (SNRs) obtained with the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT).

We find that all systems have distances consistent with their being located within 20 pc of Earth. The derived absolute magnitudes range between MV = 12.5 and 14.1 mag, corresponding to luminosities of 1030 - 1600 L\u2299 . These values are significantly brighter than those predicted by theoretical models of these objects, indicating either an underestimate of the mass transfer rates or an overestimate of the white dwarf masses. In addition we use our new parallaxes together with previously published data to derive improved estimates of the orbital periods and component masses for three of the targets studied here. Finally, we discuss how our results can be used to test current evolutionary scenarios for this class of binary system."}

We find that the observed flux is consistent with previous measurements by EGRET but higher than those reported by AGILE and Fermi-GBM experiments. This discrepancy may be explained by different angular resolutions of these instruments. Our analysis shows no significant time variability for the total emission as well as its individual components.

{"text":"Soft particle production in relativistic heavy ion collisions is one of the most important observables for understanding the properties of strongly interacting matter produced in these reactions.  In this talk, I will present results on soft hadron and photon production obtained by the PHOBOS experiment at RHIC. The main focus will be on systematics observed as functions of collision centrality, beam energy, transverse momentum (pT), rapidity (y) and azimuthal angle (#phi). These observations are compared with theoretical predictions based on hydrodynamic models and transport calculations. Finally, we discuss how to use these measurements to extract information about the equation-of-state of nuclear matter. This work was supported by DOE grant DE-FG02-97ER41022. AMS-02 collaboration has recently reported that the positron fraction increases above 10 GeV [1] . It is generally believed that such an increase can only come from astrophysical sources like pulsars or supernova remnants [2] , but it may also have contributions from dark matter annihilation [3] .\nIn order to understand whether there exists any contribution from dark matter annihilations, it is necessary to know precisely what happens to electrons\/positrons during their propagation through space [4] . However, our knowledge of cosmic ray propagation is limited due to uncertainties associated with solar modulation effects [5] . To overcome this difficulty, we propose to measure the fluxes of primary cosmic rays using satellites [6] ."}
{"text":"We propose an information processing system based on spin wave bus and inductive coupling between circuits. The proposed circuit is composed of two types of elements, the first one being a conventional semiconductor device which can be used as a logic gate or memory cell, while the second element consists in a magnetic insulator layer sandwiched by two ferromagnetic layers that are connected to each other via tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) effect. We show how this structure allows us to perform both logic operations and data transmission using spin waves. Finally we discuss some possible applications of our proposal such as quantum computing architectures and neuromorphic systems. This article is available from: http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1601.00571. Inductively coupled circuits have been widely studied recently because they offer several advantages over their classical counterparts [1] . For example, these devices allow high speed operation [2] , low power consumption [3] , and reduced crosstalk [4] .\nIn addition, it has been shown theoretically [5] and experimentally [6] that inductive coupling could also lead to new functionalities like nonlocal gates [7, 8] and entanglement generation [9] . However, most of the studies performed so far were focused only on electronic components [10] . Here, we consider instead spin-wave-based circuits [11] where information is coded into propagating spin-waves [12] . These spin waves can be generated electrically [13] or optically [14] and propagate through different media [15] including semiconductors [16] , metals [17] , and insulators [18] . They can even travel across vacuum [19] . Therefore, spin waves provide a promising alternative to electrons [20] since they do not suffer from Coulomb interactions [21] nor scattering [22] . Moreover, spin waves can carry much more information than electrons [23] due to their higher density [24] ."}
{"text":"We have analyzed Chandra observations for eight galaxy clusters with redshifts between 0.1 and 0.3 to determine their radial temperature, density, pressure, entropy, cooling time, and metallicity profiles. We find that all these quantities are well described by single-parameter scaling relations as functions of radius r normalized by the virial radius Rvir.  The best-fit values of the normalization parameters depend on redshift but not significantly so; we therefore adopt fixed values based on our results for the two most distant clusters (z = 0.2 and 0.3) which yield good fits to the other six clusters. Our main conclusions are:  1. All cluster properties show significant evolution out to z ~ 0.3; this is consistent with previous studies using XMM data. 2. The gas fraction fgas(r\/Rvir), defined as the ratio of the total thermal energy within a sphere of radius r to its gravitational binding energy, decreases monotonically outwards; it also shows some evidence for evolution with redshift. 3. The electron number density ne(r) increases inwardly toward the center of each cluster until reaching a peak value near r ~ 0.1r200 where r200 denotes the radius enclosing an average overdensity of 200 times the critical density of the universe. Beyond this point, ne(r) declines slowly or remains roughly constant depending on the cluster. 4. The mean molecular weight \u00b5e(r) increases outwardly due to the increasing contribution of helium ions relative to hydrogen atoms. 5. The central temperatures T0 inferred from spectral fitting range from 6 keV to 12 keV, while those obtained directly from the deprojected temperature profile lie in the range 7-15 keV. These differences may be caused by non-thermal components such as AGN jets and\/or magnetic fields."}
{"text":"We study the thermoelectric properties of a one-dimensional Hubbard chain with nearest-neighbor hopping and on-site Coulomb repulsion, which is known to exhibit charge-density wave (CDW) order at half-filling. We find that this CDW state has an enhanced Seebeck coefficient compared to its metallic counterpart without CDW ordering. This enhancement can be understood as arising from the opening up of a gap between the conduction band and valence bands due to the formation of the CDW phase. The magnitude of the Seebeck coefficient increases monotonically with increasing strength of the electron-electron interaction U. In addition, we show that the power factor S(T)S(0), where S(T) is the temperature dependent Seebeck coefficient, also exhibits a monotonic increase with increasing U. Finally, we discuss how these results may apply to the recently discovered cobaltate materials such as Na$_x$CoO2."}

{"text":"We present an evolutionary model that describes the emergence of genes, species and their interactions in terms of physical principles. The model is based on the concept of self-assembly as it occurs during the formation of biological macromolecules such as proteins or nucleic acids. We show how this process leads to the spontaneous appearance of functional units which we call \"gene families\". Gene families are defined by common sequence motifs and can be seen as building blocks for more complex organisms. In our approach, these building blocks evolve into new species through mutations and selection processes. Species interact with each other via chemical reactions mediated by enzymes. These interactions lead to the formation of metabolic networks whose structure reflects the underlying network topology of the interacting species. Finally, we demonstrate how the proposed model reproduces several important features observed in real-world systems including preferential attachment, scale-free degree distributions and small world properties. Our results suggest that the basic mechanisms driving the evolution of life may have been already established at its very beginning."}
{"text":"We study the thermodynamics of the Schwarzschild-de Sitter (SdS) black hole by using the tunneling method, which is based on the WKB approximation to quantum gravity. We find that there are two kinds of Hawking radiations for this black hole: one is thermal radiation with temperature T = 1\/2\u03c0r0, where r0 is the radius of event horizon; another is nonthermal radiation with temperature T = 0. The latter can be regarded as the effect of the cosmological constant \u039b. In addition, we also calculate the entropy of the SdS black hole and show that it agrees well with Bekenstein-Hawking entropy when the mass M \u226b 1\/(8\u03c0G\u039b). Finally, we discuss some possible applications of our results. It has been shown recently that the existence of the cosmological constant leads to new phenomena in physics [1] . For example, the vacuum fluctuations around an electrically charged particle lead to spontaneous emission [2] , while those around a neutral particle result in stimulated emission [3] . Moreover, the presence of the cosmological constant may affect the evaporation process of black holes [4] .\nIn fact, the effects of the cosmological constant have already been studied extensively in the literature [5] - [8] . However, most works focus only on static or stationary black holes. Recently, the authors [9] investigated the thermodynamic properties of the Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m-de Sitter (RNdS) black hole by applying the tunneling method [10] . They found that besides the usual thermal radiation, there exists another kind of Hawking radiation whose temperature vanishes at the end point of evaporation. This phenomenon was interpreted as the effect of the negative pressure due to the cosmological constant [11] . Furthermore, they showed that the entropy of the RNdS black hole agrees very well with BekensteinHawking entropy [12] if its charge Q satisfies Q \u226b G\/(2\u03c0\u2113), where \u2113 denotes the radius of the event horizon."}
{"text":"We have performed ab initio molecular dynamics simulations to study the in-plane structure, order parameters, and surface tension of liquid Na(l) in contact with vacuum or solid NaCl (001). We find that the density profile is strongly dependent on the presence of an underlying substrate; it exhibits a pronounced double peak for the case without substrate but becomes single-peaked when the substrate is present. The height fluctuations are found to be larger than those observed experimentally by STM measurements. This discrepancy may arise due to the fact that our simulation cell contains only one layer of liquid sodium atoms while experiments typically involve several layers. In addition, we observe that the average nearest neighbor distance decreases as the number of layers increases. Our results show that the in-plane structure of liquid sodium can be significantly influenced by its environment. Finally, we calculate the surface tensions using two different methods and compare them against each other."}

{"text":"We investigate the evolution of an eruptive coronal mass ejection (CME) by using three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations, which include both ideal MHD effects and resistivity. The initial condition is constructed as follows. First we solve the Grad-Shafranov equation for force-free equilibrium to obtain the distribution of poloidal current density on the surface of a torus-like structure. Then we construct a 3D model of the torus-like structure by assuming that it has uniform temperature T = 1 MK and pressure P = 0.1 dyn cm-2 inside its volume. We also assume that there are two types of plasma flows along the field lines; one is slow solar wind flowing out from the bottom boundary at r = 2 R_sun , where Rsun denotes the radius of the Sun, and another is fast solar wind flowing into the top boundary at r = 20 Rsun . Finally, we add random fluctuations to the velocity fields so that they have kinetic energy comparable to their thermal energies. \n \n In our simulation runs, we find three different phases during the CME evolution. During phase I, the magnetic flux rope rises slowly due to the Lorentz force associated with the toroidal component of the magnetic field. At t ~ 50 min., when the height reaches about 5 RSUN , the rising motion suddenly accelerates because of the rapid expansion of the flux rope's cross section caused by magnetic reconnection between open field lines and closed loops around the flux rope. This acceleration continues until the flux rope reaches the upper boundary at t ~ 80 min. . \n \n During phase II, the flux rope expands rapidly outward while maintaining its shape. After reaching the maximum size at t ~ 90 min. , however, the flux rope starts contracting inward again. As a result, the flux rope becomes thinner than before but still maintains its twisted structure. Meanwhile, the surrounding open field lines become more bent toward each other near the center of the flux rope. These results suggest that the flux rope undergoes a kink instability after expanding outward beyond its critical size."}
{"text":"We propose that the energy release process in coronal mass ejections (CMEs) is due to two different physical mechanisms, magnetic reconnection and catastrophic loss of equilibrium driven by ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) instabilities.  The first mechanism releases free magnetic energy stored in the corona into kinetic energy of plasma flows during solar eruptive events such as flares or CMEs. This mechanism has been studied extensively using numerical simulations based on resistive MHD models with various levels of complexity ranging from simple two-dimensional configurations to more realistic three-dimensional ones. In this work we focus our attention on the second mechanism which involves rapid conversion of magnetic field energy into thermal energy through an explosive reconfiguration of the magnetic topology. We show how this mechanism can be modeled analytically within the framework of ideal MHD theory. Our results suggest that both processes are likely to operate simultaneously but at different stages of evolution of the erupting flux rope."}

The calculations are performed using the NNPDF2.3QED parton distribution functions and we use the CT14NNLO PDF set to estimate theoretical uncertainties due to missing higher orders. Our predictions are compared against data collected by ATLAS and CMS experiments at centre-of-mass energies of 8 TeV and 13 TeV. \nIntroduction\n\nThe Large Hadron Collider (LHC), located at CERN near Geneva, Switzerland, is currently operating at its highest energy ever achieved during Run 2. In this regime, it will be possible to produce new particles predicted by extensions of the Standard Model such as supersymmetric partners or extra gauge bosons. One of the most important goals of the LHC program is therefore to discover evidence of physics beyond the Standard Model through precision measurements of Standard-Model processes. Among them, Higgs-boson production plays an essential role since it provides crucial information about the mechanism responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking. \n \n At leading order (LO), Higgs-boson production can occur via gluon fusion, which proceeds mainly through heavy-quark loops, or vector-boson-fusion (VBF). Higher-order QCD corrections have been computed analytically [1\u20133] and numerically [4\u20136] . They increase significantly the LO prediction [7,8] , especially when going towards high values of the Higgs-boson mass mH [9] . This effect has been observed experimentally [10] . \nIn addition to the large logarithmic terms that appear at each order in perturbation theory, there exist subleading contributions associated with collinear emissions of soft gluons off initial-state quarks [11, 12] .

{"text":"We have studied the thick brane model in which our universe is embedded into an extra dimension and found that it can explain some recent observations such as cosmic microwave background anisotropy, supernovae Ia data and baryon acoustic oscillations without introducing any new physics beyond standard model. \n \n In this model, we assume that there exists a scalar field whose potential has two degenerate minima at different values of the vacuum expectation value (VEV). The VEVs are determined by the parameters of the potential. We find that if the difference between these VEVs is large enough to satisfy the condition for the existence of stable domain walls then the thickness of the wall becomes larger than the Hubble radius today. This means that the domain walls cannot be produced during inflationary epoch. On the other hand, if the difference between these vacua is small compared to the Hubble scale, the domain walls will be created after inflation but they decay before nucleosynthesis era due to their extremely high tension."}
{"text":"We present an approach to the description of macroscopic configurations in terms of quantum states, which is based on the concept of entanglement entropy and its generalization for mixed states. We show that this representation allows one to obtain exact results for some statistical properties of systems with many degrees of freedom. In particular, we consider the problem of calculating the partition function of classical spin models at high temperatures. The proposed method can be used as a basis for constructing approximate algorithms for solving problems related to the calculation of thermodynamic characteristics of complex systems. Introduction.\nThe main goal of statistical mechanics is to describe the behavior of macroscopic objects (for example, gases) by using microscopic information about their constituents (atoms). This task becomes especially difficult when dealing with large systems consisting of many particles or spins. For such cases, it is necessary to use approximations, since direct calculations are impossible due to the exponential growth of the number of possible microstates with increasing system size N . One of these approaches is the so-called mean-field approximation [1] , according to which each particle interacts only with all other particles simultaneously; i.e., the interaction between different pairs of particles is neglected. However, even within this simplified model, the calculation of the partition function Z = Tr exp(\u2212\u03b2H) (1) remains extremely complicated [2] .\nIn recent years, there has been growing interest in developing new methods for describing macroscopic configurations in terms similar to those used in quantum physics [3] - [8] . These studies were inspired by the fact that both classical and quantum descriptions have certain common features [9] : they are formulated in terms of wave functions \u03c8(x), where x denotes either positions of particles or spins, respectively. Moreover, the evolution of these wave functions obeys the same Schr\u00f6dinger equation ih\u2202 t |\u03c8(t) = H|\u03c8(t) , where H is the corresponding Hamiltonian operator. It should also be noted that the density matrix \u03c1 = |\u03c8(t) \u03c8(t)| plays the role of a probability distribution in both theories [10] ."}
{"text":"We present the results of multiepoch radial velocity (RV) observations for four late-type M dwarfs and three brown dwarf candidates with spectral types ranging between M3V-M8V, obtained using the High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS). We find no evidence for RV variability in any of these targets at levels greater than ~1 m\/s over timescales up to several years.  These results are consistent with previous studies that have found little or no evidence for giant planets around low-mass stars and substellar objects. The lack of detectable RV variations is likely due to the small masses and\/or radii of the companions expected if they exist. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that some of our targets harbor terrestrial mass planets on orbits with periods longer than those probed by our current data set. Future high-precision RV measurements will be required to determine whether such planets do indeed exist."}
{"text":"We present an alternative derivation of Einstein gravity, which does not use the axiom of choice and is based on the concept that topology can be hidden inside general relativity (GR). We show how to construct a set of local coordinates for any given spacetime point such that all points with the same coordinate values are connected by geodesics. This construction allows us to define a metric tensor at each point as well as its inverse. The resulting theory has exactly the same field equations as standard GR but it contains additional degrees of freedom corresponding to the number of disconnected components of the underlying space. These extra degrees of freedom do not affect classical solutions because they correspond to gauge transformations. However, we argue that these new degrees of freedom may play an important role when considering quantum effects. In particular, we discuss possible implications of our approach for black hole entropy calculations. Finally, we comment on some open problems related to this work."}

The former is an event in which the source star passes close to both lenses; we find that it has a total mass of 1.4 solar masses at a distance of 4 kpc. The latter system consists of three bodies -the lens, its host star, and another distant companion-that are all gravitationally bound together. This binary-lens event exhibits significant deviations from standard single-lens behavior due to the presence of this third body. Using our new measurement technique, we determine the mass ratio between the lens components as well as their projected separation on the sky."}
{"text":"We calculate the bulk viscosity for a strongly interacting fermion system at finite temperature and density using the relaxation time approximation (RTA). We find that the RTA is not applicable to the case where the chemical potential $\\mu$ approaches zero, because the relaxation rate vanishes as $1\/\\mu^2$. In this regime we use an alternative approach based on the Kubo formula with the spectral function obtained by solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation numerically. The results show that the bulk viscosity increases rapidly near the critical point due to the enhancement of the relaxation rate caused by the increase of the effective mass. This behavior can be understood intuitively within the framework of Landau's theory of second-order phase transitions. Finally, we discuss how our result could be used to study the dynamics of neutron stars. Bulk viscosity plays an important role in understanding the damping mechanism of pulsar glitches. \n \n In recent years there has been considerable interest in studying the properties of dense nuclear matter such as quark-gluon plasma or color-flavor-locked (CFL) state [1] . It was suggested [2] that the bulk viscosity may play an important role in explaining the observed rapid spin-down of young pulsars [3] , which cannot be explained by conventional mechanisms [4] . \n \n In this Letter, we present numerical calculations of the bulk viscosity for a CFL superfluid at finite temperatures and densities.

However, it turns out that the relaxation rate decreases very quickly as one moves towards lower temperatures [6] . Therefore, the applicability of the RTA becomes questionable if the chemical potential $\\mu \\ll T$ [7, 8] .

{"text":"We present an analysis of chemical equilibrium and disequilibrium processes occurring in the atmospheres of substellar mass objects (SMBOs). We have developed a new method for calculating departures from chemical equilibrium, which is based on the assumption that all species are in local thermodynamic equilibrium with each other at any given point within the atmosphere. This approach allows us to calculate the abundances of individual molecular species as functions of altitude above the photosphere. The results show that there can be significant deviations from chemical equilibrium even under conditions where the gas temperature is much higher than the dust temperature. In particular, we find that carbon monoxide may become depleted by several orders of magnitude relative to its abundance predicted by chemical equilibrium models. These findings suggest that SMBO observations should take into account possible non-equilibrium effects when interpreting their spectra. \n \n Keywords: Chemical equilibrium; Dust grains; Local thermodynamic equilibrium"}

{"text":"We introduce the concept of generalized conditional random fields (GCRFs) and show how they can be used to model arbitrary probability distributions over structured data sets, such as sequences or trees.  We present an efficient algorithm for learning GCRF parameters using gradient descent on the log-likelihood objective function.   Finally we demonstrate that our approach is able to learn accurate models for several challenging sequence labeling tasks including part-of-speech tagging in natural language processing and protein secondary structure prediction in bioinformatics. Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) (Lafferty et al., 2001 ) are undirected graphical models which have been successfully applied to many problems involving sequential data, e.g. (Sha & Pereira, 2003) . In this work, we propose Generalized Conditional Random Fields (GCRFs), a generalization of CRFs which allows us to represent any distribution over structured data sets like sequences or trees. The key idea behind GCRFs is to use a set of latent variables to capture dependencies between different parts of the input space. This enables us to efficiently compute the partition function required by standard CRFs with dynamic programming techniques. Furthermore, it also makes it possible to train GCRFs using gradient-based methods similar to those employed for Maximum Entropy Markov Models (MEMMs). To evaluate the performance of our method, we apply it to two important applications: part-of-speech taggin"}

{"text":"We report near-infrared coronagraphic observations of the young binary system UY Aurigae (=V773 Tau) obtained with the Subaru Telescope in December 2005 and January 2006, using the newly installed HiCIAO instrument equipped with an occulting mask. The data were reduced by subtracting dark frames and flat fields to remove detector biases and pixel-to-pixel variations respectively. We then applied aperture photometry on each frame after masking out bad pixels and cosmic rays. Finally we averaged all the individual frames together for each filter bandpass. Our results show that there is no significant difference between our two epochs of observation within the uncertainties. In addition, we find that the flux ratio between the primary star and its companion varies significantly depending upon which filter was used during the observations. This suggests that the spectral energy distribution of UY Aur may be changing over time as it evolves towards the main sequence. \n \n Keywords: Young stars"}

We found that the mean radial velocity of all galaxies in this supercluster relative to its center amounts to -500 km\/s. This value agrees well with estimates made earlier for other superclusters. However, we also discovered an unexpected feature of the motion of galaxies inside the UMS. Namely, there are two groups of galaxies moving towards each other along the line connecting their centers.

{"text":"We have demonstrated the first polymer optical fiber (POF) demultiplexer using a single-mode POF and multimode interference couplers (MMI). The device consists of three MMI's with different lengths, which are connected in series to form a Mach-Zehnder interferometer structure. A broadband light source is coupled into one end of the input POF through a lens system consisting of two lenses. Light emerging at each output port was detected by a photodiode array after passing through another lens system. We obtained a maximum extinction ratio of 20 dB between adjacent channels over a wavelength range of 1530-1570 nm for a channel spacing of 0.8 nm.

We find that this newly discovered activity can be described as a series of short-lived bursts lasting for about 100 s each. These events are separated by longer periods of quiescence which last up to several hours. During these active phases we measure a luminosity of Lx ~ 1043 erg\/s at 2-10 keV. This corresponds to a bolometric luminosity of Lbol ~ 1044 erg\/s assuming a blackbody temperature of kTBB ~ 50-100 eV.

{"text":"Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT) is an important evolutionary force that can increase genetic diversity and accelerate evolution, but it also has negative effects such as disrupting co-adapted gene complexes or introducing deleterious mutations into recipient genomes. In this study we investigate how HGT affects the mean fitness of unicells evolving under different environmental conditions using computational models. We find that HGT increases the mean fitness when cells are exposed to fluctuating environments with high levels of stressful events. However, if there are only mild fluctuations then HGT decreases the mean fitness because it introduces harmful mutations. Finally, for constant environments without any external stresses, HGT does not affect the mean fitness at all. Our results suggest that HGT may have played an important role during early stages of life's evolution by increasing its adaptability to changing environments. Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT), which occurs between organisms sharing similar DNA sequences, is one of the most significant evolutionary forces known today [1] . It allows rapid acquisition of new genes and thus contributes to increased genetic diversity within species [2] , accelerates evolution [3] , and facilitates adaptation [4] .\nHowever, HGT also has some disadvantages including disruption of co-adapted gene complexes [5] and introduction of deleterious mutations [6] . Therefore, understanding the effect of HGT on population dynamics requires careful investigation [7, 8] . Previous studies suggested that HGT could be beneficial for populations living in fluctuating environments [9] while detrimental for those inhabiting stable ones [10] . Here we use computational models to explore these hypotheses further and show that HGT can either increase or decrease the mean fitness depending on the type of environment inhabited by the cell population."}

We show through numerical experiments on synthetic networks that our approach can accurately recover both the structure and parameters of the underlying network even when only partial information about the system is available. Our results also suggest that the performance of the proposed method depends strongly on how well the sparsity pattern of the true signal is captured by the observation matrix.

We find no compelling evidence for such a bimodal distribution using any one method alone; however, when all three methods are combined there is strong evidence for this hypothesis.  The best-fit parameters obtained with each method individually differ significantly and suggest that the true underlying distribution may be more complex than previously thought. In particular, our results indicate that the shortest duration events form their own class of GRBs whose properties are quite different from those of longer-duration GRBs. This result has important implications both for understanding the nature of these phenomena and for planning future missions dedicated to studying them.

We consider two different supermanifolds as target spaces for this model: one is the supersphere and another is the supercoset space $SL(3,R)\/SO(3)$. The latter has been studied by Witten [1] . In both cases we find that there are no tachyons or ghosts at tree level. However, when we calculate the beta functions to one-loop order, we find that they do not vanish even if we take into account all possible counterterms allowed by symmetries. This indicates that these models suffer from perturbative non-renormalizability. On the other hand, it turns out that the theories have exact global symmetry which can be used to construct an infinite number of conserved currents. These currents lead us to propose new Ward identities which relate correlation functions involving operators of different spin."}

{"text":"We report an experimental realization of a novel type of 3D Brownian motors based on colloidal particles trapped in periodic potentials created by laser interference patterns. The potential landscape is engineered to have two different types of local minima separated by barriers with varying heights and widths. We show that this design allows for controlling both directional transport as well as its speed over several orders of magnitude. This work opens up new possibilities for designing active materials with tunable properties. A growing number of applications require systems capable of converting energy into directed motion at low Reynolds numbers [1] . In recent years, there has been significant progress towards realizing such devices known as \"Brownian motors\" [2] , which are typically composed of many interacting particles moving through complex environments [3] .\nIn particular, it was shown theoretically [4] and experimentally [5] that one can create a unidirectional current of colloids using optical traps arranged in a 2D square or honeycomb pattern [6] .

{"text":"We present field-theoretical formulations for modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) and its relativistic generalization, TeVeS. We show that the two theories are equivalent in their weak-field limit but differ significantly at high accelerations. In particular we find that the gravitational potential generated by an isolated point mass is different between the two theories even when they predict identical rotation curves around this object. This difference can be used to test whether or not dark matter exists using observations of galaxy clusters. The equivalence principle states that all local physics should be independent of where it occurs in space-time. However, there exist many extensions to general relativity which violate this principle. One such extension is the so-called scalar-tensor-vector-symmetric theory (STV), also known as TeVeS. STV has been shown to successfully reproduce galactic rotation curves without requiring any additional dark matter component. Here we study how violations of the equivalence principle affect the growth rate of structure formation within the context of STV cosmology."}

This behavior is attributed to the increase of anisotropy energy density near Tc. \n \n In addition, we observed an interesting phenomenon where the coercive fields are strongly dependent on sample thicknesses. For example, the coercivities of FePt(5 nm), FePt(10 nm), and FePt(20 nm) films were measured to be 0.6 T, 1.1 T, and 2.2 T respectively. These values are much higher than those reported previously for bulk materials."}
{"text":"We present an in-depth study of the galaxy cluster Z3146, which is one of the most luminous clusters in X-rays known to date (Lx = 1.5 x 1045 erg\/s). The main goal of this work was to investigate whether or not there are any signatures of AGN activity associated with the central cD galaxy. We have obtained deep optical spectroscopy for more than 100 galaxies within the virial radius of the cluster using the Keck telescope. In addition we have carried out Chandra observations that allow us to resolve individual point sources down to luminosities as low as Lx ~ 3 x 1041 erg\/s. Our results show that:  -The brightest cluster galaxy has a very complex spectrum dominated by emission lines produced by gas ionized by hot stars.  -There is no evidence for significant nuclear activity in the form of broad line regions and\/or high excitation narrow-line regions.  -The total mass profile derived from our spectroscopic data agrees well with previous estimates based on gravitational lensing measurements."}

We show that if the first group is generated by an irrational rotation number then there exists a sequence of elements in the second group which converges to it exponentially fast (in terms of their Lipschitz constants). This result can be viewed as a generalization of the classical Denjoy theorem for circle homeomorphisms. The proof uses techniques developed recently in geometric measure theory such as rectifiability properties of invariant measures under surface diffeomorphisms. In particular we use results due to David Gabai, Richard Hamilton, and Michael Hutchings.

{"text":"The hypercube model is used to describe the evolution of life in terms of its complexity, speed, and stability.  The model shows that there are limits imposed by protein stability on how complex an organism can be as well as how fast it evolves molecularly.   It also suggests that these limits may have been reached during the Cambrian explosion about 540 million years ago when most animal phyla appeared simultaneously. This article describes the hypercube model and presents some examples of how it has been applied to understand evolutionary processes at different levels of organization ranging from genes to ecosystems. In this article we present a new approach for understanding the evolution of life based on the concept of the hypercube (1). We argue that the evolution of life can be described in three dimensions: complexity, speed, and stabilization. These three dimensions represent key aspects of biological systems that evolve over time. For example, organisms become more complex through the addition of new components such as organs or tissues; they evolve faster if their genetic variation increases; and they become more stable if mutations do not cause them to die prematurely. Figure 1 illustrates our view of the evolution of life using the hypercube model. Each vertex represents one possible state of living matter with respect to each dimension. As shown in Fig. 1A , the number of vertices along any given axis depends on the level of resolution chosen. At higher resolutions, the number of states increases exponentially. For instance, if we consider only two states per dimension\u2014simple versus complex, slow versus fast, unstable versus stable\u2014the total number of possible combinations would be four (2 x 2 x 2 = 8), which corresponds to eight types of living matter. However, if we increase the resolution so that we now include four states per dimension\u2014very simple versus simple versus complex versus very complex, very slow versus slow versus fast versus very fast,..."}
{"text":"We consider an electrically charged dust ball in the background of a static spherically symmetric black hole with charge Q and mass M . We show that if the charge is sufficiently large, then there exists no trajectory for which the dust ball can escape to infinity. The result holds even when we allow the charge on the dust ball to vary along its world line. This suggests that it may not be possible to send information across such a wormhole using this method. Introduction:-In recent years, several authors have studied traversable Lorentzian wormholes (see [1] - [4] ). These are hypothetical shortcuts between distant regions of spacetime whose existence would violate causality unless certain conditions are satisfied [5] , namely, the weak energy condition [6] or the averaged null energy condition [7] must hold at least locally around the throat of the wormhole [8] .\nThe simplest example of a traversable wormhole is known as the Morris-Thorne wormhole [9] . It consists of two asymptotically flat spacetimes connected by a throat region called the bridge. In order to maintain the wormhole open, one requires exotic matter [10] satisfying the strong energy condition [11] but violating the dominant energy condition [12] . However, it has been shown [13] that these requirements cannot be met within classical general relativity [14] ."}
{"text":"We present an algorithm for computing the semidefinite representation (SDR) of convex sets in arbitrary dimensions, which is based on solving linear programs with polynomial number of constraints and variables. The SDR can be used to solve many problems that are NP-hard or even undecidable by reducing them into tractable convex optimization problems. We show how this approach can be applied to several important computational problems such as finding Nash equilibria in games, learning graphical models, and approximating mixed integer programming problems. Finally we discuss some open questions related to our work. Semidefinite representations provide a powerful tool for solving hard computational problems via convex optimization. In particular they allow us to reduce intractable problems like finding Nash equilibria in multiplayer games, learning graphical models and approximating mixed-integer programming problems to tractable convex optimization problems. \n \n This talk will give an overview over recent results on algorithms for computing semidefinite representations of convex sets. It will also explain how these techniques can be applied to various computational problems."}

{"text":"We present an analysis of the statistical properties of turbulent flows that are driven by random forcing and decaying viscosity, with particular emphasis on their departures from Gaussianity. We show how these statistics can be computed using a recently developed method based on stochastic averaging over realizations of the flow field. The results obtained demonstrate that this approach is capable of capturing both non-Gaussian tails as well as intermittency effects associated with small-scale structures. In addition to providing new insights into the nature of turbulence, our findings also have important implications for the development of efficient numerical algorithms aimed at solving fluid dynamics problems. Turbulence plays a crucial role in many physical phenomena ranging from geophysical flows [1] , atmospheric convection [2] , oceanic currents [3] , plasma physics [4] , combustion [5] , and even stock market fluctuations [6] . Despite its ubiquity, however, there remains no universally accepted theory describing the underlying mechanisms responsible for the observed phenomenology [7, 8] .\nIn recent years, significant progress has been made towards understanding the statistical properties of turbulences through direct numerical simulations (DNS) [9] . These studies have shown that the probability density functions (PDFs) of velocity differences exhibit heavy-tailed distributions [10] which cannot be described within the framework of classical statistical mechanics [11] . Moreover, it was found that PDFs of higher-order moments such as energy dissipation rates [12] or enstrophy [13] display power-law scaling behavior near their peaks indicating strong intermittency [14] . This phenomenon manifests itself in the form of bursty events where large values of certain quantities occur simultaneously [15] . It should be noted, however, that DNS-based approaches suffer from severe limitations due to high computational costs involved [16] . As a result, they are typically restricted to relatively low Reynolds numbers [17] making them inapplicable to real-world applications [18] ."}
{"text":"We study the dynamics of open quantum systems in one dimension, focusing on their ability to generate entanglement between distant sites and how this is affected by decoherence.  We consider two different models for the system-environment interaction: (i) an environment that couples locally with each site; and (ii) an environment that couples globally with all sites simultaneously. In both cases we find that there are regimes where the system can be driven into highly entangled states even when it starts out unentangled or only weakly entangled. This occurs because the environment acts as a source of noise which drives the system towards its ground state. The effect of local coupling is more pronounced than global coupling since the former allows for faster relaxation timescales. Finally, we show that these results hold true also if the initial state has some degree of spatial correlations. Quantum information processing requires the manipulation of quantum states over large distances. However, due to inevitable interactions with the surrounding environment, such operations cannot be performed perfectly. Here we investigate whether certain types of environments may actually enhance the performance of quantum devices."}
{"text":"The distance geometry problem is the following: given n points in space, find their coordinates such that they are as close to each other as possible while respecting some constraints on distances between pairs of points.  In this work we consider an application of the distance geometry problem to music analysis and propose a novel method for automatic transcription of musical scores into symbolic representations based on the concept of pitch class profiles (PCP). The proposed approach allows us to recover the underlying harmonic structure of polyphonic music by solving a system of quadratic equations with linear equality constraints using convex optimization techniques. We demonstrate our algorithm's performance on several classical piano pieces. 1 Introduction\n\nMusic Analysis\nAutomatic transcription of musical scores has been one of the most challenging problems in computer science over the past decades. It consists of recovering the underlying harmonic structure of a piece of music from its audio signal or MIDI file. This task can be divided into two main subtasks:  detection of note onset times; estimation of pitches at detected notes' locations. Note onset time detection is usually performed by applying various heuristics to the raw audio data [22, 23] . Once the note onset times have been determined, the next step is to estimate the pitches corresponding to these events. There exist many different approaches to solve this problem ranging from simple template matching methods to more sophisticated statistical models [7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19-21, 24-26] .\nIn this work we focus on the second part of the problem -estimation of pitches-which is known as \"pitch estimation\" or \"pitch tracking\". Pitch tracking algorithms try to assign a pitch value to every detected event in order to obtain a sequence of pitch values which correspond to the original score. A common way to represent pitches is through so-called pitch-class profiles (PCPs) [6, 12, 15, 18, 27] , where each entry corresponds to the number of occurrences of a particular pitch within a certain window around the current time instant. For example, Figure 1 shows a typical PCP obtained from a single-note mel"}

{"text":"We present an analytical theory for the low-frequency (1\/f) spin-noise power spectrum in disordered semiconductor-oxide interfaces, which is dominated by dangling bond spins at the oxide\/semiconductor interface. The model takes into account both electron-phonon scattering processes that lead to spin dephasing as well as phonon-assisted tunneling between localized states near the Fermi level. We show that this leads to a characteristic temperature dependence of the 1\/\u0192-noise amplitude with two distinct regimes separated by a crossover temperature T*. Below T* we find a linear increase of the noise amplitude with decreasing temperature, while above T* it decreases exponentially. This behavior can be explained within our model using only one fitting parameter, namely the density of dangling bonds at the interface. Our results are consistent with recent experiments on SiO2\/Si-interfaces. \n \n Introduction \n \n In recent years there has been growing interest in understanding the origin of the ubiquitous 1\/f noise observed in many different physical systems ranging from electronic devices [1] over biological [2] to geological [3] ones. While its microscopic origins remain unclear [4] , several theoretical models have been proposed [5-7] . Among these, the so-called \"disordered semiconductor-oxide interface model\" [8] provides a simple explanation for the experimentally observed universal scaling properties [9] of the noise amplitude A(T), i.e., the fact that A(T) ~ T-1\/2 below some crossover temperature T* and decays exponentially above T* [10] . However, so far no detailed quantitative comparison between experiment and theory exists [11] .\n \nIn this Letter we provide such a comparison based on a generalization of the original model [12] taking into account phonon-assisted tunnel transitions between localized states close to the Fermi energy [13] .

The number of qubits communicated between neighboring nodes does not exceed O(log n), where n is the size of the network.  2. Each node performs at most polylogarithmic many local operations. Our result implies that if we allow unlimited amount of entanglement then it suffices to use only logarithmic amount of classical communication per edge.

In both cases we assume azimuthal symmetry about the central star. Our main goal is to study how the presence of magnetic fields affects the motion of solids through the disk. To this end, we consider three different initial field configurations: (a) purely toroidal, (b) purely poloidal, and (c) mixed toroidal-poloidal. For each configuration, we perform several runs varying the strength of the initial magnetic field."}

{"text":"We present new observations of the nuclear region in the nearby radio galaxy NGC315, made using the Chandra X-ray Observatory (CXO) and the Very Large Array (VLA). The CXO data reveal an unresolved point source at the center of this elliptical galaxy that is surrounded by diffuse emission extending to about 1 arcmin (3 kpc), which we identify as thermal gas heated by the central AGN. We detect two bright knots embedded within the extended emission; these are likely associated with shocks driven into the surrounding medium by the expanding radio jets. Using high-resolution VLA images obtained simultaneously with the CXO observation, we find evidence for a one-sided parsec-scale radio jet emerging from the nucleus along position angle PA = -45 degrees.

In particular we find that there is no restriction to the mass parameter M0 appearing in the solution of the vacuum Einstein equation on the brane. The corresponding horizon radius r0 satisfies the relation r0 = (3M0\/4\u03c0)1\/3.

However, we also find that this may not always happen because some users may try to hoard money while others may act altruistically. In particular, we consider two types of user behavior: selfishness and altruism. Selfish users maximize their utility at each transaction; they will accept only offers that give them more than what they pay out. Altruistic users do not care about maximizing their individual utilities but rather want to make sure that everyone gets paid as much as possible. We analyze these behaviors using game-theoretic models and derive conditions under which both selfish and altruistic users behave fairly."}

{"text":"The concept of dynamical 3-space is introduced in this review article as an alternative to the standard space-time picture of relativistic physics. The main idea behind it is that, instead of considering time and space separately, one should consider them together as a single entity called \"dynamical 3-space\". This new approach has several advantages over the traditional viewpoint; for example, it provides a natural explanation for why we experience time flow only forward (and not backward), while at the same time allowing us to preserve causality. In addition, it also allows us to explain how particles can travel faster than light without violating any physical laws. Finally, by introducing the concept of \"quantum potential energy density\" into our description of matter fields, we are able to provide a simple mathematical framework within which all known fundamental interactions between elementary particles may be described. We conclude with some remarks on possible future research directions based upon this novel theoretical perspective."}
{"text":"The cosmological electroweak phase transition is now known to be first order, and it has been suggested that this may have important consequences for baryogenesis in the early universe.  In contrast, there are no compelling theoretical reasons why the analogous quantum chromodynamics (QCD) phase transition should also be first-order.   Here we argue that if the QCD phase transition were indeed second-order then it would lead to an unacceptably large number density of topological defects such as monopoles or cosmic strings at late times.  We show how these constraints can be satisfied by introducing new physics into the Standard Model which leads to a strongly first-order phase transition with a critical temperature T_c ~ 100 GeV. The cosmological electroweak phase tran-sition is now known to be of first order [1] , and it has been suggested [2] that this could have important consequences for baryogensis in the early universe.

If the QCD phase transition was instead second-order [5] , then it would lead to unacceptable numbers [6] of topological defects [7, 8] such as monopoles [9] or cosmic strings [10] .

{"text":"We study the diameter and clustering coefficient for several classes of random graphs with power law degree distribution, including preferential attachment (PA) networks.  We show that PA networks have small diameters if their growth is slow enough; this result holds even when we allow multiple edges between nodes. For fast growing PA networks, however, there are examples where the diameter grows exponentially as a function of n. In addition to studying the diameter, we also consider the clustering coefficient of these networks. The clustering coefficient measures how well connected neighbors of a node are among themselves. We prove upper bounds on the clustering coefficients of PA networks which hold regardless of the rate at which new nodes join the network. Finally, we present some numerical results showing that our theoretical predictions agree very well with simulations. Keywords: Preferential Attachment Networks; Diameter; Clustering Coefficient. 1 Introduction Random graphs with power-law degree distributions arise naturally in many applications such as social networks [1] , Internet topology [2] , citation networks [3] , etc.. These types of networks can be generated by using various mechanisms known as \"network growth models\"; see [4] for an overview. One popular model is called \"preferential attachment\" or \"Power-Law Graphs\" [5] . This class of networks has been studied extensively over the past decade [6] - [8] .\nIn this work, we focus on two important properties of these graphs: the diameter and the clustering coefficient [9] . The diameter D(G) of a graph G = (V, E) is defined as max{d(u, v) | u, v \u2208 V }, i.e., it is the maximum distance between any pair of vertices in G. The clustering coefficient C(v) of a vertex v is defined as the fraction of pairs of neighbors of v that are adjacent to each other [10] . It is easy to verify that both quantities depend only on the degrees of the nodes in the graph [11] ; hence they do not change under edge rewirings [12] ."}
{"text":"We present an explicit construction for the CKM matrix, VCKM, in terms of the neutrino mixing matrices UPMNS and UMNS. The latter are defined as unitary transformations that diagonalize the Majorana mass matrices MPMNS and MMNS respectively. We show how this mapping can be used to derive relations between observables associated with quarks and leptons. In particular we find that the Jarlskog invariant JCPV is related to the lepton CP violating phase $\\Delta$ by $JCPV = 2 \\Delta \\cos(2 \\theta_{13})$ where $\\theta_{13}$ denotes the Cabibbo angle. This relation holds independently of whether or not there exists a Dirac CP violating phase in the PMNS matrix. Furthermore it allows us to relate the quark and lepton unitarity triangles. Finally we discuss possible implications on models beyond the Standard Model. Introduction: It has been known since the work of Kobayashi-Maskawa [1] , that the observed pattern of flavor changing neutral currents (FCNCs), which occur at tree level in the standard model (SM), requires new physics contributions [2] . These FCNC processes have so far only been observed within experimental uncertainties consistent with SM predictions [3] .\nIn order to explain these results one usually assumes that the underlying theory respects some form of approximate symmetry [4] . One possibility would be to assume that the Yukawa couplings respect such symmetries [5] . However, if the fermion masses arise through spontaneous breaking of global symmetries [6] then the resulting effective Lagrangian will contain higher dimensional operators [7] . Such operators may induce large effects in FCNC processes [8] . Alternatively, one could consider extensions of the SM gauge group [9] ."}
{"text":"We consider the possibility that dark matter is made up of bosonic particles, which can condense into a superfluid state at low temperatures. We show how this scenario could explain several puzzling observations in astrophysics and cosmology. In particular we argue that: (i) The observed flat rotation curves of spiral galaxies are explained by the presence of a halo of cold dark matter surrounding each galaxy. (ii) The formation of large-scale structures such as clusters of galaxies proceeds through gravitational collapse of overdensities in the primordial density field seeded by quantum fluctuations during inflation. (iii) Dark energy may arise naturally if the universe contains a large number of weakly interacting massive particles with masses around $10^{22}$ GeV.

For more information see http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/quant-ph\/0604070 . \nIntroduction:  Many theories beyond the Standard Model predict new types of elementary particles whose existence has yet to be confirmed experimentally. One particularly interesting class of models involves so-called WIMPZILLAs [1] , i.e., stable relic particles with masses around $10^9$ GeV or higher [2] . These particles would have been produced thermally in the early Universe but their abundance today should still be determined by their annihilation cross section [3] .\nIn this Letter we propose an alternative explanation for the origin of dark matter based on the idea that it consists of self-gravitating bosons [4] . Boson stars [5] are gravitationally bound states of scalar fields [6] predicted by many extensions of the Standard Model [7, 8] . They were first studied in the context of supersymmetric grand unified theories [9] where they play the role of solitonic solutions [10] . More recently, boson stars have also been considered within the framework of string theory [11] . If these objects exist then they will form a population of compact remnants [12] that might constitute all or some fraction of the dark matter [13] ."}
{"text":"We present the first two-dimensional kinematics for both stars and gas in the central kiloparsecs (kpc) of two nearby galaxies, NGC 3227 and NGC 4151. The stellar kinematics are derived from near-infrared integral field spectroscopy obtained with SINFONI on VLT\/UT4. We use these data to construct dynamical models that include contributions from both stars and gas. Our results show that the mass distribution is dominated by dark matter within 1 kpc radius in both cases. However, we find evidence for an additional component of hot ionized gas at large radii in NGC 4151 which may be associated with outflows driven by nuclear activity.

{"text":"We present new observations at 1.4 GHz with the VLA of polarized emission from the nearby (7 Mpc) grand-design spiral galaxy NGC 6946. The data reveal several interesting features that are not seen in previous radio continuum studies of this galaxy. We find that:  -The total intensity distribution is dominated by two bright nuclear components separated by about 2 kpc along an axis perpendicular to the main galactic disk.  -There is no evidence for large-scale ordered fields on kiloparsec scales as previously reported.   -The polarization vectors show a clear pattern of alternating directions across the central region of the galaxy which we interpret as a signature of a global magnetic field reversal between the two nuclei.  -The rotation measure map shows a ring-like structure around each nucleus where the RM changes sign indicating a change in direction of the line-of-sight component of the magnetic field. This feature may be related to the so-called depolarization rings observed in other galaxies but it could also result from beam smearing effects or from intrinsic Faraday dispersion within the source itself.  -The polarized intensity distribution reveals a number of extended structures including a prominent southern arm extending over more than 10 kpc towards the south-east."}
{"text":"We present the broad-band spectral evolution of the X-ray binary system Sco-X1, which is one of the brightest persistent sources in our Galaxy and has been observed by many satellites over more than three decades. We use data obtained with Suzaku (0.5-10 keV), Swift\/BAT (15-50 keV) and INTEGRAL\/IBIS (20-100 keV). The broadband spectrum can be described well by an absorbed power-law model modified by reflection off cold matter. In addition to this continuum component we find evidence for emission lines at 6.4-6.7 keV that are consistent with fluorescent iron K\u03b1 line emission produced by photoionization of neutral material surrounding the central source.

INTRODUCTORY REMARK\nIn recent years there has been considerable interest in studying the statistical mechanics of systems whose configurations evolve according to stochastic processes [1] . These include models describing diffusion-limited reactions [2] , polymer chains [3] or proteins [4] , colloidal suspensions [5] , etc.. A common feature of these models is that they involve many degrees of freedom evolving under the influence of noise. As a result it becomes extremely difficult to solve them exactly even numerically [6] .\nThe purpose of this work is to present a new method for solving certain classes of stochastic differential equations (SDEs). Our main motivation comes from the study of the statistical properties of flexible polymers [7, 8] . However, the formalism developed here should also prove useful in other areas where SDEs play an important role [9] . For example, it could be used to describe the evolution of stock prices [10] or chemical reaction networks [11] ."}

{"text":"We report on measurements of spin-transfer-torque vector (STTV) in magnetic tunnel junctions with perpendicular anisotropy and in-plane magnetization. The STTV is determined by measuring the current-induced switching field distribution for different directions of an external magnetic field applied along the film plane. We find that the magnitude of the STTV depends strongly on the direction of the external magnetic field, which can be explained by taking into account the dependence of the spin polarization efficiency on the angle between the magnetizations of ferromagnetic electrodes. Our results demonstrate that the measurement of the STTV provides information about the angular dependence of the spin polarization at interfaces between magnetic materials. \n \n Spin transfer torque (STT), arising due to the flow of spin-polarized electrons across a magnetic interface, has been extensively studied both theoretically and experimentally over past decade [1] . In particular, it was shown that the application of a charge current through a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) leads to the reversal of its free layer via the action of the so-called spin-transfer-torque vector [2] , whose components are given by: \n \n where  is the unit vector pointing along the electron's momentum,  is the unit vector pointing in the direction of the local magnetization, , and are the magnitudes of the spin polarization efficiencies at the left and right interfaces respectively, and is the thickness of the MTJ barrier [3] .\n \nIn this work we present experimental data demonstrating how the magnitude of the STTT changes as function of the orientation of the external magnetic field Hext applied parallel to the film plane.

{"text":"We present exact solutions for the electromagnetic field in the presence of spherical particles with arbitrary dielectric functions, including both metals and insulators. We show that these results can be obtained by solving Maxwell's equations using an appropriate Green function approach. The resulting expressions are used to calculate the dispersion relations for surface plasmons (SPs) and surface phonons (SPhPs). In particular we find that SPs exist only when the real part of the dielectric constant is negative while SPhPs exist even if it has positive values. Finally, we compare our results against those obtained within the classical Drude model and discuss their validity limits. Surface plasmons (SPs), which are collective oscillations of conduction electrons at metal-dielectric interfaces, have been extensively studied over many decades [1] . They play important roles in various fields such as optics [2] , electronics [3] , sensing [4] , and catalysis [5] .\nRecently there has also been growing interest in studying surface phonon-polaritons (SPhPs), which are analogous excitations associated with longitudinal acoustic waves [6] . These modes occur not only at surfaces but also inside bulk materials [7, 8] where they may lead to enhanced thermal transport [9] or thermoelectricity [10] . Moreover, SPhPs can couple strongly to light [11] leading to interesting phenomena like superprism [12] and extraordinary transmission [13] effects."}
{"text":"We study controllability properties for the heat equation, the wave equation in one space dimension with Dirichlet boundary conditions, and their finite-difference discretizations on rectangular domains. We prove that these problems are not exactly controllable if the length of the longest side is less than or equal to two times the length of the shortest side. For the case where this ratio is larger we show exact controllability under some additional assumptions on the initial data. The proofs rely on Carleman estimates combined with suitable observability inequalities. These results can be extended to higher dimensions using similar techniques. Controllability questions have been studied extensively over the past decades both theoretically as well as numerically (see e.g., [1] , [4] - [6] ). In particular, it has been shown that many partial differential equations cannot be controlled globally even though they may admit an infinite number of controls. This phenomenon was first observed by J. Lagnese [7] who showed that the linear Schr\u00f6dinger equation with potential $|x|^{-2}$ does not admit any global control function when the spatial domain $\\Omega$ is bounded below by a half-line. Later, Fursikov [8] proved that the same result holds true also for other potentials such as $|x|^{-1}$ and $|x|^{-3\/2}$. More recently, Burq et al.

Our results show that most observed PSRs are likely to be found as members of hierarchical triples rather than isolated double neutron star systems or wide binaries. In particular, we find that:  - Most PSRs should have companions whose mass lies within 0.1 M\u2299 < Mc < 1.0 M\u2299; - Most PSRs should reside in orbits with semi-major axes less than 100 AU; - Most PSRs will not evolve into millisecond pulsars before their second supernova explosion; - Most PSRs may experience significant gravitational wave emission during their lifetimes."}

{"text":"We study the effect of an external magnetic field on the ground state properties in the Hubbard model with next-nearest neighbor hopping and spin-orbit coupling, which is relevant to iron-based superconductors. We show that the magnetic field induces a spontaneous breaking of the time-reversal symmetry at half-filling for any finite value of the spin-orbit coupling strength. The broken symmetry phase has two-fold degenerate energy bands and shows non-Fermi liquid behavior. In addition, we find that there exists another spontaneously-broken-symmetry phase without gapless excitations when the chemical potential lies between the upper and lower band edges. This phase also exhibits non-Fermi liquid behaviors. Finally, we discuss possible experimental consequences of our results. Introduction:-The discovery of high-Tc FeAs-based superconductors [1] has attracted much attention because they are believed to be unconventional [2] . It was found experimentally [3] that these materials have strong spin orbit (SO) interaction [4] , which leads to several interesting phenomena such as nematic order [5] , orbital ordering [6] , and anisotropic magnetoresistance [7] .\nIn this Letter, we consider the following extended Hubbard model: \nwhere c\u2020i\u03c3(ci\u03c3) creates (annihilates) an electron with spin \u03c3 =\u2191 or \u2193 at site i, n\u03b1\u03b2ij= c \u2020 \u03b1ji c \u03b2ji denotes the density matrix element between sites j and i, t represents nearestneighbor hopping amplitude, t' stands for nextnearest-neighbor hopping amplitude, U is the local Coulomb repulsion, \u03bb is the SO coupling constant, \u00b5 is the chemical potential, and B is the applied magnetic field along z-direction.

{"text":"We study the stability of viscous shock waves for an ideal gas with viscosity and heat conduction, using the method of characteristics.  We show that if the initial data are sufficiently small then there exists a unique global solution to this problem which converges exponentially fast as t \u2192 \u221e towards the corresponding inviscid solution (the Rankine-Hugoniot condition). If the initial data have compact support we prove that the solution remains uniformly bounded on any finite time interval [0,T].

{"text":"We present an accurate analytical model for the description of optical precursors in ultrashort laser pulses propagating through dispersive media, which is based on the concept of nonlinear phase modulation by self-phase-modulation (SPM) and cross-phase-modulation (XPM). The proposed approach allows us to describe accurately both the temporal shape as well as the spectral content of these phenomena. We show that this new method can be used to predict the appearance of weak-field coherent optical transience (WFCOT), i.e., the generation of sub-femtosecond bursts of light with high peak power at specific wavelengths within the spectrum of the pulse. This prediction is confirmed experimentally using a Ti:Sapphire femtosecond oscillator operating at 800 nm central wavelength. Finally we demonstrate how our results are relevant for applications such as ultrafast spectroscopy or attosecond science. \n \n Optical precursors have been observed since the early days of ultrafast optics [1\u20133] . They appear when short intense laser pulses propagate through dispersive media like glass fibers [4] , air [5] , water [6] , crystals [7, 8] , etc.. These effects were first explained theoretically by assuming that the propagation of the pulse was governed by the slowly varying envelope approximation [9] . However it has recently become clear that this assumption does not hold true anymore if one wants to explain the details of the experimental observations [10\u201312] .\n \nIn order to overcome this limitation several authors have developed more sophisticated models [13\u201319] . In particular, the so-called generalized nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation (GNLSE) [20, 21] has proven very useful because it takes into account all orders of dispersion [22] , self-steepening [23] , third-order dispersion [24] , Raman scattering [25] , stimulated Brillouin scattering [26] , self-frequency shift [27] , plasma defocusing [28] , gain saturation [29] , and other higher-order effects [30] . \n \nHowever, despite its successes, there still remain some discrepancies between theory and experiment [31] . For example, the GNLSE predicts that the intensity profile of the precursor should always exhibit a smooth bell-shaped structure [32]"}
{"text":"We study gravitational waves produced by curvaton scenario, where the inflaton field is coupled to another scalar field called curvaton which decays into radiation after inflation and produces primordial density fluctuations. We find that the amplitude of gravitational waves generated during inflation can be enhanced if the decay rate of curvaton is large enough compared with Hubble parameter at its decay time. In this case we show that the tensor-to-scalar ratio becomes larger than 0.1 for most values of parameters except when the mass of curvaton is very small or the coupling between inflaton and curvaton fields are extremely suppressed. This result may provide an explanation on why the recent observations give such a high value of tensor-to-scalar ratio. \n \n Introduction \n \n The current observational data [1] strongly suggest that there exists a significant amount of primordial gravitational waves (GWs) in our universe. If confirmed, it will have important implications not only for cosmology but also particle physics [2] . However, the origin of these GWs has been one of the biggest mysteries in modern cosmology [3] .\n \nIn order to explain the observed temperature anisotropies of cosmic microwave background (CMB), many models beyond standard model of particle physics were proposed [4] , among them supersymmetric grand unified theories [5] and supergravity [6] are well known examples. These models predict new particles whose masses lie around 10 16 GeV [7, 8] . It was shown [9] that the existence of such heavy particles could lead to successful inflationary scenarios [10] . On the other hand, the presence of such heavy particles would produce too much gravitons [11] unless their couplings to ordinary matter are highly suppressed [12] . Therefore, it seems difficult to generate sufficient amount of GWs within the framework of these models without conflicting with CMB observation [13] . \n \n Recently, however, several authors [14 -17] suggested that the production of GWs might be possible even though the inflaton does not couple directly to any heavy particles. They considered a situation where the inflaton field couples to another scalar field called \"curvaton\" [18] through non-renormalizable interactions [19, 20] . After"}
{"text":"We study the dynamics of an ensemble of elastically-coupled reed oscillators driven by a common acoustic field, and show that they can exhibit striking phenomena such as synchronized chaos or phase-locked states with multiple incommensurate frequencies. We also demonstrate how these effects are modified when the system is connected to a passive resonator. The results presented here may be relevant to understanding the behavior of biological systems such as colonies of fireflies or neurons. \n \n In recent years there has been growing interest in studying nonlinear dynamical systems composed of many interacting elements [1-3]. These studies have revealed new collective behaviors which cannot occur in single element systems [4] . Examples include synchronization [5-7] , clustering [8] , chimera states [9] , and spatiotemporal patterns [10-12] .\nIn this work we consider a model consisting of N identical elastically-coupled reed-oscillators [13] driven by a common acoustic wavefield [14-16] (see Fig 1) . Each oscillator consists of two vibrating plates separated by a thin layer of air [17] . When the pressure difference across one plate exceeds its critical value, it begins to expand rapidly until the restoring force due to the other plate causes it to contract again. This process repeats periodically resulting in self-sustained oscillations at a frequency determined by the geometry of the device [18] . \nThe coupling between neighboring oscillators arises because each oscillator acts like a small loudspeaker radiating sound into the surrounding medium [19-21] . As a result, nearby oscillators experience similar driving forces and their natural frequencies become locked [22] . If all oscillators lock onto the same frequency then the entire system behaves coherently; if different groups of oscillators lock on to different frequencies then the system exhibits spatially-extended multistability [23] ."}
{"text":"We study stability properties of steady-state solutions to the compressible Navier-Stokes equations with large Mach numbers, and prove that they are stable under small perturbations if their pressure satisfies certain conditions.  We consider two types of steady states: (i) traveling waves which connect different constant states; and (ii) stationary shocks connecting different constant states. For both cases we show that these steady-states are stable for all sufficiently large Mach numbers M > 1 provided that the pressure p(\u03c1) has at most one inflection point on its graph. In particular, this implies that any smooth solution starting close enough to such a steady state converges exponentially fast towards it as time goes to infinity. \nThe proof relies on an energy estimate combined with suitable weighted Sobolev estimates. The main difficulty lies in dealing with the nonlinear term arising from the convection part of the equation. This problem can be overcome by using appropriate weight functions together with some delicate analysis based on the maximum principle."}

{"text":"We present multiwavelength polarimetric observations of fifteen active galactic nuclei (AGNs) made with the Very Large Array and the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array between 5 and 43 GHz, including simultaneous measurements in two bands for eight sources. We find that most AGN show correlated polarization behavior across our frequency range; however, we also identify several cases where this is not true. In particular, we observe significant changes in fractional linear polarization over short timescales as well as large differences in position angle between different frequencies. These results are consistent with previous studies showing rapid variability on small spatial scales within these objects. \n \n Keywords: radio astronomy, active galaxy, polarization, VLBI, VLA, KVNVLA, JVLBA, high-frequency radio emission, jets, blazars \n \n \n \n 1 Introduction \n \n The study of polarized radiation provides important information about magnetic fields in astrophysical environments ranging from planets to galaxies. However, it can be difficult to obtain accurate estimates of the degree of polarization because of instrumental effects such as beam depolarization or calibration errors. This problem becomes more severe when studying faint sources observed at low signal-to-noise ratios. To overcome these difficulties, many authors have used statistical techniques to estimate the intrinsic properties of their sample populations [1\u20133]. For example, Hovatta et al. (2012) [4] studied the distribution of Stokes parameters using Monte Carlo simulations to determine the mean values and standard deviations of the distributions. They found that the average degrees of polarization were typically higher than those reported by other authors who had analyzed similar data sets [5\u20137]. Similarly, Lister & Homan (2005) [8] investigated the polarization properties of bright quasars using a maximum likelihood method to fit Gaussian functions to the Stokes parameter histograms. Their analysis revealed that the majority of quasars exhibited circularly polarized components along with linearly polarized ones."}
{"text":"We have used the Hubble Space Telescope to monitor Eta Carinae for more than two years, and find no evidence that it is about to explode as a super-luminous supernova (SLSN). The lack of any significant brightening in this period suggests that SLSNe are rare events with low duty cycles.  We also show that there has been no change in the luminosity or spectrum of the system since its last major outburst in 1843. This indicates that the current mass loss rate is not sufficient to trigger another eruption on timescales shorter than centuries. Finally we present new near-infrared spectroscopy which shows that the dust shell surrounding the star is expanding at speeds consistent with those expected if the shell was ejected during the previous eruption. These results suggest that Eta Carinae will remain an important source of information into the future. Keywords: Supernovae, Superluminescent"}

{"text":"We present an assessment of the predictive power of galaxy formation models by comparing their predictions for rest-frame optical luminosity functions (LFs) with observations over the redshift range z=2-3. We use two different semi-analytic models, GALFORM and L-GALAXIES, to predict the evolution in number density as well as the distribution of stellar masses and star formation rates of galaxies across this redshift interval. The predicted LF is compared directly against observational data obtained using the Hubble Space Telescope's Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS). In addition we compare the observed and predicted distributions of UV absolute magnitudes and dust-corrected colours. Our results show that both models are able to reproduce the overall shape of the observed LF but underpredict its normalisation by up to a factor of three. This discrepancy can be largely accounted for if one assumes that the majority of faint galaxies have been missed due to incompleteness effects associated with current surveys."}
{"text":"We study the orbital evolution of planets in binaries under the effect of gravitational perturbations due to third bodies, which can lead to large eccentricities and inclinations for both components of the system. We show that this mechanism is able to explain some observed properties of extrasolar systems such as HD 169830 or Kepler-16. In particular we find that it may be responsible for the formation of hot Jupiters through planet-planet scattering processes. The main results are summarized below: \n1) We present an analytical model describing the long-term evolution of the semi-major axes (a), eccentricities (e), and mutual inclination angles (i) of two orbiting objects under the combined effects of general relativity, tides, and secular interactions between all three bodies. \n2) Using our model, we perform numerical integrations of several representative cases showing how the presence of additional perturbative forces can significantly modify the orbital parameters of the innermost body over time-scales ranging from millions up to billions of years. \n\n3) We apply our model to the case of the exoplanetary system around HD 169830 composed of four giant planets on highly inclined orbits. Our calculations suggest that the current architecture of this system could have been produced by successive scatterings among its planets triggered by strong gravitational encounters with other massive bodies located at distances larger than 100 AU. \n \n 4) Finally, we explore the possibility that the recently discovered transiting super-Earths in the Kepler-16 system might also have formed via similar mechanisms."}

These results are consistent with previous estimates based on optical photometry alone.

{"text":"We introduce the notion of ``abstract factorials'', which are functions that can be used to represent and manipulate sets of integers in an efficient manner.  We show how these functions can be implemented using standard data structures such as hash tables or trees.   Finally we present several applications for this new class of objects including fast algorithms for computing the number of integer partitions with bounded parts (the so-called ``Stirling numbers of the second kind'') and for counting the number of ways to tile a rectangular board with tiles of different sizes. The concept of abstract factorials is introduced along with its implementation on top of existing data structures like hash tables or binary search trees. Several applications are presented, among them fast algorithms for computing Stirling numbers of the second type and tiling problems. This work was supported by NSF grant CCF-0634420. 1 Introduction In many computational settings it is necessary to perform operations over large collections of integers. For example, one may need to count the number of ways to partition a set into subsets of equal size, or to compute the number of tilings of a rectangular board with tiles having different shapes and sizes. These computations often require repeated evaluation of arithmetic expressions involving sums and products of integers. It has been shown recently that certain classes of such expressions admit very efficient representations based on combinatorial objects known as ``factorials'' [19, 20] . A factorial is essentially a function that maps each positive integer n to another object f(n), called the ``value'' of the factorial at n. Such values must satisfy two properties:  First, they should form a sequence of nonnegative integers whose sum grows exponentially; i.e., there exists some constant c > 0 so that the value of any factorial satisfies |f(n)| <= cn^c for all sufficiently large n. Second, the values of distinct factorials cannot collide too frequently; more precisely, if f(n1) = f(n2) then n1 and n2 must differ by at least a fixed amount d."}

The truecluster is defined as a set of points in high-dimensional space that are close to each other and far away from all other points in this space.   We show how our method can be used to find the best alignment between two point clouds obtained by different sensors or at different times.   ... \nIntroduction\n\nThe problem addressed here is one of data association - given two sets of observations (e.g., images), determine what pairs correspond to the same physical object.  This problem arises frequently when dealing with multiple views of objects such as those shown in Figure 1 , where it may not always be possible to obtain perfect registration between the two images due to calibration errors, occlusions, etc.\n\nIn many applications, there exists some prior knowledge about the correspondence between the two sets of observations;  e.g., if they were taken using the same sensor but at different times, then their relative pose will be known up to a scale factor.  In these cases, the goal becomes to use this information to improve the accuracy of the final solution.  \n\nOur approach relies on the concept of a \"truecluster\":   A truecluster is a set of points in a high dimensional space whose members are close together while being far apart from any other points in the space.  For example, consider the case of registering two images of a scene containing several people standing next to each other.  Each person forms its own truecluster since his\/her appearance does not change significantly over time.  On the other hand, the background changes dramatically so no single cluster corresponds to the entire background region. \n\nGiven two sets of trueclusters corresponding to the first and second observation respectively, we want to find the optimal assignment between them.  To do this, we define a cost function based on the distances between the points within each truecluster pair.  Then, we formulate the problem as a quadratic integer program and solve it efficiently using branch-and-bound techniques.  Finally,..."}
{"text":"We present an explanation for the excess in gamma-ray emission observed by the Energetic Gamma Ray Experiment Telescope (EGRET) at energies above 10 GeV, which is known as the \"GeV anomaly\". We show that this excess can be explained if there are two populations of pulsars with different magnetic field strengths. The first population consists of young pulsars whose fields decay rapidly due to their rapid spin-downs. These pulsars produce most of the high-energy photons detected by EGRET. The second population consists of older pulsars whose fields have decayed more slowly because they rotate slower than younger pulsars on average. This second population produces less high-energy radiation but contributes significantly to the total number of pulsars. Our model predicts that Fermi should detect many new pulsar candidates not seen before. In addition, we predict that some of these newly discovered pulsars will exhibit very high luminosities compared to other pulsars."}
{"text":"The projectile fragmentation of 86Kr at 64MeV\/nucleon has been studied with the INDRA multidetector in inverse kinematics using an 8cm thick natK target and a beam intensity of 1nAe.

This indicates that the fragments produced by the break-up of 86Kr are not only light particles like neutrons or protons, but contain many intermediate mass fragments too.   - The angular distributions show two peaks corresponding to forward and backward emission respectively (see fig.2 ).  - The energy spectra present a maximum around 10-12 MeV\/u which corresponds to the most probable kinetic energy per nucleon of the emitted fragments (see fig.3 ).\n- The isotopic composition of the fragments is shown on figure 4 .

{"text":"The observed smallness of the vacuum energy density is one of the most puzzling problems in physics today, and it has been suggested that this problem may be solved by considering quantum gravity effects on the vacuum fluctuations.  In this work we show how such an effect can arise naturally within the context of loop quantum gravity (LQG). We consider a model where the gravitational field is quantized using LQG techniques while matter fields are treated classically. The resulting effective action contains terms which depend explicitly on the scale factor of the universe as well as its time derivatives. These terms lead to corrections to the standard Friedmann equations at high energies. Using these modified equations together with observational data we find that the present day value of the vacuum energy density agrees very well with observations if the initial conditions are chosen appropriately. This result suggests that our approach provides a natural solution to the cosmological constant problem. The observed smallness of the cosmological constant poses one of the greatest challenges facing modern theoretical physics [1] . It is generally believed that quantum gravity will play an important role in understanding why the vacuum energy density associated with quantum fluctuations of all fields is so much smaller than what would naively be expected [2] .\nIn recent years there have been several attempts to address this issue within the framework of loop quantum gravity [3] - [8] , but none of them seem to provide a satisfactory answer [9] . In particular, the results obtained in Refs. [6] - [8] do not agree with each other or with current experimental bounds [10] . Here we propose a new mechanism based on ideas developed recently in Ref. [11] . Our starting point is the observation that the Wheeler-DeWitt equation derived from the canonical formulation of general relativity leads to modifications of the usual Schr\u00f6dinger equation when applied to states describing macroscopic systems [12] . As shown in Ref. [13] , these modifications can be interpreted as arising due to the presence of additional degrees of freedom corresponding to the gravitational field itself."}
{"text":"We study the sound propagation through a one-dimensional (1D) Bose-Einstein condensed gas trapped by an optical lattice potential and interacting with each other via contact interactions. We show that, for weak interaction strength, there is no phonon-phonon scattering between different bands due to the energy gap induced by the periodic potential. In this case, we find that the sound velocity can be obtained analytically using perturbation theory. For strong interaction strengths, however, the phonons are scattered into higher bands and thus the sound velocity decreases as compared to its non-interacting value. The results agree well with numerical calculations based on the Gross-Pitaevskii equation. PACS numbers: 03.75.Dg, 05.30.Jp, 37.10.Gh \nI. INTRODUCTIO N\nThe properties of superfluid helium have been studied extensively since it was discovered more than half century ago [1] . One of the most important features of superfluids is their ability to support dissipationless flow without friction [2] , which has led to many applications such as superconductors [3] .\nRecently, ultracold atomic gases confined in optical lattices provide another platform to explore quantum fluids [4] . These systems exhibit various phases including Mott insulator phase [5] , supersolid phase [6] , and even topological states [7, 8] . Moreover, they allow us to tune the system parameters continuously [9] and observe directly the evolution of physical quantities [10] . This makes them ideal candidates to investigate new phenomena predicted by theoretical studies [11] .\nIn particular, bosonic atoms in optical lattices may form a BoseEinstein condensate [12] . It is known that these condensates behave like superfluids [13] . Recently, several experiments have observed the superflow [14] and vortex [15] in these systems. However, unlike conventional superfluids, the condensates in optical lattices also interact strongly with each other [16] . Therefore, understanding how the interatomic interactions affect the collective excitations becomes crucial [17] .\nIn this work, we consider 1D Bose-Einstein condensates trapped by an optical lattice [18] .

{"text":"We study the problem of reconstructing evolutionary histories that contain both reticulation events and vertical transmission, where reticulations are represented by hybridization or horizontal gene transfer (HGT). We show how to use maximum parsimony to find an optimal solution for this problem in polynomial time when all input trees have bounded degree. This is achieved through a novel dynamic programming algorithm which computes the minimum number of reticulation events needed to explain each set of taxa on every tree in the input collection. Our approach can be used as part of a larger method for inferring species networks using collections of rooted binary phylogenies inferred from different types of data such as DNA sequences, morphological characters, fossil records etc., and it may also provide insights into the evolution of complex organisms like viruses and bacteria. \nIntroduction\n\nThe reconstruction of evolutionary relationships among biological entities has been one of the central problems in biology since Darwin's On the Origin of Species was published 150 years ago [1] . The most widely accepted model of evolution assumes that new species evolve over time via vertical transmission -that is, they pass their genetic material down directly from parent to offspring [2] .\nHowever, there are many cases where we cannot assume that evolution proceeds strictly vertically; instead, some form of horizontal gene transfer (HG T) occurs between two lineages [3] , resulting in what is known as reticulate evolution [4] . For example, if a virus infects a bacterium, then its genes will be passed horizontally across the host cell membrane [5] ; similarly, if a plant hybridizes with another plant [6] , then the offspring inherits genetic material from both parents [7, 8] . In these examples, the process of HGT results in a network-like relationship between the descendants of the original ancestor(s), rather than a strict hierarchy [9] ."}
{"text":"We study scale-free avalanche dynamics in the multifractality regime of the Random Walk (RW) on complex networks, by means of numerical simulations and analytical calculations. We show that the probability distribution function P(s) of avalanche sizes s follows a power law with an exponent close to -2 for all values of the parameter q characterizing the degree of multifractality. The scaling behavior is confirmed also by analyzing the temporal evolution of the number N(t) of active nodes at time t during the spreading process. Finally we discuss how our results can be applied to model real-world phenomena characterized by self-organized criticality such as earthquakes or forest fires. Complex systems are often described by models exhibiting Self-organized Criticality (SOC), i.e., they evolve spontaneously towards states where small perturbations may trigger large events [1] . In this context, SOC has been observed in many natural processes ranging from earthquakes [2] , solar flares [3] , landslides [4] , forest fires [5] , neuronal activity [6] up to stock market fluctuations [7, 8] .\nIn order to reproduce these features, several theoretical approaches have been proposed [9] . Among them, one of the most popular is based on the concept of Multifractals [10] : it consists in considering a system whose state variables follow a statistical distribution which exhibits non-trivial scaling properties over different scales [11] . This approach was first introduced in [12] to describe the statistics of energy dissipation rates in turbulent flows; then it was extended to other fields including finance [13] , seismology [14] , biology [15] and social sciences [16] .\nThe simplest way to introduce multifractality into a dynamical system is through the so-called Random Walk (RW). Indeed, if the walker jumps between sites following a L\u00e9vy-like distribution [17] , its trajectory will exhibit fractal properties [18] . Moreover, when the RW is performed on top of a network [19, 20] , the resulting diffusion process displays anomalous transport [21] . Recently, the combination of both concepts -multifractality and networks-has led to interesting applications [22] . For example, in [23] the authors"}
{"text":"We present an alternative description of the electron in terms of its position and velocity, which is based on the idea that it moves along a helical trajectory around the nucleus. The new approach leads to a simple analytical expression for the energy levels of the helium atom as well as for the wave functions corresponding to these states. We show how this model can be used to explain some experimental results obtained by high-resolution spectroscopy experiments performed at Jefferson Lab. In addition we discuss possible extensions of our work towards other atomic systems such as muonic atoms or ions with one valence electron. Helium has been studied extensively over many decades both experimentally and theoretically. It was found that there are two stable isotopes (3He and 4He) and several excited states. These states have been investigated using various spectroscopic techniques including photo-absorption [1] , laser excitation [2] , and Compton scattering [3] . However, despite all efforts made so far, no satisfactory explanation exists yet about why the ground state of 3He is unbound while the ground state of 4He is bound [4] .\nIn order to understand better the structure of helium, we propose here a new theoretical framework where the electron is described not only by its usual position but also by its velocity vector. This new approach allows us to obtain analytically the energy spectrum of helium as well as the associated wavefunctions. Our formalism is inspired by the so-called Bohmian mechanics [5] , which describes particles moving along trajectories instead of following classical equations of motions [6] ."}
{"text":"We show that the coherence property for monadic second-order logic (MSO) over graphs is not equivalent to the existence of an MSO-unique normal form, answering a question raised by Courcelle and Engelfriet in 1990.  We also prove that this result holds even if we restrict our attention to finite trees or forests with bounded degree. This answers another open problem posed by Courcelle and Makowsky in 1991. Finally, we give examples showing that these results are optimal. The main tool used here is a new technique called tree-expansion which allows us to reduce questions about infinite structures to questions about finite ones. Monadic second-order logic (or MSO-logic) has been studied extensively since its introduction in the 1960s as a generalization of first-order logic. It was shown early on that it can express many interesting properties such as connectivity, planarity, and Hamiltonicity. In particular, MSO-formulas define exactly those sets definable in existential monadic second-order logic, i.e., the class of all sets definable using quantification only over subsets of vertices."}
{"text":"We present an effective theory to describe the dynamics of trapped few-fermion systems in the presence of strong interactions and external fields, such as magnetic or optical traps.  The formalism is based on the expansion of the fermionic field operators into eigenfunctions of the single-particle Hamiltonian with appropriate boundary conditions at spatial infinity. We show that this approach leads naturally to the concept of generalized density matrices which are used to calculate expectation values of observables. In particular we discuss how one can obtain information about the system's energy spectrum by calculating matrix elements of the form $\\langle \\hat{O} | \\hat{\\psi}(t) | \\hat{O}\\rangle$ where $|\\hat{\\psi}(0)\\rangle = |n_1 n_2 \\rangle$ denotes the initial state of the system and $|\\hat{O} \\rangle$ represents some operator acting on the Hilbert space of the system.

The formation of Uranus requires additional processes such as ice condensation to explain its high density.

{"text":"We perform numerical simulations for stellar core collapse to investigate how black hole progenitors are formed in nature, especially focusing on their iron cores. We find that there is no progenitor model which can form a black hole directly without forming an intermediate neutron star. The final fate depends strongly on the mass of the iron core at bounce M_fc. For M_fc>20M_sun , we obtain successful explosions by using the delayed neutrino heating mechanism. On the other hand, for M_fc<10M_sun , all models result in failed supernovae because they do not have enough energy to revive stalled shock waves. In between these two cases ( 10M_sun <M_fc< 20M_sun ), some models lead to successful explosions while others fail depending on the initial rotation rate of stars. Our results suggest that most massive stars may explode as normal supernovae but less massive ones may end up as failed supernovae or collapsars."}
{"text":"We study resonant spin polarization (RSP) in a two-dimensional hole gas with Rashba spin-orbit interaction by solving the Kohn-Sham equations within density functional theory. We show that RSP is strongly affected by the presence of the Luttinger parameter, which describes the strength of electron-electron interactions. In particular we find that for large values of the Luttinger parameters the magnitude of RSP decreases significantly due to an increase in the effective mass of holes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that RSP can be controlled by applying external electric fields perpendicular to the plane of the 2D hole gas. Finally, we discuss how our results are related to recent experiments on GaAs quantum wells. The effect of the Luttinger terms, structural inversion asymmetry (SIA), and Zeeman splitting on resonant spin polarization (RS P ) has been studied using density functional theory. It was found that RS P is suppressed when the Luttinger parameter increases because it leads to larger effective masses. Moreover, it was shown that RS P can be tuned by applying external electric fields normal to the plane of the two-dimensional hole gas. Our results were compared to experimental data obtained recently on GaAs quantum wells. \n \n Resonant spin polarization (R SP ), i.e., the generation of a nonequilibrium spin population at zero magnetic field via optical excitation into a heavy-hole exciton resonance, has attracted considerable interest over the past years [1\u20133] . This phenomenon occurs if the energy difference between the conduction band minimum and the valence band maximum lies below the photon energy of the exciting laser light [4] , as illustrated schematically in Fig. 1(a). Due to this condition, electrons excited into the conduction band have a finite probability of being scattered back into the valence band before they relax radiatively or nonradiatively [5] . If these electrons return to their original state after scattering, then they will carry away angular momentum [6] . As a result, the total angular momentum of the system becomes imbalanced [7 ] .\n \n \n Recently, several groups reported measurements of R SP [8 \u201310] ."}

We show that if the initial data is sufficiently concentrated then there exists a unique global solution which converges exponentially fast as time goes to infinity towards a stationary state consisting of two Dirac masses located on opposite sides of the origin. This result can be seen as a generalization of the classical theorem due to J. L. Lions concerning the existence of solutions to the steady-state problem associated with the celebrated Keller-Segel system describing chemotaxis phenomena. In addition we prove that this convergence takes place even when the total number of bacteria initially present is less than the critical value predicted by the theory developed by S. Chandrasekhar in order to explain the stability of white dwarfs against gravitational collapse."}
{"text":"We present an algorithm for generating new solutions to the coupled Einstein-scalar field equations, starting from vacuum solutions and adding scalar fields in such a way that the resulting solution is minimally coupled.  The method can be used to generate exact solutions which are not known explicitly or only implicitly as functions of some parameters (e.g., by solving algebraic equations). We illustrate our approach on several examples including Schwarzschild-de Sitter black holes, Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m-anti-de Sitter black holes, Kerr-Newman-AdS black holes, and charged dilatonic black holes. In particular we show how one can obtain explicit expressions for the massless limit of these black hole solutions. Our results may also have applications beyond gravity theory, e.g., in quantum mechanics where they could provide insight into the structure of bound states. Introduction: Exact solutions play an important role in theoretical physics because they allow us to test various physical ideas against concrete predictions. However, finding exact solutions to physically interesting problems often turns out to be very difficult. For example, it took more than 100 years after the discovery of general relativity before the first exact black hole solutions were found [1-3]. Even today there exist many open questions about black holes [4] . One reason why finding exact solutions is so challenging is that most theories of interest do not admit any simple analytic solutions. Another problem arises when trying to find solutions describing systems with multiple interacting components like black holes surrounded by matter or other fields. Here one usually has to solve complicated differential equations numerically which makes it hard to find all possible solutions even if their existence was guaranteed theoretically. This situation becomes particularly severe if one wants to study phenomena at strong coupling since then numerical methods become less reliable due to large corrections arising from higher orders in perturbation theory."}
{"text":"The relationship between Einstein's work in physics, his personal life, and the cultural milieu of the time is examined through an analysis of his correspondence with Max Born (1882-1970). The letters reveal that Einstein was interested not only in science but also in literature, music, theatre, and other forms of culture. In particular, they show how he came to appreciate modernist artists such as Wassily Wassilyevich Kandinsky, Paul Klee, and Pablo Picasso. They also provide insight into Einstein's attitude towards society at large during this period. This article examines the relationship between Einstein's work on relativity theory, his private life, and the cultural context of the times by analyzing his correspondence with Max Born . It shows that Einstein was interested not just in science but also in various forms of culture including literature, music, theater, and painting.

{"text":"We present the results of first-principles calculations for structural, electronic, magnetic properties of LaMnO3 in its rhombohedral phase (R3c). We show that the local spin density approximation (LSDA) fails to reproduce correctly both the lattice constants and the band gap energy. The latter is underestimated by more than one order of magnitude as compared with experiment. In contrast, our self-consistent full-potential linearized augmented plane wave method gives good agreement between calculated and experimental values of these quantities. \n \n To understand better the origin of this discrepancy we have performed additional calculations using an effective tight-binding approach based on Wannier functions obtained within the framework of the LSDA+U formalism. Our analysis shows that the main reason why the LSDA fails to describe properly the electronic structure of LaMnO3 is due to strong hybridization effects which are not taken into account adequately within the standard LSDA scheme."}

For typical parameters expected near the polar cap region of a pulsar we show that both instabilities can grow rapidly enough to be important for particle acceleration processes at the stellar surface. \n \n Keywords: Plasma physics; Kinetic theory; Instability; Pulsar emission mechanism; Acceleration mechanisms; Mirror instability; Firehose instability; Polar cap acceleration; Magnetosphere; Neutrino emission; Magnetic reconnection; Force-free magnetohydrodynamics; Astrophysics"}
{"text":"We study the holographic entanglement entropy for three-dimensional de Sitter space with gravitational Chern-Simons term by using the replica trick and the covariant phase-space method. We find that there is no logarithmic correction to the entanglement entropy, which agrees with previous results obtained via other methods. In addition, we show that the first-order corrections are proportional to the square root of the volume enclosed by the entangling surface. Finally, we calculate the second-order corrections and obtain an expression containing two terms. One of them has been previously found in Ref. [Phys. Rev.

This result shows that the gravitational Chern-Simons coupling constant plays a role similar to the Newton's constant in four dimensions."}
{"text":"The concept of long-range order is central to the understanding of many physical phenomena, including phase transitions and critical behavior in statistical mechanics.  In this article we present an analysis of the mathematical foundations for the study of such systems.   We begin by introducing the notion of a measure-preserving transformation on a probability space (X, \\Sigma, \\mu) as well as that of a measurable partition of X into subsets with equal probabilities.    Next, we define the entropy H(T) associated with T as the supremum over all possible values of the Shannon information content of any finite collection of sets belonging to some fixed partition P of X.   Finally, we introduce the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy hKS(T), which measures the rate at which information can be produced by observing the evolution of the system under consideration.   The main result presented here shows how these two quantities are related through the use of conditional entropies."}
{"text":"We study the effect of an external magnetic field on the modified Coulomb potential for two particles with opposite charges and masses, which are confined to move along one dimension. We show that this system can be mapped onto a spinless fermion model by using the Jordan-Wigner transformation. The ground state energy is calculated exactly within the framework of Bethe ansatz method. It turns out that there exists a critical value of the magnetic field strength beyond which the ground state becomes degenerate. This result agrees well with previous numerical calculations based on exact diagonalization technique. \n \n In addition we calculate the density-density correlation function as well as the momentum distribution function numerically. These results agree very well with those obtained analytically through the use of Bethe ansatz equations. Finally, we discuss how our results may be generalized to higher dimensions. Introduction:-In recent years considerable attention has been paid to the problem of strongly correlated electrons in low dimensional systems such as quantum wires or carbon nanotubes [1-3]. One of the most interesting phenomena observed experimentally in these systems is the fractional quantized Hall effect (FQHE) [4] . In particular it was shown that when the number of electrons N is odd ,the lowest Landau level(LLL) will contain only one electron per flux quanta [5] .The FQHEs have attracted much interest because they provide us with a unique opportunity to investigate many-body effects in condensed matter physics [6] .\nRecently, several authors [7-10] studied the properties of the modified coulomb interaction between two oppositely charged particles moving in a uniform magnetic field B perpendicularly to their plane of motion. They found that the ground-state energy depends crucially upon whether the total angular momentum J = L + S is zero or not where L is orbital angular momentum and S is spin angular momentum. For example if J=0 then the ground state energy is given by E0=\u2212e2\/lB+O(1\/N),where lB=eB\/mc is the magnetic length [11] .On the other hand if J=1\/2 then the ground state energy takes the form E0"}
{"text":"Epitaxial thin films of the multiferroic compound Bi2FeCrO 6 were grown on (001)-oriented SrTiO3 substrates by pulsed laser deposition at 750 \u00b0C in an oxygen partial pressure of 0.1 mbar and annealed for 30 min under vacuum conditions to induce ferroelectricity.  The structural properties of these epitaxial films are investigated using X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, scanning probe techniques as well as Raman spectroscopy. It is found that the films grow coherently strained along [001] direction with a tetragonal structure. A strong in-plane anisotropy between the out-of-plane lattice parameters c and a was observed which can be explained by different ionic radii of Fe 3+ , Cr 3+ and Ti 4+ . In addition, it could be shown that the films exhibit a rhombohedral-like distortion due to the presence of antiphase boundaries."}
{"text":"We present the results of our investigation on semiclassical scalar propagator in curved space-time, which is based on the WKB approximation to the wave function. We show that there are two different ways how one can define this quantity depending on whether or not one takes into account the back-reaction effects due to the quantum fluctuations of the gravitational field. The first approach leads to an expression for the semiclassical propagator which coincides with the Feynman propagator at large distances but differs significantly near the source point. In particular it does not satisfy the Hadamard condition required by general relativity. On the other hand, if we take into account the back reaction then the resulting expression satisfies all necessary conditions including the Hadamard condition. However, as was shown recently by Wald et al., such an expression cannot be obtained within the framework of standard QFT. This problem may have important consequences when considering the propagation of particles through black holes since the corresponding expressions differ substantially even outside the horizon."}

The Long Baseline Neutrinos Experiment (LBNE), currently under development by an international collaboration, plans to construct a new accelerator based neutrino beam facility in northern New Mexico. The facility would be located about 1000 km away from the FermiLab site in Chicago, IL where it could take advantage of the intense NuMI neutrino beam produced there. In addition to providing high intensity neutrino beams over a wide range of energies, the facility would include a large liquid argon time projection chamber detector capable of measuring both charged current interactions and neutral current elastic scattering events. The facility would provide unique opportunities to explore fundamental questions related to neutrino masses and mixings, CP violation, and other phenomena associated with neutrino oscillations."}
{"text":"We present the first measurement of the angular power spectrum of polarized dust emission at millimeter wavelengths, using data taken with the BICEP2 experiment in Antarctica during 2010 and 2011. We find that the polarization signal is consistent with predictions for thermal dust emission based on models constrained by Planck observations of temperature fluctuations. The amplitude of this signal is comparable to or larger than the expected gravitational lensing contribution over most multipole ranges probed here (l = 40-250). This result suggests that dust may be an important foreground contaminant for future CMB experiments targeting tensor modes. \n \n Keywords: Cosmic microwave background, Polarization, Dust emission, Gravitational waves, Inflationary cosmology \n \n Millimeter-wave polarimetry has been proposed as one method to detect primordial gravitational waves generated during inflation.

The IRAC observations cover about one third of the entire sky with |b| < 1 degree. We have identified more than 100 thousand candidate young stellar objects (YSOs), including both Class 0\/I YSOs and Classical T Tauri stars (CTTSs). About half of these are associated with previously known star-forming regions or open clusters. Most of them show extended emission around their central cores which is likely to be due to circumstellar disks and\/or envelopes. A large fraction of our sample shows bipolar morphology indicative of outflows driven by accretion onto the central star(s).\nThe spatial distribution of the newly discovered YSO candidates suggests that most of the recent massive star formation has occurred within the last few million years along the spiral arms of the Galaxy."}
{"text":"We study numerically and experimentally the dynamics of a liquid droplet bouncing on an inclined plane covered with superhydrophobic coating, which is known to be able to support stable levitation of drops in air.  We show that the lifetimes of such bouncing droplets are determined by their initial kinetic energy. The dependence of the lifetime on this energy can be fitted well using a power law t ~ E0\u2212\u03b1 where \u03b1 = 0.5 \u00b1 0.1 for both numerical simulations and experiments. This scaling behavior suggests that the lifetime of a bouncer depends only weakly on its initial velocity. In addition we find that the maximum height reached during each bounce decreases as the number of bounces increases. Finally, we demonstrate how these results can be used to estimate the surface tension of water based on experimental data. Bouncing droplets have been studied extensively over recent years due to their potential applications in microfluidics [1] . These systems typically consist of millimeter-sized droplets impacting onto hydrophobic surfaces [2] , but they also include smaller droplets bouncing off super-hydrophobic coatings [3] .\nIn many cases it has been observed that the droplets exhibit periodic motion [4] - [6] . However, there exist some examples of non-periodic bouncing [7, 8] or even chaotic trajectories [9] . It was shown recently [10] that the lifetimes (i.e., the times between successive impacts) of bouncing droplets depend strongly on their initial velocities. For example, if the initial speed is too high then the droplet will not bounce at all; instead it will slide down the surface until it reaches the bottom [11] . On the other hand, if the initial speed lies below a certain threshold value then the droplet will bounce indefinitely [12] ."}

We detect absorption features at 21 cm that are consistent with neutral hydrogen along our line-of-sight to this source. Using these data we derive an upper limit for its distance of <5 kpc. This is inconsistent with previous estimates based upon optical photometry or near-infrared spectroscopy. The discrepancy may be due to interstellar extinction effects and\/or variability between epochs of observation. If confirmed as a neutron star then it would have one of the lowest inferred surface magnetic fields known. It also has a spin period derivative that is among the highest observed for any pulsar.

{"text":"We present new calculations for massive star evolution, nucleosynthesis, and yields using updated nuclear reaction rates and solar abundances. We find that our results are sensitive to uncertainties in the helium burning rate at high temperatures (T > 2 x 10^9 K).

This result has important implications for studies of chemical enrichment by supernovae Ia progenitors. \n \n Keywords: Nuclear reactions; Supernovae; Stellar evolution; Yields \n \n 1 Introduction \n \n In this work we study how uncertainties in nuclear physics affect predictions about stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis. Our goal is to understand better what can be learned from observations of stars and their remnants. For example, it is well known that there exist large discrepancies between observed elemental abundance ratios in metal-poor halo stars and those predicted by standard models of galactic chemical evolution [1] . These differences may arise because some key nuclear processes have been poorly understood or not included in current evolutionary codes [2] , but they could also reflect systematic errors in observational data [3] .\n \nIn order to address these issues, we perform detailed numerical simulations of massive star evolution with different sets of input parameters. Specifically, we consider two cases where the initial mass fraction of helium XHe = 0.25 and 0.30 respectively [4] . We evolve each model until its core collapses into a neutron star. During the collapse phase, we follow the hydrodynamics of the explosion as described in [5] . Afterwards, we compute the composition of the ejecta using an improved version [6] of the one-dimensional post-processing code developed originally by [7] . \n \n 2 Input Physics and Numerical Methods"}

{"text":"We present the first direct determination of the stellar radius in an interacting binary system, using interferometric observations obtained with the VLTI and AMBER instrument. We resolve for the first time the components of the close binary system SS Leporis (separation ~0.3 arcsec), which consists of two main sequence stars that are both filling their respective Roche lobes. By fitting theoretical models to our data we find that one component is slightly larger than expected by theory while the other has a radius consistent with predictions based on evolutionary tracks. This result suggests that tidal interactions have modified the radii of these stars during their evolution towards contact. Our results also show that the orbital inclination angle i = 60 \u00b1 5 degrees, as determined previously through radial velocity measurements, agrees well with our new estimate derived directly from the observed separation between the two stars.

{"text":"The aim of this study was to evaluate whether virtual ultrasound (US) puncture tracts can improve percutaneous renal access in patients with complex anatomy and difficult-to-visualize calices on fluoroscopy.  In total, 50 consecutive patients underwent US-guided percutaneous nephrolithotomy using an in-room C-arm system for real-time image guidance. The procedure was performed under general anesthesia or conscious sedation. A pre-procedural CT scan was obtained without intravenous contrast medium injection. Using OsiriX MD software, two urologists delineated the kidney contour and identified all visible calices. Subsequently, they projected their findings onto the live fluoroscopic images during the procedure. They were asked to perform punctures into each calyx that could be visualized on fluoroscopy. After successful puncture, stone removal was attempted through the sheath inserted via the needle. Successful puncture was defined as reaching at least one calix. Overall success rate was 88%. No complications occurred related to the use of the US puncture tract projections. This technique may help urologists to achieve safe and efficient percutaneous renal access even if only few calices are clearly seen on fluoroscopy."}

{"text":"We report on observations made with Suzaku and Swift during the 2006 eruption of the recurrent nova RS Ophiucchi (RS Oph). The X-ray light curve shows that the source was brightest at around day 50 after the optical peak, when it reached an apparent luminosity of ~10^38 erg s-1. We find evidence for nonthermal emission up to 100 keV by fitting the observed spectrum with a power-law model modified by photoelectric absorption. This is consistent with previous results obtained using data taken with other satellites such as Chandra and XMM-Newton. In addition we found that the photon index changed significantly between days 40-50 and 60-70; this may be due to changes in the physical conditions near the central engine or in the geometry of the emitting region. \n \n We also detected significant hard X-ray emission above 10 keV which can not be explained solely by thermal bremsstrahlung radiation.

{"text":"In this talk, we will discuss the relationship between algebraic K-theory and partition functions in conformal field theory (CFT). We first recall some basic facts about CFTs and their partition functions. Then we introduce the notion of chiral algebras associated to CFTs which are certain infinite-dimensional Lie algebras acting on the Hilbert space of states of the CFT. The representation ring $R(A)$ of an algebra $A$ is defined as the Grothendieck group of finite dimensional representations of $A$. It turns out that for any chiral algebra $A_+$ there exists another chiral algebra $A_-$ such that $R(A_+ \\oplus A_-)=R(A_+) \\times R(A_-)$. This implies that the representation rings of chiral algebras can be computed by using only one copy of them at a time.  In particular, if $A_+$ is the Virasoro algebra then its representation ring is isomorphic to the Grothendieck ring $K_0(Coh(X))$ where $X$ is the Riemann surface corresponding to the CFT under consideration. On the other hand, it was shown by Witten that the generating function $Z(q)$ of the characters of all irreducible highest weight modules over the Virasoro algebra satisfies the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation. Using these results together with the fact that the character of a module is equal to the trace of the action of the generators of the chiral algebra on the module, we obtain a formula relating the generating function $Z(t)$ of the characters..."}
{"text":"We report the observation of magnetic fluctuations at low temperatures and high fields in single crystals of YBa2Cu3O6+x (YBCO) with x=0.4, 0.45, and 0.5 using muon spin relaxation measurements. The data show that these materials are characterized by an unusual temperature dependence of the fluctuation rate which is not consistent with predictions based on Fermi liquid theory or any other conventional model for fermionic quasiparticles. We argue that this behavior can be understood within a phenomenological description of the electronic excitations as bosonic collective modes. These results provide strong evidence against the existence of well-defined fermionic quasiparticles in the normal state of these compounds. They also suggest that the pseudogap phase may have some features in common with the superfluid state. \n \n High-temperature cuprate superconductors exhibit many remarkable properties including a rich variety of competing ground states. In particular, it has been suggested that they undergo a quantum phase transition into a novel ordered state known as the \"pseudogap\" phase [1] . This phase appears to exist between the underdoped regime where there is no static order but only short-range correlations [2] , and the overdoped regime where antiferromagnetism disappears [3] . It is believed that the pseudogap state plays an important role in understanding the mechanism responsible for high-Tc superconductivity [4] .\nIn recent years much attention has focused on the possibility that the pseudogap is associated with preformed pairs of charge carriers [5] . However, despite considerable experimental effort [6] , direct evidence for such pairing remains elusive [7, 8] . One possible explanation for this lack of success is that the pseudogap does not arise directly from pair formation [9] . Instead, it could result from the condensation of another type of collective mode [10] . For example, if the pseudogap were related to the onset of density wave ordering [11] then one would expect to see signatures of its presence in the form of low-energy magnetic fluctuations [12] . Indeed, several experiments have reported the detection of such fluctuations [13] - [16] ."}

The main difficulty lies in the fact that there are exponentially many possible alignments between any given set of input sequences. In this work we present an algorithm which solves exactly the same optimization problem as the popular progressive multiple sequence alignment (MSA) methods but has several advantages over them. First, our approach does not require the user to specify the number of clusters beforehand; instead it automatically determines how many clusters should be formed by analyzing the data at hand. Second, unlike MSA algorithms, ours can handle both gapless and gapped alignments simultaneously without requiring additional parameters. Finally, our algorithm runs faster than existing state-of-the-art approaches on all tested datasets while producing results of similar quality. \n \n We also show that our algorithm can be used to solve other related problems including clustering and classification of biological sequences based on their pairwise similarity scores."}

{"text":"We propose that relic gravitons are produced in the early universe and can be observed by future experiments such as CMBPol, LiteBIRD or PIXIE. We show how to calculate their number density using the effective field theory approach developed recently. The energy spectrum is calculated with the help of numerical simulations based on the loop quantum cosmological model. It turns out that there exists an optimal frequency range where the signal-to-noise ratio becomes maximal. This allows us to estimate the expected sensitivity reach of these experiments. Finally we discuss possible systematic effects which might affect our results. In this work we study the possibility of observing primordial gravitational waves predicted by loop quantum gravity (LQG) through its imprint on cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB). Gravitational waves are generated during inflationary epoch when quantum fluctuations of space-time geometry become classical stochastic fields. These fields evolve into tensor perturbations of metric which leave their signature in temperature anisotropies of CMB. However, it was shown that standard predictions of slow-roll inflation cannot explain current observations [1] . On the other hand, recent studies have demonstrated that LQC provides a consistent framework within which one can address some of the problems associated with standard inflationary scenario [2] .\nIn particular, it has been shown that LQC predicts significant suppression of power at large scales [3] , which could potentially resolve the problem of missing large-scale structure [4] .

{"text":"We study the Stokes vector evolution for an electromagnetic wave propagating through a weakly anisotropic and inhomogeneous medium, which is described by the permittivity tensor with off-diagonal elements that are small compared to its diagonal ones.  We derive analytical expressions for the components of the Stokes vector at any point along the ray trajectory using perturbation theory up to second order in the off-diagonal terms of the permittivity tensor. The results obtained show that the polarization state of light changes during propagation due to both birefringence effects caused by the anisotropy of the medium as well as dichroism effects induced by the presence of off-diagonal elements in the permittivity tensor. In particular, we find that the degree of circular polarization can change sign depending on the direction of the initial linear polarization. \nThe derived formulas allow us to analyze how different physical parameters affect the polarization properties of light rays passing through such media."}
{"text":"We study the efficiency of cosmic ray (CR) acceleration by relativistic shocks using Monte Carlo simulations and analytical calculations. We find that, for strong shocks with Mach number M = 10 - 100, only about 1% CRs can be accelerated to ultra-high energy (UHE). This is because most particles are scattered back upstream before they gain enough energy to cross the shock front again. The low efficiency of UHE particle production leads to an upper limit on the maximum proton energy as well as the total CR luminosity produced by such shocks. Our results suggest that the observed fluxes of UHE protons cannot be explained solely by diffusive shock acceleration mechanism operating at cosmological shocks. However, our findings do not rule out other mechanisms proposed recently to explain the origin of UHE cosmic rays. \n \n Keywords: Cosmic Ray Acceleration, Diffusive Shock Acceleration, Relativistic Shocks"}
{"text":"We study the magnetic field amplification in supernova remnants (SNRs) due to cosmic ray streaming instability, which is driven by anisotropic diffusion of energetic particles across the mean magnetic field lines. We show that this process can be responsible for the observed level of magnetic fields in young SNRs and may explain their origin. The growth rate of the instability depends on the ratio between the gyrofrequency of relativistic protons and the frequency of plasma waves excited by them. This ratio decreases with time as the number density of accelerated particles increases downstream of the shock front. As a result, the instability saturates at some distance behind the shock front where the magnetic energy density becomes comparable to the kinetic energy density of the flow. In order to estimate the saturation scale we use an analytical model developed recently by Bell et al. (2013) . It allows us to calculate the spectrum of amplified magnetic fluctuations produced by cosmic ray streaming instability."}
{"text":"We calculate the Coulomb integral in the SL(2, R) WZNW conformal field theory using the method developed by Kazakov and Migdal.  We show that this integral is related to the one-point function of the energy-momentum tensor on the sphere with two punctures. The latter can be calculated exactly as an expansion over the number of derivatives acting on the fields at the puncture points. This allows us to obtain exact results for the Coulomb integral up to any desired order in perturbation theory. In particular we find that the first non-trivial correction to the Coulomb integral comes only from the second derivative terms.

It has been shown [3] , that the correlators of the SL(2,  R) currents in this model have a direct interpretation in terms of correlation functions of operators in N = 4 super-Yang-Mills (SYM). These correlators play an important role in understanding the duality between type IIB superstrings on AdS 5 \u00d7 S 5 space-time background [4] and SYM [5] .\nIn [6] it was suggested how to use the SL(2,C)\/SU(2) coset construction [7] to compute these correlators. However, the explicit form of the corresponding three point functions were not known until recently [8] - [11] . One of the main difficulties in computing these correlators lies in calculating the so-called Coulomb integral [12] \nwhere J 1 \u2261 T ++ and J 2 \u2261 T \u2212\u2212 are the components of the stress-tensor current associated with the SL(2, Z) subgroup of the global symmetry group of the action functional.

{"text":"We present the discovery, photometric and spectroscopic observations of SN 2005hj (PTF10ygu), an apparently normal-bright Type Ia supernova discovered by PTF in late March 2005 at z = 0.084. The light curve shows two distinct peaks separated by about one month with no evidence for interaction between ejecta and circumstellar material. We find that this object is consistent with being a member of the class of \"normal-bright\" SNe Ia defined by Phillips et al. (1999) but has a higher peak luminosity than most members of this class. Using our own data as well as published results we estimate the distance to SN 2005hj using three different methods. All three give distances which are inconsistent with each other within their uncertainties. This may be due to systematic errors or it could indicate that there exists more than one subclass of \"normal-bright\" objects. If confirmed, these findings have important implications for cosmological studies based on SNe Ia. \n \n Keywords: Supernovae"}
{"text":"We have studied by means of molecular dynamics simulations how the dynamic behavior of silver atoms deposited on gold (100) is affected when the substrate temperature and the coverage are varied in such a way that the average number of nearest neighbors per atom changes between 1 to 4. We find that, for low coverages, the system behaves as if it were made up of isolated particles with no interaction among them. However, at higher coverages we observe collective effects which lead to the formation of ordered structures. The results obtained show that these structures can be classified into two different categories depending on whether they are formed by one or more layers of silver atoms. In particular, we found that the structure of the first layer depends strongly on the substrate temperature while the second layer shows only small variations. Finally, our calculations indicate that the third layer forms a disordered arrangement of silver atoms. This work was supported by DGESIC under project PB98-0443-C02-01"}
{"text":"We study damage propagation in an interface between two ordered phases of the confined Ising model (CIM) with random fields and quenched disorder, which is known to undergo a localization-delocalization transition as its temperature T crosses Tc = 1. We show that this transition can be observed by measuring the average size of avalanches triggered by local perturbations. The results are compared with those for the unperturbed CIM obtained using Monte Carlo simulations on large lattices. In particular we find that the distribution of avalanche sizes changes drastically across the transition point. This behavior is explained within the framework of the mean-field theory developed recently for the CIM. Finally, we discuss possible experimental realizations of our system. Introduction:-The phenomenon of phase coexistence has been studied extensively both theoretically [1] - [4] and experimentally [5] . It occurs when different thermodynamic states coexist in equilibrium [6] , or metastable states exist simultaneously [7] . A typical example is provided by water [8] where ice Ih and liquid water co-exist below 0 o C [9] .\nIn recent years there have been several studies [10] - [12] devoted to understanding how interfaces separating different phases evolve under external driving forces such as thermal fluctuations [13] , magnetic field [14] , mechanical stress [15] etc.. These investigations were motivated mainly by experiments performed on various materials [16] including ferroelectrics [17] , ferromagnets [18] , superconductors [19] , colloids [20] , granular media [21] , glasses [22] , foams [23] , and biological systems [24] . For instance, it was found [25] that the dynamics of domain walls in magnets [26] depends crucially on whether they are pinned [27] or not [28] . Similarly, the response of glassy [29] and jammed [30] systems to shear stresses [31] strongly depends on their preparation history [32] . On the other hand, the effect of quenched disorder [33] on the properties of interfaces [34] remains poorly understood [35] despite numerous theoretical [36] [38] and numerical [39] attempts made over the past few decades.\nRecently, the problem of interface evolution attracted renewed interest due to the discovery of new types of transitions occurring in spatially extended systems [40] [41]:"}
{"text":"We study dynamical heterogeneity (DH) in molecular dynamics simulations of supercooled water by analyzing the spatial distribution of relaxation times, as well as their dependence on temperature T and pressure P . We find that DH is present at all temperatures studied here, but becomes more pronounced with decreasing T , leading to an increase in the number of slow particles. The presence of DH leads to violations of both the Stokes-Einstein relation between diffusion constant D and viscosity \u03b7, and the Stokes-Einstein-Debeye relation between D and rotational relaxation time \u03c4R. These results are consistent with recent experiments probing the microscopic structure of glassy water. DOI: 10.1103\/PhysRevE.93.020101\nI. INTRODUCTORY REMARkS\nThe properties of liquids approaching the glass transition have been extensively investigated over many decades [1] . In particular, it has been shown that the structural relaxation time increases dramatically upon cooling [2] . This behavior can be understood within the framework of mode-coupling theory [3] which predicts that the liquid freezes into a solid-like state when the relaxation time exceeds the experimental observation window [4] .\nIn addition to this dramatic change in relaxation times, there also exists a growing body of evidence for the existence of \"dynamical heterogeneity\" (DH), i.e., spatially localized regions where particle motion slows down significantly compared to the average [5] . Such regions were first observed experimentally using neutron scattering [6] and later confirmed by computer simulation studies [7, 8] . It was found that these regions grow larger and become more numerous upon cooling [9] . Recent work suggests that DH may play an important role in determining the physical properties of glasses [10] . For example, it has been suggested that DH could explain why the shear modulus G decreases faster than predicted by the Debye-Stokes-Einstein equation [11] . Furthermore, it has recently been proposed that DH might provide insight into the origin of fragile-to-strong transitions [12] . However, despite its importance, little is known about how DH evolves during the process of vitrification or what determines its size and lifetime [13] .\nHere we investigate"}
{"text":"We propose an algorithm for network tomography that is able to reconstruct the internal structure of a network by using only one-dimensional (1-D) measurements, i.e., link counts between pairs of nodes in the network. The proposed method can be applied to any type of networks and does not require any prior knowledge about their topology or traffic patterns. We show how our approach can be used to estimate the number of active flows at each node as well as the amount of data transmitted over each flow. Our results are validated through extensive simulations performed with real Internet traces. Network tomography has been widely studied during recent years due to its potential applications in many areas such as computer security, quality-of-service provisioning, and traffic engineering [1] . In this context, it consists of estimating some properties of the network's internal state (such as the number of active flows per node or the amount of data transferred along each flow) by observing only external information (i.e., link-level statistics). This problem becomes particularly challenging when dealing with large-scale networks since the number of possible states grows exponentially with the size of the network [2] .\nIn order to overcome these limitations, several approaches have been recently proposed which exploit specific characteristics of the underlying network [3] , e.g., sparsity [4] - [6] , symmetry [7] , or regularity [8] . However, most existing methods assume either complete knowledge of the network topology [9]- [11] or accurate estimates of the traffic matrix [12] - [14] . Unfortunately, both assumptions may not hold in practice [15] , especially if we consider large and\/or dynamic networks [16] . For example, in IP-based networks, the exact location of routers cannot always be determined [17] while the traffic matrix is usually unknown [18] .

{"text":"The future evolution of the local large scale structure is investigated by using N-body simulations with different cosmological models, including dark energy (DE) and cold dark matter (CDM). The results show that in the \u039b-CDM model without DE, the growth rate of large-scale structures decreases rapidly at late times due to the effect of CDM. In contrast, for the same initial conditions but with DE included, the growth rates are almost constant over time. This indicates that the inclusion of DE can significantly affect the formation of large-scale structures on very large scales. We also find that the density profiles of clusters formed in these two cases have significant differences. These results suggest that it may be possible to distinguish between these two scenarios through observations of cluster properties such as their mass functions or X-ray luminosities.

{"text":"We present an overview on the nonequilibrium dynamics of open quantum systems, with emphasis in the role played by entropy and information-theoretic concepts such as mutual information or entanglement entropies. We discuss how these quantities can be used to characterize different phases of matter emerging out of non-equilibrium steady states (NESS). In particular we focus our attention on two paradigmatic examples of NESS: i) thermalization processes induced by coupling a system to its environment; ii) driven-dissipative many-body systems where dissipation is engineered through external driving fields. Finally, we briefly comment on some recent results concerning the characterization of out-of-equilibrium phase transitions using information-theoretical tools. Nonequilibrium phenomena are ubiquitous in nature and play a crucial role for understanding the physics behind several important problems ranging from energy conversion devices [1] , transport properties [2] , biological motors [3] , to quantum computing [4] . The study of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics has been pioneered by Onsager [5] who introduced the concept of linear response theory [6] which allows one to describe macroscopic fluctuations around equilibrium [7, 8] .\nIn this context it was shown that fluctuation relations [9] provide fundamental constraints on the statistics of work performed during a process [10] . These relations have been experimentally tested [11] and recently generalized beyond their original formulation [12] . Moreover, they were also extended to include higher-order cumulants [13] and time-reversal breaking [14] . Another key ingredient in the description of nonequilibrium phenomena is represented by the notion of entropy production [15] . This quantity measures the irreversibility associated with a given process [16] and plays a central role in the second law of thermodynamics [17] . It turns out that entropy production provides useful insights into the structure of nonequilibrium stationary states [18] . Indeed, it has been shown [19, 20] that if the entropy production vanishes then the state is necessarily described by Gibbs measure [21] . However, when the entropy production does not vanish there exist infinitely many possible nonequilibrium stationary states [22] ."}
{"text":"We present new results on temporal variability in the ultraviolet (UV) emission observed by Cassini's Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS). The data were obtained during orbits that crossed the equatorial plane at distances between 1,000 km and 5,500 km above Jupiter's surface. We find that the brightness distribution is highly variable both temporally and azimuthally with respect to Jupiter's magnetic field direction. This behavior can be explained if we assume that the plasma torus consists of multiple co-rotating structures which are not uniformly distributed around the planet but instead form an arc-like structure centered near the magnetic equator. These observations provide further evidence for the existence of such arcs as predicted by theoretical models. They also suggest that these arcs may have significant effects on the global magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling processes. \n \n Keywords: Jupiter, Saturn, Magnetospheres, Plasmas"}

{"text":"The present work is devoted to the study of the relationship between the orbital motion and the energy levels in atoms, ions or molecules. The main idea consists on establishing an analogy between the circular orbits of planets around their central star (Kepler's laws) and the electron shells in atoms (Pauli principle). In this way we can obtain new relationships among physical quantities such as the radius of the planet, its mass, the distance between two consecutive orbits, etc., which are useful when studying atomic systems. We also show that these results allow us to establish a connection between the Pauli principle and the concept of spin angular momentum.

{"text":"We present new results on the age, metallicity and alpha-element abundance for galactic globular clusters (GGCs) based on single stellar population models with different prescriptions for convection theory. We find that the ages derived by using the classical mixing-length theory are systematically younger than those obtained by assuming overshooting or semiconvection in the red giant branch phase. The difference between these two sets of ages is about 0.5 Gyr at most. For some metal-rich GGCs, we also found that their ages inferred from the classical mixing-length theory can be as young as 10 Gyr while they should have been older than 12 Gyr according to other methods. This discrepancy may result from the fact that the classical mixing-length theory cannot reproduce well the observed color-magnitude diagrams of such metal-rich GGCs. Our results show that there exists no significant correlation between the cluster's age and its metallicity.  These findings suggest that the formation history of GGCs might not be dominated by monolithic collapse but instead by hierarchical merging processes."}

{"text":"We study the correspondence principle between string theory on anti-de Sitter space-time (AdS(3)) and field theories at finite temperature, by using Hagedorn strings as probes. We show that the number density of Hagedorn strings is proportional to the free energy density of the thermal gas of massless particles in the dual field theory. This result implies that the entropy density of the thermal gas agrees with the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy density of black holes in AdS(3). In addition we find that the pressure of the thermal gas agrees exactly with the negative cosmological constant in AdS(3), which corresponds to the vacuum expectation value of the dilaton field in the dual conformal field theory. These results are consistent with the holographic principle proposed recently for strongly coupled gauge theories.

While each of these techniques performs reasonably well under certain conditions they all suffer from one common drawback; they require significant computational resources when searching for multiple transit candidates simultaneously. For example, the most widely used technique, Box Least Squares, requires O(N3) operations where N is the length of the time series being analyzed [6] .

In particular, it has been shown recently [4] that the relaxation behavior around the dynamic critical point (the so-called dynamical scaling region) provides useful information about the universality class of the system.

However, since the relaxation time diverges when approaching the critical point, it becomes difficult to obtain reliable data close enough to the critical point [7, 8] . Therefore, it would be very helpful if some characteristic points could be found where the relaxation time shows unusual behaviors [9] ."}

We compare our results against epidemiological models based on real-world census data and find good agreement when we scale down the size of the simulated population appropriately. This suggests that large-scale virtual worlds such as MMOGs can be used to study epidemics without requiring access to sensitive personal health records or detailed demographic data."}
{"text":"We present the results of our analysis of the radio emission and Faraday rotation measure (RM) for two giant spiral galaxies in the Virgo cluster, NGC 4254 and NGC 4501. The RM is measured using data at 1.4 GHz obtained with the VLA D-array configuration. We find that both galaxies have extended polarized structures which are aligned along their optical major axes. In addition to these large-scale features we detect several compact regions where the polarization vectors change direction abruptly by 90 degrees or more. These changes occur over angular scales as small as 0.1 arcsec corresponding to linear sizes of about 100 pc. We interpret this phenomenon as due to local reversals of the ordered magnetic field component perpendicular to the line-of-sight. This interpretation implies that the observed magnetic field structure has been produced by dynamo action within each galaxy. Our observations also show that there exists an additional regular magnetic field component parallel to the plane of the sky."}

We found that two of these systems are indeed double-mode Cepheids, while another one is probably a single-mode Cepheid. The remaining three systems show no significant periodicity at all. In addition to this we report on the discovery of a new multiperiodic Delta-Scuti variable which shows several frequencies between 0.5 and 1 d-1.

{"text":"We propose an algorithm for variable selection in high-dimensional regression problems by combining the lasso with prior information on the sparsity pattern of the solution. The proposed method is based on the idea that, if we know which variables are likely to be included or excluded from the model, then this knowledge can be used as additional constraints when solving the lasso problem. We show how these constraints can be incorporated using Lagrange multipliers and derive an efficient coordinate descent algorithm for computing the constrained lasso estimator. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that our approach leads to substantial improvements over existing methods both in terms of prediction accuracy and computational efficiency. In particular, it outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms such as SIS and ISIS even though they use more sophisticated techniques than ours. \n \n Keywords: Lasso, Variable selection, High dimensional data analysis, Coordinate descent algorithm, Constraints \n \n \n \n 1 Introduction \n \n In many applications involving high-dimensional data sets, there exists some prior information about the sparsity structure of the unknown parameter vector. For example, in gene expression studies one may expect only few genes to have non-zero effects while most other genes will not contribute at all (see e.g., Tibshirani et al. (2002) ). Similarly, in text mining tasks where documents are represented as vectors of word counts, it has been shown that only very small subsets of the available features are relevant for predicting certain target values (see e.g. Witten & Bell (1991) , Joachims (1998) ). \n \n This type of prior information can be exploited within the framework of penalized least squares estimators like the LASSO (Tibshirani 1996) . However, standard approaches do not take advantage of any specific structural properties of the underlying problem beyond the fact that the number of parameters p is large compared to the sample size n . As a consequence, these methods often suffer from poor performance due to their lack of adaptivity to the true sparsity pattern of \u03b2 . \n \n In this work, we consider the case where the set of active predictors A = { j :"}
{"text":"We propose that the two branches in the mass distribution of neutron stars are due to different mechanisms for their formation, with one branch being formed by accretion-induced collapse (AIC) of white dwarfs into neutron stars, while another is formed through core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe). We show how this scenario can explain both the existence of massive pulsars as well as the absence of such objects in the observed sample of CCSNe remnants. The proposed model also explains why there have been no successful attempts so far at detecting gravitational waves emitted during AIC events. In addition we argue that our model provides an explanation for the apparent discrepancy between the masses inferred from observations of binary systems containing black holes or neutron stars on one hand, and those inferred from measurements of the radii of isolated neutron stars on the other. Finally, we discuss possible observational tests which could be used to verify our hypothesis."}

We observed these candidates in the J=1-0 transition line of carbon monoxide (13CO), which is optically thin even towards dense cores. Our goal was to identify HMPSs by searching for compact molecular outflows traced by high-velocity wings in their 13CO spectra. In total we detected 16 HMPS candidates among our sample of 61 targets.

{"text":"We present an approach to temporal runtime verification based on monadic difference logic (MDL). MDL is a decidable fragment of first-order logic with the ability to express properties about sequences of states, such as those produced by model checkers or execution traces. We show how to translate formulas in this logic into automata and use these automata for monitoring executions against specifications expressed in MDL. Our translation preserves satisfiability and allows us to monitor infinite state systems. The resulting monitors are efficient enough that they can be used online during program execution. In addition we provide a method for reducing the size of the generated automata which makes them suitable for offline analysis. Finally, we demonstrate our technique on several examples including a Java implementation of the dining philosophers problem. This work was supported by NSF grant CCF-0430018.

{"text":"We study theoretically how the conformational properties of flexible and semiflexible chains are affected by electrostatic interactions with ions dissolved in solution, using Monte Carlo simulations for different values of ionic strength I. We find that the persistence length increases as a function of I due to screening effects between charged monomers along the chain backbone. The effect is more pronounced when increasing the charge density per unit length ql or decreasing the Bjerrum length lB = e2\/4\u03c0\u03b50kBT . In addition we show that the radius of gyration scales differently depending on whether the chain is flexible (Rg \u221d N1\/2) or semiflexible (Rg \u221d N1). Finally, we discuss our results within the context of recent experiments performed on DNA molecules immersed into an electrolyte solution. \n \n Introduction \n \n Polymeric systems play important roles in many biological processes such as protein folding [1] , gene regulation [2] , cell division [3] , etc., where they often interact strongly with other macromolecules and\/or solvents [4] . For example, it has been shown experimentally [5] that the structure of double stranded DNA can be significantly altered upon interaction with cations [6] . This behavior is also observed in synthetic biopolymers like polypeptides [7, 8] which have attracted considerable attention recently [9] .\n \nIn this work we focus on the role played by electrostatics on the conformation of polymer chains immersed in salt solutions.

The proposed system is based on a novel combination of two existing techniques: (1) automatic extraction of concept hierarchies using information-theoretic clustering algorithms; and (2) interactive relevance feedback with user defined similarities. We demonstrate our technique by applying it to the problem of searching through medical records stored in XML format. Our experiments show significant improvements over standard keyword-based approaches.

{"text":"We present an alternative method to the usual Feynman path integral description for calculating the probability amplitudes in quantum walk models, based on the concept of scattering states and their associated S-matrix elements. We show that this new formalism allows us to obtain exact results for several interesting cases where standard methods fail or are not applicable. In particular we consider two different types of boundary conditions at one end of the chain (the origin) which lead to completely different behaviour of the system as time evolves. The first type is known as Dirichlet boundary condition, corresponding to reflecting particles back into the origin after they have left it once; while the second case corresponds to absorbing particles when they reach the origin. For both these cases we calculate exactly the evolution operator over all times t > 0 using our new method. Finally, by applying the inverse Fourier transform to the evolution operator we can recover the full probability distribution function of finding the walker at any position x along the chain at time t."}
{"text":"We present new near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy obtained with the Subaru Telescope to study relationships among photospheric layers, molecular layers, dust shells, and SiO masers in the Mira star S Ori during four epochs spanning one year. The NIR spectra show that the CO fundamental band emission lines are blueshifted by ~10 km s-1 compared to those observed for other Miras. We also find that the H-band continuum flux is enhanced when the SiO maser intensity increases. These results suggest that the mass loss rate may be higher than previously thought. \n \n Key words: Mira variables, infrared, SiO masers, circumstellar envelopes, stellar winds, submm-wave observations \n \n 1. Introduction \n \n Mira stars have large amplitudes of light variation due to pulsation and their atmospheres undergo significant changes over time scales ranging from months to years. In particular, they exhibit strong mass-loss rates through outflows driven by radiation pressure on dust grains. As a result, these objects often possess extended circumstellar envelopes (CSEs). CSEs around Mira stars can be studied using various techniques such as optical\/UV spectrophotometry, radio\/submillimeter interferometry, and mid-infrared (MIR) imaging. However, it has been difficult to obtain spatially resolved information about the structure of CSEs because of their relatively low spatial resolution. On the other hand, high-resolution spectroscopic studies provide detailed information on physical conditions within CSEs but only along the line-of-sight toward the central star. Therefore, multi-epoch high-resolution spectroscopic observations are required to investigate temporal variations in CSE structures. \n \n 2. Observations and Data Reduction \n \n We performed multi-epoch high-resolution NIR spectroscopy of the Mira star S Ori (Mira = o Cet; spectral type M5IIIe-M6Iab) using the Cooled Mid-Infrared Spectrograph (COMICS), which was installed on the 8.2 m Subaru telescope in 2004.

{"text":"We show that, in addition to gravitational waves and neutrinos, there is an additional source of energy loss during the final stages of stellar evolution which has been largely ignored by previous authors. This arises because the universe becomes transparent to photons at redshifts z ~ 1100 (the time when matter-radiation equality occurs), allowing them to stream freely outwards into space. The resulting decrease in pressure causes the universe to expand faster than it would otherwise do, thereby accelerating its expansion rate. We estimate this effect for different types of stars and find that it can be significant - up to 10% of the total luminosity output of massive stars may be lost due to this process. In particular we predict that Type Ia supernovae should exhibit systematically lower peak luminosities compared with their observed values if they are not corrected for this effect. Finally, we discuss how our results could be tested observationally using current data on distant supernovae."}
{"text":"The ability to selectively kill cancer cells while sparing normal tissue is an important goal for many anti-cancer therapies, but it remains challenging because most current drugs are not specific enough and cause significant side effects on healthy tissues.  In this study we show that by using a combination of targeted drug delivery systems with computational models of cellular networks, one can achieve selective killing of tumor cells without damaging surrounding healthy tissue. \nWe developed a mathematical model of the apoptosis signaling network (ASN) which describes how different types of cancerous and non-cancerous cells respond to various stimuli such as chemotherapeutic agents or radiation therapy. We used our ASN model to predict optimal combinations of drugs targeting key nodes within the network that would lead to selective death of cancer cells. To test these predictions experimentally, we designed two novel drug delivery systems based on nanoparticles coated with ligands that bind specifically to receptors overexpressed only on certain types of cancer cells. Using these nanoparticle-based drug carriers, we were able to deliver multiple therapeutic compounds simultaneously into target cells and induce their selective death."}
{"text":"We study the relationship between cell-to-cell variation in gene expression, protein production rates, and phenotypic heterogeneity using mathematical models for bacterial chemotaxis. We show that this relationship is determined by how cells respond to external signals. In particular, we find that if all cells have identical responses then there can be no correlation between their behavior and their internal states; however, if some cells are more sensitive than others (i.e., they produce higher levels of proteins), then these cells will exhibit larger fluctuations in their behaviors. Finally, we demonstrate that our results hold true even when the number of signaling molecules produced by each cell varies randomly across time. Bacteria use chemical gradients as cues to navigate through their environments [1] . To sense such gradients bacteria employ a process known as chemotaxis [2] , which involves sensing changes in chemoattractant concentrations via receptors on the surface of the bacterium [3] .\nThe ability of individual bacteria to detect small differences in attractant concentration has been shown to depend strongly upon the stochastic nature of receptor-ligand binding [4] . This suggests that the observed cell-to-cell variations in gene expression may play an important role in determining the overall population-level sensitivity [5] . Indeed, recent experiments [6] suggest that the presence of noise in gene expression leads to increased sensitivity [7, 8] . However, it remains unclear whether or not this increase in sensitivity necessarily translates into greater cell-to-cell variation in behavior [9] ."}
{"text":"We present the results of our study on the evolution and nucleosynthesis in super-asymptotic giant branch (super-AGB) stars, which are evolved massive AGB stars with initial masses between 8 to 12 M\u2299. We have performed detailed stellar evolutionary calculations for these stars using the latest version of the FRANEC code. The calculated models show that super-AGB stars experience strong mass loss during their late stages of evolution due to pulsation driven winds. These stars lose about 0.5 M\u2299 before they enter into the white dwarf cooling phase. During this stage, we find that the surface abundances of CNO elements change significantly as compared to those at the end of the previous red giant phase. In particular, the surface abundance of nitrogen increases by more than one order of magnitude while carbon decreases by almost an order of magnitude. This is mainly because of the dredge-up episodes experienced by these stars when they cross the HR diagram towards higher luminosities."}
{"text":"The Fitzgerald-Lorentz contraction is usually presented as an effect that occurs in the rest frame of a moving object, and which causes it to appear shorter than its actual length when observed by someone who is at rest.  In this article we present a new interpretation of the phenomenon based on the idea that the apparent shortening of the object's length results not only from the fact that the observer sees less distance between two points along the object's trajectory but also because he or she sees more time elapse during the same interval of space-time. We show how this can be achieved using a simple model where the speed of light depends on the direction of propagation with respect to the velocity vector of the reference frame. The resulting picture is consistent with Einstein's special relativity theory while avoiding some of its most controversial aspects such as the existence of privileged frames of reference (the so-called \"ether\") and the concept of absolute simultaneity."}

The sample consists of all known OB stars within |b| < 1 degree and distances less than 5 kpc, which are associated with IRAS point sources that have been classified as having infrared excesses indicative of circumstellar disks or envelopes. We detect over 100 new compact HII regions at frequencies between 2.1 GHz and 6.0 GHz. These objects range in size from 0.01 pc to 0.5 pc and their luminosities vary by more than four orders of magnitude. Most of these newly detected compact HII regions appear to be excited by single O-type stars; however we also find several examples where two or three bright radio components are separated by only a few arcseconds. In addition, we identify a number of previously uncatalogued ultracompact HII regions whose sizes are smaller than 0.01 pc."}
{"text":"We revisit the constraints imposed by Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) and Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMBR) observations on the possible existence of massive, unstable neutrinos with lifetimes longer than 10^(10) s. We find that these limits are significantly weaker if one allows for non-standard interactions between neutrinos and photons in addition to standard weak interactions. In particular we show that BBN can be compatible with an unstable tau-neutrino mass as large as mtau = 1 TeV even when its decay rate is suppressed by a factor of 10^{10} compared to the Standard Model prediction. This result has important implications for models of leptogenesis which require heavy Majorana masses for right-handed neutrinos. The possibility of such light unstable particles also opens up new avenues for probing physics beyond the Standard Model at future colliders like LHC or ILC."}
{"text":"We study the quantum noise properties of gravitational wave detectors with signal recycling mirror (SRM). We show that, for an interferometer with SRM, there is no fundamental limit on its sensitivity at high frequencies due to vacuum fluctuations. The shot-noise limited sensitivity can be improved by increasing the circulating power inside the cavity formed between the two arms of the detector. This improvement comes at the expense of increased thermal noise associated with the mirrors forming this cavity. In addition we find that the effect of radiation pressure noise depends strongly on whether or not the input test mass is suspended. Finally, we discuss how these results may be used to improve existing designs of advanced LIGO-like detectors. PACS numbers: 04.80.Nn, 95.35.+d, 98.80.Cq Quantum noise limits the performance of current generation ground-based gravitationalwave detectors such as Advanced LIGO [1] . These detectors are based on Michelson-interferometric configurations which use Fabry-Perot cavities to enhance their sensitivity [2] . However, it has been shown recently [3] , using semi-classical analysis, that the shot-noise limited sensitivity of these detectors cannot be further improved beyond certain frequency range without introducing additional technical noise sources into the system. It was also suggested [4] that one way to overcome this problem could be to introduce another mirror called \"signal recycling\" mirror (SRM) into the optical path of the interferometer. Using this approach, it should be possible to increase the circulating power within the interferometer while keeping the same level of shot-noise limited sensitivity achieved before adding the SRM."}
{"text":"We report on the rapid diffusion of dipolar order in liquid crystals, which is responsible for an enhanced nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate and thus for a higher degree of dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP). The DNP effect was studied by means of electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy at X-band frequencies using a home-built high-field spectrometer equipped with a commercial microwave bridge operating at 2.5 GHz. We found that the enhancement factor increases strongly when approaching the nematic-isotropic phase transition temperature TNI = 35 \u00b0C. This finding can be explained by assuming that the molecular mobility decreases rapidly as TNI is approached. In addition to this observation we find that the maximum achievable enhancement factor depends critically on the sample geometry. For samples having a thickness d < 1 mm it reaches values up to 100 times larger than those observed for thicker samples. These results are important for future applications of DNP in NMR experiments performed under extreme conditions such as low temperatures or strong magnetic fields."}

In particular we find that: (i) The number of links per node scales linearly with system size. (ii) The clustering coefficient decreases logarithmically with system size. (iii) The average path length increases logarithmically with system size. These results agree well with those observed for both metabolic networks and social networks. Finally, by using our evolutionary approach, we predict new functional relationships among genes in the yeast cell cycle pathway. Complex networks have been found to play important roles in various fields ranging from physics [1] , biology [2] , sociology [3] , computer science [4] , etc..

{"text":"We present an analysis of the kinematics and dynamics of galaxies within galaxy clusters, using data obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST).

The results are compared against predictions made by cosmological N-body simulations that include both baryonic gas and collisionless dark matter particles. Our main conclusions are:  1) Galaxy clusters exhibit significant deviations from isotropic dynamical equilibrium; 2) These deviations can be explained if we assume that the dark matter component has a radially biased velocity dispersion tensor; 3) This result implies that the dark matter halos surrounding individual galaxies have similar shapes but different orientations relative to each other. In addition, our measurements provide new constraints on the mass-to-light ratio for galaxy clusters. Using HST observations of four nearby galaxy clusters, we find evidence that the dark matter component exhibits a strong radial bias in its velocity dispersion tensor."}
{"text":"The idea that the universe underwent an inflationary phase at very early times is now widely accepted by cosmologists as one possible explanation for many observed features of our present-day universe, such as its flatness and homogeneity.  In this talk I will discuss how string-theoretic ideas can be used to construct models of inflation which are consistent with current observations. The basic idea behind these constructions is that they involve branes moving through extra dimensions of space-time. These branes may either move towards each other or away from each other depending on their initial conditions. If two branes collide then it leads to a rapid expansion of spacetime known as \"inflation\". This process continues until the branes separate again and the universe reverts back to its original size. As well as discussing some recent results obtained using these techniques, I will also describe some open problems associated with them. Finally, I will briefly mention another approach to constructing realistic models of inflation based upon so-called \"brane-world scenarios\"."}

Therefore, the mechanical behavior of the skin tissue should be described by considering the interactions between different layers [7, 8] . Similarly, the mechanics of carbon nanotubes [9] and graphene sheets [10] also require the consideration of their unique structures [11] ."}
{"text":"We present infrared spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for a sample of 23 galaxies at redshifts 0.6 < z < 1.0, selected to have strong rest-frame ultraviolet emission lines and high star formation rates. The SEDs are derived using Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph observations in the 3.6 - 8 micron range combined with ground-based near-infrared spectroscopy covering the wavelength range between 0.9-2.5 microns. We use these data to derive stellar masses, ages, dust extinction values, and star-formation histories for each galaxy. Our results show that most of our objects are young systems with ages less than 100 Myr old; however we also find evidence for older populations in some cases. Most of the galaxies appear to be experiencing moderate levels of dust obscuration with A V ~ 1-3 mag., although there is significant scatter among individual objects."}
{"text":"We present an analysis of the kinematics and chemical composition of stars in the outer halo (R > 20 kpc) of our Galaxy, based on data obtained with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We find that these stars are consistent with being drawn from two populations: one is metal-poor and has a mean metallicity [Fe\/H] = -1.7 dex, while the other population is more metal-rich with a mean metallicity [ Fe \/ H ] = -0.8 dex . The former population shows a clear rotation signature around Galactic North Pole, which we interpret as evidence for its formation by tidal disruption of dwarf galaxies; this interpretation is supported by their high orbital eccentricities. On the other hand, the latter population does not show any significant rotation or orbital anisotropy, suggesting that it was formed through dissipative processes such as gas cooling and star formation."}
{"text":"We study the stability properties of circumnuclear disks (CNDs) embedded within elliptical galaxies, using N-body simulations with live dark matter halos and stellar components. We find that CNDs are generally stable against bar formation for most reasonable disk parameters. However, we also show that if the central black hole is massive enough to dominate the gravitational potential at small radii, then it can induce strong bars or even destroy the entire disk. This result suggests that the presence of a supermassive black hole may be responsible for some observed nuclear bars in nearby elliptical galaxies. \n \n Keywords: Gravitational instability; Black holes; Bars; Nuclear activity; Galaxy evolution; Disk galaxies; Dark matter halos; Stellar dynamics; Cosmology \n \n 1 Introduction \n \n The existence of nuclear bars has been inferred observationally by several authors based on photometric data (e.g., Laine et al. 2002; Erwin 2004) . In particular, Erwin & Sparke (2003) found that about half of their sample of early-type galaxies have nuclear bars. These results suggest that nuclear bars play an important role in galaxy evolution. For example, they could provide fuel for active galactic nuclei through gas inflow into the center of the host galaxy (Shlosman et al. 1990 ). On the other hand, there are only few observational studies which directly detect nuclear bars via high-resolution imaging techniques such as HST observations (Erwin 2004; Sheth et al. 2005) , mainly due to technical difficulties associated with resolving very compact structures near the centers of distant galaxies. Therefore, theoretical investigations of the dynamical behavior of nuclear bars will help us understand how these objects evolve over time. \n \n 2 Previous Work \n \n Several previous works studied the stability of nuclear bars in elliptical galaxies. Athanassoula et al. (2005a) performed numerical experiments where they added a rigidly rotating spherical component representing a bulge to a model consisting of a live halo and a rigidly rotating disk. They showed that this system becomes unstable when the mass ratio between the bulge and the disk exceeds a critical value"}
{"text":"We present the results of cosmological N-body simulations that follow the evolution of dark matter halos and their substructure over cosmic time, including all relevant physical processes (dark energy, gravity, hydrodynamics). We find that the phase-space density distribution function f($\\rho_{PSD}$) is well described by an exponential law with two free parameters $\\rho_0$ and $\\sigma_0$. The best-fit values for these parameters are found to be independent of halo mass or redshift within the range probed here. This result suggests that the phase space density distribution can be used as a statistical tool to study the properties of dark matter halos at different redshifts. In particular we show how this new statistic can be used to measure the amount of substructure inside dark matter halos. Finally, we discuss possible applications of our findings to future observations using gravitational lensing techniques. Subject headings: Cosmology -- Theory"}
{"text":"We present an analytical theory for describing capillary forces between two spherical particles in contact with each other and immersed into a liquid, which is valid even when the separation distance between them becomes comparable to their size. The theory takes into account both the effect of surface tension on the shape of menisci formed around the particles as well as the effect of gravity. We show that these effects lead to new types of attractive and repulsive capillary forces acting between the particles at small separations. In particular, we find that the gravitational force can induce a net attraction between the particles even if they are completely wetted by the liquid phase (i.e., have no dry patches). This prediction agrees very well with our numerical results obtained using Surface Evolver software package. Our theoretical predictions are also confirmed by experiments performed with polystyrene microspheres suspended in water. Capillary forces play important role in many physical phenomena such as adhesion [1] , sedimentation [2] , flotation [3] , etc.. However, despite numerous experimental studies [4] - [8] there still remains significant uncertainty about how exactly these forces depend on various parameters characterizing the system under consideration [9] . One of the main reasons behind this situation is that existing theories [10] - [12] developed within the framework of classical continuum mechanics cannot be applied directly to describe capillary interactions occurring at distances smaller than the characteristic length scale associated with the curvature of interfaces separating different phases [13] .\nIn order to overcome this difficulty one usually resorts to some approximate approaches based either on the concept of effective Hamaker constants [14] or on the so-called \"superposition approximation\" [15] . These methods allow one to obtain simple expressions for the total interaction energy but do not provide any information about its dependence on the detailed geometry of the problem [16] . Moreover, it has been shown recently [17] that the latter approach fails..."}
{"text":"We present an algorithm that computes the determinant of a square rational matrix with polynomial entries in time $O(n^{1.5})$, where $n$ is the size of the input matrix.

We also show how to compute the characteristic polynomial of such matrices using this approach. Our results improve upon previous work which used algorithms based on Gr\u00f6bner bases or continued fractions. They can be applied to solve problems arising in computational number theory (e.g., computing class groups), algebraic geometry (e.g., solving systems of multivariate polynomials over finite fields), computer algebra (e.g., factoring univariate polynomials over finite fields).

{"text":"We present an algorithm to compute the Jones polynomial using three quantum wires and one ancilla qubit, which is based on the idea that the Jones polynomial can be computed by evaluating the Tutte polynomial at 1. We show how this approach leads naturally to a circuit with O(n) gates in depth O(log n), where n denotes the number of crossings in the knot diagram. The main ingredient of our construction are two new families of unitary operators acting on tensor products of Hilbert spaces associated with graphs. These operators generalize the swap operator and have applications beyond computing the Jones polynomial. In particular we use them to construct efficient quantum circuits for other problems such as counting perfect matchings or finding maximum flows. \nIntroduction\n\nThe Jones polynomial J K (t) \u2208 Z[t \u00b11\/2 ] of a knot K is a Laurent polynomial invariant of knots and links defined by V. Jones [Jon87] . It has been shown that it distinguishes all prime knots up to 10 crossings [Kaw96] , but its complexity makes it hard to evaluate even for small values of t. For example, if K is the trefoil knot then J K (1) = \u22121\/4 while J K (\u22121\/2) = 1\/2. This raises the question whether there exists a quantum algorithm to efficiently calculate the Jones polynomial."}
{"text":"We study the dynamics on networks where nodes are connected by both short-range and long-range interactions, which can be either attractive or repulsive. We show that in this case there is no phase transition between ordered and disordered phases as it was observed for purely local interaction models. Instead we find an intermediate regime characterized by strong fluctuations of order parameters. The critical behavior at the boundary to the ordered state depends crucially on whether the long-range interactions are attractive or repulsive. In particular, if they are repulsive then the system exhibits mean-field-like criticality while for attractive long-range interactions one finds non-trivial exponents similar to those found previously for purely local systems. \nI. INTRODUCTIO N\nThe concept of self-organized criticality (SOC) has been introduced recently [1] . It describes a class of dynamical systems whose evolution leads them into states close to equilibrium without any fine tuning of control parameters [2] .\nIn SOC systems, the appearance of power-law distributions of avalanche sizes [3] , relaxation times [4] , etc., is explained by assuming that these systems evolve towards their critical point [5] . This idea has been applied successfully to many different physical phenomena [6] including earthquakes [7] , forest fires [8] , traffic jams [9] , sandpiles [10] , neural networks [11] , epidemics [12] , population dynamics [13] , etc..\nRecently, several authors have studied the effect of nonlocal interactions on the properties of SOC systems [14 -17] . They showed that nonlocal interactions lead to new interesting effects such as the absence of phase transitions [17] , the existence of multiple absorbing states [14] , and the possibility of having spatially localized solutions [15] . However, all previous studies were restricted to the case when only nearest-neighbor interactions exist. Here we consider more general cases when the network contains also long-range interactions."}

{"text":"We present an exact solution to the classical equations of motion in two dimensions, which is interpreted as describing a rotating black hole with angular momentum J = M . The metric has the form ds2 = \u2212dt2+(1+cosh2r)d\u03b82\u2212r2dr2,\nwhere r and \u03b8 are polar coordinates on the plane. This solution can be obtained by performing a duality transformation on the usual BTZ black hole (with no rotation). We show that this new solution satisfies all the required physical conditions at infinity. In particular we find that it describes a regular black hole horizon located atr+ = \u221a3M , where M is the mass parameter appearing in the original BTZ solution. Finally, we discuss some possible generalizations of our results. Introduction:-In recent years there have been many attempts to construct solutions to Einstein's field equations corresponding to rotating black holes [1] - [4] . One particularly interesting class of such solutions was found by Ba\u00f1ados, Teitelboim and Zanelli (BTZ), who showed how one could obtain a static black hole solution in three dimensional anti-de Sitter space-time [5] .\nThe most important feature of these solutions is their asymptotic behaviour; they describe black holes whose event horizons are completely determined by global quantities like total energy or charge [6] . However, despite being very useful tools for studying quantum gravity phenomena [7, 8] , these solutions do not provide any information about local properties of the spacetime near the horizon [9] . It would therefore seem desirable to try to extend them into more complicated geometries containing additional parameters characterizing the internal structure of the black hole [10] .\nOne way of doing so is to consider higher-dimensional extensions of the BTZ solution [11] . Another possibility is to perform a duality transformation on known solutions [12] . For example, if we start with the Schwarzschild solution written in terms of spherical coordinates, then after applying a suitable coordinate transformation we will get another solution expressed in terms of oblate spheroidal coordinates [13] ."}
{"text":"We study the effect of Rashba spin-orbit interaction on the spin Hall conductivity (SHC) for an interacting two-dimensional electron system with parabolic dispersion and Zeeman splitting in presence of a uniform external magnetic field applied normal to the plane of motion. We show that SHC is independent of temperature, chemical potential and strength of disorder provided the Fermi energy lies within the Zeeman gap. The results are obtained by using the Kubo formula combined with the self-consistent Born approximation. It has been shown recently that the spin current can be generated without any net charge flow when electrons move through a nonmagnetic material under the influence of spin-orbit coupling [1] . This phenomenon known as spin Hall effect was first predicted theoretically [2] , and later observed experimentally [3] .\nThe origin of this effect is due to the fact that the spin-orbit interaction causes a transverse force which deflects the trajectories of moving particles leading to a finite spin polarization at the edges [4] . In recent years there have been several theoretical studies devoted to understand various aspects of spin Hall effect [5] - [8] . However most of these works were done either in absence or weak magnetic fields where the Landau levels do not play significant role [9] . On the other hand it is well known that the Landau level quantization plays important role in determining many physical properties such as magnetoresistance [10] , optical absorption [11] etc., especially near the quantum limit [12] . Therefore it would be interesting to investigate how the Landau levels affect the spin Hall effect."}
{"text":"Strong gravitational lensing is an important tool for studying the mass distribution in galaxy clusters, but it requires accurate models and sophisticated techniques to extract useful information about cluster properties such as their masses or concentrations. In this work we present a new method that combines parametric and non-parametric approaches by using a flexible model based on Gaussian processes (GPs) with priors derived from numerical simulations. We apply our method to two simulated galaxy clusters and show how it can be used to recover the true underlying mass profiles accurately even when only noisy data are available. Finally, we demonstrate its performance on real observations taken with Hubble Space Telescope's Advanced Camera for Surveys. The results presented here will help us understand better the physical mechanisms driving the formation of massive structures at high redshifts. Strong gravitational lensing provides valuable insights into the structure of dark matter haloes around galaxies and galaxy clusters. However, extracting useful information from observed lensed images often requires detailed knowledge of the source population and complex modeling techniques. Here we introduce a novel method combining parametric and nonparametric approaches which uses a flexible model based on GPs with priors derived from cosmological N-body simulations. Our method allows one to reconstruct the three-dimensional density profile of galaxy clusters directly from observational data without any assumptions regarding the functional form of the profile itself. We test our technique on both simulated and real data sets obtained with HST\/ACS."}
{"text":"We study the seesaws with unbalanced masses for massive neutrinos in the framework of SU(2) L \u00d7 U(1) Y gauge theory, where one mass is much larger than another. We find that there are two different types of seesaws depending on whether or not the lightest neutral Higgs boson has non-vanishing vacuum expectation value (VEV). In case of no VEV, we show that the seesaw mechanism works well to explain smallness of active neutrino masses by introducing heavy right-handed Majorana neutrinos. On the other hand, if the lightest neutral Higgs field acquires non-zero VEV, then it gives rise to an additional contribution to the active neutrino masses which may be comparable to those generated through seesaws. This implies that the seesaw mechanism does not work so effectively as before. However, even in this case, we can still obtain tiny active neutrino masses by taking into account radiative corrections due to the presence of large extra dimensions."}
{"text":"In this article, we study cuspidal representations of general linear groups over discrete valuation rings. We prove that if the residue field is infinite and has characteristic zero then any irreducible representation which is unramified outside a finite set of primes is supercuspidal (Theorem 3).

As an application, we show how to construct new examples of supercuspidal representations by taking tensor products with characters of tori (Proposition 4).\nWe also give some results on the structure of the space of smooth functions on G(R) where G is a reductive group defined over Q p . In particular, we show that if G = GL n , SL n or Sp 2n then there exists a dense subspace of smooth functions invariant under right translation by elements in G(Q p ) (Corollary 5). Finally, we use these results to compute the dimension of certain spaces of automorphic forms attached to cuspidal representations of GL 2 (A) (Propositions 6 and 7)."}

The functional is obtained by minimizing the grand potential with respect to all possible orientations of the director field n(r). We show that this approach leads to results which are consistent with those obtained using Onsager's theory at high temperatures (T_T>T_N), but also provides new insight into the structure of the nematic phase near its critical point. In particular we find that the orientational order parameter S exhibits a non-monotonic behavior as a function of density, while the positional correlations remain short ranged throughout the entire range of densities studied here. Finally, our analysis shows that the nematic phase can be viewed as a superposition of two different liquid phases characterized by distinct values of the orientational order parameter.

We found that the PSFs were not always consistent between different bands even after the IFA had been completed. This inconsistency may be caused by some errors in the optical design or manufacturing process. In addition, we also found that there are still some problems remaining in the calibration accuracy of the detector pixel size.

{"text":"We present the results of cosmological simulations aimed at studying the formation and evolution of tidally stripped satellite galaxies in clusters, which we refer to as \"tidal dwarfs\" (TDs). We find that TDs are formed by the stripping of gas-rich satellites during their first pericentric passage through the cluster potential well. The resulting TDs have masses ranging between 10^8 M_sun and 10^10 M_sun, sizes smaller than 100 pc, and circular velocities larger than 50 km\/s. They evolve into more massive systems with higher surface brightnesses after several orbits within the host galaxy's virial radius. Our results suggest that TDs may be responsible for some fraction of the diffuse intracluster light observed around nearby rich clusters. Tidal dwarf galaxies (TDGs) are small star forming objects found near interacting or merging galaxies. Their origin is still debated but it has been suggested that they form when gas-rich satellites pass close enough to the center of the parent galaxy to become tidally disrupted. In this work we study the formation and evolution of TDGs using high resolution hydrodynamical cosmological zoom-in simulations performed with the code RAMSES-RT. We show that TDGs can be produced by the disruption of gas-rich satellites during the first pericenter passage inside the host galaxy halo. These TDGs typically have masses between 108M\u2299 and 1011M\u2299, sizes below 100pc, and circular velocities above 50km\/s. After several orbital periods these TDGs grow in mass and size becoming brighter and bluer.

We find no evidence for companions down to masses as small as 0.1 M Jup . In addition we present results from a targeted search for companions to three young stars in the Beta Pic Moving Group that are known to harbor debris disks. These targets have ages ranging from 12-30 Myr and were selected because they show signs of youthful activity such as accretion or outflows. No companions were detected within projected separations of 100 AU. Our non-detections suggest that either these systems do not form planetary mass objects beyond 50 AU over this age range, or that any companions formed closer-in but have since been ejected by dynamical interactions."}
{"text":"We present an analysis of the concept of algorithmically reducible problems in computational complexity theory, focusing on its role as a bridge between different areas within this field. We argue that there are at least two distinct ways to understand what it means for one problem to be reduced to another by an algorithm; these correspond roughly to the notions of polynomial-time reductions and Turing reductions respectively. The former is more commonly used than the latter, but we show how both can be understood in terms of each other using the notion of relativised polynomial time. In particular, we prove that every problem which is not NP-complete under Turing reductions must have some property which makes it easy to solve relative to any oracle set containing all NP sets. This result has implications for the relationship between P and NP, and also provides new insights into the structure of NP itself. Algorithmic reductions play a central role in computational complexity theory, providing a way of relating seemingly disparate classes of decision problems such as those belonging to the class NP (the non-deterministic polynomial time computable problems) with those belonging to the class co-NP (the complements of NP problems). However, despite their importance, relatively little attention has been paid to the precise meaning of the phrase \"algorithmically reduces to\"; indeed, even basic questions about the nature of this concept remain unanswered."}
{"text":"We study the transport properties in a one-dimensional (1D) spin-orbit coupled system, where the electron-electron interactions are treated within the Hartree-Fock approximation. We find that for strong enough spin-orbit coupling and repulsive interactions there is an insulating phase at half-filling which can be understood as a Mott insulator due to the formation of bound states between electrons on neighboring sites. The transition into this state occurs when the Fermi energy crosses the lowest bound state. In addition we show how the presence of disorder changes these results. Finally, we discuss possible experimental realizations of our model using semiconductor nanowires or carbon nanotubes. Introduction:-In recent years it has been realized that many interesting phenomena observed in condensed matter physics such as high-Tc superconductivity [1] , fractional quantum Hall effect [2] etc., have their origin in strongly correlated electronic systems. One of the simplest models describing interacting fermions is the Hubbard model [3] . However, even though much progress has been made over the past few decades [4] , exact solutions of the Hubbard model are still lacking [5] .\nRecently, several authors [6] - [8] studied the effects of spin-orbit coupling on the ground-state properties of 1D Hubbard chains by employing various numerical techniques like density matrix renormalization group [9] , exact diagonalization [10] , DMRG [11] , Bethe ansatz [12] , variational Monte Carlo [13] , Quantum Monte Carlo [14] etc.. It was found that depending upon the strength of spin-orbit coupling and the value of Coulomb repulsion U , different phases appear in the ground state.

{"text":"We study statistics of conductance oscillations in open quantum dots with electron-phonon interaction and dephasing time saturation at high temperatures. We show that this effect leads to appearance of new peaks in the distribution function of conductance fluctuations, which are absent for noninteracting electrons or when the dephasing time is not saturated. The positions of these peaks depend on temperature and dot size. This dependence can be used as an experimental tool for studying phonons in open quantum dots. \n \n Introduction \n \n In recent years there has been growing interest in transport through mesoscopic systems such as semiconductor nanowires [1] , carbon nanotubes [2] , graphene [3] .

It decreases rapidly with increasing T and decreasing L [10] . At low temperatures, the main contribution to conductance fluctuations comes from interference effects [11] .

We show that the magnifications of images produced by an equatorial circular source orbiting around a Kerr black hole can be expressed as functions of only two parameters, i.e., the angular momentum parameter $\\chi$ and the radius $R_s$ of the source circle. The results obtained here will provide us with new ways to probe the spacetime geometry near the event horizon of a Kerr black hole through observations of gravitationally lensed quasars or active galactic nuclei. In particular, we find that the maximum value of the total magnification factor is always less than $25$ when the source circle lies outside the photon ring but inside the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO), while it becomes greater than $25$ if the source circle falls into the ISCO region. This implies that the total magnification factor may exceed $25$ even though the source circle does not cross the event horizon."}
{"text":"We present an analysis of archival XMM-Newton data for the Seyfert 1 galaxy, Mkr841 (NGC 4151). We find that the soft excess emission is well described by a blackbody component with kT = 0.16 keV and luminosity LBB ~ 1043 erg s-1. The hard X-ray spectrum can be fitted either by a power law or Compton reflection model. In both cases we detect strong relativistic Fe K\u03b1 lines at 6.4-6.7 keV which are broadened to FWHM ~ 1000 km\/sec. These results suggest that there may exist two distinct regions where the accretion disk interacts with the central supermassive black hole. One region produces the soft excess via thermal reprocessing while another one gives rise to the hard X-ray emission through non-thermal processes such as inverse Compton scattering and\/or Compton reflection."}
{"text":"We study the spectrum statistics of random matrices with entries given by the sum over all paths in an infinite tree, which is obtained as a limit of finite rank deformations of large Wigner matrices. We show that for any fixed number of particles there exists a sequence of such deformations converging to the limiting matrix whose spectral properties are described by the Tracy-Widom distribution. In particular we prove universality of this distribution for the case when the number of particles tends to infinity. The results presented here generalize those known previously only for the Gaussian ensembles. This work was supported by Russian Science Foundation grant 14-50-00040. 1 Introduction.\nThe problem of statistical description of the energy levels of complex quantum systems has been studied extensively during last decades (see e.g., [1] ). It turns out that many important features of these spectra can be understood within Random Matrix Theory (RMT) [2] . RMT deals with the statistical analysis of the eigenvalue distributions of various families of random matrices. One of the most popular models considered in RMT is the so-called Wigner ensemble [3] , where one considers N \u00d7N Hermitian matrices H = H \u2020 with independent identically distributed elements h ij having mean zero and variance 1\/N . For example, if the probability density function p(h) of each element h ij decays fast enough at |h| \u2192 \u221e then it follows from the standard arguments [4] that the empirical measure \u00b5 N of the normalized eigenvectors of H converges weakly almost surely to some deterministic probability measure \u00b5 on the unit circle T = {z \u2208 C : |z| = 1} called circular law. Moreover, under additional assumptions about the decay rate of p(h), the Stieltjes transform m N (z) := E TrH \u2212 z \u22121 of \u00b5 N converges pointwise almost surely to the Stieltjes transform M (z) of \u00b5 [5] .\nIn recent years much attention has been paid to the investigation of the local behavior of the spectrum near its edge [6] - [8] . In particular, it turned out [9] that the fluctuation statistics of the largest eigenvalues \u03bb max i"}
{"text":"The present work is concerned with the study of the propagation and interaction of two colliding plane shocks in air at high Mach number, M = 5. The governing equations are those for compressible flow given by the Navier-Stokes equations including terms representing thermal conduction and viscosity as well as molecular diffusion effects due to heat transfer between different species. These equations have been solved numerically on an axisymmetric grid system using a finite difference method based upon the MacCormack scheme. In order to obtain solutions which represent physically realistic flows it was necessary to use artificially generated boundary conditions along all boundaries except that separating the computational domain into regions I and II where the initial conditions were specified. It has been found that the inclusion of mass diffusion leads to significant changes in the nature of the solution obtained when compared with results previously published without this effect included. For example, the maximum density behind each shock wave decreases significantly while the pressure increases slightly."}
{"text":"We study nonequilibrium spin dependent transport properties of normal-metal-superconductor (NS) and ferromagnet-superconductor (FS) hybrid systems by using the quasiclassical theory for diffusive conductors with spin-orbit scattering. We show that, due to the proximity effect induced pair correlations between electrons on opposite sides of NS interface, there is an additional contribution to the current density which depends on the relative orientation of magnetizations in F and S layers. This results in appearance of the anomalous Josephson-like current-phase relation in FS junctions. In addition we find that the Andreev reflection at NS interfaces can be strongly suppressed if the angle between magnetization directions in N and S regions becomes sufficiently large. The suppression of Andreev reflection leads to the reduction of conductance through NS junction as compared to its value in equilibrium state. \n \n Finally, we discuss possible experimental realizations of our predictions."}
{"text":"We study the effect of decoherence on quantum simulations of strongly correlated systems in one dimension, focusing on the case where the number of particles is large and the Hilbert space grows exponentially with this number. We show that for certain classes of Hamiltonians it is possible to perform efficient numerical calculations using tensor network methods even when the effects of decoherence are taken into account. In particular we consider two different types of errors which can be simulated by adding extra terms to the Hamiltonian describing the evolution of the system. The first type of error corresponds to local fluctuations in the energy levels of individual sites while the second type describes global fluctuations affecting all sites equally. For both cases we find that the resulting effective dynamics can still be efficiently described within the same class of tensor networks as before. This allows us to calculate the time dependence of observables such as correlation functions or entanglement entropy accurately despite the presence of noise."}

We argue that CMChange occurs when individuals engage with their contexts by interpreting them differently than they were previously interpreted. As such, CMChange involves both contextualization and recontextualizatton. Contextualization refers to the process whereby individuals make sense of their contexts based on their own experiences and perspectives. Recontextualization refers to the act of reinterpreting one's interpretation of his\/her context(s), thereby changing its meaning and\/or significance.

The proposed method is illustrated on simulated examples and real-world data. In particular, it is applied to analyze gene expression profiles obtained by microarray experiments. Our results suggest that the proposed approach may provide useful insights into the analysis of high-dimensional biological data. Keywords: Information theory; Gene expression data; Filtering; Multivariate data analysis. Probability density functionals are widely used in statistics and machine learning [1] . They have been successfully employed in various applications such as classification [2] , clustering [3] , regression [4] or feature selection [5] .\nIn this work, we focus on one specific functional -the Kullback-Leibner (KL) divergence [6] which measures the difference between two probability distributions. It has found numerous applications ranging from image processing [7] to bioinformatics [8] . For example, it was recently shown [9] that the KL-divergence can be effectively used to assess the quality of clusterings produced by partitional algorithms [10] . Another application of the KL-divergence is its use as an objective function in supervised dimensionality reduction [11] where it serves as a criterion for selecting features relevant for predicting target values [12] .

{"text":"We show that entropy production in quantum field theory is related to the vacuum energy density and its time evolution, which can be used as an indicator for the presence of dark energy. We consider two different models with varying degrees of complexity: (i) a scalar field model where we calculate the entropy production using the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism; (ii) a more realistic model based on QED including fermions and photons. In both cases we find that the entropy production increases monotonically when the vacuum energy decreases over time. This behavior is consistent with our expectation that the universe becomes less ordered if it expands faster than usual due to the presence of dark energy. \n \n Introduction \n \n The accelerated expansion of the universe has been confirmed by many observations [1] . It is generally believed that this acceleration is driven by some form of \"dark energy\" [2] , whose nature remains unknown. One possible explanation for such a phenomenon could be provided by the so-called \"quintessence\" fields [3] - [4] . These are hypothetical scalar fields with negative pressure, which evolve slowly down their potential wells leading to a decrease in the vacuum energy density over time. Another possibility would be that the observed acceleration results from modifications of gravity at large distances [5] - [6] . However, there exist other explanations [7] - [8] . \n \n In order to distinguish between these possibilities one needs to develop new methods allowing us to probe the properties of dark energy directly [9] . Here we propose a novel approach based on the concept of entropy production [10] - [11] . Entropy measures how much disorder or randomness exists in a system [12] . If the universe accelerates because of dark energy then the rate of entropy production should increase accordingly. On the contrary, if the universe decelerates then the entropy production will slow down. Therefore, measuring the amount of entropy produced during the cosmic evolution may provide important information about the underlying physics responsible for the current state of the universe. \n \n In what follows we demonstrate that entropy production in quantum electrodynamics (QED), i.e., the interaction of electrons, positrons and photons, depends crucially on the value"}
{"text":"In this work, we study spin effect on resonant tunneling characteristics in double-barrier heterostructure under longitudinal stresses by using transfer matrix method and density functional theory (DFT). We find that the energy gap decreases with increasing stress for both majority-spin electrons and minority-spin holes. The decrease is more significant for minority-spin holes than for majority-spin electrons. In addition, the transmission coefficient increases with increasing stress at low bias voltage but decreases at high bias voltage. This behavior can be explained as follows. At low bias voltage, the increase of transmission coefficient results mainly from the reduction of barrier height due to compressive stress. However, at high bias voltage, the decrease of transmission coefficient comes from two factors: one is the increase of effective mass induced by tensile stress; another is the enhancement of electron-phonon interaction caused by tensile stress. Finally, it should be noted that our calculation shows that the spin-orbit coupling has little influence on the transport properties of the system considered here."}

It provides valuable information about the structure of nucleon resonances as well as their interactions with other particles. Charged pion photoproduction off protons has been studied extensively over many years both experimentally [1]-[6] and theoretically [7][8][9][10] . This process plays an essential role in understanding the dynamics of strong interaction between quarks inside the proton [11] .\nIn this work we use the Regge formalism [12] - [14] , where the scattering amplitude is expressed through the contributions of different reggeized exchanges. These exchanges correspond to various types of hadrons exchanged in t-channel. For example, the contribution of the $J\/\\psi$-exchange corresponds to the exchange of vector meson $\\bar{\\pi}^*$ while the contribution of the $f_0$ or $f_1$ meson corresponds to the exchange of axial-vector mesons. The amplitudes corresponding to these exchanges have specific analytic properties such as discontinuities across certain lines in complex angular momentum plane known as regge cuts [15] . The discontinuity along each cut determines the residue function associated with the corresponding regge pole [16] . The residues contain information about the coupling constants and masses of the exchanged hadrons [17] ."}
{"text":"The pressure-induced insulator-metal (IMT) phase transition is studied by means of the first-principles calculations based on density functional theory within local spin-density approximation and generalized gradient approximations. The calculated results show that the IMT occurs at about 20 GPa for both LSDA and PBE functionals, which are consistent with previous theoretical studies. However, it should be noted that there exists an obvious difference between these two methods when calculating the electronic structure near Fermi level. In addition to this, we also find that the band gap decreases rapidly as increasing pressure up to 30 GPa but then becomes almost constant above 40 GPa. Finally, our calculation shows that the volume collapse takes place around 50 GPa. \n \n Keywords: Pressure-induced insulator-metal transition; First-principles calculations; Local spin-density approximation; Generalized gradient approximations; Electronic structure; Band gap"}
{"text":"We present an analysis of the relationship between excluded volume and cooperative effects in proteins with respect to their folding rates. We show that these two factors are not independent but rather have opposite relationships with rate constants for different classes of proteins. The results suggest that both excluded volume and cooperativity play important roles in determining the folding rates of globular proteins. In particular, we find that the effect of excluded volume on folding rates is strongly dependent upon the degree of cooperativity exhibited by each protein class. This dependence arises because the presence of large amounts of nonlocal structure can compensate for the loss of local interactions due to excluded volume. Our results also indicate that there may be a fundamental difference between how fast-folding and slow-folding proteins fold. Finally, our findings provide insight into why some proteins fold faster than others despite having similar structures. Proteins fold through a series of conformational changes driven by thermal fluctuations or other external forces such as ligand binding. These processes occur over time scales ranging from microseconds to seconds depending on the size and complexity of the folded state1 . Despite this wide range of timescales, all known proteins share common features including compact tertiary folds2 , hydrophobic cores3 , and secondary structure elements4 .\nTheoretical studies5-7 have shown that the free energy landscape governing protein folding contains many metastable states separated by barriers whose heights depend on the strength of native contacts8-10 . Because the height of these barriers determines the overall folding rate11-13 , it has been suggested14-16 that the folding process occurs via a rugged funnel-like free energy surface17-20 . However, recent experiments21-24 have challenged this viewpoint25-27 by showing that the folding mechanism of several small single-domain proteins does not involve significant kinetic intermediates28-30 . Instead, these proteins appear to fold directly from unfolded states to folded ones without passing through any partially folded states31-33 ."}

{"text":"The structure and dynamics of lipid membranes are important for many biological processes, such as cell division or protein transport across the membrane. In this work we use atomic force microscopy to investigate the structural properties of stacked layers of phospholipids in water. We find that these structures form spontaneously on mica surfaces at room temperature within minutes after adding the lipids into solution. The height profiles show that the thicknesses of the individual layers vary between 1 nm and 2 nm depending on their composition. By analyzing the lateral diffusion coefficients of single molecules with respect to time, we can determine whether they are mobile or immobile. Our results indicate that the mobility is strongly dependent on the number of layers present in each stack. For example, while most of the molecules in one layer diffuse freely over large distances, those in two layers exhibit only small displacements perpendicular to the surface. This behavior suggests that the mobility decreases significantly when more than one layer forms."}

Using these galaxy samples we measure the abundance evolution of massive halos as well as their clustering properties over this range. The results are compared against predictions made by semi-analytic models that include prescriptions for black hole growth and AGN feedback. Our main conclusions are: 1) At all redshifts probed here, there is an excess number density of massive halos relative to model predictions. 2) This discrepancy increases towards higher redshifts. 3) There is also evidence for a lack of massive halos at low redshifts when comparing our measurements to those predicted by current models. 4) These findings suggest that either the efficiency or duty cycle of AGN feedback must be increased significantly beyond what has been assumed previously."}

{"text":"We present an algorithm for finding galaxy clusters using only photometric redshifts and no spectroscopic information, based on identifying overdensities of galaxies with similar colours. We apply this method to the Millennium simulation (Springel et al., 2005) and compare our results against those obtained by applying the same technique to mock catalogues constructed from semi-analytic models of galaxy formation within dark matter haloes. The comparison shows that we are able to recover most of the true cluster population at z < 1.5, but find significant contamination due to projection effects beyond this redshift. This is mainly caused by the fact that the colour-magnitude relation becomes less tight as one moves towards higher redshifts. Our analysis also reveals that there exists a large number of spurious detections which can be removed by imposing additional constraints such as requiring all candidate members to have magnitudes brighter than some threshold value or by restricting ourselves to systems whose total luminosity exceeds a certain limit."}
{"text":"The authors have used scanning tunneling microscopy to study the surface structure and electronic properties of single crystals of the high-temperature cuprate superconductor Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+d (Bi-2212).

The binding energy is found to be about 0.5 eV per hole pair. This value agrees well with theoretical predictions for the strength of the pairing force between holes in these materials. \n \n In addition, they observe that the density of states near the Fermi level shows a strong dependence on the direction along which the crystal is cut.

However, if the cleavage plane is perpendicular to the Cu-O planes, no such peak appears."}

{"text":"In this work, we study end-to-end distortion in a buffered transmission system with fading channel and power control. We consider two different scenarios depending on whether or not there is feedback information available at transmitter side. In both cases, we derive closed-form expressions for average end-to-end distortion as well as its upper bound under Rayleigh flat-fading channels. The results show that when there exists no feedback link between source node and destination node, the optimal power allocation strategy depends only on the instantaneous channel gain. However, if there are some feedback links to provide the knowledge about the current channel state, then it can be shown that the optimal power allocation strategy also depends on the past channel states. Finally, numerical examples are provided to illustrate our theoretical analysis.

However, one major problem associated with these systems is the limited bandwidth which leads to high bit error rate [2] .\nTo overcome this problem, various techniques including forward error correction coding [3] , diversity combining [4] , adaptive modulation [5] , power control [6] , unequal error protection [7] , joint source-channel coding [8] , etc., have been proposed by researchers. Among them, power control has attracted much attention because it allows us to adjust transmit power according to varying channel conditions so as to maximize the data rates while maintaining acceptable quality-of-service [9] . For example, in [10] - [12] , authors studied the effect of power control on outage probability and ergodic capacity respectively. On the other hand, in [13] - [15] , authors investigated the performance of power controlled communication systems using Shannon's mutual information criterion."}

The energy distribution function shows a power law behavior at low energies indicating the presence of many metastable states. In addition we also observe a peak near E=0 which corresponds to the ground state configurations. Finally, we show that the average overlap between successive generations decreases exponentially as one goes away from the ground state configuration. This indicates that there are no other low-energy states apart from the ground state. \n \n 1 Introduction \n \n Spin glasses have been studied extensively over last few decades both theoretically [1]-[3] and experimentally [4] .

{"text":"The conformational space available to the side chains in proteins can be explored using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, but this approach requires extensive computational resources for large systems. We have developed an alternative method that uses normal mode analysis (NMA), which has been shown previously to provide accurate predictions of protein motions at low computational cost.  In our new method we use NMA to calculate the free energy landscape associated with each side chain rotation angle. The resulting landscapes are then used as input into a statistical mechanical model that predicts the equilibrium distribution of rotamers observed experimentally. This method was tested on two small proteins containing multiple proline residues, where it correctly predicted the relative population of different rotameric states. It also accurately reproduced experimental results obtained by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). Finally, we applied this method to study the effect of mutations on the rotamer distributions of several amino acids. Our results show how changes in the local environment affect the rotamer preferences of these residues."}

The main idea behind our approach consists in reducing the problem to that of finding the number of solutions of certain systems of linear equations modulo primes of small norm. This allows us to obtain a very fast running time by using standard techniques such as modular reduction or lattice basis reduction algorithms. In particular we show how this method can be used to compute efficiently the number of rational points on hyperelliptic curves defined over prime fields.

In addition, we find new phases with charge-density wave order or coexisting antiferromagnetism and d-wave superconductivity away from halffilling. The latter are found to be stable over large regions of parameter space and can thus provide a possible explanation for recent experimental observations in high-temperature cuprate superconductors. \n \n Introduction \n \n One of the most important open questions in condensed matter physics concerns the nature of electronic states near the Fermi level in strongly correlated materials such as high-Tc cuprates [1\u20133] . While these systems have been studied extensively both experimentally and theoretically during the past decades [4\u20136] , it remains unclear how their unusual properties emerge from microscopic models [7\u20139] . A promising route towards answering this question involves studying simplified lattice Hamiltonians which capture some essential features of real materials [10\u201312] .

The evolution of the coronal magnetic field is studied using potential-field source-surface (PFSS) model. In addition we perform NLFFF extrapolations with different codes for comparison purposes. Our results show that both PFSS and NLFFF models are able to reproduce the large-scale structure of the corona but differ significantly at small scales. This discrepancy can be explained by considering the effect of plasma flows along open field lines. Finally, we study the relationship between the observed photospheric motions and the changes in the coronal magnetic field. Active Region NOAA 11158 was one of the most energetic regions ever recorded. It produced several X-class flares including an X2.2 event on February 16, 2011 , when it crossed the central meridian.

One important problem in these areas is to verify whether certain properties hold over all possible behaviors of the system. This task requires solving infinite state reachability problems, which are known to be undecidable even for very simple classes of systems [24] . Therefore, one usually resorts to approximating the set of states reachable within some time horizon T > 0 (called the reach set) by means of simpler mathematical objects called symbolic models [25] .\nSymbolic models have been successfully employed in various contexts such as verification [26] , controller synthesis [27] , fault diagnosis [28] , and optimal control [29] among others [30] . However, most existing approaches focus only on linear dynamics [31] while ignoring the rich class of nonlinear systems [32] .

In addition, it has been shown that the total energy density is positive definite everywhere inside the star. Finally, we show that our results agree well with those obtained by GR.

{"text":"We study the spatial and kinematic alignment between central and satellite halos in cosmological N-body simulations, focusing on their dependence on halo mass ratio (q = Msat\/Mcen) and redshift z. We find that satellites are preferentially located along filaments connecting to their host galaxy at all redshifts studied here (0 < z < 3). The degree of this alignment increases with decreasing q for fixed z, but decreases with increasing z for fixed q. This trend is consistent with theoretical predictions based on tidal torque theory. In addition, we show that the velocity difference between central and satellite galaxies depends strongly on both q and z. For example, when q > 0.1, the mean radial velocity difference |vr| decreases rapidly as z increases; however, |vr| remains nearly constant over cosmic time if q < 0.01. These results suggest that the observed evolution of the luminosity function may be affected by the dynamical friction acting on satellite galaxies."}

Furthermore, it was suggested [6] that unparticles might play a role in explaining some puzzling features observed recently in cosmic ray data [7, 8] . \n \n Another interesting possibility is that unparticles couple directly to SM fermions [9] . If this were true then one would expect to see effects similar to those predicted in Ref. [10] for Kaluza-Klein gravitons coupled to leptons.

This model provides a natural explanation for the observed correlation between the duration of the gravitational waves signal and its frequency content. In addition we find that the energy emitted in gravitational waves scales linearly with the mass of the system while it scales quadratically with the total spin angular momentum of the system. Finally our results are consistent with observations made by Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope which found no evidence for gamma ray emission prior to merger time.

For example, they found that unparticles could contribute significantly to some processes involving missing transverse momentum [9] or lepton flavor violating decays [10] . Moreover, the production rate of unparticles at hadron colliders [11] and their signatures [12] were also discussed recently. \nThe purpose of our work here is to investigate whether unparticles can affect low-energy parity-violating experiments. Since these experiments involve only weak interactions between quarks and leptons, they provide us good opportunities to search for new physics beyond SM [13] . As far as we know, the most stringent constraints come from the measurement of neutron electric dipole moment [14] .

The numerical solution is obtained by solving simultaneously two coupled partial differential equations that describe the evolution of the ionization fraction and temperature fields inside each cell of a grid covering the computational domain. We show how this method can be used to study the reionization process driven by UV photons emitted by galaxies. In particular we compare our results with those obtained using the Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics technique.

{"text":"We have studied the evolution of magnetic fields on Ap-type stars using data obtained with the ESPaDOnS spectropolarimeter at CFHT, Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT).

{"text":"We present results on the production and evolution of Langmuir waves (LWs) excited by an intense laser pulse interacting with a supersonic plasma flow, which is generated by a pulsed gas jet. The LWs are detected using Thomson scattering at different angles to the direction of propagation of the laser beam. We show that the LW spectrum has two distinct components: one component corresponds to the excitation of LWs by the ponderomotive force of the laser field; another component arises due to nonlinear wave-wave interactions between counter-propagating LWs. In addition, we find that the LWs can be efficiently converted into electromagnetic waves via Landau damping. Finally, we demonstrate that the LWs decay into ion acoustic waves through modulational instability. These findings provide new insights into the physics of diffusive radiation in plasmas driven by strong shocks. \n \n Introduction \n \n Diffuse radiative emission plays an important role in many astrophysical phenomena such as solar flares [1] , supernovae [2] , gamma-ray bursts [3] . It also occurs in laboratory experiments [4] where it may limit the efficiency of inertial confinement fusion schemes [5] . However, despite its importance there remain significant uncertainties about how diffuse radiation is generated [6] .\n \nIn this Letter, we report experimental measurements of the generation and evolution of Langmuintype waves (LWs), which play a key role in the process of diffusive radiation [7\u20139] .

{"text":"The phonon spectrum is calculated for the anisotropic triangular lattice with nearest-neighbor hopping and next-nearest neighbor repulsion using exact diagonalization method. The results are compared to those obtained by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which show that DFT underestimates the energy gap between acoustic and optical branches as well as overestimating the bandwidths. We find that the lowest-lying branch has an almost linear dispersion relation at small wave vectors, while higher branches have quadratic dispersions. In addition we observe flat bands near the Fermi level arising due to strong electron-phonon coupling. These features can be observed experimentally through angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements. \n \n Introduction: \n \n One of the most important properties of high-temperature superconducting materials is their ability to carry current without resistance below certain critical temperature T_c. This phenomenon arises because these materials undergoes a phase transition into a state where electrons pair up to form bosonic quasiparticles known as Cooper pairs. However, it was not until recently when the microscopic origin of this pairing mechanism became clear after the discovery of unconventional d-wave symmetry of the order parameter [1] . It turns out that the key ingredient responsible for such behavior is the presence of strongly correlated electronic states on the Fermi surface [2] , which leads to the formation of collective excitations called phonons [3] . Therefore, understanding how phonons behave in different types of lattices may provide valuable information about the nature of the underlying interactions among charge carriers [4] .\n \nIn recent years there has been growing interest in studying the effects of phonons on the physical properties of various classes of compounds [5] - [8] . For example, one of the simplest models used to describe the physics of cuprates is based on the two-dimensional square lattice [9] - [11] . On the other hand, another class of compounds known as iron-based pnictides [12] - [14] also exhibits similar characteristics but they are described by more complicated three-dimensional structures [15] - [17] . Moreover, some theoretical studies suggest that the role played by phonons in determining the ground-state properties of these systems cannot be ignored [18] -"}

The mean [Fe\/H] values we derive range between -2.3 dex and -1.9 dex depending upon which cluster is considered.  These results confirm previous suggestions that there may be no significant differences between the properties of the stellar populations found within individual open or globular star clusters versus those found in the general Galactic halo population.

{"text":"We propose to use the open string field theory (OSFT) as a model for inflation in type IIB superstring theory, which is based on the tachyon condensation and its decay into closed strings. We show that this OSFT can be described by a noncommutative geometry with a fuzzy sphere background. The resulting effective action contains higher derivative terms such as R4 term, but it does not contain any ghosts or tachyons. This suggests that our proposal may provide a consistent description of inflationary universe within the framework of string theory. In addition we find that there are two possible ways to realize inflation depending on whether the inflaton is identified with the radius of the fuzzy sphere or the radial component of the gauge fields living on the branes. Finally we discuss some phenomenological consequences of these models. Introduction:-In recent years many attempts have been made towards understanding cosmology using string\/M-theory [1] . One of the most interesting proposals has been the idea of D-brane inflation [2] , where one considers a stack of N coincident D3-branes moving slowly through the extra dimensions. It was shown that if the distance between the branes becomes small enough then they start to interact strongly via exchange of massless closed string modes [3] . As a result the potential energy density stored in the form of open strings stretched between them starts to decrease rapidly leading to spontaneous symmetry breaking [4] .\nThe main problem associated with this scenario is how to stabilize the size of the extra dimensions so that the system remains at the minimum of the potential during inflation [5] ? A simple way out would be to consider compactification of the extra dimensions [6] . However, this leads to problems like moduli stabilization [7, 8] and also introduces unwanted degrees of freedom [9] . Another possibility is to introduce anti-D3-branes [10] which lead to additional contributions to the scalar potential [11] . But again this requires fine tuning [12] . Recently Sen [13] proposed another mechanism called \"tachyon condensation\" [14] , where he showed that the unstable vacuum state corresponding to the maximum of the potential decays into stable states corresponding to minima"}

{"text":"We present results on dust formation in primordial supernova remnants (SNRs) using three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations with detailed chemical networks for gas-phase species, grains, and molecules. We find that dust can form efficiently in SNR ejecta at high temperatures (T > 1000 K), but it is destroyed by sputtering due to collisions between ions and electrons when the temperature drops below T = 100 K. The surviving dust grains are injected into the interstellar medium (ISM). Our calculations show that the total mass of dust formed in primordial SNRs may reach up to 10^-4 Msun if we assume an initial metallicity Z = 0.1Zsun. This value agrees well with observations of nearby young SNRs. However, our model predicts too much carbonaceous dust compared to silicates observed in these objects. If this discrepancy persists after further improvements of the models, then some other mechanism should be responsible for producing silicates in SNRs. \n \n Keywords: dust, supernova remnant"}

In particular, the decays of charmonium states such as $J\/\\psi$ and $\\psi^{\\prime}$ into an omega and pion provide important information on the structure of these particles [2] , while their branching fractions can also serve as input parameters for phenomenological models [3] .\n \nIn this work we consider the following processes:\n \n \n \n $$\\tag{I}\\phi\\rightarrow\\omega\\pi^{0}$$\n $$\\tag{II}J\/\\psi\\rightarrow\\omega\\pi^{0},$$\n $$\\tagIII\\psi^{\\prime}\\rightarrow \\omega\\pi^{0}.$$\n These processes proceed through one-loop Feynman diagrams involving virtual vector mesons ($\\phi$) and nucleon resonances ($N$). As shown in Figs. 1(a), 2(a) and 3(a), there exist two types of contributions to each amplitude: one where the initial state has spin 0 and another where it has spin 1.

{"text":"We present new results on the long-term evolution of solar magnetic fields, obtained by applying an advanced data analysis technique to observations made with the Wilcox Solar Observatory (WSO) magnetograph between 1976 and 2009. The method is based on wavelet transforms in combination with principal component analysis (PCA). It allows us to separate different types of variability into their individual components at each point in time. We find that there are two distinct modes of solar magnetic field evolution over this period. One mode shows strong fluctuations around a mean value which varies slowly but significantly during the cycle 23\/24 minimum. This behaviour can be explained as being due to the presence of large-scale dynamo waves driven by differential rotation. In addition we identify another type of variation which appears to have no preferred frequency or spatial scale. These variations show significant correlations with sunspot number and other proxies for solar activity. They may therefore represent some form of global response of the Sun's magnetic field to changes in its internal dynamics."}
{"text":"We present the results of our analysis of the radio emission from supernova remnant (SNR) 1987A, which is dominated by two bright sources located at opposite sides of the shell.

The second source was discovered recently as an extended feature that appears to be associated with the reverse shock front produced during the explosion.  Its spectrum peaks between 5 and 8 GHz and it shows no evidence for spectral turnover up to 20 GHz. We interpret this source as synchrotron radiation emitted by relativistic electrons accelerated behind the forward shock wave driven into the circumstellar medium by the expanding blast wave generated by the supernova explosion. In addition we find evidence for another component of emission peaking near 3 GHz whose origin remains unclear.

{"text":"We have studied the rheology of isotropic networks formed by crosslinking actin filaments with two different concentrations of biotin-avidin linkers, using microrheology experiments on single filament dynamics in combination with macrorheology measurements performed at low frequencies (0.01-10 Hz).

The results show that increasing the concentration of avidin leads to denser networks with stiffer links. This effect is more pronounced when the initial concentration of actin filaments is higher. Our findings suggest that the mechanical properties of actomyosin gels may be tunable through changes in the amount and\/or type of crosslinks present within these systems. In living cells, cytoskeletal structures such as stress fibers or focal adhesions provide physical connections between cell components and play important roles in determining cellular mechanics [1] .

These structures support Bloch waves whose wave vectors lie within the first Brillouin zone [9] . When the frequency falls inside the photonic band gap (PBG), no propagating modes exist; thus, all incident radiation will be reflected back [10] .

{"text":"The lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) is an alternative approach for solving the Navier-Stokes equations in fluid dynamics, which has been widely used due to its advantages over traditional numerical methods such as finite difference and finite element approaches.

The MRT-LBM solves the discrete velocity model (DVM), where each distribution function represents one component of the macroscopic variables at different velocities on a regular grid. We use the D2Q9 DVM to solve the two-dimensional incompressible flow problems. To validate our proposed algorithm, several benchmark tests are performed including lid-driven cavity flow, Couette flow, Poiseuille flow, Taylor-Green vortex flow, and shock wave propagation through a channel.

{"text":"We study evolutionary dynamics in an ensemble of genotypes, each with its own fitness value and connected to other genotypes by mutations. We show that for large ensembles there is always one genotype which has more connections than any other genotype. This genotype dominates all others at equilibrium. The dominance of this genotype depends only on the distribution of mutational distances between pairs of genotypes. For example, if we consider two different distributions of mutational distances (the exponential and power law), then the same genotype will dominate both cases. However, the time it takes to reach equilibrium can be very different depending on how many paths lead away from the dominant genotype. In particular, when the number of paths leading away from the dominant genotype increases exponentially as a function of distance, the system reaches equilibrium much faster compared to the case where the number of paths grows slower or even remains constant. \n \n We also find that the average population size of the dominant genotype decreases slowly over time until reaching equilibrium."}

A possible explanation for these phenomena could lie within the framework of modified theories of gravity [5] .\nIn order to explain the observed acceleration of the universe it seems necessary to introduce some form of \"dark energy\" [6] into Einstein's field equations [7, 8] . However, there appears to be little agreement amongst theorists about what exactly constitutes dark energy [9] or whether it should even exist [10] . Furthermore, if one assumes that dark energy exists then it must be extremely finely tuned [11] so that it behaves like a cosmological constant [12] over many orders of magnitude [13] . It also remains unclear why such a small value of vacuum energy density would arise naturally [14] .\nAnother possibility is that the apparent accelerating behaviour of the universe arises due to quantum effects [15] . For example, loop quantum gravity [16] predicts that space-time becomes discrete [17] leading to corrections to the Friedmann equation [18] . These corrections become significant when the scale factor reaches values close to the Planck length [19] . Other approaches include string theory [20] where the extra dimensions of spacetime [21] provide another source of potential modifications [22] ."}

The best-fit values for the linear bias parameter are b1 = 1.7 +\/- 0.2 for the scale-independent case and b2 = 2.3 +\/- 0.4 for the scale-dependent case. These results suggest that galaxies may be biased tracers of dark matter fluctuations with different bias parameters depending upon their mass or luminosity. This is consistent with previous studies which have found evidence for scale dependence in the galaxy-matter cross-correlation function. However, we note that our conclusions depend strongly on the assumed functional form for the scale dependent bias factor."}
{"text":"We study the critical behaviour of irreversible reaction systems with mass-action kinetics in one dimension, using Monte Carlo simulations and mean-field theory. We find that for large system sizes there is no phase transition at all; instead we observe an abrupt change between two different dynamical regimes as a function of temperature T . For low temperatures (T < Tc) the dynamics are dominated by fluctuations which lead to slow relaxation times towards equilibrium. In contrast, for high temperatures (T > Tc), the dynamics become much faster since the system relaxes quickly into metastable states. The crossover temperature Tc depends on the number N of particles present in the system and increases logarithmically with N .\nThe results presented here can be understood within the framework of the recently developed concept of \"active matter\". Active matter consists of self-propelled units such as living cells or artificial microswimmers. It has been shown that active matter exhibits similar properties as conventional condensed matter close to its critical point."}
{"text":"In this work, we propose an efficient watermarking scheme for digital images based on the discrete wavelet transform (DWT). The proposed method embeds the watermark into the high-frequency sub-bands by modifying their coefficients using a quantization index modulation technique. In order to detect the embedded watermark in the attacked image, we use a correlation detector with a threshold value that is determined adaptively according to the local statistics of each block. Experimental results show that our algorithm has good performance against various attacks such as JPEG compression, salt & pepper noise addition, Gaussian filtering, cropping, rotation, scaling, blurring, sharpening, histogram equalization, gamma correction, median filter, and mean filter. Keywords: Watermarking; Discrete Wavelet Transform; Quantization Index Modulation; Adaptive Threshold Value. Digital watermarking technology can be used to protect copyrights or prevent illegal distribution of digital content. However, it may also cause some problems if the watermarks are not detected correctly due to intentional or unintentional attacks. Therefore, robustness should always be considered when designing any watermarking system."}
{"text":"We study anonymity systems that operate over unstructured networks, such as Tor and Mixminion. We show how to construct mixes with provable guarantees against traffic analysis attacks by using only local information about the topology of the underlying network. Our construction is based on mixing small groups of users together at each node along their paths through the system. This approach allows us to achieve high levels of anonymity while maintaining low latency for most messages. In addition, we present several extensions to our basic scheme which allow it to be deployed more easily in practice. Finally, we evaluate our system both analytically and experimentally, showing that it achieves good performance under realistic conditions. Anonymity systems are used to protect user privacy when sending or receiving data over public communication channels. These systems typically consist of a set of nodes (called mixes) connected via some anonymous communication channel. Each message entering the system is encrypted multiple times before being sent out again; this process is called \"mixing\". The goal of these systems is to prevent attackers from linking senders and receivers of messages within the system. However, if all messages go through exactly the same sequence of mixes then they can still be linked using statistical techniques known as \"traffic analysis\". Traffic analysis has been shown to compromise the security of many existing anonymity systems including Tor [1] , Crowds [2] , Onion Routing [3] , Freenet [4] , and Mixminion [5] . To overcome this problem, researchers have proposed various approaches [6] - [8] .\nIn this work, we focus on anonymity systems operating over unstructured networks [9]- [11] . Unstructured networks differ from traditional peer-to-peer networks [12] because there is no global knowledge available regarding the structure of the network. Instead, each node maintains only partial information about its immediate neighbors. For example, in the case of Tor [13] , each node knows only the identity of its direct neighbors but not those of other nodes further away. As another example, in Mixminion [14] , each node knows only whether two given nodes are directly connected or not"}
{"text":"We present the results of three-dimensional MHD simulations that show how magnetic fields can be amplified by shocks in molecular clouds, and lead to the formation of dense filaments with high mass-to-flux ratios. The initial conditions are based on observations of nearby star-forming regions. We find that shock compression leads to an increase in density and temperature at the post-shock region. This causes the gas pressure gradient across the shock front to decrease rapidly as time progresses. As a result, the field lines become more tangled due to turbulent motions induced by the shock wave. In addition, we observe that the magnetic energy is transferred into kinetic energy through Alfv\u00e9n waves generated behind the shock fronts. Finally, we demonstrate that these processes cause the magnetic flux-to-mass ratio to increase significantly within the shocked region. \n \n Keywords: Magnetic fields, Shocks, Star formation, Turbulence \n \n 1. Introduction \n \n Molecular clouds play important roles in star formation (SF) because they provide the material for stars to form out of. However, it remains unclear what physical mechanisms drive SF inside molecular clouds. One possible mechanism involves supersonic turbulence driven by supernovae explosions or stellar winds (Mac Low & Klessen 2004). Another possibility is that large-scale gravitational collapse may trigger localised fragmentation leading to the formation of dense cores which then evolve into protostars (Larson 1978; Bonnell et al. 1997) . It has been suggested that both scenarios could operate simultaneously during different stages of evolution of molecular clouds (Krumholz 2014). \n \n Recent observational studies have shown that many young massive stars are associated with filamentary structures observed in infrared dust emission maps (Andr\u00e9 et al. 2010; Peretto et al. 2013 ). These filaments often appear to be aligned along magnetic field directions inferred from polarisation measurements (Chapman et al. 2011) , suggesting that magnetic fields might play an important role in regulating the dynamics of such systems. Indeed, theoretical models suggest that magnetic fields can affect the stability properties of self-gravitating clouds against global collapse (Mouschovias 1976; Tomis"}

INTRODUCTIO N\nThe discovery of neutrinos has opened up an exciting possibility of probing beyond Standard Model (SM), especially its Majorana nature [1] , through their lepton number violating interactions [2] . One interesting scenario is the seesaw mechanism [3] where SM singlet right-handed neutrinos acquire large Majorana masses after electroweak symmetry breaking [4] .\nIn order to test whether the observed light neutrinos are indeed Majorana particles, one needs to look for lepton-number-violating processes mediated by virtual heavy neutrinos [5] . These include neutrinoless double beta decay [6] , tritium beta decay [7] , and charged-current quasielastic scattering [8] . However, it turns out that all these processes suffer from severe astrophysical and\/or nuclear matrix element uncertainties [9] . On the other hand, colliders provide clean environments to probe lepton number violation directly [10] . For example, searches for same-sign dileptons [11] and trileptons [12] at hadronic colliders could lead to important information about Majorana neutrinos [13] . Another promising channel is the production of doubly-charge scalar particles [14] , which can occur either through s-channel exchange of neutral gauge bosons [15] or t-channel exchange of heavy ferm"}
{"text":"We study the conservation laws for linear parabolic equations with constant coefficients in one space dimension, which are given by Noether's theorem as integrals over time of certain densities that depend on solutions to the equation. We show how these densities can be computed using an algorithm based on symbolic integration techniques.

Keywords: Conservation law, symmetry group, potential symmetry, Noether's theorem, linear partial differential equations, Maple. 1 Introduction In this article we present some results concerning conservation laws and potential symmetries of linear parabolic equations. These results were obtained during my PhD thesis [1] , where I developed algorithms for computing conserved quantities associated with such equations. Here we give a brief overview of our main results. \nThe concept of conservation law plays an important role in physics since it allows us to describe physical phenomena in terms of energy or entropy balance. For example, if u(x, t) denotes the temperature distribution inside a rod at position x \u2208 [0, 1] and time t \u2265 0 then the total amount of heat contained within the rod satisfies the following equation: \nwhere c > 0 is a positive constant describing the thermal conductivity of the material. If we assume that there exists no source term f = 0, i.e., all the heat entering the system leaves again after some time interval, then integrating Eq. (1) \nover the spatial domain yields the first integral of motion Q(t), also known as the energy density,\nwhich describes the total amount of heat stored up in the rod at any point in time. Note that the second equality follows directly from Green's formula applied to the left-hand side of Eq. (2)."}

We discuss how this issue is related to other problems such as black hole entropy, time travel paradoxes, and information loss. Finally we review some recent developments on these topics. The nature of generic cosmological singularities has been one of the most important open questions in theoretical physics for many years. In particular it is not known whether or not there are any physical processes that can take place at all times near the big bang (or equivalently near the big crunch). This question is intimately connected with several other fundamental issues including black hole entropy, time machine paradoxes, and information loss\/reduction. It also plays a crucial role in understanding the very early universe. Recently significant progress has been made towards answering this question using techniques developed within the context of string theory. Here I will give a brief summary of what is currently understood about this topic."}
{"text":"In this work, we propose an online fault detection method for plasma etching reactors based on virtual sensors (VSs). The proposed VSs are constructed by using the principal component analysis (PCA) technique to extract features from process data collected in real time. Then, these extracted features are used as inputs into two different classifiers, namely support vector machine (SVM), and extreme learning machine (ELM). Finally, the outputs of both SVM and ELM are combined with majority voting rule to make final decisions about faults occurring in the reactor system. In order to evaluate the performance of our approach, experiments have been conducted on a simulated model of a commercial inductively coupled plasma (ICP) etcher. Experimental results show that the proposed method can detect various types of faults effectively while maintaining low false alarm rates. Moreover, it is also shown that the proposed method outperforms existing methods such as PCA-SVM and PCA-ELM."}
{"text":"We present results on the volume operator in loop quantum gravity (LQG). The volume operator is an important ingredient for many physical applications, such as black hole entropy and cosmological perturbations. We show that it can be written as a sum over spin network states with coefficients which are determined by the geometry of the underlying graph. In particular we find that the spectrum of this operator agrees exactly with the one obtained using group field theory methods. This provides further evidence for the equivalence between LQG and group field theory at the level of operators. Finally, we discuss how to use these results to compute expectation values of the volume operator in semiclassical states. These results will appear elsewhere.

{"text":"We study the simple shear flow for two different types of inelastic Maxwell models, one with constant restitution coefficient and another with velocity dependent restitution coefficient. We find that there is no steady state solution when the system has only elastic collisions but it exists if we include some dissipative effects. The steady state solutions are found to be independent of initial conditions as well as the type of dissipation included. In addition, we also show that these steady states are linearly stable under small perturbations. Finally, we present results on the relaxation time scales associated with this problem which can be used to estimate the rate at which the system approaches its steady state. \n \n Introduction:- \n \n Simple shear flows have been studied extensively both theoretically [1]-[3] and experimentally [4]-[6] . These studies were motivated by the fact that such flows occur naturally in many physical systems like granular materials [7] , colloidal suspensions [8] etc.. It was shown recently [9] - [11] that even though the microscopic dynamics may be very complicated (like in case of granular particles), the macroscopic behaviour of the system could still be described using relatively simpler kinetic equations like Boltzmann equation or Enskog equation [12] . However, most of these works deal with elastic interactions between the particles while the effect of dissipation is usually ignored. This assumption is not always valid especially in cases where the particles interact via soft potentials [13] .\n \nIn recent years, several authors [14] - [16] have considered the effect of dissipation on various properties of dilute gases. For example, in Ref. [17] , the author considers an inelastic gas consisting of identical hard spheres interacting through a repulsive potential and shows how the presence of dissipation affects the transport coefficients of the system. On the other hand, in Refs. [18] - [20] , the authors consider a model consisting of point particles interacting via a pairwise additive potential and derive expressions for the transport coefficients of the corresponding fluid. They then use these expressions to calculate the viscosity and thermal conductivity of the system."}

We show that under DARA preferences, the value function for this problem can be characterized as the unique solution to a nonlinear partial differential equation (PDE) which we call the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman-Isaacs PDE. This characterization allows us to use standard numerical methods such as finite difference or Monte Carlo simulation to compute the value function numerically. In addition, it also enables us to study how the optimal strategy depends on various parameters including the initial endowment, the interest rate, and the volatility of the stock price process.

However, most existing approaches are not suitable for evaluating large CNFs with millions or even billions of clauses due to their high computational complexity. In this work we present two novel techniques that significantly improve the efficiency of CNF formula evaluators: one based on parallelization using GPUs and another based on data compression by representing each clause as a bit vector instead of a set of literals. We implemented these techniques into our new software package called CLEVER-CNF, which outperforms state-of-the-art solvers such as SATzilla and Lingeling when evaluated against several benchmark sets including those used in recent SAT competitions."}

We find that these objects are consistent with being gravitationally bound open clusters or associations. The mass distribution is well described by a power law dN\/dM ~ M^{-3} between 10^6 to 5 x 10^7 solar masses. This result suggests that cluster formation proceeds hierarchically on all scales within this range. In addition we find evidence for two distinct populations of massive clusters; one population has ages less than 100 Myr while another older population appears to be coeval at ages greater than 300 Myr. These results suggest that there may have been multiple episodes of intense cluster formation over the past few hundred million years. Finally, we compare our observations to theoretical models of cluster evolution and find good agreement when assuming a Kroupa IMF."}
{"text":"We present new optical and near-infrared photometry obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) in order to study the late-time evolution of the supernova remnant N132D, which is associated with the type Ic supernova SN2002ap.

The best-fit parameters are consistent with those found previously using ground-based data. However, we also find evidence for additional flux at wavelengths longer than 1 micron after day 1000. This excess emission may arise from dust formed during the explosion or subsequent interaction between the ejecta and circumstellar material. In addition, our HST images reveal several bright knots along the southern edge of the remnant. These knots appear to have been ejected recently as they show no signs of fading over time scales ranging from months to years."}
{"text":"We relate the notion of information-theoretic security to that of computational indistinguishability, and show how this relationship can be used in practice for proving security properties of cryptographic protocols.  We also present an algorithm which transforms any protocol secure against passive adversaries into one secure against active ones (under some reasonable assumptions). The transformation preserves all communication complexity measures such as round-complexity or number of messages exchanged between parties.   Finally we give examples where our approach is useful by applying it to prove security of several well-known protocols. In recent years there has been much interest in developing techniques for analyzing the security of cryptographic protocols. One important goal is to develop tools for showing that certain protocols are secure with respect to various definitions of security. For example, many researchers have studied the problem of transforming a protocol secure only against passive attackers into one secure against active attackers. This problem was first considered by Canetti et al., who gave a general solution based on universal composability [Can01] . However their method does not preserve communication complexity measures like round-complexity or message-exchange patterns. Subsequently, Micali proposed another transformation [MIC02] , but his technique requires additional assumptions about the underlying primitives being used."}

{"text":"We present an analysis of the kinematic properties of the ultra-faint satellites (UFS) of the Milky Way, using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the Dark Energy Survey. We find that all UFS are consistent with being on circular orbits around their host galaxy, which is in agreement with previous studies. However, we also show that this result can be explained by assuming that these galaxies have been tidally disrupted over time. In particular, we demonstrate how tidal disruption could explain both the observed number density profile as well as the velocity dispersion profiles for each satellite system. Finally, we discuss our results within the context of other recent work studying the missing satellite problem. The discovery of more than 100 new dwarf galaxies orbiting the Milky Way has led to renewed interest in understanding the formation history of the Local Group. While many of these newly discovered systems appear to follow similar scaling relations to those found among brighter dwarfs such as the classical dwarf spheroidal galaxies, there remain several puzzling differences between them. For example, while most bright dwarfs exhibit significant rotation velocities, only one of the recently discovered faintest satellites shows any evidence of rotation . Furthermore, while the majority of bright dwarfs lie close to the virial radius of the Milky Way , nearly half of the fainter satellites reside at distances greater than 300 kpc .\nIn addition to these observational challenges, theoretical models predict that dark matter halos should contain far fewer subhalos than are currently known to exist .

{"text":"We use the Millennium Simulation to study how close pairs of galaxies evolve into galaxy clusters, and we show that they are good proxies for mergers between dark matter halos.  We find that most (>80%) of the mass in galaxy clusters is assembled through mergers with other galaxy clusters or groups rather than by merging individual galaxies.   The merger rate increases strongly towards higher redshifts, but it decreases rapidly at lower masses because of dynamical friction.

We use these results to place limits on the number of massive dark matter haloes that are not associated with LRG hosts in the local universe. The halo occupation model we employ is based upon an extension of the HOD formalism developed by Zheng et al.

The SNR is located in the constellation Puppis at a distance of ~5 kpc, which corresponds to its angular size of about 30 arcmin. We find that the spectrum of this object can be described by two thermal components with temperatures T1=7\u00d710^6 K and T2=2\u00d710^6 K. In addition, we detect non-thermal emission above 10 keV. Using these parameters, we estimate the age of the SNR as t=4000 yr. This value agrees well with the characteristic time for the expansion of the shell into the surrounding medium. Based on our analysis, we conclude that the observed morphology of the SNR is consistent with the model of a spherical explosion expanding into a uniform interstellar medium."}

{"text":"We propose that the dark matter in our universe is composed of neutrinos with masses and mixings similar to those observed for ordinary neutrinos, but which are neutral under all Standard Model gauge groups except U(1)B\u2212L.

{"text":"We report the discovery of massive outflows (1000 km s-1) in two post-starburst galaxies, which are thought to be progenitors of present-day elliptical galaxies. The observations were made with Subaru\/FOCAS and VLT\/VIMOS using near-infrared spectroscopy covering rest-frame optical emission lines for these objects at redshift 0.6. We found that both galaxies show strong [O III]5007\u00c5\/H\u03b2 ratios indicating high ionization parameters. In addition, we detected blueshifted high-velocity components in H\u03b1 profiles as well as broad wings on their H\u03b1 line profiles.

{"text":"We present new near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy and photometry for the brightest star in the young open cluster M82F, which is located at a distance of 3.6 kpc to the south-east of the nearby galaxy NGC 3077. The NIR spectrum shows that this object has an effective temperature T eff = 13000 K and surface gravity log g = 4.0 dex. We find no evidence for any infrared excess emission indicative of circumstellar dust around the star. Using our spectroscopic results we derive a mass of about 20 M\u2299 for the central star. This value agrees well with previous estimates based on optical spectra. From the observed luminosity and assuming solar metallicity we estimate a radius R\u22c6 \u2248 5R\u2299 for the central object.

{"text":"We present new constraints on the time evolution and duration of dark energy using measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in galaxy surveys, combined with supernovae type Ia data.

The current accelerating epoch began around redshift z = 0.6, and is continuing to accelerate today. This picture is consistent with standard \u039bCDM cosmology but differs significantly from other models such as quintessence or modified gravity theories. These results are based on the WiggleZ Dark Energy Survey, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7, and the Union2 compilation of supernovae type Ia observations.

The resulting sample consists of 16,000 objects selected between redshifts 2<z<8.

We find that our calculated values agree very well with previous theoretical work but disagree significantly with experiment. This is attributed mainly to the fact that we use an atomic orbital basis set which does not include diffuse functions. \n \n Keywords: Polarizability tensor; Hyperpolarizability tensor; Clustering; Density-functional theory; Basis set; Diffuse functionals; Lithium cluster; B3LYP functional. 1 Introduction \n \n In recent years there has been considerable interest in studying the optical properties of small metal clusters due to their potential applications in optoelectronic devices such as lasers [1] , light-emitting diodes [2] , solar cells [3] , etc.. These materials can be used either directly or incorporated into more complex structures [4] . For example, it was shown recently that gold nanocluster films could be prepared on glass substrates [5] . It should also be noted that these materials may exhibit interesting nonlinear optical effects [6] .\n \nThe study of the optical response of clusters requires knowledge about both linear and nonlinear optical susceptibilities [7, 8] . The latter quantity describes how strongly the material responds when exposed simultaneously to two or more laser beams [9] . A convenient way to calculate this property is through the so-called sum-over-states approach [10] where one calculates the imaginary part of the third-order susceptibility \u03c7(3) (\u03c91, \u03c92, \u03c93). Here, the frequencies \u03c9i correspond to different wavelengths of incident radiation. If all three frequencies coincide then the corresponding susceptibility is called the static hyperpolarizability \u03b20 [11] ."}
{"text":"We have performed simulations of nova explosions using the hydrodynamic code VH-1, which includes nuclear burning and convection. We find that changes to reaction rates can significantly affect the results of these calculations. In particular, we show how different choices for the 12C(p,\u03b3)13N rate lead to differences in the predicted light curve shapes.  The inclusion of this reaction is important because it affects the amount of 13N produced during the explosion. This isotope decays by electron capture into 14O, which then undergoes \u03b2+ decay back down to 14N. If there are too many electrons present at late times (due to an overabundance of 13N), they will be captured onto protons instead of being emitted as positrons; thus, less energy will be released than if no such process were occurring. Our results suggest that the current uncertainty in the 12C(p , \u03b3 )13N rate may cause errors in the predicted luminosity of up to 50%."}

{"text":"We study the interplay between thermal percolating states and jammed states in disordered systems by using Monte Carlo simulations for dimers adsorbing onto binary alloy surfaces with different compositions. We find that there is an optimal composition at which both types of states coexist, leading to a maximum entropy production rate. The coexistence state has been observed experimentally as well. Our results provide new insights into how energy can be transferred most efficiently through complex networks. Energy transfer efficiency plays a crucial role in many physical processes such as heat conduction [1] , chemical reactions [2] , and biological transport [3] . In particular, it determines whether or not a system will reach equilibrium [4] .\nIn this work we focus on one specific type of non-equilibrium process -thermal percolation [5] . Thermal percolation occurs when particles are injected randomly into a network [6] . Particles then diffuse along the network until they encounter each other [7, 8] . When two particles meet, their energies combine irreversibly [9] . This leads to a cascade-like spreading of particle density [10] . As more particles are added, the number of clusters increases [11] . Eventually these clusters merge together [12] forming a single cluster spanning across the entire network [13] . At this point all particles have combined into a giant cluster [14] . It was shown recently [15] that the transition from isolated clusters to a single connected cluster corresponds to a phase transition [16] . For example, in the case of random resistor networks [17] , the transition temperature T c depends only on the average resistance R av [18] :\n, where k B is Boltzmann's constant [19] . However, if the distribution of resistances P (R) is broad enough [20] , the transition becomes first-order [21] ."}
{"text":"We present new constraints on planet formation timescales by combining infrared photometry and spectroscopy with optical data to study the circumstellar environments of young stars in nearby open clusters. We find that most weak-lined T Tauri stars (WTTS) have disks, but only half as many show evidence for accretion onto their central star. The fraction of WTTSs showing signs of accretion decreases rapidly between ages of 1 Myr and 3 Myr. This suggests that disk dispersal is an important process during this period. In addition, we find that the distribution of dust temperatures in these systems evolves significantly over time. These results are consistent with models where planets form quickly after the dissipation of the protoplanetary disk. However, our sample size is small and additional observations will be needed before firm conclusions can be drawn about how planet formation proceeds. \n \n Keywords: Open cluster, Circumstellar disk"}

{"text":"The nullstellensatz is an important theorem in algebraic geometry, which states that if a system of polynomial equations has no solution over some field then it must have at least one solution over its algebraic closure.

The authors would like to thank Professors David Avis and Michael Shmoys for their helpful comments during the preparation of this manuscript. The nullstellensatz provides a powerful tool for solving certain classes of computational problems expressed as systems of polynomial equations. It states that if such a system does not admit any solutions over a given field K, then there exists at least one solution over the algebraic closure of K. In this paper, we present a general method for transforming combinatorial optimization problems into systems of polynomial equations whose solvability can be determined using the nullstellenstaz. Our approach relies on representing each feasible solution of the COP as a point in a vector space V equipped with a suitable inner product. Then, we express the objective function of the problem as a linear combination of polynomials in V . Finally, we formulate the problem as a system of polynomial equations by requiring that all points corresponding to feasible solutions satisfy the objective function simultaneously. As examples, we apply our technique to three well-known NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems: Maximum Clique, Minimum Vertex Cover, and Maximum Independent Set."}
{"text":"In this article, we introduce the notion of affine structures on ringed spaces in order to study schemes over rings with non-trivial units. We show that every scheme can be equipped with an affine structure which is unique up to isomorphism. This result allows us to define the category of schemes as a full subcategory of the category of affine structures on ring spaces. In particular, it follows that any two morphisms between schemes are isomorphic if they have the same source and target. Finally, we prove that the category of schemes has all small limits and colimits. The main results of this work were presented at the conference \"Algebraic Geometry\" held in June 2005 in Stony Brook (USA).

{"text":"The first stars in the universe were born out of primordial gas clouds, which collapsed under their own gravity to form dense cores that ignited nuclear fusion and became hot white dwarfs.

INTRODUCTORY REMARkS\nThe motion of many biological systems is often described as being driven by internal forces or active processes [1] . Examples include bacteria swimming through fluids [2] , cells crawling on surfaces [3] , and molecular motors moving along cytoskeletal filaments [4] .\nIn recent years there has been growing interest in understanding the dynamics of these active particles [5] - [8] . In particular, it was shown that their behavior may differ significantly from that observed in passive Brownian particles [9] - [11] . For example, while the latter exhibit normal diffusion at large timescales [12] , active particles typically display superdiffusive [13] or even ballistic [14] transport depending on the details of their interactions [15] - [17] . This difference arises because active particles have additional degrees of freedom which allow them to explore more efficiently the available space [18] . As a result they tend to move faster than passive particles [19] .\nRecently we introduced a model describing the motion of a single active particle [20] . It consists of a point-like object that performs a biased random walk in a periodic potential [21] . Its position x(t + 1) = x(t) + v t+1 \u2212 v t is determined by its velocity v t+1 = f [x(t), v t ] where f [\u00b7] denotes some deterministic force acting upon the particle [22] .

{"text":"We study the phase diagram of a model system consisting of particles interacting via an attractive Yukawa potential, which is balanced by a short-range repulsive term. We show that this simple model can reproduce many features observed in experiments on colloidal suspensions near their glass transition temperature Tg. In particular we find that for temperatures below some critical value Tc there exists a metastable liquid state characterized by strong density fluctuations. The relaxation time of these fluctuations diverges at Tc as predicted by mode-coupling theory (MCT). Above Tc the equilibrium state consists of a disordered gas-like phase. For large values of the coupling constant between the two potentials the gas-liquid coexistence line ends in a first-order phase transition to a solid state. This transition occurs close to the MCT prediction for the ideal glass transition point. Our results are obtained using molecular dynamics simulations combined with free-energy calculations based on thermodynamic integration techniques. \n \n 1 Introduction \n \n Glass-forming liquids exhibit fascinating properties such as non-exponential relaxation [1\u20133] or dynamic heterogeneity [4\u20136]. These phenomena have been studied extensively over several decades [7\u20139] but still remain poorly understood. One reason for this lack of understanding lies in the fact that glassy systems are out of thermal equilibrium [10] so that standard statistical mechanics methods cannot be applied directly. However, it has recently become possible to investigate glassy states experimentally [11\u201313] and numerically [14\u201318]. A particularly interesting class of glass-formers comprises colloidal suspensions [19\u201321] whose slow dynamics can be probed by light scattering [22]. It was found that the relaxation times diverge when approaching the so-called glass transition temperature T g . Close to T g , the relaxation process becomes extremely slow and the system falls out of equilibrium within experimental observation times [23]. Therefore, one usually studies the dynamics of colloids well above T g where they behave like normal fluids [24]. Nevertheless, even in this regime the relaxation processes are not completely understood [25]."}
{"text":"We present an analysis of the Galactic latitude distribution of stars in the 2MASS survey, and find that it is well described by a superposition of two Gaussians with different widths. The narrower Gaussian has a mean latitude of $-2^{\\circ}$ , while the broader one peaks at $+3^{\\circ}$ . We show that this double-Gaussian model can be used to explain the observed latitude dependence of the number density fluctuations as measured by the power spectrum of the 2MASS all-sky map. \n \n In addition we demonstrate how our results are consistent with previous studies on the subject. Finally, using the derived parameters of the double-Gaussian model, we calculate the expected value of the quadrupole moment of the CMB temperature anisotropy induced by the Galaxy's gravitational potential.

{"text":"We introduce the notion of covering homology, which is an extension of ordinary homology to infinite graphs and simplicial complexes. The main idea behind this concept is that we consider not only finite subcomplexes but also their infinite analogues - so-called coverings. We show how covering homology can be used for studying properties of infinite graphs such as amenability or hyperbolicity. In particular, we prove that if a graph has infinitely many ends then its first covering homology group vanishes. This result generalizes the classical theorem by Stallings on groups with infinitely many ends. Covering homology provides us with new tools for investigating various classes of infinite objects in mathematics. It turns out that it is closely related to other concepts like equivariant homology theory (in the case when our object admits actions of some group) or higher-order algebraic K-theory. Finally, we present several examples illustrating applications of covering homology."}

INTRODUCTORY REMARkS\nThe Random Field Ising Model (RFIM) has been introduced more than 50 years ago [1] . It describes a ferromagnetic material where each spin interacts only with its nearest neighbors via exchange interactions J ij , while it also feels an external magnetic field h i randomly oriented on different sites [2] .\nIn recent years there have been many studies devoted to this problem both experimentally [3] - [6] and theoretically [7] - [12] . This interest was triggered mainly by the fact that the RFIM shares some features with real systems such as diluted antiferromagnets or spin-glasses [13] - [15] . For example, the presence of quenched disorder leads to frustration effects [16] similar to those observed in spin-glass materials [17] . Moreover, the RFIM displays a rich variety of phases depending on the strength of the applied magnetic field [18] . At low fields one finds a paramagnetic phase, whereas above a certain threshold value H c = O(J), the spins align along the direction of the local magnetic field leading to a ferromagnetic state [19] . Finally, if the magnitude of the external field exceeds another threshold value H t > H c , the magnetization becomes discontinuous [20] . These three regimes are separated by two second-order transitions occurring at T c1 < 0 and T c2 > 0 [21] . However, despite these analogies between the RFIM and experimental systems [22] , the exact nature of the phase diagram remains controversial [23] ."}

{"text":"We study information diffusion on networks with multiple communities, where each community has its own set of nodes and edges. We propose an epidemic model that captures the effect of both global and local interactions between users within different communities.

Our main goal is to understand how the structure of the underlying network affects the spreading process. In particular, our contributions include:  1. We develop a novel mathematical framework to analyze the dynamics of information diffusion under the proposed epidemic model. 2. We show that if all communities have similar sizes then the number of infected nodes at time t grows as O(t log n), where n denotes the total number of nodes in the network. 3. We prove that if one community dominates the other ones by size then the number of infected individuals grows exponentially fast. 4.

Moreover, we show that the fraction of cooperators increases as the temptation to defect decreases or the cost-to-benefit ratio increases.

PACS numbers: 04.20.-q, 11.10.-z, 98.80.Cq  A fundamental question about the nature of dark matter has been whether it consists of one or more species of particle. If so, what are their masses? What interactions do they have with ordinary matter? How much dark matter does each galaxy contain? These questions motivate us to study models for which the dark matter is described by some field theory living on a higher dimensional spacetime manifold. \n \n Here we will focus on a class of solutions where the extra dimension is compactified on a circle $S^1$. Such configurations were first studied in [1] , where it was shown that if the fifth dimension is small compared to the other length scales involved then the gravitational potential felt by observers on the brane is indistinguishable from that produced by a point-like source located at the center of the sphere. However, when the size of the extra dimension becomes comparable to the radius of curvature of the brane, the gravitational force law changes dramatically [2] . \n \n In [3] , Randall and Sundrum showed that such a configuration could provide a natural explanation for the hierarchy between the weak scale and the Planck scale. They considered a 5D anti-de-Sitter space with two 3-branes embedded along its boundary. One of these branes represents our universe, while the second acts like a mirror image of ours. Matter fields are localized near either brane, but gravity propagates freely throughout the entire bulk."}
{"text":"We present the results of our analysis on the supersymmetric parameter space, taking into account all available experimental data including those from LHC experiments as well as electroweak precision observables (EWPO). We find that there is no significant improvement over previous analyses when we include EWPOs with their full correlations taken properly into account. However, if one considers only the subset of EWPOs which are not strongly correlated to each other, then some improvements can be seen for certain regions of the parameter space. In particular, this applies to scenarios where the lightest neutralino has a large Higgsino component or where the gluinos have masses around 1 TeV. The latter case also leads to an improved agreement between theory predictions and measurements of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. Finally, we discuss how these findings affect the prospects for discovering supersymmetry at future colliders such as the International Linear Collider."}
{"text":"We present an analysis of the first two years (Feb 2005 -Jan 2007) of data taken by the Swift satellite, which has been designed to detect and study gamma ray bursts (GRBs). We find that GRB 050904 at z = 6.3 is the most distant object ever detected in the electromagnetic spectrum. The prompt emission was observed over more than four orders of magnitude in energy, from radio waves up to X-rays. This burst also had one of the highest fluences recorded so far for any GRB. In addition we report on another burst, GRB 080913, whose afterglow was found to be variable on timescales as short as 1 minute. These results are discussed within the context of current models for GRB production. Keywords: Gamma-ray burst, High-redshift universe, Afterglows, Swift satellite. Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), intense flashes of high-energy radiation lasting only milliseconds, have now been discovered out to redshifts greater than six [1] . Their extreme luminosities make them powerful probes into the early Universe [2] , but their origin remains unknown [3] .\nSwift [4] , launched in November 2004, carries three instruments capable of detecting GRBs across the entire electromagnetic spectrum [5] : the Burst Alert Telescope [6] detects GRBs via their X-ray and\/or optical emissions; the Ultraviolet\/Optical Telescope [7] observes the afterglow through ultraviolet and visible light; and the X-ray telescope [8] monitors the afterglow's decaying flux.

{"text":"We present new observations with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and Chandra X-ray Observatory to study the properties of ionized gas in galaxy clusters at z ~ 0.5-0.8, where most massive clusters are found today.  We find that the fraction of cool core clusters is higher than expected for their redshifts based on local samples. The observed evolution may be due to an increase in the number density of active galactic nuclei or AGN activity over time. In addition, we detect extended emission line regions around some of these clusters which have been previously identified as having strong cooling flows. These results suggest that there has been significant heating of the intracluster medium by energetic outflows associated with AGNs since z = 1.0. This work was supported by NASA grant NAG5-9998. Cooling flow clusters are known to contain large amounts of cold gas within their central regions. However, it remains unclear how this gas cools down without forming stars. Recent studies show that many of them also harbor powerful radio sources near their centers. It is possible that such radio jets heat up the ICM through shocks and\/or turbulence generated during the interaction between the jet plasma and the ambient hot gas."}

The instability leads to the formation of vortex rings which are then advected outward by the flow. In addition we find that there exists another type of non-axisymmetric instability at higher values of $\\Omega_c$. This instability results in the generation of spiral waves which can be seen as an analogue of Rossby waves observed in planetary atmospheres. Finally, we discuss how these results may affect the spin evolution of young pulsars. Superfluidity plays an important role in many astrophysical phenomena such as the cooling of white dwarfs or the structure of neutron stars. It has been shown recently that superfluid turbulence could explain the rapid spindown of young pulsars [1] . However, despite its importance, our understanding of superfluid hydrodynamics remains incomplete due to the lack of direct experimental observations."}
{"text":"In this talk, we will discuss the relationship between the Thurston norm and normal surfaces in 3-manifolds.  We will begin by recalling some basic definitions about the Thurston norm on homology classes of surface bundles over circles (or equivalently, mapping tori).  Then, using techniques developed by Gabai, we will show that any class with positive Thurston norm can be represented by an embedded surface which is incompressible and not boundary-parallel.  Finally, we will give examples to illustrate how these results are used to study the topology of hyperbolic 3-manifolds. The Thurston norm was introduced in 1982 as part of the solution to the Geometrization Conjecture for Haken manifolds.   It assigns each element of $H_1(M;\\mathbb{R})$ a non-negative real number, where $M$ is a closed orientable 3-manifold.  This assignment satisfies certain natural properties, including additivity under connected sums and multiplicativity under finite covers.  In particular, if $M_1$ and $M_2$ are two closed orientable 3-manfolds whose fundamental groups have isomorphic subgroups of finite index, then there exists a constant $C > 0$ such that $||[\\phi]||_{Th} = C ||[\\psi]||_{Th}$ whenever $\\phi : \\pi_1 M_1 \\to \\pi_1 M_2 \\cong H_3$ is a homomorphism inducing isomorphism on all subgroups of finite index.

{"text":"We consider the problem of estimating an unknown field in R^d based on noisy measurements taken by randomly deployed binary sensors. The measurement process is modeled as follows: each sensor takes one bit of information about its local environment and transmits it to a fusion center via a wireless link; at the fusion center, these bits are combined into estimates for the underlying field. We assume that there exists some prior knowledge regarding the structure of this field (e.g., smoothness), which can be used to design efficient estimators. In particular, we propose two classes of estimators: non-parametric estimators with fixed bandwidths, and adaptive estimators whose bandwidths vary according to the local properties of the field being estimated.  For both types of estimators, we provide performance guarantees under various assumptions on the noise model and the spatial distribution of the sensors. Finally, we present numerical results illustrating our theoretical findings."}
{"text":"We study the formation and control of Liesegang patterns in an electrochemical system by applying external electric fields to modulate the local concentration gradients during precipitation reactions.  We show that, under certain conditions, the applied field can be used as a guiding field to direct the growth of precipitate bands along specific directions. The results are explained using a simple model based on the competition between diffusion and reaction rates at different locations within the sample. This work provides new insights into how chemical systems may self-organize through interactions with their environment. Chemical systems often exhibit complex spatial structures such as stripes or rings which form spontaneously without any externally imposed symmetry breaking [1] . These structures have been observed in many natural phenomena including mineral deposits [2] , biological tissues [3] , and even living organisms [4] .\nThe most famous example is the so-called \"Liesegang ring\" formed when two solutions containing metal ions react chemically [5] . In this case, the initial solution contains both cations (e.g., Ag+) and anions (e.g., Cl-). When these two solutions come into contact, they begin to diffuse across each other until they meet another interface where the opposite charges neutralize one another [6] . At some point after mixing, precipitation occurs leading to the formation of a band of solid material separating the original solutions [7, 8] . As more bands grow, they eventually overlap forming concentric rings around the center of the sample [9] . Although the exact mechanism behind the formation of Liesegang rings remains unclear [10] , it has been shown experimentally that the spacing between successive rings depends strongly on the concentrations of the starting solutions [11] ."}
{"text":"We present an explicit expression for the irreducible form of the metric variation of the action term in sixth order gravity, which is valid to all orders in perturbation theory. We also show that this result can be used to derive an approximate expression for the stress energy tensor of the gravitational field. The results are applied to study the evolution of cosmological perturbations during inflation driven by a scalar field with non-canonical kinetic term. In particular we find that the non-Gaussianity generated at second order in perturbation theory does not vanish even if the background geometry is exactly de Sitter space-time. This implies that the bispectrum produced by such models cannot be described solely in terms of local shape functions as it was previously thought. \nI. INTRODUCTORY REMARK\nIn recent years there has been renewed interest on higher derivative theories of gravity motivated mainly by their possible role in quantum gravity phenomenology (see e.g. ), but also because they provide interesting alternatives to standard General Relativity (GR) in the context of modified gravity scenarios . However, despite these efforts, our understanding of the physical consequences of these theories remains incomplete due to technical difficulties associated with the analysis of their solutions. One of the main obstacles comes from the fact that the equations of motion derived from these actions contain derivatives of arbitrarily high order, making them difficult or impossible to solve analytically. A way out of this problem consists in expanding the fields around some fixed background solution and truncating the resulting series expansion after a finite number of terms. Although this approach allows one to obtain useful information about the dynamics of the system under consideration, it fails to capture important features like back-reaction effects between different modes of the same field or interactions among different fields. For example, in the case of inflationary cosmologies based on higher derivative gravity, the truncated perturbative expansions do not reproduce correctly the observed level of primordial non-Gaussianities .\nA more systematic method to deal with these problems involves the use of covariant techniques developed originally within the framework of GR. These methods allow us to express the equations of motion in a manifestly gauge"}
{"text":"We consider the problem of finding a shortest path between two nodes in an undirected graph with non-negative edge weights, subject to the constraint that no node can be visited more than once along this path.  We show how to solve this problem by reducing it to the minimum cost flow problem on a directed acyclic network and then applying standard techniques for solving such problems.   The running time is O(n3 log n), where n denotes the number of vertices in the input graph. This result improves upon previous algorithms which have been known only for special cases (e.g., when all edges are unit-weight).    Keywords: Shortest paths, Minimum-cost flows, Directed graphs, Undirected graphs, Culminating paths, Constraints, Flow networks, Computational complexity theory.    1 Introduction\n\nIn many applications one needs to find a shortest path between two given nodes s and t in an undirected weighted graph G = (V , E) without allowing any vertex to appear twice or more times in the path.   For example, if we want to compute the distance between two cities using road maps, we may not allow a city to be used as a starting point again after visiting another city.   In other words, we do not want to use the same road segment twice even though there might exist several different ways to reach some destination.   Another application arises in computational biology, where one wants to find a sequence of genes that minimizes the total length while avoiding certain regions of DNA.   A third application occurs in computer vision, where one seeks to minimize the total length of a path through a set of images while ensuring that each image appears at most once in the path.   Finally, our results also apply to the problem of computing the diameter of a connected undirected graph.\n\nThe first algorithm for computing the shortest path satisfying these constraints was presented by Hassin and Rubinov [HR91] who showed how to reduce the problem to the minimum cost flow"}

We show that higher order antibunching can be observed when the atom is initially prepared in an excited state or ground state superposition. The effect is more pronounced if the initial state has some population on the excited state. This phenomenon may have applications in quantum information processing. \n \n Introduction:-In recent years there has been considerable interest in studying nonclassical properties of radiation fields generated by atoms [1] . In particular, it was shown that the photon statistics of such systems are governed by the first-order coherence function g (1) (\u03c4) [2] , which describes bunching behavior at short times and anti-bunching at longer times [3] . It is well known that this property arises due to destructive interference between different pathways leading to emission of photons [4] .\nRecently, several authors studied the effects of spontaneous emission on the second-order correlation functions [5] - [8] . They showed that the presence of spontaneous emission leads to sub-Poissonian statistics [6]-[8] . However, these studies were restricted only to the case where the atom interacts with a single mode of field. On the other hand, many experiments involving atoms interacting simultaneously with multiple modes of electromagnetic field have also been performed [9] - [11] . For example, in Ref. [10] , the authors investigated the influence of vacuum fluctuations on the fluorescence spectrum of a three-level system driven by two laser beams. In addition, they found that the intensity noise of the emitted light depends strongly on the relative phase difference between the driving lasers. Motivated by these experimental results we consider here the problem of calculating the second-order correlation function of an atom interacting simultaneously with two modes of light [12] ."}

We find that the deflection angle is significantly affected by the AE vector field even for small values of the coupling constant $\\alpha$. The total magnification factor also depends strongly on $\\alpha$ through the angular separation between the two images. In particular, we show that the image splitting can be suppressed when $\\alpha$ takes large negative value. This may provide us a possible explanation to the observed absence of multiple images around some supermassive black holes such as Sgr A* at the Galactic center. \nI. INTRODUCTIO N\nThe recent detection of gravitational waves has opened up new windows into the universe [1] . One of the most important goals of future space-based gravitational wave detectors will be to detect gravitational waves emitted during inspiral phase of compact binaries [2] , which would allow us to test general relativity (GR). However, it remains unclear whether GR is valid or not beyond the weak-field regime [3] .\nIn this context, recently proposed theories of modified gravity have attracted much attention [4] . Among them, Einstein-AEther (EA) gravity [5] is one of the simplest extensions of GR [6] . It introduces a dynamical unit timelike vector field called \"aether\" whose dynamics is governed by the Lagrangian density,\nwhere $T_{\\mu \\nu}$ denotes the energy-momentum tensor of matter fields, $\\partial_\\mu V^\\mu = 0$ is required by the Lorentz invariance, and $AE_{\\mu \\nu} = \\partial_\\mu V^\\nu - \\partial_\\nu V^\\mu$ represents the AE vector field strength.

{"text":"We present new near-infrared spectroscopy of the evolved star V4332 Sgr, which is believed to be in an advanced stage of its final red giant phase. We find that it has developed a strong infrared excess due to dust formation at temperatures between 1000-2000 K. This suggests that the object may have undergone a recent episode of enhanced mass loss on a time scale of years or decades prior to our observations. In addition we detect emission lines of hydrogen and helium indicating ongoing mass loss. These results are consistent with previous suggestions that this object underwent a late thermal pulse (LTP), i.e., a rapid increase in luminosity followed by a period of high mass loss. If so, then the LTP would have occurred within the last few hundred thousand years. Based on these findings we propose a revised evolutionary model for V4332 Sgr including a VLTP event as well as a subsequent superwind phase."}

The LF shows that there are more bright LRGs than faint ones in all samples except for the sample selected only by photometry. This result suggests that we can obtain better statistics if we combine both selection criteria. In addition, our results show that the number density of LRGs decreases as the cluster mass increases. On the other hand, the CMRs do not depend strongly on the cluster masses or redshifts. These results suggest that the formation epoch of massive elliptical galaxies may be earlier than that of less massive ones. \n \n\n Keywords: Luminous Red Galaxies"}
{"text":"We present the first exact solution for inflation in string theory, which is based on an explicit compactification to four dimensions with N=1 supergravity and chiral matter fields. The model contains two scalar fields, one of them being responsible for slow-roll inflation driven by its potential energy density. We show that this field can be identified as the inflaton. In addition we find another scalar field whose kinetic term has negative sign. This field may play the role of dark radiation during inflation. Finally, we discuss some phenomenological consequences of our results. Introduction: Inflation [1] provides a simple explanation for many puzzles associated with the early universe such as flatness, homogeneity and horizon problems [2] . It also predicts primordial fluctuations [3] , which are now confirmed by observations [4] .\nThe simplest models of inflation involve only one scalar field (inflaton) rolling slowly down its potential [5] . However it was shown recently [6] that there exist more general classes of inflationary scenarios where several scalars contribute to the total energy density driving inflation [7, 8] . These new possibilities open up interesting avenues towards understanding the physics behind inflation [9] .\nIn particular, if at least one of these scalars has positive kinetic energy then it leads to so-called k-inflation [10] . On the other hand, if all the scalars have negative kinetic energies they lead to so-called ghost inflation [11] . Both types of inflation were studied extensively in recent years [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59 ].\nIt should be noted however that most of these studies assume that the background geometry is given by Minkowski space-time or anti-de Sitter space-time [60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65,"}
{"text":"We study the vibrational density of states (VDOS) of glassy materials using molecular dynamics simulations with anharmonic interactions between particles. We show that the VDOS can be decomposed into three main contributions: one at low frequencies corresponding to acoustic phonons; another contribution centered around the Debye frequency which is associated with optical phonons; and finally a third contribution located at high frequencies whose origin lies on the presence of unstable modes. The latter are responsible for the appearance of the so-called boson peak in the VDOS. In addition we find that these unstable modes have a strong tendency to form clusters or groups of correlated particles. Finally, by analyzing the spatial distribution of the unstable modes it becomes evident that they tend to localize near regions where there exist structural defects such as icosahedral-like motifs. This localization effect leads us to propose a simple model based on the existence of two different types of sites within the materials: stable ones characterized by their ability to support vibrations over large energy ranges, while unstable sites only allow small-amplitude oscillations."}

We find no evidence for additional companions to either host star down to masses as low as 5 MJup within separations of 10 AU. Both systems have orbital eccentricities consistent with zero. These results suggest that hot Jupiters can survive close encounters with other stars during their formation or early evolution.  - Introduction \n \n Hot Jupiters are massive gaseous planets on short-period orbits about solar-type stars. They represent one of the most extreme environments in our Solar System, but they may be common among nearby Sun-like stars. In fact, recent surveys indicate that roughly 20% of sun-like stars harbor such planets . However, these planets are thought to form beyond several AU before migrating inward through interactions with the protoplanetary disk and\/or gravitational scattering by other bodies. This raises questions regarding how these planets manage to avoid being ejected into interstellar space after undergoing strong dynamical interactions with other objects while still retaining sufficient angular momentum to reach their current locations near their parent stars .\n\nIn this Letter we report the detection of two new \"hot Jupiter\" planets using high-precision radial velocity measurements obtained over more than eight years with the High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher instrument (HARPS), which is installed on the European Southern Observatory's 3.6-m telescope located at La Silla Observatory in Chile. One of these planets has an extremely small semi-major axis of just 0.04 AU, making it one of the closest known exoplanets to its parent star."}
{"text":"We study the statistical properties of highly compressible turbulence by means of direct numerical simulations (DNS) at Mach numbers ranging between 10 and 100, using both isothermal and adiabatic equations of state for the gas.  We find that the scaling laws observed in incompressible flows are violated when the Mach number becomes large enough to produce shocks. In particular, we show that the energy spectrum exhibits an exponential decay with wavenumber k instead of the power-law behavior E(k) ~ k-5\/3 predicted by Kolmogorov's theory. The intermittent nature of the flow is also investigated through the analysis of probability density functions (PDFs). It turns out that PDF tails become increasingly fat-tailed as M increases, which can be explained by invoking the presence of shock waves. Finally, we discuss how these results may affect our understanding of astrophysical phenomena such as supernova remnants or interstellar clouds."}

Introduction: Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are large-scale expulsions of magnetized plasma from the Sun's corona into interplanetary space. They play an essential role in driving geomagnetic storms and are believed to be responsible for many other phenomena such as solar energetic particles [e.g., Reames et al. (1998) , Kahler & Ragot (2007) ], solar radio bursts [e.g., Aschwanden (2004)] , and white-light flares [e.g., Benz (2008) ]. CME initiation involves the destabilization of a current sheet formed below the erupting flux rope through reconnection processes [e.g., Forbes & Priest (1995) ; Lin & Forbes (2000); Aulanier et al. (2010) ]. However, it remains unclear how this process leads to the acceleration of the bulk plasma outflow along open magnetic fields lines. Recent observations suggest that the initial phase of the eruption is characterized by the formation of a narrow jet-like structure called a \"flare loop\" or \"sheath\" [e.g., Liu et al. (2009a Liu et al. ( , 2009b ; Cheng et al. (2011); Jiang et al. (2012"}

{"text":"We present results on the metal cooling function for cosmological simulations, including both primordial and secondary coolants (H$\\alpha$, CII, OI, SiIII, Fe). We find that the inclusion of metals has little effect on the temperature distribution at z>5 but significantly affects it below this redshift. The effects are more pronounced when we include photo-ionization heating by UV background radiation. In particular, we show that the gas density profiles become shallower with decreasing redshifts due to stronger radiative losses near galactic centers. This leads to an increase in the central galaxy masses as well as the number densities of low-mass galaxies. These changes can be understood within the framework of our analytic model which is based on the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium between gravity and pressure gradients. Our results suggest that the observed properties of high-z Lyman break galaxies may not be reproduced without taking into account the presence of heavy elements. \n \n Keywords: Cosmology"}

We also observe that the peak positions shift depending on the strength of magnetic field applied perpendicularly to the atomic plane. These results show good agreement with theoretical predictions based on exact diagonalization method for finite-size systems. \n \n Introduction \n \n Fractional quantum hall effect (FQHEs), discovered more than twenty years ago [1] , has been one of most fascinating phenomena in condensed matter physics [2] . In this phenomenon, electrons or holes form incompressible states at certain fractions of Landau levels under strong magnetic fields [3] . Recently, it was shown theoretically [4] and experimentally [5] that such effects can be observed even without external magnetic fields if particles have internal degrees of freedom like spin [6] - [8] .\n \nIn recent experiments [9] - [11] , we succeeded in observing FQHEs in ultracold gases confined to twodimensional planes.

This allows us to study the properties of FQHEs in higher dimensions [27] - [29] ."}
{"text":"We prove that there exists an open set of initial data such that the corresponding solution to the rapidly rotating shallow water (RSW) or Euler equations is globally smooth in space-time, provided it stays sufficiently close to some equilibrium state. The proof relies on a combination of energy estimates with suitable weighted Sobolev inequalities. We also show how our results can be extended to more general systems of conservation laws which are not necessarily strictly hyperbolic. In particular we consider the case where one of the characteristic speeds vanishes at a point but remains bounded away from zero elsewhere. \nIntroduction\n\nThe purpose of this work is twofold.

{"text":"We introduce the concept of neutral networks, which are graphs that represent relationships between sequences and shapes in an unsupervised manner. We show how these can be used for shape recognition by training them on synthetic data generated using computer graphics techniques. The resulting network is able to recognize shapes with high accuracy even when they have been transformed or distorted. Finally we demonstrate our method on real world images showing its ability to generalize well beyond the training set. In this work we present a novel approach to learning about shapes through their relationship to sequences. Our main contribution is introducing the concept of neutral networks as a way to learn such relationships without supervision. Neutral networks are graphs whose nodes correspond to sequences (e.g., strings) and edges connect similar sequences. They provide a natural representation for capturing relationships between different types of information. For example, one could use a neutral network to capture relationships between sentences and documents, or between music notes and melodies. Here we focus on applying neutral networks to the problem of recognizing shapes based solely on their sequence of points sampled along their boundary. This task has many applications including medical image analysis where it may not always be possible to obtain ground truth labels due to privacy concerns."}
{"text":"We present new results on the kinematics and dynamics of the circumnuclear region (CNR) of NGC 1097, based on integral field spectroscopy with SINFONI at VLT\/UT4.

The latter shows blueshifted emission lines indicating radial velocities between -500 km\/s and -1000 km\/s relative to systemic velocity. This outflow has been previously detected using optical IFU data as well as HST imaging. In addition we detect a second slower outflow component perpendicular to this one, which extends over 3 kpc towards north-east direction. Both outflows are likely driven by nuclear jets originating from the central engine.

{"text":"We report on an experiment to measure decoherence in a quantronium qubit using the cavity bifurcation amplifier (CBA). The CBA is used as a dispersive readout device for the quantronium, and we show that it can be operated at high bandwidths without significant back-action noise or added phase noise. We demonstrate measurement times up to 1 ms per data point while maintaining quantum-limited sensitivity. This allows us to perform measurements over many relaxation cycles of the system, which are necessary to extract information about its dynamics. In addition, we use this technique to study the effect of different environmental conditions on the coherence time of our system. Our results indicate that the CBA has great potential for future experiments studying open quantum systems. Quantum mechanics predicts that macroscopic objects such as atoms will exhibit wave-like behavior when they interact with light fields. However, these predictions have not been experimentally verified because measuring the properties of individual particles requires extremely sensitive detectors. Here, we present a new method for detecting single photons based on a nonlinear optical process known as parametric down-conversion. Using this approach, we detect single photons emitted by a trapped atom interacting with a laser field inside a high-finesse optical cavity. By coupling the output of the cavity into a second cavity containing a nonlinear crystal, we generate pairs of entangled photons whose frequencies differ by twice the frequency of the pump beam. These photon pairs are then detected simultaneously by two silicon avalanche photodiodes operating in Geiger mode."}

Their luminosities range between 1043 erg\/sec and 1044 erg\/sec in the 0.5-10 keV energy band. In addition we find evidence that there is diffuse emission around these sources. This emission has a temperature of about 3 keV and its spectrum can be fitted by a thermal plasma model with solar abundance ratios. From our analysis it appears that this gas may have been heated up recently due to shocks produced during mergers or interactions among subclusters. Finally, we also detected extended soft emission surrounding both AGN candidates. Its origin could be either thermal bremsstrahlung radiation from hot gas or inverse Compton scattering off relativistic electrons."}

{"text":"The mechanical properties of hair are determined by its molecular structure, which is mainly composed of proteins called keratins. The main structural unit in keratins is an alpha-helical coiled coil that forms microfibrils with other similar units to form intermediate filaments (IFs). These IFs then aggregate into bundles forming macrofibrils, which are further bundled together to form the basic building blocks of hair -the cortical cells-. In this work we have studied how the mechanical properties change as these structures evolve during the process known as maturation or ageing. We used confocal Raman spectroscopy to measure the changes in the secondary structure of individual keratin fibres extracted from human scalp hairs at different stages of their growth cycle. Our results show that the elastic modulus increases significantly when the fibre goes through the transformation from the alpha helix conformation to the beta-sheet one. This increase can be explained by the formation of hydrogen bonds between neighbouring strands of the protein backbone. Moreover, our measurements reveal that the presence of water molecules has a significant influence on the mechanical behaviour of the fibres."}

The only exception is LP 944-20 which has been shown to be a member of the Hyades supercluster by its proper motion.  These results confirm previous suggestions that most brown dwarfs have ages less than 100 Myr. They also show that there may exist two populations among the very low-mass stars and brown dwarfs: those associated with open clusters\/associations and those apparently not gravitationally bound to any cluster. This suggests that either some brown dwarfs form outside open clusters and\/or they evaporate rapidly after formation.

Among various approaches developed so far, statistical modeling techniques have attracted much attention because they can provide more accurate solutions than deterministic ones [1] . Statistical modeling techniques are usually divided into parametric and nonparametric categories depending on whether or not there exists any prior knowledge about the underlying distributions [2] .\nThe most popular parametric technique is probably the mixture model which assumes each pixel belongs to one of several classes [3] , where the number of components needs to be specified beforehand [4] . However, the choice of the optimal number of components remains difficult since different numbers may lead to very similar results [5] . To overcome these difficulties, some researchers have recently introduced new types of mixture models [6] - [8] . For example, Banerjee et al. [9] presented a hierarchical Dirichlet process mixture model (HDP-M) which allows the number of clusters to grow automatically during the clustering procedure; while Ishwaran & Zarepour [10] proposed a finite normal mixture model (FNMM), which uses a truncated Gaussian density instead of a Dirac delta function to represent each cluster's probability mass function. Although both HDP-M and FNMM can avoid specifying the number of clusters manually, their computational complexity increases dramatically when dealing with high-dimensional problems [11] ."}
{"text":"We present new high-precision photometric observations of the red giant star nu Indi, obtained with the Kepler space telescope over a period of three months (Q0-Q3). The data are used to determine the acoustic spectrum of this star by means of Fourier analysis techniques. We find that the observed frequencies can be well reproduced using theoretical models for stars on the red-giant branch. In particular we show that the large separation between consecutive radial orders is consistent with an evolutionary stage corresponding to a stellar mass of about 1.5 Msun. Furthermore, we use our results to estimate the lifetimes of individual modes as a function of their degree . Our findings suggest that low-degree p-modes have significantly longer lifetimes than those predicted by current theory. This may indicate that convection plays only a minor role in driving these modes or that additional physical processes need to be taken into account. \n \n Keywords: Red giants"}
{"text":"We report on the continuous loading of $1^{{\\rm S}}_{0}_0$ calcium atoms in a magneto-optical trap (MOT) by using a Zeeman slower and a MOT with counterpropagating beams.

We also measure the lifetime of the trapped atoms as a function of the detuning between the cooling laser frequency and the atomic resonance frequency. This measurement shows that the lifetime decreases when the detuning increases due to spontaneous emission. Finally we study the dependence of this lifetime on the intensity of the trapping lasers. These results are compared to theoretical predictions based on Monte Carlo simulations. \nThe experiment was performed in the Laboratoire Kastler Brossel at Ecole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure de Paris. \n \n In recent years there has been considerable interest in studying cold atom physics both for fundamental reasons and because it offers new possibilities for applications such as quantum information processing [1] or precision measurements [2] .

The source reached its highest recorded state ever detected at TeV energies during this period. We present results based on data taken simultaneously with Swift-XRT and UVOT instruments that show no significant change in X-ray or optical emission properties over the course of the outburst. This suggests that the high-energy emission is produced via inverse Compton scattering off relativistic electrons located close to the central black hole rather than synchrotron radiation emitted by particles accelerated up to high Lorentz factors within the jet itself. These findings are consistent with theoretical models where particle acceleration takes place in shocks formed when jets collide with surrounding clouds.

The first set is based on the Padova code while the second one uses the Geneva code. For each track we calculate synthetic spectra using the SPECTRUM code. These synthetic spectra are then used as input to determine the best-fit parameters of observed high-resolution optical spectra of Galactic open clusters. Our analysis shows that both codes produce similar results when fitting these cluster data. However, there are significant differences in the derived ages depending on which code was used. This discrepancy can be explained by the fact that the Padova tracks have been calculated without convective overshooting whereas the Geneva tracks include this effect."}

The main goal of this work was to investigate how the dust extinction evolves as a function of galaxy mass and star formation rate density over cosmic time. Our analysis shows that there are two different populations of LBGs: one population has low stellar masses (M*=10^10-10^11 Msun), high specific star formation rates (SSFR>100Gyr-1), and relatively small amounts of dust; while another population consists of more massive systems (M*>10^11Msun), lower SSFR values (SSFR<30Gyr-1), and higher levels of dust extinction.

{"text":"We present an analysis of the nonlocal phenomenology in magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence with strong magnetic field anisotropy, which is relevant to solar wind and space plasmas. We show that the energy transfer rate between different scales can be described by a simple formula based on the local nonlinear interactions only when the wavevector directions are aligned or anti-aligned with respect to the mean magnetic field direction. In other cases, we find that the nonlocal effects become important due to the presence of oblique waves. The results obtained here may provide useful insights into understanding the nature of turbulent transport processes in astrophysical plasma environments. Turbulence plays an essential role in many physical phenomena ranging from geophysics to fusion physics [1, 2] . It has been shown recently that there exist universal statistical properties shared among various types of turbulent flows [3] , such as Kolmogorov scaling [4] , intermittency [5] , and anomalous dissipation [6] .\nIn particular, it was found that the statistics of fully developed turbulence depend crucially on how fast the energy cascades down through the inertial range [7, 8] . This cascade process involves both linear and nonlinear interactions between different modes at different wavenumbers [9] . For example, in hydrodynamics, the energy flux \u03a0(k) \u2261< |\u03b4u k \u00b7 \u03b4u * \u2212k | 2 > \/ < u 2 k > depends not only on the magnitude of the wavenumber k but also its orientation relative to the large-scale flow [10] .

We find that for thinner films there is an increase in oxygen deficiency as measured by XPS and XAS. This leads to a decrease in Curie temperature TC = 240 K down to 180 K with decreasing film thickness. In addition we observe a reduction in magnetization M0 below 20 nm which can be explained by the presence of a ferromagnetic dead layer near the interface. Using X-ray magnetic circular dichroim (XMCD), we show that this ferromagnetic dead layer has a net moment along the out-of-plane direction but no in-plane component.

In one regime (weak disorder), the system shows Anderson localization behavior; while in another regime (strong disorder) it exhibits Bose glass behavior. The transition point depends strongly on the filling fraction of particles per site. For low fillings, this transition occurs at relatively small values of disorder strengths. However, for higher fillings, the transition to the Bose glass phase takes place only when the disorder becomes very strong. This suggests that the presence of interactions can significantly affect the nature of the ground state of the system even if they are weak compared to other energy scales such as the bandwidth or the disorder strength. \n \n Introduction \n \n Disorder plays an important role in determining many properties of condensed matter systems. It has been shown recently that disorder can lead to interesting phenomena like quantum Hall effect [1] , metal-insulator transitions [2] , and superconductivity [3] . One of the most studied models which incorporates both disorder and interaction effects is the so-called Anderson model [4] . In its simplest form, this model describes non-interacting electrons moving through a disordered medium. Although the original formulation was restricted to electronic degrees of freedom, it has also been extended to describe various physical situations involving interacting particles [5] - [8] .\n \nIn recent years, ultracold atoms have emerged as promising candidates for simulating complex quantum mechanical problems [9] - [11] . These experiments provide us with unprecedented control over all relevant parameters of the problem under consideration [12] - [14] . Moreover, these systems allow us to explore new physics beyond what is possible in conventional solid-state materials [15] - [17] . Ultracold atomic gases trapped in optical lattices offer unique opportunities to investigate the interplay between disorder and interactions [18] - [20] . Recently, several experimental groups [21] - [23] have observed signatures of Anderson localization [24] in cold atom systems by studying the transport properties of the gas across the lattice."}
{"text":"We study central limit theorems for estimators of parameters in linear regression models where errors are not necessarily normally distributed but have an elliptical distribution, and we allow some explanatory variables to be non-normal. We show that under suitable conditions on the model coefficients, the asymptotic distributions of these estimators can be approximated by those obtained when all the explanatory variables follow a multivariate normal distribution. The results are illustrated through simulation experiments. Keywords: Central Limit Theorem; Elliptical Distributions; Regression Modeling. 1 Introduction In many applications it is assumed that the response variable follows a Gaussian distribution while the predictors may or may not be normally distributed. For example, this assumption has been used extensively in econometrics (see e.g., Greene [2003] ). However, there are situations where the data generating process does not satisfy such assumptions. This motivates us to consider more general classes of distributions which include as special cases both the normal and nonnormal distributions. One class of distributions that includes most common probability density functions encountered in practice is given by the so-called elliptical distributions. These distributions were introduced independently by Kelker [1970] , H\u00fcsler and Reiss [1981] , and Fang et al. [1987] . They are characterized by their dependence structure rather than their marginal densities. A random vector X = (X1, ..., Xd)T \u2208 Rd belongs to the family of elliptical distributions if its characteristic function satisfies E[exp(itX)] = exp{\u2212V (t)},\nwhere V : R \u2192 [0, \u221e) is called the characteristic generator. If V \u2261 0 then X is said to belong to the family of spherical distributions. Examples of elliptical distributions include:"}
{"text":"We study how mergers affect the kinetic SZ effect in galaxy clusters, and show that they can significantly enhance it by up to an order of magnitude at intermediate redshifts (0 < z < 1). We find that this enhancement is due to the fact that mergers increase both the gas temperature and density profiles within the cluster core region. The latter leads to higher values of the Comptonization parameter y, which describes the strength of the SZ effect. In addition we demonstrate that mergers also lead to significant changes in the shape of the pressure profile inside the cluster core. This results in a change of sign of the integrated SZ flux decrement, which becomes positive during merger events. Finally, we discuss possible observational signatures of these effects using current data sets as well as future surveys such as Planck. Galaxy clusters are known to be dynamically active systems with frequent mergers between sub-clusters or even individual galaxies. These mergers have been shown to produce observable effects on various physical properties of galaxy clusters including their X-ray luminosity, temperature distribution, optical morphology, and gravitational lensing mass measurements. However, little attention has so far been paid to the impact of mergers on the kinetic SZ effect produced by galaxy clusters. Here we present detailed numerical simulations of galaxy clusters undergoing major mergers, and investigate how mergers influence the kinetic SZ effect. Our main findings are:"}
{"text":"We propose that the dim radio-quiet neutron star, 1E1207.4-5209 (hereafter E1207), is an evolved object with its surface temperature T = 2 \u00d7 10 6 K and radius R = 11 km. The observed X-ray luminosity Lx ~ 3\u00d71033 erg s-1 can be explained by the decay energy of radioactive nuclei produced in the core collapse supernova explosion at t ~ 1s after the birth of the progenitor star. We show that the total amount of 56Ni synthesized during the explosion is about 0.1M\u2299 which agrees well with the theoretical prediction for massive stars. In addition to the nuclear burning, we consider the effects of magnetic field decay due to ohmic dissipation as well as gravitational wave emission. It turns out that these processes are not important enough to explain the present state of E1207 within our lifetime. However, if the initial magnetic field strength was larger than 1013 G, it could have been reduced down to the current value of 5\u00d71012 G through ohmic dissipation before the age of the universe reached 13Gyrs."}
{"text":"We present results on INTEGRAL observations of the X-ray burster (XRB) KS 1741-293, which is located in the globular cluster NGC 6388 at a distance of about 12 kpc. The source was discovered by BeppoSAX and has been observed several times since then with different satellites. We report here on data obtained during an observation performed between February 24th and March 1st 2004 using the IBIS\/ISGRI detector on-board INTEGRAL. During this time we detected two bursts from the source. In addition to these bursts, we found that there are significant variations in the hard Xray flux over short periods of time. These short-term variabilities can be explained as being due to rapid changes in the accretion rate onto the compact object or possibly due to precession of the neutron star's magnetic field axis. This work shows how important it is for future missions like XEUS and Constellation-X to have good timing capabilities in order to study such sources."}
{"text":"We report on saturation effects observed in the sub-Dopplerbroadened absorption spectrum of cesium atoms confined to a cell with thickness L = 0.5 mm and length l = 1 cm, which is much thinner than the Doppler width (~30mm). The experimental results are compared with theoretical predictions based on the solution of Maxwell-Bloch equations for two-level systems under conditions where the relaxation rates depend strongly on the atomic density. We find that our model describes well both the shape and intensity dependence of the saturated absorption lineshape as well as the linewidths at different intensities. Our measurements show that the optical depth per unit area increases by more than one order of magnitude when going from thick cells to extremely thin ones. This opens up new possibilities for high-resolution spectroscopic studies using such samples. \n \n In recent years there has been growing interest in studying dilute vapors confined inside very thin cells [1] . These experiments have led to important advances in understanding many phenomena related to quantum optics [2] , nonlinear optics [3] , laser cooling [4] , and precision measurement [5] .\nIn this work we present some interesting features of the sub-Doppler-broadened absorption spectrum [6] of cesium atoms confined within an extremely thin cell [7, 8] . Such a sample can be considered as a quasi-two-dimensional gas [9] whose properties differ significantly from those of three-dimensional gases [10] . For example, it was shown recently [11] that the relaxation rate \u03931 of the excited state population depends strongly on the atomic density n0 due to dipole-dipole interactions between neighboring atoms [12] . As a result, the effective homogeneous broadening of the transition becomes dependent on the number N of atoms contained in the probing beam volume V [13] : \n \n \u0394\u03bdeff ~ N\/V \n\n\nwhere \u0394\u03bdD is the Doppler width associated with the thermal motion of the atoms along the direction perpendicular to the probe beam axis.

The survey consists of deep imaging observations of 16 globular clusters with metallicities ranging between [Fe\/H] = -2.2 to -0.7. We have used these data along with archival WFPC-2 images taken under programs GO-5269 and GO-6366 to study the properties of horizontal branch stars in each cluster. \n \n In this work we use theoretical stellar evolution tracks, isochrones, luminosity functions, and synthetic HB models to determine ages, reddenings, distances, helium abundances, and mass loss rates for all sixteen clusters studied here. Our main conclusions are summarized below: \n \n \n \n 1. Ages - We find that most of the clusters analyzed here appear younger than previously thought based upon their location relative to the fiducial ridge line defined by the Milky Way's old open clusters. This result suggests that either the age scale derived using open clusters may be systematically too young or that there has been significant dynamical evolution within many of the clusters since they formed. \n \n 2. Reddening - We find evidence for differential reddening across several of the clusters studied here. However, it appears that the majority of the clusters do not suffer from large amounts of differential reddening. For those clusters where we can measure individual reddenings for different populations of stars, we find no systematic differences between the values determined for blue stragglers versus normal giants. These results suggest that any differential reddening affecting these clusters must occur over scales smaller than the typical size of an open cluster. \n \n 3. Distances - Using the absolute magnitudes of RR Lyrae variables observed in each cluster, we derive distance moduli which agree well with previous estimates made using other methods such as main sequence fitting.

{"text":"We demonstrate that it is possible to generate all four Bell states in one single nonlinear crystal by using two pump beams with orthogonal polarizations and slightly different wavelengths, which are generated via second-harmonic generation (SHG) inside an optical parametric oscillator (OPO). The OPO consists of a periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN) crystal as nonlinear medium and a concave mirror for cavity feedback. We show experimentally that this approach allows us to obtain high-visibility quantum interference between photons emitted at degenerate wavelength pairs across the entire PPLN acceptance bandwidth. This method can be used to simplify future experiments on continuous-variable entanglement distribution over large distances. \n \n Quantum information processing requires the ability to create and manipulate entangled states of light. In particular, the Bell state measurement plays a key role in many applications such as teleportation or quantum repeaters [1] . However, generating these highly nonclassical states is challenging because they require indistinguishable photon pairs [2] , which cannot be produced deterministically [3] .\nIn recent years, several approaches have been developed to overcome this problem [4] . One possibility is based on spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC), where a pump beam creates correlated pairs of signal and idler photons [5] . By adjusting the relative phases of the pump fields [6] , it has become possible to produce any desired superposition of the four Bell states [7, 8] . Another option uses squeezed vacuum states [9] or displaced number states [10] instead of coherent laser pulses [11] . These methods allow for efficient generation of entangled states but usually suffer from low visibility due to imperfections [12] ."}
{"text":"We present an analysis of gravitational lensing by large-scale structure in the universe, as traced by neutral hydrogen (HI) at high redshifts z > 6. We use numerical simulations to show that this effect is detectable with future radio telescopes such as SKA and ngVLA. The signal-to-noise ratio for detecting these effects depends on the angular resolution of the telescope used; we find that it can be improved significantly if one uses multiple frequency channels instead of single-frequency data. This technique could provide valuable information about dark matter halos at early times when they were still forming their first stars. In addition, our results suggest that the cosmic web may have been denser than previously thought. Finally, we discuss how this method could be applied to detect primordial black holes. Introduction -Gravitational lensing has become a powerful tool for studying the distribution of mass in the Universe. It allows us to probe structures which are too distant or small to be detected directly through other means. For example, galaxy clusters act like lenses, magnifying background galaxies behind them. By measuring the distortion caused by lensing, one can infer properties of the cluster's dark matter halo [1] . Similarly, weak gravitational lensing measurements allow astronomers to map out the total projected mass density field over large areas of sky [2] .\nIn recent years there has been growing interest in applying gravitational lensing techniques to study high-redshift objects [3] , including the epoch of reionization [4] . However, most previous studies focused only on the lensing produced by visible matter, such as galaxies and quasars [5] . Here we consider another source of lensing: the intergalactic medium (IGM). At very high redshift, before galaxies formed, the IGM was filled with neutral hydrogen gas [6] . As time passed, some fraction of this gas became ionized due to ultraviolet radiation emitted by young stars [7, 8] . But even today, much of the IGM remains neutral [9] . Since the IGM contains more mass than any individual galaxy [10] , its contribution to lensing should not be ignored [11] .\nThe goal of this"}
{"text":"We study the concentration-mass relation for dark matter haloes in cosmological N-body simulations with different initial conditions and resolutions, focusing on the dependence on halo mass and redshift. We find that the concentrations are well described by an empirical formula proposed recently by Navarro et al. (2004) : c = c0(M\/M0)^a(z), where M is the virial mass of the halo, z its formation time (defined as the epoch when half of the final mass was assembled into progenitors), c0 ,a and M0 are free parameters to be determined numerically. The best-fit values of these parameters depend only weakly on the simulation resolution or the initial power spectrum index n. In particular, we show that the value of a0 is independent of both n and the numerical resolution. This result suggests that the concentration of dark matter haloes may not be universal but depends on their formation history."}
{"text":"We study the profinite complex associated to a family of smooth projective curves over a field k with fixed genus g>0. We show that this is homotopy equivalent to the classifying space of the group Aut(C) of automorphisms of one curve C in the family (Theorem 1). This result generalizes previous results by Deligne on families of elliptic curves. In particular we obtain new information about the cohomology groups H^1(Aut(C),k*) for all such families (Corollary 2).\nIn section 3 we use our results to prove some basic facts about the anabelian geometry of the moduli stack M_g of stable curves of genus g. For example we give a simple proof of the fact that the Picard scheme Pic0M_g has no torsion points if char(k)=0 or p>3g-2 (Proposition 4). The main tool used here are the results obtained in sections 1-2 combined with Grothendieck's comparison theorem between \u00e9tale fundamental groups and Galois groups."}
{"text":"The magnetic properties of carbon nanotubes and fullerenes have been studied extensively, but the effect on their electronic structure is still not well understood. In this work we use density functional theory to investigate how the presence of an external magnetic field affects the electronic structure of single-wall zigzag (n = 3) and armchair (n = 4) nanographenes with different sizes. We find that for small n=3 or n=4 nanographenes there are no significant changes in the band gap when applying a magnetic field up to 10 T along the tube axis. However, as the size increases, the energy gaps decrease significantly under applied fields due to the formation of Landau levels. The results show that the magnetic response depends strongly on the chirality of the nanographene. For example, while the zigzag tubes exhibit diamagnetic behavior at low fields, they become paramagnetic above 1 T. On the other hand, the armchair tubes always display paramagnetic behavior even at very weak fields."}
{"text":"We present an analysis of the Bondi accretion rate onto primordial black holes (PBHs) during the radiation-dominated era, taking into account the effects of pressure and viscosity on the gas flow. We find that for PBH masses M \u226b 10^(10) g, the Bondi radius is much larger than the Schwarzschild radius, so that the standard Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton formula can be used to calculate the accretion rate. For smaller mass PBHs with M < 10^(10)g, we use numerical simulations to determine the accretion rate as a function of time. The results are compared against those obtained by assuming that the accreting gas has negligible pressure or viscosity. In addition, we consider the possibility that the accreted gas may cool efficiently via bremsstrahlung emission before it reaches the central BH. Finally, we discuss how our results could affect the abundance of PBHs at different redshifts."}

We have analyzed the temporal behavior of this source using both the PDS method developed by Norris & Bonnell (2006) and the standard power law decay model.

{"text":"We present new photometric and spectroscopic observations of the classical nova EX Hya made in October 2005, when it was still bright (V = 8 mag). The light curve shows that EX Hya is an intermediate polar with a period of P orb = 0.084 d. We find evidence for two accretion regions on the white dwarf surface which are responsible for the double-peaked emission lines observed during outburst. In addition to these features we also detect narrow absorption components at velocities up to -1500 km s-1 . These absorptions may be caused by material ejected during previous eruptions. Our results show that EX Hya has returned to quiescence after its latest eruption in September 2002. Classical novae have been known since antiquity but their underlying physics remains poorly understood. They are believed to result from thermonuclear runaways triggered by unstable nuclear burning on the surfaces of white dwarfs (WD) in close binary systems. However, there remain many open questions about how this process takes place and what happens afterwards. One such question concerns the nature of the WD magnetic field. It is generally accepted that the WD magnetic field plays a key role in determining whether or not a system will undergo a thermonuclear runaway. If the WD magnetic field is too weak then no runaway occurs; if it is strong enough then the WD can become fully convective leading to stable hydrogen burning and hence preventing any further outburst activity. This picture is complicated however by the fact that some WDs do exhibit periodic outbursts despite having fields thought to be too weak to prevent them becoming fully convective. Such objects are called Intermediate Polars (IPs), where the WD magnetic field is sufficiently strong to synchronise the spin periods of both stars but does not disrupt the flow of matter onto the WD."}
{"text":"Epsilon Aurigae is an F-type main sequence star with a mass of 1.8 M\u2609 and radius 2 R\u2609, located at about 40 light-years away in the constellation Auriga.  It has been known for many years to be surrounded by dusty material that obscures its visible spectrum.   The infrared excess emission detected around this object suggests it may have a circumstellar disk similar to those found around young stars such as T Tauri or Herbig Ae\/Be stars.   In addition, there are indications that the system contains a close companion which could also contribute to the observed infrared excess emission.    We present new photometric observations obtained using the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope (UKIRT) on Mauna Kea over the period 1997-2001 covering wavelengths between 0.9-2.5 microns.  These data show significant variations in both the near-infrared fluxes and colours of the central source consistent with changes in the amount of dust surrounding the star.  This behaviour is very similar to what is seen in other pre-main-sequence systems where accretion onto the central star causes periodic increases in luminosity accompanied by increased levels of reddening due to heating of the surrounding dust grains.   Our results suggest that the current level of activity in the system is relatively low compared to previous epochs but we cannot rule out the possibility that the recent increase in brightness was caused by a short-lived burst of enhanced accretion rather than steady-state accretion occurring throughout our observing campaign."}
{"text":"We present the results of an optical survey for high redshift galaxies in the field surrounding the radio galaxy PKS 1138-262 (z = 3.9). We have detected over 100 candidate Lyman-alpha emitting galaxies with redshifts between 2 and 5, including several new spectroscopically confirmed members of this cluster. The spatial distribution of these objects is consistent with that expected if they are located within a single dark matter halo centered on the radio source. This result suggests that clusters may be identified by their diffuse emission as well as individual member galaxies. In addition to confirming the existence of a massive cluster around PKS 1138-262 we find evidence for two other overdensities of Lyman-alpha emitting sources near the line-of-sight to the radio source. These structures could represent additional clusters or proto-clusters which will evolve into richer systems like those found today. Finally, our data suggest that there exists a large population of faint Lyman-alpha emitting objects whose properties are similar to those observed locally but whose number density increases rapidly towards higher redshifts."}
{"text":"We study the effect of radiative transfer (RT) on ultraviolet pumping of the 21 cm line at high redshifts, using cosmological hydrodynamic simulations with RT and without it. We find that RT can significantly enhance the strength of the 21 cm signal by up to an order of magnitude compared to calculations neglecting RT effects. The enhancement is caused mainly by Lyman-alpha photons produced inside galaxies which are absorbed outside them due to scattering off neutral hydrogen atoms. This leads to additional heating of the intergalactic medium through photoionization heating and Compton cooling. In addition we show that the inclusion of RT also changes the shape of the power spectrum of the 21 cm brightness temperature fluctuations. Our results suggest that future radio telescopes such as SKA will be able to detect this signal if they have sufficient sensitivity.

We find that the observed number density of lenses is consistent with predictions based on cold dark matter simulations but inconsistent at more than 3 sigma confidence level if we assume a standard thermal relic WDM model with mass mX = 1 keV. This result suggests either that the current WDM scenario needs to be modified or that there are other systematic effects which have not been taken into account in our analysis. The full text can be found at: http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/astro-ph\/0604070v1.pdf . \nThe existence of dark matter has now been established beyond reasonable doubt through its gravitational influence on visible matter. However, despite decades of research, little else about this mysterious substance is known. In particular, it remains unclear whether dark matter consists of one particle species only - as assumed in most theoretical studies -or whether it comprises several different particles. One possibility is that dark matter consists of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), such as neutralinos predicted within supersymmetric extensions of the Standard Model [1] .\nIn order to test these scenarios observationally, astronomers look for signatures of dark matter in astrophysical objects like galaxies [2] , clusters [3] and quasars [4] . A particularly promising method involves searching for gravitationally lensed systems [5] where light rays emitted by distant sources bend around intervening dark matter halos [6] . If dark matter consists of WIMPs then their masses should lie between 10 GeV\/c 2 and 100 TeV\/c 2 [7, 8] . For example, the recently discovered galaxy cluster Abell 2218 [9] may contain a halo made up entirely of WIMPs [10] ."}

The results presented here generalize previous work in this area due to Rokhlin, Kolmogorov-Sinai, Abramovich-Karandikar, and others. 1 Introduction Iterated Function Systems (IFSs), introduced by Hutchinson [Hut81] , have been studied extensively since they were first proposed more than thirty years ago [Whi84] . They provide a powerful tool for modeling many phenomena arising in applied mathematics such as fractals, computer graphics, image processing, and computational biology [Kea98] .\nIn recent years there has been renewed interest in studying properties of IFSs because of their connections to quantum mechanics and statistical physics [BH02] .  For example, it was shown recently that the spectrum of the Laplacian operator associated with a self-similar set coincides with the spectrum of the transfer operator corresponding to the IFS generating the self-similar set [FJ03] . This connection between IFS theory and spectral geometry has led to new insights into the structure of fractal sets [FJ04] .\nThe most basic object associated with an IFS is the attractor, defined as the unique non-empty compact subset A of some metric space X satisfying  \\(\\displaystyle \\bigcap _{i}B_{i}^{(A)}=1\\) , where B^{(A)} denotes the open ball centered at A with radius r>0.

This is consistent with the fact that there exists no graviton state with negative helicity in the massless spectrum of N=8 supergravity. The vanishing property also holds true even if some gravitons carry positive helicities but others do not. \nThe organization of this article is as follows. In section 2, we briefly review the basic properties of N=8 supergravity theory. In section 3, we explain how to calculate the scattering amplitudes in N=8 supergravitvity. In section 4, we give explicit expressions for the tree-level amplitudes. In sections 5-8, we present the results for the 1-loop amplitudes. Section 9 contains discussions about the physical meaning of these results."}
{"text":"The radial distribution of the inner magnetospheric (IM) plasma pressure is studied by analyzing the magnetic field and particle measurements made onboard two satellites at low altitude in the equatorial plane for an intense geomagnetic storm that occurred between March 1-5, 1982 . The results show that there are significant differences in the IM plasma pressure profiles obtained with different satellites. In particular, the pressure profile derived from GEOS-1 observations shows a sharp peak near L = 3 , while those inferred from ATS-6 and GEOS-2 data exhibit much broader peaks around L = 4 . These discrepancies may be due to the fact that these satellites have different orbits which sample different regions of space. It is also found that the pressure profiles inferred from the three satellites agree well when they are shifted outward along the L-shell coordinate system. This suggests that the observed difference in the pressure profiles can be attributed mainly to the spatial variation of the pressure rather than temporal changes."}
{"text":"We present the regularized version of two popular families of evolution codes for general relativity, namely those based on the BSSN formulation and those using the moving puncture approach. The new schemes are designed to be used with any gauge conditions that can be written as first-order differential equations. We show how these schemes can be implemented into existing codes by adding only one extra equation per time step. In addition we provide an explicit expression for the source term appearing in this additional equation which is valid for all gauges considered here. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of our scheme numerically by evolving several test problems including black hole spacetimes containing apparent horizons. Our results indicate that the new scheme performs well even when evolved over many dynamical timescales.

{"text":"We propose that gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are the result of collisions between primordial black holes and stars in globular clusters, which occur at rates predicted by current models for GRB production.  We show how this scenario can explain many observed properties of GRBs including their duration distribution, luminosity function, redshift evolution, and beaming fraction.   The proposed model also predicts an observable population of binary systems containing both a star and a PBH, which may provide additional tests to distinguish it from other scenarios. Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs; see Figure 1 ) are intense flashes of high-energy radiation lasting only milliseconds up to several minutes [1] . They have been detected out to redshifts z = 8 [2] , corresponding to ages of less than one billion years after the Big Bang [3] .\nThe most popular explanation for these phenomena is that they arise when extremely massive stars collapse into black holes [4] or neutron stars [5] . However, there are some difficulties associated with this picture [6] :  First, the rate of such events required to produce all known GRBs exceeds predictions based on stellar formation theory [7]; secondly, the energy released during the explosion does not appear sufficient to power the brightest GRBs [8] ; thirdly, the number density of very massive stars decreases rapidly towards higher redshifts [9] , whereas observations suggest that the rate of GRB production increases [10] .  Finally, if GRBs were produced solely through collapsars then we would expect them to be distributed randomly throughout space; however, recent studies indicate that they tend to cluster together [11] .\nIn order to overcome these problems, alternative explanations involving mergers of compact objects [12] , tidal disruption flares [13] , and hypernovae [14] have been suggested.

{"text":"We study the influence of an external magnetic field Bext on the dynamics of a central spin S0 interacting with N spins S1,...,SN-1 in an antiferromagnetically ordered environment, where each spin Si interacts only with its nearest neighbors and is described by the Heisenberg model. We show that for small values of Bext (compared to J), the relaxation rate \u0393(Bext) exhibits a non-monotonic behavior as function of Bext. In particular, we find that there exists a critical value Bc such that \u0393(Bext) decreases monotonically if |Bext| < Bc while it increases monotonically otherwise. The dependence of Bc on the number of spins N is studied numerically using exact diagonalization techniques. \nThe results are explained within a phenomenological approach based on the assumption that the effect of the external magnetic field can be modeled by introducing additional effective interactions between the spins which depend on their mutual distances."}
{"text":"We present the results of our analysis on how to measure dark energy using gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) as standard candles, together with other cosmological probes such as Type Ia supernovae (SNe), baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs), cosmic microwave background radiation anisotropies (CMBAs), galaxy clusters, weak gravitational lensing, and Hubble constant measurements.  We find that GRBs can be used in combination with SNe data sets to determine the equation-of-state parameter w{\\displaystyle w} for dark energy at redshifts z>2.5. The combined constraints are consistent with those obtained by Planck satellite observations alone. In addition, we show that combining GRBs with BAO\/CMBA\/cluster\/weak-lensing\/Hubble-constant data sets leads to tighter constraints than any individual probe or combinations thereof. Finally, we discuss possible systematic effects associated with GRB luminosity functions and their host galaxies."}
{"text":"We have observed the infrared colors (J-H, H-K) for 16 Mira variables with high resolution spectroscopy in order to investigate their relation to intensity ratios of SiO maser lines at 43 GHz. The results show that there is no correlation between these two parameters except for one star. We suggest that this may be due to different physical conditions among individual stars or differences in mass loss rates.  Keywords: Mira variable, Correlation, Infrared color, SiO maser line, Mass loss rate. 1 Introduction Miras are red giant stars which pulsate radially on time scales ranging from 100 days up to several thousand years. They exhibit large amplitude variations in luminosity as well as radial velocity. Their light curves can be described by a simple sinusoidal function with periods longer than about 300 days [1] . These stars are known to produce strong winds [2] , and they also emit intense radio waves [3] .\nThe SiO molecule has been found to exist in many types of astronomical objects such as late-type stars [4] , evolved massive stars [5] , young stellar objects [6] , comets [7] , and planets [8] . It is believed that SiO molecules play an important role in the formation process of dust grains [9] . SiO masers were first detected toward AGB stars [10] . Since then, SiO masers have been studied extensively towards both AGB stars [11] - [13] and post-AGB stars [14] - [16] . Many studies have shown that the properties of SiO masers depend strongly on the evolutionary stage [17] - [20] . For example, it was reported that the peak flux density decreases rapidly during the transition phase from AGB to post-AGB [21] ."}
{"text":"We present an analysis of archival Hubble Space Telescope (HST) data for the stellar cluster associated with the Galactic center's Sgr A* black hole, which we refer to as \"the arches\". We use these observations to determine the mass function and luminosity distribution of stars in this region. The observed number density profile is well-fit by a power law model that has been modified by a Gaussian core at small radii. This yields a best fit value of $\\gamma = 1.7 \\pm 0.3$ for the slope of the underlying mass function between $0.1 - 100 M_{\\odot}$. In addition, we find evidence for two distinct populations of stars within the central arcseconds: one population that follows a power-law mass function similar to that found outside of the central arcsec; another population whose mass function appears to be shallower than the first but steeper than Salpeter."}
{"text":"We present an extension of the Standard Model (SM) with three right-handed neutrinos that is based on the assumption of a spontaneously broken generalized $\\mu$-$\\tilde{\\mu}$-symmetry. The model predicts a complex Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa quark mixing matrix as well as Majorana masses for all three known neutrino species. We show how this scenario can be realized in terms of a renormalizable Yukawa Lagrangian. In addition to the SM Higgs doublet we introduce two scalar fields which are responsible for breaking the electroweak gauge group SU(2)L x U(1). One of these scalars acquires its vacuum expectation value at tree level while the other one develops a non-vanishing vev only after radiative corrections have been taken into account. This leads to a natural explanation why the mass scale of the lightest neutral Higgs boson is close to the Z-boson mass."}
{"text":"The present work is devoted to study the effect of pairing interaction on nuclear properties using the relativistic mean field theory (RMFT). The RMFT has been used for calculation of ground state properties like charge density, single particle energy levels, total binding energy etc., of even-even nuclei with mass number A = 16 - 40. In this approach we have considered two different forms of nucleon-nucleon interactions namely Gogny D1S force and NL3* force alongwith Coulomb interaction. We have also calculated the root-mean-square radius(rms) values by considering various combinations of these forces. It was found that the rms value increases as one goes away from the valley of stability towards the neutron-rich side. This increase can be understood due to the presence of extra neutrons which are loosely bound compared to protons. Also it was observed that the rms value decreases when pairing correlation is included."}
{"text":"The inter-hourly-variability index is proposed to measure geomagnetic activity on hourly basis, which can be used as an indicator for solar wind speed variation over time scales longer than one day.  The IHV index was calculated using hourly values of Kp index during the period 1957-2009. It shows that there are two peaks at about 1965-1970 and 1990-1995 . A linear regression analysis between the IHV index and solar wind speed data obtained by spacecraft observations reveals that they have good correlation with each other. This suggests that the IHV index may provide useful information for long-term prediction of solar wind speed. Keywords: Geomagnetism; Solar wind; Variability index; Prediction modeling; Data mining. 1 Introduction Space weather has been attracting more attention recently because it affects many aspects of human life such as satellite communications, aviation safety, power grids etc. (e.g., [1] ). In particular, solar wind plays important roles in space weather since it carries away magnetic fluxes generated by the Sun's dynamo action [2] , and thus controls the Earth's magnetosphere [3] .\nSolar wind is driven out from the Sun by coronal mass ejections [4] . Coronal mass ejections occur when huge amounts of plasma suddenly escape from the Sun into space [5] . They usually last several hours [6] . Therefore, solar wind speed varies significantly within 24 h [7, 8] . However, most previous studies only focus on the average solar wind speed or daily averaged solar wind speed [9] . As a result, little work has been done on investigating how solar wind speed changes on shorter timescales [10] ."}
{"text":"We study the non-adiabatic current through an open quantum dot connected to two leads with different chemical potentials, which is driven by time-dependent gate voltages applied on both sides of the dot. We show that this system can be described as a \"turnstile\" where electrons are pumped between the leads when the driving frequencies match certain resonances. The effect is robust against disorder and dephasing. This work was supported by NSERC (Canada) and CIFAR (Canadian Institute for Advanced Research). In recent years there has been growing interest in studying electron pumps based on semiconductor nanostructures such as quantum dots or carbon nanotubes [1, 2] . These devices have potential applications ranging from metrology [3] , single-electron transistors [4] , and spintronics [5] .\nIn these systems, charge carriers are transported across the device via sequential tunneling processes [6] . A number of theoretical studies [7, 8] have shown that it is possible to achieve high efficiency in these devices even at room temperature [9] . However, most previous works focused only on adiabatic pumping [10] , i.e., the case where the frequency of the external drive is much smaller than all other relevant energy scales [11] . Recently, several experiments [12, 13] reported large currents generated by nonadiabatic pumping [14, 15] . It remains unclear whether these results can be explained within existing theories [16] .\nHere we consider a simple model of a quantum dot connected to two metallic leads [see Fig. 1(a) ] [17] .

{"text":"We present an optimal algorithm for generating pointed trivalent diagrams, which are combinatorial objects that encode the topology of 3-manifolds. The algorithm is based on a new concept called \"triangulation by flipping\", in which we flip edges of a triangulated surface until it becomes minimal with respect to some criterion. We show how this can be used to generate all possible pointed trivalent diagrams associated to any given triangulated surface. As applications, we give algorithms for computing the Heegaard genus of closed orientable 3-manifolds and for enumerating all prime factorizations of integers into primes less than or equal to n{\\displaystyle n}. In addition, we provide an efficient method for counting the number of pointed triangular maps (a subclass of pointed trivalent diagrams) up to isotopy.

A Heegaard splitting of M is a decomposition of M into two handlebodies V and W such that their common boundary is homeomorphic to M. It follows immediately from the definition that every closed orientable 3-manfiold admits at least one Heegaard splitting. However, there exist manifolds that admit more than one Heegaard splitting; these manifolds are said to have multiple Heegaard splittings. For example, if S is a sphere with three holes then S\u00d7S has four different Heegaard splitttings [O] ."}

{"text":"We study the lightest and heaviest CP-even neutral Higgs boson masses in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) with large values of tan(beta). We find that for large values of tan(betas), there is an upper bound on mH,max which depends only weakly on tan(beta). This upper bound can be as low as 130 GeV if we allow for nonuniversal soft supersymmetry breaking terms. The lower limit on mH,min increases rapidly with increasing tan(beta).  For small values of tan(beta) (tan(beta) < 3), the mass difference between the two CP-even Higgs bosons decreases slowly with increasing tan(beta). However, this decrease becomes more rapid when tan(beta) > 5.  In addition to these results, we also present the dependence of the lightest CP-odd Higgs boson mass on tan(beta). \nI. INTRODUCTORY REMARkS\nThe Minimal Supersymmetric Standard model (MSSM) [1] has been studied extensively over the past few years [2] . It contains many new parameters beyond those of the Standard Model (SM). These include the gaugino masses M1 , M2 , M3 , the higgsino mass parameter \u00b5, the trilinear scalar couplings A f , and the ratio of vacuum expectation values of the two Higgs doublets tan(beta).\nIn general, it is difficult to obtain analytical expressions for all the physical quantities in the MSSM [3] . Therefore, one usually resorts to numerical methods [4] or approximations [5] .\nRecently, several groups have used approximate techniques [6] - [8] to calculate various properties of the MSSM Higgs sector. In particular, Ref. [7] presents analytic formulas for calculating the masses of the three neutral Higgs bosons in the MSSM upto leading order corrections in 1\/tan(beta). They show that their results agree well with exact calculations [9] ."}
{"text":"We consider the problem of time evolution for quantum fields on the Milne universe, which is an open FRW cosmology with negative spatial curvature and vanishing cosmological constant. We show that there are no normalizable solutions to the Klein-Gordon equation corresponding to massive particles at early times (t \u2192 \u2212\u221e). This result can be understood as follows. The Milne universe has a singularity at t = 0 where all physical quantities diverge. In particular, the energy density diverges like $1\/t^2$ near this point. As a consequence, any particle state localized around $t=0$ will have infinite energy. Therefore it cannot correspond to a physically meaningful solution of the field equations. On the other hand, we find that there exist normalizable states describing massless particles at early times. These states represent gravitons or photons propagating into the past along geodesics towards the big bang singularity."}
{"text":"The dielectric properties, phase transition behavior, and microstructure evolution were investigated for the (0.65[Pb(Ni-1\/3Nb-2\/3)O_3] -0.35PbTiO3) (PNT) ceramics with different sintering temperatures ranging from 850 to 1100 \u00b0C. The PNT samples exhibited high permittivity values up to ~10 4 , low loss tangent below 10 -2 , and large tunability over 30% under an electric field strength of 30 kV\/cm at room temperature. With decreasing temperature down to 77 K, the permittivity increased slightly while the loss tangent decreased significantly due to the freezing out of mobile ions. At cryogenic temperatures, two relaxation processes were observed in the frequency range between 1 Hz and 100 kHz. The first process was attributed to the grain boundary effect; it shifted towards higher frequencies as the temperature decreased. The second process was associated with ferroelectric domain wall motion; its relaxation time constant remained almost unchanged when the temperature changed."}
{"text":"The authors present the results of their study on the scattering between two protons and one neutron, which is known as the triton channel in nuclear physics.  They use an effective field theory to calculate the cross section for this process at low energies (below 100 MeV) using lattice QCD data obtained by other researchers.   The resulting theoretical predictions are compared with experimental measurements made over several decades by various groups around the world.    The agreement between experiment and theory is found to be good within uncertainties. This work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy under Contract No. DE-AC02-05CH11231. In nuclear physics, there has been much interest recently in studying the interactions among three particles - specifically, how they affect the properties of nuclei such as helium-3 or carbon-12.  These processes can occur when high-energy cosmic rays strike Earth's atmosphere; however, it may also be possible that these reactions play some role in the formation of heavy elements during stellar evolution.  For example, scientists have proposed that helium-4 could form through a series of fusion reactions involving helium-3 and neutrons.  However, before we can understand what happens inside stars like our Sun, we need to know more about the fundamental interactions involved in these types of reactions.  To help us learn more about them, physicists at MIT used lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD), a technique similar to those employed in high energy experiments but performed on computers instead of accelerators, to predict the behavior of certain nuclear reactions.  Specifically, they studied the reaction p+p+n --> d+d+n, where \"p\" stands for proton, \"n\" for neutron, \"d\" for deuteron, and \"d+\" means a positively charged deuteron.

The primary star has evolved off the main sequence but still retains some hydrogen in its atmosphere; it is therefore classified as a subdwarf B (sdB). Our results are consistent with previous determinations based on photometric observations. However, our analysis provides more accurate values because we have used higher quality spectroscopic data than were available previously. In addition, we have been able to determine the individual masses rather than just their ratio. This work was supported by NASA grant NAG5-13523."}
{"text":"We study the non-Markovian evolution of bipartite Gaussian states under local dephasing noise and global squeezing interaction with an environment at finite temperature. We show that, for any initial state, there exists a critical time beyond which the system becomes separable. The critical time is determined by the initial state's purity and the environmental temperature. For pure initial states, we find that the critical time decreases monotonically as the temperature increases; while it first decreases then increases when the initial state has mixedness. In addition to this general result, we also present some specific examples where the critical times are analytically obtained. Our results provide useful insights into the effect of environmental temperature on the entanglement dynamics of open quantum systems. Introduction:-Entangled states play important roles in many fields such as quantum information processing [1] , condensed matter physics [2] , and quantum optics [3] . It is well known that the presence of external environments can lead to the loss of entanglement [4] . Therefore, understanding how the entanglement evolves in noisy environments is crucially important both theoretically and experimentally [5] .\nIn recent years, much attention has been paid to studying the entanglement dynamics of quantum systems [6] - [8] . However, most previous works have focused only on Markovian processes [9] - [11] or special types of initial states [12] - [14] . Recently, several authors studied the entanglement dynamics of two-mode Gaussian states [15] - [17] . They found that the entanglement decays exponentially fast if one mode undergoes phase damping (or amplitude damping) [18] ; however, it may decay slowly even though the other mode experiences strong dissipation [19] . Moreover, they showed that the entanglement revival occurs periodically [20] . These studies were mainly based on numerical simulations [21] . Very recently, analytical solutions were presented [22] - [24] . Nevertheless, these investigations did not take into account the effects of environmental temperatures [25] - [27] ."}

{"text":"We present an ab initio study of the structure, energetics, and dynamics of water adsorbed on the MgO(001) surface in the submonolayer regime using density functional theory with van der Waals corrections. We find that the most stable configuration is one where each oxygen atom binds to three hydrogen atoms forming a trihydrogen bridge between two adjacent O atoms. The binding energy per molecule for this configuration is 1.6 eV. This value agrees well with previous theoretical results obtained within the generalized gradient approximation but disagrees significantly with experimental values which are typically larger by about 0.5-0.7 eV. Our calculations show that the discrepancy can be attributed mainly to the neglect of dispersion interactions in earlier studies. In addition we have studied the effect of temperature on the stability of different configurations. We found that the relative population of various structures depends strongly on the temperature."}
{"text":"We report the observation of measurement-induced dephasing in a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) using Ramsey interferometry and atom counting.  The experiment is performed by splitting a single trapped BEC into two spatially separated clouds, which are allowed to evolve for different times before being recombined on a beam splitter. We observe that the visibility of interference fringes decreases as we increase the number of atoms counted at one output port of the beam splitter. This effect can be explained by considering how repeated measurements affect the phase evolution of the system. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to use cold-atom experiments to study fundamental questions about quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics predicts that any attempt to measure a physical quantity will disturb its value. In this work, we experimentally investigate such effects in a Bose-Einsteint Condensate (BEC). To do so, we perform Ramsey interferometry between two spatially separated regions of our sample. By varying the time spent evolving freely after splitting off part of the initial cloud, we control the relative phase accumulated during free evolution. After recombination, we count the number of atoms arriving at each output port of the beam-splitter and record their arrival-time distribution. As expected, we find that the visibility of the resulting interference pattern decreases when increasing the number of detected particles."}
{"text":"In this article, we prove sharp Lp estimates for the maximal operator associated with the surface measure on a closed convex surface in R3 when p>2.  We also show that these results are optimal by constructing examples where the bounds cannot be improved. The main tool used is an extension theorem due to Coifman and Weiss which allows us to reduce matters to studying the case of surfaces contained in planes. This reduction leads naturally to consideration of certain singular integral operators whose kernels have been studied extensively over the past several decades. In particular, we use recent work of David Jerison and Michael Loss concerning the behavior of such operators near their singularities. Finally, we apply our results to obtain new information about the regularity properties of solutions to the Dirichlet problem for Laplace's equation on bounded domains in R3. Our results can be viewed as extensions of earlier work done by Kenig and Stein who proved similar results for the unit sphere in R4."}

{"text":"We study gravitational interactions between two braneworlds, each with its own brane tension, by using an effective field theory approach that incorporates both Randall-Sundrum (RS) gravity and scalar-tensor theories. We show how this model can be used to describe the dynamics of binary systems such as double neutron stars or black holes. In particular we find that there are new resonant effects which occur when one object is much more massive than the other. These effects lead to large deviations from standard general relativity predictions for the orbital evolution of binaries containing compact objects. The results presented here may have important implications on our understanding of strong-field gravity phenomena like gravitational waves produced during mergers of supermassive black holes at galactic centers. Introduction: Gravitational wave observations will provide us with unprecedented information about the nature of gravity in the strongfield regime [1] . This has led to renewed interest in alternative models of gravity beyond Einstein's general relativity [2] , especially those inspired by string\/M-theory [3] .\nIn recent years it was shown [4] - [8] that many interesting features of these models could be captured within the context of effective field theories where higher-dimensional fields propagate in extra dimensions [9] . One particularly successful class of models consists of so-called braneworld scenarios [10] , where Standard Model particles are confined to live on a four dimensional brane embedded in a five dimensional bulk space-time [11] . A number of authors [12] - [16] have studied the possibility of detecting signatures of braneworld physics through gravitational wave observations [17] - [20] ."}
{"text":"We study the ground state properties of the spin-1\/2 square lattice with nearest-neighbor antiferromagnetic interactions and vacancies, using exact diagonalization (ED) on finite clusters up to 12x12 sites. We find that for low concentrations of vacancies there is no significant change in the magnetic order parameter or the energy gap between singlet and triplet excitations as compared to the pure system. However, we observe an increase in the density of states at zero energy when increasing the concentration of vacancies. This effect can be explained by considering the formation of bound pairs of vacancies which are localized around each other due to their mutual interaction. The binding energies of these pairs depend strongly on the distance between them but only weakly on the size of the cluster considered. In addition, we show how this behavior changes if one considers next-nearest neighbor interactions instead of nearest-neighbor ones. Finally, we discuss possible experimental realizations of our results."}
{"text":"We consider the problem of scheduling jobs on parallel machines with probabilistic anonymity constraints, where each job has to be scheduled in such a way that its execution time is hidden among other jobs. We show how this problem can be solved by using admissible schedulers for the underlying deterministic problem. In particular we present two algorithms based on list-scheduling and randomization respectively. The first algorithm achieves a competitive ratio of 2 while the second one obtains a better performance guarantee of 1 + . Both results are tight up to constant factors. Finally, we provide some experimental evidence showing that our randomized algorithm performs well also in practice. Probabilistic anonymity arises naturally when considering privacy issues related to data mining or computational social choice problems. For example, suppose that there exists a set of n users who have to submit their preferences over m alternatives (e.g., candidates) before a certain deadline T. Each user i submits her preference profile Pi = {(ai1 , bi1 ), . . . , (aim , bim )}, where aij denotes the utility she derives from alternative j and bij indicates whether she likes it or not. Then, if all profiles are submitted simultaneously at time t, they should be processed so as to hide which user prefers what alternative. This means that no information about individual preferences should be revealed until after the deadline T."}
{"text":"The fitting problem is one of the most important problems in cosmology, which has been studied for more than 50 years.  The main goal of this work was to study the effect of different types of initial conditions on the evolution of density perturbations in an expanding universe with a positive cosmological constant (dark energy).  We have used two methods to solve numerically the Einstein equations coupled to the matter fields:  the standard method based on the expansion of the metric tensor into spherical harmonics; and the new method developed by us that uses the expansion of the metric into Chebyshev polynomials.  In both cases we have considered three types of initial conditions: Gaussian random fields generated using the Zel'dovich approximation, Gaussian random fields generated using a fast Fourier transform algorithm, and white noise.  Our results show that all these models give similar predictions at late times when they are evolved up to z = 0.5.  However, there are some differences between them at early times.  These differences can be explained as follows:  the Zel'dovich model predicts larger fluctuations compared to other models because it does not take into account the pressure term in the fluid equation; the white noise model gives smaller fluctuations due to its statistical properties; finally, the Gaussian random fields obtained via the fast Fourier transform algorithm predict intermediate values.  This result shows that the choice of the initial conditions may affect significantly the final value of the power spectrum of primordial density fluctuations predicted by inflationary theories."}

{"text":"We report on the observation and analysis of molecular bound states in ultracold cesium atoms trapped by an optical lattice potential. The molecules are created using magnetic field induced Feshbach resonances at temperatures below 1 microkelvin. We measure their binding energies as functions of both magnetic field strength and laser intensity. These measurements allow us to determine the scattering length between two fermionic atoms with high precision. In addition we observe that the molecule formation rate is strongly enhanced when the trapping lasers are detuned into resonance with excited vibrational levels of the atomic ground state. This effect can be explained by stimulated emission processes which lead to rapid relaxation towards deeply bound molecular states. Finally we demonstrate how these results can be used for precise determination of the s-wave scattering lengths between different spin species. Our work opens up new possibilities for studying quantum many-body phenomena such as superfluidity or supersolidity in systems of interacting fermions. \n \n We present experimental data obtained during our study of ultracold cesium (Cs) atoms confined within an optical lattice trap. Using magnetic field induced Feshback resonances we create weakly bound Cs2 dimer molecules out of pairs of fermionic atoms.

Furthermore we find that the molecule formation process is strongly enhanced if the trapping lasers have a frequency close to one of the atomic transitions. This effect can be understood by considering stimulated emission processes leading to fast relaxation towards deeply bound molecular levels."}
{"text":"We study lattice chiral gauge theories with Wilson fermions in four dimensions, focusing on their phase structure at finite temperature T . We show that there is no spontaneous breaking of parity (P) or time-reversal symmetry (T ) for any value of the bare quark mass m0 if the number Nf of flavors satisfies Nf > 2. This result implies that the theory does not have an order parameter associated to P and\/or T , which are spontaneously broken by the standard model. In particular, we find that the spectrum contains two degenerate Dirac fermion species corresponding to left-handed and right-handed quarks, respectively. These fermions can be identified as mirror fermions because they transform into each other under reflection about one spatial axis. The existence of these mirror fermions leads to interesting consequences such as the absence of flavor changing neutral currents mediated by gluons. \n \n Introduction \n \n Chiral gauge theories play important roles both theoretically and phenomenologically. They provide a natural framework for describing low-energy phenomena involving hadrons [1] .

{"text":"We present the results of 2D hydrodynamic simulations of supernova explosions inside wind bubbles blown by massive stars with different initial masses and metallicities. We find that for all considered cases, the shock wave is decelerated at distances between 0.1 pc to 1 pc due to interaction with dense shells formed during previous stellar winds. The density structure of these shells depends on metallicity and mass loss rate of the progenitor star. For low-mass progenitors (M < 20 Msun), we observe formation of thin shell which leads to efficient cooling behind it. In this case, the explosion energy is efficiently thermalized into hot plasma confined within the bubble interior. On the other hand, for high-mass progenitors (20 Msun < M < 40 Msun) we see formation of thick shell which does not cool down significantly after the passage of the blast wave. This leads to higher temperatures in the shocked gas and more energetic X-ray emission. \n \n Keywords: Supernova remnants"}

We measure the two-point correlation function for this sample using both direct counts-in-cells methods as well as Fourier space techniques. Our main result is that we find no evidence for any significant change in the amplitude or slope of the correlation function over this large redshift interval. This suggests that there has been little evolution in the typical mass scale of dark matter halos hosting these galaxies since z=5. In addition to measuring the overall shape of the correlation function, we also examine how it depends upon various physical properties such as luminosity, color, and spectral type."}

As a result, understanding these transformations has become increasingly important for applications ranging from energy storage [10] to catalysis [11] .\n \nIn many cases, however, predicting the outcome of a transformation requires knowledge about its underlying free energies [12] . This information cannot always be obtained directly via experimentation due to kinetic barriers [13] , making computational techniques [14] particularly useful [15] . Unfortunately, most current theoretical models [16] require extensive parameterization [17] and\/or detailed experimental characterization [18] before they can be applied effectively [19] .

The governing equations for this problem are derived in terms of the total pressure perturbation inside the loop as well as its cross-sectional area variation along the loop length. It is shown that these two variables can be expressed in terms of each other through a nonlinear differential equation which describes the evolution of the loop system. This equation has been solved numerically under different initial conditions corresponding to various physical situations. In particular, it is found that the loop may either expand or contract depending on whether the initial value of the total pressure perturbation is positive or negative respectively. Furthermore, the results show that there exists only one stable equilibrium state at any given time if the initial values of both the total pressure perturbation and the cross-sectional area variation satisfy certain constraints.

The calculated band gap agrees well with experiments on single crystals. In addition, we predict that there are two competing nematic phases near the metal-insulator boundary. One has in-plane anisotropy along the Ru-O-Ru bond direction while another one has out-of-plane anisotropy perpendicular to it.

The former can be explained by Comptonization of soft photons emitted from the accretion disk around SMBHs, whereas the latter may originate from photoionized plasma surrounding the central engine or from relativistic jets. In addition, we found evidence for absorption features due to ionized iron K-shell transitions near 6.4-6.9 keV. These results suggest that this object harbors both a standard thin accretion disk as well as a hot corona."}

{"text":"The effect of an external magnetic field on the structure and dynamics of vortices in type-II superconductors is studied by numerical simulations based on the Ginzburg-Landau model with periodic boundary conditions. The results show that, for certain values of the applied current density Jc , there are two different types of vortex structures which can be observed depending on the magnitude of the external magnetic field H . For small fields (H < 0.5Jc ), we observe a triangular vortex lattice similar to Abrikosov's solution. However, when increasing the field strength further (0.5Jc < H < 1.2Jc ) this regular pattern becomes unstable and transforms into a disordered state consisting of randomly distributed dislocations. Finally, at higher fields (1.2Jc < H ) , the system undergoes another phase transition where it forms a square vortex lattice. This behavior is explained by considering the stability properties of the vortex solutions as well as their interaction energies."}
{"text":"We study the computational complexity of games with imperfect information, where players have no knowledge about each other's moves and actions are not necessarily alternating between them. We show that such games can be solved in polynomial time if they satisfy certain conditions on their structure (e.g., being bipartite). In particular, we prove this for all perfect-information games played by two or more players who do not know which player has made what move at any given point during play. Our results also apply to multiplayer versions of some well-known combinatorial problems like the traveling salesman problem. Games with imperfect information arise naturally when modeling situations involving multiple agents whose decisions cannot always be observed directly. For example, consider a group of people playing a board game together; it is often impossible to tell exactly who moved last because there may be several pieces involved in one move. Another common situation occurs in distributed systems, where different processes communicate indirectly via messages sent over an unreliable network."}

Their high mass makes them ideal targets to investigate how such large scale structures form and evolve over time."}
{"text":"We present the results on galaxy population in the most massive supercluster, SCl 126 (Abell 1689), based on spectroscopic data obtained with VLT\/VIMOS and Keck\/DEIMOS telescopes. We find that galaxies are distributed along filaments which connect clusters at different redshifts. The fraction of blue galaxies increases towards lower redshift, while the fraction of early-type galaxies decreases. This trend is more pronounced for bright galaxies than faint ones. In addition to this general picture we also detect some interesting features such as an excess of late-type galaxies around Abell 1689A cluster or a lack of bright galaxies between Abell 1689B and C clusters. These findings suggest that there may be significant differences among galaxy properties within individual clusters depending on their location relative to other structures. Our analysis shows that the observed trends can not be explained by simple passive evolution of stellar populations but require additional mechanisms like mergers and\/or interactions."}
{"text":"The purpose of this study is to examine the role that evaluation plays in communication between teachers and students during computer-based learning environments (CBLE). The research question guiding this investigation is: How does evaluation affect student-teacher interaction? This study was conducted with two groups of undergraduate students enrolled in an introductory course on educational technology at a large Midwestern university. Students were asked to complete three tasks using a CBLE called WebQuests, which are designed for use by students working individually or collaboratively. Data collection included audio recordings of group discussions, field notes taken by researchers observing each group's work, and students' written responses to questions posed throughout their participation in the project. Analysis revealed that evaluation played several roles within these interactions including providing feedback about individual performance; clarifying expectations; establishing ground rules; and promoting reflection. These findings suggest that evaluation can be used effectively to enhance student-teacher communication when it occurs frequently enough over time so that both parties have multiple opportunities to respond to one another."}
{"text":"In this work, we propose an adaptive service provisioning scheme to provide quality-of-service (QoS) guarantees and maximize the network utility by jointly optimizing resource allocation at both base stations (BSs) and mobile users (MUs). The proposed scheme is based on a communication model that incorporates user mobility into the QoS requirements. We formulate the problem as a joint optimization over BSs' power control variables, MUs' transmission rates, and their association with BSs. To solve it efficiently, we first decompose the original problem into two subproblems: one for each BS and another for all MUs. Then, we develop distributed algorithms to obtain solutions to these problems iteratively using dual decomposition techniques. Finally, simulation results show that our proposed algorithm can achieve better performance than existing schemes under various system settings. In recent years, wireless networks have been widely deployed around the world due to their low cost and easy deployment [1] . However, they are vulnerable to security attacks such as eavesdropping [2] , jamming [3] , and data tampering [4] .\nTo enhance the security level of wireless communications, physical layer security has attracted much attention recently [5] - [8] . Physical layer security exploits the characteristics of the wireless channel to ensure secure transmissions without relying on any additional cryptographic keys or protocols [9] . It was shown in [10] that if the legitimate transmitter-receiver pair shares no common information about the statistical properties of the channels between them and other potential eavesdroppers, then perfect secrecy cannot be achieved even when there exists infinite number of antennas at the transmitter side. Therefore, practical approaches should consider imperfections in the estimation process [11] , limited transmit power [12] , and finite antenna numbers [13] ."}
{"text":"We update the analysis of Ref.  by including recent measurements and theoretical developments, with particular emphasis on the impact of lattice QCD results for form factors at large recoil momentum transfer. We find that the current experimental data are consistent with Standard Model predictions within uncertainties. The most stringent bounds on possible contributions to these processes from beyond-the-Standard-Model particles can be obtained using the measured branching fractions together with the corresponding decay amplitudes predicted by specific models. In this work we consider several scenarios motivated by supersymmetric extensions of the Standard Model as well as generic effective field theories containing additional heavy degrees of freedom. \nI. INTRODUCTORY REMARkS\nThe study of rare charm meson decays is an important tool to search for new phenomena beyond the Standard Model (SM). These processes occur through loop diagrams involving virtual W bosons or top quarks; hence they provide sensitive probes of new heavy states which may exist near the TeV scale [1] . Moreover, since the SM contribution to such processes is suppressed due to helicity conservation, any observed deviations could potentially signal the presence of new interactions [2] .\nIn this Letter we present updated limits on new physics effects in two classes of rare charm decays: D 0 \u2192 K * \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 , where K * denotes either a vector or tensor resonance [3] ; and D 0 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u2113 + \u2113 \u2212 [4] . For both cases we use the latest available experimental information [5] - [8] along with state-of-the-art calculations of hadronic matrix elements [9] - [11] . Our main focus will be on the implications of recent lattice QCD computations [12] - [14] for the case of D 0 \u2192 K * \u2113 + \u2113\u2212 ."}

Laurent (see [3] ). In fact they do not even contradict the weaker statement made by J.-P. Serre [4] , which is equivalent to the Jacobian conjecture for curves over finite fields. Finally we give an example showing how one can construct counterexamples to the generalized Jacobi conjecture using our method. Let k be any field with char(k) = p > 0. For every integer n \u2265 1 let Xn denote the smooth projective curve defined over k by y n + a1yn\u22121 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + anny0 = xn+1,\nwhere ai \u2208 k * . It was shown by A. N. Parshin [5] that if char(k) = 2 then there exists a positive integer m such that the jacobian variety JacXm has complex multiplication. This implies that the jacobian varieties JacXn have complex multiplication for all integers n \u2261 \u00b11 mod m. If char(k) = 3 it follows from [6] that JacX3 does not have complex multiplication. However, it still remains open whether or not JacX4 has complex multiplication."}

The orbit has been determined using astrometric observations made with the US Naval Observatory's 1-meter telescope in Flagstaff Arizona between October 2005 and March 2007.   These data show that this object will not impact Earth during the next 100 years but may be a good candidate for future space mission targets. This work was supported by NASA under grant NNX07AG70G issued through the Planetary Defense Coordination Office.

{"text":"In this work, we propose an efficient multimedia content distribution scheme for hybrid wireless networks (HWNs). The proposed scheme is based on weighted clustering and can be used to distribute the same or different types of contents simultaneously over HWNs with multiple base stations (BSs) and mobile users (MUs), where each BS has limited storage capacity. In order to maximize the total number of MUs that receive their requested contents within their deadlines, our objective is to minimize the maximum delay among all MUs by optimizing the cluster sizes at each BS. We formulate the problem as a mixed integer linear programming model and solve it through Lagrangian relaxation-based heuristics. Extensive simulation results show that compared with existing schemes, the proposed one achieves better performance in terms of average user satisfaction ratio and average transmission time per MU.

{"text":"We propose an algorithm to select the injection point in hybrid networks, which is based on local information and can be implemented with low overheads. The proposed algorithm has two phases. First, it elects one node as the injection point by using only local information. Second, if there are multiple nodes that have been elected as the injection points, then these nodes will negotiate among themselves to determine exactly one injection point. We prove that our algorithm always selects at least one node as the injection points when all nodes are reachable from each other. Furthermore, we show through simulations that our algorithm performs well even under various network conditions such as dynamic topologies or limited communication ranges.

{"text":"We present the results of an optical spectroscopic survey aimed at finding tidal dwarf galaxies (TDGs) candidates among a sample of ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRG). We have obtained spectra with FORS2@VLT and GMOS-N@Gemini telescopes, covering the wavelength range between 3600 \u00c5 and 9200 \u00c5 , for a total of 16 ULIRGs selected on the basis of their high far-infrared luminosity (L FIR > 10 12 L \u2299 ) and low redshift (z < 0.1).\nThe main goal is to find TDGs that are expected to be found around interacting systems such as ULIRGs. The presence of young stars in these objects would make them detectable through strong emission lines like H\u03b1 or [OII] . However, we do not detect any significant excess of emission line flux over what can be explained by star formation occurring within the host galaxy itself. This result suggests either that there are no TDGs associated with our sample of ULIRGs or that they are too faint and\/or too red to be detected using current facilities."}
{"text":"We present an overview of recent theoretical progress in understanding B decays to light vector mesons, including both $\\rho$ and $\\pi^0$ states.  We discuss how these processes can be used as probes for new physics effects at low energies (e.g., via flavor-changing neutral currents) or high scales (via virtual heavy particles).  In particular we focus on the possibility that some puzzling experimental results observed recently by BaBar may signal new physics contributions to the decay amplitudes. Finally, we briefly comment on other interesting topics related to this subject such as CP violation in B decays into two light vectors and rare radiative transitions between vector meson pairs. The study of semileptonic and nonleptonic weak interactions involving hadrons is one of the most important tools available to particle physicists today. These reactions are sensitive to many fundamental parameters of our theory, like quark masses, CKM matrix elements, and couplings of gauge bosons to quarks and leptons. They also provide crucial information about the structure of hadronic matter through their dependence on form factors describing the distribution of charge and current inside composite systems. Moreover, they play a key role in testing the consistency of the Standard Model (SM), since any deviation from SM predictions would indicate the presence of New Physics (NP)."}

For example, the neutral cluster H$_{2}$O is found to adsorb flatly onto the surface via hydrogen bonding between its oxygen atoms and carbon atoms at the edges of the graphite sheets; while the protonated cluster H$_{3}$O+$ is observed to form an angle of $70^{\\circ}$ with respect to the surface normal due to electrostatic attraction between the positively charged cluster core and negatively charged carbon atoms; finally, the doubly-charged cluster H$_{4}$ O++ is seen to lie almost parallel to the surface plane because it has two positive charges which are balanced by one negative charge located near each end of the cluster."}
{"text":"We present an analysis of the evolution of interstellar dust grains, based on their size distribution inferred by infrared observations with ISO (Infrared Space Observatory). We find that the grain growth is dominated by coagulation at all times since the formation of the Sun. The total mass density of dust increases by about one order of magnitude during this time span. This increase can be explained by accretion of gas-phase metals onto pre-existing grains or condensation of new material out of the gas phase. In addition to these processes we also consider fragmentation as well as shattering due to collisions between particles. Fragmentation dominates over coagulation for small grains but becomes less important when the grains grow larger than 0.1 micrometres. For large grains shattering leads to a decrease in number density which counteracts the effect of coagulation. Our results are consistent with previous studies using different methods. \n \n Keywords: Interstellar medium"}

This work also presents a novel technique for identifying relevant comments using text mining techniques applied over the textual content of PRs.

In order to evaluate these proposals, we conducted experiments with data collected from GitHub repositories related to two well-known open-source projects.

{"text":"We study the effects on the entropy and Hawking temperature of extremal black holes due to higher derivative terms in the action, namely those coming from supersymmetric (SUSY) or quadratic curvature invariants such as the Gauss-Bonnet term. We find that for both types of corrections there is an enhancement of the entropy at low temperatures which can be understood by studying the near-horizon geometry of these solutions. In addition we show how this behavior changes when one considers different values of the coupling constants associated with each type of correction. Finally, we discuss some possible implications of our results within string theory. The thermodynamics of black holes has been studied extensively over the past few years [1] . One of the most interesting aspects of this subject concerns the possibility of having quantum gravity corrections to their classical description [2] , especially since it was shown recently [3] that they could have important consequences even if they are small compared to other physical scales involved in the problem. For example, it has been suggested [4] that the inclusion of certain quantum gravitational corrections may lead to a resolution of the information paradox [5] .\nIn particular, it seems reasonable to expect that the entropy of a black hole should receive contributions not only from its horizon area but also from additional degrees of freedom located near the singularity [6] . This idea leads naturally to consider modifications of Einstein's equations involving higher order derivatives [7, 8] .

The observed line profiles can be reproduced well by relativistic disk reflection models including Compton scattering effects. These results suggest that there is an additional component to the X-ray continuum other than the standard thin accretion disks around supermassive black holes. In addition, we find that the iron abundance relative to solar value is higher than 1.5 times in three out of four objects. This suggests that the central engines of these obscured AGNs may have been buried under heavy dusty torii. Finally, we discuss possible origins of this new type of buried supermassive black holes based on our observational results."}

{"text":"We study the Laplacian spectrum of complex networks, focusing in particular on its relation to the dynamics of random walks on them. We show that for any network with n nodes there are at most 2n eigenvalues different from zero (counting multiplicities). This bound is tight up to a constant factor when applied to trees or complete graphs. For general graphs we prove an upper bound of O(n log n) on the number of distinct nonzero eigenvalues. In addition, we provide lower bounds showing that this estimate cannot be improved by more than a polylogarithmic factor. Finally, we present numerical evidence suggesting that real-world networks have only few distinct nonzero eigenvalues. These results suggest that the spectral properties of complex networks may not depend strongly on their degree distribution but rather on other structural features such as clustering coefficients. The analysis presented here can also be used to derive new bounds on mixing times of Markov chains defined over these networks."}

We prove that solutions exist globally in time and converge exponentially fast towards the corresponding solitary wave as t goes to infinity. \nThe main idea is to use an appropriate Lyapunov functional together with suitable energy estimates. The proof relies on refined asymptotic expansions near solitary waves developed by Martel & Merle [J. Math. Pures Appl.

{"text":"We report on the generation of an unprecedentedly broad spectrum (>10 THz) by using a novel type of fiber, which is based on a microstructured optical fiber with a suspended core surrounded by air holes filled with liquid. The suspended-core fiber supports two guided modes that are confined to different regions along its length. One mode propagates through the central region of the fiber where it experiences strong confinement due to the high index contrast between silica glass and air; this results in large effective nonlinearity. The other mode propagates outside the central region of the suspended core, where it sees only weak refractive-index guiding. This leads to low loss for both modes over a wide wavelength range. We demonstrate experimentally that these two modes can be coupled together efficiently via stimulated Raman scattering when pumped at 1.55 \u00b5m. As a result, we obtain a broadband continuum spanning more than 10 THz centered around 2.7 \u00b5m."}
{"text":"We present new optical\/NIR data for GRB 060206, which show that its X-ray to radio afterglow is well described by an achromatic break at tbreak = 1.3 days followed by a power-law decay with index -1.2 (F\u03bd \u221d t-1.2). The lack of any spectral evolution across this break suggests it was caused by energy injection into the blast wave. We find no evidence for dust extinction along our line-of-sight; however we cannot rule out significant reddening due to host galaxy dust. Our results are consistent with previous claims that achromatic breaks observed in many other bursts may be explained as being due to late-time energy injections rather than jet-break effects. \n \n Keywords: Gamma-ray burst, Afterglow emission, Energy injection, Jet break, Redshift measurement \n \n INTRODUCTION \n \n In recent years there has been growing interest in understanding how gamma ray bursts (GRBs) produce their broadband electromagnetic radiation. This effort has led to several successful models describing the prompt phase of GRB emission (see e.g., Piran 2005; Zhang 2007), but less progress on explaining the origin of the afterglow component. A key feature of most afterglows is the presence of a steepening or 'jet break' in the light curve around one day postburst (Rhoads 1999) . Such breaks have traditionally been interpreted as marking the time when the relativistic ejecta becomes optically thin to synchrotron self-absorption, causing the flux density to drop rapidly. However, some authors argue that such breaks can also arise if the ejecta undergoes continued energy input following the initial explosion (e.g., Kumar & Panaitescu 2000; Granot et al. 2001; Chevalier & Li 2000) , while others suggest that they could instead result from changes in the geometry of the emitting region (e.g., Racusin et al. 2008 ).

{"text":"We present the first measurement of single-transverse-spin asymmetries (SSA) for hadronic dijets produced at midrapidity in p+p collisions at sqrt(sNN) = 5.02 TeV using data collected by the CMS experiment during 2012 corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.3 fb-1 . The SSAs are extracted as functions of jet transverse momentum and rapidity, azimuthal angle between jets, and event centrality. We observe no significant dependence on any kinematic variable except that the magnitude of the asymmetry decreases with increasing jet rapidity. Our results are compared to theoretical predictions based on perturbative QCD calculations including higher-order corrections and parton distribution function uncertainties. \nThe measured values agree well within experimental and theoretical uncertainties. This is the most precise measurement of this observable performed so far. \n \n Introduction \n \n Single transverse-spin asymmetries have been observed in several processes involving polarized protons or neutrons [1] , such as inclusive pion production [2] , semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering [3] , Drell-Yan lepton pair production [4] , prompt photon production [5] , and direct photons [6] . These measurements provide important information about the spin structure of nucleons [7, 8] .\n \nIn particular, they can be used to test the validity of factorization theorems [9] which relate hard-scattering cross sections to partonic distributions inside the proton [10] . In addition, these observables may also shed light on new physics beyond the Standard Model [11] . \n \n For example, it has recently been suggested [12] that large single-spin asymmetries could arise due to the interference of two amplitudes describing different helicities of quarks emitted from longitudinally polarized gluons in high-energy pp collisions. Such effects would violate parity conservation and thus constitute evidence for new physics [13] . However, there exists only one previous measurement [14] of single-spin asymmeties in hadronic dijet production at high energies.

{"text":"We present new results on the chemical composition of interstellar matter (ISM) based on high-resolution spectroscopy of two bright Galactic planetary nebulae, NGC 6153 and IC 4593. We find that these objects are characterized by an overabundance of oxygen relative to iron compared with solar values. This is consistent with previous studies of other PNe but our data show for the first time that this effect persists even when we consider only those ions which are not affected by photoionization effects.  The observed O\/Fe ratio can be explained if most of the Fe atoms were locked up into dust grains prior to their destruction during the PN phase. In addition, we detect significant amounts of sulfur in both targets indicating that at least some fraction of S was also incorporated into dust grains before being released back into the gas phase after grain destruction. Finally, we argue that the presence of such large quantities of metals in the ISM may lead to systematic errors in determinations of elemental abundances using emission-line ratios measured in H II regions."}
{"text":"We report on kinetic-ion simulations addressing whether ion trapping inflates stimulated Brillouin backscattering (SBS) reflectivities in the presence of an electron beam and plasma waves. We find that, for typical parameters relevant to high-power laser-plasma experiments, SBS is dominated by electrostatic Langmuir wave instabilities rather than ion-acoustic modes. The latter are suppressed due to Landau damping as well as mode conversion into electromagnetic radiation at oblique angles with respect to the direction of propagation. In addition, we show that the effect of ion trapping can be neglected if the density fluctuations associated with the trapped ions are small compared to those caused by the electrons. Finally, we demonstrate that the inclusion of ion trapping does not significantly affect the growth rates or saturation levels of the dominant electrostatic Langmuir waves. This finding suggests that the observed discrepancies between theory predictions and experimental results may originate from other effects such as nonlocality and\/or nonlinear coupling among different types of waves."}

In particular, if cs = 1 then r = 16(nT)2\/5 and dns\/d ln k = \u22128(nT)1\/5, which may provide a possible explanation for recent observations of high value of nT reported by WMAP7 data combined with other CMB experiments."}
{"text":"We present an analytical model for the magneto-rotational instability (MRI) in protoplanetary disks, which is based on the assumption that the disk can be divided into two regions with different physical properties and dynamics. The inner region has a high density and temperature, while the outer one is less dense but hotter than the surrounding medium. We show how this simple picture allows us to reproduce many observed features of MRI-driven turbulence in accretion disks around young stars. In particular, we find that:  -The growth rate of the fastest growing mode decreases rapidly towards smaller radii due to the increasing gas pressure.  -The radial profile of the turbulent viscosity follows closely the profile of the magnetic field strength.  -The angular momentum transport efficiency increases strongly at small radii because of the rapid increase of the surface density there.  -The predicted mass accretion rates are consistent with those inferred observationally for T Tauri stars."}
{"text":"We present an analytical model that describes how quasars are triggered by galaxy mergers in elliptical galaxies (EEs). The merger rate is determined by the number density evolution of EEs as well as their merging timescale. We show that our model can reproduce observed quasar luminosity functions at different redshifts with reasonable parameters. In addition to triggering quasars, galaxy mergers also trigger starbursts which may be responsible for producing dusty obscured quasars. Our results suggest that most quasars reside in massive halos with masses greater than 10^12M_sun\/hour. This implies that quasars play important roles in regulating the growth of supermassive black holes and the formation of large-scale structures through energy feedback processes. Keywords: Quasars, Galaxy Evolution, Energy Feedback, Large-Scale Structure Formation. 1 Introduction   A large fraction of the baryons in the universe exist in the form of hot plasma known as intergalactic medium (IGM), but only about 5% of them have been detected so far. It has been suggested that this missing baryon component could be associated with dark matter halos via gravitational interactions (White et al., 1993; Fukugita et al., 1998; Cen & Ostriker 1999) . However, it remains unclear what physical mechanisms drive gas into these halos.  One possible mechanism is that cold streams penetrate deep inside dark matter halos and heat up due to shocks or other heating sources such as cosmic rays (Kere\u0161 et al., 2005; Dekel et al., 2009 ). Another possibility is that galactic winds driven by supernovae and\/or active galactic nuclei (AGNs) blow out some of the gas from the host galaxies (Springel & Hernquist 2003; Scannapieco et al., 2006) . These two scenarios predict very different properties of the accreted gas onto central supermassive black holes (SMBHs).  For example, if AGN-driven winds dominate over cold streams, then SMBHs should grow faster during early epochs when there were more powerful winds. On the contrary"}
{"text":"We study the supersymmetry breaking in type II string theory on Calabi-Yau threefolds with fluxes turned on. We show that there is an infinite number of solutions to the equations for the supersymmetry conditions which are related by duality transformations. The dualities relate different types of branes wrapping cycles inside the internal space. In particular we find new solutions where D-brane instantons wrap non-trivial 3-cycles. These solutions can be interpreted as arising due to gaugino condensation on wrapped D7-branes. We also discuss how these results fit into the context of mirror symmetry. Finally, we comment on possible generalizations to other compactification manifolds such as orbifold singularities or G 2 -manifolds. Superstring theories provide us with a unique opportunity to explore quantum gravity at energies well below the Planck scale. However, it has been known since the early days of string theory [1] , that perturbative calculations break down when one tries to describe phenomena like black holes or cosmological evolution near the big bang\/crunch. This problem was solved by Sen [2] who showed that nonperturbative effects could stabilize certain moduli fields (like the dilaton) even if they were not protected by any gauge symmetries. Since then many authors have studied this phenomenon using various techniques [3] . One particularly interesting approach involves turning on background fluxes [4] .\nIn recent years much progress has been made towards understanding the dynamics of supersymmetric vacua in string theory [5] . It turns out that the low-energy effective action describing the physics around a given vacuum takes the form of N = 1 supergravity coupled to matter multiplets [6] . For example, in the case of type IIB strings on a Calabi Yau manifold M CY , the low energy description is given by the following action: \nwhere F p+1 denotes the RR field strength associated with the p + 1-form potential C p+1 . Here K(M CY ) is the K\u00e4hler potential encoding information about the complex structure deformations of M CY while W (M CY ) is its holomorphic"}
{"text":"We present an analytical model to study the formation of red elliptical galaxies in hierarchical cosmologies. We assume that supermassive black holes (SMBHs) grow by accretion at high redshift z > 6 when gas is abundant but cooling times are short. The SMBH growth rate depends on its mass M\u2022(z), which we calculate using semi-analytical models based on merger trees extracted from N-body simulations. In our scenario, quasars shine brightly during their active phase with luminosities LQSO ~ 1045 erg s-1. They heat up surrounding cold gas clouds via photoionization heating and Compton scattering, preventing them from forming stars efficiently until they fade away after about 1 Gyr. This leads to a bimodal color distribution of early-type galaxies as observed today. Our results show good agreement with observations such as the quasar luminosity function, galaxy clustering statistics, and the fraction of red ellipticals among all massive galaxies."}
{"text":"We report on an experimental study of the spin-dependent properties of a two-dimensional electron system in GaAs\/AlGaAs quantum wells by means of polarized light scattering (PL) and magneto-optical spectroscopy (Raman). The PL experiments are performed at low temperatures, where we observe circularly polarized emission with opposite helicity for right- and left-circularly polarized excitation. We show that this effect is due to the presence of a strong exchange interaction which leads to a splitting of the excitonic states into two branches corresponding to different spins of the carriers. In addition, we find that the degree of circular polarization depends strongly on temperature and magnetic field strength. By comparing our results with those obtained by polarized Raman scattering under similar conditions, we demonstrate that both techniques provide complementary information about the electronic structure of the investigated samples. Our findings can be used as input parameters for theoretical models describing the transport phenomena in semiconductor nanostructures."}
{"text":"We report on the detection by Swift\/BAT and Konus-Wind of gamma-ray burst (GRB) 060927, which is one of only two events detected with redshifts greater than five to date.  The redshift was determined using optical spectroscopy obtained with the Very Large Telescope in Chile within three hours after the burst trigger time.  We find that this event has an extremely hard spectrum, similar to other high-redshift bursts observed previously.  Using our current understanding of the physics behind these phenomena we can estimate the total energy released during the prompt emission phase of the burst to be ~10^53 erg.  This value is comparable to or larger than the energies released by some supernovae.  If confirmed, it would make GRB 060927 the most energetic event ever recorded.  In addition, if the host galaxy mass function evolves similarly to what is seen locally, then the progenitor system responsible for producing such an energetic explosion must have been hosted by a very massive galaxy.  These results are consistent with theoretical predictions made about the progenitors of high-z GRBs.  Finally, we discuss how future observations of this object may help us understand the end of cosmic reionization."}
{"text":"The purpose of this article is to present an overview of some recent results in quantum field theory (QFT) on curved spaces with noncommutative coordinates. The main motivation for studying QFTs on such spaces comes from string theories which are formulated as open strings attached to D-branes whose positions can be described by noncommuting matrices. In particular we will focus our attention on the so-called Groenewold-Moyal plane which is defined as the space generated by two non-commuting coordinates satisfying the commutation relations [q\u03bc(x), q\u03bd(y)] = i\u03b8\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1q\u03c1(xy). We will show that it is possible to define a covariant derivative operator acting on fields living on the GroenewoldMoyal plane. This allows us to introduce a notion of spinor fields on the Groenewold- Moyal plane. Moreover we will discuss how one can construct gauge invariant actions for these fields. Finally we will study the action of the discrete symmetries C,P,T and CP T ."}

{"text":"We perform global three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations to study grain growth, dust settling, and planetesimal formation around protoplanets embedded within turbulent disks with dead zone boundaries. We find that grains grow by coagulation up to millimeter sizes at the snow line ($R_s = 2.7 \\ast d_{s} AU$), where $R_s$ is the distance between the central star and the snowline, $ds$ is the disk scale height, and $AU$ denotes astronomical unit. Grains are trapped inside the dead zone due to magnetic pressure gradient force and settle toward midplane. The maximum size of grains increases as they approach the planet's location because of higher gas density there. Dust particles can be captured into growing planetesimals when their Stokes number becomes smaller than unity. Our results show that planetesimals form efficiently only if the initial dust-to-gas mass ratio is larger than $10^{-3}$."}

The prompt emission lasted for about 1 s with an average photon energy E = 300 keV in the 15-350 keV band. We find that the temporal decay index is ~1.2 between 10s to 1000s post-burst time scale which indicates that this event belongs to the class of ultra-long GRBs. In addition we also detect a possible rebrightening feature around 100s post-burst time-scale. Our spectral analysis shows that the spectrum can be fitted well using both single power-law model as well as broken power law model.

{"text":"We present the results of our analysis of the effects of cosmic rays on galaxy clusters, using cosmological hydrodynamic simulations with and without CRs. We find that the presence of CRs leads to an increase in gas temperature at large radii (r > 0.5Rvir) due to adiabatic compression of the ICM during cluster formation. The effect is more pronounced for higher values of the initial magnetic field strength. In addition we find that there are significant differences between the radial profiles of X-ray surface brightness obtained with and without CRs which can be used as observational signatures of their presence. Finally, we show that the inclusion of CRs has little impact on the global properties such as total mass or luminosity but does affect the distribution of metals within the cluster.

{"text":"We present the first complete catalog of high-energy spectral parameters (photon index, low-energy cutoff) and durations observed by the Burst Alert Telescope on board NASA's Swift satellite. We find that there is no correlation between these quantities in either pre-Swift or Swift bursts. This result contradicts previous claims that such correlations are evidence for physical origins of the correlations. The lack of any significant correlation suggests that the underlying physics driving the emission process may be more complicated than previously thought. In particular, we show that it is possible to produce simulated data sets with similar statistical properties as those observed without requiring any additional assumptions about the nature of the emission mechanism beyond what has already been established observationally. These results have important implications for future theoretical work attempting to explain the origin of gamma-ray burst prompt emission. Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), intense flashes of gamma rays lasting only milliseconds, were discovered over thirty years ago but their exact cause remains unknown. One of the most puzzling aspects of this phenomenon is the apparent diversity among GRBs themselves; while some bursts exhibit smooth power-law spectra extending up to several hundred keV, others display complex features including multiple peaks and\/or breaks in their energy distributions. Despite this variety, however, many studies have found that all GRBs share certain common characteristics which can be summarized into two main empirical relations known as the Amati relation and Ghirlanda relation. \n \n Both of these relations relate the peak photon flux at high energies (>100 MeV) to other observable quantities such as the total fluence emitted during the burst and its duration. While both relations appear to hold true statistically when applied to large samples of bursts, they do not necessarily reflect an intrinsic connection between the various observables involved. Indeed, recent observational campaigns have shown that the scatter around each relation increases significantly if one attempts to apply them to individual bursts rather than entire populations. Furthermore, the fact that the same relations also seem to hold true for X-ray flares associated with some bursts indicates that they cannot simply be attributed to differences in viewing angle alone. Instead, these observations"}
{"text":"We study the possibility that electroweak symmetry breaking is triggered by strong dynamics at an ultraviolet (UV) fixed point, as suggested by gauge-Higgs unification models with warped extra dimensions. We show how this scenario can be realized within the framework of composite Higgs models based on strongly-coupled gauge theories. In particular we consider two different realizations of such scenarios: one where the Higgs arises as a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson associated to spontaneous breaking of approximate global symmetries; another where it emerges as a bound state of new fermions charged under the Standard Model gauge group. The latter case leads to novel signatures for Higgs production through gluon fusion which are potentially observable at future colliders. Finally, we discuss possible implications of these results for cosmology. Gauge-Higgs unification provides a compelling explanation for why the weak scale is so much smaller than any other mass scale in nature [1] . It also offers a natural solution to the hierarchy problem between the Planck and TeV scales [2] , since quantum corrections to the Higgs potential are cut off at the UV scale [3] .\nIn order to realize this idea in practice, however, several challenges must be overcome [4] : i) the Higgs should arise naturally out of some strongly coupled sector; ii) the Higgs couplings to SM particles should agree with experiment; iii) there should exist a mechanism to generate masses for all SM fields without introducing large hierarchies among them. These issues have been addressed recently using the Randall-Sundrum model [5] , where the Higgs field lives on the IR brane while gravity propagates into the bulk [6] - [8] . This setup allows for a calculable description of the Higgs physics [9] , but introduces additional complications due to the presence of Kaluza-Klein gravitons [10] ."}
{"text":"The isobaric analog state (IAS) in nuclei has been studied by using the folding model with microscopic nucleon-nucleon interactions based on chiral effective field theory. The IAS was found to be sensitive to both the isoscalar and isovector parts of the nuclear matter density distribution as well as the strength of the spin-orbit interaction. In particular, it was shown that the IAS can provide useful information about the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy at subsaturation densities. It was also demonstrated that the effect of the tensor force on the IAS depends strongly on the choice of the nuclear mean-field potentials used for describing the ground-state properties of nuclei.

{"text":"We introduce the notion of framed bicategory, which is an internalization of the concept of 2-category with duals in the context of enriched categories.  We show that any strict monoidal category gives rise to such a structure, and we prove that this construction has a left adjoint.  This allows us to define a model for the homotopy theory of (strict) monoidal categories as a simplicial set whose n-simplices are given by framed bicategories with n-objects.   Finally, we give some examples of how our results can be applied to study the homotopical properties of various classes of monoidal categories. The main result of this article is Theorem 4.3.1 below, which states that there exists a Quillen equivalence between the model category of small strict monoidal categories and the model category of small framed bicategories. In particular, it follows that the classifying space of the former is equivalent to the nerve of the latter."}
{"text":"We report on the polarization dependent photoluminescence (PL) and Raman scattering spectra of CdSe\/CdS core\/shell quantum dots in solution at room temperature. The PL spectrum shows that the emission is polarized along the direction perpendicular to the excitation light, which can be explained by the selection rules for dipole transitions between electronic states with different angular momenta. In addition we observe an anisotropic broadening of the Stokes linewidths as well as a splitting into two components when exciting circularly polarized light. These effects are attributed to the presence of exciton fine structure due to spin-orbit coupling. We also find evidence for a strong electron-phonon interaction leading to phonon sidebands in both the Stokes and anti-Stokes parts of the Raman spectrum. Finally, we show how these results can be used to determine the orientation of individual QDs embedded in a polymer matrix.

{"text":"Anhedonia is an important symptom of depression and schizophrenia, but its underlying neurobiological mechanisms are still poorly understood. In this study we investigated whether exposure to chronic social defeat (CSD) can induce anhedonic-like behavior in male C57BL\/6J mice.

Moreover, CSD-exposed mice showed increased immobility time during forced swimming test as well as reduced locomotor activity in open field test. Finally, we observed significant decrease in dopamine release in nucleus accumbens shell after acute administration of amphetamine in defeated mice. These results suggest that CSD may be used as animal model of anhedonia. Anhedonia is one of the most prominent symptoms of major depressive disorder (MDD), which affects about 20% of patients worldwide 1 . It refers to loss or reduction of pleasure experienced by individuals 2 , resulting in inability to experience joyful events 3 .\nIn addition to MDD, anhedonia has been also described in other psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia 4 , bipolar disorder 5 , obsessive-compulsive disorder 6 , eating disorders 7 , substance abuse 8 , and borderline personality disorder 9 .

Another one appears only when fitting the whole dataset simultaneously with all three models considered here -power law plus exponential cut-off, broken power law or Comptonization model-.

{"text":"The authors study the effect that random fluctuations in synaptic conductances have on neuronal firing.  They use an integrate-and-fire model neuron with fluctuating excitatory and inhibitory inputs, which are modeled as Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes (OU). The OU process is characterized by two parameters:  $\\mu$ - mean value of the process; $\\sigma$ - standard deviation of the process. In this work they vary these parameters to examine how they affect the spiking activity of the simulated neuron. \nThey find that when the input has low variance (low $\\sigma$), the neuron fires regularly at its intrinsic frequency.  When the input has high variance (high $\\sigma$) it causes irregular firing patterns.  This occurs because the membrane potential of the neuron can be driven above threshold for longer periods than normal causing bursts of action potentials.  These results agree well with experimental data obtained from recordings made from real neurons."}
{"text":"We study the statistical properties of surface fluctuations for different values of the lateral size L and height H of the system, using numerical simulations on square lattices with periodic boundary conditions.

The crossover between these two regimes occurs around \u03b8 = 0.5\u03c0. In addition to this behavior, we observe that the PDFs are strongly dependent upon both L and H. This dependence can be explained as finite-size effects: when L or H becomes smaller than some characteristic length scale, the PDFs become broader due to the presence of more rare events. Finally, we show how our results compare favorably with experimental data obtained from scanning tunneling microscopy measurements performed on Si(111). PACS numbers: 68.35.Bs"}

Learning to predict future values of a given time series requires understanding patterns hidden within it. However, due to high complexity of many real world problems, finding these patterns may require processing large amounts of data. In order to make accurate predictions we need to find a way to extract useful information from raw data while at the same time being able to deal with noise present in the signal. This problem becomes even more challenging if one wants to process data streams arriving continuously or having very short duration between consecutive samples."}

The X-ray spectrum can be described by either a power law model or thermal bremsstrahlung emission; both are consistent with previous studies. In addition we report the detection of pulsations in the radio band which have been previously reported only once before. These pulsations show up as periodic intensity variations in our data set, and their periodicity has been confirmed using two independent methods. Using these results together with those obtained from optical photometry and spectroscopy, we conclude that this source most likely contains a neutron star accreting matter from its companion Be-star via Roche lobe overflow."}
{"text":"We present new observations at 1.4 GHz and 8.5 GHz with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) of the radio afterglow associated to the gamma-ray burst GRB030329, which occurred on March 29th 2003. The data were taken between April 2nd and May 8th 2004, i.e., more than one year after the burst event. We find that the source is still brightening in flux density by about 0.5% per day at both frequencies. This behaviour can be explained if we assume that the fireball has not yet reached its final deceleration radius. In this case, the observed emission would come from an expanding shell of relativistically moving material surrounding the central engine. If so, our results suggest that the energy injection process responsible for the late-time flaring activity detected in other GRBs may have continued up to very large distances from the progenitor system. \n \n Keywords: Gamma-Ray Bursts"}

{"text":"We study the solidification process in a model system consisting of particles interacting via repulsive soft-core potentials and subject to an external driving force. We show that, for sufficiently large values of the driving amplitude, the system undergoes a phase transition into a state where it behaves as if it were made up by two coexisting phases with different densities. The low-density phase is characterized by a slow relaxation towards equilibrium which can be described within mean-field theory. In contrast, the high density phase relaxes rapidly toward its stationary configuration. \n \n This behavior resembles closely what happens during the freezing of colloidal suspensions driven out of equilibrium by an applied shear flow. Our results suggest that this analogy may not only hold at the level of static properties but also when considering dynamical features such as the response to perturbations or the presence of aging effects. Finally we discuss possible extensions of our work to more realistic models describing the glassy dynamics observed experimentally in supercooled liquids. \nI. INTRODUCTORY REMARK\nIn recent years there has been growing interest on the possibility of observing analogies between the physics of glasses and other disordered systems [1] . One of these analogies concerns the role played by fluctuations in determining the macroscopic behaviour [2] , another one relates to the existence of metastable states [3] .\nThe aim of this Letter is to investigate whether similarities exist also in terms of dynamic properties. To this end we consider a simple model of glass-forming liquid [4] whose microscopic degrees of freedom are represented by N point-like particles moving in d dimensions under the action of pairwise interactions.

{"text":"We present the results of an investigation into the properties and evolution of transients that arise when initial conditions are generated using Lagrangian perturbation theory (LPT) for cosmological N-body simulations. We find that LPT-based initial conditions produce spurious large-scale power at late times, which is not suppressed by increasing the number of particles used to generate these initial conditions. This effect can be mitigated by applying a low-pass filter to the evolved density field prior to generating new initial conditions with higher-order LPT. However, this approach does not completely remove all unwanted effects associated with the use of LPT-generated initial conditions. In addition, we show how the choice of time step used to evolve the initial conditions affects their accuracy.

{"text":"We study the effect on cluster abundance and Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) power spectrum due to primordial non-Gaussianity in the context of inflationary models with an additional scalar field, which is responsible for driving cosmic acceleration at late times. We find that the SZ power spectrum can be used as a probe of both primordial non-Gaussianity and dark energy properties such as equation-of-state parameter w0 and its time-derivative wa. In particular we show how these parameters affect the amplitude and shape of the SZ power spectrum. The results are presented using a simple analytical model based on perturbation theory upto second order. This work will help us understand better the nature of dark energy by combining it with other probes like supernovae Ia data or CMB anisotropy measurements. It also provides useful information about the physics of inflation through primordial non-Gaussianity. Introduction:-Inflation [1] , one of the most successful paradigms in modern cosmology, predicts a nearly scale-invariant Gaussian distribution of density fluctuations [2] . However recent observations [3] have shown some deviations from this prediction indicating possible presence of primordial non-Gaussianities [4] .\nIn addition to explaining the origin of large-scale structure formation [5] , inflation has been proposed [6] as a mechanism for generating the observed accelerated expansion of the universe [7, 8] . Inflationary scenarios predict that there should exist another light scalar field besides inflaton [9] , called quintessence [10] , which drives the current accelerating phase of the universe [11] . Quintessential inflation [12] is a class of inflationary models where the role played by the inflaton during inflation is taken over by quintessence after inflation ends [13] . These two fields interact minimally [14] leading to interesting consequences [15] . For example, if the potential of quintessence is sufficiently flat then it may lead to eternal inflation [16] . If so, then our observable patch of the universe would correspond only to a tiny fraction of all space-time [17] . Another possibility is that the quintessence field decays into radiation [18] thereby reheating the universe [19] ."}

{"text":"We have studied the low temperature (T < 1 K) electron spin relaxation rate, T1e-1\/T1e = 1\/(1 + T2e), for gold-palladium alloys with different compositions by using pulsed muon-spin rotation and relaxation measurements. The results show that the observed relaxation rates are consistent with those expected from Elliott-Yafet scattering mechanism at high temperatures but deviate significantly below 0.5 K. We find that this deviation can be explained if we assume an additional contribution to the relaxation rate due to spin-orbit interaction between conduction electrons and localized magnetic moments associated with Pd atoms. This is supported by our theoretical calculations based on density functional theory which predict a large enhancement of the spin-orbit coupling strength as one moves away from the center of the Brillouin zone towards the Fermi surface. Our findings suggest that the presence of localised magnetic moment may play an important role in determining the transport properties of these materials even though they do not order magnetically down to lowest measured temperatures."}

In order to overcome this problem we propose an alternative model which reproduces all relevant physical quantities within their experimental uncertainty. This new model can also be used to study other phenomena like capillary waves. \n \n Introduction \n \n Interfaces are ubiquitous in nature and play important roles in many processes ranging from phase separation [1] over wetting [2] to crystal growth [3] .

In contrast, we find that disorder leads to a monotonic increase of $\\rho$ with decreasing temperature. Our results are consistent with recent experiments on suspended samples. \n \n Introduction \n \n Graphene has attracted considerable attention since its experimental discovery [1] , mainly because it exhibits unique physical phenomena such as massless Dirac fermions [2] , Klein tunneling [3] , anomalous quantum Hall effect [4] , and high mobility [5] . These fascinating features have been extensively studied by various theoretical methods [6] - [8] . However, most previous works focused only on the low-temperature regime where phonon scattering dominates [9] - [11] . Recently, several groups [12] - [14] reported measurements of the electrical resistance of suspended graphene over wide ranges of temperature $T_{\\text{F}} = 5-300 K$ and carrier density $n$. They found that the resistivity $\\rho(n,T)$ shows non-monotonic behavior as a function of temperature, i.e., there exists a minimum value of $\\rho$ near $100 K$.

{"text":"We present an analysis of the alignments between galaxy spins and tidal fields in real space, using data from the Two Mass Redshfit Survey (TMRS). We find that galaxies are preferentially aligned perpendicular to their local tidal field on scales larger than 1 Mpc\/h. This alignment is stronger for more massive galaxies at higher redshifts. The observed spin-tide correlation can be explained by the effect of gravitational torques exerted by large-scale structures during the formation process of these galaxies. Our results suggest that this mechanism may play an important role in shaping galactic angular momenta. These findings have implications for understanding how dark matter halos acquire their angular momentum as well as for interpreting observations of cosmic shear statistics. Introduction: Galaxies form within overdense regions of the universe where they experience strong gravitational interactions with other objects such as neighboring galaxies or clusters of galaxies. During the formation process, these interactions induce gravitational torques which affect the orientation of the galactic angular momentum vector. In turn, the orientations of galactic angular momenta determine the shapes of galaxies through dynamical friction processes. Therefore, it has been suggested that the shape distribution of galaxies could provide information about the origin of galactic angular momentums (e.g., Catelan & Theuns 1996; Lee et al. 2008) . However, observational studies show conflicting results regarding whether there exists any preferred direction of galaxy spin axes relative to their neighbors' positions (see e.g., Faltenbacher et al. 2002; Bailin et al. 2005; Paz et al. 2008; Codis et al. 2012 , for recent works).\nIn order to understand the physical mechanisms responsible for determining the directions of galactic angular momentas, we need to study the statistical properties of galaxy spin distributions over large volumes of the universe. Recent surveys like Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) allow us to measure galaxy orientations accurately enough to perform such analyses. For example, Lee et al.

Our analysis reveals that the degree distribution of hubs follows a power-law [6] with exponent 2.5\u00b10.1 independently of the size and type of the considered network (see Fig.  1 ). Interestingly, our findings are also valid when considering only the largest component of each network [7, 8] . These results suggest that the observed scaling behavior is not due to finite-size effects but rather reflects some fundamental property of complex networks [9] ."}
{"text":"We study the regularity properties of functions in Sobolev spaces with respect to the free additive convolution product. We prove that if two functions belong to some Sobolev space then their free convolutions also do so (Theorem 1). This result is used for proving that the set of all functions belonging to some Sobolev spaces forms an algebra under the free convolution operation (Corollary 2).\nIn particular we show that the set of all infinitely differentiable functions on ${\\mathbb R}^d$ or ${\\mathbb Z}^d$ which are bounded together with all their derivatives belongs to this class of algebras (Proposition 3); it follows that these sets form Banach algebras as well. Finally, we give examples showing that our results cannot be extended to higher order Sobolev spaces. The main tool in our proofs is the Fourier transform. In fact, we use the following theorem proved recently by J. Bourgain, A. Brezis and G. Mironescu. \nLet us recall briefly what the free convolution means. Let $f\\in L^1({\\mathbb R}^d;\\mathbb C)$ and $g\\in L^1({\\mathbf{Z}}^d;\\mathbb C)\\cap L^2({\\mathbf{Z}^d})$.

{"text":"We present new observations of the molecular line emission in the vicinity of the massive young open cluster Westerlund 1 (Wd-1). The data were obtained with the Atacama Submillimeter Telescope Experiment (ASTE), which is an 8 m telescope located at Pampa la Bola, Chile. We detected strong 12CO and 13CO J = 3-2 lines toward Wd-1 using the ASTE 10 GHz band receiver system. In addition to these lines we also observed several other transitions including C18O 1-0, 2-1, and 3-2 as well as CS 7-6 and SO 2 25-26. These observations reveal that there are two distinct components of molecular gas associated with this object; one component has relatively low excitation temperature while another shows much higher temperatures. This latter component appears to be distributed along an arc-like structure around the central star cluster. Our results suggest that the hotter component may have been heated by shocks produced during the expansion of the stellar winds and\/or supernovae explosions within the open cluster."}

The system is composed of a neutron star orbiting around its companion with P orb ~ 3 days. We have performed optical spectroscopy on this object using VLT\/FORS2 instrument which shows that it has strong emission lines typical for accreting binaries. From these observations we conclude that the system hosts a white dwarf primary component and a magnetic neutron star. This makes IGR J00234+61 one more example of intermediate polar class of objects. In addition to the main spectral features there are also some absorption lines present in our spectrum. These could be due either to the secondary star or to interstellar medium along the line-of-sight towards the source."}
{"text":"We study the nonlinear dynamics of infectious diseases transfer in a population, where individuals are divided into three classes: susceptible (S), infected (I) and recovered\/removed (R). We consider two different models: SIR model and SEIR model. In both cases we assume that there is no birth or death in the population. The main goal of this work is to investigate how the disease spreads through the population depending on its parameters. For example, if the infection rate is too high then it may lead to an epidemic outbreak. On the other hand, if the recovery rate is very large compared to the infection rate then the number of infectives will decrease rapidly. Finally, we show some numerical simulations which illustrate our results. \n \n Keywords: Nonlinear dynamics, infectious diseases, tuberculosis, SIR model, SEIR model. 1 Introduction \n \n Many mathematical models have been developed over time to describe the spread of infectious diseases within populations [1\u20133] . These models can be used as tools to understand the transmission mechanisms of these diseases and help public health authorities make decisions about prevention strategies [4] .\n \nIn particular, many researchers have studied the effects of vaccination programs [5\u20137] , quarantine [8, 9] and isolation [10, 11] on the evolution of epidemics. Other studies focus on the impact of environmental factors such as temperature [12, 13] , humidity [14, 15] and rainfall [16] on the propagation of pathogens. \nThe majority of existing works use deterministic models based on ordinary differential equations [17] . However, stochastic models [18, 19] and agent-based models [20, 21] also exist. Agent-based models allow us to take into account individual behaviors [22] while stochastic models provide more realistic descriptions of random events [23] . \n \nIn this article, we propose new mathematical models describing the spread of infectious diseases in a closed population. Our aim is to analyze the influence of various parameters on the behavior of the system. More specifically, we want to determine whether the disease will die out naturally or cause an epidemic outbreak. To do so, we first introduce the basic reproduction number R0 [24] , which represents the average number"}
{"text":"We consider the possibility that our universe underwent two stages of accelerated expansion, first hybrid inflation and then modular inflation.  We show how this scenario can be realized in string theory with an explicit example based on type IIB orientifolds compactified to four dimensions on Calabi-Yau threefolds. In particular we find that there are many possible realizations of such models which lead to realistic values for the cosmological parameters. The model is consistent with all current experimental constraints including those coming from measurements of the cosmic microwave background anisotropies as well as from direct searches at colliders. Finally we discuss some phenomenological aspects of these scenarios. Introduction: Inflationary theories provide one of the most compelling explanations for several puzzles associated with the standard hot big bang cosmology [1] . They predict that primordial quantum fluctuations generated during inflation should have left their imprint on the temperature anisotropies observed today in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) [2] .\nIn recent years it has been shown that supersymmetric grand unified theories (GUTs), like SO(10) , naturally give rise to inflationary potentials [3] , while also providing a successful unification scheme [4] . However, GUT scale inflation suffers from the so-called \u03b7-problem [5] : the predicted value of the tensor-to-scalar ratio r = 16\u01eb H \/\u03b7 2 [6] leads to too large CMB quadrupole anisotropies [7, 8] unless \u01eb H \u226a 1 [9] or \u03b7 \u226b 10 \u22129 [10] . This problem may be alleviated if the inflaton potential contains flat directions [11] . These arise quite generically in supergravity [12] and string theory [13] due to non-perturbative effects [14] . A particularly interesting class of flat directions arises when the gauge group is broken down to its maximal subgroup [15] . Such flat directions were studied extensively in [16] where they were called \"moduli\" fields since they parametrize the size and shape of extra dimensions [17] . Moduli fields play an important role in string theory [18] because they determine the vacuum expectation values of various moduli fields appearing in the low energy effective action [19]"}
{"text":"The future neutrino factory experiments will be able to search for new physics beyond the Standard Model (SM) with unprecedented precision, and are expected to provide important information on the origin of matter-antimatter asymmetry as well as dark matter candidates.  In this talk I will present an overview of our recent studies on how to probe various types of new physics using these facilities. The results presented here were obtained by combining the analyses performed at the T2K experiment and its off-axis near detector ND280. These include searches for sterile neutrinos, lepton flavor violating processes such as neutrinoless double beta decay, CP violation effects in leptonic sector, and exotic Higgs bosons that can couple to both quarks and leptons. We also discuss possible improvements in sensitivity which may be achieved if we combine the data taken at T2K and NOvA experiments. Finally, prospects for probing new physics at future accelerator-based neutrino factories are discussed."}
{"text":"We study the representations of tame quivers with relations, which are finite-dimensional algebras over an algebraically closed field k. We define the notion of ``affine canonical basis'' for such algebras in terms of their indecomposable modules. This is done by generalizing the results on the representation theory of preprojective algebras obtained by Crawley-Boevey and Holland to arbitrary tame quiver algebras. In particular we show that any indecomposable module has a unique maximal submodule (up to isomorphism); this allows us to give a combinatorial description of the indecomposables as well as of the Auslander-Reiten translation. The main result of our work is then the construction of an explicit bijection between the set of indecomposable modules and the elements of the affine canonical basis. As applications we obtain new proofs of several known results about the representation theory of preinjective algebras and of Nakayama algebras."}
{"text":"We report on the experimental demonstration of an all-optical method for reconstructing molecular vibrational wavefunctions by means of nonlinear optical spectroscopy and quantum state tomography (QST). The technique is based on the measurement of the third-order polarization induced in a sample of gas-phase acetylene molecules by two pump pulses, followed by a probe pulse at variable time delay. By scanning this delay we obtain a series of signals that are used to determine the density matrix elements associated with each vibrational level populated during the interaction between the three pulses. We show how these measurements can be combined into a single QST experiment which allows us to retrieve information about both the population distribution among different levels as well as their relative phases. This approach provides direct access to the full vibrational wavefunction without any need for prior knowledge or assumptions regarding its form. \n \n In particular, it enables one to measure directly the phase difference between adjacent energy eigenstates, which has been shown to play a crucial role in determining many important physical properties such as chemical reactivity and transport coefficients."}
{"text":"We develop an agent-based model to study the evolution of social complexity in human societies, focusing on how heterogeneity among agents can lead to increasing returns that drive economic growth and technological innovation. We find that heterogeneous populations are more likely than homogeneous ones to evolve complex economies with specialized production units, markets for goods and services, and division of labor between producers. The presence of these features leads to higher levels of productivity and population density, which further increase the benefits associated with specialization and trade. Our results suggest that the emergence of such socioeconomic structures may have been one important factor driving the evolution of human society over the past few million years. In this work we present a computational model aimed at studying the evolutionary dynamics underlying the development of socio-economic systems. More specifically, our goal is to understand what factors might be responsible for the appearance of increasingly complex forms of organization observed across many different cultures throughout history. To address this question, we focus on the role played by two key ingredients commonly found in real-world systems: (i) diversity within the population; and (ii) positive feedbacks leading to increasing returns."}

{"text":"We prove that for any surface S of general type, the action of its absolute Galois group G(S) on the set of connected components of the modulis space M_g(S) is faithful.  This result has been conjectured by Grothendieck and proved in many cases (e.g., when g = 0 or 1).  We use this to show that if S admits an automorphism of order p > 2 then it also admits one of order q prime to p; we give examples where both orders are arbitrarily large. The proof relies on results about the existence of certain families of curves on S which have been obtained recently using techniques from algebraic geometry and number theory. In particular, we make essential use of the fact that the canonical map of such a curve C onto P^1 is birational; this implies that the image of C under the Albanese map Alb_S : S -> Alb_S(S) is not contained in a fiber of Alb_S."}

We show that if an IFS satisfies certain conditions then it can be encoded into a unitary representation of its associated wavelet group. This result is applied to prove that every self-similar fractal set with finite local complexity has a unique invariant measure up to scaling factors. The proof relies on the fact that any such fractal set can be approximated by a sequence of compact sets whose boundaries have zero Lebesgue measures. In particular, we obtain a new characterization of self-affine carpets as those fractals satisfying this condition. Finally, we give examples showing how our results apply to some well-known fractals including Sierpinski gasket, Koch snowflake, von Koch curve, and Menger sponge."}
{"text":"The effect of three different sugars (trehalose, maltase and sucrose) on the structure and dynamics of lysozyme has been investigated by molecular dynamics simulation at 300 K for 100 ns in each case. The results show that all these sugar molecules can stabilize the protein against thermal denaturation to certain extent but trehalose is found to be most effective one among them. Trehalose molecule forms hydrogen bonds with both polar and nonpolar amino acid residues which leads to increase in number of water molecules around it. This increases the hydration shell thickness as well as total solvent accessible surface area of the protein. It also decreases the root mean square deviation between initial and final structures indicating its ability to maintain the native conformation of the protein. Maltose and sucrose are less efficient than trehalose because they form only few hydrogen bonds with the protein. In addition, their presence causes slight decrease in the radius of gyration and end-to-end distance of the protein."}
{"text":"We study fluctuations of finite-time Lyapunov exponent (FTLE) for chaotic orbits on the standard map with periodic boundary conditions. We show that FTLE fluctuates around its mean value, which is determined by the largest unstable periodic orbit embedded into the chaotic attractor. The amplitude of these fluctuations decreases exponentially as time increases. In addition to this exponential decay we observe an algebraic tail at large times. This algebraic tail can be explained by the presence of small islands inside the chaotic sea. These results are confirmed numerically using different methods. \nI. INTRODUCTORY REMARK\nThe concept of finite-time Lyapunovexponent(FTLE), introduced by Wolf et al [1] , has been widely used recently [2] - [4] . It describes how fast nearby trajectories diverge or converge during some fixed period of time T . For example, if one considers two neighboring points x 0 = x(t 0 ) and y 0 = x(t 1 ), where t 0 < t 1 , then their separation after time T will be given by: \nwhere \u03bb max > 0 is the maximum Lyapunov exponent characterizing the rate of divergence between nearby trajectories [5] .\nIn order to calculate the FTLE it is necessary to solve the following variational equation:\nwhere J is the Jacobian matrix corresponding to the flow generated by Eq. (1). If the initial condition z 0 = x t0 + \u03b5y t0 is close enough to the reference trajectory x t0 , i.e., |\u03b5| \u226a 1, then the solution of Eq.(2) can be written as:\nwhere P n (T ; t 0 , t 1 ) is the nth-order Taylor polynomial expansion of the evolution operator U (T ; t 0 ).

{"text":"We study the dynamics of an overdamped Brownian particle in a periodic potential with time-delayed feedback control, where the delay is introduced by a finite response time of the controller. We show that this system can be described as a flashing ratchet and derive analytical expressions for its current-voltage characteristics. The results are compared to numerical simulations. \nI. INTRODUCTIO N\nThe motion of particles driven out of equilibrium has been studied extensively over recent years [1] . In particular, it was shown that under certain conditions such systems may exhibit directed transport even without any net bias [2] , which is known as stochastic resonance [3] or coherence resonance [4] .\nIn many cases, however, these effects occur only if the noise level exceeds some threshold value [5] . This problem can be overcome using delayed feedback control [6] , i.e., controlling the system not instantaneously but after a fixed amount of time t d . It turns out that this method allows one to obtain directed transport at arbitrarily small noise levels [7, 8] . Moreover, it also works when the external driving force vanishes [9] . However, all previous studies were restricted to unidirectional potentials (i.e., potentials with reflection symmetry). Here we consider a more general case of a bidirectional potential [10] , which exhibits two local minima separated by a barrier."}

It was found that these values are not consistent among themselves; however, they agree well within experimental error when the temperature dependence of the equilibrium constant is taken into account. This suggests that the discrepancy may be due to differences in the conditions under which each experiment was performed.

{"text":"We present scaling laws that govern the performance and design trade-offs in all-optical soliton pulse compressors based on cascading quadratic nonlinearities, such as self-phase modulation (SPM) followed by cross-phase modulation (XPM). We show how these devices can be designed to operate at high repetition rates with low loss while maintaining their ability to produce compressed pulses. The results are derived analytically using perturbation theory and confirmed numerically through simulations. Our analysis shows that the maximum achievable peak power is limited primarily by SPM-induced spectral broadening; however, this limit may be overcome if XPM is used to compensate for the increased bandwidth associated with higher-order dispersion effects. In addition, we find that the minimum required length scales inversely proportional to the square root of the input pulse energy. Finally, our results indicate that the optimal operating conditions depend strongly on the desired output parameters. \n \n \u00a9 2009 Optical Society"}
{"text":"We report on observations made with the Spitzer Space Telescope and Hubble Space Telescope (HST) that reveal aromatic infrared bands in the ionized gas surrounding the brightest star in the Horsehead Nebula, NGC 2264. The observed PAH features are consistent with those seen toward other H II regions excited by hot stars. We find no evidence for an enhanced abundance or unusual excitation conditions of these molecules compared to Galactic H II regions. This suggests that the physical processes responsible for the formation of PAHs may be similar in both environments. These results provide new insights into how PAHs form under extreme radiation fields. \n \n Keywords: Infrared, PAH, Horsehead Nebula, Starburst galaxies \n \n The Horsehead Nebula is one of several spectacular bipolar reflection nebulae associated with young open clusters in Orion's molecular cloud complex. It contains a central O-type star surrounded by a compact cluster of B- and A-type stars embedded within a dense shell of dusty material. Previous studies have shown that this region harbors large amounts of warm dust and cold molecular gas, as well as numerous Herbig-Haro objects indicative of ongoing mass ejection events. However, little has been known about its chemical composition until now because it lies behind thick clouds of interstellar extinction at optical wavelengths. Here we present mid-infrared spectroscopic data obtained using the Infrared Spectrograph aboard the Spitzer Space Telescope which show strong absorption features due to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). These features arise from vibrational modes of carbonaceous materials containing 50-200 atoms arranged in planar rings and chains. They are commonly found in photodissociation regions (PDRs), where ultraviolet photons emitted by nearby massive stars break apart hydrogen molecules, creating a layer of partially ionized gas between the illuminated surface of the molecular cloud and the neutral interior. Our analysis shows that the PAH features detected here are remarkably similar to those seen towards Galactic H II regions such as M17 SWex, suggesting that they originate from the same type of photoionization process."}
{"text":"Gravastars are hypothetical objects that may be the final state of stellar evolution, and which have been proposed as alternatives to black holes.  Gravastars can be distinguished from black holes by their gravitational lensing effects on background stars.   In this work we show how these differences in lensing behavior could be used to distinguish between gravastars and black holes using observations made with current or future space-based telescopes such as LSST (Large Synoptic Survey Telescope) and WFIRST-AFTA (Wide Field Infrared Space Telescope - Astro-Physics). Gravitational lenses are powerful tools for studying distant galaxies because they magnify images of background sources.  The most famous example is the Einstein ring produced when light passes close to the Sun's mass.  However, there are many other types of gravitational lenses including those formed by galaxy clusters, individual galaxies, and even dark matter halos around single galaxies.  Gravitational lenses also provide information about the masses of both foreground and background objects.  For instance, if one knows the distance to an object producing a gravitational lens effect then its mass can be determined directly from the observed angular diameter of the lensed image.  This technique has been used successfully to measure the masses of supermassive black holes at the centers of nearby galaxies.  Gravitational lensing occurs whenever light travels through regions where gravity varies spatially.  Thus it should occur wherever gravity deviates significantly from Newtonian predictions.  Black holes violate general relativity near their event horizons so they produce strong deviations from Newtonian gravity.  On the other hand, gravastars do not violate general relativity outside their surfaces..."}

INTRODUCTORY REMARK\nIn recent years there has been considerable interest in studying the phenomenon of phase transitions occurring in many-body systems [1] . This problem attracted attention mainly due to its relevance in various fields such as statistical mechanics [2] , condensed matter physics [3] , biology [4] , chemistry [5] , geophysics [6] etc..

For example, if the considered system undergoes a first-order phase transition then the discontinuity observed in the value of the order parameter does not necessarily imply the existence of a well-defined interface separating the coexisting phases [10] . Indeed, in this case the presence of a large amount of metastable states makes the identification of the actual equilibrium configuration extremely difficult [11] .

{"text":"We study the dynamics of a model system that undergoes both a jamming and rigidity transition, by means of extensive numerical simulations. We find that the relaxation time scales as $\\tau \\sim t^{1\/z}$ with $z = 1.5$ in the vicinity of the jamming point, while it follows an exponential law at higher densities. The latter behavior is consistent with previous results for hard spheres near the rigidity threshold. In addition to this slowing down we observe a crossover between two different regimes of diffusion. At low density particles diffuse heterogeneously on top of a static background, whereas they move homogeneously above the jamming point. This crossover can be understood within a simple mean-field theory which predicts a power-law decay of the mobility correlation function. Finally, we show how our findings are related to recent experiments on vibrated grains. Granular materials exhibit fascinating phenomena such as avalanches or force chains [1] . These properties have been studied extensively over many years [2] , but only recently has attention shifted towards their dynamical response [3] .\nIn particular, there has been growing interest in understanding the collective motion of dense packings [4] . It was found that even though individual particles may not move much, the entire packing can still rearrange significantly [5] . Moreover, these systems often display anomalous transport [6] : Particles diffuse slowly compared to Brownian motion [7, 8] , and the diffusion constant depends strongly on the particle size [9] . Recent work suggests that these features arise due to the presence of soft modes [10] , i.e., low-energy excitations that do not cost energy [11] . However, despite considerable progress [12, 13] , the origin of these modes remains unclear [14] .\nThe most prominent example of a disordered material displaying slow dynamics is amorphous solids [15] .

To accomplish this task, the L AT uses a combination of silicon strip detectors and CsI(Tl) scintillators arranged in four layers around a central tungsten converter foil [3] , see Figure 1 . Each layer contains 16 towers, or \"trajectory segments\", consisting of 4 silicon strips oriented at different angles relative to the incident photon trajectory [4] . In addition there are 8 \"strips\" per tower located behind the silicon sensors but outside of the active volume of the calorimeter [5] . Together they form a total of 56 independent tracking channels [6] ."}

{"text":"We study the possibility that black holes can be retained in binary systems by gravitational radiation reaction even if their initial velocities are very large, and we find that this is possible for certain ranges of parameters.  We consider two types of binaries:  those consisting of one black hole and another compact object (such as neutron star or white dwarf), and those consisting of two black holes.   In both cases, we show how to calculate the final velocity after emission of gravitational waves using post-Newtonian approximations up to third order.  For binaries containing at least one black hole, we also use numerical relativity simulations to check our results.  Finally, we discuss some astrophysical implications of these findings. The discovery of gravitational waves has opened an exciting new window on the universe [1] . One of its most surprising features was the detection of merging black holes [2] , which were found to have masses ranging between about 4M\u2609 and 36M\u2609 [3] . This raises the question whether there exist other ways besides mergers through which black holes may form [4] .\nIn particular, it would be interesting to know what happens when a black hole moves into a binary system composed of either another black hole or a nonblack-hole companion [5] . If the black hole's initial speed is too high, then it will escape the system before emitting enough energy via gravitational waves [6] . However, if the black hole starts out slowly but still faster than the orbital speed of the binary components, then it could potentially be captured [7, 8] .  Here, we investigate this scenario further and determine under which conditions such capture is indeed possible."}
{"text":"We present an analytical model to study decoherence and relaxation processes in a few coupled superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUID) immersed into a phonon bath at low temperatures. The system is described by a chain-boson Hamiltonian with nearest-neighbor interactions, which can be diagonalized exactly using the Bethe ansatz method. We show that this approach allows us to obtain exact results for the dynamics of the reduced density matrix describing the SQUID subsystem as well as its entanglement entropy. In particular we find that the decay rate of the off-diagonal elements of the reduced density matrix scales linearly with temperature T , while the von Neumann entropy grows logarithmically with time t. These findings are consistent with previous numerical studies on similar systems. \n \n Introduction \n \n Superconducting circuits have been proposed recently as promising candidates for realizations of quantum information processing [1] . One important issue in these proposals concerns how to protect qubits against environmental noise [2] . It has been shown theoretically [3] - [6] and experimentally [7] - [9] that coupling between different parts of a circuit may lead to unwanted effects such as dephasing or relaxation. This problem becomes particularly severe when considering large networks of interacting qubits [10] . \n \n Here we consider a simple model consisting of two weakly-coupled SQUIDs [11] immersed into a phonon environment [12] . Our aim is to investigate the effect of the interaction term on the evolution of the reduced density matrix of each SQUID separately. To do so, we use the Bethe ansatz [13] to solve analytically the Schr\u00f6dinger equation corresponding to our model. As expected, we observe that the presence of the interaction leads to decoherence and dissipation phenomena. Moreover, we find that the decay rates of the off-diagonals of the reduced density matrices scale linearly with temperature T , whereas their von Neumann entropies grow logarithmically with time t. \nModel\n\nThe total Hamiltonian H = H0 + V describes the system composed of N = 2 SQUIDs coupled via a weak tunneling amplitude J immersed into a phonon reservoir at zero temperature."}
{"text":"We study how galactic discs warp in response to tidal forces exerted by dark matter haloes and intergalactic gas filaments, using high-resolution cosmological simulations with radiative cooling and star formation. We find that the majority (>80%) of simulated galaxies have significant warping at z = 0. The amplitude of the warp increases with decreasing galaxy mass, but is independent of redshift for massive galaxies. Warp amplitudes are typically less than 10 kpc, which agrees well with observations. Our results suggest that most observed warps can be explained as being caused by external gravitational torques on galactic discs. This implies that there may not exist any intrinsic mechanism within galactic discs themselves that causes warps. In addition, we show that the presence of an AGN does not significantly affect the shape or strength of the warp. Finally, we demonstrate that our model predicts a correlation between the direction of the warp and the angular momentum vector of the host halo."}
{"text":"We present the first simultaneous broadband (0.5-10 keV) spectral analysis of the neutron star low-mass X-ray binary system 4U 1728-34 using data obtained with XMM-Newton, Chandra, Suzaku, Swift-XRT and RXTE. We find that the source spectrum is well described by an absorbed blackbody plus power-law model in all observations except for one observation where we detect emission lines at 6.7 and 7.1 keV which are consistent with being produced by highly ionized iron. The temperature of the blackbody component varies between 0.6-0.9 keV while its radius ranges between 3-7 km depending on whether or not the absorption column density was allowed to vary freely during fitting. In addition, we also found evidence for a soft excess below 1 keV in some of our spectra. Using these results as input parameters, we simulated light curves based on the continuum models used in this work. Our simulations show that the observed flux variations can be explained solely due to changes in the blackbody normalization factor without requiring any additional variability mechanism such as obscuration effects."}
{"text":"We present an explicit characterization of the set of separable states for two qubits or three qutrits, respectively, as well as the corresponding sets of maximally entangled states.

INTRODUCTORY REMARkS\nThe problem of determining whether a given mixed state is separable (i.e., it can be written as a convex combination of product states), has been studied extensively over the past decade [1] . In particular, this question was shown to be NP-hard [2] , which implies that no efficient algorithm exists for solving it exactly [3] .\nIn spite of its apparent difficulty, several useful sufficient conditions have been derived [4] - [8] . These include the positive partial transpose criterion [9] , the realignment criterion [10] , and the Peres-Horodecki criterion [11] . However, none of them is necessary [12] . Moreover, they do not provide any information about how many product terms should appear in such decomposition [13] . This makes their practical use limited [14] .\nRecently, there were some attempts at finding exact solutions for special classes of problems [15] - [17] . For example, it was shown that all 2 \u00d7 D dimensional density matrices with rank \u2264 1 are separable [18] . Also, it was proved that all 3 \u00d7 D dimensional density matrices whose spectrum consists of nonnegative integers are separable [19] . Finally, it was proven [20] that if a 4 \u00d7 D matrix satisfies certain additional constraints then it must be separable."}
{"text":"We present the first systematic survey of X-ray flares observed in gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows with the Swift satellite, which has been operating since 2004. We find that most GRBs show at least one X-ray flare during their prompt or early afterglow phase; we also find that some GRBs have multiple flaring episodes. The majority of these flares are soft, but there is evidence for both hard and very-hard flares as well. In addition to studying individual flares, we examine the spectral properties of all flares combined using time-resolved spectroscopy techniques. Our results indicate that the average spectrum can be described by an absorbed power law model with photon index \u0393 = 1.6 \u00b1 0.1 and hydrogen column density NH = 2 \u00d7 10^22 cm^{-2}. \n \n Using this best-fit model, we calculate the total energy emitted in each flare over its duration. For the entire sample of flares studied here, we find that the mean fluence of the flares is ~10^-7 ergs\/cm^2, while the mean peak luminosity is ~10^45 ergs\/s. These values correspond to typical energies released in solar flares."}
{"text":"We present an agent-based computational model for simulating the growth and invasion of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs). The model is based on a hybrid cellular automaton that incorporates both discrete and continuous variables, which are updated simultaneously at each time step using a set of coupled ordinary differential equations. We use this framework to simulate tumor growth in three dimensions under different conditions including varying levels of oxygenation and nutrient availability as well as treatment strategies such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Our results show that our model can reproduce several key features observed experimentally during NSCLC development and progression. In particular, we find that hypoxic regions develop within tumors due to rapid proliferation of cells leading to insufficient blood supply. These hypoxic regions promote angiogenesis by secreting pro-angiogenic factors into the surrounding tissue thereby creating new vessels through sprouting and branching processes. Finally, we demonstrate how our model could be used to study drug efficacy against NSCLC."}
{"text":"The composition of cosmic rays is studied by measuring their energy spectrum and mass distribution at Earth. The most precise measurements are obtained using ground-based detectors, which measure extensive air showers produced in interactions between cosmic rays and atmospheric nuclei. In this work we present results on the measurement of shower depth profiles as well as several composition sensitive observables derived from them. These include the number of muons per meter water equivalent (N_m), the fraction of muons to electrons at 1000 m above sea level (f_1000) and the average logarithmic mass ln(A). We compare these results for different zenith angles and energies. For primary particles heavier than protons, f_1000 increases while N_m decreases with increasing zenith angle. This effect can be explained by the fact that heavy primaries interact higher up in the atmosphere where they produce more muons but fewer electrons compared to lighter primaries. At lower energies there seems to be an excess of events with low values of N_m and high values of f_1000 indicating a possible contribution from light primaries such as helium or nitrogen."}
{"text":"The Standard Model (SM) is an extremely successful theory, but it leaves many questions unanswered about physics at very high energies. In particular, there are no known fundamental principles that can explain why the SM has three generations of quarks and leptons with such different masses or how gravity fits into this picture. Theories beyond the Standard Model attempt to address these issues by introducing new particles and\/or interactions which may be observed in future experiments.  Supersymmetry (SUSY), for example, introduces partners for all SM fields whose spin differs by one half unit. These partner states have identical gauge quantum numbers as their SM counterparts, so they could mix with them if SUSY were broken at low energy scales. This mixing would lead to deviations from SM predictions for observables like cross sections and decay rates. Many extensions of the Standard Model also predict new phenomena associated with extra dimensions of space-time. For instance, theories based on string\/M-theory often contain additional spatial dimensions compactified down to tiny sizes. If these extra dimensions exist, then we should see evidence of their effects through virtual exchange of Kaluza-Klein excitations of gravitons and other particles between SM fields localized on our four-dimensional world-volume."}
{"text":"We present an alternative thermal derivation of the Coleman-DeLuccia tunneling prescription for black hole formation in de Sitter space-time, which is based on the Euclidean path integral approach to quantum gravity and uses only standard techniques of statistical mechanics. We show that this method reproduces exactly the same results as those obtained by Hawking's original calculation using semi-classical methods. The advantage of our new approach lies in its conceptual simplicity and generality - it can be applied not only to Schwarzschild-deSitter but also to Kerr-deSitter solutions with arbitrary angular momentum. In addition we discuss possible extensions of these ideas beyond the semiclassical approximation.

They have been studied extensively over many years both theoretically [2] , numerically [3] and experimentally [4] .\nThe main difficulty in studying black holes comes from their singular nature at the horizon. This problem has been overcome recently by Hawking [5] who showed how black holes evaporate due to quantum effects. He found that black holes emit particles according to a Planck spectrum [6] \nwhere T H =h\/8\u03c0M P l c 2 is the temperature of the black hole (with M being its mass) and \u03ba = 1\/4G N is the surface gravity of the event horizon. It was shown later [7] that the emission rate \u0393 \u221d exp(\u22128\u03c0M\/M P l ) agrees very well with numerical calculations [8] . However, despite all efforts made so far there still remains some controversy about whether or not black holes really exist [9] ."}
{"text":"We study the statistical properties of Barkhausen noise generated by an Ising spin system with random fields and competing interactions at its surface, using wavelets to analyze the time series produced by this model.  We find that the power spectrum of the Barkhausen signal is well described by a stretched exponential function over several decades in frequency space. The stretching exponent depends on both temperature T and magnetic field H. In particular, we show how the stretching exponent can be used as a measure of the degree of disorder in the sample under investigation. Finally, we discuss possible extensions of our work to other types of systems exhibiting avalanche dynamics. Barkhausen noise (BN) has been studied extensively since it was first observed experimentally more than 100 years ago [1] . It consists of bursts of magnetization reversals which occur when a ferromagnetic material is driven through successive metastable states [2] , and is believed to play an important role in determining the coercive force of such materials [3] .\nThe statistics of BN have attracted considerable interest recently [4] - [8] due to their potential application in non-destructive testing [9] . However, despite many experimental studies [10] - [12] there are still open questions about the origin of these fluctuations [13] . For example, while some authors claim that they arise from thermally activated processes [14] others argue that they result from collective effects [15] or even quantum tunneling [16] . A number of theoretical models [17] - [20] have also been proposed to explain the physics behind BN but none of them seems able to reproduce all features simultaneously [21] ."}
{"text":"We study the evolution of cosmic strings in an expanding universe, focusing on their formation mechanism and subsequent growth. We show that cosmic strings can form when magnetic fields are trapped inside overdense regions during inflation. The resulting network consists of many small loops which evolve into larger ones through gravitational radiation emission. This process is similar to the one proposed for electroweak strings formed at phase transitions after inflation. However, we find that the loop distribution function has a different shape than previously assumed. In particular, it contains more large loops with sizes comparable to the Hubble radius today. These loops may be detectable as stochastic backgrounds of gravitational waves or gamma rays. Cosmic strings have been predicted to exist since the early 1980s [1, 2] . They could arise naturally if there were extra dimensions beyond those observed so far [3] , or they might be produced at symmetry breaking phase transitions [4] .\nCosmic strings would produce observable effects such as gravitational lensing [5] , CMB anisotropies [6] , and primordial black holes [7, 8] . Despite this interest, no direct detection of cosmic strings has yet been made [9] . One reason why cosmic strings remain elusive is because they are expected to be very light (with masses less than $10^{-16}eV$) [10] . Another problem is that cosmic strings are not stable objects but rather decay rapidly via gravitational radiation [11] . Therefore, any observational evidence must come indirectly from the products of cosmic string decays [12] .\nIn order to make predictions about possible observations, cosmological simulations need to be performed [13] . A number of groups have studied cosmic string networks using N-body codes [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64"}

We find that the MDFs are well represented by three Gaussian components centered at [Fe\/H] = -1.7, -0.9, and +0.2 dex, respectively. The metal-poor component is found to be associated with the Galactic thick disk\/halo population, while both intermediate- and high-metallicity populations show significant differences between the two fields. In particular, we detect a large fraction of high-alpha stars in one field but not in another located farther away from the center of the LMC. These results suggest that the origin of these streams may have been triggered by tidal interactions between the Milky Way and its satellite galaxies such as the Sgr dwarf galaxy and\/or the LMC."}

The resulting color-redshift relations are then used to estimate photometric redshifts for all LRG\/cluster candidates selected from the SDSS imaging data. Our results show that this simple approach can yield accurate photometric redshifts over most of the range 0 < z < 1.2 covered by the survey. For example, we find that the rms scatter between the estimated and true redshifts is less than 0.05(1+z), which corresponds to about 60 km\/s at z = 0.6.

Its total luminosity L_TOT = 3.5 x 10^{8} L_SOL corresponds to a B-band absolute magnitude MB = -18.7 mag. This value agrees well with those found by other authors for similar galaxies.

In order to demonstrate its feasibility, we applied our methodology to two clinical cases involving different treatment techniques. For each case, we performed MC calculations using various numbers of histories ranging between 1x10 5 and 2x10 6 . We then compared results obtained by applying our new technique against those produced by conventional methods such as the standard deviation or confidence intervals.

{"text":"We have analyzed the spectral and timing properties of Cygnus X-2 using data obtained with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE). The source was observed for about 100 ks during 1996-1997, when it showed strong aperiodic variability on time scales ranging from milliseconds to hours. We find that the power density spectrum can be described by two components; one is flat below 10 Hz and another has an index of -1 above this frequency. In addition we detect quasi-periodic oscillations at frequencies around 300 Hz which are coherent over several hundred seconds. Using these results as input parameters into our model fitting procedure, we obtain good fits to both the energy spectra and the light curves simultaneously. Our best-fit models show that there exists a correlation between the temperature of the Comptonizing plasma and its optical depth.

We find that these galaxies are distributed in filaments up to several Mpc across, which is consistent with previous studies for more massive galaxies. The LSS shows no significant difference between star-forming galaxies selected by their rest-frame UV luminosity or equivalent widths of Ly\u03b1 emission lines. However, we do not detect any galaxy clusters associated with our sample down to an overdensity limit of $\\sim$10.

{"text":"The spin transistor is an important device for future quantum information processing and communication technologies, but its realization in practice has been challenging due to the lack of suitable materials with large spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Here we propose that graphene can be used as such material by exploiting its unique electronic structure. We show how this leads to a novel type of spin transistor which operates at room temperature without external magnetic fields or applied gate voltages. The proposed device consists of two ferromagnetic contacts connected via a single layer of graphene. By applying a voltage between these contacts one can control the SOC strength in the graphene channel leading to a change in the transmission probability through it. This results in a switching behavior similar to conventional transistors. In addition, our analysis shows that the proposed device exhibits high on\/off ratios even when operating under realistic conditions. Finally, we discuss possible experimental realizations of the proposed device. Graphene is a promising candidate for applications in spintronics because of its unique electronic properties [1] . It offers the possibility to realize devices based on pure spin currents [2] , which are not limited by Joule heating effects [3] .\nIn particular, the spin Hall effect [4] allows for efficient generation [5] and detection [6] of spin currents using only electric fields [7, 8] . However, despite many theoretical proposals [9] , there have so far been very few successful attempts to experimentally demonstrate spintronic devices based on graphene [10] . One reason might be the difficulty to find appropriate materials with sufficiently strong spin-orbit interaction [11] . Another problem is related to the fact that most experiments were performed at low temperatures [12] where thermal fluctuations limit the performance of spintronic devices [13] ."}

{"text":"We study the phase diagram and critical behavior of an anisotropic system consisting of Nx \u00d7 Ny spins on a square lattice, where each spin is described by the two-dimensional XY model. We find that there are three phases depending on the values of J1 \/ J2 (J2 > 0); ferromagnetic state for small J1 \/ J2 , spiral state for intermediate J1 \/ J2 , and paramagnetic state for large J1 \/ J2 . The transition between these states belongs to the universality class of the Ising model. In particular we show that the spiral state has a nontrivial structure which can be regarded as a superposition of ferromagnetically ordered domains with different orientations. This result suggests that the spiral state may have some relevance to the physics of high-Tc cuprates. \n \n Introduction \n \n It was shown recently [1] that the ground-state properties of the twodimensional Heisenberg antiferromagnet with nearest-neighbor interactions depend strongly on whether or not the exchange interaction along one direction vanishes identically. For example, if the exchange interaction along the y-direction vanishes completely, then the ground state becomes ferromagnetic even though it consists only of S = 1\/2 spins. On the other hand, when the exchange interaction along both directions does not vanish simultaneously, the ground state is always antiferromagnetic [2] .\n \nIn this work, we consider another type of anisotropy in the two-dimensional XY model: namely, we assume that the coupling constant along the x-direction is larger than that along the y-direction. As will become clear later, such an anisotropy plays an important role in determining the nature of the ground state."}
{"text":"Reverberation is an important feature of brain function, but its role remains unclear. We show that reverberation can be generated by the interplay between calcium signaling and short-term plasticity (STP) at excitatory synapses. In our model, STP leads to bursts of spikes which are followed by periods of low firing rate due to depletion of neurotransmitter vesicles. The resulting slow recovery of transmitter release causes a build-up of residual calcium concentration [Ca] res , leading to facilitation of glutamate release during subsequent bursts. This positive feedback loop generates sustained reverberatory activity with multiple time scales. Our results suggest that reverberation may play a key role in information processing within neural circuits. Reverberation is one of the most prominent features of brain function [1] . It has been observed across different species [2] - [4] as well as in various brain areas including hippocampus [5] , neocortex [6] , thalamus [7] , striatum [8] , cerebellar cortex [9] , olfactory bulb [10] , and retina [11] .\nDespite its ubiquity, however, it still remains unknown what functional roles reverberation plays in the brain [12] . One possibility is that reverberation serves as a mechanism for memory storage [13] or retrieval [14] . Another hypothesis suggests that reverberation could serve as a substrate for working memory [15] . Yet another idea is that reverberation might provide a means for temporal coding [16] .

{"text":"We consider the problem of scheduling multiple bag-of-work applications on parallel machines with non-cooperative tasks, where each task has its own deadline and budget constraints. We propose an algorithm that is based on the idea of partitioning time into intervals such that all tasks in one interval can be scheduled simultaneously without violating their deadlines or budgets. The proposed algorithm uses dynamic programming to find the optimal schedule for these intervals. Finally, we show how this approach can be extended to handle more general cases by using bin-packing techniques.

{"text":"We present an analysis of helioseismic data for the angular velocity profile of the Sun, which is based on the assumption that the total angular momentum of the Sun is conserved during its evolution. We find that this hypothesis leads to a good agreement between theoretical predictions and observations at all latitudes except near the poles where we observe significant deviations. The discrepancies are explained by taking into account the effects of torsional oscillations in the convective envelope of the Sun. Our results show that these oscillations can be excited by internal magnetic fields generated by differential rotation in the radiative interior of the Sun. This mechanism may also operate in other solar-type stars with strong surface magnetic activity. In our study we use high-precision measurements of the frequency splitting of acoustic modes obtained using space-based instruments (GOLF and MDI) aboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory satellite. \n \n Keywords: Angular momentum, Torsional oscillations"}
{"text":"We study the phase behavior and structure of binary mixtures composed of soft repulsive spheres with attractive depletants, which are modeled as hard-spheres that interact only via excluded volume interactions. We find that these systems exhibit rich phase diagrams including gas-liquid coexistence at low temperatures for all compositions studied here (0.25 < f < 0.75), where f is the fraction of particles made up by the smaller species. The liquid-gas binodal lines shift to higher pressures upon increasing the size ratio between the two components. For large size ratios we observe an additional fluid-fluid transition line along which both fluids have similar densities but different structures. This new fluid state has been observed experimentally in colloidal suspensions containing nonadsorbing polymer chains. Our results show good agreement with experimental data on colloid-polymer mixtures over wide ranges of temperature, pressure, and composition. \nI. INTRODUCTIO N\nThe presence of small particles can dramatically affect the properties of larger ones through depletion forces [1] . These effects play important roles in many physical phenomena such as protein crystallization [2] , gelation [3] , and sedimentation [4] .\nDepending on their sizes relative to each other, the mixture may be either miscible or immiscible [5] . In addition, there exist regions of metastability [6] and even multiple phases [7, 8] . A number of theoretical studies [9] - [11] have investigated the effect of depletion attractions on the phase diagram of simple model systems. However, most of them focused on idealized models neglecting hydrodynamic interactions [12] , finite-size effects [13] , polydispersity [14] , and particle shape [15] . Only recently did some authors [16] take into account more realistic features like Brownian motion [17] , electrostatic repulsion [18] , and van der Waals attraction [19] . Despite this progress, it remains difficult to predict the exact location of the critical point [20] due to strong correlations [21] among the particles [22] . Moreover, the influence of depletion forces on the structural [23] and dynamical [24] properties of complex fluids still needs further investigation [25] .\nIn recent years, experiments [26]"}
{"text":"We consider the problem of computing all eigenvalues of large sparse polynomials with coefficients in \\{\\pm 1\\}, which are known to be NP-hard problems. We present an algorithm that computes all roots of such polynomials by solving polynomial eigenvalue problems (PEPs) for certain matrices whose entries depend on the coefficients of the original polynomial. The PEPs we solve have special structure that allows us to use efficient numerical algorithms based on Krylov subspaces. Our approach is inspired by recent work on delay differential equations, where similar ideas were used to compute the spectrum of time-varying systems. In particular, our method can also be applied to find the stability region of linear switched systems. As a first step towards this goal, we show how to efficiently compute the largest root of a given polynomial using only O(n log n) arithmetic operations over the binary field. Finally, we demonstrate the practicality of our approach by applying it to several examples arising from control theory."}
{"text":"We study the Josephson effect across an S\/F\/S junction where F is a thin film made up of magnetic domains oriented along different directions, and show that this leads to a rich variety of behaviors depending on the relative orientations between the magnetization vectors of neighboring domains.  We find that for certain domain configurations there are regions within which no supercurrent flows at all (the so-called \"dead zones\"). In other cases we observe multiple Andreev bound states inside each dead zone. Finally, we also consider junctions containing two or more parallel layers of ferromagnets separated by nonmagnetic spacers. The results obtained here can be used as guidelines for designing novel devices based on the Josephson effect. Introduction: Superconducting spin valves have been proposed recently as possible candidates for applications such as high-frequency oscillators [1] , microwave detectors [2] , and quantum information processing [3] . These devices consist of a normal metal layer sandwiched between two superconductors, one of them being ferromagnetic [4] .\nIn order to understand how these systems work it is important to know what happens when they are connected together via a weak link. This problem has attracted considerable attention over recent years [5] - [8] . It was shown theoretically [9] and experimentally [10] that if both superconductors are identical then the system behaves like a single superconductor with modified parameters [11] . However, if the two superconductors differ significantly [12] , new phenomena may occur [13] . For example, if one of the superconductors is strongly type-II while the other remains weakly type-I [14] , then the phase difference between the two superconductors will not change continuously but rather jump discontinuously [15] . If the thicknesses of the two superconductors are comparable [16] , then the system becomes similar to a double-barrier structure [17] ."}
{"text":"We present new observations and analysis of the infrared emission lines in the spectra of two yellow hypergiants, IRC+10420 and AFGL2136.

{"text":"We study the dynamics of three agent games with two strategies each, where agents are connected by an underlying network and play pairwise interactions according to their strategy choices. We show that for any initial state there is always at least one absorbing state in which all agents have the same strategy choice. In addition we find that if the number of nodes with either strategy exceeds 1 then this state can be reached within finite time. Finally, we provide bounds on how fast such convergence occurs as well as conditions under which it will occur exponentially quickly. The results presented here generalize previous work done on two-agent evolutionary games to multi-agent systems. Evolutionary game theory has been used extensively over the past decade to model competition between different species or individuals competing for limited resources [1] . A common approach taken when modeling these types of problems is to consider a population consisting of many interacting agents who choose among several possible strategies [2] , and then use mathematical tools developed in statistical physics [3] to analyze the resulting system behavior [4] .\nIn recent years researchers have begun studying more complex models involving multiple populations [5] , spatial structure [6] , and heterogeneous environments [7, 8] . However, most existing research focuses only on two-player games [9] , while less attention has been paid to multi-agent systems [10] . Here we present new results showing that even simple multi-agent systems exhibit richer dynamical behaviors than previously thought [11] ."}
{"text":"We present the results of our analysis on stellar surface structure effects in high precision space-based optical astrometric observations, which are expected to be achieved by future space missions such as Gaia and SIM. We show that these effects can cause systematic errors in the derived parameters for individual stars with precisions better than 1 microarcsecond (mas). The main sources of error include limb darkening effect, gravity brightening effect, and rotational distortion effect. These effects depend strongly on the spectral type of observed stars. For example, we find that the rotationally distorted shape of late-type giant stars may lead to an apparent shift of up to several mas between their positions measured at different epochs. This is comparable or even larger than the accuracy goal set for Gaia mission. Therefore it will be necessary to take into account these effects when analyzing data obtained by future space missions.

{"text":"We present the discovery and timing analysis of two millisecond radio pulsars (MSPs) orbiting an intermediate mass black hole (IMBH). The MSPs are located within the central region of the globular cluster NGC 6397, which is known to contain an IMBH with a mass of about \\(3\\times 10^{3}M_\\odot\\), as inferred by its high velocity dispersion. \n \n We detected both pulsars using the Arecibo Observatory at frequencies between 1.4 GHz and 3 GHz over a span of more than three years. Both pulsars have spin periods less than 10 msec and orbital periods ranging from 0.5 days up to 2 weeks. Their masses range from 1.1 to 1.6 solar masses. These properties place them among the most massive and fastest spinning MSPs ever discovered. They also provide strong evidence that these systems were formed through direct capture of neutron stars by the IMBH rather than via exchange interactions or tidal captures during close encounters with other stars."}
{"text":"We introduce the concept of brane tilings, which are generalizations of tiling groups and can be used to describe many different types of physical systems in terms of their symmetries.  We show that any finite group is isomorphic to some brane tiling group (Theorem 1). In particular, we prove that all Coxeter groups are brane tiling groups (Corollary 2), as well as all Artin groups with torsion-free abelian subgroups (Corollary 3).  As an application, we give a new proof for the classification theorem of finite simple groups by showing how they arise naturally through the action of brane tilings on surfaces (Theorem 4).\nIntroduction\n\nTilings have been studied extensively over the past few decades due to their connections to various branches of mathematics such as number theory, combinatorics, geometry, and physics.   The most famous example of this connection comes from the work of Roger Penrose [Pen91] , who showed that certain patterns observed in nature could be described using tiles whose sides were straight lines but had angles of 60 degrees or 120 degrees instead of 90 degrees.   These so-called \"non-standard\" tilings are now known as Penrose tilings.    Another important class of non-standard tilings was introduced by Thurston [Tho93] .    He constructed examples of tilings where each tile has four sides, two of them being parallel to one another while the other two form a pair of perpendicular bisectors.   This type of tiling is called a quadrilateral tiling.   It turns out that these tilings also appear frequently in nature;  for instance, they occur in quasicrystals, which are materials made up of atoms arranged into periodic structures that do not fit exactly within standard unit cells.   A third class of non-standard tilers was discovered independently by Conway and Lagarias [CL95] and by Wang [Wan96] .\nIn recent years there has been growing interest in studying mathematical models of quantum gravity, string theory, and M-theory.   One approach towards understanding these theories involves constructing spaces..."}
{"text":"We present deep imaging data for the nearby dwarf spheroidal galaxy, Hercules (dSph), obtained with the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT). The new observations are used to study the structure and stellar populations in this system. We find that the surface brightness profile is well described by an exponential function over most of its extent but shows evidence for a break at about 30 arcsec radius. This feature may be associated with tidal disruption or stripping due to interactions between Hercules and other galaxies. Using colour-magnitude diagrams we show that there exists two distinct components within Hercules; one which has been stripped off and another which appears to have remained intact. These results suggest that Hercules was once more extended than it currently is today. Finally, using our photometric catalogue we measure the line-of-sight velocity dispersion as a function of projected distance from the centre of Hercules. Our measurements indicate that the central region of Hercules exhibits higher values compared to those measured further out."}
{"text":"The nonequilibrium steady states (NESS) of matrix product form are the focus of this work, which is intended to be useful for researchers in computational physics and chemistry who wish to solve problems with such NESSs using numerical methods.  The first part of the article introduces the concept of NESSs as well as some basic properties that they possess. In particular, we show how one can construct an explicit representation of any given NESS by solving a linear system of equations whose coefficient matrices depend on the underlying transition rates between different microstates. We also discuss several important issues related to the construction of these coefficient matrices. The second part of the article presents two examples illustrating our approach. Finally, we provide a detailed discussion about various aspects of the proposed method along with possible extensions. Nonequilibrium steady states (NESs), i.e., time-independent solutions of master equations describing open systems far away from equilibrium, have been studied extensively over the past few decades [1] . They play crucial roles in many areas ranging from statistical mechanics [2] , quantum optics [3] , chemical reaction dynamics [4] , and biophysics [5] .\nIn recent years there has been growing interest in developing efficient algorithms for computing NESs [6] - [8] . This is mainly due to their importance in applications where it may not always be feasible or desirable to obtain exact analytical results [9] - [11] . For example, in molecular dynamics simulations [12] , Monte Carlo sampling techniques [13] , and kinetic Monte Carlo schemes [14] , only approximate values of NESs are available. Moreover, even if the exact solution were known, its direct use would still require significant amount of storage space [15] . Therefore, it becomes necessary to develop fast and accurate numerical methods for calculating NESs [16] - [18] .\nThere exist numerous approaches for numerically approximating NESs [19] - [21] . Among them, the most popular ones include the eigenvector-following algorithm [22] , the power iteration scheme [23] , and the Krylov subspace projection technique [24] .

{"text":"We present new results on the asteroseismic analysis of the primary component in the binary system Alpha Centari, based on data obtained with the HARPS spectrograph at La Silla Observatory (Chile). We find evidence for two independent frequencies that are likely to be associated with rotationally split modes. The observed frequency pattern is consistent with theoretical predictions and suggests an inclination angle between 40\u00b0and 60\u00b0for this star. \n \n Keywords: Asteroseismology, Rotation, Binary stars, Oscillations, Frequency analysis, High-precision radial velocities, Alpha Centari ABSTRACT \n \n We report new results on the asterioseismic analysis of the main-sequence F-type star Alpha Centari A, which forms part of a close double system with its cooler companion B. Our study was carried out using high-precision radial-velocity measurements collected over more than four years by the HARPS instrument installed at ESO's 3.6-m telescope at La Silla Observatory (Chilean Andes), together with photometric observations made simultaneously with the CoRoT space mission. By applying standard techniques used in asteroseismology we have detected several periodicities in both datasets, including one signal whose periodicity corresponds exactly to the orbital period of the system. This finding confirms previous suggestions that the pulsational behaviour of this star may be influenced by tidal effects induced by its companion. In addition, our analysis reveals another set of signals corresponding to periods ranging from about 1 day up to almost 2 days. These signals can be explained as being due to rotationally split p-mode oscillations excited in the convective envelope of the star. Their presence provides strong support for the hypothesis that the surface of Alpha Centari A has been shaped by magnetic activity driven by dynamo processes operating within the convection zone."}
{"text":"We present the results of our survey for giant planets around stars that have debris disks and central clearing, using data obtained by the Spitzer Space Telescope's Infrared Array Camera (IRAC). We find no evidence for any new planet candidates beyond those previously reported in the literature.  The lack of detections is consistent with previous studies showing that most debris disk systems are not accompanied by massive planets on wide orbits. Our non-detection suggests that there may be an upper limit to the number of giant planets orbiting within 100 AU of their host star. This work was supported by NASA under grant NNX10AD65G issued through the Astrophysics Data Analysis Program. Keywords: Planet formation; Exoplanet; Debris disk; IRAC; Spitzer Space Telescope; Circumstellar disk; Stellar mass loss. 1 Introduction   Debris disks surround many main-sequence A-type stars at distances ranging from tens to thousands of astronomical units (AU) from their host stars (e.g., Wyatt 2008) . These dusty disks contain large amounts of small grains produced by collisions between larger bodies such as planetesimals or asteroids.   Many debris disks also show clearings near their centers where the amount of dust decreases significantly compared to the surrounding regions (e.g., Bryden et al. 2006 , Currie et al. 2012 . Such central holes can be explained if they were cleared out by one or more planetary companions located close to the central star (e.g., Quillen & Thorndike 2002 , Kenyon & Bromley 2005 .   Recent observations suggest that some debris disks harbor massive planets on wide orbits (\u223c100-1000 AU) (e.g., Greaves et al. 2007 , Lagrange et al. 2009 ). However, it remains unclear whether these planets are common among debris disk hosts because only a few dozen debris disk systems have been searched for planets so far (see Table 2 below).   For example, Bryden et al. (2006) found two debris disk systems with central holes that could be caused by planets on wide orbits but did not report"}
{"text":"In this work, we introduce the higher order Schwarzian derivative (HOSD) to study chaotic behavior in dynamical systems. The HOSD is defined as the second-order differential operator with respect to time variable t acting on the first-order derivatives of the state variables x(t). We show that the HOSD can be used to construct new invariant sufficient conditions of chaos by using its properties such as non-negativity and monotonicity under some suitable assumptions. In addition, it also provides an alternative way to investigate the existence of periodic orbits in nonlinear autonomous systems. Finally, numerical examples are given to illustrate our results. Keywords: Dynamical systems; Chaos; Periodic orbit; Nonlinearity; Higher order Schwarzian derivative. 1 Introduction Let us consider the following nonautonomous ordinary differential equations (ODEs)\nx = f(t; x; u), where f: R \u00d7 Rn \u00d7 Rm \u2192 Rn, (1.1) which describes many physical phenomena arising in engineering fields [1] .

{"text":"We present an analysis of the dynamics of the four giant planets of our Solar System during their formation, using numerical simulations with N-body codes that include hydrodynamical effects (gas drag). We show how these interactions can explain some features observed today on the orbits of Jupiter's Trojans asteroids. In particular we find that:  1) The eccentricities of Jupiter's Trojan asteroids are excited by close encounters between Jupiter and Saturn; 2) The inclination distribution is affected by the presence of gas; 3) The semi-major axes of Jupiter's Trojans are shifted towards smaller values due to the effect of gas friction. These results suggest that the dynamical history of Jupiter's Trojans may be related to the evolution of the protoplanetary nebula surrounding the Sun.

The five-dimensional action contains two terms corresponding to Einstein gravity and Yang-Mills gauge fields respectively. We show that the gravitational constant G and the fine structure constant \u03b1 are related by  G\u03b12 = 8\u03c02R4\/3m5Planck3. In this way we obtain values for these constants which agree well with experimental data. Furthermore, we find that the mass scale mPlanck can be identified as the fundamental Planck mass M0. Finally, we discuss how our results could be tested experimentally. Introduction: It is generally believed that all known interactions including gravitation should be described within one consistent framework at very high energies [1] . This idea leads naturally to the concept of unification [2] , i.e., the description of different forces in terms of a single force carrier or field [3] .\nThe most promising approach towards such a unified theory seems to be string theory [4] . However, despite many efforts over more than twenty years there still exists no convincing evidence supporting its validity [5] . On the other hand, it was shown recently [6] that the standard model of particle physics together with general relativity may emerge from a higher dimensional spacetime picture [7, 8] . In particular, if the additional dimensions are small enough they might not have been detected so far [9] ."}
{"text":"We present new observations of the outflow driven by the young star cluster NGC 1333 IRAS 4A, located at the center of the Perseus molecular cloud (d = 235 pc).

The total mass of the outflowing gas is estimated to be ~0.1 Msun, while its kinetic energy amounts to ~10^50 ergs. These values are comparable to those found for other low-mass protostellar systems. However, we also detect significant differences between this system and others previously studied. In particular, our results suggest that the outflow may have been triggered recently due to the interaction of the central source with another object or structure within the dense core surrounding it."}

We derive atmospheric parameters T eff , log g, microturbulence velocity vmic, and chemical composition including nitrogen abundance [N\/Fe] . For comparison we also analyse a large number of Galactic red supergiants observed by GOSSS project using similar methods. Our results show that there is no significant difference between the mean values of these quantities derived for both samples. However, our analysis reveals systematic differences between different studies based on smaller samples published so far.

{"text":"We consider the linearization problem for the Painleve' equations PIII, PV and PVI in terms of their Lax pairs. We show that these problems are equivalent to certain reductions of the three-wave resonant system. The results obtained here can be regarded as an extension of those by Zakharov et al., who studied the reduction of the two-wave resonant system corresponding to the Painleve' II equation. In particular we prove that there is no non-trivial solution of the linearized PIII or PV equation which decays exponentially at infinity if one imposes some additional conditions on its asymptotic behavior near the origin. \nIntroduction\n\nThe Painleve' equations play important roles both in mathematics and physics (see e.g.  [1] , [4] ). They have been extensively investigated during last decades mainly due to their rich structures such as soliton solutions and B\u00e4cklund transformations.

{"text":"We present an analysis of the basis-set dependence of post-Hartree-Fock (HF) corrections to atomization energies for small molecules, using explicitly correlated Gaussian functions and extrapolation techniques.  We show that the correlation energy contribution is more sensitive than the HF energy to the choice of basis sets used in calculations. The results are compared with those obtained by other authors who have studied this problem previously. Finally we discuss how these findings can be applied to improve the accuracy of thermochemical data calculated at the CCSD(T) level. In recent years there has been considerable interest in improving the accuracy of theoretical predictions of thermochemical properties such as enthalpies of formation or heats of reaction. These quantities are often determined experimentally but it would clearly be useful if they could also be predicted theoretically. One approach which has proved successful involves calculating the total electronic energy E tot [n] of a molecule within some chosen approximation n to quantum mechanics, where n = 1 corresponds to Hartree-Fock theory and n = 2 to second-order M\u00f8ller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2). Corrections beyond MP2 may then be estimated either by performing higher-level ab initio calculations on smaller subsets of atoms [1] , or alternatively by fitting empirical parameters to experimental data [2] ."}

We show that this result agrees with previous results obtained by other methods at one-loop order. The new formula has several advantages over existing expressions:  It does not require any additional approximations beyond those inherent in the use of perturbation theory; it allows us to calculate the effective potential directly without having to solve complicated integral equations first; finally, we are able to obtain the full dependence on temperature and chemical potentials simultaneously. This work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy under Contract No. DE-AC02-76SF00515. In recent years there have been many attempts to determine the effective potential Veff(T) = ln Z(T), where T denotes the temperature, using various techniques such as the imaginary time formalism [1] , the real time formalism [2] or the functional renormalization group (FRG) [3] . These approaches provide useful information about the phase structure of quantum field theories but they usually involve some kind of approximation scheme. For example, in the FRG approach one often uses truncations of the exact flow equation [4] .\nIn this letter we will derive an explicit expression for Veff(T) in terms of renormalisation group functions [5] . Our method is based on the observation [6] that the effective action \u0393k(\u03c6) (where k denotes the momentum scale) satisfies a differential equation known as the Wetterich equation [7, 8] \nHere Rk(\u0393k; \u03c6) is called the regulator function and describes how the infrared modes are suppressed when integrating out high energy degrees of freedom.

INTRODUCTIO N\nThe Dicke model [1] describes how many identical two-level atoms interact collectively with a single mode of electromagnetic field. In recent years there has been renewed interest in studying this model because of its potential application in quantum information processing [2] , quantum optics [3] , condensed matter physics [4] , etc.. For example, the collective spontaneous emission rate of the atomic ensemble depends on the total angular momentum J = N \/2 (N being the number of atoms) [5] .\nIn fact, the Dicke model was originally proposed more than half century ago [6] . Since then various theoretical approaches have been developed to solve it [7 -10] . Among these approaches, the most successful one is probably the so-called HolsteinPrimakoff transformation [11] which maps the original problem into a spin-1\/2 system [12] . This approach works very well at weak-coupling regime where the interaction between atom-field is relatively small. However, it fails completely at large-coupling limit since the mapping procedure breaks down due to the appearance of unphysical states [13] . Recently, several authors [14 -19] have tried to overcome this difficulty by introducing new transformations or approximations. Nevertheless, their solutions still suffer from certain drawbacks [20, 21] ."}
{"text":"We present an extension of the concept of coherence between two univariate signals to pairs of multivariate signals. The proposed measure is based on the generalized cross-spectrum (GCC) which can be estimated by means of Welch's averaged periodogram method or using the multitaper approach. We show that this new measure has several desirable properties such as being invariant under linear transformations in both components of the pair of signals considered. In addition we propose a procedure for removing the contribution at lag 0 due to common sources. This procedure consists of subtracting the average value over all lags of the GCC obtained with one component delayed relative to the other. Finally, we illustrate our results through numerical simulations and real data examples. Coherence measures are widely used in neuroscience to assess functional connectivity among different brain areas. However, most existing methods only consider bivariate relationships between pairs of single-unit recordings. Here we introduce a novel measure of coherence applicable to any number of simultaneously recorded signals. Our measure is based on the Generalized Cross-Spectrum (GCC), which can be estimated either via Welch's averaged periodogramm method or using the multi-taper approach. We demonstrate that it possesses many useful properties including invariance under linear transformations within each signal set. Furthermore, we provide a simple way to remove the contribution at lag 0 arising from common sources. Finally, we illustrate these results with simulated and experimental data."}
{"text":"We have identified a sample of candidate hidden Seyfert galaxies by searching for X-ray sources with hard spectra (\u0393 < 1) and high luminosities (Lx > 1043 erg s-1). We find that these objects are preferentially located at redshifts z ~ 0.7, where they can be detected only if their intrinsic absorption is NH < 1023 cm-2 . The majority of our candidates show no optical counterparts down to R = 25 mag on deep ground-based images; however, we do detect faint emission lines characteristic of AGN activity in some cases. Our results suggest that there may exist many more obscured active galactic nuclei than previously thought. This work was supported by NASA grant NAG5-7262. \n \n Keywords: Active Galactic Nuclei, Galaxy Evolution, X-Ray Astronomy \n \n Introduction \n \n In recent years it has become clear that most bright quasars reside in massive elliptical galaxies or bulges of spiral galaxies (e.g., McLure & Dunlop 2001), but the nature of the host galaxy remains unknown because of heavy dust extinction along the line-of-sight. It is possible that many optically-faint quasars are hosted by less-massive systems such as late-type spirals and\/or low-luminosity ellipticals (e.g., Hao et al. 2005). \n \n To understand how supermassive black holes grow over cosmic time, it is important to study both unobscured and obscured active galactic nucleus (AGNs) across a wide range of environments. However, identifying heavily-absorbed AGNs is difficult due to the lack of strong spectral features associated with them. One way to identify absorbed AGNs is through their X-ray properties. For example, Compton-thick AGNs are characterized by very flat X-ray continua and large equivalent widths of iron K\u03b1 fluorescence lines (EW>500 eV) (see e.g., Risaliti 2002). Another method is based on the fact that absorbed AGNs tend to exhibit higher X-ray-to-optical flux ratios compared to normal galaxies (e.g.."}
{"text":"We report on the first simultaneous infrared (IR) and X-ray observations of Sgr A*, made with the Chandra X-Ray Observatory and the Spitzer Space Telescope in 2007-2008. We find that the IR emission is consistent with being produced by dust heated to temperatures between 100 K and 1000 K; this temperature range corresponds to an observed flux density at 8 microns ranging from 0.1 mJy to 1 Jy. The spectral index of the IR emission does not change significantly during these variations. This result suggests that the physical conditions within the emitting region are relatively constant over time scales as short as one month. These results also suggest that the IR emission may be dominated by optically thin thermal bremsstrahlung rather than synchrotron radiation. \n \n Keywords: black hole physics, infrared astronomy, radio source variability, space telescopes, X-ray astronomy \n \n \n \n Black holes have been predicted to produce intense electromagnetic fields near their event horizons. However, direct observational evidence has remained elusive because of the extreme environment surrounding such objects. One possible way to detect such fields would be through the detection of polarized light emitted close to the horizon. Another possibility involves detecting changes in the spectrum or intensity of the accretion flow onto the black hole itself. Such changes could occur if the magnetic field lines threading the disk were twisted into helical shapes due to differential rotation. If so, they can act like antennae which amplify any incoming waves along them. As a consequence, the local plasma frequency will increase, causing the plasma to become more opaque to lower-frequency waves but less opaque to higher frequencies. Thus, we expect the spectrum of the emission to steepen toward longer wavelengths when the system becomes brighter."}

{"text":"We present X-ray luminosity functions (XLFs) for normal galaxies at z=0.5-2, based on deep Chandra observations of the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey-North field. We use photometric redshifts to select galaxy samples with different stellar masses and star formation rates. The XLFs are derived by fitting the observed number counts using a Schechter function plus an exponential cutoff below Lx=1041 erg s-1. Our results show that the faint-end slope is steeper than -1.0 for all mass bins considered here. For massive galaxies (log(M\/Msun)>10), we find no significant evolution between z=1.6 and 0.7. However, there appears to be some evidence for evolution towards lower characteristic luminosities as well as flatter slopes at higher redshift.

{"text":"We present the results for the beta functions of Yang-Mills and Yukawa theories to second order in perturbation theory using the method of differential renormalization.  We show that our results are consistent with those obtained by other methods, including dimensional regularization.   In addition we discuss how one can use this approach to obtain higher-order corrections to the beta functions. The beta function is an important quantity characterizing quantum field theories (QFTs). It describes the running coupling constant as a function of energy scale. For example, it determines whether or not QFTs have fixed points where the coupling becomes independent of the energy scale. This property has been used extensively to study non-abelian gauge theories such as Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) which describe strong interactions between quarks and gluons. However, calculating the beta function beyond leading order requires knowledge about Feynman integrals containing multiple scales. These integrals cannot be evaluated analytically but only numerically. Therefore, there exist several different approaches to calculate them. One possibility is to apply the technique of dimensional regularization [1] . Another option is to use the method of differential renomalization [2] , which was developed recently [3, 4] .\nIn this work we will focus on the latter approach. Differential renormalization allows us to express all relevant quantities in terms of so-called master integrals. These are defined as vacuum expectation values of products of free fields. They can be calculated perturbatively in powers of the coupling constant. To determine the beta function up to next-to-leading order, i.e., O(g4), we need to know the master integrals to third order in g."}

Our main conclusions are:\n(1) For individual objects we find that the median value of log(M\/LB) is ~-1.8 dex over the range of luminosities probed here.

We have identified more than 1000 infrared point sources associated with these clouds using our source extraction technique. These include protostars, young stellar objects, and background galaxies. In addition we find that there are many extended emission features which may be related to outflows or other phenomena associated with star formation. A comparison between the observed number counts at 24 microns and those predicted based on models of interstellar dust suggests that most of the detected sources are likely to be low mass stars surrounded by disks. This is consistent with previous studies of this region. However, it appears that some fraction of the brightest sources could also be high-mass protostars."}

In addition to the energy level scheme, we also calculate electromagnetic transition probabilities among these states. It is found that our calculation reproduces fairly well the measured B(E2) values but underestimates the B(M1) values significantly.

{"text":"We present an analysis of the relativistic Riemann problem for ideal fluids in two space dimensions, with emphasis on the role played by vortex sheets. We show that the solution to this problem can be constructed as a sequence of self-similar solutions which are determined uniquely up to translations along the x-axis (the direction of propagation). The first step is to construct a family of exact solutions describing the interaction between a planar shock wave and a vortex sheet. These solutions have been obtained previously using different methods but we provide here a new derivation based on the method of characteristics. In particular, we obtain explicit expressions for the density and pressure profiles across the shock front. Next, we consider the case where the initial data consists of a single vortex sheet separating regions of constant density and pressure. This situation corresponds physically to a fluid initially at rest being accelerated impulsively by a piston moving at speed c = 1. We prove that there exists exactly one such solution corresponding to each value of the total mass M . Finally, we study numerically the evolution of more general initial data consisting of several vortex sheets separated by shocks."}
{"text":"We study the production of magnetic fields and their subsequent evolution during the relativistic blast wave phase of gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglow emission, using numerical simulations with high spatial resolution. We find that the magnetic field is amplified to equipartition strength within several hundred milliseconds at most for typical parameters. The amplification occurs mainly through turbulent dynamo action driven by the kinetic energy of the shocked fluid. After reaching its peak value, the magnetic field decays gradually due to adiabatic expansion losses as well as Ohmic dissipation. Our results suggest that the observed X-ray flares are likely produced by internal shocks between shells ejected from different regions inside the progenitor star. \n \n Keywords: Gamma-Ray Bursts, Magnetic Fields, Dynamo Action, Relativistic Blast Wave, Turbulence \n \n 1. Introduction \n \n In recent years there has been growing evidence suggesting that gamma-ray burst (GRBs) may be associated with massive stars (e.g., Woosley & Bloom 2006) . If this is true, then it would imply that some fraction of these stars explode into space while still surrounded by dense stellar winds or envelopes. These environments can significantly affect the dynamics of the explosion and the properties of the emitted radiation. For example, Chevalier et al. (2004) showed that if the density profile of the surrounding medium follows an r-2 power law, then the resulting light curve will exhibit a plateau followed by a steep decay phase. This behavior was later confirmed observationally (e.g., Panaitescu 2005; Kumar & Panaitescu 2008) , which led to the suggestion that many GRBs might originate from such progenitors (e.g., Zhang 2007). However, other authors have argued against this scenario on theoretical grounds (e.g., Ramirez-Ruiz et al. 2005 ) and observational ones (e.g., Lazzati et al. 2009 ). It should also be noted that even though the majority of GRBs seem to follow this general trend, there exist cases where no clear signature of interaction with a wind-like environment could"}
{"text":"We study the distribution of low-lying states on random surfaces with boundaries, which are obtained by gluing together closed Riemann surfaces along their boundary components. We show that this problem is equivalent to counting the number of distinct ways one can tile a given surface using tiles of different shapes and sizes. This leads us to consider the statistical mechanics of an ensemble of interacting particles living on such surfaces. The partition function for these systems turns out to be related to the generating functions of certain classes of Feynman diagrams. In particular we find exact expressions for the free energy density as well as the entropy density at large volume (large genus) limit. These results provide new insights into the structure of the so-called \"string landscape\". Introduction:-In recent years there has been considerable interest in studying the properties of quantum gravity theories defined over spaces with non-trivial topology [1, 2] . One of the most interesting questions in this context concerns the existence of stable ground state configurations corresponding to classical geometries [3, 4] .\nThe simplest example of such a theory corresponds to the case where space-time is taken to have the topology of a torus T 2 = S 1 \u00d7S 1 , or more generally any orientable two-dimensional manifold M g of genus g > 0 [5] . It was shown recently [6] that in this case it is possible to define a consistent set of physical observables associated with the vacuum expectation values of local operators O(x), x \u2208 M g . Moreover, it follows from general arguments [7, 8] that all correlation functions of these operators factorize into products of two-point correlators < O i (x)O j (y) >= C ij \u03b4(x \u2212 y). Here C ij denotes some constant depending only on the positions of points x and y within the underlying geometry [9] .

However, despite its successes, general relativity still fails to explain some phenomena such as dark energy [3] and quantum gravity [4] . Therefore, many alternative theories of gravity were proposed over the years [5] .\nOne of these alternatives is the so-called Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) gravity [6] - [8] . It can be viewed as a natural generalization of general relativity since it includes higher-order curvature corrections [9] . Moreover, this theory admits various interesting solutions including black holes [10]- [12] , wormholes [13] - [15] and even time dependent spacetimes [16] - [18] .

{"text":"We study the adiabatic evolution of an open-boundary spin-1\/2 chain with nearest-neighbor interactions, which is driven by slowly varying external magnetic field and transverse fields. We show that this system undergoes a second-order phase transition at zero temperature when the longitudinal field changes sign. The ground state evolves smoothly through the critical point in the thermodynamic limit but exhibits singular behavior for finite systems. In particular, we find that the fidelity susceptibility diverges as $1\/L$ near the critical point where $L$ denotes the number of spins. This result implies that the adiabatic process fails to be efficient if one tries to drive the system across the critical point using slow driving rates. Finally, we discuss how our results can be generalized to other models exhibiting similar features. Introduction:-Adiabatic quantum computation (AQC) [1] has been proposed as a promising approach towards solving hard computational problems [2] . It relies on the fact that it may be possible to solve certain optimization problems efficiently by evolving the initial ground state of some simple Hamiltonian into the ground state of another complicated problem Hamiltonian via a series of intermediate Hamiltonians [3] .\nIn AQC, the time-evolution operator corresponding to each step of the algorithm is obtained by applying a sequence of local unitary transformations to the identity matrix [4] , i.e., U = exp(\u2212iHt\/h), where H is the instantaneous Hamiltonian describing the physical system under consideration and t is the total duration of the algorithm. If the rate of change of the parameters characterizing the instantaneous Hamiltonians is sufficiently small compared to their characteristic energy scales then the final state will be close to the ground state of the target Hamiltonian [5] . However, there are several issues associated with implementing such algorithms experimentally [6] - [8] . For example, even though the adiabatic theorem guarantees that the final state will be very close to the ground state provided the evolution occurs over many orders of magnitude slower than the inverse gap between the ground and first excited states [9] , it does not provide any information about the speed required to achieve a given accuracy [10] .

{"text":"We present results on the gravitational wave emission during the final stages of black hole binary coalescence, when the holes are surrounded by an accretion disk and their orbital evolution is driven by radiation reaction. We use numerical relativity simulations to study how the mass loss rate due to gravitational waves depends on the spin magnitudes and orientations of the two black holes. Our main result is that for equal-mass binaries with aligned spins (both parallel or anti-parallel to the orbital angular momentum), the total radiated energy increases monotonically as the system loses orbital energy through gravitational waves. For unequal masses and\/or misaligned spins, however, we find that there can be significant fluctuations in the emitted power over time scales comparable to the orbital period.  These fluctuations occur because the amount of gravitational-wave luminosity generated at each instant varies strongly depending on whether the black holes' orbits are circularized or not. The resulting variability may have important consequences for observations of merging galaxies using gravitational-wave detectors such as LIGO\/VIRGO."}
{"text":"The human genome contains thousands of enhancers, which are non-coding DNA sequences that can activate transcription at distant sites. Enhancer activity is often cell-type specific and regulated by the binding of sequence-specific transcription factors (TFs). However, how TFs cooperate to regulate enhancer function remains poorly understood. Here we show that cooperative interactions between two distinct classes of TFs play an important role in regulating enhancer activity during lytic infection with herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), a large double-stranded DNA virus. We find that HSV-1 encodes three proteins - VP16, ICP4 and ICP27 - each containing multiple domains capable of interacting directly or indirectly with other cellular proteins. Using biophysical methods, we demonstrate that these three viral proteins interact cooperatively on a single promoter element to drive expression of genes required for efficient viral replication.

A number of different techniques have been developed to investigate the properties of YMSCs including photometry, spectroscopy, and direct imaging. These methods provide complementary views into the physical processes involved in cluster formation and evolution. For example, photometric surveys allow us to determine the ages and masses of large samples of YMSCs while spectroscopic studies yield detailed measurements of chemical abundances and kinematics. Direct imaging provides spatially resolved information about the internal structure of YMSCs which allows us to probe their dynamical state."}

{"text":"We present results on the statistical properties of earthquake sequences generated by the 2D Burridge-Knopff (BK) model with random initial conditions and periodic boundary conditions, using numerical simulations. We find that the BK model produces power-law distributions for both the inter-event time distribution and magnitude-frequency relation in agreement with observations. The exponent values are found to be dependent upon the system size N . In particular we show that the exponents decrease as 1\/N , which is consistent with previous studies. Finally, we discuss possible reasons behind this dependence. Keywords: Earthquake statistics; Power laws; Random initial conditions; Periodic boundary conditions; Statistical mechanics; Numerical simulation; Burridge-Knopf model. 1 Introduction It has been known since Gutenberg's work [1] that there exists an empirical relationship between the frequency f of occurrence of earthquakes and their magnitudes M : log10(f ) = \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2M .\n(\nThe constants \u03b1 and \u03b2 depend on the region under consideration [2] . This relationship can also be expressed in terms of the number n of events per unit area A within some range [Mmin, Mmax] of magnitudes as: dn\/dA \u221d 10 \u03b3\u2212\u03b4M min where dn\/da \u221d 10 \u03b3\u2212\u03b1M max [3] . For example, if one considers all earthquakes occurring over a period of time T in a given geographical area then it follows that: \nwhere Ntot denotes the total number of earthquakes during the observation period T .

{"text":"We present new observations made with the Cosmosoma experiment, which were designed to search for evidence of an excess in cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature fluctuations above those predicted by standard cosmological models. The data are consistent with predictions based on current theoretical understanding but show some unexpected features that may be related to previously unidentified foreground sources or systematic effects associated with our analysis techniques. \n \n We have used these results to place limits on possible contributions from primordial gravitational waves and other exotic phenomena such as topological defects. These limits are comparable to previous measurements obtained using different experimental approaches. In addition we report the detection of a significant signal at frequencies below 10GHz, which is not expected within conventional cosmological models. This could represent either a new source of foreground contamination or a novel physical effect. Further investigation will require additional experiments to confirm this result and determine its origin. If confirmed it would provide important constraints on theories attempting to explain the observed anisotropy in the CMB spectrum."}
{"text":"The present work is concerned with the development and analysis of a mathematical model describing the dynamics of a copolymerization reaction occurring inside droplets dispersed into water, which are stabilized by surfactants.  The system consists of three partial differential equations (PDEs) coupled through nonlinear boundary conditions at the interface between two phases. In addition to the usual convection-diffusion-reaction terms appearing in such models, we also include diffusion due to Marangoni stresses induced by surface tension gradients across the interface. We prove existence of global weak solutions using Galerkin approximations combined with compactness arguments. Finally, we perform numerical simulations that illustrate our theoretical results. Keywords: Copolymerization; Emulsions; Surface tension gradients; Mathematical modelling. 1 Introduction Polymeric materials have been widely used as coatings on solid surfaces or as additives in many industrial processes including paints, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, food processing etc., see e.g. [21, 22] . A common way to produce these materials involves polymerizing monomers within small droplets suspended in water, called emulsions. This process can be achieved either chemically or physically depending upon whether the droplets contain chemical species necessary for initiating the polymerization reactions or not. For example, if the droplets do not contain any chemicals then they must first be prepared separately before being added to the main mixture containing all other ingredients. Once this has been done, the droplets will begin to grow until their size becomes comparable to the wavelength of light passing through them. At this point, the droplets become optically opaque and the growth continues unabated leading eventually to the formation of large particles known as micelles. These particles may then be separated out from the rest of the solution by centrifugation or filtration techniques. Alternatively, one could use a different type of emulsifier so that the droplets remain transparent throughout the entire process. However, it should be noted that this approach requires additional control over the amount of energy supplied during the process since too much heat generated by the exothermic nature of"}
{"text":"We study the slave-boson mean-field theory for the extended Falicov--Kimball model in two dimensions, which is known to exhibit an interesting phase diagram with various ordered phases and quantum critical points. We show that the ground state energy per site can be expressed as a function of the order parameters by using the saddle-point method. The resulting self-consistent equations are solved numerically on finite clusters up to 16 sites. It turns out that there exist three different solutions depending on the electron filling fraction n = N\/Nc (N: number of electrons; Nc: number of lattice sites). One solution corresponds to the metallic phase where both charge density wave and spin density wave orders vanish. Another one describes the insulating phase characterized by nonvanishing CDW or SDW orders. Finally we find another solution corresponding to the coexistence region between these two phases. In this case, the system exhibits either commensurate or incommensurate charge-density waves accompanied by spiral magnetic ordering."}
{"text":"We present an open-source code, called XSCORT (X-ray Spectral Code for Reprocessed Torus), which computes the reprocessing of radiation by optically-thick matter in the form of a torus and its associated wind. The code is written as a set of IDL routines that can be easily modified to study different geometries or physical conditions. We describe how we implemented our model using Monte Carlo techniques and discuss some tests performed with simulated data. Finally, we show examples of applications of this new tool to two well-studied objects, NGC 4151 and Mrk 509. \nThe main goal of XSCORT is to provide a flexible framework where one can explore the effects of various parameters such as: geometry, density distribution, chemical composition, ionization state, etc., on the observed spectral properties of active galactic nuclei (AGN). This will allow us to better understand their nature and evolution. \n \n In particular, we are interested in studying the effect of the presence of an outflowing component on the shape of the reflection hump produced by the innermost regions of the accretion disc around supermassive black holes. These winds may play an important role in shaping the broad-band continuum emission of these sources through absorption and\/or scattering processes. They also affect the amount of material available to produce the reflected emission at larger distances from the central source."}
{"text":"We present the results on scalar propagator in AdS\/CFT correspondence obtained by using configuration space methods, which are based on Feynman path integral approach to quantum field theory. We show that this method is equivalent with the standard one used in momentum space but it has some advantages over it:  It allows us to obtain exact expressions for the Green functions at all orders in perturbation theory.  The calculations can be done without any reference to the boundary conditions imposed on fields or their derivatives. This makes our approach especially useful when dealing with problems where such conditions cannot be specified unambiguously. In particular we consider two-point correlation function of stress-energy tensor in N=4 SYM theory and calculate its imaginary part up to order $\\mathcal{O}(g^{10})$. We also discuss how to use these techniques to study time-ordered correlators in strongly coupled theories. Finally, we apply them to calculation of retarded correlator of vector current in QED."}
{"text":"We present the results of our study on super star clusters (SSCs) in which we have found that SSCs can be divided into two categories, namely, those having a single mode and those having a double-mode solution for their density profiles. We show how these solutions are related to each other by using approximate analytic methods. The main aim is to understand why some SSCs appear as point sources while others do not. In this work, we also discuss the possibility of formation of such objects through mergers between smaller clusters or stars. Super massive star clusters (SMCs), known as young globular clusters (YGCs), open clusters (OCs), compact elliptical galaxies (CEGs), etc., are observed in many galactic systems ranging from dwarf irregular galaxies to giant ellipticals. These objects are believed to form during violent events like galaxy mergers, tidal interactions, and\/or gas-rich major mergers. However, it has been shown recently that there exists another class of SMCs whose luminosity function shows a peak at intermediate masses (10^6-10^7 Msun). This type of cluster is referred to as \"Intermediate Massive Clusters\"(IMCs; Portegies Zwart et al. (2010)). It appears that IMCs may represent a transition phase between open clusters and YGCs."}
{"text":"We present an algorithm for searching in databases that are stored as qubits, which is the basic unit of information in quantum computers. The search problem can be formulated by using Grover's algorithm and its variants to find one or more solutions among many possibilities. We show how this approach can be used to solve problems such as finding a particular molecule within a large chemical compound library. Our results demonstrate that it may be possible to use quantum algorithms to accelerate searches on future quantum computer hardware. Quantum computing has been proposed as a new paradigm for solving computational problems with applications ranging from chemistry to optimization theory [1-3]. In contrast to classical computers, where data is represented by bits (0s or 1s), quantum computers store information in qubits, which can take any superposition of 0s and 1s [4] . This feature allows quantum computers to perform certain computations exponentially faster than their classical counterparts [5] .\nIn order to make practical use of these advantages, however, we need efficient ways to implement quantum algorithms [6] , including those based on Grover's algorithm [7-9]. Here, we propose a method for identifying unambiguously a single solution out of multiple possibilities [10] . As an example application, our technique could be used to identify a specific molecule within a larger chemical compound library [11] ."}

{"text":"We report on experimental measurements of spatial correlation functions for the dynamics of supercooled liquids at different temperatures, using confocal microscopy and single particle tracking techniques to probe the motion of colloidal particles suspended in glycerol. We find that these correlation functions can be well described by an exponential decay with a characteristic length scale which increases as we lower the temperature towards the glass transition point. This increase is consistent with theoretical predictions based on mode-coupling theory (MCT), but our results show deviations from MCT near the glass transition temperature Tg. These deviations are likely due to dynamic heterogeneities present close to Tg. The data presented here provide new insights into the nature of spatio-temporal fluctuations in glassy systems. Glass-forming liquids exhibit slow relaxation processes over many decades in time scales [1] . In particular, they often display non-exponential relaxations [2] , aging [3] , and other phenomena associated with glassy behavior [4] .\nTheories such as Mode-Coupling Theory (MCT) [5] have been developed to describe this complex phenomenology [6] . However, despite its successes [7, 8] , there remain open questions about how MCT describes real physical systems [9] . One important issue concerns the role played by spatial correlations between local regions where particles move more or less rapidly than average [10] . Such correlations may arise because of cooperative rearrangements [11] and\/or dynamical heterogeneity [12] . It has recently been shown theoretically [13] that spatial correlations play an essential role in determining the shape of the intermediate scattering function Fs(q,t). Here q denotes the wavevector corresponding to the probed lengthscale, while t represents the lag-time used to calculate Fs(q, t).\nIn order to test whether theories like MCT capture all relevant physics, it is necessary to measure experimentally the spatial correlations predicted by those theories. Previous experiments [14, 15] have focused primarily on measuring temporal correlations [16] . Recently, however, several groups [17] - [20] have begun to study spatial correlations directly [21] ."}

The EUV images show that there is an apparent counterclockwise rotation of the bright loop-like structures at the limb between 2011 February 24 and March 1. We find that this rotation can be explained as a result of the differential motion between the two spacecrafts along their orbits around the Sun. By applying a cross-correlation technique to the EUVI 171 \u00c5 intensity profiles observed simultaneously by both satellites, we obtain the velocity field across the solar disk for each time step during the period under study.

We find that for sufficiently high values of these quantities, the jets are stable against kink instabilities up to distances comparable with those observed in radio galaxies.

{"text":"We study the propagation of traveling waves (TWs) in excitable media with spatially distributed parameters, which are subject to both external forcing and internal fluctuations. We show that TWs can be generated spontaneously even if there is no deterministic source for them. The mechanism responsible for this phenomenon is related to the presence of an unstable stationary state between two stable ones. In particular, we demonstrate how spontaneous generation of TWs occurs due to stochastic resonance induced by additive white Gaussian noise. Finally, we present numerical results illustrating the effect of multiplicative colored noise on the dynamics of TWs. Propagation of traveling waves (TW) in excitable media has been studied extensively over recent years [1] . It was shown that TWs may appear as a result of various mechanisms such as: i) intrinsic instabilities [2] , ii) coupling-induced instabilities [3] or iii) forced oscillations [4] .\nIn many cases it is assumed that the medium under consideration is homogeneous so that all its properties do not depend explicitly on space coordinates. However, real physical systems usually have spatial variations of their characteristics [5] . For example, one-dimensional models describing cardiac tissue [6] include heterogeneity in the form of local changes in refractory periods [7, 8] . Another important factor influencing wave propagation is noise [9] . Noise plays different roles depending on whether it acts additively [10] or multiplicatively [11] . Moreover, noise may also affect the shape of the propagating front [12] ."}

{"text":"The adiabatic motion of relativistic charged particles is studied in the framework of the Hamilton-Jacobi theory and its generalization to arbitrary curved space-times, which are described by general relativity (GR) or modified gravity theories such as scalar-tensor theories.  The main goal of this work is to derive an explicit expression for the energy-momentum tensor associated with the adiabatic motion of these particles on backgrounds that can be either static or time-dependent. This problem has been addressed previously only within the context of GR, where it was shown that the energymomentum tensor satisfies the covariant conservation equation if one assumes that the particle's four-velocity is parallel transported along geodesics. Here we show how this result follows naturally from our formalism without any additional assumptions about the geometry of spacetime.

{"text":"We show that the observed value of the cosmological constant is systematically affected by the presence of matter around us, and we calculate this effect for different models of dark energy.  We find that the correction can be significant (up to 30%) if one assumes that the universe has an average density equal to the critical density today. The correction becomes smaller when the universe is less dense than the critical density or more negative pressure is assumed. This systematic error may explain why the current measurements are not consistent with each other within their errors. In addition, it could also affect future experiments aimed at measuring the time evolution of the cosmological constant. Introduction -The recent discovery of accelerated expansion of our Universe [1] , which implies existence of some form of \"dark energy\" [2] , leads naturally to the question about its nature [3] . One possibility is that the dark energy is simply vacuum energy [4] . Another option is that the dark energy consists of new particles such as axions [5] .\nIn order to test these ideas observationally, precise measurement of the properties of dark energy is needed [6] . However, there are several difficulties associated with this task [7, 8] . For example, even though the present-day acceleration of the universe is very small compared to the Hubble parameter H 0 = 100h km\/s\/Mpc [9] , where h \u2248 0.7 \u00b1 0.1 [10] , the corresponding change in the scale factor over the age of the universe is large enough so that the effects on the distance-redshift relation cannot be neglected [11] . Moreover, since the dark energy affects both space and time [12] , it changes the rate of clocks [13] and thus introduces additional uncertainty into the determination of distances [14] . Finally, the fact that the dark energy evolves with time [15] makes the problem much harder [16] .\nOne way to overcome these problems is to measure directly the equation-of-state w(z), defined as [17] \nwhere p de and \u03c1 de are respectively the pressure and density of the dark energy. If the dark energy behaves like a perfect fluid then w(z) \u2261 \u22121 [18] . It was shown recently [19] that the most"}

{"text":"We present an efficient numerical scheme to detect the existence of periodic orbits in chaotically behaving dynamical systems, such as chaotic maps or chaotic flows. The proposed algorithm is based on the concept of shadowing trajectories which are close approximations of unstable periodic orbits embedded within the attractor. We show that our approach can be used to efficiently compute the topological entropy of chaotic maps with non-integer slopes. Finally we demonstrate how this new technique can be applied to study the dynamics of a model system describing the interaction between two coupled semiconductor lasers. Periodic orbits play an important role in understanding the behavior of many nonlinear dynamical systems. In particular they provide valuable information about the underlying structure of the attractors associated with these systems. However, it has been shown that finding all periodic orbits of a given periodicity may not always be possible due to their complicated nature [1] . This problem becomes even more challenging when dealing with chaotic systems where the number of periodic orbits increases exponentially with increasing period [2] .\nIn recent years there have been several attempts to develop techniques to find periodic orbits numerically [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] , but most of them suffer from one or both of the following drawbacks: (i) They require very high computational resources. (ii) They do not guarantee convergence towards the desired orbit. Here we propose a novel numerical scheme to overcome these difficulties by using the concept of shadowing [9] . Shadowing refers to the property of some trajectories being close approximations of unstable orbits embedded inside the attractor. It was first introduced by Anosov [10] who showed that every trajectory starting sufficiently close to any unstable periodic orbit will remain close to it for at least a certain amount of time.

{"text":"We report on the observation of electronic spin transport across macroscopic distances (several millimeters) in suspended single-layer graphene devices at room temperature.  The experiments are performed using nonlocal spin-valve measurements with ferromagnetic contacts made by sputtering Co\/Ni multilayers onto exfoliated flakes of graphite, followed by annealing to form cobalt silicide contacts. We observe that the resistance-area product RA is strongly dependent upon the contact geometry; for example, we find that it decreases significantly when the length of one of the contacts increases beyond 1 micron. This behavior can be explained by considering the effect of disorder scattering near the interface between the metal and the carbon atoms. In addition, we show that the magnitude of the spin signal depends sensitively on the relative orientation of the magnetization directions of the two ferromagnets. These results demonstrate that the observed spin signals arise primarily due to spin injection into the graphene layer rather than being dominated by proximity effects or other mechanisms associated with the magnetic contacts themselves."}

{"text":"We report the discovery and characterization of an unresolved binary system consisting of two late-type dwarf stars, SDSS J080531.8+481233.0AB (hereafter referred to as J0805+4812). The primary component is classified as a T6p dwarf star with a mass of ~70 MJup while its companion has been identified as a cool brown dwarf candidate with a temperature between 1000-2000 K. We have used high-resolution near-infrared spectroscopy obtained at Gemini Observatory in order to confirm that both components are gravitationally bound. Our analysis shows that this object is one of the most massive known binaries composed by two low-mass objects.

{"text":"We present chemical abundances for a sample of 16 Planetary Nebulae (PNe) in the Small Magellanic cloud, obtained with high resolution spectroscopy at the VLT and Keck telescopes. The PNe are located along an age sequence ranging between 1 Myr to 13 Gyrs. We find that the abundance patterns of CNO elements show no significant differences among these objects. This is consistent with previous studies which found little or no evidence for enrichment by AGB stars during this period.  However we do detect some variations in the Ne\/O ratio as a function of time. These results suggest that the SMC experienced two episodes of star formation separated by about 10 billion years. In addition, our data indicate that there was only one episode of massive star formation within the last 2 billion years. Finally, we compare our results with those derived from H II regions and young open clusters in order to investigate possible systematic effects due to different evolutionary stages and\/or stellar populations."}
{"text":"We study energy density-flux correlations for a free scalar field in 1+1 dimensions, both at finite temperature T and in vacuum (T=0). We show that these correlation functions are nontrivial even when evaluated on the light cone x+x=t+t0=2ct. In particular we find that they exhibit power law behavior with exponents which depend continuously on c. This is in contrast to what happens in ordinary quantum mechanics where such correlators vanish identically outside the light cone. The results presented here can be obtained by using standard techniques developed within the framework of thermofield dynamics. They provide further evidence that this formalism provides a useful description of thermal states also beyond equilibrium situations. Energy density-flux correlations play an important role in various physical phenomena ranging from hydrodynamics to particle production processes in heavy ion collisions. However their calculation has been hampered so far by the fact that it requires knowledge about off-diagonal elements of the two-point function of the corresponding operator. Here we present explicit expressions for these quantities for a free massless scalar field theory in one spatial dimension."}

The calculated values for the orbital-to-spin ratio agree well with experimental data obtained via neutron scattering experiments. In addition we find that all studied systems exhibit non-collinear magnetic structures due to competing exchange interactions between neighboring atoms.

The sample consists of about 1 million objects located within a region centered on the galactic center that is known as \"Plaut's window\".  We find that our results are consistent with previous measurements made using POSS-II plates combined with HST observations. However, we also find significant differences when compared to other recent studies based on similar datasets but different analysis techniques. These discrepancies may be due to systematic errors introduced during the reduction process or they could indicate real changes in the structure of the bulge over time.

{"text":"We present the results of N-body simulations aimed at studying tidal disruption and accretion in interacting galaxy pairs, with particular emphasis on the formation of tidally stripped dwarfs (TDGs). We find that TDG formation is strongly dependent upon the orbital parameters of the interaction; specifically, we show that TDGs form only when the encounter has an impact parameter less than about twice the sum of their effective radii.  In addition to this dependence on orbital geometry, our models suggest that TDGs are more likely to be formed if the progenitor galaxies have high gas fractions and\/or low central surface brightnesses. Finally, we argue that TDGs may provide useful probes for testing theories of gravity on galactic scales. The discovery of numerous examples of \"tidal dwarf galaxies\" (TDGs) over the past decade or so has led many authors to propose these objects as possible sites of star formation during interactions between massive spiral galaxies. However, despite considerable observational effort, there remains no consensus regarding either the frequency of TDG formation or even whether such systems actually exist outside the confines of numerical simulations."}
{"text":"The cosmological constant is one of the most important parameters in modern physics, and its value has been determined by observations to be extremely small but nonzero.  In this article we will discuss how it can be explained as an effect of quantum gravity at very high energies. We will also show that if the universe underwent inflationary expansion after the Big Bang then there should exist primordial gravitational waves which could have observable effects on the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR). Finally, we will argue that these effects may provide us with new ways for testing the predictions of general relativity against those of alternative theories such as string theory or loop quantum gravity. The cosmological constant is one  of the most important parameters of modern physics. Its value was determined by observations to be incredibly small but non-zero. It plays a crucial role in our understanding of the evolution of the Universe since it determines whether the current accelerated expansion of space-time will continue forever or eventually slow down and stop. This question remains open despite many years of research into the nature of dark energy."}
{"text":"We consider an inflationary universe with a scalar field that is slowly rolling down its potential hill, and we show how this model can be used to explain the observed temperature fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR). We find that the spectrum of density perturbations produced by such a scenario has a characteristic shape which depends on the slope of the potential at the minimum. In particular, if the potential is flat enough then there are two peaks in the power spectrum corresponding to scales of about 1 Mpc and 100 kpc respectively. The first peak corresponds to the scale of galaxy clusters while the second one gives rise to galaxies themselves. \n \n This kind of model predicts that the number of e-foldings between the time when the observable universe was 10^-32 cm and today should be around 50-60. If so, it would imply that our present horizon size is only slightly larger than the Hubble radius during inflation."}
{"text":"We present an improved method for analyzing the primordial power spectrum in terms of its underlying physical parameters, using the technique of \"flow equations\" to evolve the initial conditions through the entirety of cosmic time. We show that this approach can be used to place limits on the values of these parameters by comparing theoretical predictions with observations of large-scale structure and CMB anisotropies. In particular we find that the current data is consistent with a flat universe dominated by dark energy (w = -1), but inconsistent with models where w > -0.8 or w < -2\/3 at 95% confidence level. This result agrees well with previous analyses based on other techniques. \n \n The results presented here are derived from the WMAP 5-year temperature map [1] , combined with measurements of galaxy clustering [2] . They are also compatible with recent results obtained independently by the Planck satellite [3] .\n \n \n Our analysis shows that it will soon become possible to use the observed shape of the primordial power spectrum as a powerful probe into the physics of early-universe cosmology."}

The results showed that treatment with MCR1 or MCR3 significantly inhibited cell growth by inducing G0\/G1-phase arrest and apoptosis through activation of caspase-3\/7\/9 signaling pathways. In addition, we found that both MCR1 and MCR3 suppressed expression levels of cyclins D1 and E as well as CDK4\/6 proteins but increased p21WAF1\/cip1 level. Furthermore, our data indicated that MCR1 and MRC3 blocked the binding between insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) and retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (RB).

{"text":"We present the first results on the chemical composition and kinematics of stars in the central region (r < 1 kpc) of the nearby giant elliptical galaxy NGC 3379, based on high-resolution spectroscopy obtained with VLT\/FLAMES\/GIRAFFE. We find that the stellar population is dominated by old metal-poor stars (age > 10 Gyr), but also contains an intermediate-aged component (2-10 Gyr). The latter has solar metallicity and shows evidence for rotation around the major axis of the galaxy. In addition to these two components we detect a third one which consists of young metal-rich stars (age < 2 Gyr) at large galactocentric distances (> 5 kpc). These are likely associated with tidal debris stripped off during interactions between NGC 3379 and its neighbors. Our analysis suggests that this galaxy hosts three distinct populations of stars: i) an inner halo made up of old metal-poor stars; ii) an outer halo containing both old and intermediate-aged metal-poor stars; iii) a thick disk consisting of young metal-rich stars."}

We have used these images to measure magnitudes for more than 1000 candidate red giant branch (RGB) stars within an area of 1 arcmin radius centered around the galaxy's center. These measurements are compared to those derived by Kundu & Whitmore (1998) , who observed this same field using ground-based telescopes.

{"text":"We propose that the vacuum state is not empty but contains fluctuations in spacetime, which we call holographic noise (HN). We show how this HN can be used to explain several phenomena such as spontaneous emission, blackbody radiation, Casimir effect, Lamb shift, and Hawking radiation. In particular, we argue that the vacuum fluctuation leads to an uncertainty principle between energy and time. This implies that there are no particles with zero mass or spin. The existence of these particles would lead to violations of causality. Finally, we discuss some possible experimental tests for our proposal. Vacuum fluctuations play important roles in quantum field theory. They give rise to many interesting effects including spontaneous emission [1] , blackbody radiation [2] , Casimir effect [3] , Lamb shift [4] , and Hawking radiation [5] . However, it remains unclear what exactly constitutes the vacuum state [6] .\nIn this work, we propose that the vacuum state does not contain only the absence of matter fields but also fluctuations in spacetime [7, 8] . These fluctuations may be viewed as virtual gravitons [9] . We refer to them as holographic noise (H N ) because they arise due to the entanglement between different regions on the boundary of space-time [10] . As shown below, H N plays crucial role in understanding various physical processes involving vacuum states.\nThe main idea behind our approach is illustrated by Fig.  1(a) . Imagine two observers Alice and Bob who live at opposite ends of a closed universe. Each observer has access to half of the total degrees of freedom inside their own causal diamond [11] . For example, if Alice lives near the center of her universe she will have access to all information about events within her past light cone while Bob's knowledge is limited to his future light cone. Since both observers cannot see each other, they must communicate via signals traveling through the bulk of space-time [12] . If Alice sends a signal to Bob then he receives it after a certain amount of time t AB = d\/c where c is the speed of light and d is the distance between Alice and Bob.

{"text":"We study the nonlinear dynamics of semiconductor superlattices (SLs) under an external magnetic field, which is applied at an angle to SL layers. We show that this configuration leads to new types of bifurcation phenomena such as period doubling cascades and chaotic attractors. The results are obtained by solving numerically the coupled Schr\u00f6dinger-Poisson equations for the electron wave function and electrostatic potential using the split-step Fourier method. \n \n In particular we consider GaAs\/AlGaAs SLs grown along [001] direction on top of a semi-insulating substrate. This system has been studied experimentally in Refs. [1-3] where it was shown that the application of a magnetic field perpendicularly to the growth axis causes the formation of Landau levels. However, if the magnetic field is tilted away from the normal incidence then the degeneracy between different Landau levels is lifted leading to additional effects like Bloch oscillations [4] . \n \n For example, in Ref. [1] , the authors observed the appearance of a series of peaks in the photoluminescence spectrum when they increased the strength of the magnetic field. These peaks were attributed to the excitation of electrons across the energy gap into higher-lying states. It should be noted however that these experiments have not yet revealed any evidence of chaotic behavior or other complex dynamical features predicted theoretically [5-7] . \n \n Here we present numerical simulations showing how the tilting of the magnetic field affects the nonlinear dynamics of the system. Our calculations reveal several interesting features including periodic windows, period-doubling cascade and chaotic attractor."}
{"text":"We present an analysis of satellite galaxies, fossil groups (FGs), and galaxy clusters in the Millennium Run simulation. We find that FGs are rare objects with only 0.5% of all halos being classified as such at z=0. The number density of FGs is consistent with observations for systems with Mvir>1013M\u2299\/h. However, we also find that there exists a population of low-mass FGs which have not been observed yet but may be detectable by future surveys. In addition to their rarity, FGs show several other interesting properties compared to normal galaxy clusters: they tend to reside in more massive dark matter haloes than normal galaxy clusters; they contain fewer bright central galaxies; and they exhibit higher velocity dispersions. These results suggest that FGs can provide important constraints on models of galaxy formation and evolution. This work was supported by NASA grant NAG5-10842."}
{"text":"We present new observations of the solar atmosphere obtained with the Solar Ultraviolet Imager (SUVI) onboard the Coriolis satellite, which show dynamic fibrils in both H-alpha and CIV lines. The SUVI data are compared to simultaneous ground-based observations made at Big Bear Observatory using the 1-meter telescope equipped with an H-Alpha filter and a Fabry-Perot interferometer tuned to the CIV line. We find that the observed structures have similar properties as those seen previously by other authors but we also see some differences between them. In particular, our results suggest that the fibril structure is more complex than it was thought before. This complexity may be related to the fact that these structures are formed under different physical conditions. Our analysis shows that the observed features can be explained by assuming that they represent plasma flows along magnetic field lines. These flows could play important role in heating up the upper layers of the solar atmosphere."}
{"text":"We study the spin-1\/2 Heisenberg model on the square lattice with nearest-neighbor (NN) exchange interactions J1, J2, and J3 along x-, y-, and z-directions respectively. We show that this system can be mapped onto an effective spin-1\/2 XXZ chain by using the Holstein-Primakoff transformation for spins 1\/2. The ground state phase diagram is obtained numerically by exact diagonalization method. In addition to the N\u00e9el ordered phase at small values of |J2\/J1| < 0.5, we find two different types of quantum disordered phases depending upon the value of J3\/J2. For large values of J3\/J2 > 1.0, there exists a gapless singlet phase where all excitations are gapped out except one massless excitation corresponding to the Goldstone mode associated with the spontaneous breaking of translational symmetry. On the other hand, when J3\/J2 < 0.5, there appears another type of disordered phase which has a finite energy gap between the ground state and first excited states. This phase corresponds to a valence bond solid phase where each site forms singlets with its NN sites only.

{"text":"We present the results of an investigation into the spatial distribution and temporal evolution of magnetic field strength in active region plage using high-resolution spectropolarimetric data obtained with Hinode\/SOT-SP. We find that, on average, the magnetic field is stronger at higher heights above the solar surface (i.e., closer to the limb) than it is near disk center. The mean unsigned longitudinal magnetic flux density decreases by about 50% between 0.3\u2032\u2032 and 1\u2032\u2032 above the solar surface. This decrease occurs over a range of heliocentric angles where the photospheric plasma \u03b2 increases significantly. In addition, we find evidence for significant horizontal structuring of the magnetic fields within individual pixels. These findings are consistent with theoretical predictions based upon magnetohydrodynamic simulations of coronal heating driven by small-scale convective motions. Finally, we show how these observations can be used as input parameters for models of chromospheric heating via Alfv\u00e9n waves generated by resonant absorption."}
{"text":"The ability to identify individual nanoparticles is essential for understanding their properties, but this task can be challenging due to the high degree of structural similarity between different types of particles. In this review we discuss recent advances in nanoparticle characterization using scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)-based techniques that provide information on both chemical composition and structure at atomic resolution. We also highlight some of the challenges associated with these methods as well as possible solutions. Finally, we present an overview of current applications of STEM-based approaches for identifying nanoparticles and suggest future directions for research.  Keywords: Nanoparticles, Characterization, Transmission Electron Microscopy, Scanning Transmission Electron Microscope, Atomic Resolution, Structure, Chemical Composition. The ability to identify individual nanoparticles has become increasingly important over the past decade because it allows researchers to correlate specific physical or chemical characteristics with particle size, shape, surface chemistry, crystal phase, etc., which are all known to influence the performance of many materials. However, despite significant progress made during the last few years, there remains considerable uncertainty about how best to characterize nanoparticles by combining multiple experimental parameters into one single descriptor. This problem arises mainly because nanoparticles often have similar compositions and\/or structures, making them difficult to distinguish based solely on elemental analysis or conventional imaging techniques such as bright-field TEM or SEM."}
{"text":"We consider the problem of estimating the generation interval distribution in an epidemic outbreak, using only information on the number of cases at each time point. We show that this is possible under certain conditions by deriving a formula for the probability generating function (PGF) of the generation interval distribution as a solution to a system of differential equations with boundary conditions corresponding to the observed case counts. The PGF can be used to calculate any moment or other statistic of interest about the generation interval distribution. In particular we derive expressions for the mean and variance of the generation interval distribution which are valid when the total number of cases grows exponentially fast over time. Finally, we apply our results to two real-world datasets, one concerning measles outbreaks in England between 1963 and 1998, and another concerning SARS outbreaks in China during 2002-03. Our method provides estimates of key epidemiological quantities such as the basic reproduction number R0 and the serial interval distribution, without requiring detailed contact tracing data."}
{"text":"In this work, we propose an encounter based worm interaction model to evaluate the performance of different node characteristics in terms of their ability to detect and prevent worms spreading over mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). We consider two types of nodes with distinct capabilities for detecting and preventing worms: normal nodes that are vulnerable to infection by worms but can detect them using signature detection techniques; and immune nodes which have no vulnerability to worm infections but can prevent worm propagation through quarantine mechanisms. The proposed model is used to study how these two types of nodes interact when they meet each other during network operation. In particular, our results show that: 1) Immune nodes play a significant role in reducing the number of infected nodes as well as the total number of encounters between susceptible and infectious nodes; 2) Immune nodes should be deployed at strategic locations within MANETs; 3) Immune nodes should not only focus on quarantining infectious nodes but also on isolating suspicious nodes; 4) Immune nodes should use both signature detection and quarantine mechanisms simultaneously to achieve better performance against worm propagation; 5) Immune nodes should adopt dynamic quarantine strategies instead of static ones since static quarantine may lead to unnecessary isolation of legitimate nodes."}

In addition to Fe I lines, we also use Mg I triplet lines in order to determine their atmospheric parameters more accurately. For some of these stars, we detect significant overabundances for CNO elements as well as s-process elements; however, there is no clear correlation between the abundance patterns and pulsation periods. These results suggest that the observed abundance anomalies may be caused by mass transfer during binary evolution rather than internal mixing processes associated with stellar pulsations.

{"text":"We consider the problem of power allocation in discrete-input delay-limited fading channels with multiple users and time-varying channel gains. We propose an iterative algorithm to solve this problem by using convex optimization techniques, which is shown to converge within finite number of iterations under certain conditions. The proposed algorithm can be implemented efficiently through parallel processing at each iteration step. Numerical results show that our proposed scheme outperforms existing schemes significantly. \n \n Keywords: Power control; Convex optimization; Time-varying; Multiple access channels (MACs); Wireless communications; Iterative algorithms. 1 Introduction \n \n In wireless communication systems, it has been well recognized that the performance of multi-user transmission depends on how the available resources are allocated among different users [1] . For example, when there exist multiple users sharing a common radio resource such as bandwidth or transmit power, the optimal way to allocate these resources may depend on the specific system settings [2] , e.g., whether the users have equal priority [3] , what type of services they request [4] , etc.. Therefore, efficient resource allocation strategies should take into account all relevant factors so as to maximize overall network utility [5] .\n \nIn recent years, considerable research efforts have been devoted to studying various aspects of resource allocation problems [6] - [8] . Among them, power allocation plays an important role due to its direct impact on both spectral efficiency and energy consumption [9] . However, most previous works assume continuous input alphabets [10] - [12] , while practical digital modulation schemes usually employ discrete constellations [13] . As a result, the conventional approaches cannot be directly applied to discrete-input scenarios [14] . To address this issue, several studies [15] - [17] have investigated the power allocation problem over discrete-input channels recently. Nevertheless, their solutions either require high computational complexity [16] or suffer from slow convergence speed [17] ."}
{"text":"The authors present the results of their study on the influence of temperature fluctuations in the Earth's core on its magnetic field. They show that these fluctuations can be described by an oscillating function with a period of about 1000 years, which is close to the observed periods of geomagnetic reversals and excursions. This result suggests that the origin of such phenomena may lie in the dynamics of the Earth's core rather than in external factors. \n \n In this work we consider the effect of temperature fluctuations in the Earth\u2019s core on its magnetic field using a simple model based on the concept of \u201cthermal micropulses\u201d (TMP). We assume that TMPs are generated at random times within some time interval $[t_0, t_1]$ and have different amplitudes $A_i$ and durations $\\Delta t_i$. These pulses cause changes in the heat flux through the CMB and lead to variations in the convective flow velocity inside the fluid core. As a consequence, they produce perturbations in the magnetic field of the Earth. To describe the evolution of the magnetic field during one cycle of TMP generation, we use the induction equation for the vector potential $\\mathbf{A}$ together with the continuity equation for the density of electrical current $\\mathbf{J}$. For simplicity, we neglect the effects of rotation and stratification of the fluid core as well as the presence of the liquid outer core. Our analysis shows that the solution of the problem has two types of singularities corresponding to the so-called \u201csecular\u201d modes. One type corresponds to the case when all TMPs occur simultaneously; another occurs if only one pulse appears during each cycle. It turns out that both solutions correspond to periodic functions with characteristic periods $T_s = 2\\pi\/\\omega_s \\sim 1000$ yr. Thus, our results suggest that the origin of geomagnetic reversals or excursions could be related to the dynamics of the Earth\u2019s core rather than to external factors."}
{"text":"We present an overview of the phase space approach to special relativity, which is based on the concept that all physical quantities are represented by functions defined over a four-dimensional manifold called spacetime. The main idea behind this approach is that it allows one to eliminate gravitational singularities and thus provides a natural framework for describing quantum gravity phenomena. We also discuss some recent results obtained within this formalism. In particular we show how the standard description of black holes can be modified so as to avoid the appearance of such singularities. Finally, we argue that the phase space approach may provide new insights into the problem of time in quantum gravity theories. This article is part of the themed issue 'Quantum gravity'. Phase spaces have been used extensively in classical mechanics since their introduction by Hamilton more than 150 years ago. They represent the state of any system at each point in its configuration space (the set of all possible states) through a function known as the phasespace density. These densities evolve according to a continuity equation known as Liouville's theorem, which describes how they change with respect to time."}
{"text":"We study the dynamics of an analog recurrent neural network (RNN) driven by temporally fluctuating white noise in its synapses, and show that it can be described by the Thouless-AndersonPalmer (TAP) equations. We derive these TAP equations using replica theory applied to the RNN's partition function. The resulting TAP equations are exact up to corrections which vanish exponentially fast as the number N of neurons increases. In particular we find that the TAP free energy is given by F = \u2212kBTN ln ZN + O(1\/N2), where kB denotes Boltzmann's constant and TN \u2261 1\/ZN is the temperature associated with the fluctuations in the synapses. This result shows that the TAP approach provides a good description even when the system size is small compared to the typical correlation length of the noise. Finally, we use our results to calculate the stationary state distribution of the RNN and compare this prediction against numerical simulations."}

{"text":"The Standard Model (SM) is an extremely successful theory, but it has some problems that need to be addressed before we can claim to have found \"theory of everything\".  The SM does not explain why there are three generations of quarks and leptons with different masses or how neutrinos acquire mass. It also fails to provide any explanation for dark matter in our universe.   In this talk I will discuss my recent work on addressing these issues by introducing new particles into the SM which interact only gravitationally. These new particles are called gravitons and they carry spin-2 quantum number like graviton in general relativity. We show that if gravitons exist then their interactions with other fields lead to generation dependent masses for fermions as well as small Majorana masses for neutrinos. Gravitons also contribute to the energy density of the universe leading to possible solution to the problem of missing dark matter. Finally, we argue that gravitons may play important role in understanding hierarchy between Planck scale and electroweak scale."}

Gamma-rays can be detected indirectly via their interaction with Earth's atmosphere, producing showers of secondary particles which emit light when they reach the ground level. These so-called air-shower photons can then be observed using large optical detectors such as imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs). IACTs have proven to be powerful instruments for studying cosmic phenomena like active galactic nuclei or supernova remnants. However, due to their relatively small fields-of-view, they usually require several hours of observation time per source before significant detection significances can be achieved. To overcome this problem, new generation IACT arrays were built recently, consisting of multiple telescopes distributed across wide areas. One example is the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) [1] , where four telescopes observe simultaneously the same region of the sky. Another one is the Telescope Array for Cosmic Triggerd Events (TACTIC), which will consist of eight telescopes spread out over a distance of about 1 km [2] ."}
{"text":"The Marcus-Lushnikov process is the continuous-time analogue of the discrete-time L\u00e9vy walk model introduced by Montroll-Weiss in 1965 to describe diffusion-limited aggregation (DLA) on fractal surfaces.  The DLA growth mechanism has been observed experimentally for many years but only recently have there been attempts at modelling it mathematically using stochastic processes such as the Marcus-Lushnikov process.   In this article we consider two related problems concerning the Marcus-Lushnikov model:  Firstly, we prove that if the jump distribution of the underlying L\u00e9vy process satisfies certain integrability conditions then the corresponding Marcus-Lushnikov process converges weakly to Brownian motion with drift; secondly, we show how the Marcus-Lushnikov model can be used to approximate the solution of Smoluchowski's coagulation-fragmentation equation which describes the evolution of particle size distributions in chemical reactions involving clusters of particles. We also discuss some connections between the Marcus-Lushnikov and Flory's models of polymerisation."}
{"text":"We present the Bridge algorithm, which is an efficient direct tree hybrid n-body method that can be used to simulate fully self-consistently star clusters in galactic potentials with arbitrary mass distributions. The Bridge algorithm combines the advantages of both direct-summation (DS) and tree methods by using DS only within small sub-groups of particles at each time step while solving the full system of equations on a tree. We show that this approach allows us to achieve high accuracy without sacrificing computational efficiency. In particular we demonstrate that our new code reproduces results obtained with the state-of-the-art treecode NBODY6++GPU very well even when simulating systems containing up to 10 million stars. This makes it possible to study the long-term dynamical evolution of open clusters as well as globular clusters orbiting around parent galaxies over many Gyr timescales. \n \n Keywords: Open cluster; Globular cluster; Galactic potential"}
{"text":"The autoignition characteristics of two cyclic hydrocarbons, cyclopentane (CP) and cyclohexane (CH), are investigated using the rapid compression machine coupled with a shock-tube facility at temperatures ranging between 300 K and 1000 K under atmospheric pressure conditions. The ignition delay times for both fuels increase as temperature increases due to an increased rate of chemical reactions. At low temperatures below 600 K, CP has longer ignition delays than CH because it is more difficult for the fuel molecules to overcome their activation energy barrier. However, above 700 K, the opposite trend occurs where CH exhibits longer ignition delays compared to CP. This can be explained by the fact that the higher molecular weight of CH leads to slower diffusion rates which results in lower reactivity.  In addition, the effect of equivalence ratio on the ignition delay time was also studied. It was found that increasing the equivalence ratio decreases the ignition delay time for all tested temperatures except at 800 K where no significant difference could be observed."}

{"text":"Neutrinos are neutral leptons that can oscillate between different flavors, and the phenomenon is described by the Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata (PMNS) matrix. The PMNS matrix contains three mixing angles \u03b812, \u03b823, \u03b813 and one complex phase \u03b4CP which describes possible CP-violation effects. In this work we study how to probe CP violation using atmospheric neutrinos detected at IceCube Neutrino Observatory. We show that it will be possible to measure the value of sin(2\u03b813), if its magnitude is larger than 0.1, as well as the sign of cos(\u03b4CP). This measurement would provide important information on the origin of matter-antimatter asymmetry observed in our universe. \n \n Introduction \n \n Neutrinos are neutral leptonic particles that can change their flavor during propagation through space-time. These changes occur because of quantum mechanical interference effects: when two or more mass eigenstates propagate together they interfere destructively or constructively depending on their relative phases [1] . If there exists an intrinsic difference between these phases then the probability for detecting a certain flavor after traveling some distance differs from what would have been expected without such differences [2] .\n \nThe phenomenon of neutrino oscillation has been confirmed experimentally [3] , but the exact values of the parameters describing the process remain unknown [4] . One of them is the so-called Dirac phase $\\delta_{CP}$ [5] , which determines whether the total lepton number $L$ is conserved [6] . It also affects the amount of baryon asymmetry produced in the early Universe [7, 8] . Therefore measuring the value of $\\delta_{CP}$ could shed light on the physics behind the generation of matter-antimattery asymmetry [9] . \n \n There exist several experiments searching for CP violation in the neutrino sector [10] . However, most of those experiments use accelerator-based beams of neutrinos [11] . On the other hand, neutrino telescopes detect cosmic neutrinos coming from all directions [12] . They offer unique opportunities to perform measurements complementary to those performed in accelerators [13] . For example, neutr"}

{"text":"We present the results of our analysis on the polarization power spectrum in Bianchi type I cosmological models, which are anisotropic generalizations of standard FRW cosmologies. We find that there is no significant difference between the temperature fluctuations predicted by these two classes of models at large angular scales (low multipoles). However, we show that this is not true when one considers the polarization fluctuations. In particular, we demonstrate that the presence of an anisotropy parameter leads to a suppression of the low-l polarization power relative to the high-l part of the spectrum. This effect can be used as a test for distinguishing Bianchi type I models from their FRW counterparts. \n \n The observed lack of large-scale polarization in the WMAP data has been interpreted as evidence against inflationary scenarios with tensor perturbations. It was shown recently that such a conclusion may be premature if one takes into account possible deviations from statistical isotropy in the primordial universe. Indeed, it turns out that some anisotropic cosmological models predict less large-scale polarization than their isotropic counterparts do."}
{"text":"We study the stability properties of planar streamers in air, which are ionized regions that propagate into un-ionized gas under the influence of an applied electric field. We show how to use the so-called \"pulled front approach\" to derive a nonlinear evolution equation for the shape of such fronts and then analyze this equation using standard techniques from dynamical systems theory. In particular we find that there is a critical value of the applied voltage beyond which the planar solution becomes unstable with respect to small perturbations. This result explains why it has been so difficult to observe stable propagation of streamers at high voltages experimentally. The results presented here should be relevant not only to atmospheric discharges but also to other physical situations where similar phenomena occur, e.g., combustion flames or chemical waves on catalytic surfaces. Streamers are thin channels filled with highly conducting plasma that can form when strong electric fields are present between two electrodes immersed in non-conducting gases [1] . They have attracted considerable interest over many years because they play important roles in various applications including lightning [2] , sprites [3] , and high-voltage switches [4] .\nIn recent years much progress has been made towards understanding their formation mechanisms [5, 6, 7, 8] as well as their dynamics [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96,"}

{"text":"We present the results for dark matter annihilations into gamma rays and neutrinos using an improved treatment of subhalos within galaxy clusters, including their internal structure as well as tidal stripping effects on their outer parts. We find that this leads to a significant increase (by up to one order of magnitude) in the predicted fluxes at energies above 1 GeV compared with previous studies. The effect is particularly strong when considering nearby galaxy clusters such as Virgo or Coma. This has important consequences for current and future experiments searching for signals from dark matter particles. In particular, we show how our predictions can be used to derive constraints on the properties of dark matter candidates by comparing them with existing data from Fermi\/LAT and IceCube\/DeepCore. Introduction: Dark matter (DM), if it exists, may interact weakly with ordinary matter through its self-annihilation products [1] . If DM consists of new light particles, then these interactions would produce detectable signatures in cosmic ray spectra [2] , gamma-ray emission [3] , and high-energy neutrino production [4] .\nIn recent years there have been many attempts to detect DM indirectly via observations of astrophysical objects which are expected to contain large amounts of DM [5] . These include dwarf galaxies [6] , galaxy clusters [7, 8] , and galactic haloes [9] . However, no convincing evidence for DM annihilation has yet been found [10] . One possible explanation for this lack of detection could be that most of the DM mass resides in small-scale structures [11] , which are not resolved observationally [12] . Another possibility is that the DM density profiles inferred from gravitational lensing measurements [13] do not accurately reflect the true distribution of DM [14] . Finally, it should also be noted that some models predict very low rates of DM annihilation [15] .\nThe aim of this work is to investigate whether the inclusion of substructure information improves the prospects for detecting DM annihilation products. To achieve this goal, we use high-resolution N-body simulations [16] to study the impact of subhalo populations on the resulting gamma-ray [17] and neutrino [18] fluxes produced by"}

{"text":"We study the electronic properties of armchair-edged carbon nanotubes with magnetic flux piercing them, using density functional theory (DFT). We find that for tubes with diameter larger than 1 nm there is no significant difference between the results obtained by DFT and those predicted by the effective-mass approximation. For smaller diameters we observe deviations which are attributed to the breaking of the valley degeneracy due to the curvature effects. The Aharonov-Bohm-effect manifests itself as an oscillatory behavior of the energy gap when varying the applied magnetic field strength. In addition, we show how this effect can be used to tune the bandgap of these structures. Graphene nanorings have been proposed recently as building blocks for novel nanoelectronic devices such as transistors or spintrons [1-3]. These systems exhibit interesting physical phenomena like the quantum Hall effect [4] , persistent currents [5] , and Klein tunneling [6] . Recently it has also been shown that they may serve as efficient single photon sources [7, 8] .\nIn order to understand their transport characteristics one needs to know the dependence of the energy spectrum on various parameters such as the radius R, the number N of hexagons along the circumference, and the external magnetic field B. This problem was addressed theoretically within different approximations [9-13] but only very few studies were performed based on first-principles calculations [14-16].

Our main focus will be on small-diameter tubes where the curvature leads to important modifications compared to large-diameter tubes [18] ."}
{"text":"The transcription process is driven by the enzyme RNA Polymerase (RNAP) that moves along the template strand of double stranded DNA and synthesizes an mRNA molecule in front of it. The RNAPs are highly dynamic enzymes, which can pause or arrest at specific sites during their translocation through the gene sequence. In this work we study how these pauses affect the overall rate of transcription using a coarse-grained model for the dynamics of multiple RNAP molecules moving simultaneously on a single DNA chain. We show that the presence of pausing leads to a reduction in the average speed of transcription elongation as well as to a decrease in the total number of synthesized mRNAs per unit time. These results suggest that the observed heterogeneity in the rates of transcription may be due to differences in the density of paused RNAPs between genes. Transcription is one of the fundamental processes in all living organisms where information stored in the form of genetic code is converted into messenger RNA (mRNA). This conversion takes place inside the cell nucleus when the enzyme called RNA Polymerase (or simply RNAP) binds with promoter region of the gene and starts copying its sequence [1] . During transcription, the RNAP travels along the template strand of doublestranded DNA and synthesizes an RNA molecule in front of itself [2] .\nIn recent years there has been significant progress towards understanding the mechanism behind transcription [3, 4] , however many questions remain unanswered [5] . One such question concerns the effect of pausing events on the overall rate of transcription [6] . It was shown experimentally [7, 8] that the RNAPs tend to pause frequently while traveling through the gene sequence. Moreover, the duration of each pause event varies widely depending on the type of the gene [9] . For example, some genes have short pauses lasting only few milliseconds [10] whereas others exhibit much longer pauses up to several seconds [11] ."}

Our results are based on a novel reduction to the maximum matching problem in bipartite graphs. Finally we prove that our approach can be extended to find approximate solutions within a factor of 2k-1. The Independent Transversal Problem asks whether there exists a set S of vertices such that every edge connects two different elements of S. This problem was introduced by Karp as one of his 21 NP-complete problems [Karp72] . In recent years it received renewed interest due to applications in computational biology [Fang+10] , social network analysis [Bhattacharyya+09; Karger+00] , and data mining [Liu+12; Liu+13] .\nIn this work we consider the following generalization of the Independent Transversal Problem.

These discrepancies can be explained if one assumes that there are additional bodies in the system whose gravitational influence leads to the observed large eccentricity of the orbit of C."}
{"text":"We study the relaxation behavior in the Random Energy Model (REM) with an external magnetic field, which is one of the simplest models to describe glassy phenomena. We show that the relaxation time distribution function has a universal form independent of temperature and system size by using numerical simulations on finite-dimensional systems up to dimension d = 8. The universality holds even when we take into account the effect of quenched disorder. This result suggests that the relaxation process in this model can be described as a superposition of many processes each of which obeys the same scaling law. In addition, we find that the relaxation time distribution functions at different temperatures are well fitted by a stretched exponential function. These results suggest that the relaxation process in our model is governed by a broad spectrum of relaxation times. Introduction:-The Random Energy Model(REM), proposed by Derrida [1] ,is one of the simplest models describing glassy phenomena [2] .In this model,the energy landscape consists of N local minima whose energies are randomly distributed according to some probability density P(E).Each minimum corresponds to a metastable state and its lifetime \u03c4i is determined by the Arrhenius law exp[\u2212Ei\/kBT ] where Ei denotes the activation energy barrier between two neighboring states i and j.It was shown numerically [3] that the relaxation time distribution follows a power-law decaying function f (\u03c4 ) \u221d 1\/\u03c4 1+\u03b1 with \u03b1 \u2248 1.3 \u2212 2 depending on the dimensionality of the system [4] .\nRecently it was found [5] that the relaxation time distribution also follows a power-law decay if we consider the case without any quenched disorder but with a random initial condition instead.This indicates that the relaxation process in the REM is dominated by activated events over barriers separating different metastable states [6] .However,it should be noted that these studies were performed only for low dimensions such as d \u2264 4 [7, 8] .Therefore,in order to understand the nature of glassy phenomena more clearly,we need to investigate whether or not the above mentioned results hold true in higher dimensions."}

The two stars are separated by only 0. \u2032\u2032 1 and have been known to be magnetically active for many years. We find that both stars show significant circularly polarized emission lines indicative of Zeeman splitting due to their magnetic fields. In addition we detect Stokes V signatures indicating net linear polarization across all observed spectral lines. This is likely caused by scattering processes within the stellar atmosphere.

However, these algorithms often require some form of data redistribution during their execution [5] . For example, consider a computation where each process stores part of a dataset (e.g., matrix) [6] . If the number of processes changes at runtime, then all processes need to exchange information about which parts of the dataset they store before continuing [7] . This problem becomes even more challenging if the size of the datasets stored by individual processes varies [8] or if there are dependencies between them [9] ."}
{"text":"We present an analytical model for high-order harmonic generation (HHG) in diatomic molecules, which is based on the concept of molecular orbitals and their associated electronic wavefunctions. The HHG process can be understood as a sequence of three steps: First, electrons are ionized by strong laser fields. Second, they propagate through the continuum until rescattering with parent ions occurs. Third, these returning electrons emit high harmonics when interacting again with the driving field. We show that this picture leads to a simple expression for the emitted harmonic intensity, which depends only on two parameters characterizing the molecule's orbital structure. This result allows us to explain the observed interference patterns between different harmonics in terms of destructive or constructive interferences between contributions from different molecular orbits. In addition, we demonstrate how our approach can be used to predict the emission properties of new types of molecules. High-order harmonic generation (HHG), i.e., the coherent emission of photons at odd multiples of the fundamental frequency of intense femtosecond laser pulses, has attracted considerable interest over recent years [1, 2] . It provides access to extreme ultraviolet radiation [3] , which enables novel applications such as attosecond pulse generation [4] , photoelectron spectroscopy [5] , and tomography [6] .\nThe underlying physical mechanism behind HHG was first explained within the semiclassical three-step model [7, 8] : An electron tunnels out of its atomic core into the continuum upon interaction with the electric field of the laser light. Afterwards it propagates freely before being driven back towards the nucleus by the same field. Finally, it recombines with the parent ion emitting a photon whose energy equals the sum of the kinetic energy gained during propagation and the binding energy lost due to tunneling [9] . Since then, several extensions have been developed [10] including the so-called quantum-orbit theory [11] , which takes into account the influence of the nuclear potential on the electron dynamics [12] . However, despite all efforts made so far, there still exist many open questions regarding the microscopic origin of HHG [13] ."}

They can be found in biological systems such as proteins [7][8][9], but also occur in synthetic materials like micelles [10]-[12]. A common feature of these systems is their ability to form compact structures due to strong shortrange attractions combined with longer-ranged repulsions. This leads to a double-well type of potential energy landscape [13][14][15], where particles tend to aggregate into clusters [16]. These aggregates may undergo structural changes [17], resulting in transitions between different states [18]. Such phenomena are often observed experimentally [19][20][21] [22]. However, despite extensive research efforts there still remain open questions about the nature of the underlying mechanisms leading to these complex behaviors [23]."}
{"text":"We present Spitzer Space Telescope observations in the mid- to far-infrared (5.8 - 160 microns) for a sample of distant galaxies selected by their rest-frame ultraviolet luminosity density at 1600 angstroms, and compare these flux densities with those predicted using models that include dust extinction.  We find that the observed infrared emission is generally higher than expected based on the UV continuum slope alone; this excess emission can be explained if there are significant amounts of cold dust associated with star formation activity in these systems.   The results suggest that the majority of the energy produced by young stars may not escape into intergalactic space but instead is reprocessed by interstellar dust grains before being re-radiated in the infrared.

{"text":"The photoelectric effect is one of the most important discoveries in physics, and it has been taught to students since its discovery more than 80 years ago. However, there are many misconceptions about this phenomenon that have not yet been addressed by traditional teaching methods. In this study we developed an inquiry-based curriculum using research findings on student difficulties with the concept of energy as well as their ideas about light emission and absorption. The results show that our approach was effective at improving students' understanding of the photoelectric effect. This article describes how we used research into student thinking to develop a new way of teaching the photoelectric effect. We also present evidence showing that our approach improved students' conceptual understanding of the topic. The photoelectric effect (PE) is one of the most significant discoveries in physics [1] . It has been studied extensively over the past eight decades [2] , but despite all these efforts some aspects of PE remain poorly understood [3] .\nIn particular, students often struggle with concepts such as energy [4] , light emission [5] , and light absorption [6] . These difficulties can be attributed to several factors including the fact that PE involves phenomena occurring across different physical scales [7, 8] . For example, when studying PE, students need to understand atomic processes involving photons [9] while simultaneously considering macroscopic effects like current generation [10] . Another factor contributing to student difficulties is the lack of appropriate instructional materials [11] . Traditional textbooks do not provide enough information about the underlying mechanisms involved in PE [12] or they focus too much on mathematical derivations [13] ."}
{"text":"We present the results of an extensive multi-wavelength survey of two nearby (< 1 kpc) and well-studied star-forming regions, Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC), NGC 2024, in order to investigate their physical properties as well as those of individual protostars embedded within them. We have obtained near-infrared images with Subaru\/Suprime-Cam at JHKs bands for ONC region and Spitzer\/IRAC 3.6-8.0 micron data for both regions. In addition we used archival radio continuum observations made by VLA at 6 cm and 20 cm wavelengths. Using these datasets, we performed photometry on all point sources detected above 5 sigma level in each band. By comparing our infrared photometric measurements with theoretical evolutionary models, we found that most of the objects are likely to be Class I or flat-spectrum protostellar candidates. From the analysis of spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting using radiative transfer modeling code, we derived the mass accretion rates onto the central stars ranging between 10-700 x10-6 Msun yr-1 ."}
{"text":"The magnetic reconnection is one of the most important processes for understanding many phenomena observed in space and laboratory plasmas, such as solar flares, magnetospheric substorms, sawtooth crashes in tokamaks etc.. In this work we present an analytical model which describes the process of magnetic reconnection in collisionless high energy plasma with arbitrary initial conditions. The main idea behind our approach consists in using the concept of generalized force density tensor (GDFT) introduced by MHD theory. We show that GDFT can be used not only to describe the macroscopic dynamics but also microscopic properties of the system like particle distribution functions. Our results are compared with those obtained within other approaches based on kinetic description of particles motion. It turns out that all these models give similar predictions when applied to simple cases where the initial state has no gradients along the direction perpendicular to the background magnetic field. However, if there exist some gradients across the magnetic field lines then different models predict quite different behavior."}

We also present follow-up observations of this candidate using adaptive optics techniques that confirm its substellar nature. \n \n The second object lies outside the core radius of the cluster and has an estimated mass below 0.01 M . This companion may be either a planetary or very-low-mass stellar companion depending on whether it formed through gravitational instability or fragmentation during cloud collapse.

{"text":"The new reactor is based on the principle that nuclear fusion can be achieved by heating plasma to high temperatures in magnetic fields.  The proposed design uses an array of magnets and electrodes, which are powered by microwave generators, to heat hydrogen gas into plasma at 100 million degrees Celsius (1,000,000 K). This temperature is sufficient to cause nuclear fusion reactions between deuterium nuclei inside the plasma. In this way, energy is released as neutrons and gamma rays. These particles then bombard fuel pellets made up of tritium and lithium-6, causing them to release more energy through further nuclear fusion reactions. The resulting power plant would produce electrical power with no moving parts or radioactive waste products. It could also provide propulsion systems for spacecraft without requiring any chemical fuels. A conceptual drawing of the reactor system is shown below. Nuclear fusion has been studied extensively since its discovery over 50 years ago. However, it remains elusive because the conditions required to achieve fusion are extremely difficult to create experimentally."}

{"text":"We introduce the concept of algebraic charge liquids, which are defined as ground states of Hamiltonians with local interactions that can be written in terms of fermionic creation and annihilation operators. We show how to construct such models for any finite group G by using an explicit representation of G on the Hilbert space of spinless fermions. The resulting model is exactly solvable when G has no non-trivial subgroups. In this case we find that there exists at least one phase transition between different phases characterized by distinct topological orders. For example, if G = Z2 \u00d7 Z2 then our construction yields two gapped phases distinguished by their chiral central charges c\u2212 = 0 or 1. If G contains a nontrivial subgroup H then the system exhibits gapless excitations corresponding to particles transforming according to irreducible representations (irreps) of H. These results provide new insights into the classification problem of quantum many-body systems."}
{"text":"We study the effects of selection biases in cluster samples, as well as covariance between observables, on scaling relations derived from X-ray data using mock galaxy clusters generated with the semi-analytic model GALFORM. We find that both these effects can lead to significant systematic errors when deriving cosmological constraints from observed scaling relations. In particular we show that: (i) The scatter in the M-T relation is significantly reduced by including additional information about the temperature distribution function; this effect is stronger for low mass systems. (ii) The slope of the L-M relation depends strongly on whether or not one includes cooling flows in the analysis. This dependence arises because cool cores are more common at high masses than at lower masses, leading to an apparent steepening of the slope if they are excluded. (iii) The normalization of the Y-Xray luminosity-temperature relation shows strong redshift evolution which cannot be explained solely by self-similar evolution."}
{"text":"Spin-based electronics is an emerging field that has attracted considerable attention in recent years, due to its potential for applications such as high-density data storage and high-speed information processing.  In this review article we discuss the basic concepts underlying bipolar spintronic devices based on semiconductor heterostructures with ferromagnetic contacts. We first introduce the physics behind spin injection into semiconductors using tunnel barriers or Schottky diodes. Then we describe how these injected spins can be manipulated by means of external magnetic fields and\/or electric currents. Finally, we present some examples of spintronic devices including spin-LEDs, spin transistors, and spin-logic circuits. The main focus will be put on GaAs-based structures but also other materials systems are discussed briefly. This article is intended to provide a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art research in the field of bipolar spintronics. It should serve both as a guide for newcomers interested in learning about the fundamentals of spin transport phenomena at interfaces between metals and semiconductors, and as a reference source for researchers working in related areas."}
{"text":"We present an analysis method for the detection of solar neutrinos using radioactive sources in combination with Ge detectors, which is based on a Bayesian statistical approach. The method allows to take into account all relevant experimental uncertainties including those related to background subtraction as well as systematic effects such as energy calibration or detector efficiency variations over time. We apply this new method to two different experiments at Gran Sasso National Laboratory (Italy): Borexino and GNO. In both cases we find that our results are compatible within their respective error bars with previous analyses but show smaller errors due to improved treatment of systematics.

AMS-02 collaboration has recently reported [1] the most precise measurement so far of the positron fraction up to energies of about 300 GeV. It shows a clear excess above the expected astrophysical background [2] . While there have been several attempts to explain these observations [3] , it remains unclear whether they can be attributed to dark matter annihilation [4] .\nIn order to test possible explanations of the observed excess, one needs to know how many positrons are produced per annihilation event. For example, if dark matter particles annihilate predominantly into leptons, then the total number of electrons plus positrons produced per annihilation should equal four times the number of photons produced [5] . If instead dark matter annihilates mostly into quarks, then the ratio between electron-positron pairs and gamma rays will depend on the mass spectrum of the final state hadrons [6] ."}
{"text":"The author considers an alternative approach to classical electrodynamics, which is based on the concept of \"pre-metricity\" introduced by Einstein in his work \"On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies\" (1905). The main idea behind this approach consists in introducing into consideration not only the usual electromagnetic field tensor F\u03bc\u03bd but also its dual counterpart *F\u03bc\u03bd . In order to obtain equations for both fields simultaneously one has to introduce additional terms into Lagrangian density L(F\u03bc\u03bd ,*F\u03bc\u03bd ) that are quadratic with respect to derivatives of these fields. It turns out that such modified Lagrangian leads to the following set of equations: \nwhere  is the d'Alembert operator,  is the energy-momentum tensor of matter fields, and  is the current four-vector describing the flow of electric charge. \nIn addition to the standard Maxwell's equations, Eqs.

The derived properties are then compared between two galaxy samples -one consisting of spirals and another one containing irregulars. Our main findings are:  1. Irregular galaxies show higher values of total infrared luminosity than their spiral counterparts.  2. Infrared excess emission is found to be more prominent in irregular galaxies when compared to that observed in spiral galaxies.  3. Dust temperature distribution shows significant differences among irregular and spiral galaxies."}
{"text":"The aim of this article is to present the basic concepts in Riemannian geometry that are needed for understanding the main results presented here.  The first section introduces some notation and definitions used throughout the text.   In particular we define what it means for two points on an n-dimensional manifold M to be close together (in terms of geodesic distance) or far apart.    We also introduce the concept of a local coordinate system at each point p \u2208 M which allows us to describe any other point q near p by giving its coordinates with respect to these local charts.   Finally we give a brief description of how one can construct such a coordinate system locally around a given point using parallel transport along curves starting at p.    The second section describes the notion of a vector field X defined over all of M.   This is done by defining a map F : T M \u2192 R where T M denotes the tangent bundle of M.   Then we show that if X satisfies certain conditions then there exists a unique smooth function f : M \u2192 R such that X = grad(f).   Here grad(f) denotes the gradient of f.   For example, if M is a surface embedded in R3 then X could represent the velocity of a particle moving across M.   If we assume that the particles move according to Newton's laws of motion then the function f would correspond to the potential energy of the system under consideration.

{"text":"We report on the observation and characterization of two-dimensional defect modes in optically-induced photonic crystals (OIPCs). The OIPC is formed by periodic modulation of refractive index using femtosecond laser pulses focused into fused silica glass. We show that the defect mode can be tuned over a wide range of wavelengths, which are determined by the periodicity of the lattice structure as well as the size of the defects. This work opens up new possibilities for designing optical devices based on these structures. \n \n Photonic crystal slabs have attracted considerable attention recently because they provide an excellent platform to study light-matter interactions at the nanoscale [1] . In particular, it has been shown that three-dimensional photonic crystals with point or line defects exhibit localized states within their bandgap [2] , leading to many interesting applications such as lasers [3] , filters [4] , sensors [5] , nonlinear optics [6] , etc.. However, fabrication of three-dimensional photonic crystals requires sophisticated techniques [7, 8] , making them difficult to integrate with other micro\/nano-structures. Recently, several groups have demonstrated two-dimensional photonic crystals [9] - [11] fabricated directly inside transparent materials via direct laser writing [12] - [14] . These 2D photonic crystals offer advantages including ease of fabrication, flexibility in design, and compatibility with existing technologies [15] .\nIn this Letter we demonstrate the formation of defect modes in opticallyinduced photonic crystals (OPC) [16] . The OPC consists of periodically modulated refractive index created by focusing femtosecond laser pulses into fused silica glass [17] .

{"text":"We propose an efficient numerical scheme to solve the nonlinear dynamics of semiconductor microcavity lasers with arbitrary pumping profiles and cavity losses, which is based on the combination of two different truncation schemes. The first one is used to reduce the number of equations by eliminating all but those that are relevant at any given time instant; this allows us to obtain accurate results even when only few modes contribute significantly to the total emission spectrum. The second one is applied to eliminate the fast oscillating terms appearing due to the presence of multiple longitudinal modes within each transverse mode family. We show how these two techniques can be combined into a single algorithm, which we call \"dynamics-controlled truncation\" (DCT). Finally, we demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of our method by comparing it against other existing methods. In particular, we consider three different types of pumping profiles: constant, periodic, and random pulsed pumping. \nI. INTRODU CTION\nSemiconductor microcavity lasers' attract considerable attention because they provide a promising route towards low-threshold laser sources [1] .

For example, in Ref. [6] , the authors use a reduced set of rate equations to describe the evolution of the slowly varying amplitudes of the dominant modes. This approach has been extended recently to include higher-order effects [7] as well as nonuniform gain saturation [9] . Another possibility consists in using truncated Fourier series expansions [10] , where the coefficients of the expansion are determined self-consistently [11] . Alternatively, one may also employ direct integration of Maxwell's equations [12] , although this requires very large computational resources [13] ."}
{"text":"We present an efficient distributed algorithm for implementing the most common query operations in relational databases, namely selection and projection. The proposed approach is based on the concept of data partitioning which allows us to distribute the workload among different nodes in order to minimize communication costs between them. We show that our method can be used as a building block for more complex queries such as joins or aggregates. Finally we provide experimental results showing how our solution outperforms existing approaches by orders of magnitude when dealing with large datasets. Relational database management systems (RDBMS) are widely used nowadays due to their ability to store and manage huge amounts of information efficiently. However, this efficiency comes at the cost of high computational complexity since all the data has to reside in main memory during processing time. This problem becomes even worse if one wants to perform ad-hoc analysis over very large volumes of data stored in RDBMSs. In fact, it may take hours or days just to answer simple questions like \"Which customers bought product X?\" or \"What products were sold together last year?\". To overcome these limitations, several research efforts have been made recently towards developing new techniques allowing users to access and analyze massive amounts of data without having to load everything into main memory simultaneously. These solutions usually rely on parallel computing frameworks where each node stores only part of the whole dataset while performing local computations independently from other nodes."}

{"text":"We study the non-equilibrium evolution of an interacting onedimensional Bose gas initially prepared in a coherent state with finite particle number fluctuations and show that it exhibits universal features, which are independent of microscopic details such as interactions or initial conditions. We find that the system evolves into a stationary state characterized by non-vanishing density-density correlations at all distances. The time dependence of these correlations is governed by a single parameter, which we identify with the inverse temperature of the final equilibrium state. This allows us to determine this temperature directly from experimental data without any fitting parameters. Our results provide new insights into the nonequilibrium physics of quantum many-body systems and may be tested experimentally using ultracold atoms trapped in optical lattices. \nI. INTRODUCTORY REMARK\nThe recent development of techniques for trapping and manipulating cold atomic gases has opened up exciting possibilities for studying strongly correlated quantum matter far from thermal equilibrium [1] . In particular, experiments have demonstrated how isolated quantum systems can evolve towards their ground states [2] , while being driven out of equilibrium by sudden changes in external control parameters [3] .\nIn this work, we consider the case where the system is suddenly quenched across a phase transition [4] . For example, if the particles were originally confined to a harmonic trap, they would expand freely after switching off the confining potential [5] . Alternatively, the system could be initialized in its ground state [6] before undergoing a rapid change in some other parameter (e.g., magnetic field) [7, 8] . In both cases, the subsequent relaxation process will depend crucially on whether the system was initially prepared close to equilibrium [9] or not [10] . If the latter situation applies, then the system typically relaxes towards a metastable state [11] whose properties cannot be inferred from those of the original equilibrium ensemble [12] ."}
{"text":"We prove that the only actions by groups with Kazhdan's property (T) on Gizatullin surface are trivial, i.e., they are either free or fixed point free.  This is joint work with A. Lando. We also show that there exists an infinite family of non-isomorphic actions of $SL(2,R)$ on Gizatullin threefolds which have no global fixed points but do not admit any equivariant complex structure. These results were announced in our preprint [BL] . \nIntroduction\n\nLet $X$ be a smooth projective variety over $\\mathbb{C}$ equipped with an action of a group $G$ such that the induced map $G\\times X\\to X$ is holomorphic. The action is called algebraic if it lifts to an action of some connected reductive algebraic group $H$ defined over $\\mathbb{Q}$. In this case we say that $X$ admits an $H$-structure. \nThe main goal of this note is to study algebraic actions of groups with Kazhdan\u2019s property (T). Recall that a locally compact topological group has Kazhdan\u2019s property T if every unitary representation of $G$ which does not contain almost invariant vectors is finite dimensional. Examples include all simple Lie groups without center and many other interesting classes of groups including lattices in higher rank semisimple Lie groups. \n\nKazhdan\u2019s property T was introduced by M. Gromov [Gro81] who used it to establish rigidity properties for Riemannian manifolds with negative sectional curvature.

Serre [S89] , D. Toledo [T92] ,  S. Adams [A94]  and others.   \nIn particular, property T plays crucial role in classification problems related to algebraic actions.

{"text":"The vicinal Si(111) surface is the most studied example for reconstructed semiconductor surfaces, and it has been shown that its structure can be described by a periodic array of steps with different heights. The main goal of this work was to study how these steps evolve into facets when they are submitted to an external stress field produced by a miscut angle between 0\u00b0 and 2\u00b0. We have used scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), low energy electron diffraction (LEED), reflection high energy electron diffraction (RHEED), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and molecular dynamics simulations in order to understand the evolution of the stepped surface towards a more ordered one. Our results show that at small angles there exists only one type of terrace widths which correspond to the equilibrium value predicted by Wulff's construction. At larger angles we observe two types of terraces whose widths depend on their position along the direction perpendicular to the steps. Finally, at large enough angles, the system evolves toward a flat surface where all the terraces present similar dimensions."}
{"text":"We present an algorithm for consistent hypothesis testing in which we consider all possible hypotheses that are compatible with some given set of observations, and select those that maximize their posterior probability according to Bayes' theorem.  We show how this can be done efficiently by using dynamic programming techniques. The resulting algorithm is optimal up to constant factors under certain conditions. Our approach also allows us to reason consistently over multiple experiments performed sequentially or simultaneously. This problem has been studied extensively in statistics but only recently in artificial intelligence (AI). In AI it was first considered as part of the PAC learning framework where one seeks algorithms that learn concepts from examples while making few mistakes. However, these approaches do not provide any guarantees when there exists more than one concept that fits the data equally well. In contrast our method provides provable guarantees even if several hypotheses fit the data equally well. Finally, we demonstrate the practicality of our approach through two applications:  1) A new algorithm for finding explanations in probabilistic databases; 2) An improved algorithm for identifying protein families based on sequence alignment."}
{"text":"We present new near-infrared observations of the edge-on spiral galaxy NGC 891, obtained with VLT\/VISIR and Gemini\/NIRI at wavelengths between 8 and 13 microns (rest-frame). We detect an extended emission feature that is perpendicular to the galactic disk and extends up to 3 kpc into the halo. The morphology suggests that this structure consists of two components: one located close to the midplane and another one located about 1.5 kpc higher than it. This second component has a temperature of T = 120 K \u00b1 20 K and shows no evidence for significant extinction by dust grains along its line-of-sight. Its luminosity corresponds to a star formation rate of 0.1 M\u2299 yr\u22121.

We show that these effects can be significant in some cases, especially when considering schemes where the electron bunch is short compared with the wavelength (e.g., self-amplified spontaneous emission). The results are used to assess the impact of this effect on two proposed schemes at LCLS-II. In one scheme, we consider using a tapered wiggler as part of a chicane-based compressor system; in another case, we examine the use of a magnetic chicago-bars section following the undulator. For both cases, we find that the inclusion of realistic impedance and wakefields leads to modest changes in the predicted performance. \n \n Keywords: Undulator, Wakefield, Impedance, Self-Amplified Spontaneous Emission"}

{"text":"We study the dynamics of carrier-carrier interactions in semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) by solving numerically the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation for two interacting electrons or holes confined to an anisotropic QD potential well. We find that, depending on the initial state, there are three different regimes of interaction between carriers which can be classified as weak coupling regime with no significant energy exchange; strong coupling regime where one electron is excited into higher states while another remains in its ground state; and finally, intermediate regime where both carriers undergo transitions simultaneously but at slightly different frequencies. In addition we show how these results depend on the dot shape and size parameters. Finally, we discuss possible applications of our findings such as generation of entangled photon pairs via biexciton decay. Quantum dots have been studied extensively over past decade due to their unique optical properties [1] . The most important feature of QDs is the possibility of controlling their emission wavelength through variation of their size [2] , allowing them to operate within a wide range of wavelengths [3] .\nIn this work we focus on studying the effects of carrier-carrier interactions [4] in semiconductor QDs using numerical solution of timedependent Schr\u00f6dinger equations [5] . Carriers interact strongly when they occupy neighboring single-particle levels [6] leading to formation of bound excitonic complexes [7, 8] . However, if carriers occupy distant single particle levels then their mutual Coulomb attraction leads to formation of virtual excitons [9] . These virtual excitons may either recombine radiatively [10] or non-radiatively [11] giving rise to Auger processes [12] . On the other hand, if carriers occupy adjacent single particle levels then their interaction becomes so strong that it cannot be treated perturbatively anymore [13] . This situation occurs e.g., during relaxation of photoexcited carriers [14] or in presence of external electric field [15] ."}

The mass spectrum, decay widths and branching ratios are calculated for all possible transitions among  $\\Upsilon(3S), \\Upsilon(2S),$ and $ \\Upsilon(1S)$ states. It has been found that the results obtained by us agree well with experimental data.  In particular, we have predicted some new decay channels which can be tested experimentally. We also predict the existence of two new excited states at about 3 MeV above the ground state. These predictions may provide useful information to search for these exotic states. Finally, we give our conclusions. Introduction: Recently there were many theoretical studies on the lightest member of the nonet of scalar mesons, i.e., the $\\Upsilon$-meson system [1] . This interest was stimulated mainly due to the fact that this meson is considered as an ideal testing ground for studying various aspects of QCD such as confinement mechanism [2] , spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking [3] , gluonic excitations [4] etc.. On the other hand, it is known that the $\\Upsilon$-system contains several interesting features like mixing between singlet and octet components [5] , strong coupling to vector mesons [6] , large Nc expansion [7] , etc..\nIn order to understand better the nature of the $\\Upsilon$-state, it would be very important to know its properties more precisely. However, up to now only few experiments [8] - [10] have been done to measure the masses and partial widths of the $\\Upsilon$scalar mesons. Therefore, further investigations both theoretically and experimentally should be carried out to get more precise values of their physical quantities."}

We show that such congruences are determined by a pair of real valued functions $(f_1, f_2)$ on the unit sphere $S^2$ satisfying certain conditions which we call the shear-free condition. The first function $f_1$ is called the optical scalar function while the second one $f_2$ is called the twist potential. In this setting, we define the complex valued CR-function associated to any given regular shear-free null-geodesic congruence as follows: \n$$F = F_1 + iF_2 = \\frac{1}{2}(f_1 - if_2),$$ where $F_i$'s are the components of $F$ along the two principal null directions of the congruence. Then we prove that for every regular shear-free nullgeodesic congruence there exists an unique upto constant multiple CR-function. Finally, using the above results, we give a new proof of the flat-space Maxwell equations."}

We have discovered one such object which we call JW 380. It is an eclipsing binary system consisting of two very similar stars that are separated by only 1 AU. The primary star has a mass of about 0.25 Msun while its companion has a mass of about 15 percent less. Both components show signs of youth as indicated by their strong H-alpha emission lines. Their age was determined using theoretical evolutionary tracks for PMS stars. Our results suggest that this system is younger than 2 Myr old. This makes it one of the youngest known binaries among all open clusters within 300 pc distance from Earth. In addition, we find evidence that both components are surrounded by circumstellar disks."}
{"text":"We present an algorithm for the detection and characterization of unique molecular events in time series data, which is based on identifying all possible pairs of states that can be reached by following different paths through the state space. The method was applied to simulated as well as experimental single-molecule FRET traces recorded during DNA replication at high temporal resolution (10 ms). We show how this approach allows us to detect and characterize rare but important transitions between distinct conformational states of the replisome machinery. In particular we identify a previously unknown transition mechanism where the helicase switches its directionality while still bound to the fork junction. This new insight into the dynamics of the replisome will help to understand how it operates under physiological conditions. \n \n Introduction \n \n Single molecule experiments have become increasingly popular over recent years because they allow one to study processes such as protein folding or enzymatic reactions with unprecedented detail1-5 . However, extracting information about these complex systems often requires advanced analysis techniques6-8 , especially when dealing with noisy data9-11 . Here we introduce a novel computational framework for analyzing time-series data obtained from single molecule experiments12-15 . Our approach relies on detecting all possible pairs of states within a given trajectory that are connected via alternative pathways16-18 . These so-called \"state pairs\" represent unique molecular events19-21 that occur rarely22-24 but may play crucial roles in determining system behavior25-27 .\n \n State Pair Analysis\n\nThe basic idea behind our approach is illustrated in Figure 1 . Consider a hypothetical example consisting of three consecutive states s1, s2, s3 along a single trajectory. If there exists another pathway connecting s2 and s3 than the one shown here, then both states belong to the same state pair. Note that each state has several outgoing edges corresponding to multiple possible transitions out of that state. For instance, if the system starts in state s1, it could either stay in s1 or move directly to s2 after some delay. Similarly, starting in s2 would lead to either staying in s2 or moving to s3 immediately afterwards. Finally, starting in s3 would always result in returning back to s1. As a consequence, any"}
{"text":"We present here the predictions for the decay rates and CP asymmetries in B decays into two vector mesons, based on the assumption that there is no direct coupling between quarks and leptons at low energies.  We show how this hypothesis leads to relations among different observables which are not predicted by the Standard Model (SM). These relations can be tested experimentally with high precision using data collected at LHCb or Belle II experiments. \nThe results presented here have been obtained within an effective field theory framework where we assume that all new physics effects appear only through higher dimensional operators suppressed by inverse powers of some large scale M . The leading order contributions to these operators come from integrating out heavy degrees of freedom such as W , Z bosons and top quark. In our analysis we consider both tree-level and loop-induced processes. Our main focus has been put on the study of rare B decays involving one photon and one lepton pair in the final state."}

{"text":"We present new deep photometry for the remote open cluster B514, located at about 1 degree (0.5 kpc) south-east of the center of the Andromeda galaxy (M31). The data were obtained with the Wide Field Camera 3 on board HST and cover an area of 0.6 square degrees centered around the cluster position. We detect more than 100 candidate members brighter than V = 25 mag within a radius of 2 arcmin from the cluster center. These are likely to be associated with the cluster itself rather than background galaxies or foreground Galactic dwarfs because they have colors consistent with those expected for old red giant branch stars. In addition we find that there is a significant number of faint blue objects surrounding the cluster which may belong to it as well. Using these candidates together with previous ground-based observations we construct color-magnitude diagrams for different annuli extending out to 5 arcmin from the cluster centre. From this analysis we conclude that the cluster has an extended halo containing several hundred low mass stars beyond its tidal radius."}

We show how to use these motifs as building blocks for generating synthetic networks whose properties closely match those of their natural counterparts. Finally, we demonstrate how this approach can be used to study the evolution of biological networks by comparing two versions of the same metabolic pathway taken from different species. In recent years there has been an explosion in interest in studying large collections of interacting entities known as complex networks. These include social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn; information networks like the World Wide Web (WWW); communication networks such as phone calls; transportation networks including roadways and railways; and many others. A common feature shared among all of these systems is that they consist of nodes connected together via links. For example, in a social network each node represents an individual user while edges represent friendships between users. Similarly, in a WWW graph web pages correspond to nodes and hyperlinks connect them. Despite the diversity of applications, most studies have focused on characterizing global topological features of these networks using statistical measures such as average path length, clustering coefficient, assortativity coefficients, etc., see e.g. \n \n However, it turns out that even though these statistics provide useful insights into large-scale structural patterns observed across diverse classes of networks, they fail to capture important local structures present within specific types of networks.

The resulting opacities are used as input into radiative-convective equilibrium models that we compare against observations of T dwarf stars. Our calculated opacities agree well with previous work over most wavelengths but disagree significantly near 1 micron where our opacities are lower than those found by other authors. This discrepancy is likely due to differences between how atomic data were obtained; however, further investigation will be necessary before this issue can be resolved conclusively. \n \n In addition to calculating opacities for pure hydrogen\/helium atmospheres, we also consider mixed compositions containing up to 50% water vapor or ammonia.

{"text":"We propose to connect the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) with an International Linear Collider (ILC), which will be built in Japan or Korea, by using quintessence as dark energy.  We show that this connection is possible if we assume that the universe has been expanding at a constant rate for about 10 billion years since its birth. The expansion speed of the universe can then be determined by measuring the time delay between signals emitted simultaneously from distant galaxies observed today and those emitted from them when they were closer together during their youthful days. This measurement would provide us with information on how much dark energy there was back then. If our proposal turns out to be correct, it may lead to new insights into the nature of dark energy. In addition, it could also shed light on why the universe looks so different now than what it looked like just after its birth. It might even help explain why the universe appears to have evolved in such a way that life forms are able to exist here on Earth."}
{"text":"We present the first dynamical mass measurement for an eclipsing binary system with one component that is still on its pre-main sequence (PMS). The PMS star, V773 Tau A, has been observed to undergo large-amplitude photometric variability and spectroscopic changes indicative of rapid rotation and magnetic activity. We have obtained new high-precision radial velocity measurements using the HIRES spectrograph at Keck Observatory in Hawaii.

Using this orbit we calculate a dynamical mass for V773 Tau A of 0.84 \u00b1 0.04M\u2299. This value agrees well with theoretical predictions based upon evolutionary models for young stars. Our results provide strong evidence against previous claims that the components of close binaries evolve independently during their early stages of formation.

In these models we find that there are characteristic deviations from general relativity which lead to measurable differences between the observed gravitational waveform and those predicted within Einstein's theory. \n \n The detection of such deviations would provide strong evidence for new physics beyond standard model expectations. This could have important consequences on our understanding of fundamental interactions at high energies.

{"text":"We present here a detailed discussion on the concept of allovalency, which is defined as the simultaneous binding to multiple sites in one molecule by different ligands (or receptors). We show that this definition does not apply to many cases where it has been used previously. In particular we discuss how multisite phosphorylation can be described within our formalism without introducing any new concepts or parameters beyond those already introduced for single-site phosphorylation. Finally, we argue why rebinding effects are negligible under most conditions relevant for signaling cascades. The concept of \"allovalency\" was first introduced more than 20 years ago [1] . It refers to the simultaneous binding of two or more ligands to several sites in one receptor protein [2] , see Fig 1(A) . This phenomenon occurs frequently during signal transduction processes such as kinase cascades [3] .\nThe term \"allovalent\" was coined because it describes a situation intermediate between monovalent and multivalent interactions [4] : while each ligand binds only once per receptor, there may exist several copies of the same ligand bound simultaneously to the same receptor. Allovalent interactions have been studied extensively both experimentally [5] and theoretically [6] . However, despite its widespread use, the precise meaning of \"allovalency\" remains ambiguous [7, 8] . For example, some authors define allovalency as \"the simultaneous interaction with multiple sites in one molecule via different molecules\" [9] . Others consider allovalency to occur when \"ligand molecules bind independently but cooperatively to multiple sites in one receptor molecule\" [10] . Yet others require that \"allovalent complexes must contain at least three components\" [11] ."}

In particular we find that the value of the gap depends only on the number of particles involved in the process and does not depend explicitly on temperature or any other physical parameter. This result agrees well with experimental data obtained recently at high temperatures. \nThe new interpretation presented here also sheds light into some puzzling results found in recent experiments performed on cuprate compounds which have been widely studied because they exhibit very high critical temperatures. The most important feature of these materials is the existence of two different gaps in the excitation spectrum corresponding to electron-like quasiparticles and hole-like excitations respectively."}
{"text":"We present an approximate theory to study the effect of a magnetic field on the ground state properties and phase diagram of strongly correlated systems, such as high-Tc cuprates or heavy fermion compounds. The starting point is the exact diagonalization (ED) of small clusters with periodic boundary conditions at zero temperature. We use Lanczos ED method to calculate the energy spectrum of these clusters. Then we construct a variational wave function by projecting this cluster eigenstates onto a set of single-particle orbitals obtained within density functional theory (DFT). This allows us to obtain accurate results even when using only very few DFT states per orbital. Finally, we perform Monte Carlo simulations based on the Gutzwiller projected BCS wave functions to investigate the thermodynamic behavior of our system. Our main result shows that the application of a magnetic field leads to a suppression of the superfluid order parameter $\\psi$ which can be understood as a consequence of the Zeeman splitting between spin-up and -down electrons."}
{"text":"We present an analysis combining weak lensing tomography and halo clustering measurements in order to probe the nature of dark energy. We use a sample of galaxy clusters selected by their Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (SZE) signal, which is detected via its inverse Compton scattering off cosmic microwave background photons. The cluster masses are determined using X-ray data obtained from Chandra observations. Using this mass calibration we measure the projected correlation function between these clusters as well as the cross-correlation functions between them and galaxies at different redshifts. These measurements allow us to determine cosmological parameters such as the equation-of-state parameter w0 and the matter density $\\Omega_m$. Our results show that our method can be used to constrain both parameters simultaneously with high precision. In particular, we find that for a flat universe with $\\Omega_m = 0.3$ and assuming a constant value of $w_0$, we obtain $\\sigma(w_0) \\approx 0.05$ and $\\sigma(\\Omega_m) \\approx 0.01$."}
{"text":"We study the cosmology of modified gravity models with an action that contains higher-order curvature terms, such as $R^2$ and $R_{\\mu \\nu \\rho \\sigma}$. We show how to derive constraints on these theories using observations of large-scale structure (LSS), cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB), supernovae Ia (SNeIa), baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), Hubble constant measurements (HST), and gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). In particular we consider two classes of models: those in which the gravitational field equations are fourth order in derivatives; and those where they are second order but contain extra degrees of freedom beyond the usual massless graviton. For both cases we find that current data is consistent with general relativity at the level of one part in 10^6 or better. However, future experiments may be able to detect deviations from GR if they exist. \n \n Keywords: Modified Gravity"}
{"text":"The parity violating asymmetry in the scattering of polarized electrons off unpolarized protons is measured at Jefferson Lab to determine the proton's weak charge with an uncertainty comparable to that achieved for the electron and neutron.  The experiment uses longitudinally polarized electrons produced by CEBAF, which are scattered off a liquid hydrogen target located inside Hall A. The data were taken during two experimental runs between October 2009 and May 2011 using beam currents ranging from 0.5 nA to 1.0 \u00b5A. This measurement improves upon previous results obtained at SLAC (1998) and JLab (2005), where systematic uncertainties dominated over statistical ones. In this analysis we have reduced these systematics significantly through improved understanding of the detector response as well as new techniques used to extract the signal. We find Qweak = -0.0018 \u00b1 0.0007(stat.) \u00b1 0.0003(syst.), consistent with Standard Model predictions within one standard deviation."}
{"text":"The multifractal nature of the human heartbeat has been studied by many authors, but most studies have focused on short time series (typically less than one hour). In this work we study the scaling properties of long-term recordings of the electrocardiograms (ECG) of healthy subjects during sleep using wavelet transforms to calculate the singularity spectrum f(\u03b1), which characterizes the degree of multifractality present in each signal.  We find that all signals are characterized by a broad range of exponents \u03b1 indicating strong multifractality. The width \u0394\u03b1 of these spectra decreases with increasing recording length T as \u0394\u03b1~T-1\/2 for T<10 hours and \u0394\u03b1~T-3\/4 for T>10 hours. This indicates that the ECGs become more monofractal-like when longer recordings are considered. Finally, we show how our results can be used to detect pathological changes in the heart rate variability associated with congestive heart failure."}
{"text":"We give an explicit description of the higher algebraic K-groups in terms of certain universal cohomology classes, which are defined by using only the ring structure and the unit element of the underlying commutative ring. This is done for any commutative ring with unity R (not necessarily Noetherian). The main result can be formulated as follows: Let M be a module over R. Then there exists a natural isomorphism between the higher algebraic K-groups: \nK_n(R) = Ext^n_R(M, R)\nand the group of all n-fold Massey products on M modulo those that vanish under some suitable finiteness condition. We also show how this theorem leads to a new proof of Quillen's localization theorem. Finally we discuss applications to the study of equivariant K-theory. In particular, we prove that if G is a compact Lie group acting freely on a smooth manifold X then the equivariant K-theory groups of X are isomorphic to the ordinary K-theory groups of the fixed point set X^G."}
