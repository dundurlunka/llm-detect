{"text":"  A rather non-standard quantum representation of the canonical commutation\nrelations of quantum mechanics systems, known as the polymer representation has\ngained some attention in recent years, due to its possible relation with Planck\nscale physics. In particular, this approach has been followed in a symmetric\nsector of loop quantum gravity known as loop quantum cosmology. Here we explore\ndifferent aspects of the relation between the ordinary Schroedinger theory and\nthe polymer description. The paper has two parts. In the first one, we derive\nthe polymer quantum mechanics starting from the ordinary Schroedinger theory\nand show that the polymer description arises as an appropriate limit. In the\nsecond part we consider the continuum limit of this theory, namely, the reverse\nprocess in which one starts from the discrete theory and tries to recover back\nthe ordinary Schroedinger quantum mechanics. We consider several examples of\ninterest, including the harmonic oscillator, the free particle and a simple\ncosmological model.\n"}
{"text":"  We discuss the results from the combined IRAC and MIPS c2d Spitzer Legacy\nobservations of the Serpens star-forming region. In particular we present a set\nof criteria for isolating bona fide young stellar objects, YSO's, from the\nextensive background contamination by extra-galactic objects. We then discuss\nthe properties of the resulting high confidence set of YSO's. We find 235 such\nobjects in the 0.85 deg^2 field that was covered with both IRAC and MIPS. An\nadditional set of 51 lower confidence YSO's outside this area is identified\nfrom the MIPS data combined with 2MASS photometry. We describe two sets of\nresults, color-color diagrams to compare our observed source properties with\nthose of theoretical models for star\/disk\/envelope systems and our own modeling\nof the subset of our objects that appear to be star+disks. These objects\nexhibit a very wide range of disk properties, from many that can be fit with\nactively accreting disks to some with both passive disks and even possibly\ndebris disks. We find that the luminosity function of YSO's in Serpens extends\ndown to at least a few x .001 Lsun or lower for an assumed distance of 260 pc.\nThe lower limit may be set by our inability to distinguish YSO's from\nextra-galactic sources more than by the lack of YSO's at very low luminosities.\nA spatial clustering analysis shows that the nominally less-evolved YSO's are\nmore highly clustered than the later stages and that the background\nextra-galactic population can be fit by the same two-point correlation function\nas seen in other extra-galactic studies. We also present a table of matches\nbetween several previous infrared and X-ray studies of the Serpens YSO\npopulation and our Spitzer data set.\n"}
{"text":"  Results from spectroscopic observations of the Intermediate Polar (IP) EX Hya\nin quiescence during 1991 and 2001 are presented. Spin-modulated radial\nvelocities consistent with an outer disc origin were detected for the first\ntime in an IP. The spin pulsation was modulated with velocities near ~500-600\nkm\/s. These velocities are consistent with those of material circulating at the\nouter edge of the accretion disc, suggesting corotation of the accretion\ncurtain with material near the Roche lobe radius. Furthermore, spin Doppler\ntomograms have revealed evidence of the accretion curtain emission extending\nfrom velocities of ~500 km\/s to ~1000 km\/s. These findings have confirmed the\ntheoretical model predictions of King & Wynn (1999), Belle et al. (2002) and\nNorton et al. (2004) for EX Hya, which predict large accretion curtains that\nextend to a distance close to the Roche lobe radius in this system. Evidence\nfor overflow stream of material falling onto the magnetosphere was observed,\nconfirming the result of Belle et al. (2005) that disc overflow in EX Hya is\npresent during quiescence as well as outburst. It appears that the hbeta and\nhgamma spin radial velocities originated from the rotation of the funnel at the\nouter disc edge, while those of halpha were produced due to the flow of\nmaterial along the field lines far from the white dwarf (narrow component) and\nclose to the white dwarf (broad-base component), in agreement with the\naccretion curtain model.\n"}
{"text":"  We present Lie group integrators for nonlinear stochastic differential\nequations with non-commutative vector fields whose solution evolves on a smooth\nfinite dimensional manifold. Given a Lie group action that generates transport\nalong the manifold, we pull back the stochastic flow on the manifold to the Lie\ngroup via the action, and subsequently pull back the flow to the corresponding\nLie algebra via the exponential map. We construct an approximation to the\nstochastic flow in the Lie algebra via closed operations and then push back to\nthe Lie group and then to the manifold, thus ensuring our approximation lies in\nthe manifold. We call such schemes stochastic Munthe-Kaas methods after their\ndeterministic counterparts. We also present stochastic Lie group integration\nschemes based on Castell--Gaines methods. These involve using an underlying\nordinary differential integrator to approximate the flow generated by a\ntruncated stochastic exponential Lie series. They become stochastic Lie group\nintegrator schemes if we use Munthe-Kaas methods as the underlying ordinary\ndifferential integrator. Further, we show that some Castell--Gaines methods are\nuniformly more accurate than the corresponding stochastic Taylor schemes.\nLastly we demonstrate our methods by simulating the dynamics of a free rigid\nbody such as a satellite and an autonomous underwater vehicle both perturbed by\ntwo independent multiplicative stochastic noise processes.\n"}
{"text":"  The very nature of the solar chromosphere, its structuring and dynamics,\nremains far from being properly understood, in spite of intensive research.\nHere we point out the potential of chromospheric observations at millimeter\nwavelengths to resolve this long-standing problem. Computations carried out\nwith a sophisticated dynamic model of the solar chromosphere due to Carlsson\nand Stein demonstrate that millimeter emission is extremely sensitive to\ndynamic processes in the chromosphere and the appropriate wavelengths to look\nfor dynamic signatures are in the range 0.8-5.0 mm. The model also suggests\nthat high resolution observations at mm wavelengths, as will be provided by\nALMA, will have the unique property of reacting to both the hot and the cool\ngas, and thus will have the potential of distinguishing between rival models of\nthe solar atmosphere. Thus, initial results obtained from the observations of\nthe quiet Sun at 3.5 mm with the BIMA array (resolution of 12 arcsec) reveal\nsignificant oscillations with amplitudes of 50-150 K and frequencies of 1.5-8\nmHz with a tendency toward short-period oscillations in internetwork and longer\nperiods in network regions. However higher spatial resolution, such as that\nprovided by ALMA, is required for a clean separation between the features\nwithin the solar atmosphere and for an adequate comparison with the output of\nthe comprehensive dynamic simulations.\n"}
{"text":"  We analyze the possibility of probing non-standard neutrino interactions\n(NSI, for short) through the detection of neutrinos produced in a future\ngalactic supernova (SN).We consider the effect of NSI on the neutrino\npropagation through the SN envelope within a three-neutrino framework, paying\nspecial attention to the inclusion of NSI-induced resonant conversions, which\nmay take place in the most deleptonised inner layers. We study the possibility\nof detecting NSI effects in a Megaton water Cherenkov detector, either through\nmodulation effects in the $\\bar\\nu_e$ spectrum due to (i) the passage of shock\nwaves through the SN envelope, (ii) the time dependence of the electron\nfraction and (iii) the Earth matter effects; or, finally, through the possible\ndetectability of the neutronization $\\nu_e$ burst. We find that the $\\bar\\nu_e$\nspectrum can exhibit dramatic features due to the internal NSI-induced resonant\nconversion.

{"text":"  The multisite phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle is a motif repeatedly\nused in cell signaling.

{"text":"  We formulate a quantum generalization of the notion of the group of\nRiemannian isometries for a compact Riemannian manifold, by introducing a\nnatural notion of smooth and isometric action by a compact quantum group on a\nclassical or noncommutative manifold described by spectral triples, and then\nproving the existence of a universal object (called the quantum isometry group)\nin the category of compact quantum groups acting smoothly and isometrically on\na given (possibly noncommutative) manifold satisfying certain regularity\nassumptions.

{"text":"  We construct a system of nonequilibrium entropy limiters for the lattice\nBoltzmann methods (LBM). These limiters erase spurious oscillations without\nblurring of shocks, and do not affect smooth solutions. In general, they do the\nsame work for LBM as flux limiters do for finite differences, finite volumes\nand finite elements methods, but for LBM the main idea behind the construction\nof nonequilibrium entropy limiter schemes is to transform a field of a scalar\nquantity - nonequilibrium entropy. There are two families of limiters: (i)\nbased on restriction of nonequilibrium entropy (entropy \"trimming\") and (ii)\nbased on filtering of nonequilibrium entropy (entropy filtering). The physical\nproperties of LBM provide some additional benefits: the control of entropy\nproduction and accurate estimate of introduced artificial dissipation are\npossible. The constructed limiters are tested on classical numerical examples:\n1D athermal shock tubes with an initial density ratio 1:2 and the 2D lid-driven\ncavity for Reynolds numbers Re between 2000 and 7500 on a coarse 100*100 grid.\nAll limiter constructions are applicable for both entropic and non-entropic\nquasiequilibria.\n"}
{"text":"  We present a theoretical framework for plasma turbulence in astrophysical\nplasmas (solar wind, interstellar medium, galaxy clusters, accretion disks).\nThe key assumptions are that the turbulence is anisotropic with respect to the\nmean magnetic field and frequencies are low compared to the ion cyclotron\nfrequency. The energy injected at the outer scale scale has to be converted\ninto heat, which ultimately cannot be done without collisions. A KINETIC\nCASCADE develops that brings the energy to collisional scales both in space and\nvelocity. Its nature depends on the physics of plasma fluctuations. In each of\nthe physically distinct scale ranges, the kinetic problem is systematically\nreduced to a more tractable set of equations. In the \"inertial range\" above the\nion gyroscale, the kinetic cascade splits into a cascade of Alfvenic\nfluctuations, which are governed by the RMHD equations at both the collisional\nand collisionless scales, and a passive cascade of compressive fluctuations,\nwhich obey a linear kinetic equation along the moving field lines associated\nwith the Alfvenic component. In the \"dissipation range\" between the ion and\nelectron gyroscales, there are again two cascades: the kinetic-Alfven-wave\n(KAW) cascade governed by two fluid-like Electron RMHD equations and a passive\nphase-space cascade of ion entropy fluctuations. The latter cascade brings the\nenergy of the inertial-range fluctuations that was damped by collisionless\nwave-particle interaction at the ion gyroscale to collisional scales in the\nphase space and leads to ion heating. The KAW energy is similarly damped at the\nelectron gyroscale and converted into electron heat. Kolmogorov-style scaling\nrelations are derived for these cascades. Astrophysical and space-physical\napplications are discussed in detail.\n"}
{"text":"  This paper considers the propagation of shallow-water solitary and nonlinear\nperiodic waves over a gradual slope with bottom friction in the framework of a\nvariable-coefficient Korteweg-de Vries equation. We use the Whitham averaging\nmethod, using a recent development of this theory for perturbed integrable\nequations. This general approach enables us not only to improve known results\non the adiabatic evolution of isolated solitary waves and periodic wave trains\nin the presence of variable topography and bottom friction, modeled by the\nChezy law, but also importantly, to study the effects of these factors on the\npropagation of undular bores, which are essentially unsteady in the system\nunder consideration. In particular, it is shown that the combined action of\nvariable topography and bottom friction generally imposes certain global\nrestrictions on the undular bore propagation so that the evolution of the\nleading solitary wave can be substantially different from that of an isolated\nsolitary wave with the same initial amplitude. This non-local effect is due to\nnonlinear wave interactions within the undular bore and can lead to an\nadditional solitary wave amplitude growth, which cannot be predicted in the\nframework of the traditional adiabatic approach to the propagation of solitary\nwaves in slowly varying media.\n"}

The intelligent locator comprises\na sensor antenna and a general regression neural network, which solves the\nlocation problem based on learning from examples. Locator performance was\ntested on different test specimens. Tests have shown that the accuracy of\nlocation depends on sound velocity and attenuation in the specimen, the\ndimensions of the tested area, and the properties of stored data. The location\naccuracy achieved by the intelligent locator is comparable to that obtained by\nthe conventional triangulation method, while the applicability of the\nintelligent locator is more general since analysis of sonic ray paths is\navoided.

{"text":"  We derive masses and radii for both components in the single-lined eclipsing\nbinary HAT-TR-205-013, which consists of a F7V primary and a late M-dwarf\nsecondary.

We demonstrate\ngenerally that the surface gravity of the secondary star in a single-lined\nbinary undergoing total eclipses can be derived from characteristics of the\nlight curve and spectroscopic orbit. This constrains the secondary to a unique\nline in the mass-radius diagram with $M\/R^2$ = constant. For HAT-TR-205-013, we\nassume the orbit has been tidally circularized, and that the primary's rotation\nhas been synchronized and aligned with the orbital axis. Our observed line\nbroadening, $V_{\\rm rot} \\sin i_{\\rm rot} = 28.9 \\pm 1.0$ \\kms, gives a primary\nradius of $R_{\\rm A} = 1.28 \\pm 0.04$ \\rsun. Our light curve analysis leads to\nthe radius of the secondary, $R_{\\rm B} = 0.167 \\pm 0.006$ \\rsun, and the\nsemimajor axis of the orbit, $a = 7.54 \\pm 0.30 \\rsun = 0.0351 \\pm 0.0014$ AU.\nOur single-lined spectroscopic orbit and the semimajor axis then yield the\nindividual masses, $M_{\\rm B} = 0.124 \\pm 0.010$ \\msun and $M_{\\rm A} = 1.04\n\\pm 0.13$ \\msun.

{"text":"  Possible (algebraic) commutation relations in the Lagrangian quantum theory\nof free (scalar, spinor and vector) fields are considered from mathematical\nview-point.

The paracommutation relations or some their\ngeneralizations are pointed as the most general ones that entail the validity\nof all Heisenberg equations. The simultaneous fulfillment of the Heisenberg\nequations and the uniqueness requirement turn to be impossible. This problem is\nsolved via a redefinition of the dynamical variables, similar to the normal\nordering procedure and containing it as a special case. That implies\ncorresponding changes in the admissible commutation relations. The introduction\nof the concept of the vacuum makes narrow the class of the possible commutation\nrelations; in particular, the mentioned redefinition of the dynamical variables\nis reduced to normal ordering. As a last restriction on that class is imposed\nthe requirement for existing of an effective procedure for calculating vacuum\nmean values.

{"text":"  Epitaxial self-assembled quantum dots (SAQDs) are of interest for\nnanostructured optoelectronic and electronic devices such as lasers,\nphotodetectors and nanoscale logic. Spatial order and size order of SAQDs are\nimportant to the development of usable devices. It is likely that these two\ntypes of order are strongly linked; thus, a study of spatial order will also\nhave strong implications for size order. Here a study of spatial order is\nundertaken using a linear analysis of a commonly used model of SAQD formation\nbased on surface diffusion. Analytic formulas for film-height correlation\nfunctions are found that characterize quantum dot spatial order and\ncorresponding correlation lengths that quantify order. Initial atomic-scale\nrandom fluctuations result in relatively small correlation lengths (about two\ndots) when the effect of a wetting potential is negligible; however, the\ncorrelation lengths diverge when SAQDs are allowed to form at a near-critical\nfilm height. The present work reinforces previous findings about anisotropy and\nSAQD order and presents as explicit and transparent mechanism for ordering with\ncorresponding analytic equations.

{"text":"  The goal of this paper is to construct invariant dynamical objects for a (not\nnecessarily invertible) smooth self map of a compact manifold. We prove a\nresult that takes advantage of differences in rates of expansion in the terms\nof a sheaf cohomological long exact sequence to create unique lifts of finite\ndimensional invariant subspaces of one term of the sequence to invariant\nsubspaces of the preceding term. This allows us to take invariant cohomological\nclasses and under the right circumstances construct unique currents of a given\ntype, including unique measures of a given type, that represent those classes\nand are invariant under pullback. A dynamically interesting self map may have a\nplethora of invariant measures, so the uniquess of the constructed currents is\nimportant. It means that if local growth is not too big compared to the growth\nrate of the cohomological class then the expanding cohomological class gives\nsufficient \"marching orders\" to the system to prohibit the formation of any\nother such invariant current of the same type (say from some local dynamical\nsubsystem). Because we use subsheaves of the sheaf of currents we give\nconditions under which a subsheaf will have the same cohomology as the sheaf\ncontaining it. Using a smoothing argument this allows us to show that the sheaf\ncohomology of the currents under consideration can be canonically identified\nwith the deRham cohomology groups.

{"text":"  We show that the globular cluster mass function (GCMF) in the Milky Way\ndepends on cluster half-mass density (rho_h) in the sense that the turnover\nmass M_TO increases with rho_h while the width of the GCMF decreases. We argue\nthat this is the expected signature of the slow erosion of a mass function that\ninitially rose towards low masses, predominantly through cluster evaporation\ndriven by internal two-body relaxation. We find excellent agreement between the\nobserved GCMF -- including its dependence on internal density rho_h, central\nconcentration c, and Galactocentric distance r_gc -- and a simple model in\nwhich the relaxation-driven mass-loss rates of clusters are approximated by\n-dM\/dt = mu_ev ~ rho_h^{1\/2}. In particular, we recover the well-known\ninsensitivity of M_TO to r_gc. This feature does not derive from a literal\n``universality'' of the GCMF turnover mass, but rather from a significant\nvariation of M_TO with rho_h -- the expected outcome of relaxation-driven\ncluster disruption -- plus significant scatter in rho_h as a function of r_gc.\nOur conclusions are the same if the evaporation rates are assumed to depend\ninstead on the mean volume or surface densities of clusters inside their tidal\nradii, as mu_ev ~ rho_t^{1\/2} or mu_ev ~ Sigma_t^{3\/4} -- alternative\nprescriptions that are physically motivated but involve cluster properties\n(rho_t and Sigma_t) that are not as well defined or as readily observable as\nrho_h. In all cases, the normalization of mu_ev required to fit the GCMF\nimplies cluster lifetimes that are within the range of standard values\n(although falling towards the low end of this range). Our analysis does not\ndepend on any assumptions or information about velocity anisotropy in the\nglobular cluster system.\n"}

We consider\nlarge-scale hydrodynamic motions where the viscosity and heat conduction can be\nneglected, and one arrives at the equations of ideal gas dynamics with an\nadditional term describing bulk energy losses due to inelastic collisions. We\nemploy Lagrangian coordinates and derive a broad family of exact non-stationary\nanalytical solutions that depend only on one spatial coordinate. These\nsolutions exhibit a new type of singularity, where the gas density blows up in\na finite time when starting from smooth initial conditions. The density blowups\nsignal formation of close-packed clusters of particles. As the density blow-up\ntime $t_c$ is approached, the maximum density exhibits a power law $\\sim\n(t_c-t)^{-2}$. The velocity gradient blows up as $\\sim - (t_c-t)^{-1}$ while\nthe velocity itself remains continuous and develops a cusp (rather than a shock\ndiscontinuity) at the singularity. The gas temperature vanishes at the\nsingularity, and the singularity follows the isobaric scenario: the gas\npressure remains finite and approximately uniform in space and constant in time\nclose to the singularity. An additional exact solution shows that the density\nblowup, of the same type, may coexist with an \"ordinary\" shock, at which the\nhydrodynamic fields are discontinuous but finite. We confirm stability of the\nexact solutions with respect to small one-dimensional perturbations by solving\nthe ideal hydrodynamic equations numerically. Furthermore, numerical solutions\nshow that the local features of the density blowup hold universally,\nindependently of details of the initial and boundary conditions.\n"}
{"text":"  We discuss a universality property of any covariant field theory in\nspace-time expanded around pp-wave backgrounds. According to this property the\nspace-time lagrangian density evaluated on a restricted set of field\nconfigurations, called universal sector, turns out to be same around all the\npp-waves, even off-shell, with same transverse space and same profiles for the\nbackground scalars. In this paper we restrict our discussion to tensorial\nfields only. In the context of bosonic string theory we consider on-shell\npp-waves and argue that universality requires the existence of a universal\nsector of world-sheet operators whose correlation functions are insensitive to\nthe pp-wave nature of the metric and the background gauge flux. Such results\ncan also be reproduced using the world-sheet conformal field theory. We also\nstudy such pp-waves in non-polynomial closed string field theory (CSFT). In\nparticular, we argue that for an off-shell pp-wave ansatz with flat transverse\nspace and dilaton independent of transverse coordinates the field redefinition\nrelating the low energy effective field theory and CSFT with all the massive\nmodes integrated out is at most quadratic in fields. Because of this\nsimplification it is expected that the off-shell pp-waves can be identified on\nthe two sides. Furthermore, given the massless pp-wave field configurations, an\niterative method for computing the higher massive modes using the CSFT\nequations of motion has been discussed. All our bosonic string theory analyses\ncan be generalised to the common Neveu-Schwarz sector of superstrings.\n"}

{"text":"  We have performed a detailed analysis of orbital motion in the vicinity of a\nnearly extremal Kerr black hole. For very rapidly rotating black holes (spin\na=J\/M>0.9524M) we have found a class of very strong field eccentric orbits\nwhose angular momentum L_z increases with the orbit's inclination with respect\nto the equatorial plane, while keeping latus rectum and eccentricity fixed.\nThis behavior is in contrast with Newtonian intuition, and is in fact opposite\nto the \"normal\" behavior of black hole orbits. Such behavior was noted\npreviously for circular orbits; since it only applies to orbits very close to\nthe black hole, they were named \"nearly horizon-skimming orbits\". Our analysis\ngeneralizes this result, mapping out the full generic (inclined and eccentric)\nfamily of nearly horizon-skimming orbits. The earlier work on circular orbits\nreported that, under gravitational radiation emission, nearly horizon-skimming\norbits tend to evolve to smaller orbit inclination, toward prograde equatorial\nconfiguration. Normal orbits, by contrast, always demonstrate slowly growing\norbit inclination (orbits evolve toward the retrograde equatorial\nconfiguration). Using up-to-date Teukolsky-fluxes, we have concluded that the\nearlier result was incorrect: all circular orbits, including nearly\nhorizon-skimming ones, exhibit growing orbit inclination. Using kludge fluxes\nbased on a Post-Newtonian expansion corrected with fits to circular and to\nequatorial Teukolsky-fluxes, we argue that the inclination grows also for\neccentric nearly horizon-skimming orbits.

As such, we conclude that these orbits are\nnot likely to have a clear and peculiar imprint on the gravitational waveforms\nexpected to be measured by the space-based detector LISA.\n"}

Our analysis of the complete Protein\nData Bank reveals several new knots which, along with previously discovered\nones, can shed light on such connections. In particular, we identify the most\ncomplex knot discovered to date in human ubiquitin hydrolase, and suggest that\nits entangled topology protects it against unfolding and degradation by the\nproteasome. Knots in proteins are typically preserved across species and\nsometimes even across kingdoms. However, we also identify a knot which only\nappears in some transcarbamylases while being absent in homologous proteins of\nsimilar structure. The emergence of the knot is accompanied by a shift in the\nenzymatic function of the protein. We suggest that the simple insertion of a\nshort DNA fragment into the gene may suffice to turn an unknotted into a\nknotted structure in this protein.\n"}
{"text":"  We consider an electrostatic qubit, interacting with a fluctuating charge of\nsingle electron transistor (SET) in the framework of exactly solvable model.\nThe SET plays a role of the fluctuating environment affecting the qubit's\nparameters in a controllable way. We derive the rate equations describing\ndynamics of the entire system for both weak and strong qubit-SET coupling.\nSolving these equation we obtain decoherence and relaxation rates of the qubit,\nas well as the spectral density of the fluctuating qubit's parameters. We found\nthat in the weak coupling regime the decoherence and relaxation rates are\ndirectly related to the spectral density taken at Rabi or at zero frequency,\ndepending on what a particular qubit's parameters is fluctuating. This relation\nholds also in the presence of weak back-action of the qubit on the fluctuating\nenvironment. In the case of strong back-action, such simple relationship no\nlonger holds, even if the qubit-SET coupling is small. It does not hold either\nin the strong-coupling regime, even in the absence of the back-action. In\naddition, we found that our model predicts localization of the qubit in the\nstrong-coupling regime, resembling that of the spin-boson model.\n"}
{"text":"  In this work we consider random Boolean networks that provide a general model\nfor genetic regulatory networks. We extend the analysis of James Lynch who was\nable to proof Kauffman's conjecture that in the ordered phase of random\nnetworks, the number of ineffective and freezing gates is large, where as in\nthe disordered phase their number is small. Lynch proved the conjecture only\nfor networks with connectivity two and non-uniform probabilities for the\nBoolean functions. We show how to apply the proof to networks with arbitrary\nconnectivity $K$ and to random networks with biased Boolean functions. It turns\nout that in these cases Lynch's parameter $\\lambda$ is equivalent to the\nexpectation of average sensitivity of the Boolean functions used to construct\nthe network. Hence we can apply a known theorem for the expectation of the\naverage sensitivity. In order to prove the results for networks with biased\nfunctions, we deduct the expectation of the average sensitivity when only\nfunctions with specific connectivity and specific bias are chosen at random.\n"}

Our Spitzer census\nof IC 348 reveals a population of protostars that is anti-correlated spatially\nwith the T-Tauri members, which comprise the centrally condensed cluster around\na B star. The protostars are instead found mostly at the cluster periphery\nabout 1 pc from the B star and spread out along a filamentary ridge. We find\nthat the star formation rate in this protostellar ridge is consistent with that\nrate which built the exposed cluster while the presence of fifteen cold,\nstarless, millimeter cores intermingled with this protostellar population\nindicates that the IC 348 nebula has yet to finish forming stars.

{"text":"  Given a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel, feedback from the\nreceiver can be used to specify a transmit precoding matrix, which selectively\nactivates the strongest channel modes.

We assume that channel elements are i.i.d. and known to the receiver,\nwhich relays the optimal (rate-maximizing) precoder codebook index to the\ntransmitter using B bits. We first derive the large system capacity of\nbeamforming (rank-one precoding matrix) as a function of B, where large system\nrefers to the limit as B and the number of transmit and receive antennas all go\nto infinity with fixed ratios. With beamforming RVQ is asymptotically optimal,\ni.e., no other quantization scheme can achieve a larger asymptotic rate. The\nperformance of RVQ is also compared with that of a simpler reduced-rank scalar\nquantization scheme in which the beamformer is constrained to lie in a random\nsubspace.

{"text":"  This article belongs to a series on geometric complexity theory (GCT), an\napproach to the P vs. NP and related problems through algebraic geometry and\nrepresentation theory. The basic principle behind this approach is called the\nflip.

In this\narticle, we suggest a plan for implementing the flip, i.e., for showing that\nthese relaxed decision problems belong to P. This is based on the reduction of\nthe preceding complexity-theoretic positive hypotheses to mathematical\npositivity hypotheses: specifically, to showing that there exist positive\nformulae--i.e. formulae with nonnegative coefficients--for the structural\nconstants under consideration and certain functions associated with them. These\nturn out be intimately related to the similar positivity properties of the\nKazhdan-Lusztig polynomials and the multiplicative structural constants of the\ncanonical (global crystal) bases in the theory of Drinfeld-Jimbo quantum\ngroups. The known proofs of these positivity properties depend on the Riemann\nhypothesis over finite fields and the related results. Thus the reduction here,\nin conjunction with the flip, in essence, says that the validity of the P vs.\nNP conjecture in characteristic zero is intimately linked to the Riemann\nhypothesis over finite fields and related problems.\n"}

X-ray observations reveal a bullet-like subcluster\nwith a prominent bow shock, while lensing results show that the positions of\nthe total mass peaks are consistent with the centroids of the collisionless\ngalaxies (and inconsistent with the X-ray brightness peaks). Previous studies,\nbased on older observational datasets, have placed upper limits on the\nself-interaction cross-section of dark matter per unit mass, sigma\/m, using\nsimplified analytic techniques. In this work, we take advantage of new,\nhigher-quality observational datasets by running N-body simulations of\n1E0657-56 that include the effects of self-interacting dark matter, and\ncomparing the results with observations. Furthermore, the recent data allow for\na new independent method of constraining sigma\/m, based on the non-observation\nof an offset between the bullet subcluster mass peak and galaxy centroid. This\nnew method places an upper limit (68% confidence) of sigma\/m < 1.25 cm^2\/g. If\nwe make the assumption that the subcluster and the main cluster had equal\nmass-to-light ratios prior to the merger, we derive our most stringent\nconstraint of sigma\/m < 0.7 cm^2\/g, which comes from the consistency of the\nsubcluster's observed mass-to-light ratio with the main cluster's, and with the\nuniversal cluster value, ruling out the possibility of a large fraction of dark\nmatter particles being scattered away due to collisions.

Spectral type standard star spectra scaled to the\ndereddened spectrum of A0620-00 in K exceed the A0620-00 spectrum in J and H\nfor all stars of spectral type K7V or earlier, demonstrating that the donor\nstar, unless later than K7V, cannot be the sole NIR flux source in A0620-00.

{"text":"  Context: How planet properties depend on stellar mass is a key diagnostic of\nplanetary formation mechanisms. Aims: This motivates planet searches around\nstars which are significantly more massive or less massive than the Sun, and in\nparticular our radial velocity search for planets around very-low mass stars.\nMethods: As part of that program, we obtained measurements of GJ 674, an M2.5\ndwarf at d=4.5 pc, which have a dispersion much in excess of their internal\nerrors. An intensive observing campaign demonstrates that the excess dispersion\nis due to two superimposed coherent signals, with periods of 4.69 and 35 days.\nResults: These data are well described by a 2-planet Keplerian model where each\nplanet has a ~11 Mearth minimum mass. A careful analysis of the (low level)\nmagnetic activity of GJ 674 however demonstrates that the 35-day period\ncoincides with the stellar rotation period. This signal therefore originates in\na spot inhomogeneity modulated by stellar rotation. The 4.69-day signal on the\nother hand is caused by a bona-fide planet, GJ 674b.

We discuss the metallicity distributions of M dwarf\nwith and without planets and find a low 11% probability that they are drawn\nfrom the same parent distribution.

Most notably, while the CO peak is nearly\ncoincident with the S140 H${\\alpha}$ arc, the maximum H$_2$CO absorption is\nclearly separated from it by a full 10$'$ beam ($\\sim$ 3 pc). We argue that\nthese differences result from differing abundances and excitation requirements.\nThe CO(1-0) line is more optically thick and more biased towards warm gas than\nthe H$_2$CO 6 cm line. On the other hand, formaldehyde is more easily\nphotodissociated and is, therefore, a poorer tracer of the molecular gas\nlocated immediately behind Photon Dominated Regions.\n"}
{"text":"  Common envelopes form in dynamical time scale mass exchange, when the\nenvelope of a donor star engulfs a much denser companion, and the core of the\ndonor plus the dense companion star spiral inward through this dissipative\nenvelope. As conceived by Paczynski and Ostriker, this process must be\nresponsible for the creation of short-period binaries with degenerate\ncomponents, and, indeed, it has proven capable of accounting for short-period\nbinaries containing one white dwarf component. However, attempts to reconstruct\nthe evolutionary histories of close double white dwarfs have proven more\nproblematic, and point to the need for enhanced systemic mass loss, either\nduring the close of the first, slow episode of mass transfer that produced the\nfirst white dwarf, or during the detached phase preceding the final, common\nenvelope episode. The survival of long-period interacting binaries with massive\nwhite dwarfs, such as the recurrent novae T CrB and RS Oph, also presents\ninterpretative difficulties for simple energetic treatments of common envelope\nevolution. Their existence implies that major terms are missing from usual\nformulations of the energy budget for common envelope evolution. The most\nplausible missing energy term is the energy released by recombination in the\ncommon envelope, and, indeed, a simple reformulation the energy budget\nexplicitly including recombination resolves this issue.\n"}

{"text":"  We investigate the evolution of binary fractions in star clusters using\nN-body models of up to 100000 stars. Primordial binary frequencies in these\nmodels range from 5% to 50%.

We find that the overall binary fraction of a\ncluster almost always remains close to the primordial value, except at late\ntimes when a cluster is near dissolution. A critical exception occurs in the\ncentral regions where we observe a marked increase in binary fraction with time\n-- a simulation starting with 100000 stars and 5% binaries reached a core\nbinary frequency as high as 40% at the end of the core-collapse phase\n(occurring at 16 Gyr with ~20000 stars remaining). Binaries are destroyed in\nthe core by a variety of processes as a cluster evolves, but the combination of\nmass-segregation and creation of new binaries in exchange interactions produces\nthe observed increase in relative number. We also find that binaries are cycled\ninto and out of cluster cores in a manner that is analogous to convection in\nstars. For models of 100000 stars we show that the evolution of the core-radius\nup to the end of the initial phase of core-collapse is not affected by the\nexact value of the primordial binary frequency (for frequencies of 10% or\nless). We discuss the ramifications of our results for the likely primordial\nbinary content of globular clusters.\n"}
{"text":"  Current cone jet algorithms, widely used at hadron colliders, take event\nparticles as seeds in an iterative search for stable cones. A longstanding\ninfrared (IR) unsafety issue in such algorithms is often assumed to be solvable\nby adding extra `midpoint' seeds, but actually is just postponed to one order\nhigher in the coupling. A proper solution is to switch to an exact seedless\ncone algorithm, one that provably identifies all stable cones. The only\nexisting approach takes N 2^N time to find jets among N particles, making it\nunusable at hadron level. This can be reduced to N^2 ln(N) time, leading to\ncode (SISCone) whose speed is similar to that of public midpoint\nimplementations. Monte Carlo tests provide a strong cross-check of an\nanalytical proof of the IR safety of the new algorithm, and the absence of any\n'R_{sep}' issue implies a good practical correspondence between parton and\nhadron levels. Relative to a midpoint cone, the use of an IR safe seedless\nalgorithm leads to modest changes for inclusive jet spectra, mostly through\nreduced sensitivity to the underlying event, and significant changes for some\nmulti-jet observables.\n"}

{"text":"  We systematically explore the evolution of the merger of two carbon-oxygen\n(CO) white dwarfs. The dynamical evolution of a 0.9 Msun + 0.6 Msun CO white\ndwarf merger is followed by a three-dimensional SPH simulation. We use an\nelaborate prescription in which artificial viscosity is essentially absent,\nunless a shock is detected, and a much larger number of SPH particles than\nearlier calculations. Based on this simulation, we suggest that the central\nregion of the merger remnant can, once it has reached quasi-static equilibrium,\nbe approximated as a differentially rotating CO star, which consists of a\nslowly rotating cold core and a rapidly rotating hot envelope surrounded by a\ncentrifugally supported disc. We construct a model of the CO remnant that\nmimics the results of the SPH simulation using a one-dimensional hydrodynamic\nstellar evolution code and then follow its secular evolution. The stellar\nevolution models indicate that the growth of the cold core is controlled by\nneutrino cooling at the interface between the core and the hot envelope, and\nthat carbon ignition in the envelope can be avoided despite high effective\naccretion rates. This result suggests that the assumption of forced accretion\nof cold matter that was adopted in previous studies of the evolution of double\nCO white dwarf merger remnants may not be appropriate. Our results imply that\nat least some products of double CO white dwarfs merger may be considered good\ncandidates for the progenitors of Type Ia supernovae.

{"text":"  Close pre-main-sequence binary stars are expected to clear central holes in\ntheir protoplanetary disks, but the extent to which material can flow from the\ncircumbinary disk across the gap onto the individual circumstellar disks has\nbeen unclear. In binaries with eccentric orbits, periodic perturbation of the\nouter disk is predicted to induce mass flow across the gap, resulting in\naccretion that varies with the binary period. This accretion may manifest\nitself observationally as periodic changes in luminosity. Here we present a\nsearch for such periodic accretion in the pre-main-sequence spectroscopic\nbinary UZ Tau E. We present BVRI photometry spanning three years; we find that\nthe brightness of UZ Tau E is clearly periodic, with a best-fit period of 19.16\n+\/- 0.04 days. This is consistent with the spectroscopic binary period of 19.13\ndays, refined here from analysis of new and existing radial velocity data. The\nbrightness of UZ Tau E shows significant random variability, but the overall\nperiodic pattern is a broad peak in enhanced brightness, spanning more than\nhalf the binary orbital period. The variability of the H-alpha line is not as\nclearly periodic, but given the sparseness of the data, some periodic component\nis not ruled out. The photometric variations are in good agreement with\npredictions from simulations of binaries with orbital parameters similar to\nthose of UZ Tau E, suggesting that periodic accretion does occur from\ncircumbinary disks, replenishing the inner disks and possibly extending the\ntimescale over which they might form planets.\n"}
{"text":"  The ever-increasing knowledge of the structure of various real-world networks\nhas uncovered their complex multi-mechanism-governed evolution processes.\nTherefore, a better understanding of the structure and evolution of these\nnetworked complex systems requires us to describe such processes in a more\ndetailed and realistic manner. In this paper, we introduce a new type of\nnetwork growth rule which comprises addition and deletion of nodes, and propose\nan evolving network model to investigate the effect of node deleting on network\nstructure. It is found that, with the introduction of node deleting, network\nstructure is significantly transformed.

We show that, for\nthermal atomic cesium with temperature in the range from 100 $\\mu$K to 400\n$\\mu$K in the vicinity of a silica surface with temperature of 300 K, the\nadsorption (free-to-bound decay) rate is about two times larger than the\nheating (free-to-free upward decay) rate, while the cooling (free-to-free\ndownward decay) rate is negligible.\n"}
{"text":"  A number of giant HII regions are associated with soft diffuse X-ray\nemission. Among these, the Carina nebula possesses the brightest soft diffuse\nemission. The required plasma temperature and thermal energy can be produced by\ncollisions or termination of fast winds from main-sequence or embedded young O\nstars, but the extended emission is often observed from regions apart from\nmassive stellar clusters. The origin of the X-ray emission is unknown.\n  The XIS CCD camera onboard Suzaku has the best spectral resolution for\nextended soft sources so far, and is therefore capable of measuring key\nemission lines in the soft band. Suzaku observed the core and the eastern side\nof the Carina nebula (Car-D1) in 2005 Aug and 2006 June, respectively. Spectra\nof the south part of the core and Car-D1 similarly showed strong L-shell lines\nof iron ions and K-shell lines of silicon ions, while in the north of the core\nthese lines were much weaker. Fitting the spectra with an absorbed thin-thermal\nplasma model showed kT~0.2, 0.6 keV and NH~1-2e21 cm-2 with a factor of 2-3\nabundance variation in oxygen, magnesium, silicon and iron. The plasma might\noriginate from an old supernova, or a super shell of multiple supernovae.\n"}
{"text":"  We present the results of a visible spectroscopic and photometric survey of\nJupiter Trojans belonging to different dynamical families carried out at the\nESO-NTT telescope.

(2006), constitute a total sample of\nvisible spectra for 80 objects. The survey allows us to investigate six\nfamilies (Aneas, Anchises, Misenus, Phereclos, Sarpedon, Panthoos) in the L5\ncloud and four L4 families (Eurybates, Menelaus, 1986 WD and 1986 TS6). The\nsample that we measured is dominated by D--type asteroids, with the exception\nof the Eurybates family in the L4 swarm, where there is a dominance of C- and\nP-type asteroids. All the spectra that we obtained are featureless with the\nexception of some Eurybates members, where a drop--off of the reflectance is\ndetected shortward of 5200 A. Similar features are seen in main belt C-type\nasteroids and commonly attributed to the intervalence charge transfer\ntransition in oxidized iron. Our sample comprises fainter and smaller Trojans\nas compared to the literature's data and allows us to investigate the\nproperties of objects with estimated diameter smaller than 40--50 km. The\nanalysis of the spectral slopes and colors versus the estimated diameters shows\nthat the blue and red objects have indistinguishable size distribution. We\nperform a statistical investigation of the Trojans's spectra property\ndistributions as a function of their orbital and physical parameters, and in\ncomparison with other classes of minor bodies in the outer Solar System.\nTrojans at lower inclination appear significantly bluer than those at higher\ninclination, but this effect is strongly driven by the Eurybates family.\n"}

{"text":"  The status of 38 halo white dwarf candidates identified by Oppenheimer et al.\n(2001) has been intensively discussed by various authors. In analyses\nundertaken to date, trigonometric parallaxes are crucial missing data. Distance\nmeasurements are mandatory to kinematically segregate halo object from disk\nobjects and hence enable a more reliable estimate of the local density of halo\ndark matter residing in such objects.\n  We present trigonometric parallax measurements for 15 candidate halo white\ndwarfs (WDs) selected from the Oppenheimer et al. (2001) list. We observed the\nstars using the ESO 1.56-m Danish Telescope and ESO 2.2-m telescope from August\n2001 to July 2004. Parallaxes with accuracies of 1--2 mas were determined\nyielding relative errors on distances of $\\sim5$% for 6 objects, $\\sim12$% for\n3 objects, and $\\sim20$% for two more objects. Four stars appear to be too\ndistant (probably farther than 100 pc) to have measurable parallaxes in our\nobservations. Distances, absolute magnitudes and revised space velocities were\nderived for the 15 halo WDs from the Oppenheimer et al. (2001) list. Halo\nmembership is confirmed unambiguously for 6 objects while 5 objects may be\nthick disk members and 4 objects are too distant to draw any conclusion based\nsolely on kinematics. Comparing our trigonometric parallaxes with photometric\nparallaxes used in previous work reveals an overestimation of distance as\nderived from photometric techniques. This new data set can be used to revise\nthe halo white dwarf space density, and that analysis will be presented in a\nsubsequent publication.\n"}
{"text":"  It has been recently argued through numerical work that rotating stars with a\nhigh degree of differential rotation are dynamically unstable against bar-mode\ndeformation, even for values of the ratio of rotational kinetic energy to\ngravitational potential energy as low as O(0.01). This may have implications\nfor gravitational wave astronomy in high-frequency sources such as core\ncollapse supernovae. In this paper we present high-resolution simulations,\nperformed with an adaptive mesh refinement hydrodynamics code, of such low\nT\/|W| bar-mode instability. The complex morphological features involved in the\nnonlinear dynamics of the instability are revealed in our simulations, which\nshow that the excitation of Kelvin-Helmholtz-like fluid modes outside the\ncorotation radius of the star leads to the saturation of the bar-mode\ndeformation. While the overall trends reported in an earlier investigation are\nconfirmed by our work, we also find that numerical resolution plays an\nimportant role during the long-term, nonlinear behaviour of the instability,\nwhich has implications on the dynamics of rotating stars and on the attainable\namplitudes of the associated gravitational wave signals.\n"}
{"text":"  Population structure induced by both spatial embedding and more general\nnetworks of interaction, such as model social networks, have been shown to have\na fundamental effect on the dynamics and outcome of evolutionary games. These\neffects have, however, proved to be sensitive to the details of the underlying\ntopology and dynamics. Here we introduce a minimal population structure that is\ndescribed by two distinct hierarchical levels of interaction. We believe this\nmodel is able to identify effects of spatial structure that do not depend on\nthe details of the topology. We derive the dynamics governing the evolution of\na system starting from fundamental individual level stochastic processes\nthrough two successive meanfield approximations. In our model of population\nstructure the topology of interactions is described by only two parameters: the\neffective population size at the local scale and the relative strength of local\ndynamics to global mixing. We demonstrate, for example, the existence of a\ncontinuous transition leading to the dominance of cooperation in populations\nwith hierarchical levels of unstructured mixing as the benefit to cost ratio\nbecomes smaller then the local population size. Applying our model of spatial\nstructure to the repeated prisoner's dilemma we uncover a novel and\ncounterintuitive mechanism by which the constant influx of defectors sustains\ncooperation. Further exploring the phase space of the repeated prisoner's\ndilemma and also of the \"rock-paper-scissor\" game we find indications of rich\nstructure and are able to reproduce several effects observed in other models\nwith explicit spatial embedding, such as the maintenance of biodiversity and\nthe emergence of global oscillations.\n"}
{"text":"  We explore the effect of an inhomogeneous mass density field on frequencies\nand wave profiles of torsional Alfven oscillations in solar coronal loops.\nDispersion relations for torsional oscillations are derived analytically in\nlimits of weak and strong inhomogeneities. These analytical results are\nverified by numerical solutions, which are valid for a wide range of\ninhomogeneity strength. It is shown that the inhomogeneous mass density field\nleads to the reduction of a wave frequency of torsional oscillations, in\ncomparison to that of estimated from mass density at the loop apex. This\nfrequency reduction results from the decrease of an average Alfven speed as far\nas the inhomogeneous loop is denser at its footpoints. The derived dispersion\nrelations and wave profiles are important for potential observations of\ntorsional oscillations which result in periodic variations of spectral line\nwidths. Torsional oscillations offer an additional powerful tool for a\ndevelopment of coronal seismology.\n"}
{"text":"  It has been observed that particular rate-1\/2 partially systematic parallel\nconcatenated convolutional codes (PCCCs) can achieve a lower error floor than\nthat of their rate-1\/3 parent codes. Nevertheless, good puncturing patterns can\nonly be identified by means of an exhaustive search, whilst convergence towards\nlow bit error probabilities can be problematic when the systematic output of a\nrate-1\/2 partially systematic PCCC is heavily punctured. In this paper, we\npresent and study a family of rate-1\/2 partially systematic PCCCs, which we\ncall pseudo-randomly punctured codes. We evaluate their bit error rate\nperformance and we show that they always yield a lower error floor than that of\ntheir rate-1\/3 parent codes. Furthermore, we compare analytic results to\nsimulations and we demonstrate that their performance converges towards the\nerror floor region, owning to the moderate puncturing of their systematic\noutput. Consequently, we propose pseudo-random puncturing as a means of\nimproving the bandwidth efficiency of a PCCC and simultaneously lowering its\nerror floor.\n"}
{"text":"  We present measurements of the infrared response of the quasi-one-dimensional\norganic conductor (TMTSF)2$SO3 along (E||a) and perpendicular (E||b') to the\nstacking axis as a function of temperature. Above the metal-insulator\ntransition related to the anion ordering the optical conductivity spectra show\na Drude-like response. Below the transition an energy gap of about 1500 cm-1\n(185 meV) opens, leading to the corresponding charge transfer band in the\noptical conductivity spectra. The analysis of the infrared-active vibrations\ngives evidence for the long-range crystal structure modulation below the\ntransition temperature and for the short-range order fluctuations of the\nlattice modulation above the transition temperature. Also we report about a new\ninfrared mode at around 710 cm-1 with a peculiar temperature behavior, which\nhas so far not been observed in any other (TMTSF)2X salt showing a\nmetal-insulator transition.

{"text":"  We study the potential of the CNGS beam in constraining the parameter space\nof a model with one sterile neutrino separated from three active ones by an\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\eVq)$ mass-squared difference, $\\Dmq_\\Sbl$.

We point out that the\nchannel with the largest potential to constrain the sterile neutrino parameter\nspace at the CNGS beam is $\\nu_\\mu \\to \\nu_\\tau$. The reason for that is\ntwofold: first, the active-sterile mixing angle that governs this oscillation\nis the less constrained by present experiments; second, this is the signal for\nwhich both OPERA and ICARUS have been designed, and thus benefits from an\nextremely low background. In our analysis we also took into account $\\nu_\\mu\n\\to \\nu_e$ oscillations.

{"text":"  We analyze the effect of gravitational radiation reaction on generic orbits\naround a body with an axisymmetric mass quadrupole moment Q to linear order in\nQ, to the leading post-Newtonian order, and to linear order in the mass ratio.\nThis system admits three constants of the motion in absence of radiation\nreaction: energy, angular momentum, and a third constant analogous to the\nCarter constant. We compute instantaneous and time-averaged rates of change of\nthese three constants. For a point particle orbiting a black hole, Ryan has\ncomputed the leading order evolution of the orbit's Carter constant, which is\nlinear in the spin. Our result, when combined with an interaction quadratic in\nthe spin (the coupling of the black hole's spin to its own radiation reaction\nfield), gives the next to leading order evolution. The effect of the\nquadrupole, like that of the linear spin term, is to circularize eccentric\norbits and to drive the orbital plane towards antialignment with the symmetry\naxis. In addition we consider a system of two point masses where one body has a\nsingle mass multipole or current multipole. To linear order in the mass ratio,\nto linear order in the multipole, and to the leading post-Newtonian order, we\nshow that there does not exist an analog of the Carter constant for such a\nsystem (except for the cases of spin and mass quadrupole).

Structural properties of networks\nrecently described allow their characterization as small-world, random\n(exponential) and scale-free. They complement the set of other properties that\nhave been explored in the context of brain connectivity, such as topology,\nhodology, clustering, and hierarchical organization.

Next we demonstrate that the same Weyl types characterize warped\nproduct spacetimes with a one-dimensional Lorentzian (timelike) factor, whereas\nwarped spacetimes with a two-dimensional Lorentzian factor are restricted to\nthe types D or O. By exploring the Bianchi identities, we then analyze the\nsimplest non-trivial case from the above classes - type D vacuum spacetimes,\npossibly with a cosmological constant, dropping, however, the assumptions that\nthe spacetime is static, stationary or warped. It is shown that for ``generic''\ntype D vacuum spacetimes the corresponding principal null directions are\ngeodetic in any dimension (this applies also to type II spacetimes).

The observed pattern in RMs requries the\npresence of at least one large-scale magnetic reversal in the fourth Galactic\nquadrant, located between the Sagittarius- Carina and Scutum-Crux spiral arms.\nTo quantitatively compare our measurements to other recent studies, we consider\nall available extragalactic and pulsar RMs in the region we have surveyed, and\njointly fit these data to simple models in which the large-scale field follows\nthe spiral arms. In the best-fitting model, the magnetic field in the fourth\nGalactic quadrant is directed clockwise in the Sagittarius-Carina spiral arm\n(as viewed from the North Galactic pole), but is oriented counter- clockwise in\nthe Scutum-Crux arm. This contrasts with recent analyses of pulsar RMs alone,\nin which the fourth-quadrant field was presumed to be directed\ncounter-clockwise in the Sagittarius- Carina arm.

Based on the 850 micron\nflux, we estimate the mass of the disk to be 18 lunar masses (0.2 Earth masses)\nassuming a mass opacity of 1.7 cm^2\/g with a temperature of 45 K. This makes\nthe TWA 7 disk (d=55 pc) an order of magnitude more massive than the disk\nreported around AU Microscopii (GL 803), the closest (9.9 pc) debris disk\ndetected around an M dwarf. This is consistent with TWA 7 being slightly\nyounger than AU Mic. We find that the mid-IR and submillimeter data require the\ndisk to be comprised of dust at a range of temperatures. A model in which the\ndust is at a single radius from the star, with a range of temperatures\naccording to grain size, is as effective at fitting the emission spectrum as a\nmodel in which the dust is of uniform size, but has a range of temperatures\naccording to distance.

A key issue examined is the\ndetermination of the so-called \"color correction factor\", which is often\nempirically introduced to account for the deviation of the local disk spectrum\nfrom a blackbody (due to electron scattering). This factor cannot be\npre-determined theoretically because it may vary with, e.g., mass accretion\nrate, among a number of important factors. We follow up on an earlier\nsuggestion to estimate the color correction observationally by modeling the\ndisk spectrum with saturated Compton scattering. We show that the spectra can\nbe fitted well and the approach yields reasonable values for the color\ncorrection factor. For comparison, we have also attempted to fit the spectra\nwith other models.

We ran hydrodynamic simulations with\ncosmological initial conditions in the standard LambdaCDM model, with\nmetallicities, from zero to 10^-2 Zsolar, beginnning at redshift, z = 99. The\nsimulations were run until a dense core forms at the center of a 5 x 10^5\nMsolar dark matter halo, at z ~ 18. Analysis of the central 1 Msolar core\nreveals that the two simulations with the lowest metallicities, Z = 0 and 10^-4\nZsolar, contain one clump with 99% of the mass, while the two with\nmetallicities, Z = 10^-3 and 10^-2 Zsolar, each contain two clumps that share\nmost of the mass. The Z = 10^-3 Zsolar simulation also produced two low-mass\nproto-stellar objects with masses between 10^-2 and 10^-1 Msolar. Gas with Z >=\n10^-3 Zsolar is able to cool to the temperature of the CMB, which sets a lower\nlimit to the minimum fragmentation mass.

These Swift observations are a unique data-set for an\noutburst of a SFXT, thanks to the combination of sensitivity and time coverage,\nand they allowed a study of IGR J11215-5952 from outburst onset to almost\nquiescence. We find that the accretion phase lasts longer than previously\nthought on the basis of lower sensitivity instruments observing only the\nbrightest flares. The observed phenomenology is consistent with a smoothly\nincreasing flux triggered at the periastron passage in a wide eccentric orbit\nwith many flares superimposed, possibly due to episodic or inhomogeneous\naccretion.\n"}
{"text":"  We present the first systematic investigation of the [NeV] (14um\/24um) and\n[SIII] (18um\/33um) infrared line flux ratios, traditionally used to estimate\nthe density of the ionized gas, in a sample of 41 Type 1 and Type 2 active\ngalactic nuclei (AGNs) observed with the Infrared Spectrograph on board\nSpitzer. The majority of galaxies with both [NeV] lines detected have observed\n[NeV] line flux ratios consistent with or below the theoretical low density\nlimit, based on calculations using currently available collision strengths and\nignoring absorption and stimulated emission. We find that Type 2 AGNs have\nlower line flux ratios than Type 1 AGNs and that all of the galaxies with line\nflux ratios below the low density limit are Type 2 AGNs. We argue that\ndifferential infrared extinction to the [NeV] emitting region due to dust in\nthe obscuring torus is responsible for the ratios below the low density limit\nand we suggest that the ratio may be a tracer of the inclination angle of the\ntorus to our line of sight. Because the temperature of the gas, the amount of\nextinction, and the effect of absorption and stimulated emission on the line\nratios are all unknown, we are not able to determine the electron densities\nassociated with the [NeV] line flux ratios for the objects in our sample. We\nalso find that the [SIII] emission from the galaxies in our sample is extended\nand originates primarily in star forming regions. Since the emission from\nlow-ionization species is extended, any analysis using line flux ratios from\nsuch species obtained from slits of different sizes is invalid for most nearby\ngalaxies.\n"}
{"text":"  We argue that non-Abelian gauge fields can be treated as the pseudo-Goldstone\nvector bosons caused by spontaneous Lorentz invariance violation (SLIV). To\nthis end, the SLIV which evolves in a general Yang-Mills type theory with the\nnonlinear vector field constraint $Tr(% \\boldsymbol{A}_{\\mu\n}\\boldsymbol{A}^{\\mu})=\\pm M^{2}$ ($M$ is a proposed SLIV scale) imposed is\nconsidered in detail. With an internal symmetry group $G$ having $D$ generators\nnot only the pure Lorentz symmetry SO(1,3), but the larger accidental symmetry\n$SO(D,3D)$ of the SLIV constraint in itself appears to be spontaneously broken\nas well. As a result, while the pure Lorentz violation still generates only one\ngenuine Goldstone vector boson, the accompanying pseudo-Goldstone vector bosons\nrelated to the $SO(D,3D)$ breaking also come into play in the final arrangement\nof the entire Goldstone vector field multiplet. Remarkably, they remain\nstrictly massless, being protected by gauge invariance of the Yang-Mills theory\ninvolved. We show that, although this theory contains a plethora of Lorentz and\n$CPT$ violating couplings, they do not lead to physical SLIV effects which turn\nout to be strictly cancelled in all the lowest order processes considered.\nHowever, the physical Lorentz violation could appear if the internal gauge\ninvariance were slightly broken at very small distances influenced by gravity.\nFor the SLIV scale comparable with the Planck one the Lorentz violation could\nbecome directly observable at low energies.\n"}
{"text":"  The effect of possible in-medium modifications of nucleon-nucleon ($NN$)\ncross sections on particle production is investigated in heavy ion collisions\n($HIC$) at intermediate energies. In particular, using a fully covariant\nrelativistic transport approach, we see that the density dependence of the {\\it\ninelastic} cross sections appreciably affects the pion and kaon yields and\ntheir rapidity distributions. However, the $(\\pi^{-}\/\\pi^{+})$- and\n$(K^{0}\/K^{+})$-ratios depend only moderately on the in-medium behavior of the\ninelastic cross sections. This is particularly true for kaon yield ratios,\nsince kaons are more uniformly produced in high density regions. Kaon\npotentials are also suitably evaluated in two schemes, a chiral perturbative\napproach and an effective meson-quark coupling method, with consistent results\nshowing a similar repulsive contribution for $K^{+}$ and $K^{0}$. As a\nconsequence we expect rather reduced effects on the yield ratios. We conclude\nthat particle ratios appear to be robust observables for probing the nuclear\nequation of state ($EoS$) at high baryon density and, particularly, its\nisovector sector.\n"}
{"text":"  During a crossover via a switching mechanism from one 2-body potential to\nanother as might be applied in modeling (chemical) reactions in the vicinity of\nbond formation, energy violations would occur due to finite step size which\ndetermines the trajectory of the particles relative to the potential\ninteractions of the unbonded state by numerical (e.g. Verlet) integration. This\nproblem is overcome by an algorithm which preserves the coordinates of the\nsystem for each move, but corrects for energy discrepancies by ensuring both\nenergy and momentum conservation in the dynamics. The algorithm is tested for a\nhysteresis loop reaction model with an without the implementation of the\nalgorithm. The tests involve checking the rate of energy flow out of the MD\nsimulation box; in the equilibrium state, no net rate of flows within\nexperimental error should be observed. The temperature and pressure of the box\nshould also be invariant within the range of fluctuation of these quantities.\nIt is demonstrated that the algorithm satisfies these criteria.\n"}
{"text":"  It is known that a subset of fractional quantum Hall wave functions has been\nexpressed as conformal field theory (CFT) correlators, notably the Laughlin\nwave function at filling factor $\\nu=1\/m$ ($m$ odd) and its quasiholes, and the\nPfaffian wave function at $\\nu=1\/2$ and its quasiholes. We develop a general\nscheme for constructing composite-fermion (CF) wave functions from conformal\nfield theory. Quasiparticles at $\\nu=1\/m$ are created by inserting anyonic\nvertex operators, $P_{\\frac{1}{m}}(z)$, that replace a subset of the electron\noperators in the correlator. The one-quasiparticle wave function is identical\nto the corresponding CF wave function, and the two-quasiparticle wave function\nhas correct fractional charge and statistics and is numerically almost\nidentical to the corresponding CF wave function. We further show how to exactly\nrepresent the CF wavefunctions in the Jain series $\\nu = s\/(2sp+1)$ as the CFT\ncorrelators of a new type of fermionic vertex operators, $V_{p,n}(z)$,\nconstructed from $n$ free compactified bosons; these operators provide the CFT\nrepresentation of composite fermions carrying $2p$ flux quanta in the $n^{\\rm\nth}$ CF Landau level. We also construct the corresponding quasiparticle- and\nquasihole operators and argue that they have the expected fractional charge and\nstatistics.

{"text":"  We consider statistical mechanics models of continuous height effective\ninterfaces in the presence of a delta-pinning at height zero. There is a\ndetailed mathematical understanding of the depinning transition in 2 dimensions\nwithout disorder. Then the variance of the interface height w.r.t. the Gibbs\nmeasure stays bounded uniformly in the volume for any positive pinning force\nand diverges like the logarithm of the pinning force when it tends to zero.\n  How does the presence of a quenched disorder term in the Hamiltonian modify\nthis transition? We show that an arbitarily weak random field term is enough to\nbeat an arbitrarily strong delta-pinning in 2 dimensions and will cause\ndelocalization. The proof is based on a rigorous lower bound for the overlap\nbetween local magnetizations and random fields in finite volume. In 2\ndimensions it implies growth faster than the volume which is a contradiction to\nlocalization. We also derive a simple complementary inequality which shows that\nin higher dimensions the fraction of pinned sites converges to one when the\npinning force tends to infinity.\n"}
{"text":"  The presence of dust at high redshift requires efficient condensation of\ngrains in SN ejecta, in accordance with current theoretical models. Yet,\nobservations of the few well studied SNe and SN remnants imply condensation\nefficiencies which are about two orders of magnitude smaller. Motivated by this\ntension, we have (i) revisited the model of Todini & Ferrara (2001) for dust\nformation in the ejecta of core collapse SNe and (ii) followed, for the first\ntime, the evolution of newly condensed grains from the time of formation to\ntheir survival - through the passage of the reverse shock - in the SN remnant.\nWe find that 0.1 - 0.6 M_sun of dust form in the ejecta of 12 - 40 M_sun\nstellar progenitors. Depending on the density of the surrounding ISM, between\n2-20% of the initial dust mass survives the passage of the reverse shock, on\ntime-scales of about 4-8 x 10^4 yr from the stellar explosion. Sputtering by\nthe hot gas induces a shift of the dust size distribution towards smaller\ngrains. The resulting dust extinction curve shows a good agreement with that\nderived by observations of a reddened QSO at z =6.2. Stochastic heating of\nsmall grains leads to a wide distribution of dust temperatures. This supports\nthe idea that large amounts (~ 0.1 M_sun) of cold dust (T ~ 40K) can be present\nin SN remnants, without being in conflict with the observed IR emission.\n"}

Gas and dust\nproperties have been obtained comparing the observations with self-consistent\ndisk models for the dust and CO emission. The circumstellar disk is resolved\nboth in the continuum and in CO. We find strong evidence that the circumstellar\nmaterial is in Keplerian rotation around a central star of 2.6 Msun. The disk\ninclination with respect to the line of sight is 46+-4 deg with a position\nangle of 128+-4 deg. The slope of the dust opacity measured between 0.87 and 7\nmm (beta=1) confirms the presence of mm\/cm-size grains in the disk midplane.\nThe dust continuum emission is asymmetric and confined inside a radius of 200\nAU while the CO emission extends up to 540 AU. The comparison between dust and\nCO temperature indicates that CO is present only in the disk interior. Finally,\nwe obtain an increasing depletion of CO isotopomers from 12CO to 13CO and C18O.\nWe argue that these results support the idea that the disk of HD 163296 is\nstrongly evolved. In particular, we suggest that there is a strong depletion of\ndust relative to gas outside 200 AU; this may be due to the inward migration of\nlarge bodies that form in the outer disk or to clearing of a large gap in the\ndust distribution by a low mass companion.\n"}

The results are interpreted in MSSM benchmark scenarios\nin terms of the parameters tan_beta and the Higgs-boson mass scale, M_A. We\nstudy the dependence of the 5 sigma discovery contours in the M_A-tan_beta\nplane on variations of the other supersymmetric parameters.

While the variation of $\\mu$ can shift the\nprospective discovery reach (and correspondingly the ``LHC wedge'' region) by\nabout Delta tan_beta = 10, we find that the discovery reach is rather stable\nwith respect to the impact of other supersymmetric parameters. Within the\ndiscovery region we analyze the accuracy with which the masses of the heavy\nneutral Higgs bosons can be determined.

Our high yield\nrate of XMPGs suggests this is a powerful method for finding such populations.\nThe lowest metallicity measured in our sample is 12+log(O\/H) = 7.06\n(6.78-7.44), close to the minimum metallicity found in local galaxies. The\nluminosities, metallicities and star formation rates of USELs are consistent\nwith the strong emitters being start-up intermediate mass galaxies and suggest\nthat galaxies are still forming in relatively chemically pristine sites at z <\n1.\n"}
{"text":"  We report the first scattered light detection of a dusty debris disk\nsurrounding the F2V star HD 15115 using the Hubble Space Telescope in the\noptical, and Keck adaptive optics in the near-infrared. The most remarkable\nproperty of the HD 15115 disk relative to other debris disks is its extreme\nlength asymmetry. The east side of the disk is detected to ~315 AU radius,\nwhereas the west side of the disk has radius >550 AU. We find a blue optical to\nnear-infrared scattered light color relative to the star that indicates grain\nscattering properties similar to the AU Mic debris disk. The existence of a\nlarge debris disk surrounding HD 15115 adds further evidence for membership in\nthe Beta Pic moving group, which was previously argued based on kinematics\nalone. Here we hypothesize that the extreme disk asymmetry is due to dynamical\nperturbations from HIP 12545, an M star 0.5 degrees (0.38 pc) east of HD 15115\nthat shares a common proper motion vector, heliocentric distance, galactic\nspace velocity, and age.\n"}
{"text":"  Future detection\/non-detection of tensor modes from inflation in CMB\nobservations presents a unique way to test certain features of string theory.\nCurrent limit on the ratio of tensor to scalar perturbations, r=T\/S, is r <\n0.3, future detection may take place for r > 10^{-2}-10^{-3}. At present all\nknown string theory inflation models predict tensor modes well below the level\nof detection. Therefore a possible experimental discovery of tensor modes may\npresent a challenge to string cosmology.\n  The strongest bound on r in string inflation follows from the observation\nthat in most of the models based on the KKLT construction, the value of the\nHubble constant H during inflation must be smaller than the gravitino mass. For\nthe gravitino mass in the usual range, m_{3\/2} < O(1) TeV, this leads to an\nextremely strong bound r < 10^{-24}. A discovery of tensor perturbations with r\n> 10^{-3} would imply that the gravitinos in this class of models are\nsuperheavy, m_{3\/2} > 10^{13} GeV. This would have important implications for\nparticle phenomenology based on string theory.\n"}
{"text":"  In this paper a theoretical model of functioning of a neural circuit during a\nbehavioral response has been proposed. A neural circuit can be thought of as a\ndirected multigraph whose each vertex is a neuron and each edge is a synapse.\nIt has been assumed in this paper that the behavior of such circuits is\nmanifested through the collective behavior of neurons belonging to that\ncircuit. Behavioral information of each neuron is contained in the coefficients\nof the fast Fourier transform (FFT) over the output spike train. Those\ncoefficients form a vector in a multidimensional vector space. Behavioral\ndynamics of a neuronal network in response to strong aversive stimuli has been\nstudied in a vector space in which a suitable pseudometric has been defined.\nThe neurodynamical model of network behavior has been formulated in terms of\nexisting memory, synaptic plasticity and feelings. The model has an analogy in\nclassical electrostatics, by which the notion of force and potential energy has\nbeen introduced. Since the model takes input from each neuron in a network and\nproduces a behavior as the output, it would be extremely difficult or may even\nbe impossible to implement. But with the help of the model a possible\nexplanation for an hitherto unexplained neurological observation in human brain\nhas been offered. The model is compatible with a recent model of sequential\nbehavioral dynamics. The model is based on electrophysiology, but its relevance\nto hemodynamics has been outlined.\n"}
{"text":"  We carry out cosmological chemodynamical simulations with different strengths\nof supernova (SN) feedback and study how galactic winds from star-forming\ngalaxies affect the features of hydrogen (HI) and metal (CIV and OVI)\nabsorption systems in the intergalactic medium at high redshift. We find that\nthe outflows tend to escape to low density regions, and hardly affect the dense\nfilaments visible in HI absorption. As a result, the strength of HI absorption\nnear galaxies is not reduced by galactic winds, but even slightly increases. We\nalso find that a lack of HI absorption for lines of sight (LOS) close to\ngalaxies, as found by Adelberger et al., can be created by hot gas around the\ngalaxies induced by accretion shock heating. In contrast to HI, metal\nabsorption systems are sensitive to the presence of winds. The models without\nfeedback can produce the strong CIV and OVI absorption lines in LOS within 50\nkpc from galaxies, while strong SN feedback is capable of creating strong CIV\nand OVI lines out to about twice that distance. We also analyze the mean\ntransmissivity of HI, CIV, and OVI within 1 h$^{-1}$ Mpc from star-forming\ngalaxies. The probability distribution of the transmissivity of HI is\nindependent of the strength of SN feedback, but strong feedback produces LOS\nwith lower transmissivity of metal lines. Additionally, strong feedback can\nproduce strong OVI lines even in cases where HI absorption is weak. We conclude\nthat OVI is probably the best tracer for galactic winds at high redshift.\n"}

{"text":"  We quantify the variability of faint unresolved optical sources using a\ncatalog based on multiple SDSS imaging observations. The catalog covers SDSS\nStripe 82, and contains 58 million photometric observations in the SDSS ugriz\nsystem for 1.4 million unresolved sources. In each photometric bandpass we\ncompute various low-order lightcurve statistics and use them to select and\nstudy variable sources. We find that 2% of unresolved optical sources brighter\nthan g=20.5 appear variable at the 0.05 mag level (rms) simultaneously in the g\nand r bands. The majority (2\/3) of these variable sources are low-redshift (<2)\nquasars, although they represent only 2% of all sources in the adopted\nflux-limited sample. We find that at least 90% of quasars are variable at the\n0.03 mag level (rms) and confirm that variability is as good a method for\nfinding low-redshift quasars as is the UV excess color selection (at high\nGalactic latitudes). We analyze the distribution of lightcurve skewness for\nquasars and find that is centered on zero. We find that about 1\/4 of the\nvariable stars are RR Lyrae stars, and that only 0.5% of stars from the main\nstellar locus are variable at the 0.05 mag level. The distribution of\nlightcurve skewness in the g-r vs. u-g color-color diagram on the main stellar\nlocus is found to be bimodal (with one mode consistent with Algol-like\nbehavior). Using over six hundred RR Lyrae stars, we demonstrate rich halo\nsubstructure out to distances of 100 kpc.

{"text":"  The boundary conditions of the heliosphere are set by the ionization, density\nand composition of inflowing interstellar matter. Constraining the properties\nof the Local Interstellar Cloud (LIC) at the heliosphere requires radiative\ntransfer ionization models. We model the background interstellar radiation\nfield using observed stellar FUV and EUV emission and the diffuse soft X-ray\nbackground. We also model the emission from the boundary between the LIC and\nthe hot Local Bubble (LB) plasma, assuming that the cloud is evaporating\nbecause of thermal conduction. We create a grid of models covering a plausible\nrange of LIC and LB properties, and use the modeled radiation field as input to\nradiative transfer\/thermal equilibrium calculations using the Cloudy code. Data\nfrom in situ observations of He^O, pickup ions and anomalous cosmic rays in the\nheliosphere, and absorption line measurements towards epsilon CMa were used to\nconstrain the input parameters. A restricted range of assumed LIC HI column\ndensities and LB plasma temperatures produce models that match all the\nobservational constraints. The relative weakness of the constraints on N(HI)\nand T_h contrast with the narrow limits predicted for the H^O and electron\ndensity in the LIC at the Sun, n(H^0) = 0.19 - 0.20 cm^-3, and n(e) = 0.07 +\/-\n0.01 cm^-3. Derived abundances are mostly typical for low density gas, with\nsub-solar Mg, Si and Fe, possibly subsolar O and N, and S about solar; however\nC is supersolar.

{"text":"  The observed association of Long Gamma-Ray Bursts (LGRBs) with peculiar Type\nIc supernovae gives support to Woosley`s collapsar\/hypernova model, in which\nthe GRB is produced by the collapse of the rapidly rotating core of a massive\nstar to a black hole. The association of LGRBs with small star-forming galaxies\nsuggests low-metallicity to be a condition for a massive star to evolve to the\ncollapsar stage. Both completely-mixed single star models and binary star\nmodels are possible. In binary models the progenitor of the GRB is a massive\nhelium star with a close companion. We find that tidal synchronization during\ncore-helium burning is reached on a short timescale (less than a few\nmillennia). However, the strong core-envelope coupling in the subsequent\nevolutionary stages is likely to rule out helium stars with main-sequence\ncompanions as progenitors of hypernovae\/GRBs.

{"text":"  When the DNA double helix is subjected to external forces it can stretch\nelastically to elongations reaching 100% of its natural length.

Accordingly, a multiscale approach is necessary to capture the\nelectronic behavior of the stretched DNA helix. To construct such a model, we\nbegin with accurate density-functional-theory calculations for electronic\nstates in DNA bases and base pairs in various relative configurations\nencountered in the equilibrium and stretched forms. These results are\ncomplemented by semi-empirical quantum mechanical calculations for the states\nof a small size [18 base pair poly(CG)-poly(CG)] dry, neutral DNA sequence,\nusing previously published models for stretched DNA. The calculated electronic\nstates are then used to parametrize an effective tight-binding model that can\ndescribe electron hopping in the presence of environmental effects, such as the\npresence of stray water molecules on the backbone or structural features of the\nsubstrate. These effects introduce disorder in the model hamiltonian which\nleads to electron localization. The localization length is smaller by several\norders of magnitude in stretched DNA relative to that in the unstretched\nstructure.\n"}
{"text":"  Any color singlet or octet ccbar pair is created at short distances and then\nexpands to a full size of J\/psi. Such a dynamical evolution process is included\nhere in calculations for the J\/psi number distribution as a function of\ntransverse momentum and rapidity in central Au-Au collisions at both RHIC and\nLHC energies. The ccbar pairs are produced in the initial collision and in the\npartonic system during the prethermal and thermal stages through the partonic\nchannels ab to ccbar [{2S+1}L_J] and ab to ccbar [{2S+1}L_J]x, and then they\ndissociate in the latter two stages. Dissociation of ccbar in the medium occurs\nvia two reactions: (a) color singlet ccbar plus a gluon turns to color octet\nccbar, (b) color octet ccbar plus a gluon persists as color octet. There are\nmodest yields of ccbar in the prethermal stage at RHIC energy and through the\nreactions ab to ccbar [{2S+1}L_J] at LHC energy for partons with large average\nmomentum in the prethermal stage at both collider energies and in the thermal\nstage at LHC energy. Production from the partonic system competes with the\nsuppression of the initial yield in the deconfined medium. Consequently, a\nbulge within -1.5<y<1.5 has been found for the J\/psi number distribution and\nthe ratio of J\/psi number distributions for Au-Au collisions to nucleon-nucleon\ncollisions. This bulge is caused by the partonic system and is thus an\nindicator of a deconfined partonic medium. Based on this result we suggest the\nrapidity region worth measuring in future experiments at RHIC and LHC to be\n-3<y<3.\n"}
{"text":"  We propose a Hamiltonian formalism for a generalized\nFriedmann-Roberson-Walker cosmology model in the presence of both a variable\nequation of state (EOS) parameter $w(a)$ and a variable cosmological constant\n$\\Lambda(a)$, where $a$ is the scale factor. This Hamiltonian system containing\n1 degree of freedom and without constraint, gives Friedmann equations as the\nequation of motion, which describes a mechanical system with a variable mass\nobject moving in a potential field. After an appropriate transformation of the\nscale factor, this system can be further simplified to an object with constant\nmass moving in an effective potential field. In this framework, the $\\Lambda$\ncold dark matter model as the current standard model of cosmology corresponds\nto a harmonic oscillator.

{"text":"  Suprathreshold stochastic resonance (SSR) is a form of noise enhanced signal\ntransmission that occurs in a parallel array of independently noisy identical\nthreshold nonlinearities, including model neurons.

We show that this PSD is, in fact, well\nfitted by a `soft' state model which has only one break, at high frequencies.\nAlthough a `hard' state model can also fit the data, the improvement in fit by\nadding a second break at low frequency is not significant. Thus NGC 3783 is not\nunusual. These results leave Arakelian 564 as the only AGN which shows a second\nbreak at low frequencies, although in that case the very high accretion rate\nimplies a `very high', rather than `hard' state PSD. The break frequency found\nin NGC 3783 is consistent with the expectation based on comparisons with other\nAGN and GBHs, given its black hole mass and accretion rate.\n"}
{"text":"  The high volume of packets and packet rates of traffic on some router links\nmakes it exceedingly difficult for routers to examine every packet in order to\nkeep detailed statistics about the traffic which is traversing the router.\nSampling is commonly applied on routers in order to limit the load incurred by\nthe collection of information that the router has to undertake when evaluating\nflow information for monitoring purposes. The sampling process in nearly all\ncases is a deterministic process of choosing 1 in every N packets on a\nper-interface basis, and then forming the flow statistics based on the\ncollected sampled statistics. Even though this sampling may not be significant\nfor some statistics, such as packet rate, others can be severely distorted.\nHowever, it is important to consider the sampling techniques and their relative\naccuracy when applied to different traffic patterns. The main disadvantage of\nsampling is the loss of accuracy in the collected trace when compared to the\noriginal traffic stream. To date there has not been a detailed analysis of the\nimpact of sampling at a router in various traffic profiles and flow criteria.\nIn this paper, we assess the performance of the sampling process as used in\nNetFlow in detail, and we discuss some techniques for the compensation of loss\nof monitoring detail.\n"}

The observed SEDs are\nmodeled using a combination of an elliptical template and torus emission (using\nthe phenomenological templates of Silva et al. 2004) for six sources associated\nwith passive galaxies; for two point-like sources, the empirical SEDs of red\nquasars are adopted. The bolometric luminosities and the M_BH-L_K relation are\nused to provide an estimate of the masses and Eddington ratios of the black\nholes residing in these AGN.\n  Results: All of our sources are detected in the IRAC and MIPS (at 24 micron)\nbands. The SED modeling described above is in good agreement with the observed\nnear- and mid-infrared data. The derived bolometric luminosities are in the\nrange ~10^45-10^47 erg s^-1, and the median 2--10 keV bolometric correction is\n~25, consistent with the widely adopted value derived by Elvis et al. (1994).\nFor the objects with elliptical-like profiles in the K_s band, we derive high\nstellar masses (0.8-6.2)X10^11 Mo, black hole masses in the range\n(0.2-2.5)X10^9 Mo, and Eddington ratios L\/L_Edd<0.1, suggesting a low-accretion\nphase.\n"}

We have developed a new algorithm\nbased on clique percolation, that allows, for the first time, to investigate\nthe time dependence of overlapping communities on a large scale and as such, to\nuncover basic relationships characterising community evolution. Our focus is on\nnetworks capturing the collaboration between scientists and the calls between\nmobile phone users. We find that large groups persist longer if they are\ncapable of dynamically altering their membership, suggesting that an ability to\nchange the composition results in better adaptability. The behaviour of small\ngroups displays the opposite tendency, the condition for stability being that\ntheir composition remains unchanged. We also show that the knowledge of the\ntime commitment of the members to a given community can be used for estimating\nthe community's lifetime. These findings offer a new view on the fundamental\ndifferences between the dynamics of small groups and large institutions.\n"}
{"text":"  A quantum system composed of two or more subsystems can be in an entangled\nstate, i.e. a state in which the properties of the global system are well\ndefined but the properties of each subsystem are not. Entanglement is at the\nheart of quantum physics, both for its conceptual foundations and for\napplications in information processing and quantum communication. Remarkably,\nentanglement can be \"swapped\": if one prepares two independent entangled pairs\nA1-A2 and B1-B2, a joint measurement on A1 and B1 (called a \"Bell-State\nMeasurement\", BSM) has the effect of projecting A2 and B2 onto an entangled\nstate, although these two particles have never interacted or shared any common\npast[1,2]. Experiments using twin photons produced by spontaneous parametric\ndown-conversion (SPDC) have already demonstrated entanglement swapping[3-6],\nbut here we present its first realization using continuous wave (CW) sources,\nas originally proposed[2]. The challenge was to achieve sufficiently sharp\nsynchronization of the photons in the BSM. Using narrow-band filters, the\ncoherence time of the photons that undergo the BSM is significantly increased,\nexceeding the temporal resolution of the detectors. Hence pulsed sources can be\nreplaced by CW sources, which do not require any synchronization[6,7], allowing\nfor the first time the use of completely autonomous sources. Our experiment\nexploits recent progress in the time precision of photon detectors, in the\nefficiency of photon pair production by SPDC with waveguides in nonlinear\ncrystals[8], and in the stability of narrow-band filters. This approach is\nindependent of the form of entanglement; we employed time-bin entangled\nphotons[9] at telecom wavelengths. Our setup is robust against thermal or\nmechanical fluctuations in optical fibres thanks to cm-long coherence lengths.\n"}

The Compton-thin\nnature of such unabsorbed objects infers that the simple formulation of the\nUnified model for SyGs is not applicable in their case. The main goal of this\narticle is to investigate both gas distribution and ionization structure in the\ncircumnuclear region of NGC 7679 in search for the presence of a hidden Sy1\nnucleus, using the [O III] 5007 luminosity as a tracer of AGN activity.

The maximum of\nionization by the AGN power-law continuum traced by [O III] 5007\/Halpha ratio\nis displaced by ~ 13 arcsec eastward from the nucleus.

{"text":"  To investigate the universality of the structure of interactions in different\nmarkets, we analyze the cross-correlation matrix C of stock price fluctuations\nin the National Stock Exchange (NSE) of India. We find that this emerging\nmarket exhibits strong correlations in the movement of stock prices compared to\ndeveloped markets, such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). This is shown to\nbe due to the dominant influence of a common market mode on the stock prices.\nBy comparison, interactions between related stocks, e.g., those belonging to\nthe same business sector, are much weaker. This lack of distinct sector\nidentity in emerging markets is explicitly shown by reconstructing the network\nof mutually interacting stocks. Spectral analysis of C for NSE reveals that,\nthe few largest eigenvalues deviate from the bulk of the spectrum predicted by\nrandom matrix theory, but they are far fewer in number compared to, e.g., NYSE.\nWe show this to be due to the relative weakness of intra-sector interactions\nbetween stocks, compared to the market mode, by modeling stock price dynamics\nwith a two-factor model. Our results suggest that the emergence of an internal\nstructure comprising multiple groups of strongly coupled components is a\nsignature of market development.\n"}
{"text":"  We present a morphological study of galaxies in the A901\/902 supercluster\nfrom the COMBO-17 survey. A total of 570 galaxies with photometric redshifts in\nthe range 0.155 < z_phot < 0.185 are visually classified by three independent\nclassifiers to M_V=-18. These morphological classifications are compared to\nlocal galaxy density, distance from the nearest cluster centre, local surface\nmass density from weak lensing, and photometric classification. At high local\ngalaxy densities, log(Sigma_10 \/Mpc^2) > 1.5, a classical morphology-density\nrelation is found. A correlation is also found between morphology and local\nprojected surface mass density, but no trend is observed with distance to the\nnearest cluster. This supports the finding that local environment is more\nimportant to galaxy morphology than global cluster properties. The breakdown of\nthe morphological catalogue by colour shows a dominance of blue galaxies in the\ngalaxies displaying late-type morphologies and a corresponding dominance of red\ngalaxies in the early-type population. Using the 17-band photometry from\nCOMBO-17, we further split the supercluster red sequence into old passive\ngalaxies and galaxies with young stars and dust according to the prescription\nof Wolf et al.

{"text":"  We provide a model for how Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) laws, which describe the\ncorrelation between star formation rate and gas surface or volume density,\ndepend on the molecular line chosen to trace the gas. We show that, for lines\nthat can be excited at low temperatures, the KS law depends on how the line\ncritical density compares to the median density in a galaxy's star-forming\nmolecular clouds. High critical density lines trace regions with similar\nphysical properties across galaxy types, and this produces a linear correlation\nbetween line luminosity and star formation rate. Low critical density lines\nprobe regions whose properties vary across galaxies, leading to a star\nformation rate that varies superlinearly with line luminosity. We show that a\nsimple model in which molecular clouds are treated as isothermal and homogenous\ncan quantitatively reproduce the observed correlations between galactic\nluminosities in far infrared and in the CO(1->0) and HCN(1->0) lines, and\nnaturally explains why these correlations have different slopes.

This prediction may\nbe tested by observations of lines such as HCO^+(1->0) with intermediate\ncritical densities, or by HCN(1->0) observations of intensely star-forming high\nredshift galaxies with very high densities. Recent observations by Gao et al.\nhint at just such a change in slope.

{"text":"  We introduce a density tensor hierarchy for open system dynamics, that\nrecovers information about fluctuations lost in passing to the reduced density\nmatrix.

For the case of quantum fluctuations arising when a\nquantum system interacts with a quantum environment in an overall pure state,\nthe corresponding hierarchy is defined as the environmental trace of products\nof system matrix elements of the full density matrix. Only the lowest member of\nthe quantum noise hierarchy is directly experimentally measurable.

{"text":"  We present wide-field BVI photometry for about 11,500 stars in the\nlow-metallicity cluster NGC 5466. We have detected the red giant branch bump\nfor the first time, although it is at least 0.2 mag fainter than expected\nrelative to the turnoff. The number of red giants (relative to main sequence\nturnoff stars) is in excellent agreement with stellar models from the\nYonsei-Yale and Teramo groups, and slightly high compared to Victoria-Regina\nmodels. This adds to evidence that an abnormally large ratio of red giant to\nmain-sequence stars is not correlated with cluster metallicity. We discuss\ntheoretical predictions from different research groups and find that the\ninclusion or exclusion of helium diffusion and strong limit Coulomb\ninteractions may be partly responsible.\n  We also examine indicators of dynamical history: the mass function exponent\nand the blue straggler frequency. NGC 5466 has a very shallow mass function,\nconsistent with large mass loss and recently-discovered tidal tails. The blue\nstraggler sample is significantly more centrally concentrated than the HB or\nRGB stars. We see no evidence of an upturn in the blue straggler frequency at\nlarge distances from the center. Dynamical friction timescales indicate that\nthe stragglers should be more concentrated if the cluster's present density\nstructure has existed for most of its history. NGC 5466 also has an unusually\nlow central density compared to clusters of similar luminosity. In spite of\nthis, the specific frequency of blue stragglers that puts it right on the\nfrequency -- cluster M_V relation observed for other clusters.\n"}
{"text":"  Using numerical simulations, we investigate vortex configurations and pinning\nin superconductors with honeycomb and kagome pinning arrays.

The honeycomb and kagome pinning arrays\nproduce considerably more pronounced commensuration peaks in the critical\ndepinning force than triangular pinning arrays, and also cause additional peaks\nat noninteger matching fields where a portion of the vortices are located in\nthe large interstitial regions of the pinning lattices. For the honeycomb\npinning array, we find matching effects of equal strength at most fillings\nB\/B_\\phi=n\/2 for n>2, where n is an integer, in agreement with recent\nexperiments. For kagome pinning arrays, pronounced matching effects generally\noccur at B\/B_\\phi=n\/3 for n>3, while for triangular pinning arrays pronounced\nmatching effects are observed only at integer fillings B\/B_\\phi=n. At the\nnoninteger matching field peaks in the honeycomb and kagome pinning arrays, the\ninterstitial vortices are arranged in dimer, trimer, and higher order n-mer\nstates that have an overall orientational order. We call these n-mer states\n\"vortex molecular crystals\" and \"vortex plastic crystals\" since they are\nsimilar to the states recently observed in colloidal molecular crystal systems.\nWe argue that the vortex molecular crystals have properties in common with\ncertain spin systems such as Ising and n-state Potts models.

{"text":"  The discovery of a flux excess in the far-ultraviolet (UV) spectrum of\nelliptical galaxies was a major surprise in 1969. While it is now clear that\nthis UV excess is caused by an old population of hot helium-burning stars\nwithout large hydrogen-rich envelopes, rather than young stars, their origin\nhas remained a mystery. Here we show that these stars most likely lost their\nenvelopes because of binary interactions, similar to the hot subdwarf\npopulation in our own Galaxy. We have developed an evolutionary population\nsynthesis model for the far-UV excess of elliptical galaxies based on the\nbinary model developed by Han et al (2002, 2003) for the formation of hot\nsubdwarfs in our Galaxy. Despite its simplicity, it successfully reproduces\nmost of the properties of elliptical galaxies with a UV excess: the range of\nobserved UV excesses, both in $(1550-V)$ and $(2000-V)$, and their evolution\nwith redshift. We also present colour-colour diagrams for use as diagnostic\ntools in the study of elliptical galaxies. The model has major implications for\nunderstanding the evolution of the UV excess and of elliptical galaxies in\ngeneral. In particular, it implies that the UV excess is not a sign of age, as\nhad been postulated previously, and predicts that it should not be strongly\ndependent on the metallicity of the population, but exists universally from\ndwarf ellipticals to giant ellipticals.\n"}

{"text":"  Short time-scale radio variations of compact extragalactic radio sources,\nknown as IntraDay Variability, can be explained in at least some sources by a\nsource-extrinsic effect, in which the variations are interpreted as\nscintillation of radio waves caused by the turbulent ISM of the Milky Way. One\nof the most convincing observational arguments in favour of propagation-induced\nvariability is the so called annual modulation of the characteristic\nvariability time-scale, which is due to the orbital motion of the Earth. Data\nfor the recently discovered and highly variable IDV source J1128+5925 are\npresented. We study the frequency and time dependence of the IDV in this\ncompact quasar. We measure the characteristic variability time-scale of the IDV\nthroughout the year, and analyze whether the observed changes in the\nvariability time-scale are consistent with annual modulation. We monitored the\nflux density variability of J1128+5925 with dense time sampling between 2.7 and\n10.45GHz with the 100m Effelsberg radio telescope of the MPIfR and with the 25m\nUrumqi radio telescope. From ten observing sessions, we determine the\nvariability characteristics and time-scales. The observed pronounced changes of\nthe variability time-scale of J1128+5925 are modelled with an anisotropic\nannual modulation model. The observed frequency dependence of the variation is\nin good agreement with the prediction from interstellar scintillation. Adopting\na simple model for the annual modulation model and using also the frequency\ndependence of the IDV, we derive a lower limit to the distance of the\nscattering screen and an upper limit to the scintillating source size.

Therefore we conjecture that this scaling rule is a prevalent property\nof the science system. We observe that lower performance universities have a\nlarger size-dependent cumulative advantage for receiving citations than\ntop-performance universities. We also find that for the lower-performance\nuniversities the fraction of not-cited publications decreases considerably with\nsize.

Two cases of shock propagation are considered: 1)\nthrough a gradient of ambient density with a uniform ambient magnetic field; 2)\nthrough a homogeneous medium with a gradient of ambient magnetic field\nstrength. From the simulations, we synthesize the synchrotron radio emission,\nmaking different assumptions about the details of acceleration and injection of\nrelativistic electrons.\n  RESULTS: We find that asymmetric BSNRs are produced if the line-of-sight is\nnot aligned with the gradient of ambient plasma density or with the gradient of\nambient magnetic field strength.

{"text":"  Pattern formation and evolution in unsynchronizable complex networks are\ninvestigated. Due to the asymmetric topology, the synchronous patterns formed\nin complex networks are irregular and nonstationary. For coupling strength\nimmediately out of the synchronizable region, the typical phenomenon is the\non-off intermittency of the system dynamics. The patterns appeared in this\nprocess are signatured by the coexistence of a giant cluster, which comprises\nmost of the nodes, and a few number of small clusters. The pattern evolution is\ncharacterized by the giant cluster irregularly absorbs or emits the small\nclusters. As the coupling strength leaves away from the synchronization\nbifurcation point, the giant cluster is gradually dissolved into a number of\nsmall clusters, and the system dynamics is characterized by the integration and\nseparation of the small clusters. Dynamical mechanisms and statistical\nproperties of the nonstationary pattern evolution are analyzed and conducted,\nand some scalings are newly revealed. Remarkably, it is found that the few\nactive nodes, which escape from the giant cluster with a high frequency, are\nindependent of the coupling strength while are sensitive to the bifurcation\ntypes.

As\nan illustration of the use of our general formulae, we further show that $Z^0\n\\to \\nu + \\nu$ is forbidden for the standard or twisted coproduct of the\nPoincar\\'{e} group if the neutrino is massless, even if lepton number is not\nconserved. This is a special case of our general result that a massive particle\nof spin $j$ cannot decay into two identical massless particles of the same\nhelicity if $j$ is odd, regardless of the coproduct used.\n"}
{"text":"  The Katz-Sarnak density conjecture states that, in the limit as the\nconductors tend to infinity, the behavior of normalized zeros near the central\npoint of families of L-functions agree with the N -> oo scaling limits of\neigenvalues near 1 of subgroups of U(N). Evidence for this has been found for\nmany families by studying the n-level densities; for suitably restricted test\nfunctions the main terms agree with random matrix theory. In particular, all\none-parameter families of elliptic curves with rank r over Q(T) and the same\ndistribution of signs of functional equations have the same limiting behavior.\nWe break this universality and find family dependent lower order correction\nterms in many cases; these lower order terms have applications ranging from\nexcess rank to modeling the behavior of zeros near the central point, and\ndepend on the arithmetic of the family. We derive an alternate form of the\nexplicit formula for GL(2) L-functions which simplifies comparisons, replacing\nsums over powers of Satake parameters by sums of the moments of the Fourier\ncoefficients lambda_f(p). Our formula highlights the differences that we expect\nto exist from families whose Fourier coefficients obey different laws (for\nexample, we expect Sato-Tate to hold only for non-CM families of elliptic\ncurves). Further, by the work of Rosen and Silverman we expect lower order\nbiases to the Fourier coefficients in families of elliptic curves with rank\nover Q(T); these biases can be seen in our expansions. We analyze several\nfamilies of elliptic curves and see different lower order corrections,\ndepending on whether or not the family has complex multiplication, a forced\ntorsion point, or non-zero rank over Q(T).\n"}

{"text":"  We study the dependence of the isophotal shape of early-type galaxies on\ntheir absolute B-band magnitude, their dynamical mass, and their nuclear\nactivity and environment, using an unprecedented large sample of 847 early-type\ngalaxies identified in the SDSS by Hao et al (2006).

There is also a host of significant correlations\nbetween the disky fraction and indicators of nuclear activity (both in the\noptical and in the radio) and environment (soft X-rays, group mass, group\nhierarchy). Our analysis shows however that these correlations can be\naccurately matched by assuming that the disky fraction depends only on galaxy\nluminosity or mass. We therefore conclude that neither the level of activity,\nnor group mass or group hierarchy help in better predicting the isophotal shape\nof early-type galaxies.\n"}
{"text":"  Using a semi-analytical model for galaxy formation, combined with a large\nN-body simulation, we investigate the origin of the dichotomy among early-type\ngalaxies. We find that boxy galaxies originate from mergers with a progenitor\nmass ratio $n < 2$ and with a combined cold gas mass fraction $F_{\\rm cold} <\n0.1$. Our model accurately reproduces the observed fraction of boxy systems as\na function of luminosity and halo mass, for both central galaxies and\nsatellites. After correcting for the stellar mass dependence, the properties of\nthe last major merger of early-type galaxies are independent of their halo\nmass. This provides theoretical support for the conjecture of Pasquali et al\n(2007) that the stellar mass of an early-type galaxy is the main parameter that\ngoverns its isophotal shape. We argue that the observed dichotomy of early-type\ngalaxies has a natural explanation within hierarchical structure formation, and\ndoes not require AGN feedback. Rather, we argue that it owes to the fact that\nmore massive systems (i) have more massive progenitors, (ii) assemble later,\nand (iii) have a larger fraction of early-type progenitors. Each of these three\ntrends causes the cold gas mass fraction of the progenitors of more massive\nearly-types to be lower, so that their last major merger was dryer. Finally,\nour model predicts that (i) less than 10 percent of all early-type galaxies\nform in major mergers that involve two early-type progenitors, (ii) more than\n95 percent of all boxy early-type galaxies with $M_* < 2 \\times 10^{10} h^{-1}\n\\Msun$ are satellite galaxies, and (iii) about 70 percent of all low mass\nearly-types do not form a supermassive black hole binary at their last major\nmerger. The latter may help to explain why low mass early-types have central\ncusps, while their massive counterparts have cores.\n"}
{"text":"  In Volborthite, spin-1\/2 moments form a distorted Kagom\\'e lattice, of corner\nsharing isosceles triangles with exchange constants $J$ on two bonds and $J'$\non the third bond.

We consider degeneracy\nlifting by thermal and quantum fluctuations. To linear (spin wave) order, the\ndegeneracy is found to stay intact. Two complementary approaches are therefore\nintroduced, appropriate to low and high temperatures, which point to the same\nordered pattern. In the low temperature limit, an effective chirality\nHamiltonian is derived from non-linear spin waves which predicts a transition\non increasing $J'\/J$, from $\\sqrt 3\\times \\sqrt 3$ type order to a new\nferrimagnetic {\\em striped chirality} order with a doubled unit cell.

As such, the achievable dynamic range with our\nalgorithm surpasses the current practical limit of N-body codes by orders of\nmagnitude. This is particularly significant in studies of reionization, where\nthe dynamic range is the principal limiting factor.

{"text":"  In a sensor network, in practice, the communication among sensors is subject\nto:(1) errors or failures at random times; (3) costs; and(2) constraints since\nsensors and networks operate under scarce resources, such as power, data rate,\nor communication.

From this investigation, we find consistent result from\nprevious studies that the probability increases with the increase of the\nmagnification. The increase rate is boosted at a certain magnification at which\nperturbations caused by central caustic begin to occur. We find this boost\noccurs at moderate magnifications of $A\\lesssim 20$, implying that probability\ncan be high even for events with moderate magnifications. The probability\nincreases as the source brightness increases.

In the absence of rare the prime target\nof very high-magnification events, we, therefore, recommend to observe events\nwith brightest source stars and highest magnifications among the alerted\nevents.

Because ions are\ngenerally decoupled from the magnetic field by neutral collisions while\nelectrons are not, the Hall effect tends to dominate the diffusion of the\nmagnetic field when it is able to partially couple to the gas.\n  For a standard population of 0.1 micron grains the active surface layers have\na combined column of about 2 g\/cm^2 at 1 AU; by the time grains have aggregated\nto 3 microns the active surface density is 80 g\/cm^2. In the absence of grains,\nx-rays maintain magnetic coupling to 10% of the disk material at 1 AU (150\ng\/cm^2). At 5 AU the entire disk thickness becomes active once grains have\naggregated to 1 micron in size.\n"}

Using data obtained with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer and Chandra\nX-ray observatories we have derived an updated timing ephemeris of the 136 ms\npulsar spanning 6 years. During this interval, however, the period evolution\nshows significant variability from the best fit constant spin-down rate of\n$\\dot P = 7.5112(6) \\times 10^{-13}$ s s$^{-1}$, suggesting strong timing noise\nand\/or glitch activity.

The spectrum of the pulsed\nemission is well fitted with an absorbed power law of photon index $\\Gamma =\n1.2\\pm0.2$; this is marginally harder than that of the unpulsed component.

{"text":"  There are two promising scenarios that explain the ankle, which is a dip in\nthe spectrum of cosmic rays at $\\sim 10^{19}$ eV. A scenario interprets the\nankle as the transition from Galactic to extragalactic cosmic rays ({\\it\nankle-transition scenario}), while the other is that the dip caused by pair\nproduction on the cosmic microwave background radiation ({\\it proton-dip\nscenario}). In this paper, we consider whether cosmogenic neutrinos can be a\nclue to judge which scenario is favored. We calculated the fluxes of cosmogenic\nneutrinos following these scenarios with plausible physical parameter sets, and\nfound several important features as follows. First of all, the neutrino flux at\n$\\sim 10^{20}$ eV becomes much higher in the ankle-transition scenario as long\nas the maximum energy of the cosmic rays at sources is sufficiently high. On\nthe other hand, the neutrino spectrum has a characteristic peak at $\\sim\n10^{16}$ eV in the proton-dip scenario on the condition that extragalactic\nprotons significantly contribute to the observed cosmic rays down to $10^{17}$\neV. Thus, we conclude cosmogenic neutrinos should give us a clue to judge which\nscenario is favored, unless these features are masked by the neutrino\nbackground coming from possible, powerful neutrino sources such as AGNs and\nGRBs. We also found an interesting feature that the neutrino flux at $\\sim\n10^{18}$ eV depends only on the cosmological evolution of the cosmic ray\nsources. That means cosmogenic neutrinos with the energy bring us information\non the cosmological evolution of the sources of ultra-high energy cosmic rays.\nFinally, we compare the fluxes of cosmogenic neutrinos with the expected\nsensitivity curves of several neutrino detectors, and conclude the detection of\ncosmogenic neutrinos in the near future is promising.\n"}

The spin excitation in\nYBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_y$ is dominated by a sharp resonance peak at the frequency 40\nmeV in the superconducting state. Below and above the resonance frequency, the\nincommensurate (IC) peaks develop and the intensity of the peaks decreases\ndramatically. In the normal state, the resonant excitation does not occur and\nthe IC peaks are merged into commensurate ones. The spin excitation of\nLa$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ is significantly different from that of Y-based ones,\nnamely, the resonance peak does not exist due to the decreasing of the\nsuperconducting gap and the presence of the possible spin-stripe order.

On the other hand, another frequency scale at\nthe frequency 55 meV is also revealed, namely the spectra are commensurate and\nlocal maximum at this frequency. We elaborate all the results based on the\nFermi surface topology and the d-wave superconductivity, and suggest that the\nspin-stripe order be also important in determining the spin excitation of\nLa-based cuprates.

If\nthe emitter moves away from us, a redshift is observed. If the emitter moves\ntowards us, whether a redshift, a blueshift or no shift is observed will depend\non the speed vs. the distance. If the speed is in the range of\nc(exp[-beta*D]-1) < v < 0, a redshift is observed; if the speed equals\nc(exp[-beta*D]-1), no shift is observed; if the speed v less than\nc(exp[-beta*D]-1), a blueshift is observed. A redshift will be always observed\nin all directions for any celestial objects as long as their distance from us\nis large enough. Therefore, many more redshifts than blueshifts should be\nobserved for galaxies and supernovae, etc in the sky. This conclusion agrees\nwith current observations.

{"text":"  We argue that all transient searches for planets in globular clusters have a\nvery low detection probability. Planets of low metallicity stars typically do\nnot reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system\nproperties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is\nconsidered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,\nrespectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems\nat high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,\nwhere M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is\nonly at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie. Therefore, it\nis still possible that planets exist around main sequence stars in globular\nclusters, although at small numbers because of the low metallicity, and at\norbital periods of >~10 days. We discuss the implications of our conclusions on\nthe role that companions can play in the evolution of their parent stars in\nglobular clusters, e.g., influencing the distribution of horizontal branch\nstars on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of some globular clusters, and in\nforming low mass white dwarfs.\n"}
{"text":"  Recently it has been shown that string instanton effects may give rise to\nneutrino Majorana masses in certain classes of semi-realistic string\ncompactifications. In this paper we make a systematic search for supersymmetric\nMSSM-like Type II Gepner orientifold constructions admitting boundary states\nassociated with instantons giving rise to neutrino Majorana masses and other L-\nand\/or B-violating operators. We analyze the zero mode structure of D-brane\ninstantons on general type II orientifold compactifications, and show that only\ninstantons with O(1) symmetry can have just the two zero modes required to\ncontribute to the 4d superpotential. We however discuss how the addition of\nfluxes and\/or possible non-perturbative extensions of the orientifold\ncompactifications would allow also instantons with $Sp(2)$ and U(1) symmetries\nto generate such superpotentials. In the context of Gepner orientifolds with\nMSSM-like spectra, we find no models with O(1) instantons with just the\nrequired zero modes to generate a neutrino mass superpotential. On the other\nhand we find a number of models in one particular orientifold of the Gepner\nmodel $(2,4,22,22)$ with $Sp(2)$ instantons with a few extra uncharged\nnon-chiral zero modes which could be easily lifted by the mentioned effects. A\nfew more orientifold examples are also found under less stringent constraints\non the zero modes. This class of $Sp(2)$ instantons have the interesting\nproperty that R-parity conservation is automatic and the flavour structure of\nthe neutrino Majorana mass matrices has a simple factorized form.\n"}
{"text":"  The vacuum dependence on boundary conditions in quantum field theories is\nanalysed from a very general viewpoint. From this perspective the\nrenormalization prescriptions not only imply the renormalization of the\ncouplings of the theory in the bulk but also the appearance of a flow in the\nspace of boundary conditions. For regular boundaries this flow has a large\nvariety of fixed points and no cyclic orbit. The family of fixed points\nincludes Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions. In one-dimensional field\ntheories pseudoperiodic and quasiperiodic boundary conditions are also RG fixed\npoints. Under these conditions massless bosonic free field theories are\nconformally invariant. Among all fixed points only Neumann boundary conditions\nare infrared stable fixed points. All other conformal invariant boundary\nconditions become unstable under some relevant perturbations. In finite volumes\nwe analyse the dependence of the vacuum energy along the trajectories of the\nrenormalization group flow providing an interesting framework for dark energy\nevolution. On the contrary, the renormalization group flow on the boundary does\nnot affect the leading behaviour of the entanglement entropy of the vacuum in\none-dimensional conformally invariant bosonic theories.\n"}

Accordingly, one-range addition theorems for the\nCoulomb potential diverge in the mean. Instead, these one-range addition\ntheorems have to interpreted as expansions of generalized functions in the\nsense of Schwartz that converge weakly in suitable functionals.\n"}

We have studied the effect of RBC orientation related to the\ndirection of the incident light upon the indicatrix. Numerical calculations of\nindicatrices for several aspect ratios and volumes of RBC have been carried\nout. Comparison of the simulated indicatrices and indicatrices measured by SFC\nshowed good agreement, validating the biconcave disk model for a mature RBC. We\nsimulated the light-scattering output signals from the SFC with the DDA for\nRBCs modeled as a disk-sphere and as an oblate spheroid. The biconcave disk,\nthe disk-sphere, and the oblate spheroid models have been compared for two\norientations, i.e. face-on and rim-on incidence. Only the oblate spheroid model\nfor rim-on incidence gives results similar to the rigorous biconcave disk\nmodel.\n"}
{"text":"  A general class of loop quantizations for anisotropic models is introduced\nand discussed, which enhances loop quantum cosmology by relevant features seen\nin inhomogeneous situations. The main new effect is an underlying lattice which\nis being refined during dynamical changes of the volume. In general, this leads\nto a new feature of dynamical difference equations which may not have constant\nstep-size, posing new mathematical problems. It is discussed how such models\ncan be evaluated and what lattice refinements imply for semiclassical behavior.\nTwo detailed examples illustrate that stability conditions can put strong\nconstraints on suitable refinement models, even in the absence of a fundamental\nHamiltonian which defines changes of the underlying lattice. Thus, a large\nclass of consistency tests of loop quantum gravity becomes available. In this\ncontext, it will also be seen that quantum corrections due to inverse powers of\nmetric components in a constraint are much larger than they appeared recently\nin more special treatments of isotropic, free scalar models where they were\nartificially suppressed.\n"}
{"text":"  It is known that when hard spheres are added to a pure system of hard rods\nthe stability of the smectic phase may be greatly enhanced, and that this\neffect can be rationalised in terms of depletion forces. In the present paper\nwe first study the effect of orientational order on depletion forces in this\nparticular binary system, comparing our results with those obtained adopting\nthe usual approximation of considering the rods parallel and their orientations\nfrozen. We consider mixtures with rods of different aspect ratios and spheres\nof different diameters, and we treat them within Onsager theory. Our results\nindicate that depletion effects, and consequently smectic stability, decrease\nsignificantly as a result of orientational disorder in the smectic phase when\ncompared with corresponding data based on the frozen--orientation\napproximation. These results are discussed in terms of the $\\tau$ parameter,\nwhich has been proposed as a convenient measure of depletion strength. We\npresent closed expressions for $\\tau$, and show that it is intimately connected\nwith the depletion potential. We then analyse the effect of particle geometry\nby comparing results pertaining to systems of parallel rods of different shapes\n(spherocylinders, cylinders and parallelepipeds). We finally provide results\nbased on the Zwanzig approximation of a Fundamental--Measure\ndensity--functional theory applied to mixtures of parallelepipeds and cubes of\ndifferent sizes. In this case, we show that the $\\tau$ parameter exhibits a\nlinear asymptotic behaviour in the limit of large values of the hard--rod\naspect ratio, in conformity with Onsager theory, as well as in the limit of\nlarge values of the ratio of rod breadth to cube side length, $d$, in contrast\nto Onsager approximation, which predicts $\\tau\\sim d^3$.\n"}
{"text":"  In this article we analyze the impact of B-physics and Higgs physics at LEP\non standard and non-standard Higgs bosons searches at the Tevatron and the LHC,\nwithin the framework of minimal flavor violating supersymmetric models. The\nB-physics constraints we consider come from the experimental measurements of\nthe rare B-decays b -> s gamma and B_u -> tau nu and the experimental limit on\nthe B_s -> mu+ mu- branching ratio. We show that these constraints are severe\nfor large values of the trilinear soft breaking parameter A_t, rendering the\nnon-standard Higgs searches at hadron colliders less promising. On the contrary\nthese bounds are relaxed for small values of A_t and large values of the\nHiggsino mass parameter mu, enhancing the prospects for the direct detection of\nnon-standard Higgs bosons at both colliders. We also consider the available\nATLAS and CMS projected sensitivities in the standard model Higgs search\nchannels, and we discuss the LHC's ability in probing the whole MSSM parameter\nspace. In addition we also consider the expected Tevatron collider\nsensitivities in the standard model Higgs h -> b bbar channel to show that it\nmay be able to find 3 sigma evidence in the B-physics allowed regions for small\nor moderate values of the stop mixing parameter.\n"}
{"text":"  We argue that the weak coupling regime of a large N gauge theory in the Higgs\nphase contains black hole-like objects. These so-called ``plasma puddles'' are\nmeta-stable lumps of hot plasma lying in locally un-Higgsed regions of space.\nThey decay via O(1\/N) thermal radiation and, perhaps surprisingly, absorb all\nincident matter. We show that an incident particle of energy E striking the\nplasma puddle will shower into an enormous number of decay products whose\nmultiplicity grows linearly with E, and whose average energy is independent of\nE. Once these ultra-soft particles reach the interior they are thermalized by\nthe plasma within, and so the object appears ``black.'' We determine some gross\nproperties like the size and temperature of the the plasma puddle in terms of\nfundamental parameters in the gauge theory. Interestingly, demanding that the\nplasma puddle emit thermal Hawking radiation implies that the object is black\n(i.e. absorbs all incident particles), which implies classical stability, which\nimplies satisfaction of the Bekenstein entropy bound. Because of the AdS\/CFT\nduality and the many similarities between plasma puddles and black holes, we\nconjecture that black objects are a robust feature of quantum gravity.\n"}
{"text":"  We analyze several aspects of the phenomenon of stochastic resonance in\nreaction-diffusion systems, exploiting the nonequilibrium potential's\nframework. The generalization of this formalism (sketched in the appendix) to\nextended systems is first carried out in the context of a simplified scalar\nmodel, for which stationary patterns can be found analytically. We first show\nhow system-size stochastic resonance arises naturally in this framework, and\nthen how the phenomenon of array-enhanced stochastic resonance can be further\nenhanced by letting the diffusion coefficient depend on the field. A yet less\ntrivial generalization is exemplified by a stylized version of the\nFitzHugh-Nagumo system, a paradigm of the activator-inhibitor class. After\ndiscussing for this system the second aspect enumerated above, we derive from\nit -through an adiabatic-like elimination of the inhibitor field- an effective\nscalar model that includes a nonlocal contribution. Studying the role played by\nthe range of the nonlocal kernel and its effect on stochastic resonance, we\nfind an optimal range that maximizes the system's response.\n"}
{"text":"  When a source emits a gravity-wave (GW) pulse over a short period of time,\nthe leading edge of the GW signal is redshifted more than the inner boundary of\nthe pulse. The GW pulse is distorted by the gravitational effect of the\nself-energy residing in between these shells. We illustrate this distortion for\nGW pulses from the final plunge of black hole (BH) binaries, leading to the\nevolution of the GW profile as a function of the radial distance from the\nsource. The distortion depends on the total GW energy released and the duration\nof the emission, scaled by the total binary mass, M. The effect should be\nrelevant in finite box simulations where the waveforms are extracted within a\nradius of <~ 100M. For characteristic emission parameters at the final plunge\nbetween binary BHs of arbitrary spins, this effect could distort the simulated\nGW templates for LIGO and LISA by a fraction of 0.001. Accounting for the wave\ndistortion would significantly decrease the waveform extraction errors in\nnumerical simulations.\n"}
{"text":"  We present ground-based B and R-band color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs),\nreaching the oldest main-sequence turnoffs with good photometric accuracy for\ntwelve fields in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). Our fields, located between\n~1 and ~4 degrees from the center of the galaxy, are situated in different\nparts of the SMC such as the \"Wing'' area, and towards the West and South. In\nthis paper we perform a first analysis of the stellar content in our SMC fields\nthrough comparison with theoretical isochrones and color functions (CFs). We\nfind that the underlying spheroidally distributed population is composed of\nboth intermediate-age and old stars and that its age composition does not show\nstrong galacto-centric gradients. The three fields situated toward the east, in\nthe Wing region, show very active current star formation. However, only in the\neastern field closest to the center do we find an enhancement of recent star\nformation with respect to a constant SFR(t). The fields corresponding to the\nwestern side of the SMC present a much less populated young MS, and the CF\nanalysis indicates that the SFR(t) greatly diminished around 2 Gyr ago in these\nparts. Field smc0057, the closest to the center of the galaxy and located in\nthe southern part, shows recent star formation, while the rest of the southern\nfields present few bright MS stars. The structure of the red clump in all the\nCMDs is consistent with the large amount of intermediate-age stars inferred\nfrom the CMDs and color functions. None of the SMC fields presented here are\ndominated by old stellar populations, a fact that is in agreement with the lack\nof a conspicuous horizontal branch in all these SMC CMDs. This could indicate\nthat a disk population is ruling over a possible old halo in all the observed\nfields.\n"}
{"text":"  I discuss fundamental limits placed on information and information processing\nby gravity. Such limits arise because both information and its processing\nrequire energy, while gravitational collapse (formation of a horizon or black\nhole) restricts the amount of energy allowed in a finite region.

Once\nthe hoop conjecture is assumed a number of results can be obtained directly:\nthe existence of a fundamental uncertainty in spatial distance of order the\nPlanck length, bounds on information (entropy) in a finite region, and a bound\non the rate of information processing in a finite region. In the final section\nI discuss some cosmological issues related to the total amount of information\nin the universe, and note that almost all detailed aspects of the late universe\nare determined by the randomness of quantum outcomes.

{"text":"  The local, uncorrelated multiplicative noises driving a second-order, purely\nnoise-induced, ordering phase transition (NIPT) were assumed to be Gaussian and\nwhite in the model of [Phys.

This task is\nfacilitated if these noises are dynamically generated by means of stochastic\ndifferential equations (SDE) driven by white noises. One such case is that of\nOrnstein--Uhlenbeck noises which are stationary, with Gaussian pdf and a\nvariance reduced by the self-correlation time (\\tau), and whose effect on the\nNIPT phase diagram has been studied some time ago. Another such case is when\nthe stationary pdf is a (colored) Tsallis' (q)--\\emph{Gaussian} which, being a\n\\emph{fat-tail} distribution for (q>1) and a \\emph{compact-support} one for\n(q<1), allows for a controlled exploration of the effects of the departure from\nGaussian statistics.

Even for relatively small (\\tau), it is shown that\nwhereas fat-tail noise distributions ((q>1)) counteract the effect of\nself-correlation, compact-support ones ((q<1)) enhance it. Also, an interesting\neffect on the susceptibility is seen in the last case.\n"}

Eighteen remnant\ncandidates are analyzed by means of photometric and proper motion data. These\ndata provide information on objects and their fields. We establish criteria for\ncharacterizing open cluster remnants, taking observational uncertainties into\naccount. 2MASS J and H photometry is employed (i) to study structural\nproperties of the objects by means of radial stellar density profiles, (ii) to\ntest for any similarity between objects and fields with a statistical\ncomparison method applied to the distributions of stars in the CMDs, and (iii)\nto obtain ages, reddening values, and distances from the CMD, taking an index\nof isochrone fit into account. The UCAC2 proper motions allowed an objective\ncomparison between objects and large solid angle offset fields. The objective\nanalysis based on the present methods indicates 13 open-cluster remnants in the\nsample. Evidence of the presence of binary stars is found, as expected for\ndynamically evolved systems. Finally, we infer possible evolutionary stages\namong remnants from the structure, proper motion, and CMD distributions.

{"text":"  Using a widely used stellar population synthesis model, we study the ability\nof using pairs of AB system colours to break the well-known stellar\nage--metallicity degeneracy and give constraints on the two stellar-population\nparameters (age and metallicity).

Our results suggest that a few pairs of colours can be\nused to constrain the two above stellar-population parameters.

In\ndetail, colour pairs [(r-K), (u-R)] and [(r-K), (u-r)] are shown to be the best\npairs for estimating stellar ages and metallicities.

{"text":"  We study the possibility that the mutual interactions between Jupiter and\nSaturn prevented Type II migration from driving these planets much closer to\nthe Sun.

Initially both planets migrate towards the Sun, and\nSaturn's migration tends to be faster. As a consequence, they eventually end up\nlocked in a mean motion resonance. If this happens in the 2:3 resonance, the\nresonant motion is particularly stable, and the gaps opened by the planets in\nthe disk may overlap. This causes a drastic change in the torque balance for\nthe two planets, which substantially slows down the planets' inward migration.\nIf the gap overlap is substantial, planet migration may even be stopped or\nreversed. As the widths of the gaps depend on disk viscosity and scale height,\nthis mechanism is particularly efficient in low viscosity, cool disks.

{"text":"  Six of the eight double neutron stars known in the Galactic disk have low\norbital eccentricities (< 0.27) indicating that their second-born neutron stars\nreceived only very small velocity kicks at birth.

{"text":"  In this paper, we present a new implementation of feedback due to active\ngalactic nuclei (AGN) in cosmological simulations of galaxy formation. We\nassume that a fraction of jet energy, which is generated by an AGN, is\ntransferred to the surrounding gas as thermal energy. Combining a theoretical\nmodel of mass accretion onto black holes with a multiphase description of\nstar-forming gas, we self-consistently follow evolution of both galaxies and\ntheir central black holes. The novelty in our model is that we consider two\ndistinct accretion modes: standard radiatively efficient thin accretion disks\nand radiatively inefficient accretion flows which we will generically refer to\nas RIAFs; motivated by theoretical models for jet production in accretion\ndisks, we assume that only the RIAF is responsible for the AGN feedback. We\nfind that, after an initial episode of bursting star formation, the accretion\nrate onto the central black hole drops so that the accretion disk switches to a\nRIAF structure. At this point, the feedback from the AGN becomes efficient and\nslightly suppresses star formation in the galactic disk and almost completely\nhalts star formation in the bulge. As a result, the nucleus becomes a\nstochastically fuelled low-luminosity AGN (Seyfert galaxy) with recurrent\nshort-lived episodes of activity after the star bursts. Our model predicts\nseveral properties of the low-luminosity AGN including the bolometric\nluminosity, jet powers, the effect on kpc-scale of the radio jet and the AGN\nlifetime, which are in broad agreement with observations of Seyfert galaxies\nand their radio activity.

The systemic\nvelocity inferred from the optically thin lines agrees within 3km\/s with the\ncentral velocity of the maser emission for most of the sources. About 64% of\nthe sources show line wings in one or more transitions of CO, HCO^+ and CS\nspecies, indicating the presence of molecular outflows. Comparison of the\nwidths of line wings and methanol maser emission suggests that the 6.7GHz maser\nline traces the environment of MYSO of various kinematic regimes. Therefore\nconditions conducive for the methanol maser can exist in the inner parts of\nmolecular clouds or circumstellar discs as well as in the outer parts\nassociated with molecular outflows. Calculations of the physical conditions\nbased on the CO and HCO^+ lines and the CS line intensity ratios refine the\ninput parameters for maser models.\n"}

Only 7 out of 29 resolved mm cores (and 16 out of the 26\nunresolved ones) do not exhibit signposts of star formation activity. The other\nones are clearly associated with: far-IR sources, H_2 jets or near-IR objects\nshowing a high intrinsic colour excess. The distribution of the spectral\nindices pertaining to the associated sources is peaked at values typical of\nClass I objects, while three objects are signalled as candidates Class 0\nsources. We remark the high detection rate (30%) of H_2 jets driven by sources\nlocated inside the mm-cores. They appear not driven by the most luminous\nobjects in the field, but rather by less luminous objects in young clusters,\ntestifying the co-existence of both low- and intermediate-mass star formation.\nThe presented results reliably describe the young population of VMR-D. However,\nthe statistical evaluation of activity vs inactivity of the investigated cores,\neven in good agreement with results found for other star forming regions, seems\nto reflect the limiting sensitivity of the available facilities rather than any\nproperty intrinsic to the mm-condensations.\n"}

The spectrum of HR 4049 appears principally in emission\nthrough the 3 and 4.6 micron region and in absorption in the 2 micron region.\nThe 4.6 micron spectrum shows a rich 'forest' of emission lines. All the\nspectral lines observed in the 2.3-4.6 micron spectrum are shown to be\ncircumbinary in origin. The presence of OH and H2O lines confirm the\noxygen-rich nature of the circumbinary gas which is in contrast to the\npreviously detected carbon-rich material. The emission and absorption line\nprofiles show that the circumbinary gas is located in a thin, rotating layer\nnear the dust disk. The properties of the dust and gas circumbinary disk and\nthe spectroscopic orbit yield masses for the individual stars, M_AI~0.58 Msolar\nand M_MV~0.34 Msolar.

We serendipitously detected SO$_2$ towards\n17 sources in the same tuning as HCO$^+$. We detected HCO$^+$ towards all\nsources, and suggest that it is tracing infall in nine cases.

{"text":"  The Standard Model indicates the realization of grand unified structures in\nnature, and can only be viewed as an effective theory below a higher energy\ncutoff. While the renormalizable Standard Model forbids proton decay mediating\noperators due to accidental global symmetries, many extensions of the Standard\nModel introduce such dimension four, five and six operators. Furthermore,\nquantum gravity effects are expected to induce proton instability, indicating\nthat the higher energy cutoff scale must be above 10^{16}GeV. Quasi-realistic\nheterotic string models provide the arena to explore how perturbative quantum\ngravity affects the particle physics phenomenology. An appealing explanation\nfor the proton longevity is provided by the existence of an Abelian gauge\nsymmetry that suppresses the proton decay mediating operators. Additionally,\nsuch a low-scale U(1) symmetry should: allow the suppression of the left-handed\nneutrino masses by a seesaw mechanism; allow fermion Yukawa couplings to the\nelectroweak Higgs doublets; be anomaly free; be family universal.

Afterward, the\nspace of solutions condenses over a finite number of the largest states and\nconsequently the total entropy of solutions becomes smaller than the annealed\none. Another transition takes place when in all the entropically dominant\nstates a finite fraction of nodes freezes so that each of these nodes is\nallowed a single color in all the solutions inside the state.

{"text":"  This paper uncovers and explores the close relationship between Monte Carlo\nOptimization of a parametrized integral (MCO), Parametric machine-Learning\n(PL), and `blackbox' or `oracle'-based optimization (BO).

This identity potentially provides a new application\ndomain for all broadly applicable PL techniques: MCO. Second, we introduce\nimmediate sampling, a new version of the Probability Collectives (PC) algorithm\nfor blackbox optimization. Immediate sampling transforms the original BO\nproblem into an MCO problem. Accordingly, by combining these first two\ncontributions, we can apply all PL techniques to BO. In our third contribution\nwe validate this way of improving BO by demonstrating that cross-validation and\nbagging improve immediate sampling. Finally, conventional MC and MCO procedures\nignore the relationship between the sample point locations and the associated\nvalues of the integrand; only the values of the integrand at those locations\nare considered.

[abridged] Relative to\nnonrotating stars of the same mass, these models all have reduced luminosities\nand effective temperatures, and flattened photospheric shapes (i.e., decreased\npolar radii) with equatorial radii that can be larger or smaller, depending on\nthe degree of differential rotation. For a fixed ratio of the axial rotation\nrate to the surface equatorial rotation rate, increasingly rapid rotation\ngenerally deepens convective envelopes, shrinks convective cores, and can lead\nto the presence of a convective core (envelope) in a 1 M_sun (2 M_sun) model, a\nfeature that is absent in a nonrotating star of the same mass.

{"text":"  During accretion a neutron star (NS) is spun up as angular momentum is\ntransported through its surface layers.

The\nradial and azimuthal magnetic field components have strengths of ~10^5 G and\n~10^10 G, respectively. This leads to nearly uniform rotation at the depths of\ninterest for X-ray bursts. A remaining small shear transmits the accreted\nangular momentum inward to the NS interior. Though this shear gives little\nviscous heating, it can trigger turbulent mixing. Detailed simulations will be\nrequired to fully understand the consequences of mixing, but our models\nillustrate some general features. Mixing has the greatest impact when the\nbuoyancy at the compositional discontinuity between accreted matter and ashes\nis overcome. This occurs at high accretion rates, at low spin frequencies, or\nmay depend on the ashes from the previous burst. We then find two new regimes\nof burning. The first is ignition in a layer containing a mixture of heavier\nelements from the ashes. If ignition occurs at the base of the mixed layer,\nrecurrence times as short as ~5-30 minutes are possible. This may explain the\nshort recurrence time of some bursts, but incomplete burning is still needed to\nexplain these bursts' energetics. When mixing is sufficiently strong, a second\nregime is found where accreted helium mixes deep enough to burn stably,\nquenching X-ray bursts. We speculate that the observed change in X-ray burst\nproperties near one-tenth the Eddington accretion rate is from this mechanism.\nThe carbon-rich material produced by stable helium burning would be important\nfor triggering and fueling superbursts.

{"text":"  Aims: We present a photometric study of the deeply eclipsing SW Sex-type\nnova-like cataclysmic variable star BH Lyn\n  Methods: Time-resolved V-band CCD photometry was obtained for seven nights\nbetween 1999 and 2004.\n  Results: We determined 11 new eclipse timings of BH Lyn and derived a refined\norbital ephemeris with an orbital period of 0.155875577(14) day. During the\nobservations, BH Lyn was in high-state with V~15.5 mag. The star presents ~1.5\nmag deep eclipses with mean full-width at half-flux of 0.0683(+\/-0.0054)P_orb.\n  The eclipse shape is highly variable, even changing form cycle to cycle. This\nis most likely due to accretion disc surface brightness distribution\nvariations, most probably caused by strong flickering. Time-dependent accretion\ndisc self-occultation or variations of the hot spot(s) intensity are also\npossible explanations. Negative superhumps with period of ~0.145 day are\ndetected in two long runs in 2000. A possible connection between SW Sex and\nnegative superhump phenomena through the presence of tilted accretion disc is\ndiscussed, and a way to observationally test this is suggested.\n"}
{"text":"  A multiple antenna downlink channel where limited channel feedback is\navailable to the transmitter is considered. In a vector downlink channel\n(single antenna at each receiver), the transmit antenna array can be used to\ntransmit separate data streams to multiple receivers only if the transmitter\nhas very accurate channel knowledge, i.e., if there is high-rate channel\nfeedback from each receiver. In this work it is shown that channel feedback\nrequirements can be significantly reduced if each receiver has a small number\nof antennas and appropriately combines its antenna outputs. A combining method\nthat minimizes channel quantization error at each receiver, and thereby\nminimizes multi-user interference, is proposed and analyzed. This technique is\nshown to outperform traditional techniques such as maximum-ratio combining\nbecause minimization of interference power is more critical than maximization\nof signal power in the multiple antenna downlink. Analysis is provided to\nquantify the feedback savings, and the technique is seen to work well with user\nselection and is also robust to receiver estimation error.\n"}
{"text":"  We consider a system of d non-linear stochastic heat equations in spatial\ndimension 1 driven by d-dimensional space-time white noise. The non-linearities\nappear both as additive drift terms and as multipliers of the noise. Using\ntechniques of Malliavin calculus, we establish upper and lower bounds on the\none-point density of the solution u(t,x), and upper bounds of Gaussian-type on\nthe two-point density of (u(s,y),u(t,x)). In particular, this estimate\nquantifies how this density degenerates as (s,y) converges to (t,x). From these\nresults, we deduce upper and lower bounds on hitting probabilities of the\nprocess {u(t,x)}_{t \\in \\mathbb{R}_+, x \\in [0,1]}, in terms of respectively\nHausdorff measure and Newtonian capacity. These estimates make it possible to\nshow that points are polar when d >6 and are not polar when d<6.

HI emission at a velocity of -117\nkm\/s towards the sightline HD 30677 with NHI=1.7x10^19 cm-2 has no\ncorresponding CaII K absorption, which has a signal-to-noise (S\/N) ratio of\n610.

The CaII K spectrum has a S\/N = 780, although no absorption is observed\nat the cloud velocity. This similarly places a firm lower distance limit of\n2.9-kpc towards this parcel of gas that may be an intermediate velocity cloud.\nThe lack of intermediate velocity (IV) CaII K absorption towards HD 196426 at a\nS\/N = 500 reinforces a lower distance limit of 700-pc towards this part of\nComplex gp, where NHI is 1.1x10^19 cm-2 and velocity is +78 km\/s. Additionally,\nno IV CaII K is seen in absorption in the spectrum of HD 19445, which is strong\nin HI with NHI=8x10^19 cm-2 at -42 km\/s, placing a firm although uninteresting\nlower distance limit of 39-pc to this part of IV South.

{"text":"  We present a deep photometric survey of M31, conducted with the CFHT and INT,\ncovering the inner 50 kpc of the galaxy, the Southern quadrant out to 150 kpc,\nand extending to M33. This is the first systematic panoramic study of this very\noutermost region of galaxies. We detect several streams and other large-scale\nstructures, and two new dwarf galaxies: And XV and XVI. The discovery of\nsubstructure on the minor axis, together with the fact that the light profile\nbetween 0.5 < R < 1.3 follows the exponential ``extended disk'', is\nparticularly important in shedding light on the mixed and sometimes conflicting\nresults reported in previous studies. Underlying the substructures lies a\nfaint, metal-poor, smooth and extremely extended halo, reaching out to at least\n150 kpc. The smooth halo component in M31 has a profile that can be fit with a\nHernquist model of immense scale radius ~55 kpc, almost a factor of 4 larger\nthan theoretical predictions. Alternatively a power-law with exponent -1.91 +\/-\n0.11 can be fit to the profile. The total luminosity of this structure is\nsimilar to that of the halo of the Milky Way. This vast, smooth, underlying\nhalo is reminiscent of a classical monolithic model and completely unexpected\nfrom modern galaxy formation models. M33 is also found to have an extended\nmetal-poor halo component, which can be fit with a Hernquist model also of\nscale radius ~55 kpc. These extended slowly-decreasing halos will provide a\nchallenge and strong constraints for further modeling. [Abridged]\n"}
{"text":"  One of the goals of the landscape program in string theory is to extract\ninformation about the space of string vacua in the form of statistical\ncorrelations between phenomenological features that are otherwise uncorrelated\nin field theory. Such correlations would thus represent predictions of string\ntheory that hold independently of a vacuum-selection principle. In this paper,\nwe study statistical correlations between two features which are likely to be\ncentral to any potential description of nature at high energy scales: gauge\nsymmetries and spacetime supersymmetry. We analyze correlations between these\ntwo kinds of symmetry within the context of perturbative heterotic string\nvacua, and find a number of striking features. We find, for example, that the\ndegree of spacetime supersymmetry is strongly correlated with the probabilities\nof realizing certain gauge groups, with unbroken supersymmetry at the string\nscale tending to favor gauge-group factors with larger rank. We also find that\nnearly half of the heterotic landscape is non-supersymmetric and yet\ntachyon-free at tree level; indeed, less than a quarter of the tree-level\nheterotic landscape exhibits any supersymmetry at all at the string scale.\n"}
{"text":"  If the supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the center of our Galaxy grew\nadiabatically, then a dense \"spike\" of dark matter is expected to have formed\naround it. Assuming that dark matter is composed primarily of weakly\ninteracting massive particles (WIMPs), a star orbiting close enough to the SMBH\ncan capture WIMPs at an extremely high rate. The stellar luminosity due to\nannihilation of captured WIMPs in the stellar core may be comparable to or even\nexceed the luminosity of the star due to thermonuclear burning. The model thus\npredicts the existence of unusual stars, i.e. \"WIMP burners\", in the vicinity\nof an adiabatically grown SMBH. We find that the most efficient WIMP burners\nare stars with degenerate electron cores, e.g. white dwarfs (WD) or degenerate\ncores with envelopes. If found, such stars would provide evidence for the\nexistence of particle dark matter and could possibly be used to establish its\ndensity profile. In our previous paper we computed the luminosity from WIMP\nburning for a range of dark matter spike density profiles, degenerate core\nmasses, and distances from the SMBH. Here we compare our results with the\nobserved stars closest to the Galactic center and find that they could be\nconsistent with WIMP burners in the form of degenerate cores with envelopes. We\nalso cross-check the WIMP burner hypothesis with the EGRET observed flux of\ngamma-rays from the Galactic center, which imposes a constraint on the dark\nmatter spike density profile and annihilation cross-section. We find that the\nEGRET data is consistent with the WIMP burner hypothesis. New high precision\nmeasurements by GLAST will confirm or set stringent limits on a dark matter\nspike at the Galactic center, which will in turn support or set stringent\nlimits on the existence of WIMP burners at the Galactic center.\n"}

Our results suggest that the high\nenergy emission is dominated by the leptonic component if fraction of shock\nenergy carried by electrons is not very small (e.g. $\\epsilon_e > 10^{-3}$).\nFor very small values of $\\epsilon_e$ the hadronic emission component could be\ncomparable to or even exceed the leptonic component in the GeV-TeV regime.\nHowever, in this case a much larger energy budget of the fireball is required\nto account for the same level of the observed sub-MeV spectrum.

{"text":"  We present results of a photometric survey whose aim was to derive structural\nand astrophysical parameters for 42 open clusters. While our sample is\ndefinitively not representative of the total open cluster sample in the Galaxy,\nit does cover a wide range of cluster parameters and is uniform enough to allow\nfor simple statistical considerations. BV wide-field CCD photometry was\nobtained for open clusters for which photometric, structural, and dynamical\nevolution parameters were determined. The limiting and core radii were\ndetermined by analyzing radial density profiles. The ages, reddenings, and\ndistances were obtained from the solar metallicity isochrone fitting. The mass\nfunction was used to study the dynamical state of the systems, mass segregation\neffect and to estimate the total mass and number of cluster members. This study\nreports on the first determination of basic parameters for 11 out of 42\nobserved open clusters. The angular sizes for the majority of the observed\nclusters appear to be several times larger than the catalogue data indicate.\nThe core and limiting cluster radii are correlated and the latter parameter is\n3.2 times larger on average. The limiting radius increases with the cluster's\nmass, and both the limiting and core radii decrease in the course of dynamical\nevolution. For dynamically not advanced clusters, the mass function slope is\nsimilar to the universal IMF slope. For more evolved systems, the effect of\nevaporation of low-mass members is clearly visible. The initial mass\nsegregation is present in all the observed young clusters, whereas the\ndynamical mass segregation appears in clusters older than about log(age)=8.\nLow-mass stars are deficient in the cores of clusters older than log(age)=8.5\nand not younger than one relaxation time.\n"}

{"text":"  It has been shown that, for the two-qubit Heisenberg XY model, anisotropy and\nmagnetic field may together be used to produce entanglement for any finite\ntemperature by adjusting the external magnetic field beyond some finite\ncritical strength. This interesting result arises from an analysis employing\nthe Wootters concurrence, a computable measure of entanglement for two-qubit\nstates. Recently, Mintert {\\em et al.} proposed generalizations of Wootters\nconcurrence for multipartite states. These MKB concurrences possess a\nmathematical property that enables one to understand the origin of this\ncharacteristic behavior.

In two cases there is\nunambiguous kinematic evidence for stellar disks on these scales. In the\nnuclear regions there appear to have been recent - but no longer active -\nstarbursts in the last 10-300Myr. The stellar luminosity is less than a few\npercent of the AGN in the central 10pc, whereas on kiloparsec scales the\nluminosities are comparable. The surface stellar luminosity density follows a\nsimilar trend in all the objects, increasing steadily at smaller radii up to\n10^{13}L_sun\/kpc^2 in the central few parsecs, where the mass surface density\nexceeds 10^4M_sun\/pc^2.

{"text":"  To use galaxy clusters as a cosmological probe, it is important to account\nfor their triaxiality.

We examine the validity of this reconstruction\nalgorithm by performing an observational test of it with the Virgo cluster as a\ntarget. We first modify the LK06 algorithm by incorporating the two dimensional\nprojection effect. Then, we analyze the 1275 member galaxies from the Virgo\nCluster Catalogue and find the projected direction of the Virgo cluster major\naxis by measuring the anisotropy in the spatial distribution of the member\ngalaxies in the two dimensional projected plane.

The crack surfaces are rough on the scale of\nthe clusters, but exhibit constant average heights for orientations\nperpendicular to high symmetry axes. From detailed analyses of the fractured\nsamples we conclude that both, the plane structure and the clusters, strongly\ninfluence dynamic fracture in quasicrystals and that the clusters therefore\nhave to be regarded as physical entities.\n"}
{"text":"  The paper is considering an opportunity for the CERN\/GranSasso (CNGS)\nneutrino complex, concurrent time-wise with T2K and NOvA, to search for\ntheta_13 oscillations and CP violation. Compared with large water Cherenkov\n(T2K) and fine grained scintillators (NOvA), the LAr-TPC offers a higher\ndetection efficiency and a lower backgrounds, since virtually all channels may\nbe unambiguously recognized. The present proposal, called MODULAr, describes a\n20 kt fiducial volume LAr-TPC, following very closely the technology developed\nfor the ICARUS-T60o, and is focused on the following activities, for which we\nseek an extended international collaboration:\n  (1) the neutrino beam from the CERN 400 GeV proton beam and an optimised horn\nfocussing, eventually with an increased intensity in the framework of the LHC\naccelerator improvement program;\n  (2) A new experimental area LNGS-B, of at least 50000 m3 at 10 km off-axis\nfrom the main Laboratory, eventually upgradable to larger sizes. A location is\nunder consideration at about 1.2 km equivalent water depth;\n  (3) A new LAr Imaging detector of at least 20 kt fiducial mass. Such an\nincrease in the volume over the current ICARUS T600 needs to be carefully\nconsidered. It is concluded that a very large mass is best realised with a set\nof many identical, independent units, each of 5 kt, \"cloning\" the technology of\nthe T600.

{"text":"  Abridged... Blue stragglers (BSS) are thought to be the product of either\nprimordial or collisional binary systems. In the context of dwarf spheroidal\ngalaxies it is hard to firmly disentangle a genuine BSS population from young\nmain sequence (MS) stars tracing a ~1-2 Gyr old star forming episode. Assuming\nthat their blue plume populations are made of BSS, we estimate the BSS\nfrequency for 8 Local Group non star-forming dwarf galaxies, using a\ncompilation of ground and space based photometry.\n  Our results can be summarized as follows: (i) The BSS frequency in dwarf\ngalaxies, at any given Mv, is always higher than that in globular clusters of\nsimilar luminosities; (ii) the BSS frequency for the lowest luminosity dwarf\ngalaxies is in excellent agreement with that observed in the Milky Way halo;\nand most interestingly (iii) derive a statistically significant\nanti-correlation between the BSS frequency and the galaxy Mv.\n  The low density, almost collision-less, environments of our dwarf galaxy\nsample allow us to infer (i) their very low dynamical evolution; (ii) a\nnegligible production of collisional BSS; and consequently (iii) that their\nblue plumes are mainly made of primordial binaries. The dwarf galaxies\nanti-correlation can be used as a discriminator: galaxies obeying the\nanti-correlation are more likely to possess genuine primordial BSS rather than\nyoung main sequence stars.\n"}

In the classical limit, it exhibits two\nkinds of ground states: a ferrimagnetic state for J\/J' < 1\/2 and a large\nmanifold of canted spin states for J\/J' > 1\/2. To include quantum effects\nself-consistently, we investigate the Sp(N) symmetric generalisation of the\noriginal SU(2) symmetric model in the large-N limit. In addition to the\ndependence on the anisotropy, the Sp(N) symmetric model depends on a parameter\nkappa that measures the importance of quantum effects. Our numerical\ncalculations reveal that in the kappa-J\/J' plane, the system shows a rich phase\ndiagram containing a ferrimagnetic phase, an incommensurate phase, and a\ndecoupled chain phase, the latter two with short- and long-range order. We\ncorroborate these results by showing that the boundaries between the various\nphases and several other features of the Sp(N) phase diagram can be determined\nby analytical calculations. Finally, the application of a block-spin\nperturbation expansion to the trimerised version of the original spin-1\/2 model\nleads us to suggest that in the limit of strong anisotropy, J\/J' >> 1, the\nground state of the original model is a collinearly ordered antiferromagnet,\nwhich is separated from the incommensurate state by a quantum phase transition.\n"}

{"text":"  In most theories of gravity involving torsion, the source for torsion is the\nintrinsic spin of matter. Since the spins of fermions are normally randomly\noriented in macroscopic bodies, the torsion generated is normally negligible.\nHowever, in a recent paper, Mao et al. point out that there is a class of\ntheories in which the angular momentum of macroscopic spinning bodies generates\na significant amount of torsion. They argue that by the principle of action\nequals reaction, one would expect the angular momentum of test bodies to couple\nto a background torsion field, and therefore the precession of the GPB\ngyroscopes should be affected in these theories by the torsion generated by the\nEarth. We show that in fact the principle of action equals reaction does not\napply to these theories. We examine in detail a generalization of the\nHayashi-Shirafuji theory suggested by Mao et al. called\nEinstein-Hayashi-Shirafuji theory. There are a variety of different versions of\nthis theory, depending on the precise form of the coupling to matter chosen for\nthe torsion. We show that for any coupling to matter that is compatible with\nthe spin transport equation postulated by Mao et al., the theory has either\nghosts or an ill-posed initial value formulation. These theoretical problems\ncan be avoided by specializing the parameters of the theory and in addition\nchoosing the standard minimal coupling to matter of the torsion tensor. This\nyields a consistent theory, but one in which the action equals reaction\nprinciple is violated, and in which the angular momentum of the gyroscopes does\nnot couple to the Earth's torsion field. Thus, the Einstein-Hayashi-Shirafuji\ntheory does not predict a detectable torsion signal for Gravity Probe B. There\nmay be other torsion theories which do.\n"}

The average and the dispersion\n(1 $\\sigma$ rms) of these three CTEs are 0.816 and 0.002 ($\\times 10^{-6}$\/K),\nrespectively. No significant difference was detected in the CTE of the three\nsamples from the different lots. Neither inhomogeneity nor anisotropy of the\nCTE was observed.

The peak line\nemissivities of the photons in the post-shock flow are taken into consideration\nand frequency shifts due to Doppler effects are also included. We find that\nline profiles are most distorted by Compton scattering effects in strongly\nmagnetized mCVs with a low white dwarf mass and high mass accretion rate and\nwhich are viewed at an oblique angle with respect to the accretion column.

{"text":"  (Abridged) We use 3D SPH calculations with higher resolution, as well as with\nmore realistic viscosity and sound-speed prescriptions than previous work to\nexamine the eccentric instability which underlies the superhump phenomenon in\nsemi-detached binaries. We illustrate the importance of the two-armed spiral\nmode in the generation of superhumps. Differential motions in the fluid disc\ncause converging flows which lead to strong spiral shocks once each superhump\ncycle. The dissipation associated with these shocks powers the superhump. We\ncompare 2D and 3D results, and conclude that 3D simulations are necessary to\nfaithfully simulate the disc dynamics. We ran our simulations for unprecedented\ndurations, so that an eccentric equilibrium is established except at high mass\nratios where the growth rate of the instability is very low. Our improved\nsimulations give a closer match to the observed relationship between superhump\nperiod excess and binary mass ratio than previous numerical work. The observed\nblack hole X-ray transient superhumpers appear to have systematically lower\ndisc precession rates than the cataclysmic variables. This could be due to\nhigher disc temperatures and thicknesses. The modulation in total viscous\ndissipation on the superhump period is overwhelmingly from the region of the\ndisc within the 3:1 resonance radius. As the eccentric instability develops,\nthe viscous torques are enhanced, and the disc consequently adjusts to a new\nequilibrium state, as suggested in the thermal-tidal instability model. We\nquantify this enhancement in the viscosity, which is ~10 per cent for q=0.08.\nWe characterise the eccentricity distributions in our accretion discs, and show\nthat the entire body of the disc partakes in the eccentricity.\n"}

{"text":"  An interaction between electrons and lattice vibrations (phonons) results in\ntwo fundamental quantum phenomena in solids: in three dimensions it can turn a\nmetal into a superconductor whereas in one dimension it can turn a metal into\nan insulator.

{"text":"  Context. One of the typical features shown by observations of solar\nprominence oscillations is that they are damped in time and that the values of\nthe damping times are usually between one and three times the corresponding\noscillatory period. However, the mechanism responsible for the attenuation is\nstill not well-known. Aims. Thermal conduction, optically thin or thick\nradiation and heating are taken into account in the energy equation, and their\nrole on the attenuation of prominence oscillations is evaluated. Methods. The\ndispersion relation for linear non-adiabatic magnetoacoustic waves is derived\nconsidering an equilibrium made of a prominence plasma slab embedded in an\nunbounded corona. The magnetic field is orientated along the direction parallel\nto the slab axis and has the same strength in all regions. By solving the\ndispersion relation for a fixed wavenumber, a complex oscillatory frequency is\nobtained, and the period and the damping time are computed. Results. The effect\nof conduction and radiation losses is different for each magnetoacoustic mode\nand depends on the wavenumber. In the observed range of wavelengths the\ninternal slow mode is attenuated by radiation from the prominence plasma, the\nfast mode by the combination of prominence radiation and coronal conduction and\nthe external slow mode by coronal conduction. The consideration of the external\ncorona is of paramount importance in the case of the fast and external slow\nmodes, whereas it does not affect the internal slow modes at all.

We find a decline with\nredshift of the overall number density of galaxies for all masses (59+-5% for\nM>10^8 Msun at z=1), and a mild mass-dependent average evolution\n(`mass-downsizing'). In particular our data are consistent with mild\/negligible\n(<30%) evolution up to z=0.7 for massive galaxies (>6x10^10 Msun). For less\nmassive systems the no-evolution scenario is excluded. A large fraction (>=50%)\nof massive galaxies have been already assembled and converted most of their gas\ninto stars at z=1, ruling out the `dry mergers' as the major mechanism of their\nassembly history below z=1. This fraction decreases to 33% at z=2. Low-mass\nsystems have decreased continuously in number and mass density (by a factor up\nto 4) from the present age to z=2, consistently with a prolonged mass assembly\nalso at z<1.\n"}
{"text":"  Linear polarization in X- and gamma-rays is an important diagnostic of many\nastrophysical sources, foremost giving information about their geometry,\nmagnetic fields, and radiation mechanisms. However, very few X-ray polarization\nmeasurements have been made, and then only mono-energetic detections, whilst\nseveral objects are assumed to have energy dependent polarization signatures.\nIn this paper we investigate whether detection of energy dependent polarization\nfrom cosmic sources is possible using the Compton technique, in particular with\nthe proposed PoGOLite balloon-experiment, in the 25-100 keV range. We use\nGeant4 simulations of a PoGOLite model and input photon spectra based on Cygnus\nX-1 and accreting magnetic pulsars (100 mCrab). Effective observing times of 6\nand 35 hours were simulated, corresponding to a standard and a long duration\nflight respectively. Both smooth and sharp energy variations of the\npolarization are investigated and compared to constant polarization signals\nusing chi-square statistics. We can reject constant polarization, with energy,\nfor the Cygnus X-1 spectrum (in the hard state), if the reflected component is\nassumed to be completely polarized, whereas the distinction cannot be made for\nweaker polarization. For the accreting pulsar, constant polarization can be\nrejected in the case of polarization in a narrow energy band with at least 50%\npolarization, and similarly for a negative step distribution from 30% to 0%\npolarization.\n"}

Many\nother telescopes, including Konus-Wind, XMM-Newton, ROTSE and the Faulkes\nTelescope North, also observed the burst. The gamma-ray, X-ray and UV\/optical\nemission all showed a peak ~75s after the trigger, although the optical and\nX-ray afterglow components also appear early on - before, or during, the main\npeak. Spectral evolution was seen throughout the burst, with the prompt\nemission showing a clear positive correlation between brightness and hardness.\nThe Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) of the prompt emission, stretching from\n1eV up to 1MeV, is very flat, with a peak in the flux density at ~1keV. The\noptical-to-X-ray spectra at this time are better fitted by a broken, rather\nthan single, power-law, similar to previous results for X-ray flares. The SED\nshows spectral hardening as the afterglow evolves with time. This behaviour\nmight be a symptom of self-Comptonisation, although circumstellar densities\nsimilar to those found in the cores of molecular clouds would be required. The\nafterglow also decays too slowly to be accounted for by the standard models.\nAlthough the precursor and main emission show different spectral lags, both are\nconsistent with the lag-luminosity correlation for long bursts. GRB 061121 is\nthe instantaneously brightest long burst yet detected by Swift. Using a\ncombination of Swift and Konus-Wind data, we estimate an isotropic energy of\n2.8x10^53 erg over 1keV - 10MeV in the GRB rest frame.

{"text":"  The focusing performance of X-ray optics (conveniently expressed in terms of\nHEW, Half Energy Width) strongly depend on both mirrors deformations and photon\nscattering caused by the microroughness of reflecting surfaces. In particular,\nthe contribution of X-ray Scattering (XRS) to the HEW of the optic is usually\nan increasing function H(E) of the photon energy E. Therefore, in future hard\nX-ray imaging telescopes of the future (SIMBOL-X, NeXT, Constellation-X, XEUS),\nthe X-ray scattering could be the dominant problem since they will operate also\nin the hard X-ray band (i.e. beyond 10 keV). [...]\n  Several methods were proposed in the past years to estimate the scattering\ncontribution to the HEW, dealing with the surface microroughness expressed in\nterms of its Power Spectral Density (PSD), on the basis of the well-established\ntheory of X-ray scattering from rough surfaces. We faced that problem on the\nbasis on the same theory, but we tried a new approach: the direct, analytical\ntranslation of a given surface roughness PSD into a H(E) trend, and - vice\nversa - the direct translation of a H(E) requirement into a surface PSD. This\nPSD represents the maximum tolerable microroughness level in order to meet the\nH(E) requirement in the energy band of a given X-ray telescope.\n  We have thereby found a new, analytical and widely applicable formalism to\ncompute the XRS contribution to the HEW from the surface PSD, provided that the\nPSD had been measured in a wide range of spatial frequencies. The inverse\nproblem was also solved, allowing the immediate evaluation of the mirror\nsurface PSD from a measured function H(E). The same formalism allows\nestablishing the maximum allowed PSD of the mirror in order to fulfill a given\nH(E) requirement. [...]\n"}

{"text":"  Planetary topography can either be modeled as a load supported by the\nlithosphere, or as a dynamical effect due to lithospheric flexure caused by\nmantle convection. In both cases the response of the lithosphere to external\nforces can be calculated with the theory of thin elastic plates or shells. On\none-plate planets the spherical geometry of the lithospheric shell plays an\nimportant role in the flexure mechanism. So far the equations governing the\ndeformations and stresses of a spherical shell have only been derived under the\nassumption of a shell of constant thickness. However local studies of gravity\nand topography data suggest large variations in the thickness of the\nlithosphere. In this article we obtain the scalar flexure equations governing\nthe deformations of a thin spherical shell with variable thickness or variable\nYoung's modulus. The resulting equations can be solved in succession, except\nfor a system of two simultaneous equations, the solutions of which are the\ntransverse deflection and an associated stress function. In order to include\nbottom loading generated by mantle convection, we extend the method of stress\nfunctions to include loads with a toroidal tangential component. We further\nshow that toroidal tangential displacement always occurs if the shell thickness\nvaries, even in the absence of toroidal loads. We finally prove that the\ndegree-one harmonic components of the transverse deflection and of the toroidal\ntangential displacement are independent of the elastic properties of the shell\nand are associated with translational and rotational freedom. The flexure\nequations for a shell of variable thickness are useful not only for the\nprediction of the gravity signal in local admittance studies, but also for the\nconstruction of stress maps in tectonic analysis.\n"}

We advocate an alternative hypothesis,\nthat the Solar System's protoplanetary disk had already formed when a very\nclose (< 1 pc) supernova injected radioactive material directly into the disk.\nWe conduct the first numerical simulations designed to answer two questions\nrelated to this hypothesis: will the disk be destroyed by such a close\nsupernova; and will any of the ejecta be mixed into the disk? Our simulations\ndemonstrate that the disk does not absorb enough momentum from the shock to\nescape the protostar to which it is bound. Only low amounts (< 1%) of mass loss\noccur, due to stripping by Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities across the top of the\ndisk, which also mix into the disk about 1% of the intercepted ejecta. These\nlow efficiencies of destruction and injectation are due to the fact that the\nhigh disk pressures prevent the ejecta from penetrating far into the disk\nbefore stalling. Injection of gas-phase ejecta is too inefficient to be\nconsistent with the abundances of radionuclides inferred from meteorites. On\nthe other hand, the radionuclides found in meteorites would have condensed into\ndust grains in the supernova ejecta, and we argue that such grains will be\ninjected directly into the disk with nearly 100% efficiency.

{"text":"  It is known that within the interacting electron model Hamiltonian for the\none-dimensional 1\/4-filled band, the singlet ground state is a Wigner crystal\nonly if the nearest neighbor electron-electron repulsion is larger than a\ncritical value.

As a consequence, with the lowering of temperature, there can\noccur a transition from a Wigner crystal charge-ordered state to a spin-Peierls\nstate that is a Bond-Charge-Density Wave with charge occupancies different from\nthe Wigner crystal. This transition is possible because spin excitations from\nthe spin-Peierls state in the 1\/4-filled band are necessarily accompanied by\nchanges in site charge densities.

Deep, wide-field observations for this\nproject were made in two bands at the one meter Swope and 2.5 meter du Pont\ntelescope at Las Campanas Observatory. Careful attention in reduction and\nanalysis was paid to the illumination correction, background subtraction, point\nspread function determination, and galaxy subtraction. ICL flux is detected in\nboth bands in all ten clusters ranging from 7.6 x 10^{10} to 7.0 x 10^{11}\nh^{-1} solar luminosities in r and 1.4 x 10^{10} to 1.2 x 10^{11} h^{-1} solar\nluminosities in the B-band. These fluxes account for 6 to 22% of the total\ncluster light within one quarter of the virial radius in r and 4 to 21% in the\nB-band. Average ICL B-r colors range from 1.5 to 2.8 mags when k and evolution\ncorrected to the present epoch. In several clusters we also detect ICL in group\nenvironments near the cluster center and up to ~1 h^{-1} Mpc distant from the\ncluster center. Our sample, having been selected from the Abell sample, is\nincomplete in that it does not include high redshift clusters with low density,\nlow flux, or low mass, and it does not include low redshift clusters with high\nflux, mass, or density. This bias makes it difficult to interpret correlations\nbetween ICL flux and cluster properties. Despite this selection bias, we do\nfind that the presence of a cD galaxy corresponds to both centrally\nconcentrated galaxy profiles and centrally concentrated ICL profiles. This is\nconsistent with ICL either forming from galaxy interactions at the center, or\nforming at earlier times in groups and later combining in the center.\n"}
{"text":"  Fluctuations in the abundance of molecules in the living cell may affect its\ngrowth and well being. For regulatory molecules (e.g., signaling proteins or\ntranscription factors), fluctuations in their expression can affect the levels\nof downstream targets in a network. Here, we develop an analytic framework to\ninvestigate the phenomenon of noise correlation in molecular networks.\nSpecifically, we focus on the metabolic network, which is highly inter-linked,\nand noise properties may constrain its structure and function. Motivated by the\nanalogy between the dynamics of a linear metabolic pathway and that of the\nexactly soluable linear queueing network or, alternatively, a mass transfer\nsystem, we derive a plethora of results concerning fluctuations in the\nabundance of intermediate metabolites in various common motifs of the metabolic\nnetwork. For all but one case examined, we find the steady-state fluctuation in\ndifferent nodes of the pathways to be effectively uncorrelated. Consequently,\nfluctuations in enzyme levels only affect local properties and do not propagate\nelsewhere into metabolic networks, and intermediate metabolites can be freely\nshared by different reactions. Our approach may be applicable to study\nmetabolic networks with more complex topologies, or protein signaling networks\nwhich are governed by similar biochemical reactions. Possible implications for\nbioinformatic analysis of metabolimic data are discussed.\n"}
{"text":"  Context. Searching for planets in open clusters allows us to study the\neffects of dynamical environment on planet formation and evolution.\n  Aims. Considering the strong dependence of planet frequency on stellar\nmetallicity, we studied the metal rich old open cluster NGC 6791 and searched\nfor close-in planets using the transit technique.\n  Methods. A ten-night observational campaign was performed using the\nCanada-France-Hawaii Telescope (3.6m), the San Pedro M\\'artir telescope (2.1m),\nand the Loiano telescope (1.5m). To increase the transit detection probability\nwe also made use of the Bruntt et al. (2003) eight-nights observational\ncampaign. Adequate photometric precision for the detection of planetary\ntransits was achieved.\n  Results. Should the frequency and properties of close-in planets in NGC 6791\nbe similar to those orbiting field stars of similar metallicity, then detailed\nsimulations foresee the presence of 2-3 transiting planets. Instead, we do not\nconfirm the transit candidates proposed by Bruntt et al. (2003). The\nprobability that the null detection is simply due to chance coincidence is\nestimated to be 3%-10%, depending on the metallicity assumed for the cluster.\n  Conclusions. Possible explanations of the null-detection of transits include:\n(i) a lower frequency of close-in planets in star clusters; (ii) a smaller\nplanetary radius for planets orbiting super metal rich stars; or (iii)\nlimitations in the basic assumptions. More extensive photometry with 3-4m class\ntelescopes is required to allow conclusive inferences about the frequency of\nplanets in NGC 6791.\n"}
{"text":"  A significant fraction of Lyman Alpha (Lya) emitting galaxies (LAEs) at z>\n5.7 have rest-frame equivalent widths (EW) greater than ~100 Angstrom. However\nonly a small fraction of the Lya flux produced by a galaxy is transmitted\nthrough the IGM, which implies intrinsic Lya EWs that are in excess of the\nmaximum allowed for a population-II stellar population having a Salpeter mass\nfunction. In this paper we study characteristics of the sources powering Lya\nemission in high redshift galaxies. We propose a simple model for Lya emitters\nin which galaxies undergo a burst of very massive star formation that results\nin a large intrinsic EW, followed by a phase of population-II star formation\nwith a lower EW. We confront this model with a range of high redshift\nobservations and find that the model is able to simultaneously describe the\nfollowing eight properties of the high redshift galaxy population with\nplausible values for parameters like the efficiency and duration of star\nformation: i-iv) the UV and Lya luminosity functions of LAEs at z=5.7 and 6.5,\nv-vi) the mean and variance of the EW distribution of Lya selected galaxies at\nz=5.7, vii) the EW distribution of i-drop galaxies at z~6, and viii) the\nobserved correlation of stellar age with EW. Our modeling suggests that the\nobserved anomalously large intrinsic equivalent widths require a burst of very\nmassive star formation lasting no more than a few to ten percent of the\ngalaxies star forming lifetime. This very massive star formation may indicate\nthe presence of population-III star formation in a few per cent of i-drop\ngalaxies, and in about half of the Lya selected galaxies.\n"}

{"text":"  The role of the equation of state for a perfectly conducting, relativistic\nmagnetized fluid is the main subject of this work. The ideal constant\n$\\Gamma$-law equation of state, commonly adopted in a wide range of\nastrophysical applications, is compared with a more realistic equation of state\nthat better approximates the single-specie relativistic gas. The paper focus on\nthree different topics. First, the influence of a more realistic equation of\nstate on the propagation of fast magneto-sonic shocks is investigated. This\ncalls into question the validity of the constant $\\Gamma$-law equation of state\nin problems where the temperature of the gas substantially changes across\nhydromagnetic waves. Second, we present a new inversion scheme to recover\nprimitive variables (such as rest-mass density and pressure) from conservative\nones that allows for a general equation of state and avoids catastrophic\nnumerical cancellations in the non-relativistic and ultrarelativistic limits.\nFinally, selected numerical tests of astrophysical relevance (including\nmagnetized accretion flows around Kerr black holes) are compared using\ndifferent equations of state. Our main conclusion is that the choice of a\nrealistic equation of state can considerably bear upon the solution when\ntransitions from cold to hot gas (or viceversa) are present. Under these\ncircumstances, a polytropic equation of state can significantly endanger the\nsolution.\n"}
{"text":"  In this paper, we model the evolution and self-assembly of randomly oriented\ncarbon nanotubes (CNTs), grown on a metallic substrate in the form of a thin\nfilm for field emission under diode configuration.

A systematic, multiphysics based\nmodelling approach is proposed. First, a nucleation coupled model for\ndegradation of the CNT thin film is derived, where the CNTs are assumed to\ndecay by fragmentation and formation of clusters. The random orientation of the\nCNTs and the electromechanical interaction are then modeled to explain the\nself-assembly. The degraded state of the CNTs and the electromechanical force\nare employed to update the orientation of the CNTs. Field emission current at\nthe device scale is finally obtained by using the Fowler-Nordheim equation and\nintegration over the computational cell surfaces on the anode side.

The\nkilohertz QPO was only detected when the source was in a soft high-flux state\nreminiscent of the lower banana branch in atoll sources. Only one kilohertz QPO\npeak is detected at a relatively high frequency of 1258+-2 Hz and at a single\ntrial significance of more than 7 sigma. Kilohertz QPOs with a higher frequency\nhave only been found on two occasions in 4U 0614+09. Furthermore, the frequency\nis higher than that found for the lower kilohertz QPO in any source, strongly\nsuggesting that the QPO is the upper of the kilohertz QPO pair often found in\nLMXBs. The full-width at half maximum is 25+-4 Hz, making the coherence the\nhighest found for an upper kilohertz QPO. From a distance estimate of ~6 kpc\nfrom a radius expansion burst we derive that 1A 1246-588 is at a persistent\nflux of ~0.2-0.3 per cent of the Eddington flux, hence 1A 1246-588 is one of\nthe weakest LMXBs for which a kilohertz QPO has been detected.

Six of our z~2\nsources have EW6.2>~0.3um and L_14um>~10^12Lsun (implying L_IR>~10^13Lsun). At\nthese luminosities, such high EW6.2 ULIRGs do not exist in the local Universe.\nWe find a median optical depth at 9.7um of <tau_9.7>=1.4. This is consistent\nwith local IRAS-selected ULIRGs, but differs from early results on\nSCUBA-selected z~2 ULIRGs. Similar to local ULIRGs about 25% of our sample show\nextreme obscuration (tau_9.7>~3) suggesting buried nuclei. In general, we find\nthat our sources are similar to local ULIRGs, but are an order of magnitude\nmore luminous. It is not clear whether our z~2 ULIRGs are simply scaled-up\nversions of local ULIRGs, or subject to fundamentally different physical\nprocesses.\n"}

Two VLT-NACO\nimages separated by 3 years confirm that this system is co-moving to the planet\nhost star. The infrared photometry of HD65216B and C is consistent with a M7 to\nM8 (0.089Msun), and a L2 to L3 dwarf (0.078Msun), respectively, both close to\nthe sub-stellar limit. An infrared spectrum with VLT-ISAAC of the pair\nHD65216BC, even though not resolved spatially, confirms this late spectral\ntype.

This is because the survival of a satellite\ndepends on mass and on time of accretion; surviving satellites are biased\ntoward low-mass systems that have been recently accreted by the galaxy. Our\nresults support recent proposals for the origin of the systematic differences\nbetween stars in the Galactic halo and in Galactic satellites: the elusive\n``building blocks'' of the Milky Way stellar halo were on average more massive,\nand were accreted (and disrupted) earlier than the population of dwarfs that\nhas survived self-bound until the present.\n"}

The\ntwo-dimensional velocity distributions in the UV, UW, and VW planes are\nanalyzed. The evolution of the main peaks in the velocity distributions can be\nfollowed to an average age of approximately 9 Gyr. We find that: (1) in the\ndistributions of the UV velocity components, stars of different types are\nconcentrated toward several stable peaks (the Hyades, Pleiades, and Sirius\nCluster), suggesting that the stars belonging to these formations did not form\nsimultaneously; (2) the peak associated with the Hyades Cluster dominates in\nall age intervals; and (3) the Hyades peak is strongest for stars with an\naverage age of 1.5 Gyr, suggesting that this peak contains a considerable\nfraction of stars from the Hyades cluster. The age dependences of the kinematic\nparameters exhibit a break near 4.5 Gyr, which can be explained as an effect of\nthe different contributions of stars of the thin and thick disks.

The light curves of\nHS1857+5144 display a sinusoidal variation with a period of Porb=383.52 min and\npeak-to-peak amplitudes of 0.7 mag and 1.1 mag in the B-band and R-band,\nrespectively. The large amplitude of the brightness variation results from a\nreflection effect on the heated inner hemisphere of the companion star,\nsuggesting a very high temperature of the white dwarf. Our radial velocity\nstudy confirms the photometric period as the orbital period of the system. A\nmodel atmosphere fit to the spectrum of the white dwarf obtained at minimum\nlight provides limits to its mass and temperature of Mwd=~0.6-1.0 Msun and\nTwd=~70000-100000 K, respectively.

Combining the\nresults from our spectroscopy and photometry, we estimate the mass of the\ncompanion star and the binary inclination to be Msec=~0.15-0.30 Msun and\ni=~45-55 deg, respectively. We classify HS1857+5144 as one of the youngest\npre-CV known to date.

{"text":"  The stability of two-dimensional (2D) layers and membranes is subject of a\nlong standing theoretical debate. According to the so called Mermin-Wagner\ntheorem, long wavelength fluctuations destroy the long-range order for 2D\ncrystals. Similarly, 2D membranes embedded in a 3D space have a tendency to be\ncrumpled. These dangerous fluctuations can, however, be suppressed by\nanharmonic coupling between bending and stretching modes making that a\ntwo-dimensional membrane can exist but should present strong height\nfluctuations. The discovery of graphene, the first truly 2D crystal and the\nrecent experimental observation of ripples in freely hanging graphene makes\nthese issues especially important. Beside the academic interest, understanding\nthe mechanisms of stability of graphene is crucial for understanding electronic\ntransport in this material that is attracting so much interest for its unusual\nDirac spectrum and electronic properties. Here we address the nature of these\nheight fluctuations by means of straightforward atomistic Monte Carlo\nsimulations based on a very accurate many-body interatomic potential for\ncarbon. We find that ripples spontaneously appear due to thermal fluctuations\nwith a size distribution peaked around 70 \\AA which is compatible with\nexperimental findings (50-100 \\AA) but not with the current understanding of\nstability of flexible membranes.

The\nobservations we performed aim at improving our knowledge of the interferometric\nvisibility profile of Cepheids. In particular, we assess the systematic\npresence of CSE around Cepheids in order determine accurate distances with the\nIBWM free from CSE biased angular diameters.

{"text":"  Supermassive black hole (BH) masses (MBH) are strongly correlated with galaxy\nstellar bulge masses (Mbulge) and there are several ideas to explain the origin\nof this relationship. This study isolates the role of galaxy mergers from\nconsiderations of other detailed physics to more clearly show how a linear\nBH-galaxy mass relation (MBH-Mgal) can naturally emerge regardless of how\nprimordial BHs were seeded inside galaxies, if the galaxy mass function\ndeclines with increasing mass. Under this circumstance, the MBH-Mgal relation\nis a passive attractor that eventually converges to a tight linear relation\nbecause of two basic statistical effects: a central limit-like tendency for\ngalaxy mergers which is much stronger for major mergers than minor mergers, and\na convergence toward a linear relation that is due mainly to minor mergers. A\ncurious consequence of this thought experiment is that, if galaxy bulges are\nformed by major mergers, then merging statistics naturally show that MBH would\ncorrelate more strongly with bulge dominated galaxies, because of stronger\ncentral-seeking tendencies, than with disk dominated galaxies. Even if some\nother physics is ultimately responsible for causing a linear MBH-Mbulge\nrelationship, this thought experiment shows that, counter to intuition, random\nmerging of galaxies that harbor random BH masses tends to strengthen rather\nthan weaken a pre-existing, linear, correlation. This idea may be generalized\nto other gravitationally bound systems (dark matter halo, compact nuclear\nobjects) that retain their physical identities after experiencing mergers.\n"}

{"text":"  In the density functional (DF) theory of Kohn and Sham, the kinetic energy of\nthe ground state of a system of noninteracting electrons in a general external\nfield is calculated using a set of orbitals. Orbital free methods attempt to\ncalculate this directly from the electron density by approximating the\nuniversal but unknown kinetic energy density functional. However simple local\napproximations are inaccurate and it has proved very difficult to devise\ngenerally accurate nonlocal approximations. We focus instead on the kinetic\npotential, the functional derivative of the kinetic energy DF, which appears in\nthe Euler equation for the electron density. We argue that the kinetic\npotential is more local and more amenable to simple physically motivated\napproximations in many relevant cases, and describe two pathways by which the\nvalue of the kinetic energy can be efficiently calculated. We propose two\nnonlocal orbital free kinetic potentials that reduce to known exact forms for\nboth slowly varying and rapidly varying perturbations and also reproduce exact\nresults for the linear response of the density of the homogeneous system to\nsmall perturbations. A simple and systematic approach for generating accurate\nand weak ab-initio local pseudopotentials which produce a smooth slowly varying\nvalence component of the electron density is proposed for use in orbital free\nDF calculations of molecules and solids. The use of these local\npseudopotentials further minimizes the possible errors from the kinetic\npotentials.

It then attaches to whichever one\nof these contacts is most desirable in some sense, such as its distance from\nthe root or its degree. Even when the new node has just two choices, i.e., when\nk=2, the resulting network can be very different from a random graph or tree.\nFor instance, if the new node attaches to the contact which is closest to the\nroot of the tree, the distribution of depths changes from Poisson to a\ntraveling wave solution. If the new node attaches to the contact with the\nsmallest degree, the degree distribution is closer to uniform than in a random\ngraph, so that with high probability there are no nodes in the network with\ndegree greater than O(log log N). Finally, if the new node attaches to the\ncontact with the largest degree, we find that the degree distribution is a\npower law with exponent -1 up to degrees roughly equal to k, with an\nexponential cutoff beyond that; thus, in this case, we need k >> 1 to see a\npower law over a wide range of degrees.\n"}
{"text":"  BACKGROUND: An important question is whether evolution favors properties such\nas mutational robustness or evolvability that do not directly benefit any\nindividual, but can influence the course of future evolution. Functionally\nsimilar proteins can differ substantially in their robustness to mutations and\ncapacity to evolve new functions, but it has remained unclear whether any of\nthese differences might be due to evolutionary selection for these properties.\n  RESULTS: Here we use laboratory experiments to demonstrate that evolution\nfavors protein mutational robustness if the evolving population is sufficiently\nlarge. We neutrally evolve cytochrome P450 proteins under identical selection\npressures and mutation rates in populations of different sizes, and show that\nproteins from the larger and thus more polymorphic population tend towards\nhigher mutational robustness. Proteins from the larger population also evolve\ngreater stability, a biophysical property that is known to enhance both\nmutational robustness and evolvability. The excess mutational robustness and\nstability is well described by existing mathematical theories, and can be\nquantitatively related to the way that the proteins occupy their neutral\nnetwork.\n  CONCLUSIONS: Our work is the first experimental demonstration of the general\ntendency of evolution to favor mutational robustness and protein stability in\nhighly polymorphic populations. We suggest that this phenomenon may contribute\nto the mutational robustness and evolvability of viruses and bacteria that\nexist in large populations.\n"}

By applying blind MIMO system\nestimation techniques, the system response can be estimated and decoupled\nversions of the user symbols can be recovered, each one of which contains a\ndistinct CFO. By applying a decision feedback Phase Lock Loop (PLL), the CFO\ncan be mitigated and the transmitted symbols can be recovered. The estimated\nMIMO system response provides information about the CFOs that can be used to\ninitialize the PLL, speed up its convergence, and avoid ambiguities usually\nlinked with PLL.\n"}
{"text":"  We present general relativistic correction terms appearing in Newton's\ngravity to the second-order perturbations of cosmological fluids. In our\nprevious work we have shown that to the second-order perturbations, the density\nand velocity perturbation equations of general relativistic zero-pressure,\nirrotational, single-component fluid in a flat background coincide exactly with\nthe ones known in Newton's theory. Here, we present the general relativistic\nsecond-order correction terms arising due to (i) pressure, (ii)\nmulti-component, (iii) background curvature, and (iv) rotation. In case of\nmulti-component zero-pressure, irrotational fluids under the flat background,\nwe effectively do not have relativistic correction terms, thus the relativistic\nresult again coincides with the Newtonian ones. In the other three cases we\ngenerally have pure general relativistic correction terms. In case of pressure,\nthe relativistic corrections appear even in the level of background and linear\nperturbation equations. In the presence of background curvature, or rotation,\npure relativistic correction terms directly appear in the Newtonian equations\nof motion of density and velocity perturbations to the second order. In the\nsmall-scale limit (far inside the horizon), relativistic equations including\nthe rotation coincide with the ones in Newton's gravity.\n"}
{"text":"  We compute solutions of the Lagrangian-Averaged Navier-Stokes alpha-model\n(LANS) for significantly higher Reynolds numbers (up to Re 8300) than have\npreviously been accomplished. This allows sufficient separation of scales to\nobserve a Navier-Stokes (NS) inertial range followed by a 2nd LANS inertial\nrange. The analysis of the third-order structure function scaling supports the\npredicted l^3 scaling; it corresponds to a k^(-1) scaling of the energy\nspectrum. The energy spectrum itself shows a different scaling which goes as\nk^1. This latter spectrum is consistent with the absence of stretching in the\nsub-filter scales due to the Taylor frozen-in hypothesis employed as a closure\nin the derivation of LANS. These two scalings are conjectured to coexist in\ndifferent spatial portions of the flow. The l^3 (E(k) k^(-1)) scaling is\nsubdominant to k^1 in the energy spectrum, but the l^3 scaling is responsible\nfor the direct energy cascade, as no cascade can result from motions with no\ninternal degrees of freedom. We verify the prediction for the size of the LANS\nattractor resulting from this scaling. From this, we give a methodology either\nfor arriving at grid-independent solutions for LANS, or for obtaining a\nformulation of a LES optimal in the context of the alpha models. The fully\nconverged grid-independent LANS may not be the best approximation to a direct\nnumerical simulation of the NS equations since the minimum error is a balance\nbetween truncation errors and the approximation error due to using LANS instead\nof the primitive equations. Furthermore, the small-scale behavior of LANS\ncontributes to a reduction of flux at constant energy, leading to a shallower\nenergy spectrum for large alpha. These small-scale features, do not preclude\nLANS to reproduce correctly the intermittency properties of high Re flow.\n"}

By so doing, we systematically investigate how rotation and magnetic\nfields affect the collapse dynamics and explore how the properties of the\nblack-hole formations and neutrino emissions could be affected. As for the\nmicrophysics, we employ a realistic equation of state and approximate the\nneutrino transfer by a multiflavour leakage scheme. With these computations, we\nfind that the jet-like explosions are obtained by the magnetodriven shock waves\nif the initial magnetic field is as large as $10^{12}$ G. We point out that the\nblack-hole masses at the formation decrease with the initial field strength, on\nthe other hand, increase with the initial rotation rates. As for the neutrino\nproperties, we point out that the degree of the differential rotation plays an\nimportant role to determine which species of the neutrino luminosity is more\ndominant than the others. Furthermore, we find that the stronger magnetic\nfields make the peak neutrino luminosities smaller, because the magnetic\npressure acts to halt the collapse in the central regions, leading to the\nsuppression of the releasable gravitational binding energies.\n"}

A strict rime non-unitary solution is parameterized by a projective\nvector. We show that this solution transforms to the Cremmer-Gervais R-matrix\nby a change of basis with a matrix containing symmetric functions in the\ncomponents of the parameterizing vector. A strict unitary solution (the rime\nAnsatz is well adapted for taking a unitary limit) is shown to be equivalent to\na quantization of a classical \"boundary\" r-matrix of Gerstenhaber and\nGiaquinto.

{"text":"  It has been shown that the luminosity of AGNs and the size of their broad\nline region obey a simple relation of the type R=a L^g, from faint Seyfert\nnuclei to bright quasars, allowing single-epoch determination of the central\nblack hole mass M=b L^g D^2 from their luminosity L and width of H_beta\nemission line. Adopting this mass determination for cosmological studies\nrequires the extrapolation to high z and L of a relation whose calibration\nrelies so far on reverberation mapping measurements performed for L<10^46 erg\/s\nand z<0.4. We initiated a campaign for the monitoring of a few luminous,\nintermediate z quasars whose apparent magnitude V<15.7 allows observations with\na 1.8m telescope, aimed at proving that emission lines vary and respond to\ncontinuum variations even for luminosities >10^47 erg\/s, and determining\neventually their M_BH from reverberation mapping. We have repeatedly performed\nsimultaneous observations of quasars and reference stars to determine relative\nvariability of continuum and emission lines.

During 3.2 years of observation, in the former case\nno continuum variability has been detected and the evidence for line\nvariability is marginal, while in the latter case both continuum and line\nvariability are detected with high significance and the line variations appear\ncorrelated with continuum variations. The detection of the emission line\nvariability in a quasar with L~10^47 erg\/s encourages the prosecution of the\ncampaign which should provide a black hole mass estimate in other 5-6 years,\nconstraining the M_BH-L relation in a poorly explored range of luminosity.\n"}
{"text":"  If the recent PVLAS results on polarization changes of a linearly polarized\nlaser beam passing through a magnetic field are interpreted by an axion-like\nparticle, it is almost certain that it is not a standard QCD axion. Considering\nthis, we study the general effective interactions of photons with spin-zero\nparticles without restricting the latter to be a pseudo-scalar or a scalar,\ni.e., a parity eigenstate. At the lowest order in effective field theory, there\nare two dimension-5 interactions, each of which has previously been treated\nseparately for a pseudo-scalar or a scalar particle. By following the evolution\nin an external magnetic field of the system of spin-zero particles and photons,\nwe compute the changes in light polarization and the transition probability for\ntwo experimental set-ups: one-way propagation and round-trip propagation. While\nthe first may be relevant for astrophysical sources of spin-zero particles, the\nsecond applies to laboratory optical experiments like PVLAS. In the one-way\npropagation, interesting phenomena can occur for special configurations of\npolarization where, for instance, transition occurs but light polarization does\nnot change.

{"text":"  Massive merging black holes will be the primary sources of powerful\ngravitational waves at low frequency, and will permit to test general\nrelativity with candidate galaxies close to a binary black hole merger. In this\npaper we identify the typical mass ratio of the two black holes but then show\nthat the distance when gravitational radiation becomes the dominant dissipative\neffect (over dynamical friction) does not depend on the mass ratio. However the\ndynamical evolution in the gravitational wave emission regime does. For the\ntypical range of mass ratios the final stage of the merger is preceded by a\nrapid precession and a subsequent spin-flip of the main black hole. This\nalready occurs in the inspiral phase, therefore can be described analytically\nby post-Newtonian techniques. We then identify the radio galaxies with a\nsuper-disk as those in which the rapidly precessing jet produces effectively a\npowerful wind, entraining the environmental gas to produce the appearance of a\nthick disk. These specific galaxies are thus candidates for a merger of two\nblack holes to happen in the astronomically near future.\n"}

{"text":"  A new framework for asset price dynamics is introduced in which the concept\nof noisy information about future cash flows is used to derive the price\nprocesses.

Each information process is a sum of\ntwo terms; one contains true information about the value of the market factor;\nthe other represents \"noise\". The noise term is modelled by an independent\nBrownian bridge. The market filtration is assumed to be that generated by the\naggregate of the independent information processes. The price of an asset is\ngiven by the expectation of the discounted cash flows in the risk-neutral\nmeasure, conditional on the information provided by the market filtration. When\nthe cash flows are the dividend payments associated with equities, an explicit\nmodel is obtained for the share-price, and the prices of options on\ndividend-paying assets are derived.

In other words, instead of dealing with\ngeometric objects defined on the manifold $M$, as in the case of classical\nAP-geometry, we are dealing with geometric objects in the pullback bundle\n$\\pi^{-1}(TM)$ (the pullback of the tangent bundle $TM$ by $ \\pi: T\nM\\longrightarrow M$). Many new geometric objects, which have no counterpart in\nthe classical AP-geometry, emerge in this more general context. We refer to\nsuch a geometry as generalized AP-geometry (GAP-geometry).

{"text":"  To study the effects of galactic winds on the stellar metallicity\ndistributions and on the evolution of Draco and Ursa Minor dwarf spheroidal\ngalaxies, we compared the predictions of several chemical evolution models,\nadopting different prescriptions for the galactic winds, with the\nphotometrically-derived stellar metallicity distributions of both galaxies. The\nchemical evolution models for Draco and Ursa Minor, which are able to reproduce\nseveral observational features of these two galaxies, such as the several\nabundance ratios, take up-to-date nucleosynthesis into account for\nintermediate-mass stars and supernovae of both types, as well as the effect of\nthese objects on the energetics of the systems. For both galaxies, the model\nthat best fits the data contains an intense continuous galactic wind, occurring\nat a rate proportional to the star formation rate. Models with a wind rate\nassumed to be proportional only to the supernova rate also reproduce the\nobserved SMD, but do not match the gas mass, whereas the models with no\ngalactic winds fail to reproduce the observed SMDs. In the case of Ursa Minor,\nthe same model as in previous works reproduces the observed distribution very\nwell with no need to modify the main parameters of the model. The model for\nDraco, on the other hand, is slightly modified. The observed SMD requires a\nmodel with a lower supernova type Ia thermalization efficiency ($\\eta_{SNeIa}$\n= 0.5 instead of $\\eta_{SNeIa}$ = 1.0) in order to delay the galactic wind,\nwhereas all the other parameters are kept the same. The model results, compared\nto observations, strongly suggest that intense and continuous galactic winds\nplay a very important role in the evolution of local dSphs.\n"}
{"text":"  We present a novel comprehensive first-principles theoretical study of the\nelectronic properties and relative stabilities of edge-oxidized zigzag graphene\nnanoribbons. The oxidation schemes considered include hydroxyl, carboxyl,\nether, and ketone groups.

The stable oxidized\nconfigurations maintain a spin-polarized ground state with antiferromagnetic\nordering localized at the edges, similar to the fully hydrogenated\ncounterparts. More important, edge oxidation is found to lower the onset\nelectric field required to induce half-metallic behavior and extend the overall\nfield range at which the systems remain half-metallic. Once the half-metallic\nstate is reached, further increase of the external electric field intensity\nproduces a rapid decrease in the spin magnetization up to a point where the\nmagnetization is quenched completely.

{"text":"  Van Marle et al.

We perform hydrodynamic\nsimulations of the evolution of the circumstellar medium around a 60 Msol star,\nfrom the main sequence through the LBV and Wolf-Rayet stages, up to core\ncollapse. We then compute the column density of the circumstellar matter as a\nfunction of radial velocity, time and angle. This allows a comparison with the\nnumber and blue-shifts, of absorption components in the spectra of LBVs,\nWolf-Rayet stars, Type Ib\/c supernovae and gamma-ray burst afterglows. Our\nsimulation for the post-LBV stage shows the formation of various absorption\ncomponents, which are, however, rather short lived; they dissipate on time\nscales shorter than 50,000yr.

We correlate the median radio flux densities against a range of\nother sample properties, including median values for redshift, [OIII]\nluminosity, emission line ratios, and the strength of the 4000A break. We\ndetect a strong trend for sources that are actively undergoing star-formation\nto have excess radio emission beyond the ~10^28 ergs\/s\/Hz level found for\nsources without any discernible star-formation. Furthermore, this additional\nradio emission correlates well with the strength of the 4000A break in the\noptical spectrum, and may be used to assess the age of the star-forming\ncomponent. We examine two subsamples, one containing the systems with emission\nline ratios most like star-forming systems, and one with the sources that have\ncharacteristic AGN ratios. This division also separates the mechanism\nresponsible for the radio emission (star-formation vs. AGN). For both cases we\nfind a strong, almost identical, correlation between [OIII] and radio\nluminosity, with the AGN sample extending toward lower, and the star-formation\nsample toward higher luminosities. A clearer separation between the two\nsubsamples is seen as function of the central velocity dispersion of the host\ngalaxy. For systems with similar redshifts and velocity dispersions, the\nstar-formation subsample is brighter than the AGN in the radio by an order of\nmagnitude.

We\nextend our analysis here to a sample of 42 nearby (V < 7000 km\/s) Seyfert\ngalaxies hosted by early-type galaxies. We used the available HST images to\nstudy their brightness profiles. Having excluded complex and highly nucleated\ngalaxies, in the remaining 16 objects the brightness profiles can be\nsuccessfully modeled with a Nuker law with a steep nuclear cusp characteristic\nof ``power-law'' galaxies (with logarithmic slope 0.51 - 1.07).

This paper shows that the\nhigh-temperature superconductor YBa_2Cu_3O_7 possesses such a superconducting\nband. This new result together with previous observations about other\nsuperconductors and non-superconductors corroborates the theoretical evidence\nwithin the NHM that stable superconducting states are connected with\nsuperconducting bands. It is proposed that the type of superconductivity, i.e.,\nwhether the material is a conventional low-T_c or a high-T_c superconductor, is\ndetermined by the energetically lowest boson excitations that carry the crystal\nspin 1*hbar and are sufficiently stable to transport this crystal spin-angular\nmomentum through the crystal. This mechanism provides the electron-phonon\nmechanism that enters the BCS theory in conventional superconductors.\n"}
{"text":"  The frequency distribution of DNA bases A, C, G, T exhibit fractal\nfluctuations ubiquitous to dynamical systems in nature. The power spectra of\nfractal fluctuations exhibit inverse power law form signifying long-range\ncorrelations between local (small-scale) and global (large-scale)\nperturbations. The author has developed a general systems theory based on\nclassical statistical physics for fractal fluctuations which predicts that the\nprobability distribution of eddy amplitudes and the variance (square of eddy\namplitude)spectrum of fractal fluctuations follow the universal Boltzmann\ninverse power law expressed as a function of the golden mean. The model\npredicted distribution is very close to statistical normal distribution for\nfluctuations within two standard deviations from the mean and exhibits a fat\nlong tail. In this paper it is shown that DNA base CG frequency distribution in\nTakifugu rubripes (Puffer fish) Genome Release 4 exhibit universal inverse\npower law form consistent with model prediction. The observed long-range\ncorrelations in the DNA bases implies that the non-coding 'junk' or 'selfish'\nDNA which appear to be redundant, may also contribute to the efficient\nfunctioning of the protein coding DNA, a result supported by recent studies.\n"}
{"text":"  The cross-correlations between price fluctuations of 201 frequently traded\nstocks in the National Stock Exchange (NSE) of India are analyzed in this\npaper. We use daily closing prices for the period 1996-2006, which coincides\nwith the period of rapid transformation of the market following liberalization.\nThe eigenvalue distribution of the cross-correlation matrix, $\\mathbf{C}$, of\nNSE is found to be similar to that of developed markets, such as the New York\nStock Exchange (NYSE): the majority of eigenvalues fall within the bounds\nexpected for a random matrix constructed from mutually uncorrelated time\nseries. Of the few largest eigenvalues that deviate from the bulk, the largest\nis identified with market-wide movements. The intermediate eigenvalues that\noccur between the largest and the bulk have been associated in NYSE with\nspecific business sectors with strong intra-group interactions. However, in the\nIndian market, these deviating eigenvalues are comparatively very few and lie\nmuch closer to the bulk. We propose that this is because of the relative lack\nof distinct sector identity in the market, with the movement of stocks\ndominantly influenced by the overall market trend. This is shown by explicit\nconstruction of the interaction network in the market, first by generating the\nminimum spanning tree from the unfiltered correlation matrix, and later, using\nan improved method of generating the graph after filtering out the market mode\nand random effects from the data. Both methods show, compared to developed\nmarkets, the relative absence of clusters of co-moving stocks that belong to\nthe same business sector. This is consistent with the general belief that\nemerging markets tend to be more correlated than developed markets.\n"}

The aims are (i) to assess how well\ncurrent models reproduce observed spectra, (ii) to quantify the effects of the\nabundance changes on the spectra, and (iii) to determine how these changes\naffect estimates of fundamental stellar parameters.\n  Observed giant star spectra can be fitted very well at solar metallicity down\nto about 3400K. Modified surface abundances are preferred in only a minority of\ncases for luminosity class II, possibly indicating mixing in excess of standard\nfirst dredge-up.\n  Supergiant stars show a larger variety of near-IR spectra, and good fits are\ncurrently obtained for about one third of the observations only. Modified\nsurface abundances help reproducing strong CN bands, but do not suffice to\nresolve all the difficulties.

{"text":"  In this paper we continue to pursue a goal of finding an effective theory for\nhigh energy interaction in QCD based on the colour dipole approach, for which\nthe BFKL Pomeron Calculus gives a low energy limit. The key problem, that we\ntry to solve in this paper is the probabilistic interpretation of the BFKL\nPomeron Calculus in terms of the colourless dipoles and their interactions. We\ndemonstrate that the BFKL Pomeron Calculus has two equivalent descriptions :\n(i) one is the generating functional which gives a clear probabilistic\ninterpretation of the processes of high energy scattering and also provides a\nHamiltonian-like description of the system of interacting dipoles; (ii) the\nsecond is the Langevin equation with a specific noise term which is rather\ncomplicated. We found that at high energies this Langevin equation can be\nreduced to the Langevin equation for directed percolation in the momentum space\nif the impact parameter is large, namely, $b>> 1\/k$, where $k$ is the\ntransverse momentum of a dipole. Unfortunately, this simplified form of\nLangevin equation is not applicable for summation of Pomeron loops, where one\nintegrates over all possible values of impact parameter. We show that the BFKL\nPomeron calculus with two vertices (splitting $P\\to P+P$ and merging $P+P\\to P$\nof Pomerons) can be interpreted as a system of colourless dipoles with two\nprocesses: the decay of one dipole into two and the merging of two dipoles into\none dipole. However, a number of assumptions we have to make on the way to\nsimplify the noise term in the Langevin equation and\/or to apply the\nprobabilistic interpretation, therefore, we can consider both of these\napproaches in the present form only as the QCD motivated models.\n"}
{"text":"  Objectives: In this study, we quantify the growth variability of tumour cell\nclones from a human leukemia cell line. Materials and methods: We have used\nmicroplate spectrophotometry to measure the growth kinetics of hundreds of\nindividual cell clones from the Molt3 cell line. The growth rate of each clonal\npopulation has been estimated by fitting experimental data with the logistic\nequation. Results: The growth rates were observed to vary among different\nclones. Up to six clones with a growth rate above or below the mean growth rate\nof the parent population were further cloned and the growth rates of their\noffsprings were measured. The distribution of the growth rates of the subclones\ndid not significantly differ from that of the parent population thus suggesting\nthat growth variability has an epigenetic origin. To explain the observed\ndistributions of clonal growth rates we have developed a probabilistic model\nassuming that the fluctuations in the number of mitochondria through successive\ncell cycles are the leading cause of growth variability. For fitting purposes,\nwe have estimated experimentally by flow cytometry the maximum average number\nof mitochondria in Molt3 cells. The model fits nicely the observed\ndistributions of growth rates, however, cells in which the mitochondria were\nrendered non functional (rho-0 cells) showed only a 30% reduction in the clonal\ngrowth variability with respect to normal cells. Conclusions: A tumor cell\npopulation is a dynamic ensemble of clones with highly variable growth rate. At\nleast part of this variability is due to fluctuations in the number of\nmitochondria.\n"}

{"text":"  Based on our sample of 10095 galaxies with bulge-disc decompositions we\nderive the empirical B-band internal attenuation--inclination relation for\ngalaxy discs and their associated central bulges. Our results agree well with\nthe independently derived dust models of Tuffs et al., leading to a direct\nconstraint on the mean opacity of spiral discs of Tau_B^f = 3.8 +\/- 0.7\n(central face-on B-band opacity). Depending on inclination, the B-band\nattenuation correction varies from 0.2 -- 1.1 mag for discs and from 0.8 -- 2.6\nmag for bulges. We find that, overall, 37 per cent of all B-band photons\nproduced in discs in the nearby universe are absorbed by dust, a figure that\nrises to 71 per cent for bulge photons. The severity of internal dust\nextinction is such that one must incorporate internal dust corrections in all\noptical studies of large galaxy samples. This is particularly pertinent for\noptical HST comparative evolutionary studies as the dust properties will also\nbe evolving.

The main results are the following. 1) The\ncirrus noise level as a function of brightness has been previously\noverestimated. It is found to be proportional to <I> instead of <I>^1.5, where\n<I> is the local average brightness at 100 micron. This scaling is in\naccordance with the fact that the brightness fluctuation level observed at a\ngiven angular scale on the sky is the sum of fluctuations of increasing\namplitude with distance on the line of sight. 2) The spectral index of dust\nemission at scales between 5 arcmin and 12.5 degrees is <gamma>=-2.9 on average\nbut shows significant variations over the sky. Bright regions have\nsystematically steeper power spectra than diffuse regions. 3) The skewness and\nkurtosis of brightness fluctuations is high, indicative of strong\nnon-Gaussianity. 4) Based on our characterization of the 100 micron power\nspectrum we provide a prescription of the cirrus confusion noise as a function\nof wavelength and scale. 5) Finally we present a method based on a modification\nof Gaussian random fields to produce simulations of dust maps which reproduce\nthe power spectrum and non-Gaussian properties of interstellar dust emission.\n"}

{"text":"  After the work of Gladman et al. (1998), it is now assessed that many\nirregular satellites are orbiting around Uranus. Despite many studies have been\nperformed in past years, very few is know for the light-curves of these objects\nand inconsistencies are present between colours derived by different authors.\nThis situation motivated our effort to improve both the knowledge of colours\nand light curves. We present and discuss time series observations of Sycorax,\nProspero, Stephano, Setebos and Trinculo, five faint irregular satellites of\nUranus, carried out at VLT, ESO Paranal (Chile) in the nights between 29 and 30\nJuly, 2005 and 25 and 30 November, 2005. We derive light curves for Sycorax and\nProspero and colours for all of these these bodies. For Sycorax we obtain\ncolours B-V =0.839 +\/- 0.014, V-R = 0.531 +\/- 0.005 and a light curve which is\nsuggestive of a periodical variation with period about 3.6 hours and amplitude\nabout 0.067 +\/- 0.004 mag. The periods and colours we derive for Sycorax are in\nagreement with our previous determination in 1999 using NTT. We derive also a\nlight-curve for Prospero which suggests an amplitude of about 0.2 mag and a\nperiodicity of about 4 hours. However, the sparseness of our data, prevents a\nmore precise characterization of the light-curves, and we can not determine\nwether they are one-peaked or two-peaked. Hence, these periods and amplitudes\nhave to be considered preliminary estimates. As for Setebos, Stephano and\nTrinculo the present data do not allow to derive any unambiguous periodicity,\ndespite Setebos displays a significant variability with amplitude about as\nlarge as that of Prospero. Colours for Prospero, Setebos, Stephano and Trinculo\nare in marginal agreement with the literature.\n"}
{"text":"  Long Gamma Ray Bursts hold the promise of probing star-formation and metal\nenrichment up to very high redshifts. The present GRB samples with redshift\ndetermination are largely incomplete and therefore a careful analysis of\nselection effects is mandatory before any conclusion can be drawn from the\nobserved GRB redshift distribution. We study and compare three well defined\nsamples of long GRBs detected by Swift, HETE2 and BeppoSAX. We find that Swift\nGRBs are slighly fainter and harder than BeppoSAX and HETE2 GRBs, as expected\ndue to the higher energy range in which Swift GRBs are detected and localized,\ncompared to BeppoSAX and HETE2. Gas and dust obscuration plays a role in\nshaping the GRB samples and the present samples of GRBs with redshift. We argue\nthat the majority of the bright Swift GRBs without redshift might actually be\nz<~2 events therefore the present Swift GRB sample with redshift is biased\nagainst low-z GRBs. On the other hand, the detection of bright UV rest-frame\nafterglows from high-z GRBs, and even from those with large X-ray obscuration,\nimplies a dust amount lower than in nearby GRBs,and\/or a different dust\ncomposition. If this is the case, the Swift sample of GRBs with redshifts is\nprobably a fair sample of the real high-z GRB population. The absence of high-z\nGRBs in the BeppoSAX and HETE2 samples of GRBs with redshifts is probably due\nto the fact at the time of BeppoSAX and HETE2 follow-up faint afterglows of\nhigh redshift GRBs will have weaken below the spectroscopic capabilities of\neven 10m class telescopes. The redshift distribution of a subsample of Swift\nGRBs with distributions of peak-fluxes, X-ray obscuration and optical magnitude\nat a fixed observing time similar to those of the BeppoSAX and HETE2 samples,\nis roughly consistent with BeppoSAX+HETE2 redshift distribution.\n"}

Using a\nrigorous eigenfunction expansion method, we obtain a closed-form expression for\nthe Green's function describing the upscattering of monochromatic radiation\ninjected into the column. The Green's function is convolved with\nbremsstrahlung, cyclotron, and blackbody source terms to calculate the emergent\nphoton spectrum.

{"text":"  The absolute calibration and characterization of the Multiband Imaging\nPhotometer for Spitzer (MIPS) 70 micron coarse- and fine-scale imaging modes\nare presented based on over 2.5 years of observations. Accurate photometry\n(especially for faint sources) requires two simple processing steps beyond the\nstandard data reduction to remove long-term detector transients. Point spread\nfunction (PSF) fitting photometry is found to give more accurate flux densities\nthan aperture photometry. Based on the PSF fitting photometry, the calibration\nfactor shows no strong trend with flux density, background, spectral type,\nexposure time, or time since anneals. The coarse-scale calibration sample\nincludes observations of stars with flux densities from 22 mJy to 17 Jy, on\nbackgrounds from 4 to 26 MJy sr^-1, and with spectral types from B to M. The\ncoarse-scale calibration is 702 +\/- 35 MJy sr^-1 MIPS70^-1 (5% uncertainty) and\nis based on measurements of 66 stars. The instrumental units of the MIPS 70\nmicron coarse- and fine-scale imaging modes are called MIPS70 and MIPS70F,\nrespectively. The photometric repeatability is calculated to be 4.5% from two\nstars measured during every MIPS campaign and includes variations on all time\nscales probed. The preliminary fine-scale calibration factor is 2894 +\/- 294\nMJy sr^-1 MIPS70F^-1 (10% uncertainty) based on 10 stars. The uncertainty in\nthe coarse- and fine-scale calibration factors are dominated by the 4.5%\nphotometric repeatability and the small sample size, respectively. The 5-sigma,\n500 s sensitivity of the coarse-scale observations is 6-8 mJy.

{"text":"  We first reported evidence for differential rotation of Kappa1 Ceti in Paper\nI. In this paper we demonstrate that the differential rotation pattern closely\nmatches that for the Sun.

Using StarSpotz, a\nprogram developed specifically to analyze MOST photometry, we have solved for\nk, the differential rotation coefficient, and P_{EQ}, the equatorial rotation\nperiod using the light curves from all three years. The spots range in latitude\nfrom 10 to 75 degrees and k = 0.090^{+0.006}_{-0.005} -- less than the solar\nvalue but consistent with the younger age of the star. k is also well\nconstrained by the independent spectroscopic estimate of vsini.

{"text":"  Using a large sample of spiral galaxies for which 21 cm single-dish and\/or\nlong-slit optical spectra are available, we make a detailed comparison between\nvarious estimates of rotational widths. Different optical width estimators are\nconsidered and their limitations discussed, with emphasis on biases associated\nwith rotation curve properties (shape and extent) and disk central surface\nbrightness. The best match with HI rotational velocities is obtained with\nPolyex widths, which are measured at the optical radius (encompassing a fixed\nfraction of the total light of the galaxy) from a model fit to the rotation\ncurve. In contrast with Polyex widths, optical rotational velocities measured\nat 2.15 disk scale lengths r_d deviate from HI widths by an amount that\ncorrelates with the central surface brightness of the disk. This bias occurs\nbecause the rotation curves of galaxies are in general still rising at 2.15\nr_d, and the fraction of total mass contained within this radius decreases with\nincreasing disk surface brightness. Statistical corrections, parameterized by\nthe radial extent of the observed rotation curve, are provided to reduce Polyex\nand HI width measurements into a homogeneous system. This yields a single\nrobust estimate of rotational velocity to be used for applications of disk\nscaling relations.\n"}

{"text":"  Electroweak theory joins electromagnetism with the weak force in a single\nquantum field theory, ascribing the two fundamental interactions--so different\nin their manifestations--to a common symmetry principle. How the electroweak\ngauge symmetry is hidden is one of the most urgent and challenging questions\nfacing particle physics. The provisional answer incorporated in the \"standard\nmodel\" of particle physics was formulated in the 1960s by Higgs, by Brout &\nEnglert, and by Guralnik, Hagen & Kibble: The agent of electroweak symmetry\nbreaking is an elementary scalar field whose self-interactions select a vacuum\nstate in which the full electroweak symmetry is hidden, leaving a residual\nphase symmetry of electromagnetism. By analogy with the Meissner effect of the\nsuperconducting phase transition, the Higgs mechanism, as it is commonly known,\nconfers masses on the weak force carriers W and Z. It also opens the door to\nmasses for the quarks and leptons, and shapes the world around us. It is a good\nstory--though an incomplete story--and we do not know how much of the story is\ntrue. Experiments that explore the Fermi scale (the energy regime around 1 TeV)\nduring the next decade will put the electroweak theory to decisive test, and\nmay uncover new elements needed to construct a more satisfying completion of\nthe electroweak theory.

{"text":"  This paper focuses on supergravity duals of BPS states in N=4 super\nYang-Mills. In order to describe these duals, we begin with a sequence of\nbreathing mode reductions of IIB supergravity: first on S^3, then S^3 x S^1,\nand finally on S^3 x S^1 x CP^1. We then follow with a complete supersymmetry\nanalysis, yielding 1\/8, 1\/4 and 1\/2 BPS configurations, respectively (where in\nthe last step we take the Hopf fibration of S^3). The 1\/8 BPS geometries, which\nhave an S^3 isometry and are time-fibered over a six-dimensional base, are\ndetermined by solving a non-linear equation for the Kahler metric on the base.\nSimilarly, the 1\/4 BPS configurations have an S^3 x S^1 isometry and a\nfour-dimensional base, whose Kahler metric obeys another non-linear,\nMonge-Ampere type equation.\n  Despite the non-linearity of the problem, we develop a universal bubbling AdS\ndescription of these geometries by focusing on the boundary conditions which\nensure their regularity. In the 1\/8 BPS case, we find that the S^3 cycle\nshrinks to zero size on a five-dimensional locus inside the six-dimensional\nbase. Enforcing regularity of the full solution requires that the interior of a\nsmooth, generally disconnected five-dimensional surface be removed from the\nbase. The AdS_5 x S^5 ground state corresponds to excising the interior of an\nS^5, while the 1\/8 BPS excitations correspond to deformations (including\ntopology change) of the S^5 and\/or the excision of additional droplets from the\nbase. In the case of 1\/4 BPS configurations, by enforcing regularity\nconditions, we identify three-dimensional surfaces inside the four-dimensional\nbase which separate the regions where the S^3 shrinks to zero size from those\nwhere the S^1 shrinks.\n"}
{"text":"  GRB 060614 is a remarkable GRB observed by Swift with puzzling properties,\nwhich challenge current progenitor models. The lack of any bright SN down to\nvery strict limits and the vanishing spectral lags are typical of short GRBs,\nstrikingly at odds with the long (102s) duration of this event. Here we present\nspectral and temporal analysis of the Swift observations. We show that the\nburst presents standard optical, UV and X-ray afterglows. An achromatic break\nis observed simultaneously in optical and X-rays, at a time consistent with the\nbreak in the R-band light curve measured by the VLT. The achromatic behaviour\nand the consistent post-break decay slopes make GRB 060614 one of the best\nexamples of a jet break for a Swift burst. The optical, UV and X-rays afterglow\nlight curves have also an earlier break at ~30 ks. In the optical, there is\nstrong spectral evolution around this break, suggesting the passage of a break\nfrequency through the optical\/UV band. The very blue spectrum at early times\nand the trend in the light curves (rising at low frequencies, and decaying at\nhigher energies) suggest this may be the injection frequency. The early X-ray\nlight curve is well interpreted as the X-ray counterpart of the burst extended\nemission. Spectral analysis of BAT\/XRT data in the 80s overlap time show that\nthe Ep of the burst has decreased to as low as 8keV at the beginning of the XRT\nobservation. The Ep continues to decrease through the XRT energy band and exits\nit at about 500s after the trigger. The average Ep of the burst is likely < 24\nkeV but larger than 8 keV. The initial peak observed by BAT is however\ndistinctly harder than the rest with Ep ~300 keV as measured by Konus Wind.\nConsidering the time-averaged spectral properties, GRB 060614 is consistent\nwith the Eiso-Ep_rest, Egamma-Ep_rest, and Liso-Ep correlations.\n"}

The LBGs without Ly-alpha emission\nform a filamentary structure including the QSO, while the LAEs are distributed\naround the QSO but avoid it within a distance of ~4.5Mpc. On the other hand, we\nserendipitously discovered a protocluster with a significant concentration of\nLBGs and LAEs where no strongly UV ionizing source such as a QSO or radio\ngalaxy is known to exist. In this cluster field, two populations are spatially\ncross-correlated with each other. The relative spatial distribution of LAEs to\nLBGs is in stark contrast between the QSO and the cluster fields.

The\nLAEs avoid the nearby region around the QSO where the local UV background\nradiation could be ~100 times stronger than the average for the epoch. The\nclustering segregation between LBGs and LAEs seen in the QSO field could be due\nto either enhanced early galaxy formation in an overdense environment having\ncaused all the LAEs to evolve into LBGs, or local photoionization due to the\nstrong UV radiation from the QSO effectively causing a deficit in low-mass\ngalaxies like LAEs.\n"}

Reionization increases the measured clustering of emitters,\nand we show that this enhancement would be essentially impossible to attribute\nto anything other than reionization.

{"text":"  In papers I and II in this series, we presented hydrodynamical simulations of\njet models with parameters representative of the symbiotic system MWC 560.\nThese were simulations of a pulsed, initially underdense jet in a high density\nambient medium.

In this paper, we investigate in detail the X-ray properties of the\njets in our models. We have focused our study on the total X-ray luminosity and\nits temporal variability, the resulting spectra and the spatial distribution of\nthe emission. Temperature and density maps from our hydrodynamical simulations\nwith radiative cooling presented in the second paper are used together with\nemissivities calculated with the atomic database ATOMDB.

{"text":"  We present evidence for the formation of dust grains in an unusual Type Ib SN\nbased on late-time spectra of SN 2006jc.

The key\nevidence for dust formation is (a) the appearance of a red\/near-IR continuum\nsource fit by 1600 K graphite grains, and (b) fading of the redshifted sides of\nHe I emission lines, yielding progressively more asymmetric blueshifted lines\nas dust obscures receding material. This provides the strongest case yet for\ndust formation in any SN Ib\/c. Both developments occurred between 51 and 75 d\nafter peak, while other SNe observed to form dust did so after a few hundred\ndays. Geometric considerations indicate that dust formed in the dense swept-up\nshell between the forward and reverse shocks, and not in the freely expanding\nSN ejecta. Rapid cooling leading to dust formation may have been aided by\nextremely high shell densities, as indicated by He I line ratios. The brief\nepoch of dust formation is accompanied by He II 4686 emission and enhanced\nX-ray emission.

Debris trails due to mm-sized or larger particles were found\nalong the orbits of 27 comets; 4 comets had small-particle dust tails and a\nviewing geometry that made debris trails impossible to distinguish; and only 3\nhad no debris trail despite favorable observing conditions. There are now 30\nJupiter-family comets with known debris trails, of which 22 are reported in\nthis paper for the first time. The detection rate is >80%, indicating that\ndebris trails are a generic feature of short-period comets. By comparison to\norbital calculations for particles of a range of sizes ejected over 2 yr prior\nto observation, we find that particles comprising 4 debris trails are typically\nmm-sized while the remainder of the debris trails require particles larger than\nthis. The lower-limit masses of the debris trails are typically 10^11 g, and\nthe median mass loss rate is 2 kg\/s.

{"text":"  In this work, the critical role of noisy feedback in enhancing the secrecy\ncapacity of the wiretap channel is established. Unlike previous works, where a\nnoiseless public discussion channel is used for feedback, the feed-forward and\nfeedback signals share the same noisy channel in the present model. Quite\ninterestingly, this noisy feedback model is shown to be more advantageous in\nthe current setting. More specifically, the discrete memoryless modulo-additive\nchannel with a full-duplex destination node is considered first, and it is\nshown that the judicious use of feedback increases the perfect secrecy capacity\nto the capacity of the source-destination channel in the absence of the\nwiretapper. In the achievability scheme, the feedback signal corresponds to a\nprivate key, known only to the destination. In the half-duplex scheme, a novel\nfeedback technique that always achieves a positive perfect secrecy rate (even\nwhen the source-wiretapper channel is less noisy than the source-destination\nchannel) is proposed. These results hinge on the modulo-additive property of\nthe channel, which is exploited by the destination to perform encryption over\nthe channel without revealing its key to the source. Finally, this scheme is\nextended to the continuous real valued modulo-$\\Lambda$ channel where it is\nshown that the perfect secrecy capacity with feedback is also equal to the\ncapacity in the absence of the wiretapper.\n"}

The armchair edge\nGNR channel shares similarities with a zigzag CNT, but it has a different\ngeometry and quantum confinement boundary condition in the transverse\ndirection. The results indicate that the I-V characteristics are ambipolar and\nstrongly depend on the GNR width because the bandgap of the GNR is\napproximately inversely proportional to its width, which agrees with recent\nexperiments. A multiple gate geometry improves immunity to short channel\neffects, but it offers smaller improvement than it does for Si MOSFETs in terms\nof the on-current and transconductance. Reducing the oxide thickness is more\nuseful for improving transistor performance than using a high-k gate insulator.\nSignificant increase of the minimal leakage current is observed when the\nchannel length is scaled below 10nm because the small effective mass\nfacilitates strong source-drain tunneling.

{"text":"  The energy density of the universe today may be dominated by the vacuum\nenergy of a slowly rolling scalar field. Making a quantum expansion around such\na time dependent solution is found to break fundamental symmetries of quantum\nfield theory.

We illustrate this with a toy scalar field theory, whose action\ndisplays a U(1) symmetry. We identify a symmetry, called pseudo-scale\ninvariance, which sets the cosmological constant exactly equal to zero, both in\nclassical and quantum theory. This symmetry is also broken cosmologically and\nleads to a nonzero vacuum or dark energy. The slow roll condition along with\nthe observed value of dark energy leads to a value of the background scalar\nfield of the order of Planck mass. We also consider a U(1) gauge symmetry\nmodel. Cosmological symmetry breaking, in this case, leads to a non zero mass\nfor the vector field.

{"text":"  aims: Our aim is to determine Li abundances in TO stars of the Globular\nCluster 47 Tuc and test theories about Li variations among TO stars. method: We\nmake use of high resolution (R~ 43000), high signal-to-noise ratio (S\/N=50--70)\nspectra of 4 turn off (TO) stars obtained with the UVES spectrograph at the\n8.2m VLT Kueyen telescope. results: The four stars observed, span the range\n1.6<~A(Li)} <~ 2.14, providing a mean A(Li) = 1.84 with a standard deviation of\n0.25 dex. When coupled with data of other two TO stars of the cluster,\navailable in the literature, the full range in Li abundances observed in this\ncluster is 1.6<~A(Li)<~ 2.3. The variation in A(Li) is at least 0.6 dex (0.7\ndex considering also the data available in the literature) and the scatter is\nsix times larger than what expected from the observational error. We claim that\nthese variations are real. A(Li) seems to be anti-correlated with A(Na) exactly\nas observed in NGC 6752. No systematic error in our analysis could produce such\nan anti-correlation. conclusions: Na production through p captures on 22Ne at\ntemperatures in excess of 3x10^7 K and the contemporary Li destruction could\nresult in this anti-correlation. However such nuclear processing cannot have\ntaken place in the stars themselves, which do not reach such high temperatures,\neven at their centre. This points towards the processing in a previous\ngeneration of stars. The low N\/O ratios in the observed stars and the apparent\nlack of correlation between N an Li abundances, place a strong constraint on\nthe properties of this previous generation. Our results indicate a different\nbehaviour among the Globular Clusters so far studied as far as the abundance\npatterns are concerned.\n"}
{"text":"  We discuss the difficulties of predicting the solar cycle using mean-field\nmodels. Here we argue that these difficulties arise owing to the significant\nmodulation of the solar activity cycle, and that this modulation arises owing\nto either stochastic or deterministic processes. We analyse the implications\nfor predictability in both of these situations by considering two separate\nsolar dynamo models. The first model represents a stochastically-perturbed flux\ntransport dynamo. Here even very weak stochastic perturbations can give rise to\nsignificant modulation in the activity cycle. This modulation leads to a loss\nof predictability. In the second model, we neglect stochastic effects and\nassume that generation of magnetic field in the Sun can be described by a fully\ndeterministic nonlinear mean-field model -- this is a best case scenario for\nprediction. We designate the output from this deterministic model (with\nparameters chosen to produce chaotically modulated cycles) as a target\ntimeseries that subsequent deterministic mean-field models are required to\npredict. Long-term prediction is impossible even if a model that is correct in\nall details is utilised in the prediction. Furthermore, we show that even\nshort-term prediction is impossible if there is a small discrepancy in the\ninput parameters from the fiducial model. This is the case even if the\npredicting model has been tuned to reproduce the output of previous cycles.\nGiven the inherent uncertainties in determining the transport coefficients and\nnonlinear responses for mean-field models, we argue that this makes predicting\nthe solar cycle using the output from such models impossible.\n"}

{"text":"  We consider a cognitive network consisting of n random pairs of cognitive\ntransmitters and receivers communicating simultaneously in the presence of\nmultiple primary users. Of interest is how the maximum throughput achieved by\nthe cognitive users scales with n. Furthermore, how far these users must be\nfrom a primary user to guarantee a given primary outage. Two scenarios are\nconsidered for the network scaling law: (i) when each cognitive transmitter\nuses constant power to communicate with a cognitive receiver at a bounded\ndistance away, and (ii) when each cognitive transmitter scales its power\naccording to the distance to a considered primary user, allowing the cognitive\ntransmitter-receiver distances to grow. Using single-hop transmission, suitable\nfor cognitive devices of opportunistic nature, we show that, in both scenarios,\nwith path loss larger than 2, the cognitive network throughput scales linearly\nwith the number of cognitive users. We then explore the radius of a primary\nexclusive region void of cognitive transmitters. We obtain bounds on this\nradius for a given primary outage constraint.

{"text":"  In this article we obtain a fundamental measure functional for the model of\naligned hard hexagons in the plane. Our aim is not just to provide a functional\nfor a new, admittedly academic, model, but to investigate the structure of\nfundamental measure theory. A model of aligned hard hexagons has similarities\nwith the hard disk model. Both share \"lost cases\", i.e. admit configurations of\nthree particles in which there is pairwise overlap but not triple overlap.\nThese configurations are known to be problematic for fundamental measure\nfunctionals, which are not able to capture their contribution correctly. This\nfailure lies in the inability of these functionals to yield a correct low\ndensity limit of the third order direct correlation function. Here we derive\nthe functional by projecting aligned hard cubes on the plane x+y+z=0. The\ncorrect dimensional crossover behavior of these functionals permits us to\nfollow this strategy. The functional of aligned hard cubes, however, does not\nhave lost cases, so neither had the resulting functional for aligned hard\nhexagons. The latter exhibits, in fact, a peculiar structure as compared to the\none for hard disks. It depends on a uniparametric family of weighted densities\nthrough a new term not appearing in the functional for hard disks. Apart from\nstudying the freezing of this system, we discuss the implications of the\nfunctional structure for new developments of fundamental measure theory.\n"}

{"text":"  Context: The mass-loss rate is a key parameter of massive stars. Adequate\nstellar atmosphere models are required for spectral analyses and mass-loss\ndeterminations. Present models can only account for the inhomogeneity of\nstellar winds in the approximation of small-scale structures that are optically\nthin. This treatment of ``microclumping'' has led to reducing empirical\nmass-loss rates by factors of two and more. Aims: Stellar wind clumps can be\noptically thick in spectral lines. We investigate how this ``macroclumping''\nimpacts on empirical mass-loss rates. Methods: The Potsdam Wolf-Rayet (PoWR)\nmodel atmosphere code is generalized in the ``formal integral'' to account for\nclumps that are not necessarily optically thin. Results: Optically thick clumps\nreduce the effective opacity. This has a pronounced effect on the emergent\nspectrum. Our modeling for the O-type supergiant zeta Puppis reveals that the\noptically thin H-alpha line is not affected by wind porosity, but that the PV\nresonance doublet becomes significantly weaker when macroclumping is taken into\naccount. The reported discrepancies between resonance-line and\nrecombination-line diagnostics can be resolved entirely with the macroclumping\nmodeling without downward revision of the mass-loss rate. Conclusions:\nMass-loss rates inferred from optically thin emission, such as the H-alpha line\nin O stars, are not influenced by macroclumping. The strength of optically\nthick lines, however, is reduced because of the porosity effects. Therefore,\nneglecting the porosity in stellar wind modeling can lead to underestimating\nempirical mass-loss rates.\n"}
{"text":"  It has been shown based on radio variability arguments that some BALQSOs\n(broad absorption line quasars) are viewed along the polar axis (orthogonal to\naccretion disk) in the recent article of Zhou et al.

{"text":"  We present radio and X-ray observations of an impulsive solar flare that was\nmoderately intense in microwaves, yet showed very meager EUV and X-ray\nemission. The flare occurred on 2001 Oct 24 and was well-observed at radio\nwavelengths by the Nobeyama Radioheliograph (NoRH), the Nobeyama Radio\nPolarimeters (NoRP), and by the Owens Valley Solar Array (OVSA).

{"text":"  Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) cluster surveys are considered among the most\npromising methods for probing dark energy up to large redshifts. However, their\npremise is hinged upon an accurate mass-observable relationship, which could be\naffected by the (rather poorly understood) physics of the intracluster gas. In\nthis letter, using a semi-analytic model of the intracluster gas that\naccommodates various theoretical uncertainties, I develop a Fundamental Plane\nrelationship between the observed size, thermal energy, and mass of galaxy\nclusters. In particular, I find that M ~ (Y_{SZ}\/R_{SZ,2})^{3\/4}, where M is\nthe mass, Y_{SZ} is the total SZ flux or thermal energy, and R_{SZ,2} is the SZ\nhalf-light radius of the cluster. I first show that, within this model, using\nthe Fundamental Plane relationship reduces the (systematic+random) errors in\nmass estimates to 14%, from 22% for a simple mass-flux relationship. Since\nmeasurement of the cluster sizes is an inevitable part of observing the SZ\nclusters, the Fundamental Plane relationship can be used to reduce the error of\nthe cluster mass estimates by ~ 34%, improving the accuracy of the resulting\ncosmological constraints without any extra cost. I then argue why our\nFundamental Plane is distinctly different from the virial relationship that one\nmay naively expect between the cluster parameters. Finally, I argue that while\nincluding more details of the observed SZ profile cannot significantly improve\nthe accuracy of mass estimates, a better understanding of the impact of\nnon-gravitational heating\/cooling processes on the outskirts of the\nintracluster medium (apart from external calibrations) might be the best way to\nreduce these errors.\n"}

{"text":"  The chemical composition of Earth's atmosphere has undergone substantial\nevolution over the course of its history.

Using the Hipparcos catalogue as a reference to calibrate\npotential biases, we have extracted volume-limited samples of nearby stars from\nthe Valenti-Fischer dataset. Unlike other recent investigations, our analysis\nshows clear evidence for an age-metallicity relation in the local disk, albeit\nwith substantial dispersion at any epoch. The mean metallicity increases from\n-0.3 dex at a lookback time of ~10 Gyrs to +0.15 dex at the present day.\nSupplementing the Valenti-Fischer measurements with literature data to give a\ncomplete volume-limited sample, the age distribution of nearby FGK dwarfs is\nbroadly consistent with a uniform star-formation rate over the history of the\nGalactic disk. In striking contrast, most stars known to have planetary\ncompanions are younger than 5 Gyrs; however, stars with planetary companions\nwithin 0.4 AU have a significantly flatter age distribution, indicating that\nthose systems are stable on timescales of many Gyrs.

Specifically, we study the level both of the horizontal (HB) and red giant\nbranches (RGB) relative to the main-sequence turnoff (TO) in the U magnitude.\nAlong with the presented photometry of M75, we use our collection of\nphotometric data on GCs belonging to the metal-poor range, [Fe\/H]zw<-1.1 dex,\nobtained from observations with different equipment, but calibrated by standard\nstars situated in the observed cluster fields. We confirm our earlier finding,\nand extend it to a larger magnitude range.We demonstrate that DeltaU_{TO}^{BHB}\nexpressing the difference in U magnitude between the TO point and the level of\nthe blue HB, near its red boundary, of the metal-poor GCs observed with the\nEMMI camera of the NTT\/ESO telescope is about 0.4-0.5 mag smaller as compared\nto GCs observed with the 100\" telescope and 1.3 m Warsaw telescope of the Las\nCampanas Observatory. At the same time, Delta U_{TO}^{RGB}, the difference in U\nmagnitude between the TO and RGB inflection (brightest) points, does not show\nsuch an apparent dependence on the characteristics of U filters used, but it\ndepends on cluster metallicity. We have shown, for the first time, the\ndependence of the parameter DeltaU_{TO}^{RGB} on [Fe\/H] and have estimated its\nanalytical expression, by assuming a linear relation between the parameter and\nmetallicity. Its slope, Delta U_{TO}^{RGB}\/Delta [Fe\/H]~1.2 mag\/dex, is approx.\na factor of two steeper than that of the dependence of the RGB bump position in\nthe V magnitude on metallicity.

{"text":"  Gravitational waves from the inspiral and coalescence of supermassive\nblack-hole (SMBH) binaries with masses ~10^6 Msun are likely to be among the\nstrongest sources for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). We\ndescribe a three-stage data-analysis pipeline designed to search for and\nmeasure the parameters of SMBH binaries in LISA data. The first stage uses a\ntime-frequency track-search method to search for inspiral signals and provide a\ncoarse estimate of the black-hole masses m_1, m_2 and of the coalescence time\nof the binary t_c. The second stage uses a sequence of matched-filter template\nbanks, seeded by the first stage, to improve the measurement accuracy of the\nmasses and coalescence time. Finally, a Markov Chain Monte Carlo search is used\nto estimate all nine physical parameters of the binary. Using results from the\nsecond stage substantially shortens the Markov Chain burn-in time and allows us\nto determine the number of SMBH-binary signals in the data before starting\nparameter estimation. We demonstrate our analysis pipeline using simulated data\nfrom the first LISA Mock Data Challenge. We discuss our plan for improving this\npipeline and the challenges that will be faced in real LISA data analysis.\n"}
{"text":"  Surviving in a diverse environment requires corresponding organism responses.\nAt the cellular level, such adjustment relies on the transcription factors\n(TFs) which must rapidly find their target sequences amidst a vast amount of\nnon-relevant sequences on DNA molecules. Whether these transcription factors\nlocate their target sites through a 1D or 3D pathway is still a matter of\nspeculation. It has been suggested that the optimum search time is when the\nprotein equally shares its search time between 1D and 3D diffusions. In this\npaper, we study the above problem using a Monte Carlo simulation by considering\na very simple physical model. A 1D strip, representing a DNA, with a number of\nlow affinity sites, corresponding to non-target sites, and high affinity sites,\ncorresponding to target sites, is considered and later extended to a 2D strip.\nWe study the 1D and 3D exploration pathways, and combinations of the two modes\nby considering three different types of molecules: a walker that randomly walks\nalong the strip with no dissociation; a jumper that represents dissociation and\nthen re-association of a TF with the strip at later time at a distant site; and\na hopper that is similar to the jumper but it dissociates and then\nre-associates at a faster rate than the jumper. We analyze the final\nprobability distribution of molecules for each case and find that TFs can\nlocate their targets fast enough even if they spend 15% of their search time\ndiffusing freely in the solution. This indeed agrees with recent experimental\nresults obtained by Elf et al. 2007 and is in contrast with theoretical\nexpectation.\n"}

We examine its nature and\nsurroundings by analyzing the projected galaxy distribution, the galaxy\nvelocity distribution, the weak-lensing mass reconstruction, and the X-ray\nspectroscopy and imaging. The cluster shows a complex morphology. It is\ncomposed by at least two structures along the line-of-sight, with velocity\ndispersions of 592+-82 km s^-1 and 391+-85 km s^-1 respectively. Other\nstructures are also detected in X-ray, in the galaxy projected number density\nmap, and by weak-lensing.

We find that the mass determination inferred from\nweak-lensing is in average 3 to 4.8 times higher (depending on the model\nassumed) than the X-ray mass. We have two possible explanations for this\ndiscrepancy: i) the cluster is in non-equilibrium, then the deviation of the\nX-ray estimated mass from the true value can be as high as a factor of two; ii)\nthe intervening mass along the line-of-sight of the cluster is producing an\nover-estimation of the weak-lensing mass.

{"text":"  Context:A significant fraction of progenitors for long gamma-ray bursts\n(GRBs) are believed to be massive stars.

We simulate the\nexpansion of an isotropic, adiabatic relativistic fireball into the wind-shaped\nmedium around a massive GRB progenitor. The circumburst medium is composed of a\nrealistically stratified stellar wind zone up to its termination shock,\nfollowed by a region of shocked wind characterized by a constant density. Aims:\nWe followed the evolution of the blastwave through all its stages, including\nthe extremely rapid acceleration up to a Lorentz factor 75 flow, its\ndeceleration by interaction with stellar wind, its passage of the wind\ntermination shock, until its propagation through shocked wind. Methods: We used\nthe adaptive mesh refinement versatile advection code to follow the evolution\nof the fireball. Results: We show that the acceleration from purely thermal to\nultra-relativistic kinetic regimes is abrupt and produces an internally\nstructured blastwave. We resolved the structure of this ultra-relativistic\nshell in all stages, thanks to the adaptive mesh.

{"text":"  A main distinguishing feature of a wireless network compared with a wired\nnetwork is its broadcast nature, in which the signal transmitted by a node may\nreach several other nodes, and a node may receive signals from several other\nnodes simultaneously. Rather than a blessing, this feature is treated more as\nan interference-inducing nuisance in most wireless networks today (e.g., IEEE\n802.11). This paper shows that the concept of network coding can be applied at\nthe physical layer to turn the broadcast property into a capacity-boosting\nadvantage in wireless ad hoc networks. Specifically, we propose a\nphysical-layer network coding (PNC) scheme to coordinate transmissions among\nnodes. In contrast to straightforward network coding which performs coding\narithmetic on digital bit streams after they have been received, PNC makes use\nof the additive nature of simultaneously arriving electromagnetic (EM) waves\nfor equivalent coding operation. And in doing so, PNC can potentially achieve\n100% and 50% throughput increases compared with traditional transmission and\nstraightforward network coding, respectively, in multi-hop networks. More\nspecifically, the information-theoretic capacity of PNC is almost double that\nof traditional transmission in the SNR region of practical interest (higher\nthan 0dB). We believe this is a first paper that ventures into EM-wave-based\nnetwork coding at the physical layer and demonstrates its potential for\nboosting network capacity.\n"}

The approach is based on the concept\nof low order conditional dependence graph that we extend here in the case of\nDynamic Bayesian Networks. Most of our results are based on the theory of\ngraphical models associated with the Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). In this\nway, we define a minimal DAG G which describes exactly the full order\nconditional dependencies given the past of the process. Then, to face with the\nlarge p and small n estimation case, we propose to approximate DAG G by\nconsidering low order conditional independencies. We introduce partial qth\norder conditional dependence DAGs G(q) and analyze their probabilistic\nproperties. In general, DAGs G(q) differ from DAG G but still reflect relevant\ndependence facts for sparse networks such as genetic networks. By using this\napproximation, we set out a non-bayesian inference method and demonstrate the\neffectiveness of this approach on both simulated and real data analysis. The\ninference procedure is implemented in the R package 'G1DBN' freely available\nfrom the CRAN archive.\n"}

{"text":"  In the semi-classical treatment, i.e. in a classical black hole geometry,\nHawking quanta emerge from trans-Planckian configurations because of scale\ninvariance. There is indeed no scale to stop the blue-shifting effect\nencountered in the backward propagation towards the event horizon. On the\ncontrary, when taking into account the gravitational interactions neglected in\nthe semi-classical treatment, a UV scale stopping the blue-shift could be\ndynamically engendered. To show that this is the case, we use a\nnon-perturbative treatment based on the large-N limit, where $N$ is the number\nof matter fields. In this limit, the semi-classical treatment is the leading\ncontribution. Non-linear gravitational effects appear in the next orders and in\nthe first of these, the effects are governed by the two-point correlation\nfunction of the energy-momentum tensor evaluated in the vacuum. Taking this\ncorrelator into account, backward propagated modes are dissipated at a distance\nfrom the horizon $\\propto G\\kappa$ when measured in a freely falling frame.\n($G$ is Newton's constant and $\\kappa$ the surface gravity.)

{"text":"  We considered diffusion-driven processes on small-world networks with\ndistance-dependent random links. The study of diffusion on such networks is\nmotivated by transport on randomly folded polymer chains, synchronization\nproblems in task-completion networks, and gradient driven transport on\nnetworks. Changing the parameters of the distance-dependence, we found a rich\nphase diagram, with different transient and recurrent phases in the context of\nrandom walks on networks. We performed the calculations in two limiting cases:\nin the annealed case, where the rearrangement of the random links is fast, and\nin the quenched case, where the link rearrangement is slow compared to the\nmotion of the random walker or the surface. It has been well-established that\nin a large class of interacting systems, adding an arbitrarily small density\nof, possibly long-range, quenched random links to a regular lattice interaction\ntopology, will give rise to mean-field (or annealed) like behavior. In some\ncases, however, mean-field scaling breaks down, such as in diffusion or in the\nEdwards-Wilkinson process in \"low-dimensional\" small-world networks. This\nbreak-down can be understood by treating the random links perturbatively, where\nthe mean-field (or annealed) prediction appears as the lowest-order term of a\nnaive perturbation expansion. The asymptotic analytic results are also\nconfirmed numerically by employing exact numerical diagonalization of the\nnetwork Laplacian.

{"text":"  In a previous work (M. Campisi. Stud. Hist. Phil. M. P. 36 (2005) 275-290) we\nhave addressed the mechanical foundations of equilibrium thermodynamics on the\nbasis of the Generalized Helmholtz Theorem. It was found that the volume\nentropy provides a good mechanical analogue of thermodynamic entropy because it\nsatisfies the heat theorem and it is an adiabatic invariant. This property\nexplains the ``equal'' sign in Clausius principle ($S_f \\geq S_i$) in a purely\nmechanical way and suggests that the volume entropy might explain the ``larger\nthan'' sign (i.e. the Law of Entropy Increase) if non adiabatic transformations\nwere considered. Based on the principles of microscopic (quantum or classical)\nmechanics here we prove that, provided the initial equilibrium satisfy the\nnatural condition of decreasing ordering of probabilities, the expectation\nvalue of the volume entropy cannot decrease for arbitrary transformations\nperformed by some external sources of work on a insulated system. This can be\nregarded as a rigorous quantum mechanical proof of the Second Law. We discuss\nhow this result relates to the Minimal Work Principle and improves over\nprevious attempts. The natural evolution of entropy is towards larger values\nbecause the natural state of matter is at positive temperature.

{"text":"  It has been speculated that quantum gravity might induce a \"foamy\" space-time\nstructure at small scales, randomly perturbing the propagation phases of\nfree-streaming particles (such as kaons, neutrons, or neutrinos). Particle\ninterferometry might then reveal non-standard decoherence effects, in addition\nto standard ones (due to, e.g., finite source size and detector resolution.) In\nthis work we discuss the phenomenology of such non-standard effects in the\npropagation of electron neutrinos in the Sun and in the long-baseline reactor\nexperiment KamLAND, which jointly provide us with the best available probes of\ndecoherence at neutrino energies E ~ few MeV. In the solar neutrino case, by\nmeans of a perturbative approach, decoherence is shown to modify the standard\n(adiabatic) propagation in matter through a calculable damping factor. By\nassuming a power-law dependence of decoherence effects in the energy domain\n(E^n with n = 0,+\/-1,+\/-2), theoretical predictions for two-family neutrino\nmixing are compared with the data and discussed. We find that neither solar nor\nKamLAND data show evidence in favor of non-standard decoherence effects, whose\ncharacteristic parameter gamma_0 can thus be significantly constrained.

Through the use\nof an analytic wind clumping model, we predict the time evolution of the linear\npolarimetry over a large parameter space. We concentrate on the Luminous Blue\nVariables, which display the greatest amount of polarimetric variability and\nfor which we recently conducted a spectropolarimetric survey.

We find\nthat fitting accuracy depends sensitively on galaxy profile shape. Exponential\ndisks are well fit with Sersic models and have small measurement errors,\nwhereas fits to de Vaucouleurs profiles show larger uncertainties owing to the\nlarge amount of light at large radii. We find that both codes provide reliable\nfits and little systematic error, when the effective surface brightness is\nabove that of the sky. Moreover, both codes return errors that significantly\nunderestimate the true fitting uncertainties, which are best estimated with\nsimulations.

We find that relativistic\nEMRBs (v_{max}}\/c > 0.25) are not rare and actually account for approximately\nhalf of the events in our astrophysical model. The relativistic corrections\ntend to significantly change the waveform amplitude and phase relative to a\nNewtonian description, although some of this dephasing could be mimicked by\nparameter errors. The dephasing over several bursts could be of particular\nimportance not only to gravitational wave detection, but also to parameter\nestimation, since it is highly correlated to the spin of the massive black\nhole. Consequently, we postulate that if a relativistic EMRB is detected, such\ndephasing might be used to probe the relativistic character of the massive\nblack hole and obtain information about its spin.\n"}
{"text":"  We study the statistical behavior of two out of equilibrium systems. The\nfirst one is a quasi one-dimensional gas with two species of particles under\nthe action of an external field which drives each species in opposite\ndirections. The second one is a one-dimensional spin system with nearest\nneighbor interactions also under the influence of an external driving force.\nBoth systems show a dynamical scaling with domain formation. The statistical\nbehavior of these domains is compared with models based on the coalescing\nrandom walk and the interacting random walk. We find that the scaling domain\nsize distribution of the gas and the spin systems is well fitted by the Wigner\nsurmise, which lead us to explore a possible connection between these systems\nand the circular orthogonal ensemble of random matrices. However, the study of\nthe correlation function of the domain edges, show that the statistical\nbehavior of the domains in both gas and spin systems, is not completely well\ndescribed by circular orthogonal ensemble, nor it is by other models proposed\nsuch as the coalescing random walk and the interacting random walk.\nNevertheless, we find that a simple model of independent intervals describe\nmore closely the statistical behavior of the domains formed in these systems.\n"}
{"text":"  Room temperature ferromagnetism is observed in undoped TiO2 films deposited\non Si substrates using pulsed laser deposition (PLD). The ferromagnetic\nproperties of the samples depend on the oxygen partial pressure during the PLD\nsynthesis. The appearance of higher binding energy component (HBEC) in the\noxygen 1s core peak from x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) suggests the\npresence of oxygen vacancies in these samples. The amount of oxygen during the\nsynthesis determines the vacancy concentration in the samples which is directly\nrelated to the magnetic behavior of the samples. The magnetic moment decreases\nwith oxygen vacancy concentration in the samples. Valence band measurements\nwere performed to study the electronic structure of both stoichometric and\nreduced TiO2. The analyses show the presence of Ti 3d band near the Fermi level\nin reduced TiO2 samples. These bands are otherwise empty in stoichiometric TiO2\nand reside in the conduction band which makes them unobservable by XPS. The\nexistence of this Ti 3d band near the Fermi level can possibly lead to Stoner\nsplitting of the band.\n"}

In this part of the article we use essentially the concept of\nharmonic section in a sphere bundle with respect to an Euclidean connection.\n  Second, we concentrate on moduli spaces of instantons on definite 4-manifolds\nwith arbitrary first Betti number. We prove strong generic regularity results\nwhich imply (for bundles with \"odd\" first Chern class) the existence of a\nconnected, dense open set of \"good\" metrics for which all the reductions in the\nUhlenbeck compactification of the moduli space are simultaneously regular.\nThese results can be used to define new Donaldson type invariants for definite\n4-manifolds. The idea behind this construction is to notice that, for a good\nmetric $g$, the geometry of the instanton moduli spaces around the reduction\nloci is always the same, independently of the choice of $g$. The connectedness\nof the space of good metrics is important, in order to prove that no\nwall-crossing phenomena (jumps of invariants) occur. Moreover, we notice that,\nfor low instanton numbers, the corresponding moduli spaces are a priori compact\nand contain no reductions at all so, in these cases, the existence of\nwell-defined Donaldson type invariants is obvious. The natural question is to\ndecide whether these new Donaldson type invariants yield essentially new\ndifferential topological information on the base manifold have, or have a\npurely topological nature.\n"}

The Schroedinger equation is solved by\nadiabatic expansion, using the conventional adiabatic approximation as a\nstarting point, and re-inserting the result into the Schroedinger equation to\nyield a second order correction. Closed expressions for arbitrary pulse shapes\nand diffraction orders are obtained and the losses of the population to output\nstates otherwise forbidden by the Bragg condition are derived.

{"text":"  The first goal of the article is to solve several fundamental problems in the\ntheory of holomorphic bundles over non-algebraic manifolds: For instance we\nprove that stability and semi-stability are Zariski open properties in families\nwhen the Gauduchon degree map is a topological invariant, or when the parameter\nmanifold is compact. Second we show that, for a generically stable family of\nbundles over a K\\\"ahler manifold, the Petersson-Weil form extends as a closed\npositive current on the whole parameter space of the family. This extension\ntheorem uses classical tools from Yang-Mills theory developed by Donaldson\n(e.g. the Donaldson functional and the heat equation for Hermitian metrics on a\nholomorphic bundle). We apply these results to study families of bundles over a\nK\\\"ahlerian manifold $Y$ parameterized by a non-K\\\"ahlerian surface $X$,\nproving that such families must satisfy very restrictive conditions.

{"text":"  In this paper we obtain general integral formulas for probabilities in the\nasymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) on the integer lattice with nearest\nneighbor hopping rates p to the right and q=1-p to the left.

{"text":"  The magnetic field in an accretion disk is estimated assuming that all of the\nangular momentum within prescribed accretion disk radii is removed by a jet.\nThe magnetic field estimated at the base of the jet is extrapolated to the\nblazar emission region using a model for a relativistic axisymmetric jet\ncombined with some simplifying assumptions based on the relativistic nature of\nthe flow. The extrapolated magnetic field is compared with estimates based upon\nthe synchrotron and inverse Compton emission from three blazars, MKN 501, MKN\n421 and PKS 2155-304. The magnetic fields evaluated from pure synchrotron self-\nCompton models are inconsistent with the magnetic fields extrapolated in this\nway. However, in two cases inverse Compton models in which a substantial part\nof the soft photon field is generated locally agree well, mainly because these\nmodels imply magnetic field strengths which are closer to being consistent with\nPoynting flux dominated jets. This comparison is based on estimating the mass\naccretion rate from the jet energy flux.

{"text":"  In response to the proposed high helium content stars as an explanation for\nthe double main sequence observed in Omega Centauri, we investigated the\nconsequences of such stars elsewhere on the color-magnitude diagram. We\nconcentrated on the horizontal branch where the effects of high helium are\nexpected to show themselves more clearly. In the process, we developed a\nprocedure for comparing the mass loss suffered by differing stellar populations\nin a physically motivated manner. High helium stars in the numbers proposed\nseem absent from the horizontal branch of Omega Centauri unless their mass loss\nhistory is very different from that of the majority metal-poor stars. It is\npossible to generate a double main sequence with existing Omega Centauri stars\nvia accretion of helium rich pollution consistent with the latest AGB ejecta\ntheoretical yields, and such polluted stars are consistent with the observed HB\nmorphology of Omega Centauri. Polluted models are consistent with observed\nmerging of the main sequences as opposed to our models of helium rich stars.\nUsing the (B-R)\/(B+V+R) statistic, we find that the high helium bMS stars\nrequire an age difference compared to the rMS stars that is too great, whereas\nthe pollution scenario stars have no such conflict for inferred Omega Centauri\nmass losses.\n"}
{"text":"  A complete model of helium-like line and continuum emission has been\nincorporated into the plasma simulation code Cloudy. All elements between He\nand Zn are treated, any number of levels can be considered, and radiative and\ncollisional processes are included. This includes photoionization from all\nlevels, line transfer including continuum pumping and destruction by background\nopacities, scattering, and collisional processes. The model is calculated\nself-consistently along with the ionization and thermal structure of the\nsurrounding nebula. The result is a complete line and continuum spectrum of the\nplasma. Here we focus on the ions of the He I sequence and reconsider the\nstandard helium-like X-ray diagnostics. We first consider semi-analytical\npredictions and compare these with previous work in the low-density,\noptically-thin limit. We then perform numerical calculations of helium-like\nX-ray emission (such as is observed in some regions of Seyferts) and predict\nline ratios as a function of ionizing flux, hydrogen density, and column\ndensity. In particular, we demonstrate that, in photoionized plasmas, the\n$R$-ratio, a density indicator in a collisional plasma, depends on the\nionization fraction and is strongly affected by optical depth for large column\ndensities. We also introduce the notion that the $R$-ratio is a measure of the\nincident continuum at UV wavelengths. The $G$-ratio, which is\ntemperature-sensitive in a collisional plasma, is also discussed, and shown to\nbe strongly affected by continuum pumping and optical depth as well.

{"text":"  We calculate eclipsing light curves for accretion flows around a rotating\nblack hole taking into account the atmospheric effects of the companion star.\nIn the cases of no atmospheric effects, the light curves contain the\ninformation of the black hole spin because most of the X-ray photons around 1\nkeV usually come from the blueshifted part of the accretion flow near the black\nhole shadow, and the size and the position of the black hole shadow depend on\nthe spin. In these cases, when most of the emission comes from the vicinity of\nthe event horizon, the light curves become asymmetric at ingress and egress. We\nnext investigate the atmospheric absorption and scattering effects of the\ncompanion stars. By using the solar-type atmospheric model, we have taken into\naccount the atmospheric effects of the companion star, such as the\nphotoionization by HI and HeI. We found that the eclipsing light curves\nobserved at 1 keV possibly contain the information of the black hole spin.\nHowever, in our atmospheric model, the effects of the atmosphere are much\nlarger than the effects of the black hole spin. Therefore, even in the case\nthat the light curves contain the information of the black hole spin, it may be\ndifficult to extract the information of the black hole spin if we do not have\nthe realistic atmospheric profiles, such as the temperature, and the number\ndensities for several elements. Even in such cases, the light-curve asymmetries\ndue to the rotation of the accretion disc exist. Only when we have the reliable\natmospheric model, in principle, the information of the strong-gravity regions,\nsuch as the black hole spin, can be obtained from the eclipsing light curves.\n"}
{"text":"  In this paper, the study of the gravitational collapse of cylindrically\ndistributed two perfect fluid system has been carried out. It is assumed that\nthe collapsing speeds of the two fluids are very large. We explore this\ncondition by using the high-speed approximation scheme. There arise two cases,\ni.e., bounded and vanishing of the ratios of the pressures with densities of\ntwo fluids given by $c_s, d_s$. It is shown that the high-speed approximation\nscheme breaks down by non-zero pressures $p_1, p_2$ when $c_s, d_s$ are bounded\nbelow by some positive constants. The failure of the high-speed approximation\nscheme at some particular time of the gravitational collapse suggests the\nuncertainity on the evolution at and after this time. In the bounded case, the\nnaked singularity formation seems to be impossible for the cylindrical two\nperfect fluids. For the vanishing case, if a linear equation of state is used,\nthe high-speed collapse does not break down by the effects of the pressures and\nconsequently a naked singularity forms.

{"text":"  A transmitter without channel state information (CSI) wishes to send a\ndelay-limited Gaussian source over a slowly fading channel. The source is coded\nin superimposed layers, with each layer successively refining the description\nin the previous one. The receiver decodes the layers that are supported by the\nchannel realization and reconstructs the source up to a distortion. In the\nlimit of a continuum of infinite layers, the optimal power distribution that\nminimizes the expected distortion is given by the solution to a set of linear\ndifferential equations in terms of the density of the fading distribution. In\nthe optimal power distribution, as SNR increases, the allocation over the\nhigher layers remains unchanged; rather the extra power is allocated towards\nthe lower layers. On the other hand, as the bandwidth ratio b (channel uses per\nsource symbol) tends to zero, the power distribution that minimizes expected\ndistortion converges to the power distribution that maximizes expected\ncapacity. While expected distortion can be improved by acquiring CSI at the\ntransmitter (CSIT) or by increasing diversity from the realization of\nindependent fading paths, at high SNR the performance benefit from diversity\nexceeds that from CSIT, especially when b is large.\n"}
{"text":"  A large symmetry group is perhaps experimentally observed in excited hadrons\nwhich includes the chiral group U(2)_L x U(2)_R as a subgroup.

{"text":"  [Abridged] We present an analysis of the scaling relations between X-ray\nproperties and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) parameters for a sample of 24 X-ray\nluminous galaxy clusters observed with Chandra and with measured SZ effect.\nThese objects are in the redshift range 0.14--0.82 and have X-ray bolometric\nluminosity L>10^45 erg\/s. We perform a spatially resolved spectral analysis and\nrecover the density, temperature and pressure profiles of the ICM, just relying\non the spherical symmetry of the cluster and the hydrostatic equilibrium\nhypothesis. We observe that the correlations among X-ray quantities only are in\nagreement with previous results obtained for samples of high-z X-ray luminous\ngalaxy clusters. On the relations involving SZ quantities, we obtain that they\ncorrelate with the gas temperature with a logarithmic slope significantly\nlarger than the predicted value from the self-similar model. The measured\nscatter indicates, however, that the central Compton parameter y_0 is a proxy\nof the gas temperature at the same level of other X-ray quantities like\nluminosity. Our results on the X-ray and SZ scaling relations show a tension\nbetween the quantities more related to the global energy of the system (e.g.\ngas temperature, gravitating mass) and the indicators of the structure of the\nICM (e.g. gas density profile, central Compton parameter y_0), showing the most\nsignificant deviations from the values of the slope predicted from the\nself-similar model in the L-T, L-M_{tot}, M_{gas}-T, y_0-T relations.

A large velocity gradient analysis is applied to SiO\n(2-1), (5-4) and (8-7) data from the PdBI and the Submillimeter Array to\nconstrain the SiO opacity and abundance. The HH212 Class 0 microjet shows\nstriking similarities in collimation and energetic budget with atomic microjets\nfrom T Tauri sources.

{"text":"  Massive stars, supernovae (SNe), and long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs)\nhave a huge impact on their environment.

Despite the fact that metals produced by ``self-enrichment'' in WR\natmospheres exceed the initial -- host galaxy -- metallicity, by orders of\nmagnitude, a particularly strong dependence of the mass-loss rate on the\ninitial metallicity is found for WR stars at sub-solar metallicities (1\/10 --\n1\/100 solar). This provides a significant boost to the collapsar model for\nGRBs, as it may present a viable mechanism to prevent the loss of angular\nmomentum by stellar winds at low metallicity, whilst strong Galactic WR winds\nmay inhibit GRBs occurring at solar metallicities. Furthermore, we discuss\nrecently reported quasi-sinusoidal modulations in the radio lightcurves of SNe\n2001ig and 2003bg.

{"text":"  The favoured progenitors of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are rapidly\nrotating Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars.

Recent observations indicate that GRBs occur\npredominately in low metallicity (Z) environments, which may resolve the\nproblem: lower Z leads to less mass loss, which may inhibit angular momentum\nremoval, allowing WR stars to remain rotating rapidly until collapse. We wish\nto determine whether low Z WR stars rotate on average more rapidly than\nGalactic WR stars, and perform a Very Large Telescope (VLT) linear\nspectropolarimetry survey of WR stars in the low Z environment of the Large\nMagellanic Cloud (LMC) and compare our results with the Galactic sample.

{"text":"  The structural properties of L-alanine amino acid in aqueous solution and in\ncrystalline phase have been studied by means of density-functional\nelectronic-structure and molecular dynamics simulations. The solvated\nzwitterionic structure of L-alanine (+NH3-C2H4-COO-) was systematically\ncompared to the structure of its zwitterionic crystalline analogue acquired\nfrom both computer simulations and experiments. It turns out that the\nstructural properties of an alanine molecule in aqueous solution can differ\nsignificantly from those in crystalline phase, these differences being mainly\nattributed to hydrogen bonding interactions. In particular, we found that the\nlargest difference between the two alanine forms can be seen for the\norientation and bond lengths of the carboxylate (COO-) group: in aqueous\nsolution the C-O bond lengths appear to strongly correlate with the number of\nwater molecules which form hydrogen bonds with the COO- group.

{"text":"  AIM: We have recently developed a microscopic Monte Carlo approach to study\nsurface chemistry on interstellar grains and the morphology of ice mantles. The\nmethod is designed to eliminate the problems inherent in the rate-equation\nformalism to surface chemistry. Here we report the first use of this method in\na chemical model of cold interstellar cloud cores that includes both gas-phase\nand surface chemistry. The surface chemical network consists of a small number\nof diffusive reactions that can produce molecular oxygen, water, carbon\ndioxide, formaldehyde, methanol and assorted radicals. METHOD: The simulation\nis started by running a gas-phase model including accretion onto grains but no\nsurface chemistry or evaporation. The starting surface consists of either flat\nor rough olivine. We introduce the surface chemistry of the three species H, O\nand CO in an iterative manner using our stochastic technique. Under the\nconditions of the simulation, only atomic hydrogen can evaporate to a\nsignificant extent. Although it has little effect on other gas-phase species,\nthe evaporation of atomic hydrogen changes its gas-phase abundance, which in\nturn changes the flux of atomic hydrogen onto grains. The effect on the surface\nchemistry is treated until convergence occurs. We neglect all non-thermal\ndesorptive processes. RESULTS: We determine the mantle abundances of assorted\nmolecules as a function of time through 2x10^5 yr.

{"text":"  Recent studies of the near-infrared (NIR) properties of dwarf irregular\ngalaxies (dIs) and blue compact dwarfs (BCDs) have provided improved estimates\nfor the NIR luminosity of old stellar populations in these galaxies. These can\nbe used to derive gas fractions, and thereby to evaluate how BCDs have evolved\nwith respect to dIs. Oxygen abundances have been derived for four BCDs in the\nVirgo Cluster from a run at Gemini-North in 2003. Combining these new\nabundances with published values, we study the correlations among the\nmetallicity, Ks luminosity, gas mass, baryonic mass, and gas fraction. Within\nerrors, the two types of dwarfs appear to share a common relation between the\noxygen abundance and the luminosity in Ks. The correlation between metallicity\nand the gas fraction is the same for BCDs as for dIs, indicating that BCD\nevolution has been similar to dIs. Since dIs appear to have evolved as isolated\nsystems, the BCD bursts are unlikely to be a consequence of gas infall or\nmerging.\n"}
{"text":"  The dynamical discrete web (DDW), introduced in recent work of Howitt and\nWarren, is a system of coalescing simple symmetric one-dimensional random walks\nwhich evolve in an extra continuous dynamical parameter s. The evolution is by\nindependent updating of the underlying Bernoulli variables indexed by discrete\nspace-time that define the discrete web at any fixed s. In this paper, we study\nthe existence of exceptional (random) values of s where the paths of the web do\nnot behave like usual random walks and the Hausdorff dimension of the set of\nsuch exceptional s. Our results are motivated by those about exceptional times\nfor dynamical percolation in high dimension by H\\\"aggstrom, Peres and Steif,\nand in dimension two by Schramm and Steif. The exceptional behavior of the\nwalks in DDW is rather different from the situation for dynamical random walks\nof Benjamini, H\\\"aggstrom, Peres and Steif. In particular, we prove that there\nare exceptional values of s for which the walk from the origin S^s(n) has\nlimsup S^s(n)\/\\sqrt n \\leq K with a nontrivial dependence of the Hausdorff\ndimension on K. We also discuss how these and other results extend to the\ndynamical Brownian web, a natural scaling limit of DDW. The scaling limit is\nthe focus of a paper in preparation; it was studied by Howitt and Warren and is\nrelated to the Brownian net of Sun and Swart.\n"}
{"text":"  I consider the question of the interaction between a QCD string and the spin\nof a quark or an antiquark on whose worldline the string terminates. The\nproblem is analysed from the point of view of a string representation for the\nexpectation value of a Wilson loop for a spin-half particle. A string\nrepresentation of the super Wilson loop is obtained starting from an effective\nstring representation of a Wilson Loop. The action obtained in this manner is\ninvariant under a worldline supersymmetry and has a boundary term which\ncontains the spin-string interaction. For rectangular loops the spin-string\ninteraction vanishes and there is no spin-spin term in the resulting heavy\nquark potential. On the other hand if an allowance is made for the finite\nintrinsic thickness of the flux-tube, by assuming that the spin-string\ninteraction takes place not just at the boundary of the string world-sheet but\nextends to a distance of the order of the intrinsic thickness of the flux tube,\nthen we do obtain a spin-spin interaction which falls as the fifth power of the\ndistance. Such a term was previously suggested by Kogut and Parisi in the\ncontext of a flux-tube model of confinement.\n"}

The\nreason of appearance of the observed low-energy excitations are the formation\nof an effective potential of oxygen with broad weakly upwards bottom at the xy\nplane of tetragonal symmetry octahedron, which the interstitial atom occupies.\nThe experimental observed features can be understood in the representation of\nhindered quantum gyration of the interstitial atom.

{"text":"  Context: The transient hard X-ray source IGR J11321-5311 was discovered by\nINTEGRAL on June 2005, during observations of the Crux spiral arm. To date,\nthis is the only detection of the source to be reported by any X\/gamma-ray\nmission. Aims: To characterize the behaviour and hence the nature of the source\nthrough temporal and spectral IBIS analysis. Methods: Detailed spectral and\ntemporal analysis has been performed using standard INTEGRAL software OSA\nv.5.1. Results: To date, IGR J11321-5311 has been detected only once. It was\nactive for about 3.5 hours, a short and bright flare lasting about 1.5 hours is\nevident in the IBIS light curve. It reached a peak flux of about 80 mCrab or\n2.2x10E-9 erg cmE-2 sE-1 (20--300 keV),corresponding to a peak luminosity of\n1.1x10E37 erg sE-1 (assuming a distance of 6.5 kpc). During the outburst, the\nsource was detected with a significance of 18 sigma (20--300 keV) and 8 sigma\n(100--300 keV). The spectrum of the total outburst activity (17--300 keV) is\nbest fitted by the sum of a power law (Gamma=0.55+\/-0.18) plus a black body\n(kT=1.0{+0.2}_{-0.3} keV), with no evidence for a break up to 300 keV. A\nspectral analysis at Science Window level revealed an evident hardening of the\nspectrum through the outburst. The IBIS data were searched for pulsations with\nno positive result. Conclusions: The X-ray spectral shape and the flaring\nbehaviour favour the hypothesis that IGR J11321-5311 is an Anomalous X-ray\nPulsar, though a different nature can not be firmly rejected at the present\nstage.\n"}
{"text":"  The magnetic spectrum at high-energies in heavily underdoped\nYBa$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{6.35}$ (T$_{c}$=18 K) has been determined throughout the\nBrillouin zone.

We use the electric drift approximation,\nvalid for low-density plasmas.\n  We linearise the coupled relativistic cold-fluid and Maxwell equations in the\nelectric drift approximation. The non-linear eigenvalue problem for the\nperturbed azimuthal electric field is solved numerically with standard technics\nfor boundary value problems like the shooting method.

In cylindrical geometry, for some special rotation profile, all\nazimuthal modes $l$ are completely suppressed for sufficiently relativistic\nflows.

The total\nintensity image shows a nearly spherical core with ~3\" radius, an S-shaped arm\nextending ~10\" in the northwest to southeast direction, and an extended lobe\ntowards the southwest. The polarization map shows a centro-symmetric vector\nalignment in almost the entire nebula and low polarizations along the S-shaped\narm. These results suggest that the nebula is accompanied by a central star,\nand the S-shaped arm has a physically ring-like structure.

A strong soft excess below 1 keV is observed in the time-averaged\nHETG spectrum, which can be parameterized with a steep power law or a thermal\nmodel. The flux variability at low energies indicates that the origin of the\nsoft excess cannot be entirely ascribed to the circumnuclear diffuse emission,\ndetected by chandra on scales of 20-30 arcsec (22-33 kpc).

For each particle, we determine the\n`enhancement' ratio, defined as the ratio of particle yields per gluon\nfragmentation event compared to quark fragmentation event.

{"text":"  We discuss the findings of a comprehensive imaging and spectroscopic survey\nof the optical emission associated with the supernova remnant 3C 58 (Fesen et\nal. 2007) as they relate to the topic of pre-SN mass loss.

The\nchemical signatures of the two populations also show marked differences. The\nhigh velocity group includes a substantial number of knots with notably higher\n[N II]\/H-alpha ratios not seen in the lower velocity population, suggesting\ngreater nitrogen enrichment in the SN ejecta than in the CSM.

{"text":"  We study the probability of close encounters between stars from a nuclear\ncluster and a massive black hole. The gravitational field of the system is\ndominated by the black hole in its sphere of influence. It is further modified\nby the cluster mean field (a spherical term) and a gaseous disc\/torus (an\naxially symmetric term) causing a secular evolution of stellar orbits via Kozai\noscillations. Intermittent phases of large eccentricity increase the chance\nthat stars become damaged inside the tidal radius of the central hole. Such\nevents can produce debris and lead to recurring episodes of enhanced accretion\nactivity. We introduce an effective loss cone and associate it with tidal\ndisruptions during the high-eccentricity phases of the Kozai cycle. By\nnumerical integration of the trajectories forming the boundary of the loss cone\nwe determine its shape and volume. We also include the effect of relativistic\nadvance of pericentre. The potential of the disc has the efffect of enlarging\nthe loss cone and, therefore, the predicted number of tidally disrupted stars\nshould grow by factor of ~10^2. On the other hand, the effect of the cluster\nmean potential together with the relativistic pericentre advance act against\nthe eccentricity oscillations. In the end we expect the tidal disruption events\nto be approximately ten times more frequent in comparison with the model in\nwhich the three effects -- the cluster mean field, the relativistic pericentre\nadvance, and the Kozai mechanism -- are all ignored. The competition of\ndifferent influences suppresses the predicted star disruption rate as the black\nhole mass increases.

If conventional oil production\npeaks within the next few decades, it may have a large effect on future\natmospheric CO2 and climate change, depending upon subsequent energy choices.\nAssuming that proven oil and gas reserves do not greatly exceed estimates of\nthe Energy Information Administration, and recent trends are toward lower\nestimates, we show that it is feasible to keep atmospheric CO2 from exceeding\nabout 450 ppm by 2100, provided that emissions from coal, unconventional fossil\nfuels, and land use are constrained. Coal-fired power plants without\nsequestration must be phased out before mid-century to achieve this CO2 limit.\nIt is also important to \"stretch\" conventional oil reserves via energy\nconservation and efficiency, thus averting strong pressures to extract liquid\nfuels from coal or unconventional fossil fuels while clean technologies are\nbeing developed for the era \"beyond fossil fuels\". We argue that a rising price\non carbon emissions is needed to discourage conversion of the vast fossil\nresources into usable reserves, and to keep CO2 beneath the 450 ppm ceiling.\n"}
{"text":"  We study the nonlinear evolution of the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in\nthe dark matter power spectrum and correlation function using renormalized\nperturbation theory (RPT). In a previous paper we showed that RPT successfully\npredicts the damping of acoustic oscillations; here we extend our calculation\nto the enhancement of power due to mode-coupling. We show that mode-coupling\ngenerates additional oscillations that are out of phase with those in the\nlinear spectrum, leading to shifts in the scales of oscillation nodes defined\nwith respect to a smooth spectrum. When Fourier transformed, these out of phase\noscillations induce percent-level shifts in the acoustic peak of the two-point\ncorrelation function. We present predictions for these shifts as a function of\nredshift; these should be considered as a robust lower limit to the more\nrealistic case that includes in addition redshift distortions and galaxy bias.\nWe show that these nonlinear effects occur at very large scales, leading to a\nbreakdown of linear theory at scales much larger than commonly thought. We\ndiscuss why virialized halo profiles are not responsible for these effects,\nwhich can be understood from basic physics of gravitational instability. Our\nresults are in excellent agreement with numerical simulations, and can be used\nas a starting point for modeling BAO in future observations. To meet this end,\nwe suggest a simple physically motivated model to correct for the shifts caused\nby mode-coupling.\n"}
{"text":"  A discrete tensegrity framework can be thought of as a graph in Euclidean\nn-space where each edge is of one of three types: an edge with a fixed length\n(bar) or an edge with an upper (cable) or lower (strut) bound on its length.\nRoth and Whiteley, in their 1981 paper \"Tensegrity Frameworks\", showed that in\ncertain cases, the struts and cables can be replaced with bars when analyzing\nthe framework for infinitesimal rigidity. In that case we call the tensegrity\n\"bar equivalent\". In specific, they showed that if there exists a set of\npositive weights, called a positive \"stress\", on the edges such that the\nweighted sum of the edge vectors is zero at every vertex, then the tensegrity\nis bar equivalent.\n  In this paper we consider an extended version of the tensegrity framework in\nwhich the vertex set is a (possibly infinite) set of points in Euclidean\nn-space and the edgeset is a compact set of unordered pairs of vertices. These\nare called \"continuous tensegrities\". We show that if a continuous tensegrity\nhas a strictly positive stress, it is bar equivalent and that it has a\nsemipositive stress if and only if it is partially bar equivalent. We also show\nthat if a tensegrity is minimally bar equivalent (it is bar equivalent but\nremoving any open set of edges makes it no longer so), then it has a strictly\npositive stress.\n  In particular, we examine the case where the vertices form a rectifiable\ncurve and the possible motions of the curve are limited to local isometries of\nit. Our methods provide an attractive proof of the following result: There is\nno locally arclength preserving motion of a circle that increases any antipodal\ndistance without decreasing some other one.\n"}
{"text":"  For cellular biochemical reaction systems where the numbers of molecules is\nsmall, significant noise is associated with chemical reaction events. This\nmolecular noise can give rise to behavior that is very different from the\npredictions of deterministic rate equation models. Unfortunately, there are few\nanalytic methods for examining the qualitative behavior of stochastic systems.\nHere we describe such a method that extends deterministic analysis to include\nleading-order corrections due to the molecular noise. The method allows the\nsteady-state behavior of the stochastic model to be easily computed,\nfacilitates the mapping of stability phase diagrams that include stochastic\neffects and reveals how model parameters affect noise susceptibility, in a\nmanner not accessible to numerical simulation. By way of illustration we\nconsider two genetic circuits: a bistable positive-feedback loop and a\nnegative-feedback oscillator. We find in the positive feedback circuit that\ntranslational activation leads to a far more stable system than transcriptional\ncontrol. Conversely, in a negative-feedback loop triggered by a\npositive-feedback switch, the stochasticity of transcriptional control is\nharnessed to generate reproducible oscillations.\n"}

In fact, they\noften make headlines, by discussing and discovering evidence about political\nevents and facts. Often blogs link to one another, creating a publicly\navailable record of how information and influence spreads through an underlying\nsocial network. Aggregating links from several blog posts creates a directed\ngraph which we analyze to discover the patterns of information propagation in\nblogspace, and thereby understand the underlying social network.

The HI distribution shows different topology at four\ndifferent chosen scales. At the smallest scales explored (19-29 pc), the HI\nmass is distributed in such a way that numerous clumps are embedded on top of a\nlow density background. At the larger scales from 73 to 194 pc, it shows a\ngeneric hole topology. These holes might have been formed mainly by stellar\nwinds from hot stars. At the scales from 240 to 340 pc, slightly above the disk\nscale-height of the gaseous disk, major clumps in the HI map change the\ndistribution to have a slight clump topology. These clumps include the giant\ncloud associations in the spiral arms and the thick filaments surrounding\nsuperholes. At the largest scales studied (390-485 pc), the hole topology is\npresent again.

However, two-photon interactions such as two-photon absorption (TPA)\nand sum-frequency generation (SFG) can exhibit such a behavior even at high\npower levels, as long as the final state (i.e. the atomic level in TPA, or the\ngenerated light in SFG) is narrowband enough.

The key features of CLIO are\nthat it locates Kamioka underground site for low seismic noise level, and\nadopts cryogenic Sapphire mirrors for low thermal noise level. The first\noperation of the cryogenic interferometer was successfully demonstrated in\nFebruary of 2006. Current sensitivity at room temperature is close to the\ntarget sensitivity within a factor of 4. Several observation experiments at\nroom temperature have been done.

{"text":"  The intrinsic fraction of broad absorption line quasars (BALQSOs) is\nimportant in constraining geometric and evolutionary models of quasars. We\npresent the fraction of BALQSOs in 2MASS detected quasars within the SDSS DR3\nsample in the redshift range of 1.7 < z < 4.38. The fraction of BALQSOs is\n40.4^{+3.4}_{-3.3}% in the 2MASS 99% database K_s band completeness sample, and\n38.5^{+1.7}_{-1.7}% in the larger 2MASS sample extending below the completeness\nlimit. These fractions are significantly higher than the 26% reported in the\noptical bands for the same parent sample. We also present the fraction of\nBALQSOs as functions of apparent magnitudes, absolute magnitudes, and redshift\nin the 2MASS and SDSS bands. The 2MASS fractions are consistently higher than\nthe SDSS fractions in every comparison, and the BALQSO fractions steadily\nincrease with wavelength from the SDSS u to the 2MASS K_s bands. Furthermore,\nthe i - K_s color distributions of BALQSOs and non-BALQSOs indicate that\nBALQSOs are redder than non-BALQSOs, with a K-S test probability of 2e-12.\nThese results are consistent with the spectral difference between BALQSOs and\nnon-BALQSOs including both the absorption troughs and dust extinction in\nBALQSOs, which leads to significant selection biases against BALQSOs in the\noptical bands. Using a simple simulation incorporating the luminosity function\nof quasars and the amount of obscuration for BALQSOs, we simultaneously fit the\nBALQSO fractions in the SDSS and 2MASS bands. We obtain a true BALQSO fraction\nof 43\\pm2% for luminous quasars (M_{K_s} \\lesssim -30.1 mag).\n"}
{"text":"  In contrast to the Euler-Poincar{\\'e} reduction of geodesic flows of left- or\nright-invariant metrics on Lie groups to the corresponding Lie algebra (or its\ndual), one can consider the reduction of the geodesic flows to the group\nitself. The reduced vector field has a remarkable hydrodynamic interpretation:\nit is a velocity field for a stationary flow of an ideal fluid. Right- or\nleft-invariant symmetry fields of the reduced field define vortex manifolds for\nsuch flows.\n  Consider now a mechanical system, whose configuration space is a Lie group\nand whose Lagrangian is invariant to left translations on that group, and\nassume that the mass geometry of the system may change under the action of\ninternal control forces. Such system can also be reduced to the Lie group. With\nno controls, this mechanical system describes a geodesic flow of the\nleft-invariant metric, given by the Lagrangian, and thus its reduced flow is a\nstationary ideal fluid flow on the Lie group. The standard control problem for\nsuch system is to find the conditions, under which the system can be brought\nfrom any initial position in the configuration space to another preassigned\nposition by changing its mass geometry. We show that under these conditions, by\nchanging the mass geometry, one can also bring one vortex manifold to any other\npreassigned vortex manifold.\n"}

Being an\nold and rich cluster, M67 is a relevant object for the analysis of the Galactic\ndisk evolution. M67 is well studied but the lack of a wide and deep Stromgren\nphotometric study makes our results worthwhile. The brightest stars of the open\ncluster M67 were used as uvby-Hbeta standard stars in our studies of NGC1817\nand NGC2548, and the extension of the field covered, as well as the amount of\nobservations, allowed to obtain the best set of Stromgren data ever published\nfor this cluster. We discuss the results of our CCD uvby-Hbeta\nintermediate-band photometry, covering an area of about 50'x50' down to V 19.\nMoreover, a complete membership segregation based on astrometric and\nphotometric criteria is obtained.

For small disorders we develop a\nperturbative technique which enables us to compute explicitly the averaged\ntemperature (energy) of the pinning transition. For strong disorder we compute\nthe transition point both numerically and using the renormalization group\napproach. Our consideration is based on the following idea: the random\npotential can be viewed as a periodic potential with the period $n$ in the\nlimit $n\\to\\infty$. The advantage of our approach stems from the ability to\nintegrate exactly over all spatial degrees of freedoms in the model and to\nreduce the initial problem to the analysis of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of\nsome special non-Hermitian random matrix with disorder--dependent diagonal and\nconstant off-diagonal coefficients. We show that even for strong disorder the\nshift of the averaged pinning point of the random walk in the ensemble of\nrandom realizations of substrate disorder is indistinguishable from the pinning\npoint of the system with preaveraged (i.e. annealed) Boltzmann weight.\n"}
{"text":"  Medvedev and Melott (2007) have suggested that periodicity in fossil\nbiodiversity may be induced by cosmic rays which vary as the Solar System\noscillates normal to the galactic disk. We re-examine the evidence for a 62\nmillion year (Myr) periodicity in biodiversity throughout the Phanerozoic\nhistory of animal life reported by Rohde & Mueller (2005), as well as related\nquestions of periodicity in origination and extinction. We find that the signal\nis robust against variations in methods of analysis, and is based on\nfluctuations in the Paleozoic and a substantial part of the Mesozoic.\nExamination of origination and extinction is somewhat ambiguous, with results\ndepending upon procedure. Origination and extinction intensity as defined by RM\nmay be affected by an artifact at 27 Myr in the duration of stratigraphic\nintervals. Nevertheless, when a procedure free of this artifact is implemented,\nthe 27 Myr periodicity appears in origination, suggesting that the artifact may\nultimately be based on a signal in the data. A 62 Myr feature appears in\nextinction, when this same procedure is used. We conclude that evidence for a\nperiodicity at 62 Myr is robust, and evidence for periodicity at approximately\n27 Myr is also present, albeit more ambiguous.\n"}
{"text":"  We establish the first hardness results for the problem of computing the\nvalue of one-round games played by a verifier and a team of provers who can\nshare quantum entanglement. In particular, we show that it is NP-hard to\napproximate within an inverse polynomial the value of a one-round game with (i)\nquantum verifier and two entangled provers or (ii) classical verifier and three\nentangled provers. Previously it was not even known if computing the value\nexactly is NP-hard. We also describe a mathematical conjecture, which, if true,\nwould imply hardness of approximation to within a constant.\n  We start our proof by describing two ways to modify classical multi-prover\ngames to make them resistant to entangled provers. We then show that a strategy\nfor the modified game that uses entanglement can be ``rounded'' to one that\ndoes not. The results then follow from classical inapproximability bounds.

We use here the word `generator' in the broader\nsense of the word. Such a representation can be any real representation of\nSO(N) with the positive definite metric, satisfying (T^I)^{i j} = - (T^I)^{j i}\nand (T^I)^{[ i j |} (T^I)^{| k ] l} \\equiv 0. The first non-trivial examples\nare the spinorial 8_S and conjugate spinorial 8_C representations of SO(8)\nconsistent with supersymmetry. We further couple the system to chiral\nmultiplets, and show that a Higgs mechanism can give positive definite (mass)^2\nto the new gauge fields for U^i.

{"text":"  It is proposed that radiation belts similar to the ones in the planetary\nmagnetosphere can exist for a pulsar with a relatively long period and a strong\nmagnetic field.

The\ntrapped plasma can be supplied and replenished by either direct injection of\nrelativistic pairs from acceleration of externally-supplied particles in a\ndormant outer gap or in situ ionization of the accreted neutral material in the\ntrapping region. The radiation belts can be disrupted by waves that are excited\nin the region as the result of plasma instabilities or emitted from the surface\ndue to starquakes or stellar oscillations. The disruption can cause an\nintermittent particle precipitation toward the star producing radio bursts. It\nis suggested that such bursts may be seen as rotating radio transients (RRATs).\n"}
{"text":"  Numerous ongoing experiments aim at detecting WIMP dark matter particles from\nthe galactic halo directly through WIMP-nucleon interactions. Once such a\ndetection is established a confirmation of the galactic origin of the signal is\nneeded. This requires a direction-sensitive detector.

Baryonic matter has beta=0 and therefore a detection of a\nnonzero beta would be strong proof of the fundamental difference between dark\nand baryonic matter. We estimate the sensitivity for various detector\nconfigurations using Monte Carlo methods and we show that the strongest signal\nis found in the relatively few high recoil energy events. Measuring beta to the\nprecision of ~0.03 will require detecting more than 10^4 WIMP events with\nnuclear recoil energies greater than 100 keV for a WIMP mass of 100 GeV and a\n32S target.

It was, however, the perceived difference between those two\ntheorems that sparked the 1874 controversy. Focusing on this quarrel allows us\nto explore the algebraic identity of the polynomial practices of the\nmanipulations of forms in use before the advent of structural approaches to\nlinear algebra. The latter approaches identified these practices with methods\nfor the classification of similar matrices. We show that the prac- tices --\nJordan's canonical reduction and Kronecker's invariant computation -- reflect\nidentities inseparable from the social context of the time. Moreover, these\npractices reveal not only tacit knowledge, local ways of thinking, but also --\nin light of a long history tracing back to the work of Lagrange, Laplace, Cau-\nchy, and Hermite -- two internal philosophies regarding the significance of\ngenerality which are inseparable from two disciplinary ideals opposing algebra\nand arithmetic.

{"text":"  We have carried out a survey toward the central regions of 85 starless cores\nin HCN J = 1-0 to study inward motions in the cores. Sixty-four cores were\ndetected with HCN lines.

We found close\nrelation between the intensities of the HCN and N2H+ lines. This implies that\nthe HCN is not much depleted in the central regions of the cores. In some\ncores, the HCN spectra show different sign of asymmetry from other molecular\nlines. A few cores show various signs of asymmetry in individual HCN hyperfine\nlines. The distribution of the velocity shift dV of the HCN profiles with\nrespect to the systemic velocity of the optically thin tracer is found to be\nmore shifted toward bluer side than those of other infall tracers, indicating\nthat the HCN traces inward motions more frequently. The dV distribution of each\nHCN hyperfine line for all sources is similar. Moreover the dV values obtained\nfrom different HCN hyperfine lines for each source are nearly similar. These\nmay mean that most of starless cores are in similar kinematic states across the\nlayers of the cores.

Furthermore, the quantum theories determined by\nsuch Hamiltonians have been shown to be consistent in the sense that the\nprobabilities are positive and the dynamical trajectories are unitary.

{"text":"  (abridged) The soft excess seen in the X-ray spectra of many high mass\naccretion rate AGN can be well modelled by reflection from a partially ionised\naccretion disc. However, the derived parameters are often extreme, both in\nterms of the underlying spacetime and the reflection geometry, and these models\nrequire that the disc is far from hydrostatic equilibrium. An alternative model\nuses similarly partially ionised, velocity smeared material but seen in\nabsorption, though again the derived velocities are extreme, requiring magnetic\ndriving (in the jet?) rather than a simple line driven disc wind. We find that\nwhile both models give comparably good fits to XMM--Newton data, we favour the\nabsorption model as, unlike reflection, all the derived spectral indices are\nsoft. This is as expected by analogy with the correspondingly high mass\naccretion rate stellar mass black holes. Furthermore, these X-ray spectra are\nconsistent with a one--to--one mapping between AGN type and spectral state,\nwith NLS1's having softer spectra corresponding to the very high state, while\nthe broad line AGN have Gamma~2 as expected for the high\/soft state. We also\nuse the simultaneous OM data to derive the ratio of disc to total accretion\npower which is another tracer of spectral state in X-ray binaries. This does\nnot always show that the disc in NLS1's contributes less than 80 per cent of\nthe total power, as expected for a very high state.

The X-ray spectra are consistent with heavily absorbed power laws\n(21.8 < log NH < 23.4), and all of them appear to be absorbed AGN. The majority\nof the sources show only narrow emission lines in their optical spectra,\nimplying that they are type-2 AGN. Only a small fraction of the sources (7\/42)\nshow broad optical emission lines, and all of these have NH < 10^23 cm^-2. This\nimplies that ratios of X-ray absorption to optical\/UV extinction equivalent to\n> 100 times the Galactic gas-to-dust ratio are rare in AGN absorbers (at most a\nfew percent of the population), and may be restricted to broad absorption-line\nQSOs. Seven objects appear to have an additional soft X-ray component in\naddition to the heavily absorbed power law. We consider the implications of our\nresults in the light of the AGN unified scheme. We find that the soft\ncomponents in narrow-line objects are consistent with the unified scheme\nprovided that > 4 per cent of broad-line AGN have ionised absorbers that\nattenuate their soft X-ray flux by >50 per cent. In at least one of the X-ray\nabsorbed, broad-line AGN in our sample the X-ray spectrum requires an ionised\nabsorber, consistent with this picture.\n"}

{"text":"  The photospheres of stars hosting planets have larger metallicity than stars\nlacking planets. In the present work we study the possibility of an earlier\nmetal enrichment of the photospheres by means of impacting planetesimals during\nthe first 20-30Myr. Here we explore this contamination process by simulating\nthe interactions of an inward migrating planet with a disc of planetesimal\ninterior to its orbit. The results show the percentage of planetesimals that\nfall on the star. We identified the dependence of the planet's eccentricity\n($e_p$) and time scale of migration ($\\tau$) on the rate of infalling\nplanetesimals. For very fast migrations ($\\tau=10^2$yr and $\\tau=10^3$yr) there\nis no capture in mean motion resonances, independently of the value of $e_p$.\nThen, due to the planet's migration the planetesimals suffer close approaches\nwith the planet and more than 80% of them are ejected from the system. For slow\nmigrations ($\\tau=10^5$yr and $\\tau=10^6$yr) the percentage of collisions with\nthe planet decrease with the increase of the planet's eccentricity. For $e_p=0$\nand $e_p=0.1$ most of the planetesimals were captured in the 2:1 resonance and\nmore than 65% of them collided with the star. Whereas migration of a Jupiter\nmass planet to very short pericentric distances requires unrealistic high disc\nmasses, these requirements are much smaller for smaller migrating planets.

{"text":"  In this paper, it is shown that the cosmological model that was introduced in\na sequence of three earlier papers under the title, A Dust Universe Solution to\nthe Dark Energy Problem, can be used to resolve the problem of the great\nmismatch of numerical values between dark energy from cosmology and zero point\nenergy from quantum theory. It is shown that, if the zero point energies for\nthe cosmic microwave background and for all the rest of the universe that is\nnot cosmic microwave background are introduced into this model as two entities,\ntheir separate values appear within this theory in the form of a numerical\ndifference. It is this difference that gives the numerical value for the zero\npoint value of Einstein's dark energy density. Consequently, although the two\nzero point energies may be large, their difference can give the known small\ndark energy value from cosmology for dark energy density. Issues relating to\ninterpretation, calculation and measurement associated with this result and an\ninterpretation of dark energy as a measure of polarisation of the vacuum are\ndiscussed.

{"text":"  By 2D hydrodynamic simulations including a detailed equation of state and\nneutrino transport, we investigate the interplay between different non-radial\nhydrodynamic instabilities that play a role during the postbounce accretion\nphase of collapsing stellar cores. The convective mode of instability, which is\ndriven by negative entropy gradients caused by neutrino heating or by time\nvariations of the shock strength, can be identified clearly by the development\nof typical Rayleigh-Taylor mushrooms. However, in cases where the gas in the\npostshock region is rapidly advected towards the gain radius, the growth of\nsuch a buoyancy instability can be suppressed. In such a situation the shocked\nflow nevertheless can develop non-radial asymmetry with an oscillatory growth\nof the amplitude. This phenomenon has been termed ``standing accretion shock\ninstability'' (SASI). It is shown here that the SASI oscillations can trigger\nconvective instability and like the latter they lead to an increase of the\naverage shock radius and of the mass in the gain layer. Both hydrodynamic\ninstabilities in combination stretch the advection time of matter through the\nneutrino-heating layer and thus enhance the neutrino energy deposition in\nsupport of the neutrino-driven explosion mechanism. A rapidly contracting and\nmore compact nascent NS turns out to be favorable for explosions, because the\naccretion luminosity and neutrino heating are larger and the growth rate of the\nSASI is higher. Moreover, we show that the oscillation period of the SASI and a\nvariety of other features in our simulations agree with estimates for the\nadvective-acoustic cycle (AAC), in which perturbations are carried by the\naccretion flow from the shock to the neutron star and pressure waves close an\namplifying global feedback loop.

The most likely\ncandidate mechanism is the attractor network, and a great deal of effort has\ngone toward investigating it theoretically. Yet, despite almost a quarter\ncentury of intense work, attractor networks are not fully understood. In\nparticular, there are still two unanswered questions.

Then we compute analytically the probability distribution\nof these fluctuations. We show that, for every system of fixed and finite $N$,\nfluctuations about the equilibrium distribution do, in fact, depend on the\ntemperature. Indeed, at higher temperatures the fluctuations can be so large\nthat the system does not fully converge on the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution\nbut actually fluctuates around it.

The SO2 images\nreveal the presence of a hot core internally heated by an intermediate mass\nprotostar, and a circumstellar rotating disk around the HW2 radio jet with size\n600AUx100AU and mass of 1M_sun. Keplerian rotation for the disk velocity\ngradient of 5 kms-1 requires a 9 M_sun central star, which cannot explain the\ntotal luminosity observed in the region. This may indicate that the disk does\nnot rotate with a Keplerian law due to the extreme youth of this object.

From the morphology and\nlocation of this free-free continuum emission at centimeter and millimeter\nwavelengths (spectral index of 0.4-1.5), we propose that the disk is\nphotoevaporating due to the UV radiation from the central star.

We use the Toulouse limit to exactly calculate the adiabatically pumped\nspin current in the Kondo regime. In the absence of both potential scattering\nand a voltage bias, the instantaneous charge current is strictly zero for a\ngeneric Kondo model. However, a nonzero spin current can be pumped through the\nsystem in the presence of a finite magnetic field, provided the spin couples\nasymmetrically to the two leads. Tunneling through a Kondo impurity thus offers\na natural mechanism for generating a pure spin current.

The HI distribution is mildly asymmetric\nand, although slightly offset from the photometric center, roughly follows the\noptical brightness distribution, extending to over 1.2 Holmberg radii (where\nmu_B = 26.5 mag\/arcsec^2). In particular, the highest HI column densities\nclosely follow the bar, one-arm spiral, and a third optical extension. The\nrotation is solid-body in the inner parts but flattens outside of the optical\nextent. The total HI flux F_HI = 23.1 pm 1.2 Jy km\/s, yielding a total HI mass\nM_HI= (6.4 pm 1.7) x 10^8 Msun (for a distance D = 10.8 pm 1.4 Mpc) and a total\nHI mass-to-blue-luminosity ratio M_HI\/L_B = (0.96 pm 0.14) Msun \/ Lsun,B\n(distance independent). The HI data suggest a very complex small-scale HI\nstructure, with evidence of large shells and\/or holes, but deeper observations\nare required for a detailed study. Follow-up observations are also desirable\nfor a proper comparison with the Large Magellanic Cloud, where despite an\noptical morphology very similar to ESO 364-G 029 the HI bears little\nresemblance to the optical.\n"}
{"text":"  We present the results of the analysis of an archival 15 ks XMM-Newton\nobservation of the nearby (z=0.057) radio-loud source 3C445, optically\nclassified as a Broad-Line Radio Galaxy. While the RGS data are of insufficient\nquality to allow a meaningful analysis, the EPIC data show a remarkable X-ray\nspectrum. The 2-10 keV continuum is described by a heavily absorbed (Nh~ 1e22 -\n1e23 cm-2) power law with photon index Gamma ~1.4, and strong (R~2) cold\nreflection. A narrow, unresolved Fe Kalpha emission line is detected,\nconfirming previous findings, with EW 120eV. A soft excess is present below 2\nkeV over the extrapolation of the hard X-ray power law, which we model with a\npower law with the same photon index as the hard power law, absorbed by a\ncolumn density Nh=6e20 cm-2 in excess to Galactic. A host of emission lines are\npresent below 2 keV, confirming previous indications from ASCA, due to H- and\nHe-like O, Mg, and Si. We attribute the origin of the lines to a photoionized\ngas, with properties very similar to radio-quiet obscured AGN. Two different\nionized media, or a single stratified medium, are required to fit the soft\nX-ray data satisfactorily. The similarity of the X-ray spectrum of 3C445 to\nSeyferts underscores that the central engines of radio-loud and radio-quiet AGN\nsimilarly host both cold and warm gas.\n"}

{"text":"  The astrometric signature imposed by a planet on its primary increases\nsubstantially towards longer periods (proportinal to P^2\/3), so that\nlong-period planets can be more easily detected, in principle.

Such position accuracies can now be obtained with both ground-based and\nspace-based telescopes. The difficulty was that it often takes many decades\nbefore a detectable position shift will occur. However, by the time the next\ngeneration of astrometric missions such as SIM will be taking data, several\ndecades will have past since the first astrometric mission, HIPPARCOS. Here we\npropose to use a new astrometric method that employs a future, highly accurate\nSIM Quick-Look survey and HIPPARCOS data taken twenty years prior. Using\nposition errors for SIM of 4 muas, this method enables the detection and\ncharacterization of Solar-system analogs (SOSAs) with periods up to 240 (500)\nyears for 1 (10) M_J companions. Because many tens of thousands nearby stars\ncan be surveyed this way for a modest expenditure of SIM time and SOSAs may be\nquite abundant, we expect to find many hundreds of extra-solar planets with\nlong-period orbits.

{"text":"  We here develop an improved way of using a rotating star as a clock, set it\nusing the Sun, and demonstrate that it keeps time well. This technique, called\ngyrochronology, permits the derivation of ages for solar- and late-type main\nsequence stars using only their rotation periods and colors. The technique is\nclarified and developed here, and used to derive ages for illustrative groups\nof nearby, late-type field stars with measured rotation periods. We first\ndemonstrate the reality of the interface sequence, the unifying feature of the\nrotational observations of cluster and field stars that makes the technique\npossible, and extends it beyond the proposal of Skumanich by specifying the\nmass dependence of rotation for these stars. We delineate which stars it cannot\ncurrently be used on. We then calibrate the age dependence using the Sun. The\nerrors are propagated to understand their dependence on color and period.\nRepresentative age errors associated with the technique are estimated at ~15%\n(plus possible systematic errors) for late-F, G, K, & early-M stars. Ages\nderived via gyrochronology for the Mt. Wilson stars are shown to be in good\nagreement with chromospheric ages for all but the bluest stars, and probably\nsuperior. Gyro ages are then calculated for each of the active main sequence\nfield stars studied by Strassmeier and collaborators where other ages are not\navailable. These are shown to be mostly younger than 1Gyr, with a median age of\n365Myr. The sample of single, late-type main sequence field stars assembled by\nPizzolato and collaborators is then assessed, and shown to have gyro ages\nranging from under 100Myr to several Gyr, and a median age of 1.2Gyr. Finally,\nwe demonstrate that the individual components of the three wide binaries\nXiBooAB, 61CygAB, & AlphaCenAB yield substantially the same gyro ages.\n"}

We calculate `star formation rate functions' in four different\nredshift slices, splitting also into contributions from the red sequence and\nblue cloud for the first time. We find that the growth of stellar mass since\nz=1 is consistent with the integrated star formation rate. Yet, most of the\nstars formed are in blue cloud galaxies. If the stellar mass already in, and\nformed in, z<1 blue cloud galaxies were to stay in the blue cloud the total\nstellar mass in blue galaxies would be dramatically overproduced.

We explore a simple truncation scenario in which these\n`extra' blue galaxies have their star formation suppressed by an unspecified\nmechanism or mechanisms; simple cessation of star formation in these extra blue\ngalaxies is approximately sufficient to build up the red sequence at M*<10^11\nM_sun.\n"}

In particular, attention has focused on 2-CUSUM harmonic\nmean rules due to the simplicity in calculating their first moments. In this\npaper, we derive closed-form expressions for the first moment of a general\n2-CUSUM stopping rule. We use these expressions to obtain explicit upper and\nlower bounds for it. Moreover, we derive an expression for the rate of change\nof this first moment as one of the threshold parameters changes. Based on these\nexpressions we obtain explicit upper and lower bounds to this rate of change.\nUsing these expressions we are able to find the best 2-CUSUM stopping rule with\nrespect to the extended Lorden criterion. In fact, we demonstrate not only the\nexistence but also the uniqueness of the best 2-CUSUM stopping both in the case\nof a symmetric change and in the case of a non-symmetric case. Furthermore, we\ndiscuss the existence of a modification of the 2-CUSUM stopping rule that has a\nstrictly better performance than its classical 2-CUSUM counterpart for small\nvalues of the mean time between false alarms.

Here, we allow the birth rate to be infinite, that\nis, pairs of birth times and lifespans of newborns form a Poisson point process\nalong the lifetime of their mother, with possibly infinite intensity measure. A\nsplitting tree is a random (so-called) chronological tree. Each element of a\nchronological tree is a (so-called) existence point $(v,\\tau)$ of some\nindividual $v$ (vertex) in a discrete tree, where $\\tau$ is a nonnegative real\nnumber called chronological level (time).

{"text":"  (Abridged) Using cosmological hydrodynamic simulations in combination with\nanalytic modeling, we show that the galaxy stellar mass-metallicity relation\n(MZR) provides strong constraints on galactic outflows across cosmic time. We\ncompare three outflow models: No outflows, a \"constant wind\" (cw) model that\nemulates the popular Dekel & Silk (1986) scenario, and a ``momentum-driven\nwind\" (vzw) model. We find that only the vzw scaling reproduces the observed\nz~2 MZR's slope, amplitude, and scatter. Comparing our fully three-dimensional\nsimulations with a simple one-zone chemical evolution model, we find that the\nMZR can be understood in terms of three parameters: (1) The equilibrium\nmetallicity Z_eq=y*SFR\/ACC (where y=true yield), reflecting the enrichment\nbalance between star formation rate SFR and gas accretion rate ACC; (2) the\ndilution time t_d=M_g\/ACC, representing the timescale for a galaxy to return to\nZ_eq after a metallicity-perturbing interaction; and (3) the blowout mass\nM_blowout, which is the galaxy stellar mass above which winds can escape its\nhalo. When outflows with mass loading factor MLF are present, galaxies below\nM_blowout obey Z_eq = y\/(1+MLF), while above M_blowout, Z_eq->y. Our cw model\nhas M_blowout ~ 10^10 M_sun, which yields a sharp upturn in the MZR above this\nscale and a flat MZR with large scatter below it, in strong disagreement with\nobservations.

{"text":"  We study the structure of the photospheric magnetic field of the quiet Sun by\ninvestigating weak spectro-polarimetric signals. We took a sequence of Stokes\nspectra of the Fe I 630.15 nm and 630.25 nm lines in a region of quiet Sun near\nthe disk center, using the POLIS spectro-polarimeter at the German VTT on\nTenerife. The line cores of these two lines form at different heights in the\natmosphere. The 3$\\sigma$ noise level of the data is about 1.8 $\\times 10^{-3}\nI_{c}$. We present co-temporal and co-spatial Stokes-$V$ profiles of the Fe I\n630 nm line pair, where the two lines show opposite polarities in a single\nspectrum. We compute synthetic line profiles and reproduce these spectra with a\ntwo-component model atmosphere: a non-magnetic component and a magnetic\ncomponent. The magnetic component consists of two magnetic layers with opposite\npolarity: the upper one moves upwards while the lower one moves downward.\nIn-between, there is a region of enhanced temperature. The Stokes-$V$ line pair\nof opposite polarity in a single spectrum can be understood as a magnetic\nreconnection event in the solar photosphere. We demonstrate that such a\nscenario is realistic, but the solution may not be unique.\n"}

{"text":"  Aims. We probe the effect of turbulent diffusion on the chemistry at the\ninterface between a cold neutral medium (CNM) cloudlet and the warm neutral\nmedium (WNM). Methods. We perform moving grid, multifluid, 1D, hydrodynamical\nsimulations with chemistry including thermal and chemical diffusion. The\ndiffusion coefficients are enhanced to account for turbulent diffusion. We\npost-process the steady-states of our simulations with a crude model of\nradiative transfer to compute line profiles. Results. Turbulent diffusion\nspreads out the transition region between the CNM and the WNM. We find that the\nCNM slightly expands and heats up: its CH and H$_2$ content decreases due to\nthe lower density. The change of physical conditions and diffusive transport\nincrease the H$^+$ content in the CNM which results in increased OH and H$_2$O.\nDiffusion transports some CO out of the CNM. It also brings H$_2$ into contact\nwith the warm gas with enhanced production of CH$^+$, H$_3^+$, OH and H$_2$O at\nthe interface. O lines are sensitive to the spread of the thermal profile in\nthe intermediate region between the CNM and the WNM. Enhanced molecular content\nat the interface of the cloud broadens the molecular line profiles and helps\nexciting transitions of intermediate energy. The relative molecular yield are\nfound higher for bigger clouds. Conclusions. Turbulent diffusion can be the\nsource of additional molecular production and should be included in chemical\nmodels of the interstellar medium (ISM). It also is a good candidate for the\ninterpretation of observational problems such as warm H$_2$, CH$^+$ formation\nand presence of H$_3^+$.\n"}
{"text":"  We develop here a mechanism that, without making use of a cosmological\nconstant, reproduces an accelerating universe. This is done by taking into\naccount Casimir vacuum energy density, assuming that the underlying theory\nallows a maximum momentum, that turns out to be the leading contribution term\nto Einstein equations in a large expanding FRW universe. As stated in numerous\nquantum gravity studies, we postulate that maximum momentum is related to the\nexistence of the Planck length as a fundamental length. This insight, together\nwith the assumption of a Planck scale correction to the energy\/momentum\ndispersion-relation on a FRW background, is used here to calculate Casimir\nvacuum energy. We show that, under these hypothesis, an accelerated universe\nexpansion is obtained. As last step we analyze the compatibility of the\nresulting model with experimental data, writing down the equation of state for\nCasimir energy and pressure and observing that this equation of state belongs\nto a class of models that naturally fits cosmological observations. We\nemphasize that our result relies, once a fundamental length is introduced in\nCasimir effect, just on general arguments thus it is independent on an explicit\nform of the energy-momentum dispersion relation.\n"}

The resulting dissolution times of\nclusters in the solar neighborhood (SN) and in interacting galaxies are shorter\nthan predicted by two-body relaxation of clusters in a tidal field.

With a theoretical\nmodel, we follow the time evolution of gas (diffuse and condensed in clouds),\nstars, and chemical abundances in the disk of M33, assuming that the galaxy is\naccreting gas from an external reservoir. Our model is able to reproduce the\navailable observational constraints on the distribution of gas and stars in M33\nand to predict the time evolution of several chemical abundances.

An intracomparison of\naerosol concentrations is done for March 2001 using different configurations of\nthe aerosol module of one of the model used for the intercomparison. Single\nmodifications of a reference setup for model configurations are performed and\ncompared to a reference case. These modifications concern the size\ndistribution, i.e. the number of sections, and physical processes, i.e.\ncoagulation, condensation\/evaporation, cloud chemistry, heterogeneous reactions\nand sea-salt emissions. Comparing monthly averaged concentrations at different\nstations, the importance of each parameterization is first assessed. It is\nfound that sulfate concentrations are little sensitive to sea-salt emissions\nand to whether condensation is computed dynamically or by assuming\nthermodynamic equilibrium. Nitrate concentrations are little sensitive to cloud\nchemistry. However, a very high sensitivity to heterogeneous reactions is\nobserved. Thereafter, the variability of the aerosol concentrations to the use\nof different chemistry transport models (CTMs) and the variability to the use\nof different parameterizations in the aerosol module are compared. For sulfate,\nthe variability to the use of different parameterizations in the aerosol module\nis lower than the variability to the use of different CTMs. However, for\nnitrate, for monthly averaged concentrations averaged over four stations, these\ntwo variabilities have the same order of magnitude.\n"}

The\ndistributions in the color-color diagrams are fit well with single slopes to\nextinction levels of A_K ~ 7 (A_V ~ 59 mag). Consequently, there appears to be\nno significant variation of the extinction law with depth through the B59 line\nof sight.

{"text":"  Quantum gravity is analyzed from the viewpoint of the renormalization group.\nThe analysis is based on methods introduced by J. Polchinski concerning the\nperturbative renormalization with flow equations. In the first part of this\nwork, the program of renormalization with flow equations is reviewed and then\nextended to effective field theories that have a finite UV cutoff. This is done\nfor a scalar field theory by imposing additional renormalization conditions for\nsome of the nonrenormalizable couplings. It turns out that one so obtains a\nstatement on the predictivity of the effective theory at scales far below the\nUV cutoff. In particular, nonrenormalizable theories can be treated without\nproblems in the proposed framework. In the second part, the standard covariant\nBRS quantization program for Euclidean Einstein gravity is applied. A momentum\ncutoff regularization is imposed and the resulting violation of the\nSlavnov-Taylor identities is discussed. Deriving Polchinski's renormalization\ngroup equation for Euclidean quantum gravity, the predictivity of effective\nquantum gravity at scales far below the Planck scale is investigated with flow\nequations. A fine-tuning procedure for restoring the violated Slavnov-Taylor\nidentities is proposed and it is argued that in the effective quantum gravity\ncontext, the restoration will only be accomplished with finite accuracy.\nFinally, the no-cutoff limit of Euclidean quantum gravity is analyzed from the\nviewpoint of the Polchinski method.

{"text":"  We present a new numerical code, ECHO, based on an Eulerian Conservative High\nOrder scheme for time dependent three-dimensional general relativistic\nmagnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) and magnetodynamics (GRMD).

The induction equation is\ntreated by adopting the Upwind Constrained Transport (UCT) procedures,\nappropriate to preserve the divergence-free condition of the magnetic field in\nshock-capturing methods. The limiting case of magnetodynamics (also known as\nforce-free degenerate electrodynamics) is implemented by simply replacing the\nfluid velocity with the electromagnetic drift velocity and by neglecting the\nmatter contribution to the stress tensor. ECHO is particularly accurate,\nefficient, versatile, and robust. It has been tested against several\nastrophysical applications, including a novel test on the propagation of large\namplitude circularly polarized Alfven waves. In particular, we show that\nreconstruction based on a Monotonicity Preserving filter applied to a fixed\n5-point stencil gives highly accurate results for smooth solutions, both in\nflat and curved metric (up to the nominal fifth order), while at the same time\nproviding sharp profiles in tests involving discontinuities.\n"}
{"text":"  We study the Coulomb drag between two single graphene sheets in intrinsic and\nextrinsic graphene systems with no interlayer tunneling. The general expression\nfor the nonlinear susceptibility appropriate for single-layer graphene systems\nis derived using the diagrammatic perturbation theory, and the corresponding\nexact zero-temperature expression is obtained analytically. We find that,\ndespite the existence of a non-zero conductivity in an intrinsic graphene\nlayer, the Coulomb drag between intrinsic graphene layers vanishes at all\ntemperatures. In extrinsic systems, we obtain numerical results and an\napproximate analytical result for the drag resistivity $\\rho_{\\textrm{D}}$, and\nfind that $\\rho_{\\textrm{D}}$ goes as $T^2$ at low temperature $T$, as $1\/d^4$\nfor large bilayer separation $d$ and $1\/n^3$ for high carrier density $n$. We\nalso discuss qualitatively the effect of plasmon-induced enhancement on the\nCoulomb drag, which should occur at a temperature of the order of or higher\nthan the Fermi temperature.\n"}
{"text":"  Recently, the collisionless expansion of spherical nanoplasmas has been\nanalyzed with a new ergodic model, clarifying the transition from\nhydrodynamic-like to Coulomb-explosion regimes, and providing accurate laws for\nthe relevant features of the phenomenon. A complete derivation of the model is\nhere presented. The important issue of the self-consistent initial conditions\nis addressed by analyzing the initial charging transient due to the electron\nexpansion, in the approximation of immobile ions. A comparison among different\nkinetic models for the expansion is presented, showing that the ergodic model\nprovides a simplified description, which retains the essential information on\nthe electron distribution, in particular, the energy spectrum. Results are\npresented for a wide range of initial conditions (determined from a single\ndimensionless parameter), in excellent agreement with calculations from the\nexact Vlasov-Poisson theory, thus providing a complete and detailed\ncharacterization of all the stages of the expansion.\n"}
{"text":"  RNA motifs typically consist of short, modular patterns that include base\npairs formed within and between modules. Estimating the abundance of these\npatterns is of fundamental importance for assessing the statistical\nsignificance of matches in genomewide searches, and for predicting whether a\ngiven function has evolved many times in different species or arose from a\nsingle common ancestor. In this manuscript, we review in an integrated and\nself-contained manner some basic concepts of automata theory, generating\nfunctions and transfer matrix methods that are relevant to pattern analysis in\nbiological sequences. We formalize, in a general framework, the concept of\nMarkov chain embedding to analyze patterns in random strings produced by a\nmemoryless source. This conceptualization, together with the capability of\nautomata to recognize complicated patterns, allows a systematic analysis of\nproblems related to the occurrence and frequency of patterns in random strings.\nThe applications we present focus on the concept of synchronization of\nautomata, as well as automata used to search for a finite number of keywords\n(including sets of patterns generated according to base pairing rules) in a\ngeneral text.\n"}

So far, we have found a number of late O and\nearly B supergiants of different luminosities at a large range of distances.\nNothing in their optical properties sets them apart from classical Supergiant\nX-ray Binaries. On the other hand, there is now rather concluding evidence that\npersistent supergiant X-ray binaries also show fast outbursts. This suggests a\ncontinuum of behaviours between typical persistent supergiant systems and\npurely transient systems, but offers very little information about the physical\ncauses of the outbursts.\n"}

The\nprimary of HD 37366 is classified as O9.5 V, and it contributes approximately\ntwo-thirds of the optical flux. The less luminous secondary is a broad-lined,\nearly B-type main-sequence star. Tomographic reconstruction of the individual\nspectra of HD 37366 reveals absorption lines present in each component,\nenabling us to constrain the nature of the secondary and physical\ncharacteristics of both stars. Tomographic reconstruction was not possible for\nHD 54662; however, we do present mean spectra from our observations that show\nthat the secondary component is approximately half as bright as the primary.\nThe observed spectral energy distributions (SEDs) were fit with model SEDs and\ngalactic reddening curves to determine the angular sizes of the stars.

The case of covers\nof the projective line branched only over the points 0, 1, and infinity,\nthrough Belyi's theorem, leads to Grothendieck's dessins d'enfants program for\nunderstanding the absolute Galois group through its faithful action on such\ncovers. This note is motivated by Catanese's question about a\nhigher-dimensional analogue: does the absolute Galois group act faithfully on\nthe deformation equivalence classes of smooth surfaces? (These equivalence\nclasses are of course by definition the strongest deformation invariants.) We\ngive a short proof of a weaker result: the absolute Galois group acts\nfaithfully on the irreducible components of the moduli space of smooth surfaces\n(of general type, canonically polarized).

X-ray spectra from the\npn and MOS detectors confirm the high extinction reported from IR studies and\nreveal hot plasma including the first detection of the Fe K-alpha line complex\nat 6.67 keV. Spectral fits with a constant-temperature plane-parallel shock\nmodel give a shock temperature kT(shock) = 2.7 keV [T(shock) ~ 31 MK], close to\nbut slightly hotter than the maximum temperature predicted for a colliding wind\nshock. Optically thin plasma models suggest even higher temperatures, which are\nnot yet ruled out. The X-ray spectra are harder than can be accounted for using\n2D numerical colliding wind shock models based on nominal mass-loss parameters.\nPossible explanations include: (i) underestimates of the terminal wind speeds\nor wind abundances, (ii) overly simplistic colliding wind models, or (iii) the\npresence of other X-ray emission mechanisms besides colliding wind shocks.\nFurther improvement of the numerical models to include potentially important\nphysics such as non-equilibrium ionization will be needed to rigorously test\nthe colliding wind interpretation.\n"}

IRAS06468-0325 has a very unusual\nand enigmatic morphology with two components: a bright, close to point-like\nsource (the diamond) and a sharp-edge ring-like structure (the ring). The\nsource is not detected in the optical, at wavelengths shorter than the I-band.\nThe diamond is seen in all the imaging bands observed. The ring-like structure\nin IRAS06468-0325 is clearly seen in the I, J, H, and Ks. It is not detected in\nthe L'-band image. Infrared colours of the diamond are compatible with excess\ncircumstellar emission and a young stellar nature.

{"text":"  We examine the optical emission line properties of Brightest Cluster Galaxies\n(BCGs) selected from two large, homogeneous datasets. The first is the X-ray\nselected National Optical Astronomy Observatory Fundamental Plane Survey\n(NFPS), and the second is the C4 catalogue of optically selected clusters built\nfrom the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release ~3 (SDSS DR3). Our goal is to\nbetter understand the optical line emission in BCGs with respect to properties\nof the galaxy and the host cluster. Throughout the analysis we compare the line\nemission of the BCGs to that of a control sample made of the other bright\ngalaxies near the cluster centre. Overall, both the NFPS and SDSS show a modest\nfraction of BCGs with emission lines (~15%). No trend in the fraction of\nemitting BCGs as a function of galaxy mass or cluster velocity dispersion is\nfound. However we find that, for those BCGs found in cooling flow clusters,\n71^{+9}_{-14}% have optical emission. Furthermore, if we consider only BCGs\nwithin 50kpc of the X-ray centre of a cooling flow cluster, the emission-line\nfraction rises further to 100^{+0}_{-15}%. Excluding the cooling flow clusters,\nonly ~10% of BCGs are line emitting, comparable to the control sample of\ngalaxies. We show that the physical origin of the emission line activity\nvaries: in some cases it has LINER-like line ratios, whereas in others it is a\ncomposite of star-formation and LINER-like activity. We conclude that the\npresence of emission lines in BCGs is directly related to the cooling of X-ray\ngas at the cluster centre.\n"}

{"text":"  CO observations have been so far the best way to trace molecular gas in\nexternal galaxies, but at low metallicity the gas mass deduced could be largely\nunderestimated. At present, the kinematic information of CO data cubes are used\nto estimate virial masses and trace the total mass of the molecular clouds.\nMillimeter dust emission can also be used as a dense gas tracer and could\nunveil H2 envelopes lacking CO. These different tracers must be compared in\ndifferent environments. This study compares virial masses to masses deduced\nfrom millimeter emission, in two GMC samples: the local molecular clouds in our\nGalaxy and their equivalents in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), one of the\nnearest low metallicity dwarf galaxy. In our Galaxy, mass estimates deduced\nfrom millimeter emission are consistent with masses deduced from gamma ray\nanalysis and trace the total mass of the clouds. Virial masses are\nsystematically larger (twice on average) than mass estimates from millimeter\ndust emission. This difference decreases toward high masses and has already\nbeen reported in previous studies. In the SMC however, molecular cloud masses\ndeduced from SIMBA millimeter observations are systematically higher (twice on\naverage for conservative values of the dust to gas ratio and dust emissivity)\nthan the virial masses from SEST CO observations. The observed excess can not\nbe accounted for by any plausible change of dust properties. Taking a general\nform for the virial theorem, we show that a magnetic field strength of ~15\nmicro Gauss in SMC clouds could provide additional support to the clouds and\nexplain the difference observed. Masses of SMC molecular clouds have therefore\nbeen underestimated so far. Magnetic pressure may contribute significantly to\ntheir support.\n"}

{"text":"  In the peripheral nervous system, utrophin and the short dystrophin isoform\n(Dp116) are co-localized at the outermost layer of the myelin sheath of nerve\nfibers; together with the dystroglycan complex. In peripheral nerve, matrix\nmetalloproteinase (MMP) creates a 30 kDa fragment of beta-dystroglycan, leading\nto a disruption of the link between the extracellular matrix and the cell\nmembrane. Here we asked if the processing of the beta-dystroglycan could\ninfluence the anchorage of Dp116 or\/and utrophin in normal and mdx Schwann cell\nmembrane. We showed that MMP-9 was more activated in mdx nerve than in\nwild-type one. This activation leads to an accumulation of the 30 kDa\nbeta-dystroglycan isoform and have an impact on the anchorage of Dp116 and\nutrophin isoforms in mdx Schwann cells membrane.

{"text":"  We present a study of rotation (vsini) and chromospheric activity (Halpha EW)\nbased on an extensive set of high-resolution optical spectra obtained with MIKE\non the 6.5m Magellan Clay telescope. Our targets are 74 F-M dwarfs in the young\nstellar associations Eta Cha, TW Hydrae, Beta Pic, and Tuc-Hor, spanning ages\nfrom 6 to 30 Myr. While the Halpha EW for most F and G stars are consistent\nwith pure photospheric absorption, most K and M stars show chromospheric\nemission. By comparing Halpha EW in our sample to results in the literature, we\nsee a clear evolutionary sequence: Chromospheric activity declines steadily\nfrom the T Tauri phase to the main sequence. Using activity as an age\nindicator, we find a plausible age range for the Tuc-Hor association of 10-40\nMyr. Between 5 and 30 Myr, we do not see evidence for rotational braking in the\ntotal sample, thus angular momentum is conserved, in contrast to younger stars.\nThis difference indicates a change in the rotational regulation at 5-10 Myr,\npossibly because disk braking cannot operate longer than typical disk\nlifetimes, allowing the objects to spin up. The rotation-activity relation is\nflat in our sample; in contrast to main-sequence stars, there is no linear\ncorrelation for slow rotators. We argue that this is because young stars\ngenerate their magnetic fields in a fundamentally different way from\nmain-sequence stars, and not just the result of a saturated solar-type dynamo.\nBy comparing our rotational velocities with published rotation periods for a\nsubset of stars, we determine ages of 13 (7-20) Myr and 9 (7-17} Myr for the\nEta Cha and TWA associations, respectively, consistent with previous estimates.\nThus we conclude that stellar radii from evolutionary models by Baraffe et al.\n(1998) are in agreement with the observed radii within +-15%.

{"text":"  In several classes of particle physics models -- ranging from the classical\nMajoron models, to the more recent scenarios of late neutrino masses or\nMass-Varying Neutrinos -- one or more of the neutrinos are postulated to couple\nto a new light scalar field.

Other patches\nof diffuse emission, not previously explored at these high latitudes on\narcminute scales, probably contain Galactic ``cirrus''.

Residual correlations between photons from pion decays\nare considered as a new possible source of information on direct photon\nfraction. Residual correlations in $p\\gamma$ and $p\\Lambda$ systems due to\n$p\\Sigma^0$ interaction in final state are predicted based on the $p\\Sigma^0$\nlow energy scattering parameters deduced from the spin-flavour SU$_6$ model by\nFujiwara et al. including effective meson exchange potentials and explicit\nflavour symmetry breaking to reproduce the properties of the two-nucleon system\nand the low-energy hyperon-nucleon cross section data. The $p\\gamma_{\\Sigma^0}$\nresidual correlation is concentrated at $k^* \\approx 70$ Mev\/$c$ and its shape\nand intensity appears to be sensitive to the scattering parameters and\nspace-time dimensions of the source. The $p\\Lambda_{\\Sigma^0}$ residual\ncorrelation recovers the negative parent $p\\Sigma^0$ correlation for $k^* > 70$\nMev\/$c$. The neglect of this negative residual correlation would lead to the\nunderestimation of the parent $p\\Lambda$ correlation effect and to an\noverestimation of the source size.\n"}
{"text":"  In wireless packet-forwarding networks with selfish nodes, applications of a\nrepeated game can induce the nodes to forward each others' packets, so that the\nnetwork performance can be improved. However, the nodes on the boundary of such\nnetworks cannot benefit from this strategy, as the other nodes do not depend on\nthem. This problem is sometimes known as the curse of the boundary nodes. To\novercome this problem, an approach based on coalition games is proposed, in\nwhich the boundary nodes can use cooperative transmission to help the backbone\nnodes in the middle of the network. In return, the backbone nodes are willing\nto forward the boundary nodes' packets. The stability of the coalitions is\nstudied using the concept of a core. Then two types of fairness, namely, the\nmin-max fairness using nucleolus and the average fairness using the Shapley\nfunction are investigated. Finally, a protocol is designed using both repeated\ngames and coalition games. Simulation results show how boundary nodes and\nbackbone nodes form coalitions together according to different fairness\ncriteria. The proposed protocol can improve the network connectivity by about\n50%, compared with pure repeated game schemes.\n"}

Although the action of the theory is manifestly Lorentz-invariant the\nnon-trivial solutions break this symmetry spontaneously, allowing, the\nsuperluminal propagation of perturbations with respect to this \"new ether\". We\nfound the stationary solution for background, which describes the accretion of\nthe scalar field onto a black hole. Examining the propagation of small\nperturbations around this solution we show that the signals emitted inside the\nSchwarzschild horizon can reach an observer located outside the black hole.\nThus the accreting field forms a hydrodynamical analog of a black hole whose\nhorizon is inside of the gravitational black hole drawing in the scalar field.\n"}

{"text":"  How can a microorganism adapt to a variety of environmental conditions\ndespite there exists a limited number of signal transduction machineries? We\nshow that for any growing cells whose gene expression is under stochastic\nfluctuations, adaptive cellular state is inevitably selected by noise, even\nwithout specific signal transduction network for it. In general, changes in\nprotein concentration in a cell are given by its synthesis minus dilution and\ndegradation, both of which are proportional to the rate of cell growth. In an\nadaptive state with a higher growth speed, both terms are large and balanced.\nUnder the presence of noise in gene expression, the adaptive state is less\naffected by stochasticity since both the synthesis and dilution terms are\nlarge, while for a non-adaptive state both the terms are smaller so that cells\nare easily kicked out of the original state by noise. Hence, escape time from a\ncellular state and the cellular growth rate are negatively correlated. This\nleads to a selection of adaptive states with higher growth rates, and model\nsimulations confirm this selection to take place in general. The results\nsuggest a general form of adaptation that has never been brought to light - a\nprocess that requires no specific machineries for sensory adaptation. The\npresent scheme may help explain a wide range of cellular adaptive responses\nincluding the metabolic flux optimization for maximal cell growth.\n"}

The simulations were performed within the\nflat-Lambda, open and flat matter only CDM cosmogonies. Two unconstrained\nsimulations of the flat-Lambda and open CDM models were performed for\ncomparison. LG-like objects have been selected so as to mimic the real LG\nenvironment.

{"text":"  We model energy dependencies of the quasi periodic oscillations (QPO) in the\nmodel of disc epicyclic motions, with X-ray modulation caused by varying\nrelativistic effects. The model was proposed to explain the high frequency QPO\nobserved in X-ray binaries. We consider two specific scenarios for the geometry\nof accretion flow and spectral formation. Firstly, a standard cold accretion\ndisc with an active X-ray emitting corona is assumed to oscillate. Secondly,\nonly a hot X-ray emitting accretion flow oscillates, while the cold disc is\nabsent at the QPO radius. We find that the QPO spectra are generally similar to\nthe spectrum of radiation emitted at the QPO radius, and they are broadened by\nthe relativistic effects. In particular, the QPO spectrum contains the disc\ncomponent in the oscillating disc with a corona scenario. We also review the\navailable data on energy dependencies of high frequency QPO, and we point out\nthat they appear to lack the disc component in their energy spectra. This would\nsuggest the hot flow geometry in the spectral states when high frequency QPO\nare observed.\n"}
{"text":"  Extending network lifetime of battery-operated devices is a key design issue\nthat allows uninterrupted information exchange among distributive nodes in\nwireless sensor networks. Collaborative beamforming (CB) and cooperative\ntransmission (CT) have recently emerged as new communication techniques that\nenable and leverage effective resource sharing among collaborative\/cooperative\nnodes. In this paper, we seek to maximize the lifetime of sensor networks by\nusing the new idea that closely located nodes can use CB\/CT to reduce the load\nor even avoid packet forwarding requests to nodes that have critical battery\nlife. First, we study the effectiveness of CB\/CT to improve the signal strength\nat a faraway destination using energy in nearby nodes. Then, a 2D disk case is\nanalyzed to assess the resulting performance improvement. For general networks,\nif information-generation rates are fixed, the new routing problem is\nformulated as a linear programming problem; otherwise, the cost for routing is\ndynamically adjusted according to the amount of energy remaining and the\neffectiveness of CB\/CT. From the analysis and simulation results, it is seen\nthat the proposed schemes can improve the lifetime by about 90% in the 2D disk\nnetwork and by about 10% in the general networks, compared to existing schemes.\n"}

{"text":"  Cooperative transmission is an emerging communication technique that takes\nadvantages of the broadcast nature of wireless channels. However, due to low\nspectral efficiency and the requirement of orthogonal channels, its potential\nfor use in future wireless networks is limited.

Compared with the traditional cooperative transmission protocols\nwith single-user detection, in which the diversity gain is only for one source\nuser, the proposed MUD cooperative transmission protocols have the merits that\nthe improvement of one user's link can also benefit the other users. In\naddition, using MUD at the relay provides an environment in which network\ncoding can be employed.

We use the difference in high-scale gauge couplings to estimate the\nmagnitude of this perturbation and study the potential effects of the magnetic\nfluxes by generating many random spectra with the soft terms perturbed around\nthe dilute flux limit. Even with a 40% variation in the high-scale soft terms\nthe low-energy spectra take a clear and predictive form. The resulting spectra\nare broadly similar to those arising on the SPS1a slope, but more degenerate.\nIn their minimal version the models predict the ratios of gaugino masses to be\nM_1 : M_2 : M_3=(1.5 - 2) : 2 : 6, different to both mSUGRA and mirage\nmediation.

{"text":"  In this paper we address the problem of finding the sensing capacity of\nsensor networks for a class of linear observation models and a fixed SNR\nregime. Sensing capacity is defined as the maximum number of signal dimensions\nreliably identified per sensor observation. In this context sparsity of the\nphenomena is a key feature that determines sensing capacity. Precluding the SNR\nof the environment the effect of sparsity on the number of measurements\nrequired for accurate reconstruction of a sparse phenomena has been widely\ndealt with under compressed sensing. Nevertheless the development there was\nmotivated from an algorithmic perspective. In this paper our aim is to derive\nthese bounds in an information theoretic set-up and thus provide algorithm\nindependent conditions for reliable reconstruction of sparse signals. In this\ndirection we first generalize the Fano's inequality and provide lower bounds to\nthe probability of error in reconstruction subject to an arbitrary distortion\ncriteria. Using these lower bounds to the probability of error, we derive upper\nbounds to sensing capacity and show that for fixed SNR regime sensing capacity\ngoes down to zero as sparsity goes down to zero. This means that\ndisproportionately more sensors are required to monitor very sparse events. Our\nnext main contribution is that we show the effect of sensing diversity on\nsensing capacity, an effect that has not been considered before. Sensing\ndiversity is related to the effective \\emph{coverage} of a sensor with respect\nto the field. In this direction we show the following results (a) Sensing\ncapacity goes down as sensing diversity per sensor goes down; (b) Random\nsampling (coverage) of the field by sensors is better than contiguous location\nsampling (coverage).\n"}

The fuzzy ARTMAP is found to be comparable to many of the widespread\nmachine learning systems. The use of an evolutionary strategy in the selection\nand combination of individual classifiers into an ensemble system, coupled with\nthe incremental learning ability of the fuzzy ARTMAP is proven to be suitable\nas a pattern classifier. The algorithm presented is tested using data from the\nG-Coupled Protein Receptors Database and shows good accuracy of 83%. The system\npresented is also generally applicable, and can be used in problems in genomics\nand proteomics.\n"}
{"text":"  We present a study of the distribution of AGN in clusters of galaxies with a\nuniformly selected, spectroscopically complete sample of 35 AGN in eight\nclusters at z = 0.06 to 0.31. We find that the 12 AGN with L_X > 10^42 erg\/s in\ngalaxies more luminous than a rest-frame M_R < -20 mag are more centrally\nconcentrated than typical cluster galaxies of this luminosity, although these\nAGN have comparable velocity and substructure distributions to other cluster\nmembers. In contrast, a larger sample of 30 cluster AGN with L_X > 10^41 erg\/s\ndo not show evidence for greater concentration than inactive members, nor\nevidence for a different kinematic or substructure distribution. As we do see\nclear differences in the spatial and kinematic distributions of the blue\nButcher-Oemler and red galaxy populations, any difference in the AGN and\ninactive galaxy population must be less distinct than that between these two\npairs of populations. Comparison of the AGN fraction selected via X-ray\nemission in this study to similarly-selected AGN in the field indicates that\nthe AGN fraction is not significantly lower in clusters, contrary to AGN\nidentified via visible-wavelength emission lines, but similar to the\napproximately constant radio-selected AGN fraction in clusters and the field.\nWe also find significant evidence for variation between clusters and explore\nthe dependence of cluster AGN fraction on redshift, velocity dispersion,\ncluster substructure, and Butcher-Oemler fraction. While we see weak evidence\nfor several trends, correlations between these four parameters in our small\nsample precludes identification of which one(s) most strongly influence the\ncluster AGN fraction.\n"}
{"text":"  An operator theoretic approach to orthogonal rational functions on the unit\ncircle with poles in its exterior is presented in this paper. This approach is\nbased on the identification of a suitable matrix representation of the\nmultiplication operator associated with the corresponding orthogonality\nmeasure. Two different alternatives are discussed, depending whether we use for\nthe matrix representation the standard basis of orthogonal rational functions,\nor a new one with poles alternatively located in the exterior and the interior\nof the unit circle. The corresponding representations are linear fractional\ntransformations with matrix coefficients acting respectively on Hessenberg and\nfive-diagonal unitary matrices.\n  In consequence, the orthogonality measure can be recovered from the spectral\nmeasure of an infinite unitary matrix depending uniquely on the poles and the\nparameters of the recurrence relation for the orthogonal rational functions.\nBesides, the zeros of the orthogonal and para-orthogonal rational functions are\nidentified as the eigenvalues of matrix linear fractional transformations of\nfinite Hessenberg and five-diagonal matrices.\n  As an application of this operator approach, we obtain new relations between\nthe support of the orthogonality measure and the location of the poles and\nparameters of the recurrence relation, generalizing to the rational case known\nresults for orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle.\n  Finally, we extend these results to orthogonal polynomials on the real line\nwith poles in the lower half plane.\n"}

{"text":"  We report the discovery of one of the most powerful sunquakes detected to\ndate, produced by an X1.2-class solar flare in active region 10720 on 2005\nJanuary 15. We used helioseismic holography to image the source of seismic\nwaves emitted into the solar interior from the site of the flare. Acoustic\negression power maps at 3 and 6 mHz with a 2 mHz bandpass reveal a compact\nacoustic source strongly correlated with impulsive hard X-ray and\nvisible-continuum emission along the penumbral neutral line separating the two\nmajor opposing umbrae in the $\\delta$-configuration sunspot that predominates\nAR10720. The acoustic emission signatures were directly aligned with both hard\nX-ray and visible continuum emission that emanated during the flare. The\nvisible continuum emission is estimated at $2.0 \\times 10^{23}$ J,\napproximately 500 times the seismic emission of $\\sim 4 \\times 10^{20}$ J. The\nflare of 2005 January 15 exhibits the same close spatial alignment between the\nsources of the seismic emission and impulsive visible continuum emission as\nprevious flares, reinforcing the hypothesis that the acoustic emission may be\ndriven by heating of the low photosphere. However, it is a major exception in\nthat there was no signature to indicate the inclusion of protons in the\nparticle beams thought to supply the energy radiated by the flare. The\ncontinued strong coincidence between the sources of seismic emission and\nimpulsive visible continuum emission in the case of a proton-deficient\nwhite-light flare lends substantial support to the ``back -- warming''\nhypothesis, that the low photosphere is significantly heated by intense Balmer\nand Paschen continuum-edge radiation from the overlying chromosphere in\nwhite-light flares.\n"}

The approximate value of the exponent at the\nextremum on parametric resonance regions was obtained theoretically by\nintroducing the width of time interval, and the exponents were calculated\nnumerically by solving the stochastic differential equations by a symplectic\nnumerical method. The Mathieu-like equation contains a parameter $\\alpha$ that\nis determined by the intensity of noise and the strength of the coupling\nbetween the variable and the noise. The value of $\\alpha$ was restricted not to\nbe negative without loss of generality. It was shown that the exponent\ndecreases with $\\alpha$, reaches a minimum and increases after that. It was\nalso found that the exponent as a function of $\\alpha$ has only one minimum at\n$\\alpha \\neq 0$ on parametric resonance regions of $\\alpha = 0$. This minimum\nvalue is obtained theoretically and numerically. The existence of the minimum\nat $\\alpha \\neq 0$ indicates the suppression of the growth by multiplicative\nwhite noise.\n"}
{"text":"  We present metallicities and their variations with different parameters for\n36 high-latitude fields covering Galactic longitudes 0<l<360. The metallicities\nfor relatively short vertical distances (z<2.5 kpc) show systematic\nfluctuations with Galactic longitude, similar to those of the thick-disc\nscaleheight, which may be interpreted as indicating a common origin, viz., the\nflare effect of the disc. This suggestion is supported by the metallicity\nvariations which we find as functions of radial distance. The metallicity\nvariation at larger vertical distances (6.5<z<9.5 kpc) is small but monotonic.\nThree different vertical metallicity gradients could be detected:\nd[M\/H]\/dz=-0.22(+\/-0.03), d[M\/H]\/dz=-0.38 (+\/-0.06), and d[M\/H]\/dz=-0.08\n(+\/-0.07) dex\/kpc for the intervals z<3, 3<z<5, and 5<z<10 kpc, respectively.\nSince our data cover the whole Galactic longitude interval, the resulting\nmetallicity gradients can be interpreted as properties of the larger-scale\nGalaxy. The first gradient confirms the dissipational formation of the disc at\nshort z-distances. The steeper gradient corresponds to the transition region\nbetween different population components of the Galaxy, and finally, the lowest\nvalue provides an adequate description of the inner-halo metallicity gradient.\n"}
{"text":"  X-ray transients appeared in optically non-active galactic nuclei have been\nobserved in recent years. The most popular model explaining this kind of\nphenomena is the conventional tidal disruption model. In this model, when a\nstar moves within the tidal radius of a black hole, part of the star materials\nwill fall into the black hole through an accretion disk, which gives rise to\nthe luminous flare. We propose that the X-ray emission may not necessarily come\nfrom radiation of the accretion disk alone. Instead, it may be related to a\njet. As the jet travels in the interstellar medium, a shock is produced and\nsynchrotron radiation is expected. We compared the model light curve and the\nsynchrotron radiation spectrum with the observed data, and find that our model\nexplains the observed light curve and late-time spectrum well.

{"text":"  The overlap Dirac operator in lattice QCD requires the computation of the\nsign function of a matrix. While this matrix is usually Hermitian, it becomes\nnon-Hermitian in the presence of a quark chemical potential. We show how the\naction of the sign function of a non-Hermitian matrix on an arbitrary vector\ncan be computed efficiently on large lattices by an iterative method. A Krylov\nsubspace approximation based on the Arnoldi algorithm is described for the\nevaluation of a generic matrix function. The efficiency of the method is\nspoiled when the matrix has eigenvalues close to a function discontinuity. This\nis cured by adding a small number of critical eigenvectors to the Krylov\nsubspace, for which we propose two different deflation schemes. The ensuing\nmodified Arnoldi method is then applied to the sign function, which has a\ndiscontinuity along the imaginary axis. The numerical results clearly show the\nimproved efficiency of the method. Our modification is particularly effective\nwhen the action of the sign function of the same matrix has to be computed many\ntimes on different vectors, e.g., if the overlap Dirac operator is inverted\nusing an iterative method.\n"}
{"text":"  One proposed method for finding terrestrial planets around nearby stars is to\nuse two spacecraft--a telescope and a specially shaped occulter that is\nspecifically designed to prevent all but a tiny fraction of the starlight from\ndiffracting into the telescope. As the cost and observing cadence for such a\nmission will be driven largely by the separation between the two spacecraft, it\nis critically important to design an occulter that can meet the observing goals\nwhile flying as close to the telescope as possible. In this paper, we explore\nthis tradeoff between separation and occulter diameter. More specifically, we\npresent a method for designing the shape of the outer edge of an occulter that\nis as small as possible and gives a shadow that is deep enough and large enough\nfor a 4m telescope to survey the habitable zones of many stars for Earth-like\nplanets.

{"text":"  In this paper we derive new expected scaling relations for clusters with\ngiant radio halos in the framework of the re-acceleration scenario in a\nsimplified, but physically motivated, form, namely: radio power (P_R) vs size\nof the radio emitting region (R_H), and P_R vs total cluster mass (M_H)\ncontained in the emitting region and cluster velocity dispersion (sigma_H) in\nthis region.\n  We search for these correlations by analyzing the most recent radio and X-ray\ndata available in the literature for a well known sample of clusters with giant\nradio halos. In particular we find a good correlation between P_R and R_H and a\nvery tight ``geometrical'' scaling between M_H and R_H. From these correlations\nP_R is also expected to scale with M_H and sigma_H and this is confirmed by our\nanalysis. We show that all the observed trends can be well reconciled with\nexpectations in the case of a slight variation of the mean magnetic field\nstrength in the radio halo volume with M_H. A byproduct correlation between R_H\nand sigma_H is also found, and can be further tested by optical studies. In\naddition, we find that observationally R_H scales non-linearly with the virial\nradius of the host cluster, and this immediately means that the fraction of the\ncluster volume which is radio emitting increases with cluster mass and thus\nthat the non-thermal component in clusters is not self-similar.\n"}
{"text":"  We report the serendipitous findings of 13 faint meteors and 44 artificial\nspace objects by Subaru SuprimeCam imaging observations during 11-16 August\n2004. The meteors, at about 100km altitude, and artificial satellites\/debris in\norbit, at 500km altitude or higher, were clearly discriminated by their\napparent defocused image sizes. CCD photometry of the 13 meteors, including 1\nPerseid, 1 Aquarid, and 11 sporadic meteors, was performed. We defined a peak\nvideo-rate magnitude by comparing the integrated photon counts from the\nbrightest portion of the track traversed within 33ms to those from a 0-mag star\nduring the same time duration. This definition gives magnitudes in the range\n4.0< V_{vr} <6.4 and 4.1< I_{vr}<5.9 for these 13 meteors. The corresponding\nmagnitude for virtual naked-eye observers could be somewhat fainter especially\nfor the V-band observation, in which the [OI] 5577 line lasting about 1 sec as\nan afterglow could contribute to the integrated flux of the present 5-10 min\nCCD exposures. Although the spatial resolution is insufficient to resolve the\nsource size of anything smaller than about 1 m, we developed a new estimate of\nthe collisionally excited column diameter of these meteors. A diameter as small\nas a few mm was derived from their collisionally excited photon rates, meteor\nspeed, and the volume density of the oxygen atoms at the 100km altitude. The\nactual column diameter of the radiating zone, however, could be as large as few\n100m because the excited atoms travel that distance before they emit forbidden\nlines in 0.7 sec of its average lifetime.

{"text":"  Unsustained matter distributions unescapely collapse unless fragmentation and\ncentrifugal or pressure support take place. Starting from the above evidence,\nsupermassive compact objects at the centre of large-mass galaxies are conceived\nas the end-product of the gravitational collapse of local density maxima around\nwhich overdensities are located. At the beginning of evolution, local density\nmaxima are idealized as homogeneous peaks, while the surrounding envelopes are\ndescribed by a power-law density profile. The dependence of the density profile\non a second parameter, chosen to be the ratio between peak and total mass, is\nanalysed. Overdensity evolution is discussed in the context of quintessence\ncosmological models and further investigation is devoted to a special case with\nthe aim to describe the central collapse. An empirical relation between hole\nand dark halo mass is translated into a dependence of the fractional hole mass\non the overdensity mass. Computations are performed up to the end of central\ncollapse, and density profiles of related configurations are determined\ntogether with additional parameters. The central collapse is completed in early\ntimes, no longer than a few hundredths of Gyr, which implies hole formation\nwhen proto-haloes, proto-bulges, and proto-disks are still expanding or\ncontracting. No appreciable change in evolution is found with regard to\ndifferent mean peak heights related to equal masses. On the other hand, it is\nrecognized that homogeneous peaks collapse ``faster'' with respect to\nsurroundings envelopes, in low-mass than in large-mass overdensities. In\nconclusion, it is inferred that gravitational collapse of homogeneous peaks\nwithin overdensities may be a viable mechanism for hole generation.\n"}
{"text":"  As ASTROD I travels through space, its test mass will accrue charge due to\ngalactic cosmic-rays and solar energetic particles incident on the spacecraft.\nThis test mass charge will result in Coulomb forces between the test mass and\nthe surrounding electrodes.

The QE state parameter qI,,\nthe relative recombination probability g, and a new parameter called\nquasi-stationary (QS) state parameter q*=qIg are used for the analysis of the\nTSL and TSC. The TSL and TSC curves and the temperature dependences of qI, q*,\ng, the recombination lifetime, and the occupancies of active traps and\nrecombination centers are numerically calculated for five sets of kinetic\nparameters and different heating rates.

{"text":"  In object-oriented or object-relational databases such as multimedia\ndatabases or most XML databases, access patterns are not static, i.e.,\napplications do not always access the same objects in the same order\nrepeatedly. However, this has been the way these databases and associated\noptimisation techniques such as clustering have been evaluated up to now. This\npaper opens up research regarding this issue by proposing a dynamic object\nevaluation framework (DOEF). DOEF accomplishes access pattern change by\ndefining configurable styles of change. It is a preliminary prototype that has\nbeen designed to be open and fully extensible. Though originally designed for\nthe object-oriented model, it can also be used within the object-relational\nmodel with few adaptations. Furthermore, new access pattern change models can\nbe added too. To illustrate the capabilities of DOEF, we conducted two\ndifferent sets of experiments. In the first set of experiments, we used DOEF to\ncompare the performances of four state of the art dynamic clustering\nalgorithms. The results show that DOEF is effective at determining the\nadaptability of each dynamic clustering algorithm to changes in access pattern.\nThey also led us to conclude that dynamic clustering algorithms can cope with\nmoderate levels of access pattern change, but that performance rapidly degrades\nto be worse than no clustering when vigorous styles of access pattern change\nare applied.

{"text":"  Young open clusters are likely sites of cosmic ray acceleration as indicated\nby recent detections of the TeV gamma-ray sources in the directions of two open\nclusters (Cyg OB2 and Westerlund 2) and their directional proximity to some\nunidentified EGRET sources.

Here we consider in detail the radiation processes\ndue to both electrons and hadrons accelerated inside the open cluster. As a\nspecific scenario, we apply the acceleration process at the shocks arising in\nthe winds of WR type stars.

{"text":"  The effect of Li substitution for Mg and of Li-C co-substitution on the\nsuperconducting properties and crystal structure of MgB2 single crystals has\nbeen investigated. It has been found that hole doping with Li decreases the\nsuperconducting transition temperature Tc, but at a slower rate than electron\ndoping with C or Al. Tc of MgB2 crystals with simultaneously substituted Li for\nMg and C for B decreases more than in the case where C is substituted alone.\nThis means that holes introduced by Li cannot counterbalance the effect of\ndecrease of Tc caused by introduction of electrons coming from C. The possible\nreason of it can be that holes coming from Li occupy the pi band while\nelectrons coming from C fill the sigma band. The temperature dependences of the\nupper critical field Hc2 for Al and Li substituted crystals with the same Tc\nshow a similar dHc2\/dT slope at Tc and a similar Hc2(T) behavior, despite of\nmuch different substitution level. This indicates that the mechanism\ncontrolling Hc2 and Tc is similar in both hole and electron doped crystals.\nElectrical transport measurements show an increase of resistivity both in Li\nsubstituted crystals and in Li and C co-substituted crystals. This indicates\nenhanced scattering due to defects introduced by substitutions including\ndistortion of the lattice. The observed behavior can be explained as a result\nof two effects, influencing both Tc and Hc2. The first one is doping related to\nthe changes in the carrier concentration, which may lead to the decrease or to\nthe increase of Tc.

In the first\ncase the $2 \\to 2$ contributions associated with soft radiations summed up in\nthe $k_t$-factorization approach dominate at $\\phi \\sim \\pi$ and at equal\nmoduli of jet transverse momenta. The collinear NLO $2 \\to 3$ contributions\ndominate over $k_t$-factorization cross section at small relative azimuthal\nangles as well as for asymmetric transverse momentum configurations. In the\nsecond case the NLO contributions vanish at small relative azimuthal angles\nand\/or large jet transverse-momentum disbalance due to simple kinematical\nconstraints. There are no such limitations for the $k_t$-factorization\napproach. All this makes the two approaches rather complementary. The role of\nseveral cuts is discussed and quantified.\n"}
{"text":"  This pedagogical review aims at presenting the fundamental aspects of the\ntheory of inflationary cosmological perturbations of quantum-mechanical origin.\nThe analogy with the well-known Schwinger effect is discussed in detail and a\nsystematic comparison of the two physical phenomena is carried out. In\nparticular, it is demonstrated that the two underlying formalisms differ only\nup to an irrelevant canonical transformation. Hence, the basic physical\nmechanisms at play are similar in both cases and can be reduced to the\nquantization of a parametric oscillator leading to particle creation due to the\ninteraction with a classical source: pair production in vacuum is therefore\nequivalent to the appearance of a growing mode for the cosmological\nfluctuations. The only difference lies in the nature of the source: an electric\nfield in the case of the Schwinger effect and the gravitational field in the\ncase of inflationary perturbations. Although, in the laboratory, it is\nnotoriously difficult to produce an electric field such that pairs extracted\nfrom the vacuum can be detected, the gravitational field in the early universe\ncan be strong enough to lead to observable effects that ultimately reveal\nthemselves as temperature fluctuations in the Cosmic Microwave Background.\nFinally, the question of how quantum cosmological perturbations can be\nconsidered as classical is discussed at the end of the article.\n"}
{"text":"  We differentiate between the metal enrichment of the gas in virialized\nminihalos and that of the intergalactic medium at high redshift, pertinent to\ncosmological reionization, with the initial expectation that gas in the high\ndensity regions within formed dark matter halos may be more robust thus\nresistant to mixing with lower density intergalactic medium. Using detailed\nhydrodynamic simulations of gas clouds in minihalos subject to destructive\nprocesses associated with the encompassing intergalactic shocks carrying\nmetal-enriched gas, we find, as an example, that, for realistic shocks of\nvelocities of 10-100km\/s, more than (90%,65%) of the high density gas with\nrho>500 rhob inside a minihalo virialized at z=10 of mass (10^7,10^6)Msun\nremains at a metallicity lower than 3% of that of the intergalactic medium by\nredshift z=6. It may be expected that the high density gas in minihalos becomes\nfuel for subsequent star formation, when they are incorporated into larger\nhalos where efficient atomic cooling can induce gas condensation hence star\nformation. Since minihalos virialize at high redshift when the universe is not\nexpected to have been significantly reionized, the implication is that gas in\nvirialized minihalos may provide an abundant reservoir of primordial gas to\npossibly allow for the formation of Population-III metal-free stars to extend\nto much lower redshift than otherwise expected based on the enrichment of\nintergalactic medium.\n"}
{"text":"  The blasting of brittle materials with sharp particles is an important\nfabrication technology in many industrial processes. In particular, for\nmicro-systems, it allows the production of devices with feature sizes down to\nfew tens of microns. An important parameter of this process is the surface\nroughness of post-blasted surfaces. In this work the scaling properties of\nPyrex glass and silicon surfaces after bombardment with alumina particles is\ninvestigated. The targets were bombarded at normal incidence using alumina\nparticles with two different average sizes, $29\\mu m$ and $9\\mu m$,\nrespectively. This investigation indicates that the resulting surfaces have\nmultifractal properties. Applying multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis\n(MFDFA) allowed us to determine the singularity spectrum of the surfaces. This\nspectrum did not depend on the target material or on the size of the particles.\nSeveral parameters quantifying relevant quantities were determined. We argue\nthat for scales below $5 \\mu m$, fracture processes are dominant while at large\nscales long range correlations are responsible for the multifractal behaviour.\n"}
{"text":"  In this paper a lattice model for diffusional transport of particles in the\ninterphase cell nucleus is proposed. Dense networks of chromatin fibers are\ncreated by three different methods: randomly distributed, non-interconnected\nobstacles, a random walk chain model, and a self avoiding random walk chain\nmodel with persistence length. By comparing a discrete and a continuous version\nof the random walk chain model, we demonstrate that lattice discretization does\nnot alter particle diffusion. The influence of the 3D geometry of the fiber\nnetwork on the particle diffusion is investigated in detail, while varying\noccupation volume, chain length, persistence length and walker size. It is\nshown that adjacency of the monomers, the excluded volume effect incorporated\nin the self avoiding random walk model, and, to a lesser extent, the\npersistence length, affect particle diffusion. It is demonstrated how the\nintroduction of the effective chain occupancy, which is a convolution of the\ngeometric chain volume with the walker size, eliminates the conformational\neffects of the network on the diffusion, i.e., when plotting the diffusion\ncoefficient as a function of the effective chain volume, the data fall onto a\nmaster curve.\n"}
{"text":"  The maximum number density of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs), as deduced from\nX-ray studies, occurs at z<~1, with lower luminosity objects peaking at smaller\nredshifts.

{"text":"  The dominant background for observations of gamma-rays in the energy region\nabove 50 GeV with Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes are cosmic-ray\nevents. The images of most of the cosmic ray showers look significantly\ndifferent from those of gamma-rays and are therefore easily discriminated.\nHowever, a small fraction of events seems to be indistinguishable from\ngamma-rays. This constitutes an irreducible background to the observation of\nhigh-energy gamma-ray sources, and limits the sensitivity achievable with a\ngiven instrument. Here, a Monte Carlo study of gamma-like cosmic-ray events is\npresented. The nature of gamma-like cosmic-ray events, the shower particles\nthat are responsible for the gamma-like appearance, and the dependence of these\nresults on the choice of the hadronic interaction model are investigated.

Inspired by flux-background\nsolutions of type IIB supergravity, a metric background that deviates from\nAdS_5 in the IR breaks supersymmetry, while the fermion mass hierarchy results\nfrom the wavefunction overlap of bulk fermions with a UV-confined Higgs field.\nThe first and second generation squarks and sleptons, which are localized near\nthe IR brane, directly feel the supersymmetry breaking and obtain masses of\norder 10 TeV. These are interpreted as composite states of the dual 4D theory.\nThe gauginos and third generation squarks and sleptons are elementary states\nthat obtain soft masses of order 1 TeV at the loop level via direct gauge\nmediation. This particle spectrum leads to distinctive signatures at the LHC,\nsimilar to the usual gauge mediation with a neutralino NLSP that decays\npromptly to a gravitino LSP, but with lower event rates.

{"text":"  A large sample of pulsars has been observed to study their subpulse\nmodulation at an observing wavelength (when achievable) of both 21 and 92 cm\nusing the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope. In this paper we present the\n92-cm data and a comparison is made with the already published 21-cm results.\nWe analysed 191 pulsars at 92 cm using fluctuation spectra. The sample of\npulsars is as unbiased as possible towards any particular pulsar\ncharacteristics. For 15 pulsars drifting subpulses are discovered for the first\ntime and 26 of the new drifters found in the 21-cm data are confirmed. We\ndiscovered nulling for 8 sources and 8 pulsars are found to intermittently emit\nsingle pulses that have pulse energies similar to giant pulses. It is estimated\nthat at least half of the total population of pulsars have drifting subpulses\nwhen observations with a high enough signal-to-noise ratio would be available.\nIt could well be that the drifting subpulse mechanism is an intrinsic property\nof the emission mechanism itself, although for some pulsars it is difficult or\nimpossible to detect. Drifting subpulses are in general found at both\nfrequencies, although the chance of detecting drifting subpulses is possibly\nslightly higher at 92 cm. It appears that the youngest pulsars have the most\ndisordered subpulses and the subpulses become more and more organized into\ndrifting subpulses as the pulsar ages. The correlations with the modulation\nindices are argued to be consistent with the picture in which the radio\nemission can be divided in a drifting subpulse signal plus a quasi-steady\nsignal which becomes, on average, stronger at high observing frequencies. The\nmeasured values of P3 at the two frequencies are highly correlated, but there\nis no evidence for a correlation with other pulsar parameters.\n"}

Significant structural and evolutionary differences\noccur between simulations with and without heat conduction. Dense clouds in\npure dynamical models experience dynamical destruction by Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH)\ninstability. In static models heat conduction leads to evaporation of such\nclouds.

We obtain dust-corrected SFRs by fitting the GALEX (UV) and SDSS\n(optical) photometry to a library of population synthesis models that include\ndust attenuation. For star-forming galaxies, our UV-based SFRs compare\nremarkably well with those derived from SDSS H alpha. Deviations from perfect\nagreement between these two methods are due to differences in the dust\nattenuation estimates. In contrast to H alpha, UV provides reliable SFRs for\ngalaxies with weak or no H alpha emission, and where H alpha is contaminated\nwith an emission from an AGN. We use full-SED SFRs to calibrate a simple\nprescription that uses GALEX UV magnitudes to produce good SFRs for normal\nstar-forming galaxies. The specific SFR is considered as a function of stellar\nmass for (1) star-forming galaxies with no AGN, (2) those hosting an AGN, and\nfor (3) galaxies without H alpha emission. We find that the three have distinct\nstar formation histories, with AGN lying intermediate between the star-forming\nand the quiescent galaxies. Normal star forming galaxies (without an AGN) lie\non a relatively narrow linear sequence. Remarkably, galaxies hosting a strong\nAGN appear to represent the massive continuation of this sequence. Weak AGN,\nwhile also massive, have lower SFR, sometimes extending to the realm of\nquiescent galaxies. We propose an evolutionary sequence for massive galaxies\nthat smoothly connects normal star-forming galaxies to quiescent (red sequence)\ngalaxies via strong and weak AGN. We confirm that some galaxies with no H alpha\nemission show signs of SF in the UV. We derive a UV-based cosmic SFR density at\nz=0.1 with smaller total error than previous measurements (abridged).\n"}
{"text":"  The distribution of galaxies in position and velocity around the centers of\ngalaxy clusters encodes important information about cluster mass and structure.\nUsing the maxBCG galaxy cluster catalog identified from imaging data obtained\nin the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we study the BCG-galaxy velocity correlation\nfunction.

The mean velocity dispersion increases\nfrom 202+\/-10 km\/s for small groups to more than 854+\/-102 km\/s for large\nclusters. We show the scatter to be at most 40.5+\/-3.5%, declining to\n14.9+\/-9.4% in the richest bins.

Our methods are robust, measuring the scatter to well within\none-sigma of the true value, and the mean to within 10%, in the mock catalogs.\nBy convolving the scatter in velocity dispersion at fixed richness with the\nobserved richness space density function, we measure the velocity dispersion\nfunction of the maxBCG galaxy clusters. Although velocity dispersion and\nrichness do not form a true mass-observable relation, the relationship between\nvelocity dispersion and mass is theoretically well characterized and has low\nscatter.

{"text":"  We calculate exactly the von Neumann and topological entropies of the toric\ncode as a function of system size and temperature. We do so for systems with\ninfinite energy scale separation between magnetic and electric excitations, so\nthat the magnetic closed loop structure is fully preserved while the electric\nloop structure is tampered with by thermally excited electric charges. We find\nthat the entanglement entropy is a singular function of temperature and system\nsize, and that the limit of zero temperature and the limit of infinite system\nsize do not commute. From the entanglement entropy we obtain the topological\nentropy, which is shown to drop to half its zero-temperature value for any\ninfinitesimal temperature in the thermodynamic limit, and remains constant as\nthe temperature is further increased. Such discontinuous behavior is replaced\nby a smooth decreasing function in finite-size systems. If the separation of\nenergy scales in the system is large but finite, we argue that our results hold\nat small enough temperature and finite system size, and a second drop in the\ntopological entropy should occur as the temperature is raised so as to disrupt\nthe magnetic loop structure by allowing the appearance of free magnetic\ncharges. We interpret our results as an indication that the underlying magnetic\nand electric closed loop structures contribute equally to the topological\nentropy (and therefore to the topological order) in the system. Since each loop\nstructure \\emph{per se} is a classical object, we interpret the quantum\ntopological order in our system as arising from the ability of the two\nstructures to be superimposed and appear simultaneously.\n"}

Our goal is to investigate the nature of the near-UV\nlight in these objects, its relation to the circumnuclear starburst phenomenon,\nand the connection of this to the evolution and growth of the galaxy bulge and\ncentral black hole. In this paper, we describe the near-UV morphology of the\nobjects and characterize the near-UV emission. We estimate the size and the\nluminosity of the emitting regions and extract the luminosity profile. We also\ndetermine the presence of unresolved compact nuclei. In addition, the\ncircumnuclear stellar cluster population is identified, and the contribution of\nthe stellar clusters to the total light, at this wavelength, is estimated. The\nsize of the sample allows us to draw robust statistical conclusions. We find\nthat {Seyfert 1} galaxies are completely dominated by its bright and compact\nnucleus, that remains point-like at this resolution, while we find almost no\nunresolved nucleus in Seyfert 2. The Seyfert types 1 and 2 are quite segregated\nin an asymmetry vs compactness plot. Stellar clusters are found somewhat more\nfrequently in Sy2 (in ~70% of the galaxies) than in Sy1 (~57%), and contribute\nmore to the total light in Sy2, but this two differences seem to be mostly due\nto the large contribution of the compact nucleus in Sy1, as the luminosity\ndistribution of the clusters is similar in both Sy types.\n"}
{"text":"  In recent years, strong analogies have been established between the physics\nof acoustic perturbations in an inhomogeneous dynamical fluid system, and some\nkinematic features of space-time in general relativity. An effective metric,\nreferred to as the `acoustic metric', which describes the geometry of the\nmanifold in which acoustic perturbations propagate, can be constructed. This\neffective geometry can capture the properties of curved space-time in general\nrelativity. Physical models constructed utilizing such analogies are called\n`analogue gravity models'. Classical analogue gravity effect may be observed\nwhen acoustic perturbations propagate through a inhomogeneous transonic\nclassical fluid. The acoustic horizon, which resembles a black hole event\nhorizon in many ways, is generated at the transonic point in the fluid flow.\nThe acoustic horizon is essentially a null hyper surface, generators of which\nare the acoustic null geodesics, i.e. the phonons. The acoustic horizon emits\nacoustic radiation with quasi thermal phonon spectra, which is analogous to the\nactual Hawking radiation.

{"text":"  The organization of the connectivity between mammalian cortical areas has\nbecome a major subject of study, because of its important role in scaffolding\nthe macroscopic aspects of animal behavior and intelligence. In this study we\npresent a computational reconstruction approach to the problem of network\norganization, by considering the topological and spatial features of each area\nin the primate cerebral cortex as subsidy for the reconstruction of the global\ncortical network connectivity. Starting with all areas being disconnected,\npairs of areas with similar sets of features are linked together, in an attempt\nto recover the original network structure. Inferring primate cortical\nconnectivity from the properties of the nodes, remarkably good reconstructions\nof the global network organization could be obtained, with the topological\nfeatures allowing slightly superior accuracy to the spatial ones. Analogous\nreconstruction attempts for the C. elegans neuronal network resulted in\nsubstantially poorer recovery, indicating that cortical area interconnections\nare relatively stronger related to the considered topological and spatial\nproperties than neuronal projections in the nematode. The close relationship\nbetween area-based features and global connectivity may hint on developmental\nrules and constraints for cortical networks. Particularly, differences between\nthe predictions from topological and spatial properties, together with the\npoorer recovery resulting from spatial properties, indicate that the\norganization of cortical networks is not entirely determined by spatial\nconstraints.\n"}
{"text":"  In spectroscopy, it is conventional to treat pulses much stronger than the\nlinewidth as delta-functions. In NMR, this assumption leads to the prediction\nthat pi pulses do not refocus the dipolar coupling.

Observed effects include a long tail in the CPMG\necho train for short delays between pi pulses, an even-odd asymmetry in the\necho amplitudes for long delays, an unusual fingerprint pattern for\nintermediate delays, and a strong sensitivity to pi-pulse phase. Experiments\nthat set limits on possible extrinsic causes for the phenomena are reported. We\nfind that the action of the system's internal Hamiltonian during any real pulse\nis sufficient to cause the effects.

{"text":"  We show numerically that in a binary system of Yukawa particles, a dispersity\ndriven disordering transition occurs. In the presence of quenched disorder this\ndisordering transition coincides with a marked increase in the depinning\nthreshold, known as a peak effect.

If the quenched disorder is strong\nenough to create a significant amount of topological disorder in the\nmonodisperse system, addition of a poorly pinned species generates further\ndisorder but does not produce a peak in the depinning force. Our results\nindicate that for binary mixtures, optimal pinning occurs for topological\ndefect fraction densities of 0.2 to 0.25. For defect densities below this\nrange, the system retains orientational order.

{"text":"  In this work we study the ac dissipation of mesoscopic superconductors at\nmicrowave frequencies using the time dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations. Our\nnumerical simulations show that the ac dissipation is strongly dependent on the\norientation of the ac magnetic field ($h_{ac}$) relative to the dc magnetic\nfield ($H_{dc}$). When $h_{ac}$ is parallel to $H_{dc}$ we observe that each\nvortex penetration event produces a significant supression of the ac losses\nbecause the imaginary part of the ac susceptibility as a function of $H_{dc}$\nincreases before the penetration of vortices, and then it decreases abruptly\nafter vortices have entered into the sample. In the second case, when $h_{ac}$\nis perpendicular to $H_{dc}$, we observe that the jumps in dissipation occur at\nthe same values of $H_{dc}$ but are much smaller than in the parallel\nconfiguration.

Without cooling, virial\nheating occurs in shocks close to the virial radius for material falling in\nfrom voids. Material in dense filaments penetrates deeper to about half that\nradius. With cooling the virial shock position shrinks and also the filaments\nreach scales as small as a third the virial radius.

Therefore, additional mechanisms must be responsible for\ntheir formation and motion. We argue that the properties of the filaments are\nprobably related to an outflow from the disk of young mass-losing stars around\nSgrA*. In part, the outflow may originate from the black hole itself. We also\npresent some evidence and theoretical considerations that the outflow may be\ncollimated.\n"}
{"text":"  We recently proposed an empirical approach for the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal\n(LPM) effects in photon emission from the quark gluon plasma as a function of\nphoton mass. This approach was based on Generalized Emission Functions (GEF)\nfor photon emission, derived at a fixed temperature and strong coupling\nconstant. In the present work, we have extended the LPM calculations for\nseveral temperatures and strong coupling strengths. The integral equations for\n(${\\bf \\tilde{f}(\\tilde{p}_\\perp)}$) and ($\\tilde{g}({\\bf \\tilde{p}_\\perp})$)\nare solved by the iterations method for the variable set\n\\{$p_0,q_0,Q^2,T,\\alpha_s$\\}, considering bremsstrahlung and $\\bf aws$\nprocesses. We generalize the dynamical scaling variables, $x_T$, $x_L$, for\nbremsstrahlung and {\\bf aws} processes which are now functions of variables\n$p_0,q_0,Q^2,T,\\alpha_s$. The GEF introduced earlier, $g^b_T$, $g^a_T$,\n$g^b_L$, $g^a_L$, are also generalized for any temperatures and coupling\nstrengths. From this, the imaginary part of the photon polarization tensor as a\nfunction of photon mass and energy can be calculated as a one dimensional\nintegral over these GEF and parton distribution functions in the plasma.\nHowever, for phenomenological studies of experimental data, one needs a simple\nempirical formula without involving parton momentum integrations. Therefore, we\npresent a phenomenological formula for imaginary photon polarization tensor as\na function of \\{$q_0,Q^2,T,\\alpha_s$\\} that includes bremsstrahlung and $\\bf\naws$ mechanisms along with LPM effects.\n"}
{"text":"  Aims: Today, large ground-based instruments, like VISIR on the VLT, providing\ndiffraction-limited (about 0.3 arcsec) images in the mid-infrared where strong\nPAH features appear enable us to see the flaring structure of the disks around\nHerbig Ae stars.\n  Although great progress has been made in modelling the disk with radiative\ntransfer models able to reproduce the spectral energy distribution (SED) of\nHerbig Ae stars, the constraints brought by images have not been yet fully\nexploited. Here, we are interested in checking if these new observational\nimaging constraints can be accounted for by predictions based on existing\nmodels of passive centrally irradiated hydrostatic disks made to fit the SEDs\nof the Herbig Ae stars.\n  Methods: The images taken by VISIR in the 8.6 and 11.3 microns aromatic\nfeatures reveal a large flaring disk around HD97048 inclined to the line of\nsight. In order to analyse the spatial distribution of these data, we use a\ndisk model which includes the most up to date understanding of disk structure\nand physics around Herbig Ae stars with grains in thermal equilibrium in\naddition to transiently-heated PAHs.\n  Results: We compare the observed spatial distribution of the PAH emission\nfeature and the adjacent continuum emission with predictions based on existing\nfull disk models. Both SED and spatial distribution are in very good agreement\nwith the model predictions for common disk parameters.\n  Conclusions: We take the general agreement between observations and\npredictions as a strong support for the physical pictures underlying our flared\ndisk model.\n"}
{"text":"  We here report on the multiwavelength study which led us to the\nidentification of X-ray source IGR J16194-2810 as a new Symbiotic X-ray Binary\n(SyXB), that is, a rare type of Low Mass X-ray Binary (LMXB) composed of a\nM-type giant and a compact object. Using the accurate X-ray position allowed by\nSwift\/XRT data, we pinpointed the optical counterpart, a M2 III star. Besides,\nthe combined use of the spectral information afforded by XRT and INTEGRAL\/IBIS\nshows that the 0.5-200 keV spectrum of this source can be described with an\nabsorbed Comptonization model, usually found in LMXBs and, in particular, in\nSyXBs. No long-term (days to months) periodicities are detected in the IBIS\ndata. The time coverage afforded by XRT reveals shot-noise variability typical\nof accreting Galactic X-ray sources, but is not good enough to explore the\npresence of X-ray short-term (seconds to hours) oscillations in detail. By\nusing the above information, we infer important parameters for this source such\nas its distance (about 3.7 kpc) and X-ray luminosity (about 1.4e35 erg\/s in the\n0.5-200 keV band), and we give a description for this system (typical of SyXBs)\nin which a compact object (possibly a neutron star) accretes from the wind of\nits M-type giant companion. We also draw some comparisons between IGR\nJ16194-2810 and other sources belonging to this subclass, finding that this\nobject resembles SyXBs 4U 1700+24 and 4U 1954+31.\n"}
{"text":"  Flow-induced instabilities are relevant for the storage and dynamics of\nmagnetic fields in stellar convection zones and possibly also in other\nastrophysical contexts. We continue the study started in the first paper of\nthis series by considering the stability properties of longitudinal flows along\nmagnetic flux tubes. A linear stability analysis was carried out to determine\ncriteria for the onset of instability in the framework of the approximation of\nthin magnetic flux tubes. In the non-dissipative case, we find Kelvin-Helmholtz\ninstability for flow velocities exceeding a critical speed that depends on the\nAlfv{\\'e}n speed and on the ratio of the internal and external densities.\nInclusion of a friction term proportional to the relative transverse velocity\nleads to a friction-driven instability connected with backward (or negative\nenergy) waves. We discuss the physical nature of this instability. In the case\nof a stratified external medium, the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and the\nfriction-driven instability can set in for flow speeds significantly lower than\nthe Alfv{\\'e}n speed. Dissipative effects can excite flow-driven instability\nbelow the thresholds for the Kelvin-Helmholtz and the undulatory (Parker-type)\ninstabilities. This may be important for magnetic flux storage in stellar\nconvection zones and for the stability of astrophysical jets.\n"}
{"text":"  We apply a recently developed perturbative formalism which describes the\nevolution under their self-gravity of particles displaced from a perfect\nlattice to quantify precisely, up to shell crossing, the effects of\ndiscreteness in dissipationless cosmological N-body simulations. We give simple\nexpressions, explicitly dependent on the particle density, for the evolution of\npower in each mode as a function of red-shift. For typical starting red-shifts\nthe effect of finite particle number is to {\\it slow down} slightly the growth\nof power compared to that in the fluid limit (e.g. by about ten percent at half\nthe Nyquist frequency), and to induce also dispersion in the growth as a\nfunction of direction at a comparable level. In the limit that the initial\nred-shift tends to infinity, at fixed particle density, the evolution in fact\ndiverges from that in the fluid limit (described by the Zeldovich\napproximation). Contrary to widely held belief, this means that a simulation\nstarted at a red-shift much higher than the red-shift of shell crossing\nactually gives a worse, rather than a better, result. We also study how these\neffects are modified when there is a small-scale regularization of the\ngravitational force. We show that such a smoothing may reduce the anisotropy of\nthe discreteness effects, but it then {\\it increases} their average effect.\nThis behaviour illustrates the fact that the discreteness effects described\nhere are distinct from those usually considered in this context, due to\ntwo-body collisions. Indeed the characteristic time for divergence from the\ncollisionless limit is proportional to $N^{2\/3}$, rather than $N\/ \\log N$ in\nthe latter case.\n"}
{"text":"  The science of complex networks is a new interdisciplinary branch of science\nwhich has arisen recently on the interface of physics, biology, social and\ncomputer sciences, and others. Its main goal is to discover general laws\ngoverning the creation and growth as well as processes taking place on\nnetworks, like e.g. the Internet, transportation or neural networks. It turned\nout that most real-world networks cannot be simply reduced to a compound of\nsome individual components. Fortunately, the statistical mechanics, being one\nof pillars of modern physics, provides us with a very powerful set of tools and\nmethods for describing and understanding these systems. In this thesis, we\nwould like to present a consistent approach to complex networks based on\nstatistical mechanics, with the central role played by the concept of\nstatistical ensemble of networks. We show how to construct such a theory and\npresent some practical problems where it can be applied. Among them, we pay\nattention to the problem of finite-size corrections and the dynamics of a\nsimple model of mass transport on networks.\n"}
{"text":"  In performing a Bayesian analysis of astronomical data, two difficult\nproblems often emerge. First, in estimating the parameters of some model for\nthe data, the resulting posterior distribution may be multimodal or exhibit\npronounced (curving) degeneracies, which can cause problems for traditional\nMCMC sampling methods. Second, in selecting between a set of competing models,\ncalculation of the Bayesian evidence for each model is computationally\nexpensive. The nested sampling method introduced by Skilling (2004), has\ngreatly reduced the computational expense of calculating evidences and also\nproduces posterior inferences as a by-product. This method has been applied\nsuccessfully in cosmological applications by Mukherjee et al. (2006), but their\nimplementation was efficient only for unimodal distributions without pronounced\ndegeneracies. Shaw et al. (2007), recently introduced a clustered nested\nsampling method which is significantly more efficient in sampling from\nmultimodal posteriors and also determines the expectation and variance of the\nfinal evidence from a single run of the algorithm, hence providing a further\nincrease in efficiency. In this paper, we build on the work of Shaw et al. and\npresent three new methods for sampling and evidence evaluation from\ndistributions that may contain multiple modes and significant degeneracies; we\nalso present an even more efficient technique for estimating the uncertainty on\nthe evaluated evidence. These methods lead to a further substantial improvement\nin sampling efficiency and robustness, and are applied to toy problems to\ndemonstrate the accuracy and economy of the evidence calculation and parameter\nestimation. Finally, we discuss the use of these methods in performing Bayesian\nobject detection in astronomical datasets.\n"}
{"text":"  This paper includes a reflection on the role of networks in the study of\nEnglish language acquisition, as well as a collection of practical criteria to\nannotate free-speech corpora from children utterances. At the theoretical\nlevel, the main claim of this paper is that syntactic networks should be\ninterpreted as the outcome of the use of the syntactic machinery. Thus, the\nintrinsic features of such machinery are not accessible directly from (known)\nnetwork properties. Rather, what one can see are the global patterns of its use\nand, thus, a global view of the power and organization of the underlying\ngrammar. Taking a look into more practical issues, the paper examines how to\nbuild a net from the projection of syntactic relations. Recall that, as opposed\nto adult grammars, early-child language has not a well-defined concept of\nstructure. To overcome such difficulty, we develop a set of systematic criteria\nassuming constituency hierarchy and a grammar based on lexico-thematic\nrelations. At the end, what we obtain is a well defined corpora annotation that\nenables us i) to perform statistics on the size of structures and ii) to build\na network from syntactic relations over which we can perform the standard\nmeasures of complexity. We also provide a detailed example.\n"}
{"text":"  We present an exhaustive study of more than 250 ab initio potential energy\nsurfaces (PESs) of the model dipeptide HCO-L-Ala-NH2. The model chemistries\n(MCs) used are constructed as homo- and heterolevels involving possibly\ndifferent RHF and MP2 calculations for the geometry and the energy. The basis\nsets used belong to a sample of 39 selected representants from Pople's\nsplit-valence families, ranging from the small 3-21G to the large\n6-311++G(2df,2pd). The reference PES to which the rest are compared is the\nMP2\/6-311++G(2df,2pd) homolevel, which, as far as we are aware, is the more\naccurate PES of a dipeptide in the literature. The aim of the study presented\nis twofold: On the one hand, the evaluation of the influence of polarization\nand diffuse functions in the basis set, distinguishing between those placed at\n1st-row atoms and those placed at hydrogens, as well as the effect of different\ncontraction and valence splitting schemes. On the other hand, the investigation\nof the heterolevel assumption, which is defined here to be that which states\nthat heterolevel MCs are more efficient than homolevel MCs. The heterolevel\napproximation is very commonly used in the literature, but it is seldom\nchecked. As far as we know, the only tests for peptides or related systems,\nhave been performed using a small number of conformers, and this is the first\ntime that this potentially very economical approximation is tested in full\nPESs. In order to achieve these goals, all data sets have been compared and\nanalyzed in a way which captures the nearness concept in the space of MCs.\n"}
{"text":"  We constrain blastwave parameters and the circumburst media of a subsample of\nten BeppoSAX Gamma-Ray Bursts. For this sample we derive the values of the\ninjected electron energy distribution index, p, and the density structure index\nof the circumburst medium, k, from simultaneous spectral fits to their X-ray,\noptical and nIR afterglow data. The spectral fits have been done in count space\nand include the effects of metallicity, and are compared with the previously\nreported optical and X-ray temporal behaviour. Using the blastwave model and\nsome assumptions which include on-axis viewing and standard jet structure,\nconstant blastwave energy and no evolution of the microphysical parameters, we\nfind a mean value of p for the sample as a whole of 2.04 +0.02\/-0.03. A\nstatistical analysis of the distribution demonstrates that the p values in this\nsample are inconsistent with a single universal value for p at the 3-sigma\nlevel or greater, which has significant implications for particle acceleration\nmodels. This approach provides us with a measured distribution of circumburst\ndensity structures rather than considering only the cases of k=0 (homogeneous)\nand k=2 (wind-like). We find five GRBs for which k can be well constrained, and\nin four of these cases the circumburst medium is clearly wind-like.

{"text":"  Late long-term potentiation (L-LTP) appears essential for the formation of\nlong-term memory, with memories at least partly encoded by patterns of\nstrengthened synapses. How memories are preserved for months or years, despite\nmolecular turnover, is not well understood. Ongoing recurrent neuronal\nactivity, during memory recall or during sleep, has been hypothesized to\npreferentially potentiate strong synapses, preserving memories. This hypothesis\nhas not been evaluated in the context of a mathematical model representing\nbiochemical pathways important for L-LTP. I incorporated ongoing activity into\ntwo such models: a reduced model that represents some of the essential\nbiochemical processes, and a more detailed published model. The reduced model\nrepresents synaptic tagging and gene induction intuitively, and the detailed\nmodel adds activation of essential kinases by Ca. Ongoing activity was modeled\nas continual brief elevations of [Ca]. In each model, two stable states of\nsynaptic weight resulted. Positive feedback between synaptic weight and the\namplitude of ongoing Ca transients underlies this bistability. A tetanic or\ntheta-burst stimulus switches a model synapse from a low weight to a high\nweight stabilized by ongoing activity. Bistability was robust to parameter\nvariations. Simulations illustrated that prolonged decreased activity reset\nsynapses to low weights, suggesting a plausible forgetting mechanism. However,\nepisodic activity with shorter inactive intervals maintained strong synapses.\nBoth models support experimental predictions. Tests of these predictions are\nexpected to further understanding of how neuronal activity is coupled to\nmaintenance of synaptic strength.\n"}
{"text":"  We use an effective field theory (EFT) which contains only short-range\ninteractions to study the dependence of a variety of three-nucleon observables\non the pion mass.

{"text":"  Current methods for producing single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) lead to\nheterogeneous samples containing mixtures of metallic and semiconducting\nspecies with a variety of lengths and defects.

For nonhierarchical neutrinos, renormalisation group\nevolution down to a laboratory energy scale $\\lambda \\sim 10^3$ GeV tends to\nradiatively break these symmetries at a significant level and spoil the mixing\npattern predicted by them. However, for Majorana neutrinos, suitable\nconstraints on the extra phases $\\alpha_{2,3}$ enable the retention of those\nhigh scale mixing patterns at laboratory energies.

{"text":"  Significant alignment and signed-intensity anomalies of local features of the\ncosmic microwave background (CMB) are detected on the three-year WMAP data,\nthrough a decomposition of the signal with steerable wavelets on the sphere.\nFirstly, an alignment analysis identifies two mean preferred planes in the sky,\nboth with normal axes close to the CMB dipole axis. The first plane is defined\nby the directions toward which local CMB features are anomalously aligned. A\nmean preferred axis is also identified in this plane, located very close to the\necliptic poles axis. The second plane is defined by the directions anomalously\navoided by local CMB features. This alignment anomaly provides further insight\non recent results (Wiaux et al. 2006). Secondly, a signed-intensity analysis\nidentifies three mean preferred directions in the southern galactic hemisphere\nwith anomalously high or low temperature of local CMB features: a cold spot\nessentially identified with a known cold spot (Vielva et al. 2004), a second\ncold spot lying very close to the southern end of the CMB dipole axis, and a\nhot spot lying close to the southern end of the ecliptic poles axis. In both\nanalyses, the anomalies are observed at wavelet scales corresponding to angular\nsizes around 10 degress on the celestial sphere, with global significance\nlevels around 1%.

The spectrum is consistent with\nprevious suggestions that the power-law components are X-ray emission from the\nsub-pc VLBI jet and from Bondi accretion at the core, but it is also consistent\nwith a partial covering interpretation. The soft band is dominated by thermal\nemission from the diffuse plasma and is fit well by a two-temperature VAPEC\nmodel, plus a third power-law component to account for scattered nuclear\nemission, jet emission, and emission from X-ray Binaries and other point\nsources.

{"text":"  In nuclear chiral perturbation theory (ChPT), an operator is defined in a\nspace with a cutoff which may be varied within a certain range. The operator\nruns as a result of the variation of the cutoff [renormalization group (RG)\nrunning]. In order for ChPT to be useful, the operator should run in a way\nconsistent with the counting rule; that is, the running of chiral counter terms\nhave to be of natural size. We vary the cutoff using the Wilsonian\nrenormalization group (WRG) equation, and examine this consistency. As an\nexample, we study the s-wave pion production operator for NN\\to d pi, derived\nin ChPT. We demonstrate that the WRG running does not generate any\nchiral-symmetry-violating (CSV) interaction, provided that we start with an\noperator which does not contain a CSV term. We analytically show how the\ncounter terms are generated in the WRG running in case of the infinitesimal\ncutoff reduction. Based on the analytic result, we argue a range of the cutoff\nvariation for which the running of the counter terms is of natural size. Then,\nwe numerically confirm this.\n"}
{"text":"  Community structure is an important property of complex networks. An\nautomatic discovery of such structure is a fundamental task in many\ndisciplines, including sociology, biology, engineering, and computer science.\nRecently, several community discovery algorithms have been proposed based on\nthe optimization of a quantity called modularity (Q). However, the problem of\nmodularity optimization is NP-hard, and the existing approaches often suffer\nfrom prohibitively long running time or poor quality. Furthermore, it has been\nrecently pointed out that algorithms based on optimizing Q will have a\nresolution limit, i.e., communities below a certain scale may not be detected.\nIn this research, we first propose an efficient heuristic algorithm, Qcut,\nwhich combines spectral graph partitioning and local search to optimize Q.\nUsing both synthetic and real networks, we show that Qcut can find higher\nmodularities and is more scalable than the existing algorithms. Furthermore,\nusing Qcut as an essential component, we propose a recursive algorithm, HQcut,\nto solve the resolution limit problem. We show that HQcut can successfully\ndetect communities at a much finer scale and with a higher accuracy than the\nexisting algorithms. Finally, we apply Qcut and HQcut to study a\nprotein-protein interaction network, and show that the combination of the two\nalgorithms can reveal interesting biological results that may be otherwise\nundetectable.\n"}
{"text":"  Past work has shown that ions can pass through a membrane more readily in one\ndirection than the other. We demonstrate here in a model and an experiment that\nfor a mixture of small and large particles such asymmetric diffusion can arise\nsolely from an asymmetry in the geometry of the pores of the membrane. Our\ndeterministic simulation considers a two-dimensional gas of elastic disks of\ntwo sizes diffusing through a membrane, and our laboratory experiment examines\nthe diffusion of glass beads of two sizes through a metal membrane. In both\nexperiment and simulation, the membrane is permeable only to the smaller\nparticles, and the asymmetric pores lead to an asymmetry in the diffusion rates\nof these particles. The presence of even a small percentage of large particles\ncan clog a membrane, preventing passage of the small particles in one direction\nwhile permitting free flow of the small particles in the other direction. The\npurely geometric kinetic constraints may play a role in common biological\ncontexts such as membrane ion channels.\n"}
{"text":"  Recent lattice calculations showed that the quarkonia will survive beyond the\nphase transition temperature, and will dissolve at different temperatures\ndepending on the type of the quarkonium.

The input of the calculation are the parton quarkonium\ndissociation cross section to NLO in QCD, the quarkonium wave function in a\ntemperature-dependent potential from lattice QCD, and a thermal distribution of\npartons with thermal masses. We find that for the J\/psi, the total thermal\nwidth above 1.4 Tc becomes larger than 100 to 250 MeV, depending on the\neffective thermal masses of the quark and gluon, which we take between 400 to\n600 MeV. Such a width corresponds to an effective dissociation cross section by\ngluons between 1.5 to 3.5 mb and by quarks 1 to 2 mb at 1.4 Tc. However, at\nsimilar temperatures, we find a much smaller thermal width and effective cross\nsection for the upsilon.\n"}

The residual flux in the overlapping trough\nis well fit by the product of the residual fluxes in the unblended troughs. For\nthese optically thick systems to yield such a result, at least one of them must\nconsist of individual subunits rather than being a single structure with\nvelocity-dependent coverage of the source.

{"text":"  Two approaches for closing the turbulence subgrid-scale stress tensor in\nterms of matrix exponentials are introduced and compared. The first approach is\nbased on a formal solution of the stress transport equation in which the\nproduction terms can be integrated exactly in terms of matrix exponentials.\nThis formal solution of the subgrid-scale stress transport equation is shown to\nbe useful to explore special cases, such as the response to constant velocity\ngradient, but neglecting pressure-strain correlations and diffusion effects.\nThe second approach is based on an Eulerian-Lagrangian change of variables,\ncombined with the assumption of isotropy for the conditionally averaged\nLagrangian velocity gradient tensor and with the `Recent Fluid Deformation'\n(RFD) approximation. It is shown that both approaches lead to the same basic\nclosure in which the stress tensor is expressed as the product of the matrix\nexponential of the resolved velocity gradient tensor multiplied by its\ntranspose. Short-time expansions of the matrix exponentials are shown to\nprovide an eddy-viscosity term and particular quadratic terms, and thus allow a\nreinterpretation of traditional eddy-viscosity and nonlinear stress closures.\nThe basic feasibility of the matrix-exponential closure is illustrated by\nimplementing it successfully in Large Eddy Simulation of forced isotropic\nturbulence. The matrix-exponential closure employs the drastic approximation of\nentirely omitting the pressure-strain correlation and other `nonlinear\nscrambling' terms. But unlike eddy-viscosity closures, the matrix exponential\napproach provides a simple and local closure that can be derived directly from\nthe stress transport equation with the production term, and using physically\nmotivated assumptions about Lagrangian decorrelation and upstream isotropy.\n"}

We show that the $\\ln^2 x$ terms come\npartly from the light-cone wave function(LCWF) and partly from the form factor.\nWe introduce a jet factor to factorize the $\\ln^2 x$ term in the form factor.\nTo handel the $\\ln^2 x$ terms from the LCWF we introduce a nonstandard\nlight-cone wave function(NLCWF) with the gauge links off the light-cone\ndirection.

The original method, however, often fails\nin reproducing the true ground state and causes systematic errors of calculated\nphysical quantities because the samples are often trapped in some metastable or\nsymmetry broken states. To overcome this difficulty, we combine the\nquantum-number projection scheme proposed by Assaad, Werner, Corboz, Gull and\nTroyer in conjunction with the importance sampling of the original GBMC method.\nThis improvement allows us to carry out the importance sampling in the\nquantum-number-projected phase-space.

{"text":"  In this paper we analyse the mechanisms responsible for the bonding of\nelectrons to metal surfaces. We present and validate a method to measure the\nenergy distribution of dense electron ensembles at ambient conditions. We have\nfound sharp structures in the energy distribution of charge confined at metal\nsurfaces. These structures correspond to the onset of space charge i.e.\nelectron emission. The threshold energy for emission increases linear with the\nfree electron density. We conclude that the work function is a direct measure\nof the Hartree-Fock exchange energy. Remarkably, the emissions that have been\nobserved do not obey the Einstein-Millikan threshold relation for the photo\nelectric effect. By discrimination between requirements for energy and momentum\nwe deduce that electron emissions are trigged by photon momentum. We claim that\nthe photo electric effect is the result of a phase transition in an electron\ngas that connects a surface bound, condensed state to a free continuum state.\nThe assignment of a phase transition to the effect under consideration is\njustified by analyzing the behaviour of the Fermi-Dirac energy distribution\nupon raising the Fermi level. We predict an abrupt increment in the number of\nelectrons in the continuum that exceeds 70 orders of magnitude.

{"text":"  If the binding energy of the pulsar's surface is not so high (the case of a\nneutron star), both the negative and positive charges will flow out freely from\nthe surface of the star. The annular free flow model for $\\gamma$-ray emission\nof pulsars is suggested in this paper. It is emphasized that: (1). Two kinds of\nacceleration regions (annular and core) need to be taken into account. The\nannular acceleration region is defined by the magnetic field lines that cross\nthe null charge surface within the light cylinder. (2). If the potential drop\nin the annular region of a pulsar is high enough (normally the cases of young\npulsars), charges in both the annular and the core regions could be accelerated\nand produce primary gamma-rays. Secondary pairs are generated in both regions\nand stream outwards to power the broadband radiations. (3). The potential drop\nin the annular region grows more rapidly than that in the core region. The\nannular acceleration process is a key point to produce wide emission beams as\nobserved. (4). The advantages of both the polar cap and outer gap models are\nretained in this model. The geometric properties of the $\\gamma$-ray emission\nfrom the annular flow is analogous to that presented in a previous work by Qiao\net al., which match the observations well. (5).

{"text":"  Background: Duplication of genes is important for evolution of molecular\nnetworks. Many authors have therefore considered gene duplication as a driving\nforce in shaping the topology of molecular networks. In particular it has been\nnoted that growth via duplication would act as an implicit way of preferential\nattachment, and thereby provide the observed broad degree distributions of\nmolecular networks.\n  Results: We extend current models of gene duplication and rewiring by\nincluding directions and the fact that molecular networks are not a result of\nunidirectional growth. We introduce upstream sites and downstream shapes to\nquantify potential links during duplication and rewiring. We find that this in\nitself generates the observed scaling of transcription factors for genome sites\nin procaryotes. The dynamical model can generate a scale-free degree\ndistribution, p(k)&prop; 1\/k^&gamma;, with exponent &gamma;=1 in the\nnon-growing case, and with &gamma;>1 when the network is growing.\n  Conclusions: We find that duplication of genes followed by substantial\nrecombination of upstream regions could generate main features of genetic\nregulatory networks. Our steady state degree distribution is however to broad\nto be consistent with data, thereby suggesting that selective pruning acts as a\nmain additional constraint on duplicated genes. Our analysis shows that gene\nduplication can only be a main cause for the observed broad degree\ndistributions, if there is also substantial recombinations between upstream\nregions of genes.\n"}

The layer is then fully\nfluidized since macroscopic, fluid-like phenomena such as convection rolls and\nsurface waves are observed. Increasing the total dissipation (by either\ndecreasing the restitution coefficient or increasing the total number of\nparticles) decreases the increase in granular temperature and rms particle\ndisplacement at fluidization, and shifts the increase to higher accelerations.\nIncreasing the frequency also decreases the magnitude of the jump, and shifts\nthe change to lower accelerations.\n"}
{"text":"  Trafficking of glutamate receptors into and out of synapses is critically\ninvolved in the plasticity of excitatory synaptic transmission. Endocytosis and\nexocytosis of receptors have initially been thought to account alone for this\ntrafficking. However, membrane proteins also traffic through surface lateral\ndiffusion in the plasma membrane. We describe developments in\nelectrophysiological and optical approaches that have allowed for the real time\nmeasurement of glutamate receptor surface trafficking in live neurons. These\ninclude (i) specific imaging of surface receptors using a pH sensitive\nfluorescent protein, (ii) design of a photoactivable drug to inactivate locally\nsurface receptors and monitor electrophysiologically their recovery, and\n(iii)application of single molecule fluorescence microscopy to directly track\nthe movement of individual surface receptors with nanometer resolution inside\nand outside synapses. Altogether, these approaches have demonstrated that\nglutamate receptors diffuse at high rates in the neuronal membrane and suggest\na key role for surface diffusion in the regulation of receptor numbers at\nsynapses.\n"}
{"text":"  In the last decade evidence has accumulated that small domains of 50-700 nm\nin diameter are located in the exoplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane. Most\nof these domains supposedly consist of specific sets of lipids and proteins,\nand are believed to coordinate signal transduction cascades. Whether similar\ndomains are also present in the cytoplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane is\nunclear so far. To investigate the presence of cytoplasmic leaflet domains, the\nH-Ras membrane-targeting sequence was fused to the C-terminus of the enhanced\nyellow fluorescent protein. Using single-molecule fluorescence microscopy,\ntrajectories of individual molecules diffusing in the cytoplasmic leaflet of\nthe plasma membrane were recorded. From these trajectories, the diffusion of\nindividual membrane-anchored enhanced yellow fluorescent protein molecules was\nstudied in live cells on timescales from 5 to 200 ms. The results show that the\ndiffusion of 30-40% of the molecules is constrained in domains with a typical\nsize of 200 nm. Neither breakdown of actin nor cholesterol extraction changed\nthe domain characteristics significantly, indicating that the observed domains\nmay not be related to the membrane domains identified so far.\n"}

Inside individual synapses, we\nfound immobile and mobile receptors, which display restricted diffusion.\nExtra-synaptic receptors display free diffusion. Receptors could also exchange\nbetween these membrane compartments through lateral diffusion. Glutamate\napplication increased both receptor mobility inside synapses and the fraction\nof mobile receptors present in a juxtasynaptic region.

The convergence of the algorithm is proved\nfor the matched filter, the decorrelator, and the MMSE receiver, and is\ndemonstrated by means of simulation for an optimal detector.

{"text":"  High-energy gamma-rays propagating in the intergalactic medium can interact\nwith background infrared photons to produce e+e- pairs, resulting in the\nabsorption of the intrinsic gamma-ray spectrum. TeV observations of the distant\nblazar 1ES 1101-232 were thus recently used to put an upper limit on the\ninfrared extragalactic background light density. The created pairs can\nupscatter background photons to high energies, which in turn may pair produce,\nthereby initiating a cascade. The pairs diffuse on the extragalactic magnetic\nfield (EMF) and cascade emission has been suggested as a means for measuring\nits intensity. Limits on the IR background and EMF are reconsidered taking into\naccount cascade emissions. The cascade equations are solved numerically.\nAssuming a power-law intrinsic spectrum, the observed 100 MeV - 100 TeV\nspectrum is found as a function of the intrinsic spectral index and the\nintensity of the EMF. Cascades emit mainly at or below 100 GeV. The observed\nTeV spectrum appears softer than for pure absorption when cascade emission is\ntaken into account. The upper limit on the IR photon background is found to be\nrobust. Inversely, the intrinsic spectra needed to fit the TeV data are\nuncomfortably hard when cascade emission makes a significant contribution to\nthe observed spectrum. An EMF intensity around 1e-8 nG leads to a\ncharacteristic spectral hump in the GLAST band. Higher EMF intensities divert\nthe pairs away from the line-of-sight and the cascade contribution to the\nspectrum becomes negligible.\n"}
{"text":"  N-body simulations give us a rough idea of how the shape of a simulated\nobject appears in three-dimensional space. From an observational point of view\nthis may give us a misleading picture. The faint stars may be the most common\nstars in the system but the morphological information obtained by observations\nof an object may be dominated by the color properties of the bright stars. Due\nto dynamical effects, such as energy equipartition, different masses of stars\nmay populate different regions in the object. Since stars are evolving in mass\nthe stellar evolution may also influence the dynamics of the system. Hence, if\none is interested in simulating what the morphology will look like through a\ntelescope, one needs to simulate in addition evolving stars and weight them by\ntheir luminosity. Therefore we need to combine simulations of the dynamical\nevolution and a stellar population synthesis at the same time. For the\ndynamical evolution part we use a parallel version of a direct N-body code,\nNBODY6++. This code also includes stellar evolution. We link the parameters\nfrom this stellar evolution routine to the BaSeL 2.0 stellar library. For\nisolated clusters we found results assimilable to standard stellar population\nsynthesis codes such as the PEGASE code. For clusters in a tidal field we found\nthat the integrated colors become relatively bluer due to energy equipartition\neffects. In the time shortly before dissolution of the cluster the stellar M\/L\nratio becomes lower compared to isolated clusters.

It is shown\nthat for flows with arbitrary shearing rate there exists a finite time interval\nof non-adiabatic evolution of the perturbations. The non-adiabatic behavior\nmanifests itself in a twofold way, viz. by the over-reflection of the GAWs and\nby the generation of GAWs from EM perturbations.

{"text":"  Context. Gas within a galaxy is forced to establish pressure balance against\ngravitational forces. The shape of an unperturbed gaseous disk can be used to\nconstrain dark matter models. Aims. We derive the 3-D HI volume density\ndistribution for the Milky Way out to a galactocentric radius of 40 kpc and a\nheight of 20 kpc to constrain the Galactic mass distribution. Methods. We used\nthe Leiden\/Argentine\/Bonn all sky 21-cm line survey. The transformation from\nbrightness temperatures to densities depends on the rotation curve. We explored\nseveral models, reflecting different dark matter distributions. Each of these\nmodels was set up to solve the combined Poisson-Boltzmann equation in a\nself-consistent way and optimized to reproduce the observed flaring. Results.\nBesides a massive extended halo of M ~ 1.8 10^{12} Msun, we find a\nself-gravitating dark matter disk with M=2 to 3 10^{11} Msun, including a dark\nmatter ring at 13 < R < 18.5 kpc with M = 2.2 to 2.8 10^{10} Msun. The\nexistence of the ring was previously postulated from EGRET data and coincides\nwith a giant stellar structure that surrounds the Galaxy. The resulting Milky\nWay rotation curve is flat up to R~27 kpc and slowly decreases outwards. The\n\\hi gas layer is strongly flaring. The HWHM scale height is 60 pc at R = 4 kpc\nand increases to ~2700$ pc at R=40 kpc. Spiral arms cause a noticeable imprint\non the gravitational field, at least out to R = 30 kpc. Conclusions. Our mass\nmodel supports previous proposals that the giant stellar ring structure is due\nto a merging dwarf galaxy. The fact that the majority of the dark matter in the\nMilky Way for $R \\la 40$ kpc can be successfully modeled by a self-gravitating\nisothermal disk raises the question of whether this massive disk may have been\ncaused by similar merger events in the past.\n"}

{"text":"  In this two-part paper, we consider the multiantenna multihop relay channels\nin which the source signal arrives at the destination through N independent\nrelaying hops in series. The main concern of this work is to design relaying\nstrategies that utilize efficiently the relays in such a way that the diversity\nis maximized. In part I, we focus on the amplify-and-forward (AF) strategy with\nwhich the relays simply scale the received signal and retransmit it. More\nspecifically, we characterize the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) of the\nAF scheme in a general multihop channel with arbitrary number of antennas and\narbitrary number of hops. The DMT is in closed-form expression as a function of\nthe number of antennas at each node. First, we provide some basic results on\nthe DMT of the general Rayleigh product channels. It turns out that these\nresults have very simple and intuitive interpretation. Then, the results are\napplied to the AF multihop channels which is shown to be equivalent to the\nRayleigh product channel, in the DMT sense. Finally, the project-and-forward\n(PF) scheme, a variant of the AF scheme, is proposed. We show that the PF\nscheme has the same DMT as the AF scheme, while the PF can have significant\npower gain over the AF scheme in some cases. In part II, we will derive the\nupper bound on the diversity of the multihop channels and show that it can be\nachieved by partitioning the multihop channel into AF subchannels.\n"}

For $Hw$ being the\nheart of $w$ (in $DM_{gm}$ we have $Hw=Chow$) we define a canonical\nconservative 'weakly exact' functor $t$ from our $C$ to a certain weak category\nof complexes $K_w(Hw)$.

The supernova\nejecta initially coasted outward at more than 10% of the speed of light, but in\n1990 were observed to decelerate rapidly as they began to encounter dense\ncircumstellar material expelled by the progenitor star. The resulting shock has\nsubsequently produced steadily brightening radio synchrotron emission, which is\nresolved by the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) into an expanding\nlimb-brightened shell. Here we present 15 years of ATCA imaging of Supernova\n1987A, at an effective angular resolution of 0.4 arcsec. We find that the radio\nremnant has accelerated in its expansion over this period, from approx 3600\nkm\/s in 1992 to approx 5200 km\/s at the end of 2006. The published diameters of\nthe evolving X-ray shell have been ~15% smaller than the corresponding radio\nvalues, but a simultaneous Fourier analysis of both radio and X-ray data\neliminates this discrepancy, and yields a current diameter for the shell in\nboth wave-bands of approx 1.7 arcsec. An asymmetric brightness distribution is\nseen in radio images at all ATCA epochs: the eastern and western rims have\nhigher fluxes than the northern and southern regions, indicating that most of\nthe radio emission comes from the equatorial plane of the system, where the\nprogenitor star's circumstellar wind is thought to be densest. The eastern lobe\nis brighter than and further from the supernova site than the western lobe,\nsuggesting an additional asymmetry in the initial distribution of supernova\nejecta.\n"}
{"text":"  We investigate the Gross-Pitaevskii equation for a classically chaotic\nsystem, which describes an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate confined in an\noptical lattice and driven by a spatiotemporal periodic laser field. It is\ndemonstrated that the exact Floquet states appear when the external\ntime-dependent potential is balanced by the nonlinear mean-field interaction.\nThe balance region of parameters is divided into a phase-continuing region and\na phase-jumping one. In the latter region, the Floquet states are\nspatiotemporal vortices of nontrivial phase structures and zero-density cores.\nDue to the velocity singularities of vortex cores and the blowing-up of\nperturbed solutions, the spatiotemporal vortices are unstable periodic states\nembedded in chaos. The stability and instability of these Floquet states are\nnumerically explored by the time evolution of fidelity between the exact and\nnumerical solutions. It is numerically illustrated that the stable Floquet\nstates could be prepared from the uniformly initial states by slow growth of\nthe external potential.\n"}

{"text":"  The physical characteristics of the Lyman-alpha forest cloud systems are\ncombined with observations on the baryonic mass density of the Universe and\nconstraints from primordial nucleosynthesis to set boundary conditions on the\nIntergalactic Medium (IGM) at the epoch of z=2.5. The Universe is considered a\nclosed system and allowed to expand adiabatically from the epoch when QSOs\nfirst ionized the IGM (5 <= z_on <= 20). The average kinetic energy of a gas is\ncalculated in the region where the gas transitions from relativistic to\nnon-relativistic behavior. All of the above measurements are then used to\ndetermine the thermal history of the IGM in the redshift range 2.5 <= z <=\nz_on. The hot IGM is assumed to inverse Compton scatter photons from the Cosmic\nMicrowave Background (CMBR) and consequently distort the CMBR as seen at the\npresent epoch. The temperature of the IGM at z=2.5 and the epoch z_on are\nadjusted, within the constraints defined above, to give the best overall\nagreement with published data on the temperature of the IGM. We find that the\nmodel of the IGM proposed here does not grossly distort the CMBR, and in fact\nagrees quite closely with the preliminary results from the Cosmic Background\nExplorer (COBE) satellite. However, our model of the IGM cannot explain the\nobserved cosmic x ray background.\n  This paper was originally written in 1990. It was never submitted for\npublication.\n"}
{"text":"  We present a Chandra X-ray observation of G12.82-0.02, a shell-like radio\nsupernova remnant coincident with the TeV gamma-ray source HESS J1813-178.

The morphology of the diffuse emission strongly resembles that of a\npulsar wind nebula. The spectrum of the compact source is well-characterized by\na power-law with index Gamma approx 1.3, typical of young and energetic\nrotation-powered pulsars. For a distance of 4.5 kpc, consistent with the X-ray\nabsorption and an association with the nearby star formation region W33, the\n2-10 keV X-ray luminosities of the putative pulsar and nebula are L(PSR) =\n3.2E33 ergs\/s and L(PWN) = 1.4E34 ergs\/s, respectively. Both the flux ratio of\nL(PWN)\/L(PSR) = 4.3 and the total luminosity of this system predict a pulsar\nspin-down power of Edot > 1E37 ergs\/s, placing it within the ten most energetic\nyoung pulsars in the Galaxy.

{"text":"  We present the results of a survey of 45 young (<250 Myr), close (<50 pc)\nstars with the Simultaneous Differential Imager (SDI) implemented at the VLT\nand the MMT for the direct detection of extrasolar planets. As part of the\nsurvey, we observed 54 objects total, of which 45 were close, young stars, 2\nwere somewhat more distant (<150 pc), very young (<10 Myr) stars, 3 were stars\nwith known radial velocity planets, and 4 were older, very nearby (<20 pc)\nsolar analogues. Our SDI devices use a double Wollaston prism and a quad filter\nto take images simultaneously at 3 wavelengths surrounding the 1.62 um methane\nabsorption bandhead found in the spectrum of cool brown dwarfs and gas giant\nplanets. In our VLT data, we achieved H band contrasts > 10 mag (5 sigma) at a\nseparation of 0.5\" from the primary star on 45% of our targets and H band\ncontrasts of > 9 mag at a separation of 0.5'' on 80% of our targets. With this\ndegree of attenuation, we should be able to image (5sigma detection) a 5\nM_{Jup} planet 15 AU from a 70 Myr K1 star at 15 pc or a 5 M_{Jup} planet at 2\nAU from a 12 Myr M star at 10 pc.

We then focus on the direct-action theory in which the\nadvanced and retarded contributions are present symmetrically, with no\nopportunity to supplement the particular integral solution of the wave equation\nwith an arbitrary complementary function.

{"text":"  We investigate the gravitational wake due to, and dynamical friction on, a\nperturber moving on a circular orbit in a uniform gaseous medium using a\nsemi-analytic method. This work is a straightforward extension of Ostriker\n(1999) who studied the case of a straight-line trajectory. The circular orbit\ncauses the bending of the wake in the background medium along the orbit,\nforming a long trailing tail. The wake distribution is thus asymmetric, giving\nrise to the drag forces in both opposite (azimuthal) and lateral (radial)\ndirections to the motion of the perturber, although the latter does not\ncontribute to orbital decay much. For subsonic motion, the density wake with a\nweak tail is simply a curved version of that in Ostriker and does not exhibit\nthe front-back symmetry. The resulting drag force in the opposite direction is\nremarkably similar to the finite-time, linear-trajectory counterpart. On the\nother hand, a supersonic perturber is able to overtake its own wake, possibly\nmultiple times, and develops a very pronounced tail. The supersonic tail\nsurrounds the perturber in a trailing spiral fashion, enhancing the perturbed\ndensity at the back as well as far front of the perturber. We provide the\nfitting formulae for the drag forces as functions of the Mach number, whose\nazimuthal part is surprisingly in good agreement with the Ostriker's formula,\nprovided Vp t=2 Rp, where Vp and Rp are the velocity and orbital radius of the\nperturber, respectively.\n"}

{"text":"  The relaxation dynamics of a model fluid of platelike colloidal particles is\ninvestigated by means of a phenomenological dynamic density functional theory.\nThe model fluid approximates the particles within the Zwanzig model of\nrestricted orientations.

These approximations are expected to lead to qualitatively\nreliable results for low densities as those within the isotropic-nematic\ntwo-phase region. The formalism is applied to model an initially spatially\nhomogeneous stable or metastable isotropic fluid which is perturbed by\nswitching a two-dimensional array of Gaussian laser beams. Switching on the\nlaser beams leads to an accumulation of colloidal particles in the beam\ncenters. If the initial chemical potential and the laser power are large enough\na preferred orientation of particles occurs breaking the symmetry of the laser\npotential. After switching off the laser beams again the system can follow\ndifferent relaxation paths: It either relaxes back to the homogeneous isotropic\nstate or it forms an approximately elliptical high-density core which is\nelongated perpendicular to the dominating orientation in order to minimize the\nsurface free energy.

Four-neutrino oscillations of the (3+1) type have been only\nmarginally allowed before the recent MiniBooNE results, and become even more\ndisfavored with the new data (at the level of $4\\sigma$). In the framework of\nso-called (3+2) five-neutrino mass schemes we find severe tension between\nappearance and disappearance experiments at the level of more than $3\\sigma$,\nand hence no satistfactory fit to the global data is possible in (3+2) schemes.\nThis tension remains also when a third sterile neutrino is added, and the\nquality of the global fit does not improve significantly in a (3+3) scheme. It\nshould be noted, however, that in models with more than one sterile neutrino\nthe MiniBooNE results are in perfect agreement with the LSND appearance\nevidence, thanks to the possibility of CP violation available in such\noscillation schemes.

These observations\nprovide one of the most sensitive studies of the radio continuum emission in\nthe central 500 parsecs.

{"text":"  Semiclassical reasoning suggests that the process by which an object\ncollapses into a black hole and then evaporates by emitting Hawking radiation\nmay destroy information, a problem often referred to as the black hole\ninformation paradox.

We propose that the\nlatter aspect of the paradox may be a manifestation of an inconsistent\nself-reference in the semiclassical theory of black hole evolution. This\nsuggests the inadequacy of the semiclassical approach or, at worst, that\nstandard quantum mechanics and general relavity are fundamentally incompatible.\nOne option for the resolution for the paradox in the localization is to\nidentify the G\\\"odel-like incompleteness that corresponds to an imposition of\nconsistency, and introduce possibly new physics that supplies this\nincompleteness.

It\nalso allows a quantitative assessment of the errors and enables a rigorous\ntesting of the significance of relationships between various curve parameters,\nregardless of whether their uncertainties are correlated. Analysis of the\ncurves gives the following results: (1) In accord with our previous findings,\nthe central position of the 2175 A extinction bump is mildly variable, its\nwidth is highly variable, and the two variations are unrelated. (2) Strong\ncorrelations are found among some extinction properties within the UV region,\nand within the IR region. (3) With the exception of a few curves with extreme\n(i.e., large) values of R(V), the UV and IR portions of Galactic extinction\ncurves are not correlated with each other. (4) The large sightline-to-sightline\nvariation seen in our sample implies that any average Galactic extinction curve\nwill always reflect the biases of its parent sample. (5) The use of an average\ncurve to deredden a spectral energy distribution (SED) will result in\nsignificant errors, and a realistic error budget for the dereddened SED must\ninclude the observed variance of Galactic curves.

{"text":"  Using the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RossiXTE), astronomers have discovered\nthat disk-accreting neutron stars with weak magnetic fields produce three\ndistinct types of high-frequency X-ray oscillations.

These oscillations can\ntherefore be used to explore fundamental physics, such as strong-field gravity\nand the properties of matter under extreme conditions, and important\nastrophysical questions, such as the formation and evolution of millisecond\npulsars. Observations using RossiXTE have shown that some two dozen neutron\nstars in low-mass X-ray binary systems have the spin rates and magnetic fields\nrequired to become millisecond radio-emitting pulsars when accretion ceases,\nbut that few have spin rates above about 600 Hz. The properties of these stars\nshow that the paucity of spin rates greater than 600 Hz is due in part to the\nmagnetic braking component of the accretion torque and to the limited amount of\nangular momentum that can be accreted in such systems. Further study will show\nwhether braking by gravitational radiation is also a factor. Analysis of the\nkilohertz oscillations has provided the first evidence for the existence of the\ninnermost stable circular orbit around dense relativistic stars that is\npredicted by strong-field general relativity. It has also greatly narrowed the\npossible descriptions of ultradense matter.\n"}

In\nthis paper, while we will briefly describe the first and the second subjects,\nwe shall focus on the third subject, the secure classical communication via\nwire. This way of secure telecommunication utilizes the properties of\nJohnson(-like) noise and those of a simple Kirchhoff's loop.

{"text":"  (Abridged) Combining cosmic shear power spectra and cluster counts is\npowerful to improve cosmological parameter constraints and\/or test inherent\nsystematics. However they probe the same cosmic mass density field, if the two\nare drawn from the same survey region, and therefore the combination may be\nless powerful than first thought. We investigate the cross-covariance between\nthe cosmic shear power spectra and the cluster counts based on the halo model\napproach, where the cross-covariance arises from the three-point correlations\nof the underlying mass density field. Fully taking into account the\ncross-covariance as well as non-Gaussian errors on the lensing power spectrum\ncovariance, we find a significant cross-correlation between the lensing power\nspectrum signals at multipoles l~10^3 and the cluster counts containing halos\nwith masses M>10^{14}Msun. Including the cross-covariance for the combined\nmeasurement degrades and in some cases improves the total signal-to-noise\nratios up to plus or minus 20% relative to when the two are independent. For\ncosmological parameter determination, the cross-covariance has a smaller effect\nas a result of working in a multi-dimensional parameter space, implying that\nthe two observables can be considered independent to a good approximation. We\nalso discuss that cluster count experiments using lensing-selected mass peaks\ncould be more complementary to cosmic shear tomography than mass-selected\ncluster counts of the corresponding mass threshold. Using lensing selected\nclusters with a realistic usable detection threshold (S\/N~6 for a ground-based\nsurvey), the uncertainty on each dark energy parameter may be roughly halved by\nthe combined experiments, relative to using the power spectra alone.\n"}
{"text":"  We apply the technique of parameter-splitting to existing cosmological data\nsets, to check for a generic failure of dark energy models. Given a dark energy\nparameter, such as the energy density Omega_Lambda or equation of state w, we\nsplit it into two meta-parameters with one controlling geometrical distances,\nand the other controlling the growth of structure. Observational data spanning\nType Ia Supernovae, the cosmic microwave background (CMB), galaxy clustering,\nand weak gravitational lensing statistics are fit without requiring the two\nmeta-parameters to be equal. This technique checks for inconsistency between\ndifferent data sets, as well as for internal inconsistency within any one data\nset (e.g., CMB or lensing statistics) that is sensitive to both geometry and\ngrowth. We find that the cosmological constant model is consistent with current\ndata. Theories of modified gravity generally predict a relation between growth\nand geometry that is different from that of general relativity.\nParameter-splitting can be viewed as a crude way to parametrize the space of\nsuch theories. Our analysis of current data already appears to put sharp limits\non these theories: assuming a flat universe, current data constrain the\ndifference Omega_Lambda(geom) - Omega_Lambda(grow) to be -0.0044 +\/- 0.0058\n(68% C.L.); allowing the equation of state w to vary, the difference w(geom) -\nw(grow) is constrained to be 0.37 +\/- 0.37 (68% C.L.).

{"text":"  Cosmic shear constrains cosmology by exploiting the apparent alignments of\npairs of galaxies due to gravitational lensing by intervening mass clumps.\nHowever galaxies may become (intrinsically) aligned with each other, and with\nnearby mass clumps, during their formation. This effect needs to be\ndisentangled from the cosmic shear signal to place constraints on cosmology. We\nuse the linear intrinsic alignment model as a base and compare it to an\nalternative model and data. If intrinsic alignments are ignored then the dark\nenergy equation of state is biased by ~50 per cent. We examine how the number\nof tomographic redshift bins affects uncertainties on cosmological parameters\nand find that when intrinsic alignments are included two or more times as many\nbins are required to obtain 80 per cent of the available information. We\ninvestigate how the degradation in the dark energy figure of merit depends on\nthe photometric redshift scatter. Previous studies have shown that lensing does\nnot place stringent requirements on the photometric redshift uncertainty, so\nlong as the uncertainty is well known. However, if intrinsic alignments are\nincluded the requirements become a factor of three tighter. These results are\nquite insensitive to the fraction of catastrophic outliers, assuming that this\nfraction is well known. We show the effect of uncertainties in photometric\nredshift bias and scatter. Finally we quantify how priors on the intrinsic\nalignment model would improve dark energy constraints.\n"}
{"text":"  Binary microlensing light curves have a variety of morphologies. Many are\nindistinguishable from point lens light curves.

{"text":"  BACKGROUND: Many of the mutations accumulated by naturally evolving proteins\nare neutral in the sense that they do not significantly alter a protein's\nability to perform its primary biological function. However, new protein\nfunctions evolve when selection begins to favor other, \"promiscuous\" functions\nthat are incidental to a protein's biological role. If mutations that are\nneutral with respect to a protein's primary biological function cause\nsubstantial changes in promiscuous functions, these mutations could enable\nfuture functional evolution.\n  RESULTS: Here we investigate this possibility experimentally by examining how\ncytochrome P450 enzymes that have evolved neutrally with respect to activity on\na single substrate have changed in their abilities to catalyze reactions on\nfive other substrates. We find that the enzymes have sometimes changed as much\nas four-fold in the promiscuous activities. The changes in promiscuous\nactivities tend to increase with the number of mutations, and can be largely\nrationalized in terms of the chemical structures of the substrates. The\nactivities on chemically similar substrates tend to change in a coordinated\nfashion, potentially providing a route for systematically predicting the change\nin one function based on the measurement of several others.\n  CONCLUSIONS: Our work suggests that initially neutral genetic drift can lead\nto substantial changes in protein functions that are not currently under\nselection, in effect poising the proteins to more readily undergo functional\nevolution should selection \"ask new questions\" in the future.\n"}

The instrument for hard X-rays HXD\/PIN allows us a detection of the\nsource up to 50 keV.

The\nshape of the SED is similar to that of other Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars\n(FSRQs) with similar power, making this source an excellent candidate for the\ndetection in gamma-rays by GLAST. We model the SED with the synchrotron-Inverse\nCompton model usually applied to FSRQs, showing that the deficit of soft\nphotons can be naturally interpreted as due to an intrinsic curvature of the\nspectrum near the low energy end of the IC component rather than to intrinsic\nabsorption, although the latter possibility cannot be ruled out.

The present paper studies the asymptotic\nbehaviour of solutions of the zero-rest-mass scalar wave equation in such a\nmodified Schwarzschild space-time in a neighbourhood of spatial infinity. The\nanalysis is eventually reduced to finding solutions of an inhomogeneous\nEuler--Poisson--Darboux equation, where the parameter theta affects explicitly\nthe functional form of the source term. Interestingly, for finite values of\ntheta, there is full qualitative agreement with general relativity: the\nconformal singularity at spacelike infinity reduces in a considerable way the\ndifferentiability class of scalar fields at future null infinity. In the\nphysical space-time, this means that the scalar field has an asymptotic\nbehaviour with a fall-off going on rather more slowly than in flat space-time.\n"}
{"text":"  It is known that a macroscopic quantum superposition (MQS), when it is\nexposed to environment, decoheres at a rate scaling with the separation of its\ncomponent states in phase space. This is more or less consistent with the well\nknown proposition that a more macroscopic quantum state is reduced more quickly\nto a classical state in general. Effects of initial mixedness, however, on the\nsubsequent decoherence of MQSs have been less known. In this paper, we study\nthe evolution of a highly mixed MQS interacting with an environment, and\ncompare it with that of a pure MQS having the same size of the central distance\nbetween its component states. Although the decoherence develops more rapidly\nfor the mixed MQS in short times, its rate can be significantly suppressed\nafter a certain time and becomes smaller than the decoherence rate of its\ncorresponding pure MQS. In an optics experiment to generate a MQS, our result\nhas a practical implication that nonclassicality of a MQS can be still\nobservable in moderate times even though a large amount of noise is added to\nthe initial state.\n"}
{"text":"  We study the propagation of nucleons and nuclei in tissue-like media within a\nMonte Carlo Model for Heavy-ion Therapy (MCHIT) based on the GEANT4 toolkit\n(version 8.2).

Model predictions are\nvalidated with available experimental data obtained for water and PMMA phantoms\nirradiated by monoenergetic carbon-ion beams. The MCHIT model describes well\n(1) the depth-dose distributions in water and PMMA, (2) the doses measured for\nfragments of certain charge, (3) the distributions of positron emitting nuclear\nfragments produced by carbon-ion beams, and (4) the energy spectra of secondary\nneutrons measured at different angles to the beam direction. Radial dose\nprofiles for primary nuclei and for different projectile fragments are\ncalculated and discussed as possible input for evaluation of biological dose\ndistributions. It is shown that at the periphery of the transverse dose profile\nclose to the Bragg peak the dose from secondary nuclear fragments is comparable\nto the dose from primary nuclei.\n"}
{"text":"  Using the matrix product formalism, we define a multi-parameter family of\nspin models on one dimensional chains, with nearest and next-nearest neighbor\nanti-ferromagnetic interaction for which exact analytical expressions can be\nfound for its doubly degenerate ground states. The family of Hamiltonians which\nwe define, depend on 5 continuous parameters and the Majumdar-Ghosh model is a\nparticular point in this parameter space. Like the Majumdar-Ghosh model, the\ndoubly degenerate ground states of our models have a very simple structure,\nthey are the product of entangled states on adjacent sites. In each of these\nstates there is a non-zero staggered magnetization, which vanishes when we take\ntheir translation-invariant combination as the new ground states. At the\nMajumdar-Ghosh point, these entangled states become the spin-singlets\npertaining to this model. We will also calculate in closed form the two point\ncorrelation functions, both for finite size of the chain and in the\nthermodynamic limit.\n"}
{"text":"  Recent experiments on La$_2$CuO$_4$ suggest that indirect resonant inelastic\nX-ray scattering (RIXS) might provide a probe for transversal spin dynamics. We\npresent in detail a systematic expansion of the relevant magnetic RIXS cross\nsection by using the ultrashort core-hole lifetime (UCL) approximation. We\ncompute the scattering intensity and its momentum dependence in leading order\nof the UCL expansion. The scattering is due to two-magnon processes and is\ncalculated within a linear spin-wave expansion of the Heisenberg spin model for\nthis compound, including longer range and cyclic spin interactions. We observe\nthat the latter terms in the Hamiltonian enhance the first moment of the\nspectrum if they strengthen the antiferromagnetic ordering. The theoretical\nspectra agree very well with experimental data, including the observation that\nscattering intensity vanishes for the transferred momenta ${\\bf q} = (0,0)$ and\n${\\bf q} = (\\pi,\\pi)$. We show that at finite temperature there is an\nadditional single-magnon contribution to the scattering with a spectral weight\nproportional to $T^3$. We also compute the leading corrections to the UCL\napproximation and find them to be small, putting the UCL results on a solid\nbasis. All this univocally points to the conclusion that the observed low\ntemperature RIXS intensity in La$_2$CuO$_4$ is due to two-magnon scattering.\n"}
{"text":"  We consider the least angle regression and forward stagewise algorithms for\nsolving penalized least squares regression problems. In Efron, Hastie,\nJohnstone & Tibshirani (2004) it is proved that the least angle regression\nalgorithm, with a small modification, solves the lasso regression problem. Here\nwe give an analogous result for incremental forward stagewise regression,\nshowing that it solves a version of the lasso problem that enforces\nmonotonicity. One consequence of this is as follows: while lasso makes optimal\nprogress in terms of reducing the residual sum-of-squares per unit increase in\n$L_1$-norm of the coefficient $\\beta$, forward stage-wise is optimal per unit\n$L_1$ arc-length traveled along the coefficient path. We also study a condition\nunder which the coefficient paths of the lasso are monotone, and hence the\ndifferent algorithms coincide. Finally, we compare the lasso and forward\nstagewise procedures in a simulation study involving a large number of\ncorrelated predictors.\n"}
{"text":"  We propose a pairing-based method for cooling an atomic Fermi gas. A three\ncomponent (labels 1, 2, 3) mixture of Fermions is considered where the\ncomponents 1 and 2 interact and, for instance, form pairs whereas the component\n3 is in the normal state. For cooling, the components 2 and 3 are coupled by an\nelectromagnetic field. Since the quasiparticle distributions in the paired and\nin the normal states are different, the coupling leads to cooling of the normal\nstate even when initially $T_{paired}\\geq T_{normal}$ (notation $T_S\\geq T_N$).\nThe cooling efficiency is given by the pairing energy and by the linewidth of\nthe coupling field. No superfluidity is required: any type of pairing, or other\nphenomenon that produces a suitable spectral density, is sufficient. In\nprinciple, the paired state could be cooled as well but this requires\n$T_N<T_S$. The method has a conceptual analogy to cooling based on\nsuperconductor -- normal metal (SN) tunneling junctions. Main differences arise\nfrom the exact momentum conservation in the case of the field-matter coupling\nvs. non-conservation of momentum in the solid state tunneling process.\nMoreover, the role of processes that relax the energy conservation requirement\nin the tunneling, e.g. thermal fluctuations of an external reservoir, is now\nplayed by the linewidth of the field. The proposed method should be\nexperimentally feasible due to its close connection to RF-spectroscopy of\nultracold gases which is already in use.\n"}

By considering the direct spectrum, derived from irradiated model\natmospheres, we search for the absorption profile signature present in the\ncombined star and planet light. Since the planetary spectrum is separated from\nthe stellar spectrum at most phases, we apply a phase dependent orbital model\nand tomographic techniques to search for absorption signatures.\n  Because the absorption signature lies buried in the noise of a single\nexposure we apply a multiline deconvolution to the spectral lines available in\norder to boost the effective S\/N ratio of the data. The wavelength coverage of\n80 angstroms is expected to contain ~100 planetary lines, enabling a mean line\nwith S\/N ratio of ~800 to be achieved after deconvolution. We are nevertheless\nunable to detect the presence of the planet in the data and carry out further\nsimulations to show that broader wavelength coverage should enable a planet\nlike HD 75289b to be detected with 99.9 per cent (4 sigma) confidence.

{"text":"  The existence of a clumpy, large-scale filamentary structure is at the basis\nof the current paradigm of cosmic formation and evolution of clusters. The\nstar-formation history of galaxies falling into a cluster is altered as a\nresult of the environmental stresses. We investigate the relation between\nsubstructure and properties of the galaxy population in a 30'x30' region\ncentered on the massive merging cluster A2744 at z~0.3. Multi-object\nspectroscopy at low resolution and BVR photometry are used to detect the\npresence of substructure through a Dressler-Schectman analysis and the\nphotometric redshift technique, respectively.

Along these filaments, the\nblue-to-red galaxy number ratio increases together with the cluster-centric\ndistance but peaks slightly beyond the cluster virial radius. The filaments\nhost a population of bright, large (i.e. more luminous than R* for the main\nbody of the cluster and with angular sizes of 13-22 $h_{70}^{-1}$ kpc) blue\ngalaxies that is hardly found among galaxies lying in a neighbouring\nlow-density environment at the same redshift of the cluster.

{"text":"  We provide a new algorithm for the treatment of inverse problems which\ncombines the traditional SVD inversion with an appropriate thresholding\ntechnique in a well chosen new basis. Our goal is to devise an inversion\nprocedure which has the advantages of localization and multiscale analysis of\nwavelet representations without losing the stability and computability of the\nSVD decompositions. To this end we utilize the construction of localized frames\n(termed \"needlets\") built upon the SVD bases.

{"text":"  Gravitational waves (GWs) from the inspiral of a neutron star (NS) or\nstellar-mass black hole (BH) into an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) with\nmass between ~50 and ~350 solar masses may be detectable by the planned\nadvanced generation of ground-based GW interferometers. Such intermediate mass\nratio inspirals (IMRIs) are most likely to be found in globular clusters. We\nanalyze four possible IMRI formation mechanisms: (1) hardening of an NS-IMBH or\nBH-IMBH binary via three-body interactions, (2) hardening via Kozai resonance\nin a hierarchical triple system, (3) direct capture, and (4) inspiral of a\ncompact object from a tidally captured main-sequence star; we also discuss\ntidal effects when the inspiraling object is an NS. For each mechanism we\npredict the typical eccentricities of the resulting IMRIs. We find that IMRIs\nwill have largely circularized by the time they enter the sensitivity band of\nground-based detectors. Hardening of a binary via three-body interactions,\nwhich is likely to be the dominant mechanism for IMRI formation, yields\neccentricities under 10^-4 when the GW frequency reaches 10 Hz. Even among\nIMRIs formed via direct captures, which can have the highest eccentricities,\naround 90% will circularize to eccentricities under 0.1 before the GW frequency\nreaches 10 Hz. We estimate the rate of IMRI coalescences in globular clusters\nand the sensitivity of a network of three Advanced LIGO detectors to the\nresulting GWs. We show that this detector network may see up to tens of IMRIs\nper year, although rates of one to a few per year may be more plausible. We\nalso estimate the loss in signal-to-noise ratio that will result from using\ncircular IMRI templates for data analysis and find that, for the eccentricities\nwe expect, this loss is negligible.\n"}

{"text":"  Short time-scale radio variations of compact extragalactic radio quasars and\nblazars known as IntraDay Variability (IDV) can be explained in at least some\nsources as a propagation effect; the variations are interpreted as\nscintillation of radio waves in the turbulent interstellar medium of the Milky\nWay. One of the most convincing observational arguments in favor of a\npropagation-induced variability scenario is the observed annual modulation in\nthe characteristic time scale of the variation due to the Earth's orbital\nmotion. So far there are only two sources known with a well-constrained\nseasonal cycle. Annual modulation has been proposed for a few other less\nwell-documented objects. However, for some other IDV sources source-intrinsic\nstructural variations which cause drastic changes in the variability time scale\nwere also suggested.

{"text":"  We explore the thermodynamic and global structural properties of a local\npatch of an accretion disk whose parameters were chosen so that radiation\npressure and gas pressure would be comparable in magnitude. Heating, radiative\ntransport, and cooling are computed self-consistently with the structure by\nsolving the equations of radiation MHD in the shearing-box approximation. Using\na fully 3-d and energy-conserving code, we compute the structure and energy\nbalance of this disk segment over a span of more than forty cooling times. As\nis also true when gas pressure dominates, the disk's upper atmosphere is\nmagnetically-supported. However, unlike the gas-dominated case, no steady-state\nis reached; instead, the total (i.e., radiation plus gas) energy content\nfluctuates by factors of 3--4 over timescales of several tens of orbits, with\nno secular trend. Because the radiation pressure varies much more than the gas\npressure, the ratio of radiation pressure to gas pressure varies over the\napproximate range 0.5--2. The volume-integrated dissipation rate generally\nincreases with increasing total energy, but the mean trend is somewhat slower\nthan linear, and the instantaneous dissipation rate is often a factor of two\nlarger or smaller than the mean for that total energy level. Locally, the\ndissipation rate per unit volume scales approximately in proportion to the\ncurrent density; the time-average dissipation rate per unit mass is\nproportional to m^{-1\/2}, where m is the horizontally-averaged mass column\ndensity to the nearer of the top or bottom surface.

{"text":"  The crossover between an impurity band (IB) and a valence band (VB) regime as\na function of the magnetic impurity concentration in models for diluted\nmagnetic semiconductors (DMS) is studied systematically by taking into\nconsideration the Coulomb attraction between the carriers and the magnetic\nimpurities. The density of states and the ferromagnetic transition temperature\nof a Spin-Fermion model applied to DMS are evaluated using Dynamical Mean-Field\nTheory (DMFT) and Monte Carlo (MC) calculations. It is shown that the addition\nof a square-well-like attractive potential can generate an IB at small enough\nMn doping $x$ for values of the $p-d$ exchange $J$ that are not strong enough\nto generate one by themselves. We observe that the IB merges with the VB when\n$x >= x_c$ where $x_c$ is a function of $J$ and the Coulomb attraction strength\n$V$. Using MC calculations, we demonstrate that the range of the Coulomb\nattraction plays an important role. While the on-site attraction, that has been\nused in previous numerical simulations, effectively renormalizes $J$ for all\nvalues of $x$, an unphysical result, a nearest-neighbor range attraction\nrenormalizes $J$ only at very low dopings, i.e., until the bound holes wave\nfunctions start to overlap.

We\ndefine a topology on the space of all submodules of V of a fixed finite\ncodimension d. Its main property is that it is compact Hausdorff and, in the\ncase of ideals in the ring itself, it contains as a subspace the configuration\nspace of d distinct unordered points in M and therefore gives a\n\"compactification\" of this configuration space. We present a concrete\ndescription of this space for low codimensions.\n  The main focus is then put on the second part which is concerned with a\ngeneralization of Vassiliev's h-principle.

In the special case of the\nfree lattice ($g=0$) the isospectral torus consists of just one point and we\nrecover the known result.\n  Both the solutions in the isospectral torus and the phase transition are\nexplicitly characterized in terms of Abelian integrals on the underlying\nhyperelliptic curve.\n  Our method relies on the equivalence of the inverse spectral problem to a\nmatrix Riemann--Hilbert problem defined on the hyperelliptic curve and\ngeneralizes the so-called nonlinear stationary phase\/steepest descent method\nfor Riemann--Hilbert problem deformations to Riemann surfaces.\n"}
{"text":"  We present a scaling law that predicts the values of the stresses obtained in\nnumerical simulations of saturated MRI-driven turbulence in non-stratified\nshearing boxes. It relates the turbulent stresses to the strength of the\nvertical magnetic field, the sound speed, the vertical size of the box, and the\nnumerical resolution and predicts accurately the results of 35 numerical\nsimulations performed for a wide variety of physical conditions. We use our\nresult to show that the saturated stresses in simulations with zero net\nmagnetic flux depend linearly on the numerical resolution and would become\nnegligible if the resolution were set equal to the natural dissipation scale in\nastrophysical disks. We conclude that, in order for MRI-driven turbulent\nangular momentum transport to be able to account for the large value of the\neffective alpha viscosity inferred observationally, the disk must be threaded\nby a significant vertical magnetic field and the turbulent magnetic energy must\nbe in near equipartition with the thermal energy.

{"text":"  The measurement of the scale of the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in the\ngalaxy power spectrum as a function of redshift is a promising method to\nconstrain the equation-of-state parameter of the dark energy w. To measure the\nscale of the BAO precisely, a substantial volume of space must be surveyed. We\ntest whether light-cone effects are important and whether the scaling relations\nused to compensate for an incorrect reference cosmology are in this case\nsufficiently accurate. We investigate the degeneracies in the cosmological\nparameters and the benefits of using the two-dimensional anisotropic power\nspectrum. Finally, we estimate the uncertainty with which w can be measured by\nproposed surveys at redshifts of about z=3 and z=1, respectively.\n  In the simulated survey we find that light-cone effects are small and that\nthe simple scaling relations used to correct for the cosmological distortion\nwork fairly well even for large survey volumes. The analysis of the\ntwo-dimensional anisotropic power spectra enables an independent determination\nto be made of the apparent scale of the BAO, perpendicular and parallel to the\nline of sight. This is essential for two-parameter w-models, such as the\nredshift-dependent dark energy model w=w_0+(1-a)w_a. Using Planck priors for\nthe matter and baryon density and Delta(H_0)=5% for the Hubble constant, we\nestimate that the BAO measurements of future surveys around z=3 and z=1 will be\nable to constrain, independently of other cosmological probes, a constant w to\n~ 12% and ~ 11% (68% c.l.), respectively.\n"}

We discuss the issue of gauge invariance\nof effective actions in general and in particular when using background field\ngauge. Our prescription for the IR cutoff (as any such prescription) breaks the\ngauge symmetry. Using our prescription, we have explicitly computed, at one\nloop, many terms of the Wilsonian effective action for general gauge theories,\ninvolving bosonic and fermionic matter fields of arbitrary masses and in\narbitrary representations, exhibiting the non-gauge invariant (as well as the\ngauge invariant) terms. However, for supersymmetric gauge theories all\nnon-gauge invariant terms cancel within each supermultiplet. This is strong\nevidence that in supersymmetric gauge theories this indeed defines a Lorentz,\nsusy and gauge invariant Wilsonian effective action.

Symmetry breaking in two-component BEC solitons is\nstudied in cases of the attractive (AA) and repulsive (RR) nonlinearity in both\ntraps; the mixed situation, with repulsion in one trap and attraction in the\nother (RA), is considered too. In all the cases, stable asymmetric solitons are\nfound, bifurcating from symmetric or antisymmetric ones (and destabilizing\nthem), in the AA and RR systems, respectively. In either case, bi-stability is\npredicted, with a nonbifurcating stable branch, either antisymmetric or\nsymmetric, coexisting with asymmetric ones. Solitons destabilized by the\nbifurcation tend to rearrange themselves into their stable asymmetric\ncounterparts. The impact of a phase mismatch, between the OLs in the two cores\nis also studied.

By comparing the MLCS2k2 fits used in that study\nto the results from other light-curve fitters applied to the same data, we\ndemonstrate that this is related to the interpretation of SN color excesses\n(after correction for a light-curve shape-color relation) and the presence of a\ncolor gradient across the local sample. If the slope of the linear relation\n($\\beta$) between SN color excess and luminosity is fit empirically, then the\nbubble disappears.

Using such an implementation of the generalized Wiener-filter in\nthe novel ARGO-software package, the different numerical schemes are\nbenchmarked with 1-, 2-, and 3-dimensional problems including structured white\nand Poissonian noise, data windowing and blurring effects. A novel numerical\nKrylov scheme is shown to be superior in terms of performance and fidelity.\nThese fast inverse methods ultimately will enable the application of sampling\ntechniques to explore complex joint posterior distributions. We outline how the\nspace of the dark-matter density field, the peculiar velocity field, and the\npower spectrum can jointly be investigated by a Gibbs-sampling process. Such a\nmethod can be applied for the redshift distortions correction of the observed\ngalaxies and for time-reversal reconstructions of the initial density field.\n"}
{"text":"  For Wireless Personal Area Network (WPAN) systems, resource allocation\nbetween several users within a piconet and the coexistence of several piconets\nare very important points to take into consideration for the optimization of\nhigh data rate Ultra Wide Band (UWB) systems. To improve the performance of the\nMulti-Band OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplex) solution proposed by\nthe Multi-Band OFDM Alliance (MBOA), the addition of a spreading component in\nthe frequency domain is a good solution since it makes resource allocation\neasier and also offers better robustness against channel frequency selectivity\nand narrowband interference. The Spread Spectrum - Multi-Carrier - Multiple\nAccess (SS-MC-MA) system proposed in this article offers not only the\nadvantages of Multi-Carrier - Coded Division Multiple Access (MC-CDMA) brought\nby frequency spreading, but also a more effective dynamic resource allocation\nin a multi-user and multi-piconet context. These improvements are obtained\nwithout increasing the complexity of the radio-frequency part compared to the\nclassical MBOA solution.\n"}
{"text":"  Low energy supersymmetric models provide a solution to the hierarchy problem\nand also have the necessary ingredients to solve two of the most outstanding\nissues in cosmology: the origin of dark matter and baryonic matter. One of the\nmost attractive features of this framework is that the relevant physical\nprocesses are related to interactions at the weak scale and therefore may be\ntested in collider experiments in the near future. This is true for the Minimal\nSupersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) as well as for its extension with the\naddition of one singlet chiral superfield, the so-called nMSSM. It has been\nrecently shown that within the nMSSM an elegant solution to both the problem of\nbaryogenesis and dark matter may be found, that relies mostly on the mixing of\nthe singlet sector with the Higgs sector of the theory. In this work we review\nthe nMSSM model constraints from cosmology and present the associated collider\nphenomenology at the LHC and the ILC. We show that the ILC will efficiently\nprobe the neutralino, chargino and Higgs sectors, allowing to confront\ncosmological observations with computations based on collider measurements. We\nalso investigate the prospects for a direct detection of dark matter and the\nconstraints imposed by the current bounds of the electron electric dipole\nmoment in this model.\n"}

The combination of all available data in the linear regime\nprefers, in the context of a ``vanilla+N_eff'' cosmological model,\n1.1<N_eff<4.8 (95% C.L.) with a best-fit value of 2.6.

Inclusion of the Lyman-alpha data shifts the preferred\nN_eff upwards because the sigma_8 value derived from the SDSS Lyman-alpha data\nis inconsistent with that inferred from CMB. In an extended cosmological model\nthat includes a nonzero mass for N_eff neutrino flavours, a running scalar\nspectral index and a w parameter for the dark energy, we find 0.8<N_eff<6.1\n(95% C.L.) with 3.0 as the best fit.\n"}

We developed\nfurther the hypothesis that such pairs appear, because the fluxer on the\nnucleus of the more distant galaxy passes through halo globular clusters of the\nnearer galaxy,resulting in magnification and splitting of the image of the\nsource that we interpret as a quasar. To corroborate this hypothesis, we\nanalyzed the distribution of quasars in the plane of the halos of these\ngalaxies. The quasars from close pairs were found to follow the density profile\nof globular clusters in the halos of elliptical and spiral galaxies with slopes\nof -1.5 and -2.4 for elliptical and spiral galaxies, respectively.

The\nabsence of Balmer emission lines and of photospheric HeI4471 absorption\nindicates that the accreted material is depleted in volatile elements and, by\nanalogy with SDSS1228+1040, may be the result of the tidal disruption of an\nasteroid.

{"text":"  We investigate in isothermal MHD simulations the instability of toroidal\nmagnetic fields resulting by the action of z-dependent differential rotation on\na given axial field B^0 in a cylindrical enclosure where in particular the\nhelicity of the resulting nonaxisymmetric flow is of interest.

Such optimization methods\nundoubtedly improve the performances of OODBs. Yet, they also always induce\nsome kind of overhead for the system.

To validate VOODB,\nperformance results obtained by simulation for a given experiment have been\ncompared to the results obtained by benchmarking the real systems in the same\nconditions.

{"text":"  We present the observations of a weak MgII absorption system detected at\nz~0.452 in the UVES high resolution spectrum of the QSO HE0001-2340. The weaker\nof the two MgII components forming the system shows associated absorptions due\nto SiI, CaI and FeI observed for the first time in a QSO spectrum. We\ninvestigate the nature of this absorber by comparing its properties with those\nof different classes of absorbers (weak MgII, Damped Ly-alpha systems and local\ninterstellar clouds) and reproducing its ionization conditions with\nphotoionization models. The observed absorber belongs to the class of weak MgII\nsystems on the basis of its equivalent width, however the relative strength of\ncommonly observed transitions deviates significantly from those of the above\nmentioned absorbers. A rough estimate of the probability to cross such a system\nwith a QSO line of sight is P~0.03. The presence of rare neutral transitions\nsuggests that the cloud is shielded by a large amount of neutral hydrogen. A\ndetailed comparison of the observed column densities with the average\nproperties of damped Ly-alpha systems and local interstellar cold clouds shows,\nin particular, deficient MgII\/MgI and CaII\/CaI ratios in our cloud. The results\nof photoionization models indicate that the cloud could be ionized by the UV\nbackground. However, a simple model of a single cloud with uniform density\ncannot reproduce the observed ionic abundance ratios, suggesting a more complex\ndensity structure for the absorber. Supposing that ionization corrections are\nnegligible, the most puzzling result is the underabundance of magnesium with\nrespect to iron which is hard to explain both with nucleosynthesis and with\ndifferential dust depletion.

It also predicts asymmetric distributions of\nretrograde versus prograde orbits. The time-delay induced by chaos on particle\ntransport through the Hill sphere is analogous to the formation of a resonance\nin a chemical reaction.

A diagram with the relative location of Fermi levels\nand gaps for several oxides is presented. The procedure discussed here is\ngeneric, allowing for the qualitative prediction of the charge flow direction\nat several oxide interfaces. The addition of electrons to antiferromagnetic Cu\noxides may lead to a superconducting state at the interface with minimal\nquenched disorder.

{"text":"  Plasmas in an accretion flow are heated by MHD turbulence generated through\nthe magneto-rotational instability. The viscous stress driving the accretion is\nintimately connected to the microscopic processes of turbulence dissipation. We\nshow that, in a few well-observed black hole accretion systems, there is\ncompelling observational evidence of efficient electron heating by turbulence\nor collective plasma effects in low accretion states, when Coulomb collisions\nare not efficient enough to establish a thermal equilibrium between electrons\nand ions at small radii. However, charged particles reach a thermal equilibrium\nwith their kind much faster than with others through Coulomb collisions, a\ntwo-temperature accretion flow is expected. We consider a Keplerian accretion\nflow with a constant mass accretion rate in the pseudo-Newtonian gravitational\npotential and take into account the bremsstrahlung, synchrotron, and inverse\nComptonization cooling processes. The critical mass accretion rate, below which\nthe two-temperature solution may exist, is determined by the cooling processes\nand the collisional energy exchanges between electrons and ions and has very\nweak dependence on the collision-less heating of electrons by turbulence, which\nbecomes more important at lower accretion rates. Collision-less heating of\nelectrons by MHD turbulence can no longer be ignored in quantitative\ninvestigations of these systems.\n"}
{"text":"  The reionization of the Universe has profound effects on the way galaxies\nform and on their observed properties at later times. Of particular importance\nis the relative timing of the reionization history of a region and its halo\nassembly history, which can affect the nature of the first stars formed in that\nregion, the properties and radial distribution of its stellar halo, globular\ncluster population and its satellite galaxies. We distinguish two basic cases\nfor the reionization of a halo - internal reionization, whereby the stars\nforming in situ reionize their host galaxy, and external reionization, whereby\nthe progenitor of a galaxy is reionized by external radiation before its own\nstars are able to form in sufficient numbers. We use a set of large-scale\nradiative transfer and structure formation simulations, based on cosmologies\nderived from both WMAP 1-year and WMAP 3-year data, to evaluate the mean\nreionization redshifts and the probability of internal\/external reionization\nfor Local Group-like systems, galaxies in the field and central cD galaxies in\nclusters. We find that these probabilities are strongly dependent on the\nunderlying cosmology and the efficiency of photon production, but also on the\nhalo mass. There is a rapid transition between predominantly external and\npredominantly internal reionization at a mass scale of 1.0e12 Msun\n(corresponding roughly to L*galaxies), with haloes less massive than this being\nreionized preferentially from distant sources. We provide a fit for the\nreionization redshift as a function of halo mass, which could be helpful to\nparameterize reionization in semi-analytical models of galaxy formation on\ncosmological scales. We find no statistical correlation between the\nreionization history of field galaxies and their environment.\n"}

For a few He-weak stars we also estimate the\neffective temperatures and the angular diameters by integrating absolute fluxes\nobserved over a wide spectral range. Non-LTE model calculations are carried out\nto study the influence of the He\/H abundance ratio on the emergent radiation of\nHe-strong stars and on their Teff determination. We find that the effective\ntemperatures, surface gravities and bolometric absolute magnitudes of He-weak\nstars estimated with the BCD system and the integrated flux method are in good\nagreement between each other, and they also agree with previous determinations\nbased on several different methods. The mean discrepancy between the visual\nabsolute magnitudes derived using the Hipparcos parallaxes and the BCD values\nis on average 0.3 mag for He-weak stars, while it is 0.5 mag for He-strong\nstars. For He-strong stars, we note that the BCD calibration, based on stars in\nthe solar environment, leads to overestimated values of Teff. By means of model\natmosphere calculations with enhanced He\/H abundance ratios we show that larger\nHe\/H ratios produce smaller BD which naturally explains the Teff\noverestimation.

The inner shock of this shell reaches\nand bounces off the center, leaving behind a central core with an initially\nalmost uniform density distribution, surrounded by an envelope consisting of\nthe material in the shock-bounded shell, with a power-law density profile that\nat late times approaches a logarithmic slope of -2 even in non-collapsing\ncases. The resulting density structure resembles a quiescent core of radius <\n0.1 pc, with a Bonnor-Ebert-like (BE-like) profile, although it has significant\ndynamical differences: it is initially non-self-gravitating and confined by the\nram pressure of the infalling material, and consequently, growing continuously\nin mass and size. With the appropriate parameters, the core mass eventually\nreaches an effective Jeans mass, at which time the core begins to collapse.\nThus, there is necessarily a time delay between the appearance of the core and\nthe onset of its collapse, but this is not due to the dissipation of its\ninternal turbulence as it is often believed.

Lattice information\nis provided by the graph mining algorithm gSpan; it contains all\nsupergraph-subgraph relations of the frequent subgraph patterns -- and their\nsupports.\n  Lattice2SAR is in particular used in the analysis of frequent graph patterns\nwhere the graphs are molecules and the frequent subgraphs are fragments. In the\nanalysis of fragments one is interested in the molecules where patterns occur.\nThis data can be very extensive and in this paper we focus on a technique of\nmaking it better available by using the lattice information in our clustering.\nNow we can reduce the number of times the highly compressed occurrence data\nneeds to be accessed by the user. The user does not have to browse all the\noccurrence data in search of patterns occurring in the same molecules. Instead\none can directly see which frequent subgraphs are of interest.\n"}
{"text":"  The recent PRB, henceforth referred as Ref.[1], experimentally resolves the\nintrinsic shape of the c-axis current-voltage characteristics (IVC) of HTSC and\ndemonstrates that at sufficiently high heat loads the heating-induced IVC\nnonlinearities exceed the intrinsic ones so radically that the latter might be\nsafely ignored.\n  The author of the comment fails to take account of the experimental findings\nby Ref.[1] and seeks to cast doubt on all its conclusions through reference to\na brush-like IVC, which is claimed to be free of heating. I will show that this\nclaim lacks substantiation; indeed it can be stated with certainty that the IVC\nis not free from heating. I will further show that the data selected for this\ncomment make it possible to explore for the first time the effect of\ntemperature on a range of loads where the genuine response is not hidden by\nheating and to demonstrate for the first time that $R(T)$ of the same sample is\nresponsible for a rich variety of IVC behaviours taken above and below $T_c$ at\nbath temperatures spanned over 180K. Thus these data in fact provide strong\nnovel evidence in favour of the major conclusions by Ref.[1], in particular the\nextrinsic cause of the key findings by intrinsic tunnelling spectroscopy.\n"}
{"text":"  We consider single-file diffusion in an open system with two species $A,B$ of\nparticles. At the boundaries we assume different reservoir densities which\ndrive the system into a non-equilibrium steady state. As a model we use an\none-dimensional two-component simple symmetric exclusion process with two\ndifferent hopping rates $D_A,D_B$ and open boundaries. For investigating the\ndynamics in the hydrodynamic limit we derive a system of coupled non-linear\ndiffusion equations for the coarse-grained particle densities. The relaxation\nof the initial density profile is analyzed by numerical integration. Exact\nanalytical expressions are obtained for the self-diffusion coefficients, which\nturns out to be length-dependent, and for the stationary solution. In the\nsteady state we find a discontinuous boundary-induced phase transition as the\ntotal exterior density gradient between the system boundaries is varied. At one\nboundary a boundary layer develops inside which the current flows against the\nlocal density gradient. Generically the width of the boundary layer and the\nbulk density profiles do not depend on the two hopping rates. At the phase\ntransition line, however, the individual density profiles depend strongly on\nthe ratio $D_A\/D_B$. Dynamic Monte Carlo simulation confirm our theoretical\npredictions.\n"}
{"text":"  Recently [J. Haro and E. Elizalde, Phys. Rev.

Here we\npresent the complete calculation providing precise details, in particular, of\nthe regularization procedure, which is decisive for the correct derivation of\nphysically meaningful quantities. A basic difference when comparing with the\nresults previously obtained by other authors is the fact that the motion force\nderived in our approach contains a reactive term --proportional to the mirrors'\nacceleration. This is of the essence in order to obtain particles with a\npositive energy all the time during the oscillation of the mirrors --while\nalways satisfying the energy conservation law. A careful analysis of the\ninterrelations among the different results previously obtained in the\nliterature is then carried out. For simplicity, the specific case of a neutral\nscalar field in one dimension, with one or two partially transmitting mirrors\n(a fundamental proviso for the regularization issue) is considered in more\ndetail, but our general method is shown to be generalizable, without essential\nproblems (Sect. 2 of this paper), to fields of any kind in two and higher\ndimensions.\n"}

{"text":"  The assessment of highly-risky situations at road intersections have been\nrecently revealed as an important research topic within the context of the\nautomotive industry. In this paper we shall introduce a novel approach to\ncompute risk functions by using a combination of a highly non-linear processing\nmodel in conjunction with a powerful information encoding procedure.\nSpecifically, the elements of information either static or dynamic that appear\nin a road intersection scene are encoded by using directed positional acyclic\nlabeled graphs. The risk assessment problem is then reformulated in terms of an\ninductive learning task carried out by a recursive neural network. Recursive\nneural networks are connectionist models capable of solving supervised and\nnon-supervised learning problems represented by directed ordered acyclic\ngraphs. The potential of this novel approach is demonstrated through well\npredefined scenarios. The major difference of our approach compared to others\nis expressed by the fact of learning the structure of the risk. Furthermore,\nthe combination of a rich information encoding procedure with a generalized\nmodel of dynamical recurrent networks permit us, as we shall demonstrate, a\nsophisticated processing of information that we believe as being a first step\nfor building future advanced intersection safety systems\n"}
{"text":"  We define Poincar\\'e series associated to a toric or analytically irreducible\nquasi-ordinary hypersurface singularity, (S,0), by a finite sequence of\nmonomial valuations, such that at least one of them is centered at the origin\n0.

{"text":"  The recent extension of the standard model to include massive neutrinos in\nthe framework of noncommutative geometry and the spectral action principle\ninvolves new scalar fields and their interactions with the usual complex scalar\ndoublet. After ensuring that they bring no unphysical consequences, we address\nthe question of how these fields affect the physics predicted in Weinberg-Salam\ntheory, particularly in the context of the Electroweak phase transition.\nApplying the Dolan-Jackiw procedure, we calculate the finite temperature\ncorrections, and find that the phase transition is first order. The new scalar\ninteractions significantly improve the stability of the Electroweak Z string,\nthrough the ``bag'' phenomenon described by Watkins and Vachaspati. (Recently\ncosmic strings have climbed back into interest due to new evidence). Sourced by\nstatic embedded strings, an internal space analogy of Cartan's torsion is\ndrawn, and a possible Higgs-force-like `gravitational' effect of this\nnon-propagating torsion on the fermion masses is described.

{"text":"  We use strongly coupled lattice QED with two flavors of massless staggered\nfermions to model the physics of pions in two-flavor massless QCD. Our model\nhas the right chiral symmetries and can be studied efficiently with cluster\nalgorithms. In particular we can tune the strength of the QCD anomaly and thus\nstudy its effects on the chiral phase transition. Our study confirms the widely\naccepted view point that the chiral phase transition is first order in the\nabsence of the anomaly. Turning on the anomaly weakens the transition and turns\nit second order at a critical anomaly strength. The anomaly strength at the\ntricritical point is characterized using $r = (M_{\\eta'}-M_{\\pi})\/\\rho_{\\eta'}$\nwhere $M_{\\eta'}, M_{\\pi}$ are the screening masses of the anomalous and\nregular pions and $\\rho_{\\eta'}$ is the mass-scale that governs the low energy\nfluctuations of the anomalous symmetry.

{"text":"  The differing M_bh-Luminosity relations presented in McLure & Dunlop, Marconi\n& Hunt and Erwin et al. have been investigated.

These adjustments result in relations which now\npredict similar black hole masses. The optimal K-band relation is\nlog(M_bh\/M_sun) = -0.37(+\/-0.04)[M_K +24] + 8.29(+\/-0.08), with a total (not\nintrinsic) scatter in log M_bh equal to 0.33 dex. This level of scatter is\nsimilar to the value of 0.34 dex from the M_bh-sigma relation of Tremaine et\nal. and compares favourably with the value of 0.31 dex from the M_bh-n relation\nof Graham & Driver.

{"text":"  We test the theory that lenticular (S0) galaxies form from spirals whose star\nformation has been shut down. We use the globular cluster specific frequency\nS_N, defined as the number of globular clusters normalised by the galaxy\nluminosity as a diagnostic. NTT\/EMMI long-slit spectroscopic observations of 11\nS0 galaxies at z < 0.006 are used to measure the absorption-line indices,\nHdelta, Hgamma, Mgb, Fe5270 and Fe5335 within the central r_e\/8. By inverting\nsingle-stellar population models, luminosity-weighted mean ages, metallicities\nand alpha-element abundance ratios are derived. We estimate the amount of\nfading a galaxy has undergone by comparing each galaxy's S_N with its deviation\nfrom the mean spiral S_N. Galaxies with higher S_N have older stellar\npopulations. Moreover, we find that the zero-point and amount of fading is\nconsistent with a scenario where lenticulars are formed by the quenching of\nstar formation in spiral galaxies. Our data also rule out any formation method\nfor S0s which creates a large number of new globular clusters. We confirm that\nprevious results showing a relationship between S_N and color are driven by the\nS_N - Age relation. Five galaxies show detectable Hbeta, [OIII], Halpha or\n[NII] emission lines. However, only in the two youngest galaxies is this\nemission unambiguously from star formation. Our results are consistent with the\ntheory that S0 galaxies are formed when gas in normal spirals is removed,\npossibly as a result of a change in environment. The on-going star formation in\nthe youngest galaxies hints that the timescale of quenching is ~< 1 Gyr. We\nspeculate, therefore, that the truncation of star formation is a rather gentle\nprocess unlikely to involve a rapid burst of star formation.\n"}
{"text":"  We present analysis of archival data from multiple XMM-Newton observations of\nthe Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 4151.

Radiative recombination continua\n(RRC) from oxygen and carbon are also detected. Our analysis suggests that the\nemission data are consistent with photoionization. Using the CLOUDY\nphotoionization code, we found that, while a two-component, high column density\nmodel (10e23 cm-2) with low covering factor proved adequate in reproducing all\ndetected Lyman series lines, it proved insufficient in modeling He-like\ntriplets observed (neon, oxygen, and nitrogen). If resonance line data were\nignored, the two-component model was sufficient to match flux from\nintercombination and forbidden lines. However, with the inclusion of resonance\nline data, He-like triplets could no longer be modeled with only two\ncomponents. We found that observed oxygen G and R ratios especially were\nanomalous in parameter space investigated.

We succeeded in modeling\nthe observed spectrum with the addition of a third, lower column density\n(10e20.5 cm-2) component with non-zero microturbulence and high covering\nfactor.

{"text":"  A spectral method is described for solving coupled elliptic problems on an\ninterior and an exterior domain.

This basis is used to\nconstruct the influence matrix which serves to transform the coupled boundary\nconditions into conditions on the interior problem. Chebyshev approximations\nare used to represent both the interior solutions and the boundary values. A\nstandard Chebyshev spectral method is used to calculate the interior solutions.\nThe exterior harmonic solutions are calculated as the convolution of the\nfree-space Green's function with a surface density; this surface density is\nitself the solution to an integral equation which has an analytic solution when\nthe boundary values are given as a Chebyshev expansion.

In\nthis paper we present new photometry at 16 microns and 22 micron from Spitzer\nInfrared Spectrograph (IRS) peak-up imaging of the Great Observatories Origins\nDeep Survey (GOODS) fields. We find that the spectral energy distribution shows\na factor of ~4 rise in flux density between the 16 micron and 22 micron\nbandpass which is most likely due to the entrance of polycyclic aromatic\nhydrocarbon emission features into the 22 micron and 24 micron passbands. The\nflux ratio between these bandpasses can be best fit by a z~1.7 luminous\ninfrared galaxy with a bolometric luminosity of (2-6)\\times10^{11} L_sun\ncorresponding to a star-formation rate of 80 M_sun\/yr. The predicted flux\ndensity values at other longer wavelengths are below the detection limits of\ncurrent instrumentation but such sources could potentially be detected in\nlensed submillimeter surveys. Re-evaluation of the optical\/near-infrared\nphotometry continues to favor z>6 photometric redshift solutions, but we argue\nthat the consistency of the multiwavelength parameters of this galaxy with\nother dusty starbursts favor the z~2 mid-infrared photometric redshift. The\ndata presented here provide evidence that optically undetected near-infrared\nsources which are detected at 24 microns are most likely dusty, starburst\ngalaxies at a redshift of z~2 with stellar masses >10^{10} M_sun.\n"}
{"text":"  Magnetic resonance imaging at ultra-low fields (ULF MRI) is a promising new\nimaging method that uses SQUID sensors to measure the spatially encoded\nprecession of pre-polarized nuclear spin populations at a microtesla-range\nmeasurement field. In this work, a seven-channel SQUID system designed for\nsimultaneous 3D ULF MRI and magnetoencephalography (MEG) is described. The\nsystem includes seven second-order SQUID gradiometers, characterized by\nmagnetic field resolutions of 1.2 - 2.8 fT\/rtHz. It is also equipped with five\nsets of coils for 3D Fourier imaging with pre-polarization. Essential technical\ndetails of the design are discussed.

{"text":"  In recent years, several authors have used probabilistic graphical models to\nlearn expression modules and their regulatory programs from gene expression\ndata. Here, we demonstrate the use of the synthetic data generator SynTReN for\nthe purpose of testing and comparing module network learning algorithms. We\nintroduce a software package for learning module networks, called LeMoNe, which\nincorporates a novel strategy for learning regulatory programs. Novelties\ninclude the use of a bottom-up Bayesian hierarchical clustering to construct\nthe regulatory programs, and the use of a conditional entropy measure to assign\nregulators to the regulation program nodes. Using SynTReN data, we test the\nperformance of LeMoNe in a completely controlled situation and assess the\neffect of the methodological changes we made with respect to an existing\nsoftware package, namely Genomica. Additionally, we assess the effect of\nvarious parameters, such as the size of the data set and the amount of noise,\non the inference performance. Overall, application of Genomica and LeMoNe to\nsimulated data sets gave comparable results. However, LeMoNe offers some\nadvantages, one of them being that the learning process is considerably faster\nfor larger data sets. Additionally, we show that the location of the regulators\nin the LeMoNe regulation programs and their conditional entropy may be used to\nprioritize regulators for functional validation, and that the combination of\nthe bottom-up clustering strategy with the conditional entropy-based assignment\nof regulators improves the handling of missing or hidden regulators.\n"}

The\nconcurrence of two qubit thermal entanglement and its dependence on anisotropic\nparameters, external magnetic field and temperature are studied in details. We\nfound that in all cases, inclusion of the DM interaction, which is responsible\nfor weak ferromagnetism in mainly antiferromagnetic crystals and spin\narrangement in low symmetry magnets, creates (when it does not exist) or\nstrengthens (when it exists) entanglement in $XYZ$ spin chain. This implies\nexistence of a relation between arrangement of spins and entanglement, in which\nthe DM coupling plays an essential role. It suggests also that anisotropic\nantisymmetric exchange interaction could be an efficient control parameter of\nentanglement in the general $XYZ$ case.\n"}

{"text":"  Gravitational lenses on galaxy scales are plausibly modelled as having\nellipsoidal symmetry and a universal dark matter density profile, with a Sersic\nprofile to describe the distribution of baryonic matter. Predicting all lensing\neffects requires knowledge of the total lens potential: in this work we give\nanalytic forms for that of the above hybrid model. Emphasising that complex\nlens potentials can be constructed from simpler components in linear\ncombination, we provide a recipe for attaining elliptical symmetry in either\nprojected mass or lens potential. We also provide analytic formulae for the\nlens potentials of Sersic profiles for integer and half-integer index. We then\npresent formulae describing the gravitational lensing effects due to\nsmoothly-truncated universal density profiles in cold dark matter model. For\nour isolated haloes the density profile falls off as radius to the minus fifth\nor seventh power beyond the tidal radius, functional forms that allow all\norders of lens potential derivatives to be calculated analytically, while\nensuring a non-divergent total mass. We show how the observables predicted by\nthis profile differ from that of the original infinite-mass NFW profile.\nExpressions for the gravitational flexion are highlighted. We show how\ndecreasing the tidal radius allows stripped haloes to be modelled, providing a\nframework for a fuller investigation of dark matter substructure in galaxies\nand clusters. Finally we remark on the need for finite mass halo profiles when\ndoing cosmological ray-tracing simulations, and the need for readily-calculable\nhigher order derivatives of the lens potential when studying catastrophes in\nstrong lenses.\n"}
{"text":"  We present 3 yr of timing observations for PSR J1453+1902, a 5.79-ms pulsar\ndiscovered during a 430-MHz drift-scan survey with the Arecibo telescope. Our\nobservations show that PSR J1453+1902 is solitary and has a proper motion of\n8(2) mas\/yr. At the nominal distance of 1.2 kpc estimated from the pulsar's\ndispersion measure, this corresponds to a transverse speed of 46(11) km\/s,\ntypical of the millisecond pulsar population. We analyse the current sample of\n55 millisecond pulsars in the Galactic disk and revisit the question of whether\nthe luminosities of isolated millisecond pulsars are different from their\nbinary counterparts. We demonstrate that the apparent differences in the\nluminosity distributions seen in samples selected from 430-MHz surveys can be\nexplained by small-number statistics and observational selection biases. An\nexamination of the sample from 1400-MHz surveys shows no differences in the\ndistributions. The simplest conclusion from the current data is that the spin,\nkinematic, spatial and luminosity distributions of isolated and binary\nmillisecond pulsars are consistent with a single homogeneous population.\n"}
{"text":"  This is a sequel to \\cite{li-qva1} and \\cite{li-qva2} in a series to study\nvertex algebra-like structures arising from various algebras such as quantum\naffine algebras and Yangians.

For each nonzero\ncomplex number $q$, we construct a quantum vertex algebra $V_{q}$ and prove\nthat every $DY_{q}(sl_{2})$-module is naturally a $V_{q}$-module. We also show\nthat $DY_{q}^{\\infty}(sl_{2})$-modules are what we call\n$V_{q}$-modules-at-infinity. To achieve this goal, we study what we call\n$\\S$-local subsets and quasi-local subsets of $\\Hom (W,W((x^{-1})))$ for any\nvector space $W$, and we prove that any $\\S$-local subset generates a (weak)\nquantum vertex algebra and that any quasi-local subset generates a vertex\nalgebra with $W$ as a (left) quasi module-at-infinity.

{"text":"  The network of resonant bar detectors of gravitational waves resumed\ncoordinated observations within the International Gravitational Event\nCollaboration (IGEC-2).

{"text":"  Dynamic properties of molecular motors that fuel their motion by actively\ninteracting with underlying molecular tracks are studied theoretically via\ndiscrete-state stochastic ``burnt-bridge'' models. The transport of the\nparticles is viewed as an effective diffusion along one-dimensional lattices\nwith periodically distributed weak links. When an unbiased random walker passes\nthe weak link it can be destroyed (``burned'') with probability p, providing a\nbias in the motion of the molecular motor. A new theoretical approach that\nallows one to calculate exactly all dynamic properties of motor proteins, such\nas velocity and dispersion, at general conditions is presented. It is found\nthat dispersion is a decreasing function of the concentration of bridges, while\nthe dependence of dispersion on the burning probability is more complex. Our\ncalculations also show a gap in dispersion for very low concentrations of weak\nlinks which indicates a dynamic phase transition between unbiased and biased\ndiffusion regimes. Theoretical findings are supported by Monte Carlo computer\nsimulations.\n"}

{"text":"  A comprehensive picture of high-mass star formation has remained elusive, in\npart because examples of high-mass YSOs tend to be relatively distant, deeply\nembedded, and confused with other emission sources. These factors have impeded\ndynamical investigations within tens of AU of high-mass YSOs--scales that are\ncritical for probing the interfaces where outflows from accretion disks are\nlaunched and collimated. Using observations of SiO masers obtained with the VLA\nand the VLBA, the KaLYPSO project is overcoming these limitations by mapping\nthe structure and dynamical\/temporal evolution of the material 10-1000 AU from\nthe nearest high-mass YSO: Radio Source I in the Orion BN\/KL region.

The motivation is that the natural frame for the theory of\nclassification of compact K\\\" ahler (and complex projective) manifolds includes\nat least the category of orbifolds, as shown in [Ca01] by the fonctorial\ndecomposition of {\\it special} manifolds as tower of orbifolds with either\n$\\kappa_+=-\\infty$ or $\\kappa=0$, and also, seemingly, by the minimal model\nprogram, in which most proofs work only after the adjunction of a \"boundary\".\n  Also, fibrations enjoy in the bimeromorphic category of geometric orbifolds\nextension properties not satisfied in the category of varieties without\norbifold structure, permitting to express invariants of the total space from\nthose of the generic fibre and of the base. For example, the natural sequence\nof fundamental groups is exact there; also the total space is special if so are\nthe generic fibre and the base. This makes this category suitable to lift\nproperties from orbifolds having either $\\kappa_+=-\\infty$ or $\\kappa=0$ to\nthose which are special.\n"}

This transmission is based on Slide-o-Cam, a\ncam mechanism with multiple rollers mounted on a common translating follower.\nThe design of Slide-o-Cam, a transmission intended to produce a sliding motion\nfrom a turning drive, or vice versa, was reported elsewhere. This transmission\nprovides pure-rolling motion, thereby reducing the friction of rack-and-pinions\nand linear drives. The pressure angle is a relevant performance index for this\ntransmission because it determines the amount of force transmitted to the load\nvs. that transmitted to the machine frame. To assess the transmission\ncapability of the mechanism, the Hertz formula is introduced to calculate the\nstresses on the rollers and on the cams.

{"text":"  There is currently much interest in the possible presence of\nintermediate-mass black holes in the cores of globular clusters. Based on\ntheoretical arguments and simulation results it has previously been suggested\nthat a large core radius -- or particularly a large ratio of the core radius to\nhalf-mass radius -- is a promising indicator for finding such a black hole in a\nstar cluster. In this study N-body models of 100000 stars with and without\nprimordial binaries are used to investigate the long-term structural evolution\nof star clusters. Importantly, the simulation data is analysed using the same\nprocesses by which structural parameters are extracted from observed star\nclusters. This gives a ratio of the core and half-mass (or half-light) radii\nthat is directly comparable to the Galactic globular cluster sample. As a\nresult, it is shown that the ratios observed for the bulk of this sample can be\nexplained without the need for an intermediate-mass black hole. Furthermore, it\nis possible that clusters with large core to half-light radius ratios harbour a\nblack-hole binary (comprised of stellar mass black holes) rather than a single\nmassive black hole. This work does not rule out the existence of\nintermediate-mass black holes in the cores of at least some star clusters.\n"}

We demonstrate that for\nHamiltonians containing straight-line librating orbits, the transcritical\nbifurcation of these orbits is the typical case which occurs also in the\nabsence of any discrete symmetries, while their isochronous pitchfork\nbifurcation is an exception. We determine the normal forms of both types of\nbifurcations and derive the uniform approximation required to include\ntranscritically bifurcating orbits in the semiclassical trace formula for the\ndensity of states of the quantum Hamiltonian.

{"text":"  Max-product belief propagation is a local, iterative algorithm to find the\nmode\/MAP estimate of a probability distribution.

Of these, even fewer provide exact ``necessary\nand sufficient'' characterizations.\n  In this paper we investigate the problem of using max-product to find the\nmaximum weight matching in an arbitrary graph with edge weights. This is done\nby first constructing a probability distribution whose mode corresponds to the\noptimal matching, and then running max-product. Weighted matching can also be\nposed as an integer program, for which there is an LP relaxation. This\nrelaxation is not always tight. In this paper we show that \\begin{enumerate}\n\\item If the LP relaxation is tight, then max-product always converges, and\nthat too to the correct answer. \\item If the LP relaxation is loose, then\nmax-product does not converge. \\end{enumerate} This provides an exact,\ndata-dependent characterization of max-product performance, and a precise\nconnection to LP relaxation, which is a well-studied optimization technique.\nAlso, since LP relaxation is known to be tight for bipartite graphs, our\nresults generalize other recent results on using max-product to find weighted\nmatchings in bipartite graphs.\n"}

Unfortunately, the emitted lines typically cover only a small\nfraction of the spectrometer's spectral range. Furthermore, their exact\nposition depends strongly on environmental conditions. A problem is the strong\nintensity variation between different (intensity ratios {>300). In addition,\nthe brightness of the lamps is insufficient to illuminate a spectrograph via an\nintegrating sphere, which in turn is important to calibrate a long-slit\nspectrograph, as this is the only way to assure a uniform illumination of the\nspectrograph pupil.\n  Laboratory precision laser spectroscopy has experienced a major advance with\nthe development of optical frequency combs generated by pulsed femto-second\nlasers.

{"text":"  The aim of this work is to develop a systematic manner to close\noverdetermined systems arising from conformal Killing tensors (CKT).

This method\ncan also be applied to other types of Killing equations, as well as to\noverdetermined systems constrained by some other conditions.\n  The major methodological apparatus of the research is a decomposition of the\nsection bundles where the covariant derivatives of the CKT land via generalized\ngradients. This decomposition generates a tree in which each row represents a\nhigher derivative. After using the conformal Killing equation, just a few\ncomponents (branches) survive, which means that most of them can be expressed\nin terms of lower order terms. This results in a finite number of independent\njets. Thus, any higher covariant derivative can be written in terms of these\njets.\n  The findings of this work are significant methodologically and, more\nspecifically, in the potential for the discovery of symmetries. First, this\nwork has uncovered a new method that could be used to close overdetermined\nsystems arising from conformal Killing tensors (CKT). Second, through an\napplication of this method, this research finds higher symmetry operators of\nfirst and second degree, which are known by other means, for the Laplace\noperator.

{"text":"  We present numerical simulations of stellar wind dynamics in the central\nparsec of the Galactic centre, studying in particular the accretion of gas on\nto Sgr A*, the super-massive black hole. Unlike our previous work, here we use\nstate-of-the-art observational data on orbits and wind properties of individual\nwind-producing stars. Since wind velocities were revised upwards and non-zero\neccentricities were considered, our new simulations show fewer clumps of cold\ngas and no conspicuous disc-like structure. The accretion rate is dominated by\na few close `slow wind stars' v_w < 750 km\/s, and is consistent with the Bondi\nestimate, but variable on time-scales of tens to hundreds of years. This\nvariability is due to the stochastic in-fall of cold clumps of gas, as in\nearlier simulations, and to the eccentric orbits of stars. The present models\nfail to explain the high luminosity of Sgr A* a few hundred years ago implied\nby Integral observations, but we argue that the accretion of a cold clump with\na small impact parameter could have caused it.

{"text":"  This paper is an investigation of the stability of some ideal stars.

An ideal star in our terminology has\nspherical symmetry and an isentropic equation of state. In our first work on\nthis subject it was assumed that the density vanishes beyond a finite distance\nfrom the origin. But it is difficult to decide what the proper boundary\nconditions should be and we are consequently skeptical of the concept of a\nfixed boundary. In this paper we investigate the double polytrope,\ncharacterized by a polytropic index n less than 5 in the bulk of the star and a\nvalue larger than 5 in an outer atmosphere that extends to infinity. It has no\nfixed boundary but a region of critical density where the polytropic index\nchanges from a value that is appropriate for the bulk of the star to a value\nthat provides a crude model for the atmosphere.

After the force is\nremoved, the system ages with time and its subsequent response time scales\nlinearly with its age (simple ageing), meaning that older systems are slower\nthan younger ones.

We also\nshow that chemical pollution of GC-forming GMCs by stellar winds from massive\nstars can result in star-to-star abundance inhomogeneities among light elements\n(e.g., C, N, and O) of stars in GCs. The present model with a canonical initial\nmass function (IMF) also shows a C-N anticorrelation that stars with smaller\n[C\/Fe] have larger [N\/Fe] in a GC. Although these results imply that\n``self-pollution'' of GC-forming GMCs by stellar winds from massive stars can\ncause abundance inhomogeneities of GCs, the present models with different\nparameters and canonical IMFs can not show N-rich stars with [N\/Fe] ~ 0.8\nobserved in some GCs (e.g., NGC 6752).

In particular, the physical anomalies of the sigma\nmodel can be reinterpreted as an obstruction to a global definition of the\nassociated sheaf of vertex superalgebras derived from the free conformal field\ntheory describing the model locally on $X$. In addition, one can also obtain a\nnovel understanding of the sigma model one-loop beta function solely in terms\nof holomorphic data.

{"text":"  We briefly review recent developments in black hole accretion disk theory,\nemphasizing the vital role played by magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) stresses in\ntransporting angular momentum.

This leads to an enhanced overall rate\nof angular momentum transport and allows accretion of matter to proceed at an\ninteresting rate. Furthermore, we argue that when vertical transport is\nimportant, the radial structure of the accretion disk is modified at small\nradii and this affects the disk emission spectrum. We present a simple model\ndemonstrating how energetic, magnetically-driven outflows modify the emergent\ndisk emission spectrum with respect to that predicted by standard accretion\ndisk theory.

These solvents are model systems commonly used to assess\nanesthetic potency. Picosecond time-scale molecular dynamics simulations have\nsuggested that protein dynamics or membrane dynamics play a role in the\nmolecular mechanism of anesthetic action. Ultrafast infrared spectroscopy with\n100 fs time resolution is an ideal tool to probe dynamics of anesthetic\nmolecules on such timescales. Pump-probe studies at the peak of the vibrational\nband yield a lifetime of $55 \\pm 1$ ps in olive oil and $52 \\pm 1 ps$ in\noctanol. The similarity of lifetimes suggests that energy relaxation of the\nanesthetic is determined primarily by the hydrophobic nature of the\nenvironment, consistent with models of anesthetic action. The results show that\nnitrous oxide is a good model system for probing anesthetic-solvent\ninteractions using nonlinear infrared spectroscopy.\n"}

{"text":"  Complex networks with expanding dimensions are studied, where the networks\nmay be directed and weighted, and network nodes are varying in discrete time in\nthe sense that some new nodes may be added and some old nodes may be removed\nfrom time to time. A model of such networks in computer data transmission is\ndiscussed. Each node on the network has fixed dimensionality, while the\ndimension of the whole network is defined by the total number of nodes. Based\non the spectacular properties of data transmission on computer networks, some\nnew concepts of stable and unstable networks differing from the classical\nLyapunov stability are defined. In particular, a special unstable network\nmodel, called devil network, is introduced and discussed. It is further found\nthat a variety of structures and connection weights affects the network\nstability substantially. Several criteria on stability, instability, and devil\nnetwork are established for a rather general class of networks, where some\nconditions are actually necessary and sufficient.

{"text":"  Random walks on expander graphs were thoroughly studied, with the important\nmotivation that, under some natural conditions, these walks mix quickly and\nprovide an efficient method of sampling the vertices of a graph. Alon,\nBenjamini, Lubetzky and Sodin studied non-backtracking random walks on regular\ngraphs, and showed that their mixing rate may be up to twice as fast as that of\nthe simple random walk. As an application, they showed that the maximal number\nof visits to a vertex, made by a non-backtracking random walk of length $n$ on\na high-girth $n$-vertex regular expander, is typically $(1+o(1))\\frac{\\log\nn}{\\log\\log n}$, as in the case of the balls and bins experiment. They further\nasked whether one can establish the precise distribution of the visits such a\nwalk makes.\n  In this work, we answer the above question by combining a generalized form of\nBrun's sieve with some extensions of the ideas in Alon et al. Let $N_t$ denote\nthe number of vertices visited precisely $t$ times by a non-backtracking random\nwalk of length $n$ on a regular $n$-vertex expander of fixed degree and girth\n$g$. We prove that if $g=\\omega(1)$, then for any fixed $t$, $N_t\/n$ is\ntypically $\\frac{1}{\\mathrm{e}t!}+o(1)$.

In particular, we obtain the above result\non the typical maximal number of visits to a single vertex, with an improved\nthreshold window.

{"text":"  Using scaled-particle theory for binary mixtures of two-dimensional hard\nparticles with rotational freedom, we analyse the stability of nematic phases\nand the demixing phase behaviour of a variety of mixtures, focussing on cases\nwhere at least one of the components consists of hard rectangles or hard\nsquares. A pure fluid of hard rectangles may exhibit, aside from the usual\nuniaxial nematic phase, an additional (tetratic) oriented phase, possessing two\ndirectors, which is the analogue of the biaxial or cubatic phases in three-\ndimensional fluids. There is computer simulation evidence that the tetratic\nphase might be stable with respect to phases with spatial order for rectangles\nwith low aspect ratios. As hard rectangles are mixed with other particles not\npossessing stable tetratic order by themselves, the tetratic phase is\ndestabilised, via a first- or second-order phase transition, to uniaxial\nnematic or isotropic phases; for hard rectangles of low aspect ratio tetratic\norder persists in a relatively large range of volume fractions. The order of\nthese transitions depends on the particle geometry, dimensions and\nthermodynamic conditions of the mixture. The second component of the mixture\nhas been chosen to be hard discs or disco-rectangles, the geometry of which is\ndifferent from that of rectangles, leading to packing frustration and demixing\nbehaviour, or simply rectangles of different aspect ratio. These mixtures may\nbe good candidates for observing thermodynamically stable tetratic phases in\nmonolayers of hard particles. Finally, demixing between fluid\n(isotropic--tetratic or tetratic--tetratic) phases is seen to occur in mixtures\nof hard squares of different sizes when the size ratio is sufficiently large.\n"}

{"text":"  Since the advent of chirped pulse amplification1 the peak power of lasers has\ngrown dramatically and opened the new branch of high field science, delivering\nthe focused irradiance, electric fields of which drive electrons into the\nrelativistic regime. In a plasma wake wave generated by such a laser,\nmodulations of the electron density naturally and robustly take the shape of\nparaboloidal dense shells, separated by evacuated regions, moving almost at the\nspeed of light. When we inject another counter-propagating laser pulse, it is\npartially reflected from the shells, acting as relativistic flying\n(semi-transparent) mirrors, producing an extremely time-compressed\nfrequency-multiplied pulse which may be focused tightly to the diffraction\nlimit. This is as if the counterstreaming laser pulse bounces off a\nrelativistically swung tennis racket, turning the ball of the laser photons\ninto another ball of coherent X-ray photons but with a form extremely\nrelativistically compressed to attosecond and zeptosecond levels. Here we\nreport the first demonstration of the frequency multiplication detected from\nthe reflection of a weak laser pulse in the region of the wake wave generated\nby the driver pulse in helium plasma. This leads to the possibility of very\nstrong pulse compression and extreme coherent light intensification. This\nRelativistic Tennis with photon beams is demonstrated leading to the\npossibility toward reaching enormous electromagnetic field intensification and\nfinally approaching the Schwinger field, toward which the vacuum nonlinearly\nwarps and eventually breaks, producing electron-positron pairs.\n"}
{"text":"  This paper shows how the exposure of the Moon to the Earth's plasmasheet is\nsubject to decadal variations due to lunar precession. The latter is a key\nproperty of the Moon's apparent orbit around the Earth - the nodes of that\norbit precess around the ecliptic, completing one revolution every 18.6 years.\nThis precession is responsible for a number of astronomical phenomena, e.g. the\nyear to year drift of solar and lunar eclipse periods. It also controls the\necliptic latitude at which the Moon crosses the magnetotail and thus the number\nand duration of lunar encounters with the plasmasheet. This paper presents a\ndetailed model of those encounters and applies it to the period 1960 to 2030.\nThis shows that the total lunar exposure to the plasmasheet will vary from 10\nhours per month at a minimum of the eighteen-year cycle rising to 40 hours per\nmonth at the maximum. These variations could have a profound impact on the\naccumulation of charge due plasmasheet electrons impacting the lunar surface.\nThus we should expect the level of lunar surface charging to vary over the\neighteen-year cycle. The literature contains reports that support this: several\nobservations made during the cycle maximum of 1994-2000 are attributed to\nbombardment and charging of the lunar surface by plasmasheet electrons. Thus we\nconclude that lunar surface charging will vary markedly over an eighteen-year\ncycle driven by lunar precession. It is important to interpret lunar\nenvironment measurements in the context of this cycle and to allow for the\ncycle when designing equipment for deployment on the lunar surface. This is\nparticularly important in respect of developing plans for robotic exploration\non the lunar surface during the next cycle maximum of 2012-19.\n"}

The growth rate depends strongly on loss cone opening angle, which\nmust be less than $90^{o}$ for significant CMI growth. The growth rate is\nsharply peaked for perpendicular radiation ($k_{\\parallel} = 0$), with a\nfull-width at half-maximum $1.7^{o}$, in good agreement with observed k-vector\norientations and numerical simulations. The fractional bandwidth varied between\n10$^{-4}$ and 10$^{-2}$, depending most strongly on propagation direction. This\nrange encompasses nearly all observed fractional AKR burst bandwidths.

The only computed LO mode growth rates compatible\nobserved LO mode radiation levels occurred for number densities more than 100\ntimes the average energetic electron densities measured in auroral cavities.\nThis implies that LO mode radiation is not produced directly by the CMI\nmechanism but more likely results from mode conversion of RX mode radiation. We\nfind that perturbation of the model velocity distribution by large ion solitary\nwaves (ion holes) can enhance the growth rate by a factor of 2-4.

Various\ninteractions are taken into account. We show that the current of the itinerant\nspins going through this system depends strongly on the magnetic ordering of\nthe multilayer: at temperatures $T$ below (above) the transition temperature\n$T_c$, a strong (weak) current is observed. This results in a strong jump of\nthe resistance across $T_c$. Moreover, we observe an anomalous variation,\nnamely a peak, of the spin current in the critical region just above $T_c$. We\nshow that this peak is due to the formation of domains in the temperature\nregion between the low-$T$ ordered phase and the true paramagnetic disordered\nphase. The existence of such domains is known in the theory of critical\nphenomena. The behavior of the resistance obtained here is compared to a recent\nexperiment.

An analytical expression for the crossover between attractive and\nrepulsive pressure is obtained as a function of the salt concentration. This\ncondition reduces to the high-salt limit of Parsegian and Gingell where the\ninteraction is exponentially screened and to the zero salt limit of Lau and\nPincus in which the important length scales are the inter-plate separation and\nthe Gouy-Chapman length. In the regime of low salt and high surface charges we\npredict - for any ratio of the charges on the surfaces - that the attractive\npressure is long-ranged as a function of the spacing. The attractive pressure\nis related to the decrease in counter-ion concentration as the inter-plate\ndistance is decreased.

This process is\ndual to the zero-range process (ZRP) in the sense that, while for the ZRP the\nrate of transfer of a particle only depends on the occupation of the departure\nsite, it only depends on the occupation of the arrival site for the target\nprocess. More precisely, duality associates to a given ZRP a unique target\nprocess, and vice-versa. If the dynamics is symmetric, i.e., in the absence of\na bias, both processes have the same stationary-state product measure. In this\nwork we focus our interest on the situation where the latter measure exhibits a\ncontinuous condensation transition at some finite critical density $\\rho_c$,\nirrespective of the dimensionality. The novelty comes from the case of\nasymmetric dynamics, where the target process has a nontrivial fluctuating\nstationary state, whose characteristics depend on the dimensionality.

The nucleus contributes little\nto the total 1.4 GHz radio power of NGC 5033 and, based on the radio to\nfar-infrared (FIR) relation, it appears that the radio and far-infrared\nemission from NGC 5033 are dominated by a starburst that during the last 10 Myr\nproduced stars at a rate of ~2.8 M_sun\/yr, yielding a supernova (type Ib\/c and\nII) rate of 0.045 #\/yr. This supernova rate corresponds to about 1 SN event\nevery 22 yr. Finally, from our deep 8.4 GHz VLA-D image, we suggest the\nexistence of a radio spur in NGC 5033, which could have been due to a hot\nsuperbubble formed as a consequence of sequential supernova explosions\noccurring during the lifetime of a giant molecular cloud.\n"}

Equality does not hold for all\nchannels. As a consequence, the attainability condition cannot be used to test\nfor optimal POVMs for all channels.

The study focuses on the most usual\ncase of parallel manipulators with only one inverse kinematic solution. The\nnotion of aspect introduced for serial manipulators in [Borrel 86] is redefined\nfor such parallel manipulators.

The resulting architecture\nis hybrid in that it has both serial and parallel links. Fully-parallel\nmanipulators are known for the existence of particularly undesirable\nsingularities (referred to as parallel singularities) where control is lost [4]\nand [6]. On the other hand, due to their cantilever type of kinematic\narrangement, fully serial manipulators suffer from a lack of stiffness and from\nrelatively large positioning errors. The hybrid manipulator studied is\nintrinsically stiffer and more accurate. Furthermore, since all actuators are\nlocated on the first axis, the inertial effects are considerably reduced.

{"text":"  The global colors of galaxies have recently been shown to follow bimodal\ndistributions. Galaxies separate into a ``red sequence'', populated\nprototypically by early-type galaxies, and a ``blue cloud'', whose typical\nobjects are late-type disk galaxies. Intermediate-type (Sa-Sbc) galaxies\npopulate both regions. It has been suggested that this bimodality reflects the\ntwo-component nature of disk-bulge galaxies. However, it has now been\nestablished that there are two types of bulges: ``classical bulges'' that are\ndynamically hot systems resembling (little) ellipticals, and ``pseudobulges'',\ndynamically cold, flattened, disk-like structures that could not have formed\nvia violent relaxation. Therefore thee question is whether at types Sa-Sbc,\nwhere both bulge types are found, the red-blue dichotomy separates galaxies at\nsome value of disk-to-bulge ratio, $B\/T$, or, whether it separates galaxies of\ndifferent bulge type, irrespective of their $B\/T$. We identify classical bulges\nand pseudobulges morphologically with HST images in a sample of nearby\ngalaxies. Detailed surface photometry reveals that: (1) The red -- blue\ndichotomy is a function of bulge type: at the same $B\/T$, pseudobulges are in\nglobally blue galaxies and classical bulges are in globally red galaxies. (2)\nBulge type also predicts where the galaxy lies in other (bimodal) global\nstructural parameters. (3) Hence, the red -- blue dichotomy is not due to\ndecreasing bulge prominence alone, and the bulge type of a galaxy carries\nsignificance for the galaxy's evolutionary history ... (Abridged)\n"}

This unique\nstellar system is both one of the oldest (8 Gyr) and most metal-rich ([Fe\/H] ~\n0.4) open clusters in our Galaxy, and has a color-magnitude diagram (CMD) that\nexhibits both a red giant clump and a much hotter extreme horizontal branch.\nFitting the Balmer lines of the white dwarfs in the cluster, using Keck\/LRIS\nspectra, suggests that most of these stars are undermassive, <M> = 0.43 +\/-\n0.06 Msun, and therefore could not have formed from canonical stellar evolution\ninvolving the helium flash at the tip of the red giant branch. We show that at\nleast 40% of NGC 6791's evolved stars must have lost enough mass on the red\ngiant branch to avoid the flash, and therefore did not convert helium into\ncarbon-oxygen in their core. Such increased mass loss in the evolution of the\nprogenitors of these stars is consistent with the presence of the extreme\nhorizontal branch in the CMD. This unique stellar evolutionary channel also\nnaturally explains the recent finding of a very young age (2.4 Gyr) for NGC\n6791 from white dwarf cooling theory; helium core white dwarfs in this cluster\nwill cool ~3 times slower than carbon-oxygen core stars and therefore the\ncorrected white dwarf cooling age is in fact ~7 Gyr, consistent with the well\nmeasured main-sequence turnoff age.

Timing using XMM and Chandra over a 2.4 yr span\nreveals no significant change in its spin period. The 2 sigma upper limit on\nthe period derivative leads, in the dipole spin-down formalism, to an energy\nloss rate E-dot < 7e33 ergs\/s, surface magnetic field strength B_p < 1.5e11 G,\nand characteristic age tau_c = P\/2P-dot > 8 Myr.

However, the X-ray luminosity of PSR J1852+0040, L(bol) ~\n3e33(d\/7.1 kpc)^2 ergs\/s is a large fraction of E-dot, which challenges the\nrotation-powered assumption. Instead, its high blackbody temperature,\n0.46+\/-0.04 keV, small blackbody radius ~ 0.8 km, and large pulsed fraction, ~\n80%, may be evidence of accretion onto a polar cap, possibly from a fallback\ndisk made of supernova debris. If B_p < 1e10 G, an accretion disk can penetrate\nthe light cylinder and interact with the magnetosphere while resulting torques\non the neutron star remain within the observed limits. A weak B-field is also\ninferred in another CCO, the 424-ms pulsar 1E 1207.4-5209, from its steady spin\nand soft X-ray absorption lines. We propose this origin of radio-quiet CCOs:\nthe B-field, derived from a turbulent dynamo, is weaker if the NS is formed\nspinning slowly, which enables it to accrete SN debris.

{"text":"  Light travel time delays distort the apparent shapes of HII regions\nsurrounding bright quasars during early stages of cosmic reionization.\nIndividual HII regions may remain undetectable in forthcoming redshifted 21 cm\nexperiments. However, the systematic deformation along the line of sight may be\ndetectable statistically, either by stacking tomographic 21cm images of quasars\nidentified, for example, by JWST, or as small-scale anisotropy in the\nthree-dimensional 21cm power spectrum. Here we consider the detectability of\nthis effect. The anisotropy is largest when HII regions are large and expand\nrapidly, and we find that if bright quasars contributed to the early stages of\nreionization, then they can produce significant anisotropy, on scales\ncomparable to the typical sizes of HII regions of the bright quasars (approx.\n30 Mpc and below). The effect therefore cannot be ignored when analyzing future\n21cm power spectra on small scales.

Each genus $g$ solution has only a\nsingle asymptotic $AdS_5 \\times S^5$ region, but exhibits $g$ homology\n3-spheres, and an extra $g$ homology 5-spheres, carrying respectively RR 3-form\nand RR 5-form charges. For genus 0, we recover $AdS_5 \\times S^5$ with 3 free\nparameters, while for genus $g \\geq 1$, the solution has $2g+5$ free\nparameters. The genus 1 case is studied in detail. Numerical analysis is used\nto show that the solutions are regular throughout the $g=1$ parameter space.\nCollapse of a branch cut on $\\Sigma$ subtending either a homology 3-sphere or a\nhomology 5-sphere is non-singular and yields the genus $g-1$ solution.

{"text":"  We examine the properties of a morphologically-selected sample of 0.4<z<1.0\nspheroidal galaxies in the GOODS fields in order to ascertain whether their\nincrease in abundance with time arises primarily from mergers. To address this\nquestion we determine scaling relations between the dynamical mass determined\nfrom stellar velocity dispersions, and the stellar mass determined from optical\nand infrared photometry. We exploit these relations across the larger sample\nfor which we have stellar masses in order to construct the first statistically\nrobust estimate of the evolving dynamical mass function over 0<z<1. The trends\nobserved match those seen in the stellar mass functions of Bundy et al. 2005\nregarding the top-down growth in the abundance of spheroidal galaxies. By\nreferencing our dynamical masses to the halo virial mass we compare the growth\nrate in the abundance of spheroidals to that predicted by the assembly of dark\nmatter halos. Our comparisons demonstrate that major mergers do not fully\naccount for the appearance of new spheroidals since z~1 and that additional\nmechanisms, such as morphological transformations, are required to drive the\nobserved evolution.\n"}
{"text":"  We report discovery of a compact object at high Galactic latitude.

Interpretation of 1RXS\nJ141256.0+792204 -- which we have dubbed Calvera -- as a typical X-ray-dim\nisolated neutron star would place it at z ~ 5.1 kpc above the Galactic disk --\nin the Galactic halo -- implying that it either has an extreme space velocity\n(v_z >~ 5100 km s-1) or has failed to cool according to theoretical\npredictions. Interpretations as a persistent anomalous X-ray pulsar, or a\n``compact central object'' present conflicts with these classes' typical\nproperties. We conclude the properties of Calvera are most consistent with\nthose of a nearby (80 to 260 pc) radio pulsar, similar to the radio millisecond\npulsars of 47 Tuc, with further observations required to confirm this\nclassification. If it is a millisecond pulsar, it has an X-ray flux equal to\nthe X-ray brightest millisecond pulsar (and so is tied for highest flux); is\nthe closest northern hemisphere millisecond pulsar; and is potentially the\nclosest known millisecond pulsar in the sky, making it an interesting target\nfor X-ray-study, a radio pulsar timing array, and LIGO.\n"}
{"text":"  Collaborative tagging has recently attracted the attention of both industry\nand academia due to the popularity of content-sharing systems such as\nCiteULike, del.icio.us, and Flickr.

Recent\nstudies, however, suggest that, as tagging communities grow, the added content\nand the metadata become harder to manage due to an ease in content diversity.\nThus, mechanisms that cope with increase of diversity are fundamental to\nimprove the scalability and usability of collaborative tagging systems.

We explore three main directions: First, we analyze\nthe tagging activity distribution across the user population. Second, we define\nnew metrics for similarity in user interest and use these metrics to uncover\nthe structure of the tagging communities we study. The structure we uncover\nsuggests a clear segmentation of interests into a large number of individuals\nwith unique preferences and a core set of users with interspersed interests.\nFinally, we offer preliminary results that demonstrate that the interest-based\nstructure of the tagging community can be used to facilitate content usage as\ncommunities scale.\n"}

For most of these afterglows, the X-ray spectral slope and the decay\nindices before and after the break can be accommodated by the standard jet\nmodel although a different origin of the breaks cannot be ruled out. In\naddition, there are 27 other afterglows whose X-ray light-curves may also\nexhibit a late break to a steep decay, but the evidence is not that compelling.\n  The X-ray emissions of 38 afterglows decay slower than t^{-1.5} until after 3\nday, half of them exhibiting such a slow decay until after 10 day.\n  Therefore, the fraction of well-monitored Swift afterglows with potential\njet-breaks is around 60 percent, whether we count only the strongest cases for\neach type or all of them. This fraction is comparable to the 75 percent of\npre-Swift afterglows whose optical light-curves displayed similar breaks at ~1\nday.\n  The properties of the prompt emission of Swift afterglows with light-curve\nbreaks show the same correlations (peak energy of GRB spectrum with the burst\nisotropic output and with burst collimated output) as previously found for\npre-Swift optical afterglows with light-curve breaks (the Amati and Ghirlanda\nrelations, respectively). However, we find that Ghirlanda relation is largely a\nconsequence of Amati's and that the use of the jet-break time leads to a\nstronger Ghirlanda correlation only when the few outliers to the Amati relation\nare included.\n"}

We introduce principal invariant\nsubspaces and prove that they are connected by an isometry that appears in the\npolar decomposition of the product of corresponding orthogonal projectors.\nPoint angles are defined by analogy with the point operator spectrum. We bound\nthe Hausdorff distance between the sets of the squared cosines of the angles\ncorresponding to the original subspaces and their perturbations. We show that\nthe squared cosines of the angles from one subspace to another can be\ninterpreted as Ritz values in the Rayleigh-Ritz method, where the former\nsubspace serves as a trial subspace and the orthogonal projector of the latter\nsubspace serves as an operator in the Rayleigh-Ritz method. The Hausdorff\ndistance between the Ritz values, corresponding to different trial subspaces,\nis shown to be bounded by a constant times the gap between the trial subspaces.\nWe prove a similar eigenvalue perturbation bound that involves the gap squared.\nFinally, we consider the classical alternating projectors method and propose\nits ultimate acceleration, using the conjugate gradient approach.

{"text":"  A mesh is a graph that divides physical space into regularly-shaped regions.\nMeshes computations form the basis of many applications, e.g. finite-element\nmethods, image rendering, and collision detection. In one important mesh\nprimitive, called a mesh update, each mesh vertex stores a value and repeatedly\nupdates this value based on the values stored in all neighboring vertices. The\nperformance of a mesh update depends on the layout of the mesh in memory.\n  This paper shows how to find a memory layout that guarantees that the mesh\nupdate has asymptotically optimal memory performance for any set of memory\nparameters. Such a memory layout is called cache-oblivious. Formally, for a\n$d$-dimensional mesh $G$, block size $B$, and cache size $M$ (where\n$M=\\Omega(B^d)$), the mesh update of $G$ uses $O(1+|G|\/B)$ memory transfers.\nThe paper also shows how the mesh-update performance degrades for smaller\ncaches, where $M=o(B^d)$.\n  The paper then gives two algorithms for finding cache-oblivious mesh layouts.\nThe first layout algorithm runs in time $O(|G|\\log^2|G|)$ both in expectation\nand with high probability on a RAM. It uses $O(1+|G|\\log^2(|G|\/M)\/B)$ memory\ntransfers in expectation and $O(1+(|G|\/B)(\\log^2(|G|\/M) + \\log|G|))$ memory\ntransfers with high probability in the cache-oblivious and disk-access machine\n(DAM) models.

{"text":"  Most industrial machine tools have a serial kinematic architecture, which\nmeans that each axis has to carry the following one, including its actuators\nand joints. High Speed Machining highlights some drawbacks of such\narchitectures: heavy moving parts require from the machine structure high\nstiffness to limit bending problems that lower the machine accuracy, and limit\nthe dynamic performances of the feed axes. That is why PKMs attract more and\nmore researchers and companies, because they are claimed to offer several\nadvantages over their serial counterparts, like high structural rigidity and\nhigh dynamic capacities. Indeed, the parallel kinematic arrangement of the\nlinks provides higher stiffness and lower moving masses that reduce inertia\neffects. Thus, PKMs have better dynamic performances. However, the design of a\nparallel kinematic machine tool (PKMT) is a hard task that requires further\nresearch studies before wide industrial use can be expected.

The spontaneous magnetization and the spin correlation\nfunctions of the simple orthorhombic Ising ferromagnet are derived explicitly.\nThe putative critical exponents derived explicitly for the simple orthorhombic\nIsing lattices are alpha = 0, beta = 3\/8, gamma = 5\/4, delta = 13\/3, eta = 1\/8\nand nu = 2\/3, showing the universality behavior and satisfying the scaling\nlaws.

{"text":"  Precise photometric measurements of the upcoming space missions allow the\nsize, mass, and density of satellites of exoplanets to be determined. Here we\npresent such an analysis using the photometric transit timing variation\n($TTV_p$). We examined the light curve effects of both the transiting planet\nand its satellite. We define the photometric central time of the transit that\nis equivalent to the transit of a fixed photocenter. This point orbits the\nbarycenter, and leads to the photometric transit timing variations. The exact\nvalue of $TTV_p$ depends on the ratio of the density, the mass, and the size of\nthe satellite and the planet. Since two of those parameters are independent, a\nreliable estimation of the density ratio leads to an estimation of the size and\nthe mass of the exomoon. Upper estimations of the parameters are possible in\nthe case when an upper limit of $TTV_p$ is known. In case the density ratio\ncannot be estimated reliably, we propose an approximation with assuming equal\ndensities. The presented photocenter $TTV_p$ analysis predicts the size of the\nsatellite better than the mass. We simulated transits of the Earth-Moon system\nin front of the Sun. The estimated size and mass of the Moon are 0.020\nEarth-mass and 0.274 Earth-size if equal densities are assumed. This result is\ncomparable to the real values within a factor of 2.

Our calculations based on the models\nfor jet precession and SMBHB evolution show that $dP_{\\rm pr} \/ dt$ can be as\nhigh as about $- 1.0$ with a typical value -0.2 and can be easily detected. We\ndiscussed the differential jet precession for NGC1275 observed in the\nliterature. If the observed rapid acceleration of jet precession is true, the\njet precession is due to the orbital motion of an unbound SMBHB with mass ratio\n$q\\approx 0.76$. When jets precessed from the ancient bubbles to the currently\nactive jets, the separation of SMBHB decrease from about $1.46 {\\rm Kpc}$ to\n$0.80 {\\rm Kpc}$ with an averaged decreasing velocity $da\/dt \\simeq - 1.54\n\\times 10^6 {\\rm cm\/s}$ and evolution timescale $\\tau_{\\rm a} \\approx 7.5\\times\n10^7 {\\rm yr}$. However, if we assume a steady jet precession for many cycles,\nthe observations implies a hard SMBHB with mass ratio $q\\approx 0.21$ and\nseparation $a\\approx 0.29 {\\rm pc}$.\n"}
{"text":"  Cell colonies of bacteria, tumour cells and fungi, under nutrient limited\ngrowth conditions, exhibit complex branched growth patterns. In order to\ninvestigate this phenomenon we present a simple hybrid cellular automaton model\nof cell colony growth. In the model the growth of the colony is limited by a\nnutrient that is consumed by the cells and which inhibits cell division if it\nfalls below a certain threshold. Using this model we have investigated how the\nnutrient consumption rate of the cells affects the growth dynamics of the\ncolony. We found that for low consumption rates the colony takes on a Eden-like\nmorphology, while for higher consumption rates the morphology of the colony is\nbranched with a fractal geometry. These findings are in agreement with previous\nresults, but the simplicity of the model presented here allows for a linear\nstability analysis of the system. By observing that the local growth of the\ncolony is proportional to the flux of the nutrient we derive an approximate\ndispersion relation for the growth of the colony interface. This dispersion\nrelation shows that the stability of the growth depends on how far the nutrient\npenetrates into the colony. For low nutrient consumption rates the penetration\ndistance is large, which stabilises the growth, while for high consumption\nrates the penetration distance is small, which leads to unstable branched\ngrowth. When the penetration distance vanishes the dispersion relation is\nreduced to the one describing Laplacian growth without ultra-violet\nregularisation. The dispersion relation was verified by measuring how the\naverage branch width depends on the consumption rate of the cells and shows\ngood agreement between theory and simulations.\n"}
{"text":"  We study the effects of different forms of information feedback associated\nwith mass media on an agent-agent based model of the dynamics of cultural\ndissemination. In addition to some processes previously considered, we also\nexamine a model of local mass media influence in cultural dynamics. Two\nmechanisms of information feedback are investigated: (i) direct mass media\ninfluence, where local or global mass media act as an additional element in the\nnetwork of interactions of each agent, and (ii) indirect mass media influence,\nwhere global media acts as a filter of the influence of the existing network of\ninteractions of each agent. Our results generalize previous findings showing\nthat cultural diversity builds-up by increasing the strength of the mass media\ninfluence. We find that this occurs independently of the mechanisms of action\n(direct or indirect) of the mass media message. However, through an analysis of\nthe full range of parameters measuring cultural diversity, we establish that\nthe enhancement of cultural diversity produced by interaction with mass media\nonly occurs for strong enough mass media messages. In comparison with previous\nstudies a main different result is that weak mass media messages, in\ncombination with agent-agent interaction, are efficient in producing cultural\nhomogeneity. Moreover, the homogenizing effect of weak mass media messages are\nmore efficient for direct local mass media messages than for global mass media\nmessages or indirect global mass media influences.\n"}
{"text":"  We present first results of our simulations of magnetic fields in the\nformation of single and binary stars using a recently developed method for\nincorporating Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) into the Smoothed Particle\nHydrodynamics (SPH) method. An overview of the method is presented before\ndiscussing the effect of magnetic fields on the formation of circumstellar\ndiscs around young stars. We find that the presence of magnetic fields during\nthe disc formation process can lead to significantly smaller and less massive\ndiscs which are much less prone to gravitational instability. Similarly in the\ncase of binary star formation we find that magnetic fields, overall, suppress\nfragmentation. However these effects are found to be largely driven by magnetic\npressure. The relative importance of magnetic tension is dependent on the\norientation of the field with respect to the rotation axis, but can, with the\nright orientation, lead to a dilution of the magnetic pressure-driven\nsuppression of fragmentation.\n"}
{"text":"  The emergence of magnetic flux from the convection zone into the corona is an\nimportant process for the dynamical evolution of the coronal magnetic field. In\nthis paper we extend our previous numerical investigations, by looking at the\nprocess of flux interaction as an initially twisted flux tube emerges into a\nplane parallel, coronal magnetic field. Significant differences are found in\nthe dynamical appearance and evolution of the emergence process depending on\nthe relative orientation between the rising flux system and any preexisting\ncoronal field. When the flux systems are nearly anti-parallel, the experiments\nshow substantial reconnection and demonstrate clear signatures of a high\ntemperature plasma located in the high velocity outflow regions extending from\nthe reconnection region. However, the cases that have a more parallel\norientation of the flux systems show very limited reconnection and none of the\nassociated features. Despite the very different amount of reconnection between\nthe two flux systems, it is found that the emerging flux that is still\nconnected to the original tube, reaches the same height as a function of time.\nAs a compensation for the loss of tube flux, a clear difference is found in the\nextent of the emerging loop in the direction perpendicular to the main axis of\nthe initial flux tube. Increasing amounts of magnetic reconnection decrease the\nvolume, which confines the remaining tube flux.\n"}
{"text":"  The power spectral density (PSD) function is commonly used to specify\nseismometer performance. It is derived from the FFT of acceleration and\ncorrection is made for the transfer function of the instrument that generated\nthe data. As with any such spectrum of density (`per Hz') type, the noise\ninherent to a PSD is large. This article illustrates the value of a function\nthat is derived from the PSD and for which the influence of noise is\nsignificantly reduced. Called the cumulative spectral power (CSP), it is\nobtained from the PSD through the noise-reducing process of integration. The\nmaximum of the CSP (corresponding to the longest graphed value of the period)\nprovides a means for estimating the total vibrational power of the earth.

{"text":"  The postburst object of a GRB is likely to be a highly magnetized, rapidly\nrotating compact object (e.g., a millisecond magnetar), which could produce an\nultrarelativistic electron-positron-pair wind. The interaction of such a wind\nwith an outwardly expanding fireball ejected during the burst leads to a\nrelativistic wind bubble (RWB). We numerically calculate the dynamics and\nradiative properties of RWBs and use this model to explain the shallow decay\nphase of the early X-ray afterglows observed by Swift. We find that RWBs can\nfall into two types: forward-shock-dominated and reverse-shock-dominated\nbubbles. Their radiation during a period of $\\sim 10^{2}-10^{5}$ seconds is\ndominated by the shocked medium and the shocked wind, respectively, based on\ndifferent magnetic energy fractions of the shocked materials. For both types,\nthe resulting light curves always have a shallow decay phase.

{"text":"  The monotonicity and stability of difference schemes for, in general,\nhyperbolic systems of conservation laws with source terms are studied. The\nbasic approach is to investigate the stability and monotonicity of a non-linear\nscheme in terms of its corresponding scheme in variations. Such an approach\nleads to application of the stability theory for linear equation systems to\nestablish stability of the corresponding non-linear scheme. The main\nmethodological innovation is the theorems establishing the notion that a\nnon-linear scheme is stable (and monotone) if the corresponding scheme in\nvariations is stable (and, respectively, monotone). Criteria are developed for\nmonotonicity and stability of difference schemes associated with the numerical\nanalysis of systems of partial differential equations. The theorem of\nFriedrichs (1954) is generalized to be applicable to variational schemes with\nnon-symmetric matrices. A new modification of the central Lax-Friedrichs (LxF)\nscheme is developed to be of the second order accuracy. A monotone piecewise\ncubic interpolation is used in the central schemes to give an accurate\napproximation for the model in question. The stability and monotonicity of the\nmodified scheme are investigated. Some versions of the modified scheme are\ntested on several conservation laws, and the scheme is found to be accurate and\nrobust.

{"text":"  We present a robust strategy to \\emph{veto} certain classes of instrumental\nglitches that appear at the output of interferometric gravitational-wave (GW)\ndetectors.This veto method is `physical' in the sense that, in order to veto a\nburst trigger, we make use of our knowledge of the coupling of different\ndetector subsystems to the main detector output. The main idea behind this\nmethod is that the noise in an instrumental channel X can be \\emph{transferred}\nto the detector output (channel H) using the \\emph{transfer function} from X to\nH, provided the noise coupling is \\emph{linear} and the transfer function is\n\\emph{unique}. If a non-stationarity in channel H is causally related to one in\nchannel X, the two have to be consistent with the transfer function. We\nformulate two methods for testing the consistency between the burst triggers in\nchannel X and channel H. One method makes use of the \\emph{null-stream}\nconstructed from channel H and the \\emph{transferred} channel X, and the second\ninvolves cross-correlating the two.

Using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, we apply this approach to\nboth the 3-year WMAP data and simulated future data. WMAP data constrain two\nprincipal components of the reionization history, approximately corresponding\nto the total optical depth and the difference between the contributions to the\noptical depth at high and low redshifts.

This agreement requires that the\ngalactic halo be of sufficient extent to maintain the galaxy at high curvature\nin the presence of the low-curvature cosmological background. If the galactic\nhalo and local environment in f(R) models do not have substantially deeper\npotentials than expected in LCDM, then cosmological field amplitudes |f_R| >\n10^{-6} will cause the galactic interior to evolve to low curvature during the\nacceleration epoch.

{"text":"  In wireless data networks, communication is particularly susceptible to\neavesdropping due to its broadcast nature. Security and privacy systems have\nbecome critical for wireless providers and enterprise networks. This paper\nconsiders the problem of secret communication over the Gaussian broadcast\nchannel, where a multi-antenna transmitter sends independent confidential\nmessages to two users with perfect secrecy. That is, each user would like to\nobtain its own message reliably and confidentially. First, a computable\nSato-type outer bound on the secrecy capacity region is provided for a\nmulti-antenna broadcast channel with confidential messages. Next, a dirty-paper\nsecure coding scheme and its simplified version are described. For each case,\nthe corresponding achievable rate region is derived under the perfect secrecy\nrequirement. Finally, two numerical examples demonstrate that the Sato-type\nouter bound is consistent with the boundary of the simplified dirty-paper\ncoding secrecy rate region.\n"}
{"text":"  The low energy electronic excitations in single layer and bilayer graphite\n(graphene) resemble quantum-relativistic particles also known as Dirac Fermions\n(DF). They possess an internal degree of freedom, chirality, that leads to\nunusual Landau Level (LL) energy sequences in a magnetic field and profoundly\nalters the magneto-transport properties. One of the consequences is an\nanomalous Quantum-Hall effect, recently detected in both single layer and\nbi-layer graphene. However the underlying cause, the unusual LL sequence, was\nnever observed. Here we report the direct observation of LL of DF by means of\nlow temperature Scanning-Tunnelling-Spectroscopy (STS) on the surface of\ngraphite in fields up to 12 Tesla. We find evidence of coexistence of massless\nand massive DF, and identify the zero-energy LL which is a unique consequence\nof their quantum-relativistic nature. Surprisingly these strictly\ntwo-dimensional properties emerge even on bulk graphite in samples where the\ninterlayer coupling is weak.\n"}

{"text":"  We present results from Spitzer Space Telescope observations of the\nmid-infrared phase variations of three short-period extrasolar planetary\nsystems: HD 209458, HD 179949 and 51 Peg. We gathered IRAC images in multiple\nwavebands at eight phases of each planet's orbit. We find the uncertainty in\nrelative photometry from one epoch to the next to be significantly larger than\nthe photon counting error at 3.6 micron and 4.5 micron. We are able to place\n2-sigma upper limits of only 2% on the phase variations at these wavelengths.\nAt 8 micron the epoch-to-epoch systematic uncertainty is comparable to the\nphoton counting noise and we detect a phase function for HD 179949 which is in\nphase with the planet's orbit and with a relative peak-to-trough amplitude of\n0.00141(33). Assuming that HD 179949b has a radius R_J < R_p < 1.2R_J, it must\nrecirculate less than 21% of incident stellar energy to its night side at the\n1-sigma level (where 50% signifies full recirculation). If the planet has a\nsmall Bond albedo, it must have a mass less than 2.4 M_J (1-sigma). We do not\ndetect phase variations for the other two systems but we do place the following\n2-sigma upper limits: 0.0007 for 51 Peg, and 0.0015 for HD 209458. Due to its\nedge-on configuration, the upper limit for HD 209458 translates, with\nappropriate assumptions about Bond albedo, into a lower limit on the\nrecirculation occuring in the planet's atmosphere. HD 209458b must recirculate\nat least 32% of incident stellar energy to its night side, at the 1-sigma\nlevel, which is consistent with other constraints on recirculation from the\ndepth of secondary eclipse depth at 8 micron and the low optical albedo. These\ndata indicate that different Hot Jupiter planets may experience different\nrecirculation efficiencies.\n"}

The wavelengths of the emission line components\nare consistent with their rest wavelengths as confirmed by measurements of\nnon-self absorbed He-like intersystem lines.

{"text":"  A cognitive radio can operate as a secondary system in a given spectrum. This\noperation should use limited power in order not to disturb the communication by\nprimary spectrum user.

{"text":"  OO Serpentis is a deeply embedded pre-main sequence star that went into\noutburst in 1995 and gradually faded afterwards.

OO Ser was monitored with the\nInfrared Space Observatory starting 4 months after peak brightness and covering\n20 months. In 2004-2006 we again observed OO Ser from the ground and\ncomplemented this dataset with archival Spitzer obsevations also from 2004. We\nanalysed these data with special attention to source confusion and constructed\nlight curves at 10 different wavelengths as well as spectral energy\ndistributions. The outburst caused brightening in the whole infrared regime.\nAccording to the infrared light curves, OO Ser started a wavelength-independent\nfading after peak brightness. Later the flux decay became slower but stayed\nwavelength-independent. The fading is still ongoing, and current fading rates\nindicate that OO Ser will not return to quiescent state before 2011. The\noutburst timescale of OO Ser seems to be shorter than that of FUors, but longer\nthan that of EXors. The outburst timescale and the moderate luminosity suggest\nthat OO Ser is different from both FUors and EXors, and shows similarities to\nthe recently erupted young star V1647 Ori. Based on its spectral energy\ndistribution and bolometric temperature, OO Ser seems to be an early class I\nobject, with an age of < 10^5 yr. The object is probably surrounded by an\naccretion disc and a dense envelope. Due to the shorter outburst timescales,\nthe viscosity in the circumstellar disc of OO Ser is probably an order of\nmagnitude higher than usual for FUors.\n"}

In our trilayers the magnetoresistance exhibits an increase of two\norders of magnitude when the superconducting state is reached: from the\nconventional normal-state values 0.6 % it goes up to 1000 % for temperatures\nbelow Tc. In contrast, in the bilayers the effect is only minor since from 3%\nin the normal state increases only to 70 % for temperatures below Tc.\nMagnetization data of both the longitudinal and transverse magnetic components\nare presented. Most importantly, we present data not only for the normal state\nof Nb but also in its superconducting state. Strikingly, these data show that\nbelow its Tc SC the Nb interlayer under the influence of the outer Ni80Fe20\nlayers attains a magnetization component transverse to the external field. By\ncomparing the transport and magnetization data we propose a candidate mechanism\nthat could motivate the pronounced magnetoresistance effect observed in the\ntrilayers. Adequate magnetostatic coupling of the outer Ni80Fe20 layers is\nmotivated by stray fields that emerge naturally in their whole surface due to\nthe multidomain magnetic structure that they attain near coercivity. Atomic\nforce microscopy is employed in order to examine the possibility that such\nmagnetostatic coupling could be promoted by interface roughness. Referring to\nthe bilayers, although out-of-plane rotation of the magnetization of the single\nNi80Fe20 layer is still observed, in these structures magnetostatic coupling\ndoes not occur due to the absence of a second Ni80Fe20 one so that the observed\nmagnetoresistance peaks are only modest.\n"}
{"text":"  [Abridged] We test the accuracy of different models of the attenuation of\nlight due to resonant scattering by intergalactic neutral hydrogen by comparing\ntheir predictions of the evolution of the mean cosmic flux decrement, D_A, to\nmeasurements of this quantity based on observations.

In order to perform the measurements of D_A, we fit a\npower-law to the continuum redward of the Lya emission line, and extrapolate\nthis fit to region blueward of it, where the flux is severely affected by\nabsorption due to intervening HI absorbers. We compute, using numerical\nsimulations, the redshift evolution of D_A accounting for the presence of Lya\nForest absorbers and Lyman limit systems randomly distributed along the\nline-of-sight, and compute its intrinsic scatter at the 1-, 2-, and 3-sigma\nlevel due to fluctuations in the absorber properties (column density, Doppler\nparameter, redshift) along different lines-of-sight. The numerical simulations\nconsist of Monte Carlo realizations of distributions of the absorber properties\nconstrained from observations. The results from the models considered here\nconfirm our theoretical expectation that the distribution of D_A at any given\nredshift be well described by a lognormal distribution function. This implies\nthat the effective optical depth, usually defined as the negative logarithm of\nthe average flux, 1 - D_A, is very accurately Gaussian distributed, in contrast\nto previous studies. This result is independent to the form of the input\ndistribution functions, and rather insensitive to the presence of high-column\ndensity absorbers, such as the Lyman limit systems.\n"}

We selected the sample from Chandra data for the\nwell studied region Chandra Deep Field South (CDFS) and chose the objects that\nalso have UV and IR data from GALEX and GOODS-Spitzer respectively.\n  Our main finding is that there is good agreement between the extinction\ncorrected SFR(UV) and the SFR(X), and we confirm the use of X-ray luminosities\nas a trustful tracer of recent star formation activity. Nevertheless, at\nSFR(UV) larger than about 5Msol\/year there are several galaxies with an excess\nof SFR(X) suggesting the presence of an obscured AGN not detected in the\noptical spectra. We conclude that the IR luminosity is driven by recent star\nformation even in those galaxies where the SFR(X) is an order of magnitude\nhigher than the SFR(UV) and therefore may harbour an AGN. One object shows\nSFR(X) much lower than expected based on the SFR(UV); this SFR(X) `deficit' may\nbe due to an early transient phase before most of the massive X-ray binaries\nwere formed. An X-ray deficit could be used to select extremely young bursts in\nan early phase just after the explosion of the first supernovae associated with\nmassive stars and before the onset of massive X-ray binaries.\n"}
{"text":"  The paper offers a discrete thermodynamic model of lasers. Laser is an open\nsystem; its equilibrium is based on a balance of two thermodynamic forces, one\nrelated to the incoming pumping power and another to the emitted light. The\nbasic expression for such equilibrium is a logistic map, graphical solutions to\nwhich are pitchfork bifurcation diagrams. As pumping force increases, the\nrelative populations on the ground and lasing branches tend to zero and unity\ncorrespondingly. An interesting feature of this model is the line spectrum of\nthe up and down transitions between the branches beyond bifurcation point. Even\nin a simple case of 2-level laser with only 2 possible transition types (up and\ndown), the spectra look like sets of the line packets, starting well before the\npopulation inversion. This effect is an independent confirmation of the\nEinstein's prohibition on practical realization of 2-level laser. Multilevel\nlasers may be approached by employing the idea of thermodynamic activity for\nthe emitting atoms. Considering coefficient of thermodynamic activity of the\nlasing level atoms to be proportional to the ratio of life times on the upper\nand lasing (the 3d) levels, one can derive a new basic map for the multilevel\nlaser system. For a modest ratio only of 0.01, spontaneous transitions between\nlevels are pushed to the area beyond population inversion, opening a space for\nthe functioning of laser.\n"}

The analysis of\nfrequency-rank distributions shows that the text sizes are enough to observe\nstatistical properties. The power-law character of these distributions (Zipf's\nlaw) holds in the region of rank variable r=20 - 3000 with an exponent\n$\\alpha\\simeq 1$.

Besides, an\napplicability of the Simon model to describe non-asymptotic properties of word\ndistributions is evaluated.\n  In describing language as a complex network, usually the words are associated\nwith nodes, whereas one may give different meanings to the network links. This\nresults in different network representations. In the second part of the paper,\nwe give different representations of the language network and perform\ncomparative analysis of their characteristics.

{"text":"  We study the growth of cosmological perturbations in the model of\nLorentz-violating massive gravity.

Apart from the standard contributions, the\nperturbations above the Friedmann background contain an extra piece which is\nproportional to an arbitrary function theta(x) of the space coordinates. This\nfunction appears as an integration constant and corresponds to a\nnon-propagating scalar mode which may, however, become dynamical with the\naccount of the higher-derivative corrections.

{"text":"  We present new multicolor photo-polarimetry of stars behind the Southern\nCoalsack. Analyzed together with multiband polarization data from the\nliterature, probing the Chamaeleon I, Musca, rho Opiuchus, R CrA and Taurus\nclouds, we show that the wavelength of maximum polarization (lambda_max) is\nlinearly correlated with the radiation environment of the grains. Using\nFar-Infrared emission data, we show that the large scatter seen in previous\nstudies of lambda_max as a function of A_V is primarily due to line of sight\neffects causing some A_V measurements to not be a good tracer of the extinction\n(radiation field strength) seen by the grains being probed. The derived slopes\nin lambda_max vs. A_V, for the individual clouds, are consistent with a common\nvalue, while the zero intercepts scale with the average values of the ratios of\ntotal-to-selective extinction (R_V) for the individual clouds. Within each\ncloud we do not find direct correlations between lambda_max and R_V. The\npositive slope in consistent with recent developments in theory and indicating\nalignment driven by the radiation field. The present data cannot conclusively\ndifferentiate between direct radiative torques and alignment driven by H_2\nformation. However, the small values of lambda_max(A_V=0), seen in several\nclouds, suggest a role for the latter, at least at the cloud surfaces. The\nscatter in the lambda_max vs. A_V relation is found to be associated with the\ncharacteristics of the embedded Young Stellar Objects (YSO) in the clouds. We\npropose that this is partially due to locally increased plasma damping of the\ngrain rotation caused by X-rays from the YSOs.\n"}

The quantity of chemicals that a cell\nproduces, as well as the differentiation value of the cell in the phenotype,\nare controlled by a Neural Network (the genotype) that takes as inputs the\nchemicals produced by the neighboring cells at the previous time step. In the\nproposed model, the number of iterations of the growth process is not\npre-determined, but emerges during evolution: only organisms for which the\ngrowth process stabilizes give a phenotype (the stable state), others are\ndeclared nonviable. The optimization of the controller is done using the NEAT\nalgorithm, that optimizes both the topology and the weights of the Neural\nNetworks. Though each cell only receives local information from its neighbors,\nthe experimental results of the proposed approach on the 'flags' problems (the\nphenotype must match a given 2D pattern) are almost as good as those of a\ndirect regression approach using the same model with global information.\nMoreover, the resulting multi-cellular organisms exhibit almost perfect\nself-healing characteristics.\n"}

The\nmodel predictions are calculated using two methods; the second-order\nperturbation theory and direct N-body simulations. These methods allow us to\nstudy non-linear evolution of large-scale structure.

The\nresulting constraints from power spectrum are consistent with those obtained in\nour earlier work, indicating the validity of the previous empirical modeling of\ngravitational nonlinearity in the modified Newtonian model. If linear biasing\nis adopted, the bispectrum of the SDSS galaxies yields constraints very similar\nto those from the power spectrum.

{"text":"  Diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) presents a compact framework to compare\nvarious MIMO systems and channels in terms of the two main advantages they\nprovide (i.e. high data rate and\/or low error rate). This tradeoff was\ncharacterized asymptotically (SNR-> infinity) for i.i.d. Rayleigh fading\nchannel by Zheng and Tse [1]. The asymptotic DMT overestimates the finite-SNR\none [2]. In this paper, using the recent results on the asymptotic (in the\nnumber of antennas) outage capacity distribution, we derive and analyze the\nfinite-SNR DMT for a broad class of channels (not necessarily Rayleigh fading).\nBased on this, we give the convergence conditions for the asymptotic DMT to be\napproached by the finite-SNR one. The multiplexing gain definition is shown to\naffect critically the convergence point: when the multiplexing gain is defined\nvia the mean (ergodic) capacity, the convergence takes place at realistic SNR\nvalues. Furthermore, in this case the diversity gain can also be used to\nestimate the outage probability with reasonable accuracy. The multiplexing gain\ndefinition via the high-SNR asymptote of the mean capacity (as in [1]) results\nin very slow convergence for moderate to large systems (as 1\/ln(SNR)^2) and,\nhence, the asymptotic DMT cannot be used at realistic SNR values.

The peak of the X-ray emission may be due to synchrotron or\ninverse-Compton emission. If synchrotron emission, the hotspot represents the\nsite of particle acceleration and the offset arises from either the jet\nexhibiting Scheuer's `dentist's drill' effect or a fast spine having less\nmomentum than the sheath surrounding it, which creates the radio hotspot.

High-SNR approximations for optimized average block and total\nerror rates are given. The SNR gain of optimization is rigorously defined and\nstudied using analytical tools, including lower and upper bounds, high and low\nSNR approximations.

Contrary to the case of BP decoding, under MS decoding the\nthresholds of the best degree distributions for standard irregular LDPC\nensembles are significantly bounded away from the Shannon threshold.

No significant spectral evolution is observed\nfrom this phase to the follow-up phase, and the follow-up phase is usually\nconsistent with the external shock models, implying that this segment likely\ndue to a refreshed external shock. Within this scenario, the data are generally\nconsistent with a roughly constant injection luminosity up to the end of this\nphase $t_b$. A positive correlation between E_{iso, X} and t_b also favors this\nscenario. Among the 13 bursts that have well-sampled optical light curves, 6\nhave an optical break around t_b and the breaks are consistent with being\nachromatic. However, the other 7 bursts either do not show an optical break or\nhave a break at a different epoch than t_b. This raises a concern to the energy\ninjection scenario, suggesting that the optical and X-ray emissions may not be\nthe same component at least for a fraction of bursts.

We summarize\nphenomenological models that can explain the very high state, with apparently\nhigher disk temperatures and lower inner-disk radii. Conversely, ultraluminous\nX-ray sources often contain cooler disks with large characteristic radii. We\nintroduce another phenomenological model for this accretion state.

We determine the dynamic scaling dimension of the AHR\nprocess from the time evolution of the two-point correlation functions, and\nfind numerically that the dynamic critical exponent is consistent with simple\nKardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) type scaling. We establish that this is the result of\nperfect screening of fluctuations in the stationary state. The two-point\ncorrelations decay exponentially in our simulations and in such a manner that\nin terms of quasi-particles, fluctuations fully screen each other at coarse\ngrained length scales. We prove this screening rigorously using the analytic\nmatrix product structure of the stationary state. The proof suggests the\nexistence of a topological invariant. The process remains in the KPZ\nuniversality class but only in the sense of a factorization, as $({KPZ})^2$.\nThe two Burgers equations decouple at large length scales due to the perfect\nscreening.\n"}

{"text":"  In the previous paper, based on the $SU(2)_{f}\\times SU(2)_{s}$ heavy quark\nsymmetries of the QCD Lagrangian in the heavy quark limit, the Bethe-Salpeter\nequation for the heavy baryon $\\Lambda_b$ was established with the picture that\n$\\Lambda_b$ is composed of a heavy quark and a scalar light diquark. In the\npresent work, we apply this model to calculate $\\mu_\\pi^2$ for $\\Lambda_b$, the\naverage kinetic energy of the heavy quark inside $\\Lambda_{b}$. This quantity\nis particularly interesting since it can be measured in experiments and since\nit contributes to the inclusive semileptonic decays of $\\Lambda_b$ when\ncontributions from higher order terms in $1\/M_b$ expansions are taken into\naccount and consequently influences the determination of the\nCabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix elements $V_{ub}$ and $V_{cb}$.

{"text":"  We give a quantitative analysis of the previously published nuclear magnetic\nresonance (NMR) experiments in the k-(ET)2X family of organic charge transfer\nsalts by using the phenomenological spin fluctuation model of Moriya, and\nMillis, Monien and Pines (M-MMP). For temperatures above T_nmr ~ 50 K, the\nmodel gives a good quantitative description of the data in the metallic phases\nof several k-(ET)2X materials. These materials display antiferromagnetic\ncorrelation lengths which increase with decreasing temperature and grow to\nseveral lattice constants by T_nmr. It is shown that the fact that the\ndimensionless Korringa ratio is much larger than unity is inconsistent with a\nbroad class of theoretical models (such as dynamical mean-field theory) which\nneglects spatial correlations and\/or vertex corrections. For materials close to\nthe Mott insulating phase the nuclear spin relaxation rate, the Knight shift\nand the Korringa ratio all decrease significantly with decreasing temperature\nbelow T_nmr. This cannot be described by the M-MMP model and the most natural\nexplanation is that a pseudogap, similar to that observed in the underdoped\ncuprate superconductors, opens up in the density of states below T_nmr. Such a\npseudogap has recently been predicted to occur in the dimerised organic charge\ntransfer salts materials by the resonating valence bond (RVB) theory. We\npropose specific new experiments on organic superconductors to elucidate these\nissues. For example, measurements to see if high magnetic fields or high\npressures can be used to close the pseudogap would be extremely valuable.\n"}

{"text":"  The resonant state of the open quantum system is studied from the viewpoint\nof the outgoing momentum flux. We show that the number of particles is\nconserved for a resonant state, if we use an expanding volume of integration in\norder to take account of the outgoing momentum flux; the number of particles\nwould decay exponentially in a fixed volume of integration. Moreover, we\nintroduce new numerical methods of treating the resonant state with the use of\nthe effective potential. We first give a numerical method of finding a\nresonance pole in the complex energy plane. The method seeks an energy\neigenvalue iteratively. We found that our method leads to a super-convergence,\nthe convergence exponential with respect to the iteration step. The present\nmethod is completely independent of commonly used complex scaling.

Since the wave function of the resonant state is\ndiverging away from the scattering potential, it has been previously difficult\nto follow its time evolution numerically in a finite area.\n"}
{"text":"  This paper concerns the use of neural networks for predicting the residual\nlife of machines and components. In addition, the advantage of using\ncondition-monitoring data to enhance the predictive capability of these neural\nnetworks was also investigated. A number of neural network variations were\ntrained and tested with the data of two different reliability-related datasets.\nThe first dataset represents the renewal case where the failed unit is repaired\nand restored to a good-as-new condition. Data was collected in the laboratory\nby subjecting a series of similar test pieces to fatigue loading with a\nhydraulic actuator. The average prediction error of the various neural networks\nbeing compared varied from 431 to 841 seconds on this dataset, where test\npieces had a characteristic life of 8,971 seconds. The second dataset was\ncollected from a group of pumps used to circulate a water and magnetite\nsolution within a plant. The data therefore originated from a repaired system\naffected by reliability degradation. When optimized, the multi-layer perceptron\nneural networks trained with the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm and the general\nregression neural network produced a sum-of-squares error within 11.1% of each\nother. The potential for using neural networks for residual life prediction and\nthe advantage of incorporating condition-based data into the model were proven\nfor both examples.\n"}

{"text":"  The Debye-H\\\"uckel theory describes rigorously the thermal equilibrium of\nclassical Coulomb fluids in the high-temperature $\\beta\\to 0$ regime ($\\beta$\ndenotes the inverse temperature). It is generally believed that the\nDebye-H\\\"uckel theory and the systematic high-temperature expansion provide an\nadequate description also in the region of small {\\em strictly positive} values\nof $\\beta>0$. This hypothesis is tested in the present paper on a\ntwo-dimensional Coulomb gas of pointlike $+\/-$ unit charges interacting via a\nlogarithmic potential which is equivalent to an integrable sine-Gordon field\nmodel. In particular, we apply a form factor method to obtain the exact\nasymptotic large-distance behavior of particle correlation functions,\nconsidered in the charge and number density combinations. We first determine\nthe general forms of the leading and subleading asymptotic terms at strictly\npositive $\\beta>0$ and then evaluate their high-temperature $\\beta\\to 0$ forms.\nIn the case of the {\\em charge} correlation function, the leading asymptotic\nterm at a strictly positive $\\beta>0$ is also the leading one in the\nhigh-temperature $\\beta\\to 0$ regime. On the contrary, the $\\beta\\to 0$\nbehavior of the {\\em number density} correlation function is accompanied by an\ninterference between the first two asymptotic terms. Consequently, the\nlarge-distance behavior of this function exhibits a discontinuity when going\nfrom strictly positive values of $\\beta>0$ to the Debye-H\\\"uckel limit\n$\\beta\\to 0$.

{"text":"  In order to explore the magnetostrophic regime expected for planetary cores,\nexperiments have been conducted in a rotating sphere filled with liquid sodium,\nwith an imposed dipolar magnetic field (the DTS setup). The field is produced\nby a permanent magnet enclosed in an inner sphere, which can rotate at a\nseparate rate, producing a spherical Couette flow. The flow properties are\ninvestigated by measuring electric potentials on the outer sphere, the induced\nmagnetic field in the laboratory frame, and velocity profiles inside the liquid\nsodium using ultrasonic Doppler velocimetry. The present article focuses on the\ntime-averaged axisymmetric part of the flow. The Doppler profiles show that the\nangular velocity of the fluid is relatively uniform in most of the fluid shell,\nbut rises near the inner sphere, revealing the presence of a magnetic wind, and\ngently drops towards the outer sphere. The transition from a magnetostrophic\nflow near the inner sphere to a geostrophic flow near the outer sphere is\ncontrolled by the local Elsasser number. For Rossby numbers up to order 1, the\nobserved velocity profiles all show a similar shape. Numerical simulations in\nthe linear regime are computed, and synthetic velocity profiles are compared\nwith the measured ones. In the geostrophic region, a torque-balance model\nprovides very good predictions. We find that the induced magnetic field varies\nin a consistent fashion, and displays a peculiar peak in the counter-rotating\nregime. This happens when the fluid rotation rate is almost equal and opposite\nto the outer sphere rotation rate. The fluid is then almost at rest in the\nlaboratory frame, and the Proudman-Taylor constraint vanishes, enabling a\nstrong meridional flow. We suggest that dynamo action might be favored in such\na situation.\n"}
{"text":"  In the equilibrium statistical mechanics of classical Coulomb fluids, the\nlong-range tail of the Coulomb potential gives rise to the Stillinger-Lovett\nsum rules for the charge correlation functions. For the jellium model of mobile\nparticles of charge $q$ immersed in a neutralizing background, the fixing of\none of the $q$-charges induces a screening cloud of the charge density whose\nzeroth and second moments are determined just by the Stillinger-Lovett sum\nrules. In this paper, we generalize these sum rules to the screening cloud\ninduced around a pointlike guest charge $Z q$ immersed in the bulk interior of\nthe 2D jellium with the coupling constant $\\Gamma=\\beta q^2$ ($\\beta$ is the\ninverse temperature), in the whole region of the thermodynamic stability of the\nguest charge $Z>-2\/\\Gamma$.

Radio continuum observations of the galaxy were carried out at 320\nMHz, 610 MHz and 1.4 GHz. Continuum emission was detected and mapped in the\ngalaxy. The emission appears extended over the inner disk at all three\nfrequencies. At 1.4 GHz and 610 MHz it appears to have two distinct lobes. We\nalso did optical spectroscopy of the galaxy nucleus; the spectrum did not show\nany strong emission lines associated with AGN activity but the presence of a\nweak AGN cannot be ruled out. Furthermore, comparison of the H$\\alpha$ flux and\nradio continuum at 1.4 GHz suggests that a significant fraction of the emission\nis non-thermal in nature. Hence we conclude that a weak or hidden AGN may be\npresent in PGC 045080. The extended radio emission represents lobes\/jets from\nthe AGN. These observations show that although LSB galaxies are metal poor and\nhave very little star formation, their centers can host significant AGN\nactivity.

In particular we discuss in detail the relative roles of magnetic\npressure and gas pressure (i.e., the value of the plasma-beta), as well as the\ndynamical aspects of the fine structures. Special attention is paid to recent\nnumerical simulations which include a complex magnetic topology, energy balance\n(heating and cooling processes), as well as the multidimensional radiative\ntransfer. Finally, we also show how new ground-based and space observations can\nreveal various physical aspects of the fine structures including their\nprominence-corona transition regions in relation to the orientation of the\nmagnetic field.\n"}
{"text":"  We report the measurement of extremely slow hole spin relaxation dynamics in\nsmall ensembles of self-assembled InGaAs quantum dots. Individual spin\norientated holes are optically created in the lowest orbital state of each dot\nand read out after a defined storage time using spin memory devices. The\nresulting luminescence signal exhibits a pronounced polarization memory effect\nthat vanishes for long storage times. The hole spin relaxation dynamics are\nmeasured as a function of external magnetic field and lattice temperature. We\nshow that hole spin relaxation can occur over remarkably long timescales in\nstrongly confined quantum dots (up to ~270 us), as predicted by recent theory.\nOur findings are supported by calculations that reproduce both the observed\nmagnetic field and temperature dependencies. The results suggest that hole spin\nrelaxation in strongly confined quantum dots is due to spin orbit mediated\nphonon scattering between Zeeman levels, in marked contrast to higher\ndimensional nanostructures where it is limited by valence band mixing.\n"}
{"text":"  Aims: I have analyzed a sample of seven nearby edge-on galaxies observed in\nthe V and K'-band, in order to infer the properties of the dust distribution.\n  Methods: A radiative transfer model, including scattering, have been used to\ndecompose each image into a stellar disk, a bulge, and a dust disk. The\nparameters describing the distributions have been obtained through standard X^2\nminimization techniques.\n  Results: The dust disks fitted to the V-band images are consistent with\nprevious work in literature: the radial scalelength of dust is larger than that\nfor stars (h_d\/h_s ~ 1.5); the dust disk has a smaller vertical scalelength\nthan the stellar (z_d\/z_s ~ 1\/3); the dust disk is almost transparent when seen\nface-on (central, face-on, optical depth tau_0 =0.5-1.5). Faster radiative\ntransfer models which neglect scattering can produce equivalent fits, with\nchanges in the derived parameters within the accuracy of full fits including\nscattering. In the K'-band, no trace is found of a second, massive, dust disk\nwhich has been invoked to explain observations of dust emission in the\nsubmillimeter. I discuss the model degeneracies and the effect of complex\nstructures on the fitted distributions. In particular, most bulges in the\nsample show a box\/peanuts morphology with large residuals; two\nlower-inclination galaxies show a dust ring distribution, which could be the\ncause for the large fitted dust scalelengths.\n"}

{"text":"  We analyzed the presently available experimental data on nucleon\nelectromagnetic form factors within a multipole model based on dispersion\nrelations. A good fit of the data is achieved by considering the coefficients\nof the multipole expansions as logarithmic functions of the momentum transfer\nsquared. The superconvergence relations, applied to this coefficients, makes\nthe model agree with unitary constraints and pQCD asymptotics for the Dirac and\nPauli form factors. The soft photon emission is proposed as a mechanism\nresponsible for the difference between the Rosenbluth, polarization and\nbeam--target--asymmetry data. It is shown, that the experimentally measured\ncross sections depend not only on the Dirac and Pauli form factors, but also on\nthe average number of the photons emitted. For proton this number is shown to\nbe different for different types of experimental measurements and then\nestimated phenomenologically. For neutron the same mechanism predicts, that the\ndata form different types of experiments must coincide with high accuracy. A\njoint fit of all the experimental data reproduce the $Q^2-$dependence with the\naccuracy $\\chi^2\/dof=0.86$. Predictions of the model, that 1) the ratios of the\nproton form factors $G_E\/G_M$ are different for Rosenbluth, polarization and\nbeam--target--asymmetry experiments and 2) similar ratios are nearly the same\nfor neutron, can be used for experimental verification of the model.\n"}
{"text":"  The problem of finding the asymptotic behavior of the maximal density of\nsphere packings in high Euclidean dimensions is one of the most fascinating and\nchallenging problems in discrete geometry. One century ago, Minkowski obtained\na rigorous lower bound that is controlled asymptotically by $1\/2^d$, where $d$\nis the Euclidean space dimension. An indication of the difficulty of the\nproblem can be garnered from the fact that exponential improvement of\nMinkowski's bound has proved to be elusive, even though existing upper bounds\nsuggest that such improvement should be possible. Using a\nstatistical-mechanical procedure to optimize the density associated with a\n\"test\" pair correlation function and a conjecture concerning the existence of\ndisordered sphere packings [S. Torquato and F. H. Stillinger, Experimental\nMath. {\\bf 15}, 307 (2006)], the putative exponential improvement was found\nwith an asymptotic behavior controlled by $1\/2^{(0.77865...)d}$. Using the same\nmethods, we investigate whether this exponential improvement can be further\nimproved by exploring other test pair correlation functions correponding to\ndisordered packings. We demonstrate that there are simpler test functions that\nlead to the same asymptotic result. More importantly, we show that there is a\nwide class of test functions that lead to precisely the same exponential\nimprovement and therefore the asymptotic form $1\/2^{(0.77865...)d}$ is much\nmore general than previously surmised.\n"}

There we have addressed the issue of conformal invariance imposing the\ntheory to be finite and we have found that finiteness requires reality of the\ndeformation parameter \\beta. In this paper we relax the finiteness request and\nlook for a theory that in the planar limit has vanishing beta functions. We\nperform explicit calculations up to five loop order: we find that the\nconditions of beta function vanishing can be achieved with a complex\ndeformation parameter, but the theory is not finite and the result depends on\nthe arbitrary choice of the subtraction procedure. Therefore, while the\nfiniteness condition leads to a scheme independent result, so that the\nconformal invariant theory with a real deformation is physically well defined,\nthe condition of vanishing beta function leads to a result which is scheme\ndependent and therefore of unclear significance. In order to show that these\nfindings are not an artefact of dimensional regularization, we confirm our\nresults within the differential renormalization approach.\n"}
{"text":"  It is well known that multigrid methods are optimally efficient for solution\nof elliptic equations (O(N)), which means that effort is proportional to the\nnumber of points at which the solution is evaluated). Thus this is an ideal\nmethod to solve the initial data\/constraint equations in General Relativity for\n(for instance) black hole interactions, or for other strong-field gravitational\nconfigurations. Recent efforts have produced finite difference multigrid\nsolvers for domains with holes (excised regions). We present here the extension\nof these concepts to higher order (fourth-, sixth- and eigth-order). The high\norder convergence allows rapid solution on relatively small computational\ngrids. Also, general relativity evolution codes are moving to typically\nfourth-order; data have to be computed at least as accurately as this same\norder for straightfoward demonstration of the proper order of convergence in\nthe evolution.\n  Our vertex-centered multigrid code demonstrates globally high-order-accurate\nsolutions of elliptic equations over domains containing holes, in two spatial\ndimensions with fixed (Dirichlet) outer boundary conditions, and in three\nspatial dimensions with {\\it Robin} outer boundary conditions. We demonstrate a\n``real world'' 3-dimensional problem which is the solution of the conformally\nflat Hamiltonian constraint of General Relativity. The success of this method\ndepends on: a) the choice of the discretization near the holes; b) the\ndefinition of the location of the inner boundary, which allows resolution of\nthe hole even on the coarsest grids; and on maintaining the same order of\nconvergence at the boundaries as in the interior of the computational domain.\n"}

The current $t \\bar t$\ndata from the Tevatron rule out axigluon masses ($m_A$) up to 900 GeV and 850\nGeV at 2 $\\sigma$ and 4 $\\sigma$ levels respectively. For the case of flavour\nuniversal colorons the data rule out a mass ($m_C$) below 800 GeV (780 GeV) at\nthe $2 (4) \\sigma $ level and also the mass range between 900 GeV to 2.1 TeV at\n2 $\\sigma$ level, for $\\cot \\xi = 1$, where $\\xi$ is the mixing angle.

This survey provides a high quality set of spectroscopic data for\n~6000 galaxies in 48 clusters. A salient feature of this model is the\npossibility of treating dust extinction as a function of age, allowing younger\nstars to be more obscured than older ones. Our technique, for the first time,\ntakes into account this feature in a spectral fitting code. A set of template\nspectra spanning a wide range of star formation histories is built, with\nfeatures closely resembling those of typical spectra in our sample in terms of\nspectral resolution, noise and wavelength coverage. Our method of analyzing\nthese spectra allows us to test the reliability and the uncertainties related\nto each physical parameter we are inferring. The well-known degeneracy problem,\ni.e. the non-uniqueness of the best fit solution (mass and extinction in\ndifferent age bins), can be addressed by assigning adequate error bars to the\nrecovered parameters. The values found in this way, together with their error\nbars, identify the region of parameter space which contains all the possible\nsolutions for a given spectrum. A comparison test was also performed on a WINGS\nsubsample, containing objects in common with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey,\nyielding excellent agreement.

The existence of\ngravitational radiation was first predicted by Einstein in 1916, however\ngravitational waves have not yet been directly observed. One source of\ngravitation radiation is binary inspiral. Two compact bodies orbiting each\nother, such as a pair of black holes, lose energy to gravitational radiation.\nAs the system loses energy the bodies spiral towards each other. This causes\ntheir orbital speed and the amount of gravitational radiation to increase,\nproducing a characteristic ``chirp'' waveform in the LIGO sensitive band. In\nthis thesis, matched filtering of LIGO science data is used to search for low\nmass binary systems in the halo of dark matter surrounding the Milky Way.\nObservations of gravitational microlensing events of stars in the Large\nMagellanic Cloud suggest that some fraction of the dark matter in the halo may\nbe in the form of Massive Astrophysical Compact Halo Objects (MACHOs). It has\nbeen proposed that low mass black holes formed in the early universe may be a\ncomponent of the MACHO population; some fraction of these black hole MACHOs\nwill be in binary systems and detectable by LIGO. The inspiral from a MACHO\nbinary composed of two 0.5 solar mass black holes enters the LIGO sensitive\nband around 40 Hz. The chirp signal increases in amplitude and frequency,\nsweeping through the sensitive band to 4400 Hz in 140 seconds.

We\nfocus only on high-ionization BALs and find a number of significant results.\nWhile quasars accreting near the Eddington limit are more likely to show BALs\nthan lower $L\/L_{Edd}$ systems, BALs are present in quasars accreting at only a\nfew percent Eddington. We find a stronger effect with bolometric luminosity,\nsuch that the most luminous quasars are more likely to show BALs. There is an\nadditional effect, previously known, that BAL quasars are redder on average\nthan unabsorbed quasars. The strongest effects involving the quasar physical\nproperties and BAL properties are related to terminal outflow velocity. Maximum\nobserved outflow velocities increase with both the bolometric luminosity and\nthe blueness of the spectral slope, suggesting that the ultraviolet luminosity\nto a great extent determines the acceleration. These results support the idea\nof outflow acceleration via ultraviolet line scattering.\n"}

{"text":"  We study the massive gravity theory proposed by Arkani-Hamed, Georgi and\nSchwartz. In this theory, the graviton becomes massive when general covariance\nis spontaneously broken through the introduction of a field that links two\nmetrics, one of the which will eventually decouple. The excitation of this\n\"link\" field acts like a Goldstone boson in giving mass to the graviton. We\nwork out the graviton and Goldstone boson propagators explicitly by means of\ngauge fixing terms similar to the renormalizability gauges used in gauge\ntheories. With these propagators, we calculate the lowest order tree-level\ninteraction between two external energy momentum tensors. The result is\nindependent of the gauge parameter, but different from the prediction of\nmassless gravity theory, i.e., general relativity. This difference remains even\nif the mass of the graviton goes to zero, in which case it gives the van\nDam-Veltman-Zakharov (vDVZ) discontinuity between the propagators of a massive\nand massless linearized graviton. Moreover, we show that the Fierz-Pauli\ngraviton mass term can be considered as the ``unitary gauge'' of a more general\ntheory with an extra scalar field. We explicitly construct such a theory in\nwhich the vDVZ discontinuity arises with a graviton mass term that is different\nfrom the Fierz-Pauli mass term. This theory has a local Weyl symmetry under\nconformal transformations of the metric. In the case when the mass goes to\nzero, the Weyl summetry becomes a global symmetry. It is possible that the\nlocal Weyl symmetry will give a hint as to the form of the corresponding fully\nnonlinear theory having a nonzero graviton mass.\n"}
{"text":"  This series of papers investigates the early stages of planet formation by\nmodeling the evolution of the gas and solid content of protostellar disks from\nthe early T Tauri phase until complete dispersal of the gas.

Using the assumption that the grain size distribution\nfunction always maintains a power-law structure approximating the average\noutcome of the exact coagulation\/shattering equation, the model focuses on the\ncalculation of the growth rate of the largest grains only. The coupled\nevolution equations for the maximum grain size, the surface density of the gas\nand the surface density of solids are then presented and solved\nself-consistently using a standard 1+1 dimensional formalism. I show that the\nglobal evolution of solids is controlled by a leaky reservoir of small grains\nat large radii, and propose an empirically derived evolution equation for the\ntotal mass of solids, which can be used to estimate the total heavy element\nretention efficiency in the planet formation paradigm. Consistency with\nobservation of the total mass of solids in the Minimum Solar Nebula augmented\nwith the mass of the Oort cloud sets strong upper limit on the initial grain\nsize distribution, as well as on the turbulent parameter $\\alphat$.

{"text":"  We propose a 4+1-dimensional action that is a candidate for realising a\nstandard-model-like effective theory for fields dynamically localised to a\ndomain-wall brane.

The density matrix is studied in a formalism which\nincludes generation of the ingoing state and absorption of the final state.\nThen the dependence of the final state on the conventional scattering amplitude\nfor the microsystem is highly non-linear.\n  In the thermodynamic limit of the macrosystem, the density matrix of the\nensemble (of microsystem plus macrosystem) develops into a final state which\ninvolves a set of macroscopically distinguishable states, each with the\nmicrosystem in one of the basis vector states and the macrosystem in an\nentangled state.\n  For an element of the ensemble, i.e., for a single measurement, the result is\ninstead a random walk, where the microsystem ends up in one of the basis vector\nstates (reduction of the wave packet).\n"}
{"text":"  We obtained comprehensive sets of elemental abundances for eleven damped\nLy-alpha systems (DLAs) at z_DLA=1.7-2.5. In Paper I of this series, we showed\nfor three DLA galaxies that we can derive their star formation histories and\nages from a detailed comparison of their intrinsic abundance patterns with\nchemical evolution models. We determine in this paper the star formation\nproperties of six additional DLA galaxies. The derived results confirm that no\nsingle star formation history explains the diverse sets of abundance patterns\nin DLAs. We demonstrate that the various star formation histories reproducing\nthe DLA abundance patterns are typical of local irregular, dwarf starburst and\nquiescent spiral galaxies. Independent of the star formation history, the DLAs\nhave a common characteristic of being weak star forming galaxies; models with\nhigh star formation efficiencies are ruled out. All the derived DLA star\nformation rates per unit area are moderate or low, with values between -3.2 <\nlog SFR < -1.1 M_sol yr^{-1} kpc^{-2}. The DLA abundance patterns require a\nlarge spread in ages ranging from 20 Myr up to 3 Gyr. The oldest DLA in our\nsample is observed at z_DLA=1.864 with an age estimated to more than 3 Gyr; it\nnicely indicates that galaxies were already forming at z_f>10. But, most of the\nDLAs show ages much younger than that of the Universe at the epoch of\nobservation. Young galaxies thus seem to populate the high redshift Universe at\nz>2, suggesting relatively low redshifts of formation (z~3) for most\nhigh-redshift galaxies. The DLA star formation properties are compared with\nthose of other high-redshift galaxies identified in deep imaging surveys with\nthe aim of obtaining a global picture of high-redshift objects.\n"}
{"text":"  Three-dimensional (3D) chromatin structure is closely related to genome\nfunction, in particular transcription.

Interpretation of our results and those\npublished by others, based on polymer physics, shows that the folding of the\nchromatin fiber can be described as a polymer in a globular state (GS),\nmaintained by intra-polymer attractive interactions that counteract\nself-avoidance forces. The GS polymer model is able to describe chromatin\nfolding in as well the highly expressed domains as the lowly expressed ones,\nindicating that they differ in Kuhn length and chromatin compaction. Each type\nof genomic domain constitutes an ensemble of relatively compact globular\nfolding states, resulting in a considerable cellto- cell variation between\notherwise identical cells. We present evidence for different polymer folding\nregimes of the chromatin fiber on the length scale of a few mega base pairs and\non that of complete chromosome arms (several tens of Mb). Our results present a\nnovel view on the folding of the chromatin fiber in interphase and open the\npossibility to explore the nature of the intra-chromatin fiber interactions.\n"}

The redshift of the companion is within 100 km\/s\nof the BCG and has certainly interacted with the BCG, and is likely bound to\nit.

The velocity structure\nof the emission-line bar between the BCG nucleus and the companion galaxy\nprovides strong evidence for an interaction between the two in the last ~50\nMyrs. The age of the radio source is similar to the interaction time, so this\ninteraction may have provoked an episode of radio activity. We estimate a star\nformation rate of >7 solar mass\/yr based on the Halpha and archival UV data, a\nrate similar to, but somewhat lower than, the revised X-ray cooling rate of\n10-30 solar masses\/year estimated from XMM spectra by Peterson & workers.

We obtain a\nform for the operator responsible for the leading correction associated with\nfinite nuclear size -- the so-called \"Schiff moment\" operator -- and observe\nthat it differs from the corresponding operator used in previous Schiff moment\ncomputations. We show that the more general Schiff moment operator reduces to\nthe previously employed operator only under certain approximations that are not\ngenerally justified. We also identify other corrections to Schiff screening\nthat may not be included properly in previous theoretical treatments.

{"text":"  Steady state accretion discs larger than ~ 0.01-0.1 pc are known to be\ngravitationally unstable for the accretion rates needed to explain\nsuper-massive black hole (SMBH) activity. We propose that SMBH are fed by a\nsuccession of mass deposition events with randomly directed angular momenta.\nBecause of incomplete angular momentum cancellation a warped accretion disc\nforms in the inner few parsec. The orientation of the disc performs a random\nwalk. Deposition of new material promotes SMBH accretion at rates much faster\nthan viscous. Observational implications of this picture include: (i) lighter\naccretion discs that can fuel AGN and quasars and yet avoid star formation at R\n>> 0.1 pc; (ii) star formation inside the disc is not a function of mass\naccretion rate only. It can take place at high or low accretion rates, e.g.,\nwhen too few clouds arrive in the inner region. An example of this might be the\ncentral parsec of our Galaxy. (iii) The discs can form Compton-thick obscuring\nstructures of ~ parsec size as required in AGN unification models; (iv) faster\nblack hole growth resulting from misalignment of the disc and the black hole\nspin in the early Universe; (v) Isotropic deposition of SMBH energy and\nmomentum feedback in the galaxy bulge. This may help explain the high\nefficiency with which it seems to be operating in the Universe.

The BS potential follows from a proper\nansatz on the Wilson loop to encode confinement and is the sum of a\none-gluon-exchange and a confinement terms. Besides, the common perturbative\nstrong coupling is replaced by the ghost-free expression \\alpha_E(Q^2)\naccording to the prescription of Analytic Perturbation Theory (APT). The\nagreement of \\alpha_s^{exp}(Q^2) with the APT coupling \\alpha_E(Q^2) turns out\nto be reasonable from 1 GeV down to the 200 MeV scale, thus confirming\nquantitatively the validity of the APT prescription.

The data therefore provide no compelling evidence for\nundetected baryonic components, particularly any that vary in importance with\ncluster mass. A unique feature of the current analysis is direct inclusion of\nthe contribution of intracluster light (ICL) in the baryon budget. The increase\nin X-ray gas mass fraction with increasing total mass is entirely accounted for\nby a decrease in the total stellar mass fraction, supporting the argument that\nthe behavior of both the stellar and X-ray gas components is dominated by a\ndecrease in star formation efficiency in more massive environments.

The\ndynamics is modeled using the two-dimensional, axisymmetric thin-shell\nequations. In the first ~10-100 seconds after core collapse the magnetar\ninflates a bubble of plasma and magnetic fields behind the supernova shock. The\nbubble expands asymmetrically because of the pinching effect of the toroidal\nmagnetic field, just as in the analogous problem of the evolution of pulsar\nwind nebulae. The degree of asymmetry depends on E_mag\/E_tot. The correct value\nof E_mag\/E_tot is uncertain because of uncertainties in the conversion of\nmagnetic energy into kinetic energy at large radii in relativistic winds; we\nargue, however, that bubbles inflated by newly formed magnetars are likely to\nbe significantly more magnetized than their pulsar counterparts. We show that\nfor a ratio of magnetic to total power supplied by the central magnetar\nL_mag\/L_tot ~ 0.1 the bubble expands relatively spherically. For L_mag\/L_tot ~\n0.3, however, most of the pressure in the bubble is exerted close to the\nrotation axis, driving a collimated outflow out through the host star. This can\naccount for the collimation inferred from observations of long-duration\ngamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Outflows from magnetars become increasingly\nmagnetically dominated at late times, due to the decrease in neutrino-driven\nmass loss as the young neutron star cools. We thus suggest that the\nmagnetar-driven bubble initially expands relatively spherically, enhancing the\nenergy of the associated supernova, while at late times it becomes\nprogressively more collimated, producing the GRB.\n"}

{"text":"  We consider global and gravitational lensing properties of the recently\nsuggested Einstein clusters of WIMPs as galactic dark matter halos.

Due to this property, Einstein clusters may be considered as dark\nmatter candidates. We analyse the stability of the Einstein clusters against\nboth radial and non-radial pulsations, and we show that the Einstein clusters\nare dynamically stable. With the use of the Buchdahl type inequalities for\nanisotropic bodies, we derive upper limits on the velocity of the particles\ndefining the cluster. These limits are consistent with those obtained from\nstability considerations. The study of light deflection shows that the\ngravitational lensing effect is slightly smaller for the Einstein clusters, as\ncompared to the singular isothermal density sphere model for dark matter.\nTherefore lensing observations may discriminate, at least in principle, between\nEinstein cluster and other dark matter models.\n"}

This paper\nreports the performances of the charge injection capability based on the ground\nexperiments using a radiation damaged device, and in-orbit measurements of the\nXIS. The ground experiments show that charges are stably injected with the\ndispersion of 91eV in FWHM in a specific column for the charges equivalent to\nthe X-ray energy of 5.1keV.

{"text":"  Secular variations of the geomagnetic field have been measured with a\ncontinuously improving accuracy during the last few hundred years, culminating\nnowadays with satellite data. It is however well known that the dynamics of the\nmagnetic field is linked to that of the velocity field in the core and any\nattempt to model secular variations will involve a coupled dynamical system for\nmagnetic field and core velocity. Unfortunately, there is no direct observation\nof the velocity. Independently of the exact nature of the above-mentioned\ncoupled system -- some version being currently under construction -- the\nquestion is debated in this paper whether good knowledge of the magnetic field\ncan be translated into good knowledge of core dynamics. Furthermore, what will\nbe the impact of the most recent and precise geomagnetic data on our knowledge\nof the geomagnetic field of the past and future? These questions are cast into\nthe language of variational data assimilation, while the dynamical system\nconsidered in this paper consists in a set of two oversimplified\none-dimensional equations for magnetic and velocity fields.

This disc must become thicker and sub-Keplerian with increasing accretion\nrates. These can affect the line profiles and in turn can influence the\nestimation of the accretion disc and black hole parameters from the observed\nline profiles. We here embark on, for the first time, a fully relativistic\ncomputation which offers key insights into the effects of geometrical thickness\nand the sub-Keplerian orbital velocity on the line profiles.

By using an extrapolation\ntechnique developed and tested in our previous study [1], we explicitly\ndetermine the threshold for a wide range of compactnesses using four sequences\nof models of constant baryonic mass comprising a total of 59 stellar models.\nOur calculation of the threshold is in good agreement with the Newtonian\nprediction and improves the previous post-Newtonian estimates. In addition, we\nfind that for stars with sufficiently large mass and compactness, the m=3\ndeformation is the fastest growing one. For all of the models considered, the\nnon-axisymmetric instability is suppressed on a dynamical timescale with an m=1\ndeformation dominating the final stages of the instability. These results,\ntogether with those presented in [1], suggest that an m=1 deformation\nrepresents a general and late-time feature of non-axisymmetric dynamical\ninstabilities both in full General Relativity and in Newtonian gravity.\n"}
{"text":"  We present a method for the direct and continuous separation of red and white\nblood cells from plasma at the microscale. The method is implemented in a\nmicrofluidic system with magnetic functionality. The fluidic structure within\nthe microsystem consists of an inlet and a single microfluidic channel with\nmultiple outlets. The magnetic functionality is provided by an array of\nintegrated soft-magnetic elements that are embedded transverse and adjacent to\nthe microchannel. The elements are magnetized using an external field, and once\nmagnetized they produce a magnetic force on blood cells as they flow through\nthe microchannel. In whole blood, white blood cells (WBCs) behave as\ndiamagnetic microparticles, while red blood cells (RBCs) exhibit diamagnetic or\nparamagnetic behavior depending on the oxygenation of their hemoglobin. We\nstudy the motion of blood cells through the microchannel using a mathematical\nmodel that takes into account the magnetic, fluidic and gravitational forces on\nthe cells. We use the model to study blood cell separation, and our analysis\nindicates that the microsystem is capable of separating WBC-rich plasma,\ndeoxygenated RBC-rich plasma and cell-depleted plasma into respective outlets.\n"}

A more refined interpretation comes\nfrom new three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations that are capable of\nreproducing the corrugated shape of magnetic flux concentrations and their\nsignature in the visible continuum.

Most of the galaxies with\nFRI morphology and\/or low-excitation emission-line spectra have progressively\nlower BH masses at lower photoionizing (and jet) luminosities. This agrees with\nthe Ledlow-Owen relation which states that the radio luminosity at the FRI\/FRII\ntransition depends on the optical luminosity of the host, L_radio ~\nL_optical^1.8, because both L_radio and L_optical relate to AGN nuclear\nparameters.

{"text":"  We analyze fading interference relay networks where M single-antenna\nsource-destination terminal pairs communicate concurrently and in the same\nfrequency band through a set of K single-antenna relays using half-duplex\ntwo-hop relaying. Assuming that the relays have channel state information\n(CSI), it is shown that in the large-M limit, provided K grows fast enough as a\nfunction of M, the network \"decouples\" in the sense that the individual\nsource-destination terminal pair capacities are strictly positive. The\ncorresponding required rate of growth of K as a function of M is found to be\nsufficient to also make the individual source-destination fading links converge\nto nonfading links. We say that the network \"crystallizes\" as it breaks up into\na set of effectively isolated \"wires in the air\". A large-deviations analysis\nis performed to characterize the \"crystallization\" rate, i.e., the rate (as a\nfunction of M,K) at which the decoupled links converge to nonfading links. In\nthe course of this analysis, we develop a new technique for characterizing the\nlarge-deviations behavior of certain sums of dependent random variables. For\nthe case of no CSI at the relay level, assuming amplify-and-forward relaying,\nwe compute the per source-destination terminal pair capacity for M,K converging\nto infinity, with K\/M staying fixed, using tools from large random matrix\ntheory.\n"}
{"text":"  A brief introduction is given to the subject of brane induced gravity. The 5D\nexample is discussed in detail. The 4D laws of gravity are obtained on a brane\nembedded in an infinite volume extra space, where the problem of stabilization\nof the volume modulus is absent. The theory has two classically disjoint\nbranches of solutions -- the conventional and self-accelerated one. The\nconventional branch gives a perturbatively stable model of a metastable\ngraviton, with potentially testable predictions within the Solar system. The\nself-accelerated branch, on the other hand, provides an existence proof for an\nidea that the accelerated expansion of the Universe could be due to modified\ngravity. The issue of perturbative stability of the self-accelerated branch is\nobscured by a breakdown of the conventional perturbative expansion. However, a\ncertain exact non-perturbative solution found in hep-th\/0612016 exhibits a net\nnegative gravitational mass, while this mass is positive on the conventional\nbranch. This suggest that the self-accelerated solution must be\nnon-perturbatively unstable. A proposal to overcome this problem in an\nextension of the original model, that also allows for the quantum gravity scale\nto be unrestricted, is briefly discussed.\n"}

{"text":"  In this thesis, we consider some spin effects in QCD and recurrence lattices\nwith multi-site exchanges. Main topic of our manuscript are critical phenomena\nin spin systems defined on the recurrence lattices. Main tool of our approach\nis the method of recursive (hierarchical) lattices. We apply the method of\ndynamical mapping (or recursive lattices) for investigation of magnetic\nproperties of the fluid and solid $^3$He, phase transitions in crystals and\nmacromolecules. First, we analyze the helix-coil phase transition for\npolypeptides and proteins, and describe an quasi unfolding transition (like the\ncold denaturation process) for the degree of helicity (the order parameter for\nmacromolecules). Next we consider the recurrent models of $^3$He defined on the\nsquare, Husimi and hexagon lattices. Using the method of dynamical mapping, the\nmagnetization curves with plateaus, bifurcation point and one period doubling\nare obtained. Then we investigate the model with cubic symmetry defined on the\nBethe lattice and containing both linear and quadratic spin-spin interactions.\nThe magnetization of the system is calculated, and a complex structure of the\nphase transitions between the disordered, partially ordered and completely\nordered states is observed. In the framework of QCD, we consider the azimuthal\nasymmetries in heavy flavor production in the lepton-nucleon deep inelastic\nscattering (DIS). We calculate the azimuthal (or $\\phi$-) dependence of the\nnext-to-leading order heavy-quark-initiated contributions to DIS. It is shown\nthat, contrary to the basic gluon-initiated component, the photon-quark\nscattering mechanism is practically $\\cos2\\phi$-independent.

{"text":"  A problem which has recently attracted research attention is that of\nestimating the distribution of flow sizes in internet traffic. On high traffic\nlinks it is sometimes impossible to record every packet. Researchers have\napproached the problem of estimating flow lengths from sampled packet data in\ntwo separate ways. Firstly, different sampling methodologies can be tried to\nmore accurately measure the desired system parameters. One such method is the\nsample-and-hold method where, if a packet is sampled, all subsequent packets in\nthat flow are sampled. Secondly, statistical methods can be used to ``invert''\nthe sampled data and produce an estimate of flow lengths from a sample.\n  In this paper we propose, implement and test two variants on the\nsample-and-hold method. In addition we show how the sample-and-hold method can\nbe inverted to get an estimation of the genuine distribution of flow sizes.\nExperiments are carried out on real network traces to compare standard packet\nsampling with three variants of sample-and-hold. The methods are compared for\ntheir ability to reconstruct the genuine distribution of flow sizes in the\ntraffic.\n"}

Physics in one dimension is a fascinating topic for theory and\nexperiment: for the former often a simplification, for the latter always a\nchallenge. Various ways will be demonstrated how one-dimensional structures can\nbe achieved in reality. In particular organic conductors could establish\nthemselves as model systems for the investigation of the physics in reduced\ndimensions.\n  In the metallic state of a one-dimensional solid, Fermi-liquid theory breaks\ndown and spin and charge degrees of freedom become separated. But the metallic\nphase is not stable in one dimension: as the temperature is reduced, the\nelectronic charge and spin tend to arrange themselves in an ordered fashion due\nto strong correlations. The competition of the different interactions is\nresponsible for which broken-symmetry ground state is eventually realized in a\nspecific compound and which drives the system towards an insulating state.\n  Here we review the various ordering phenomena and how they can be identified\nby dielectric and optic measurements.\n"}

{"text":"  Many ambitious experiments have been proposed to constrain dark energy and\ndetect its evolution. At present, observational constraints are consistent with\na cosmological constant and there is no firm evidence for any evolution in the\ndark energy equation of state w. In this paper, we pose the following question:\nsuppose that future dark energy surveys constrain w at low redshift to be\nconsistent with -1 to a percent level accuracy, what are the implications for\nmodels of dynamical dark energy? We investigate this problem in a\nmodel-independent way by following quintessence field trajectories in `energy'\nphase-space. Attractor dynamics in this phase-space leads to two classes of\nacceptable models: 1) models with flat potentials, i.e. an effective\ncosmological constant, and 2) models with potentials that suddenly flatten with\na characteristic kink. The prospect of further constraining the second class of\nmodels from distance measurements and fluctuation growth rates at low redshift\n(z<3) seems poor. However, in some models of this second class, the dark energy\nmakes a significant contribution to the total energy density at high redshift.\nSuch models can be further constrained from observation of the cosmic microwave\nbackground anisotropies and from primordial nucleosynthesis. It is possible,\ntherefore, to construct models in which the dark energy at high redshift causes\nobservable effects, even if future dark energy surveys constrain w at low\nredshift to be consistent with -1 to high precision.\n"}

{"text":"  We present analytical and numerical studies of phase-coherent dynamics of\nintrinsically localized excitations (breathers) in a system of two weakly\ncoupled nonlinear oscillator chains. We show that there are two qualitatively\ndifferent dynamical regimes of the coupled breathers, either immovable or\nslowly-moving: the periodic transverse translation (wandering) of low-amplitude\nbreather between the chains, and the one-chain-localization of high-amplitude\nbreather. These two modes of coupled nonlinear excitations, which involve large\nnumber of anharmonic oscillators, can be mapped onto two solutions of a single\npendulum equation, detached by a separatrix mode. We also study two-chain\nbreathers, which can be considered as bound states of discrete breathers with\ndifferent symmetry and center locations in the coupled chains, and bifurcation\nof the anti-phase two-chain breather into the one-chain one. Delocalizing\ntransition of 1D breather in 2D system of a large number of parallel coupled\nnonlinear chains is described, in which the breather, initially excited in a\ngiven chain, abruptly spreads its vibration energy in the whole 2D system upon\ndecreasing breather frequency or amplitude below the threshold one. The\nthreshold breather frequency is above the cut off phonon frequency in 2D\nsystem, and the threshold breather amplitude scales as square root of the\ninter-chain coupling constant. Delocalizing transition of discrete vibrational\nbreather in 2D and 3D systems of coupled nonlinear chains has an analogy with\ndelocalizing transition for Bose-Einstein condensates in 2D and 3D optical\nlattices.\n"}

{"text":"  The physical interpretation of scattering line polarization offers a novel\ndiagnostic window for exploring the thermal and magnetic structure of the quiet\nregions of the solar atmosphere.

{"text":"  Bigravity is a natural arena where a non-linear theory of massive gravity can\nbe formulated. If the interaction between the metrics $f$ and $g$ is\nnon-derivative, spherically symmetric exact solutions can be found.

The spectrum of linearized perturbations around such\nbackgrounds contains a massless as well as a massive graviton, with {\\em two}\nphysical polarizations each. There are no propagating vectors or scalars, and\nthe theory is ghost free (as happens with certain massive gravities with\nexplicit breaking of Lorentz invariance).

We found that the\nmodels can reproduce with reasonable accuracy the stellar colours for a fair\ninterval in effective temperatures and gravities. The exceptions are: 1) the\nU-B colour, where the models are typically redder than the observations, and;\n2) the very cool stars in general (V-K > ~3).Concerning the high resolution\nfeatures, we measured 35 spectral indices defined in the literature on three\nhigh resolution synthetic libraries (Coelho et al. 2005; Martins et al. 2005;\nMunari et al. 2005), and compared them with the observed measurements given by\nthree empirical libraries (Valdes et al.2004; Sanchez-Blazquez et al. 2006;\nPrugniel & Soubiran 2001).

{"text":"  We present an analysis of a Suzaku observation of the link region between the\ngalaxy clusters A399 and A401. We obtained the metallicity of the intracluster\nmedium (ICM) up to the cluster virial radii for the first time. We determine\nthe metallicity where the virial radii of the two clusters cross each other (~2\nMpc away from their centers) and found that it is comparable to that in their\ninner regions (~0.2 Zsun). It is unlikely that the uniformity of metallicity up\nto the virial radii is due to mixing caused by a cluster collision. Since the\nram-pressure is too small to strip the interstellar medium of galaxies around\nthe virial radius of a cluster, the fairly high metallicity that we found there\nindicates that the metals in the ICM are not transported from member galaxies\nby ram-pressure stripping. Instead, the uniformity suggests that the\nproto-cluster region was extensively polluted with metals by extremely powerful\noutflows (superwinds) from galaxies before the clusters formed.

The number density per unit redshift is known to\ndecrease for weak MgII absorbers between z~1 and z~2 by a greater amount than\npredicted from cosmological effects and changes in the extragalactic ionizing\nbackground alone. We suggest that, because the physical properties of the\nabsorber population are not seen to change significantly across this range,\nthat the evolution in dN\/dz is due to a decrease in the activity that gives\nrise to weak MgII absorption, and not due to a change in the processes that\nform weak MgII absorbers. The presence of separate, but aligned (in velocity)\nlow and high density clouds in all single cloud weak MgII absorbers provides an\nimportant diagnostic of their geometry. We discuss possible origins in dwarf\ngalaxies and in extragalactic analogs to high velocity clouds.\n"}
{"text":"  We present a study of the shapes, orientations, and alignments of Galactic\ndark matter subhalos in the ``Via Lactea'' simulation of a Milky Way-size LCDM\nhost halo. Whereas isolated dark matter halos tend to be prolate, subhalos are\npredominantly triaxial. Overall subhalos are more spherical than the host halo,\nwith minor to major and intermediate to major axis ratios of 0.68 and 0.83,\nrespectively. Like isolated halos, subhalos tend to be less spherical in their\ncentral regions. The principal axis ratios are independent of subhalo mass,\nwhen the shapes are measured within a physical scale like r_Vmax, the radius of\nthe peak of the circular velocity curve. Subhalos tend to be slightly more\nspherical closer to the host halo center. The spatial distribution of the\nsubhalos traces the prolate shape of the host halo when they are selected by\nthe largest V_max they ever had, i.e. before they experienced strong tidal mass\nloss. The subhalos' orientation is not random: the major axis tends to align\nwith the direction towards the host halo center. This alignment disappears for\nhalos beyond 3 r_200 and is more pronounced when the shapes are measured in the\nouter regions of the subhalos. The radial alignment is preserved during a\nsubhalo's orbit and they become elongated during pericenter passage, indicating\nthat the alignment is likely caused by the host halo's tidal forces. These\ntidal interactions with the host halo act to make subhalos rounder over time.\n"}

{"text":"  The operator-valued Schur-class is defined to be the set of holomorphic\nfunctions $S$ mapping the unit disk into the space of contraction operators\nbetween two Hilbert spaces. There are a number of alternate characterizations:\nthe operator of multiplication by $S$ defines a contraction operator between\ntwo Hardy Hilbert spaces, $S$ satisfies a von Neumann inequality, a certain\noperator-valued kernel associated with $S$ is positive-definite, and $S$ can be\nrealized as the transfer function of a dissipative (or even conservative)\ndiscrete-time linear input\/state\/output linear system. Various multivariable\ngeneralizations of this class have appeared recently,one of the most\nencompassing being that of Muhly and Solel where the unit disk is replaced by\nthe strict unit ball of the elements of a dual correspondence $E^{\\sigma}$\nassociated with a $W^{*}$-correspondence $E$ over a $W^{*}$-algebra $\\cA$\ntogether with a $*$-representation $\\sigma$ of $\\cA$.

In this way we are able to\nmake the analogy between the Muhly-Solel Schur class and the classical Schur\nclass more complete.

{"text":"  The extended Hubbard Hamiltonian is a widely accepted model for uncovering\nthe effects of strong correlations on the phase diagram of low-dimensional\nsystems, and a variety of theoretical techniques have been applied to it. In\nthis paper the world-line quantum Monte Carlo method is used to study spin,\ncharge, and bond order correlations of the one-dimensional extended Hubbard\nmodel in the presence of coupling to the lattice. A static alternating lattice\ndistortion (the ionic Hubbard model) leads to enhanced charge density wave\ncorrelations at the expense of antiferromagnetic order. When the lattice\ndegrees of freedom are dynamic (the Hubbard-Holstein model), we show that a\nsimilar effect occurs even though the charge asymmetry must arise\nspontaneously. Although the evolution of the total energy with lattice coupling\nis smooth, the individual components exhibit sharp crossovers at the phase\nboundaries.

{"text":"  We continue the study of the non-metric theory of gravity introduced in\nhep-th\/0611182 and gr-qc\/0703002 and obtain its general spherically symmetric\nvacuum solution. It respects the analog of the Birkhoff theorem, i.e., the\nvacuum spherically symmetric solution is necessarily static. As in general\nrelativity, the spherically symmetric solution is seen to describe a black\nhole. The exterior geometry is essentially the same as in the Schwarzschild\ncase, with power-law corrections to the Newtonian potential. The behavior\ninside the black-hole region is different from the Schwarzschild case in that\nthe usual spacetime singularity gets replaced by a singular surface of a new\ntype, where all basic fields of the theory remain finite but metric ceases to\nexist. The theory does not admit arbitrarily small black holes: for small\nobjects, the curvature on the would-be horizon is so strong that non-metric\nmodifications prevent the horizon from being formed. The theory allows for\nmodifications of gravity of very interesting nature. We discuss three physical\neffects, namely, (i) correction to Newton's law in the neighborhood of the\nsource, (ii) renormalization of effective gravitational and cosmological\nconstants at large distances from the source, and (iii) additional redshift\nfactor between spatial regions of different curvature. The first two effects\ncan be responsible, respectively, for the observed anomaly in the acceleration\nof the Pioneer spacecraft and for the alleged missing mass in spiral galaxies\nand other astrophysical objects. The third effect can be used to propose a\nnon-cosmological explanation of high redshifts of quasars and gamma-ray bursts.\n"}

We show how the arrival\nand departure rates directly limit the capacity for message streams to be\nbroadcast to all other peers, by deriving mean field models that accurately\ndescribe the system behavior. Our models cover the unit and more general k\nbuffer cases, i.e. where a peer can buffer at most k messages at any one time,\nand we give results for both single and multi-source message streams.

{"text":"  The driving mechanism of jets and outflows in star formation process is\nstudied using resistive MHD nested grid simulations.

High-velocity\nflows are enclosed by low-velocity flows after protostar formation. The\ndifference in the degree of collimation between the two flows is caused by the\nstrength of the magnetic field and configuration of the magnetic field lines.\nThe magnetic field around an adiabatic core is strong and has an hourglass\nconfiguration; therefore, flows from the adiabatic core are driven mainly by\nthe magnetocentrifugal mechanism and guided by the hourglass-like field lines.\nIn contrast, the magnetic field around the protostar is weak and has a straight\nconfiguration owing to Ohmic dissipation in the high-density gas region.\nTherefore, flows from the protostar are driven mainly by the magnetic pressure\ngradient force and guided by straight field lines. Differing depth of the\ngravitational potential between the adiabatic core and the protostar cause the\ndifference of the flow speed. Low-velocity flows correspond to the observed\nmolecular outflows, while high-velocity flows correspond to the observed\noptical jets.

{"text":"  Random networks with specified degree distributions have been proposed as\nrealistic models of population structure, yet the problem of dynamically\nmodeling SIR-type epidemics in random networks remains complex. I resolve this\ndilemma by showing how the SIR dynamics can be modeled with a system of three\nnonlinear ODE's. The method makes use of the probability generating function\n(PGF) formalism for representing the degree distribution of a random network\nand makes use of network-centric quantities such as the number of edges in a\nwell-defined category rather than node-centric quantities such as the number of\ninfecteds or susceptibles. The PGF provides a simple means of translating\nbetween network and node-centric variables and determining the epidemic\nincidence at any time. The theory also provides a simple means of tracking the\nevolution of the degree distribution among susceptibles or infecteds. The\nequations are used to demonstrate the dramatic effects that the degree\ndistribution plays on the final size of an epidemic as well as the speed with\nwhich it spreads through the population. Power law degree distributions are\nobserved to generate an almost immediate expansion phase yet have a smaller\nfinal size compared to homogeneous degree distributions such as the Poisson.\nThe equations are compared to stochastic simulations, which show good agreement\nwith the theory.

The relation between spectral slope and flux (the spectrum\ngets bluer as the source flux increases) is well described by a power-law\nmodel, although there is significant scatter around the best-fitting model\nline.

{"text":"  Systematic description of a spin one-half system endowed with magnetic moment\nor any other two-level system (qubit) interacting with the quantized\nelectromagnetic field is developed. This description exploits a close analogy\nbetween a two-level system and the Dirac electron that comes to light when the\ntwo-level system is described within the formalism of second quantization in\nterms of fermionic creation and annihilation operators. The analogy enables one\nto introduce all the powerful tools of relativistic QED (albeit in a greatly\nsimplified form). The Feynman diagrams and the propagators turn out to be very\nuseful. In particular, the QED concept of the vacuum polarization finds its\nclose counterpart in the photon scattering off a two level-system leading via\nthe linear response theory to the general formulas for the atomic\npolarizability and the dynamic single spin susceptibility. To illustrate the\nusefulness of these methods, we calculate the polarizability and susceptibility\nup to the fourth order of perturbation theory. These {\\em ab initio}\ncalculations resolve some ambiguities concerning the sign prescription and the\noptical damping that arise in the phenomenological treatment. We also show that\nthe methods used to study two-level systems (qubits) can be extended to\nmany-level systems (qudits). As an example, we describe the interaction with\nthe quantized electromagnetic field of an atom with four relevant states: one S\nstate and three degenerate P states.\n"}
{"text":"  We show that dynamical relaxation in the aftermath of a galactic merger and\nthe ensuing formation and decay of a binary massive black hole (MBH), are\ndominated by massive perturbers (MPs) such as giant molecular clouds or\nclusters. MPs accelerate relaxation by orders of magnitude relative to 2-body\nstellar relaxation alone, and efficiently scatter stars into the binary MBH's\norbit. The 3-body star-binary MBH interactions shrink the binary MBH to the\npoint where energy losses from the emission of gravitational waves (GW) lead to\nrapid coalescence. We model this process based on observed and simulated MP\ndistributions and take into account the decreased efficiency of the star-binary\nMBH interaction due to acceleration in the galactic potential. We show that\nmergers of gas-rich galactic nuclei lead to binary MBH coalescence well within\nthe Hubble time. Moreover, lower-mass binary MBHs (<10^8 Msun) require only a\nfew percent of the typical gas mass in a post-merger nucleus to coalesce in a\nHubble time. The fate of a binary MBH in a gas poor galactic merger is less\ncertain, although massive stellar structures (e.g. clusters, stellar rings)\ncould likewise lead to efficient coalescence. These coalescence events are\nobservable by their strong GW emission. MPs thus increase the cosmic rate of\nsuch GW events, lead to a higher mass deficit in the merged galactic core and\nsuppress the formation of triple MBH systems and the resulting ejection of MBHs\ninto intergalactic space.\n"}

But the metallic phase is\nnot stable in one dimension: as the temperature is reduced, the electronic\ncharge and spin tend to arrange themselves in an ordered fashion due to strong\ncorrelations. The competition of the different interactions is responsible for\nwhich broken-symmetry ground state is eventually realized in a specific\ncompound and which drives the system towards an insulating state.\n  Here we review the various ordering phenomena and how they can be identified\nby optic and magnetic measurements. While the final results might look very\nsimilar in the case of a charge density wave and a charge-ordered metal, for\ninstance, the physical cause is completely different. When density waves form,\na gap opens in the density of states at the Fermi energy due to nesting of the\none-dimension Fermi surface sheets. When a one-dimensional metal becomes a\ncharge-ordered Mott insulator, on the other hand, the short-range Coulomb\nrepulsion localizes the charge on the lattice sites and even causes certain\ncharge patterns.\n  We try to point out the similarities and conceptional differences of these\nphenomena and give an example for each of them.

{"text":"  It is conjectured that time intervals of any kind are proportional to the age\nof the Universe taken at the time we are considering the interval.

Nonconservation of energy\nfollows from the condition that any time interval is proportional to the\ncosmological time, and therefore time can not be homogeneous. From the\nuncertainty principle, taking the constant of Planck as a real constant, time\nindependent, it follows that any energy in the Universe decreases linearly with\ntime.

The future of the Universe gives for the wave functions\na long sinusoidal spatial solution, so that everything becomes unlocalized.

{"text":"  We discuss a numerical model for black hole growth and its associated\nfeedback processes that for the first time allows cosmological simulations of\nstructure formation to self-consistently follow the build up of the cosmic\npopulation of galaxies and active galactic nuclei. Our model assumes that seed\nblack holes are present at early cosmic epochs at the centres of forming halos.\nWe then track their growth from gas accretion and mergers with other black\nholes in the course of cosmic time. For black holes that are active, we\ndistinguish between two distinct modes of feedback, depending on the black hole\naccretion rate itself. Black holes that accrete at high rates are assumed to be\nin a `quasar regime', where we model their feedback by thermally coupling a\nsmall fraction of their bolometric luminosity to the surrounding gas. For black\nholes with low accretion rates, we conjecture that most of their feedback\noccurs in mechanical form, where AGN-driven bubbles are injected into a gaseous\nenvironment. Using our new model, we carry out TreeSPH cosmological simulations\non the scales of individual galaxies to those of massive galaxy clusters, both\nfor isolated systems and for cosmological boxes. We demonstrate that our model\nproduces results for the black hole and stellar mass densities in broad\nagreement with observational constraints. We find that the black holes\nsignificantly influence the evolution of their host galaxies, changing their\nstar formation history, their amount of cold gas, and their colours.

The overall\nbehavior is mainly determined by the c-axis and in-plane dissipation\nparameters, which is inversely proportional to the anisotropy. The cases of\nweak and strong dissipation are realized in\n$\\mathrm{Bi_{2}Sr_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{x}}$ and underdoped $\\mathrm{YBa_{2}Cu_{3}\nO_{x}}$ correspondingly.

The corresponding mass of CB190 is ~10 Msun. Our 12CO and 13CO J =\n2-1 data over a 10 arcmin X 10 arcmin region centered on the shadow show a\ntemperature ~10 K. The thermal continuum indicates a similar temperature for\nthe dust.

The latter is an analytical model in which the viscous torque\nis assumed to vanish at the ISCO. We consider the implications of the results\nfor attempts to estimate black hole spin by using the standard disk model to\nfit continuum spectra of black hole accretion disks. We find that the error in\nthe spin estimate is quite modest so long as H\/R < 0.1 and alpha < 0.2.

This\nrefinement equation generates a MRA. The case $p=2$ is studied in detail. Our\nMRA is a 2-adic analog of the real Haar MRA. But in contrast to the real\nsetting, the refinable function generating our Haar MRA is 1-periodic, which\nnever holds for real refinable functions. This fact implies that there exist\ninfinity many different 2-adic orthonormal wavelet bases in ${\\cL}^2(\\bQ_2)$\ngenerated by the same Haar MRA. All of these bases are described. We also\nconstructed multidimensional 2-adic Haar orthonormal bases for\n${\\cL}^2(\\bQ_2^n)$ by means of the tensor product of one-dimensional MRAs. A\ncriterion for a multidimensional $p$-adic wavelet to be an eigenfunction for a\npseudo-differential operator is derived. We proved also that these wavelets are\neigenfunctions of the Taibleson multidimensional fractional operator. These\nfacts create the necessary prerequisites for intensive using our bases in\napplications.\n"}

{"text":"  Having already reported on the first photometric study of the\nintermediate-age open cluster NGC 1883 (Carraro et al. 2003), we present in\nthis paper the first spectroscopic multi-epoch investigation of a sample of\nevolved stars in the same cluster. The aim is to derive the cluster membership,\nvelocity and metallicity, and discuss recent claims in the literature (Tadross\n2005) that NGC 1883 is as metal poor as globular clusters in the Halo. Besides,\nbeing one of the few outer Galactic disk intermediate-age open clusters known\nso far, it is an ideal target to improve our knowledge of the Galactic disk\nradial abundance gradient, that is a basic ingredient for any chemical\nevolution model of the Milky Way. The new data we obtained allow us to put NGC\n1883's basic parameters more reliable. We find that the cluster has a mean\nmetallicity of [Fe\/H] = -0.20$\\pm$0.22, from which we infer an age\n(650$^{+70}_{-70}$ Myr) close to the Hyades one and a Galactocentric distance\nof 12.3$^{+0.4}_{-0.2}$ kpc. The metal abundance, kinematics, and position make\nNGC 1883 a genuine outer disk intermediate-age open cluster. We confirm that in\nthe outer Galactic disk the abundance gradient is shallower than in the solar\nvicinity.\n"}
{"text":"  The continuum intensity at wavelengths around 1 mm provides an excellent way\nto probe the solar chromosphere. Future high-resolution millimetre arrays, such\nas the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), will thus produce valuable input\nfor the ongoing controversy on the thermal structure and the dynamics of this\nlayer. Synthetic brightness temperature maps are calculated on basis of\nthree-dimensional radiation (magneto-)hydrodynamic (MHD) simulations. While the\nmillimetre continuum at 0.3mm originates mainly from the upper photosphere, the\nlonger wavelengths considered here map the low and middle chromosphere. The\neffective formation height increases generally with wavelength and also from\ndisk-centre towards the solar limb. The average intensity contribution\nfunctions are usually rather broad and in some cases they are even\ndouble-peaked as there are contributions from hot shock waves and cool\npost-shock regions in the model chromosphere. Taking into account the\ndeviations from ionisation equilibrium for hydrogen gives a less strong\nvariation of the electron density and with it of the optical depth. The result\nis a narrower formation height range. The average brightness temperature\nincreases with wavelength and towards the limb. The relative contrast depends\non wavelength in the same way as the average intensity but decreases towards\nthe limb. The dependence of the brightness temperature distribution on\nwavelength and disk-position can be explained with the differences in formation\nheight and the variation of temperature fluctuations with height in the model\natmospheres.\n"}

{"text":"  In the classical one-dimensional solution of fluid dynamics equations all\nunknown functions depend only on time t and Cartesian coordinate x.

Basing on\nthe symmetry analysis of differential equations we propose generalization of\nthis solution allowing movements in different directions of fluid particles\nbelonging to plane x=const. At that, all functions but an angle determining the\ndirection of particle's motion depend on t and x only, whereas the angle\ndepends on all coordinates. In this solution the whole picture of motion\nsuperposes from identical trajectories placed under different angles in 3D\nspace.

These simple mass loss prescriptions are nontheless\nused in many models of stellar evolution without much consideration of their\napplicability in various cases. We present here an on-going project aiming at a\nbetter description of the mass loss, that could be used to improve stellar\nevolution models -- especially the evolution during the TP-AGB phase. As a\nfirst step, we have considered the mass loss evolution during a He-shell flash.\nUsing stellar parameters sampled from a stellar evolutionary track, we have\ncomputed the time evolution of the atmospheric layers and wind acceleration\nregion during a flash event with detailed frequency-dependent\nradiation-hydrodynamical models including dust formation. Based on these\nresults, we have also simulated the subsequent long-term dynamical evolution of\nthe circumstellar envelope (CSE), including the formation of a detached shell.\nWe find that existing simple mass loss prescriptions imply different mass loss\nevolutions compared with our model. The second step of the project deals with\nthe dependence of mass loss on the basic stellar parameters. At the moment we\nare computing a large grid of wind models for C-rich AGB stars. Preliminary\nresults show that simple parameterisations are difficult to obtain in certain\nregions of the parameter space considered, due to strong non-linearities in the\nwind mechanism.\n"}
{"text":"  We analyze the generalization performance of a student in a model composed of\nnonlinear perceptrons: a true teacher, ensemble teachers, and the student.

{"text":"  Determinations of beryllium abundance in stars, together with lithium,\nprovide a key tool to investigate the so far poorly understood extra-mixing\nprocesses at work in stellar interiors. We measured Be in three open\nclusters,complementing existing Be surveys, and aiming at gathering a more\ncomplete empirical scenario of the evolution of Be as a function of stellar age\nand temperature. Specifically, we analyzed VLT\/UVES spectra of members of NGC\n2516, the Hyades, and M 67 to determine their Be and Li abundances. In the\nfirst two clusters we focused on stars cooler than 5400 K, while the M 67\nsample includes stars warmer than 6150 K, as well as two subgiants and two blue\nstragglers. We also computed the evolution of Be for a 0.9 Mo star based on\nstandard evolutionary models. We find different emprical behaviours for stars\nin different temperature bins and ages. Stars warmer than 6150 K show Be\ndepletion and follow a Be vs. Li correlation while Be is undepleted in stars in\nthe ~6150-5600 K range. NGC 2516 members cooler than 5400 K have not depleted\nany Be, but older Hyades of similar temperature do show some depletion. Be is\nseverely depleted in the subgiants and blue stragglers. The results for warm\nstars are in agreement with previous studies, supporting the hypothesis that\nmixing in this temperature regime is driven by rotation. The same holds for the\ntwo subgiants that have evolved from the \"Li gap\". This mechanism is instead\nnot the dominant one for solar-type stars. We show that Be depletion of cool\nHyades cannot simply be explained by the effect of increasing depth of the\nconvective zone. Finally, the different Be content of the two blue stragglers\nsuggests that they have formed by two different processes (i.e., collisions vs.\nbinary merging).\n"}
{"text":"  Recent results from the HESS gamma ray telescope have shown the presence of\nboth a diffuse, extended, flux of gamma rays above ~0.4 TeV and discrete\nsources in and near the Galactic Centre.

Prominent features are the need for 'anomalous diffusion' of the\nprotons in the whole region and the adoption of low efficiency for SNR\nacceleration in the high density regions. The latter is related by us to the\nwell-known low 'cosmic ray gradient' in the Galaxy.

{"text":"  We propose a subtraction scheme for a massive Yang-Mills theory realized via\na nonlinear representation of the gauge group (here SU(2)). It is based on the\nsubtraction of the poles in D-4 of the amplitudes, in dimensional\nregularization, after a suitable normalization has been performed. Perturbation\ntheory is in the number of loops and the procedure is stable under iterative\nsubtraction of the poles. The unphysical Goldstone bosons, the Faddeev-Popov\nghosts and the unphysical mode of the gauge field are expected to cancel out in\nthe unitarity equation. The spontaneous symmetry breaking parameter is not a\nphysical variable. We use the tools already tested in the nonlinear sigma\nmodel: hierarchy in the number of Goldstone boson legs and weak power-counting\nproperty (finite number of independent divergent amplitudes at each order). It\nis intriguing that the model is naturally based on the symmetry SU(2)_L local\ntimes SU(2)_R global.

A renormalization group transformation appropriate to\nthe nonequilibrium problem is defined. An important feature is the presence in\nthe model of a new coupling, essentially the decoherence rate, which acquires\nan additive renormalization similar to that of the energy in equilibrium\nproblems. The method is used to study interplay between the dephasing-induced\nformation of independent resonances tied to the two chemical potentials and the\ndecoherence which cuts off the scaling and leads to effectively classical\nlong-time behavior.

{"text":"  We study the effect of continuous quantum error correction in the case where\neach qubit in a codeword is subject to a general Hamiltonian interaction with\nan independent bath.

We then study the model of a bit-flip code with each\nqubit coupled to an independent bath qubit and subject to continuous\ncorrection, and find its solution. We show that for sufficiently large\nerror-correction rates, the encoded state approximately follows an evolution of\nthe type of a single decohering qubit, but with an effectively decreased\ncoupling constant. The factor by which the coupling constant is decreased\nscales quadratically with the error-correction rate. This is compared to the\ncase of Markovian noise, where the decoherence rate is effectively decreased by\na factor which scales only linearly with the rate of error correction. The\nquadratic enhancement depends on the existence of a Zeno regime in the\nHamiltonian evolution which is absent in purely Markovian dynamics. We analyze\nthe range of validity of this result and identify two relevant time scales.\nFinally, we extend the result to more general codes and argue that the\nperformance of continuous error correction will exhibit the same qualitative\ncharacteristics.\n"}

{"text":"  Some specific features and extensions of the continuous time random walk\n(CTRW) approach are analyzed in detail within the Markovian representation (MR)\nand CTRW-based non-Markovian stochastic Liouville equation (SLE).

In this\nrepresentation the probability distribution function (PDF) W(t) of fluctuation\nrenewals is associated with that of reoccurrences in a certain jump state of\nsome Markovian controlling process. Within the MR the non-Markovian SLE, which\ndescribes the effect of CTRW-like noise on relaxation of dynamic and stochastic\nsystems, is generalized to take into account the influence of relaxing systems\non statistical properties of noise. The generalized non-Markovian SLE is\napplied to study two modifications of the CTRW approach. One of them considers\nthe cascaded CTRWs in which the controlling process is actually CTRW-like one\ncontrolled by another CTRW process, controlled in turn by the third one, etc.\nWithin the MR simple expression for the PDF W(t) of total controlling process\nis obtained in terms of Markovian variants of controlling PDFs in the cascade.\nThe expression is shown to be especially simple and instructive in the case of\nanomalous processes determined by long time tailed W(t). The cascaded CTRWs can\nmodel the effect of complexity of a system on relaxation kinetics (in glasses,\nfractals, branching media, ultrametric structures, etc.).

To do so,\nit shows that any preserved involution $\\sigma$ of the adjoint bundle $\\mc{A}$\ngives rise, given certain algebraic conditions, to a unique preferred affine\nconnection $\\nabla$ with covariantly constant rho-tensor $\\mathsf{P}$,\ncompatible with the algebraic bracket on $\\mc{A}$. These conditions can\nreasonably be considered the generalisations of the Einstein condition, and\nrecreate the standard Einstein condition in conformal geometry. The existence\nof such an involution is implies by some simpler structures: preserved metrics\nwhen the overall algebra $\\mf{g}$ is $\\mf{sl}(m,\\mbb{F})$, preserved complex\nstructures anti-commuting with the skew-form for $\\mf{g}=\\mf{sp}(2m,\\mbb{F})$,\nand preserved subundles of the tangent bundle, of a certain rank, for all the\nother non-exceptional simple Lie algebras. Examples of Einstein involutions are\nconstructed or referenced for several geometries. The existence of cone\nconstructions for certain Einstein involutions is then demonstrated.\n"}
{"text":"  Optical microresonators have recently attracted a growing attention in the\nphotonics community. Their applications range from quantum electro-dynamics to\nsensors and filtering devices for optical telecommunication systems, where they\nare likely to become an essential building block. The integration of nonlinear\nand electro-optical properties in the resonators represents a very stimulating\nchallenge, as it would incorporate new and more advanced functionality. Lithium\nniobate is an excellent candidate material, being an established choice for\nelectro-optic and nonlinear optical applications. Here we report on the first\nrealization of optical microring resonators in submicrometric thin films of\nlithium niobate. The high index contrast films are produced by an improved\ncrystal ion slicing and bonding technique using benzocyclobutene. The rings\nhave radius R=100 um and their transmission spectrum has been tuned using the\nelectro-optic effect. These results open new perspectives for the use of\nlithium niobate in chip-scale integrated optical devices and nonlinear optical\nmicrocavities.\n"}
{"text":"  In 1929 Heisenberg and Pauli laid the foundations of QFT by quantizing the\nfields (method of canonical quantization). This general theory of quantized\nfields has remained undisputed up to now. We show how the unmodified\nHeisenberg-Pauli calculations make sense mathematically by using a theory of\ngeneralized functions adapted to nonlinear operations. By providing an\nappropriate mathematical setting, nonlinear generalized functions open doors\nfor their understanding but there remains presumably very hard technical\nproblems. (i) Domains of the interacting field operators: a priori the H-P\ncalculations give time dependent dense domains, what is not very convenient;\n(ii) Calculations of the resulting matrix elements of the S operator: from the\nunitarity of the S operator as a whole there are no longer ``infinities,'' but\na priori there is no other hope than heavy computer calculations; (iii)\nConnection with renormalization theory: it should provide an approximation when\nthe coupling constant is small. The aim of this paper is to present, on the\ngrounds of a standard mathematical model of QFT (a self interacting scalar\nboson field), a basis for improvement without significant prerequisites in\nmathematics and physics. It is an attempt to use nonlinear generalized\nfunctions in QFT, starting directly from the calculations made by physicists,\nin the same way as they have already been used in classical mechanics and\ngeneral relativity.\n"}
{"text":"  We compute the reduced genus 1 Gromov-Witten invariants of Calabi-Yau\nhypersurfaces. As a consequence, we confirm the 1993 Bershadsky-Cecotti\nOoguri-Vafa (BCOV) prediction for the standard genus 1 GW-invariants of a\nquintic threefold. We combine constructions from a series of previous papers\nwith the classical localization theorem to relate the reduced genus 1\ninvariants of a CY-hypersurface to previously computed integrals on moduli\nspaces of stable genus 0 maps into projective space. The resulting, rather\nunwieldy, expressions for a genus 1 equivariant generating function simplify\ndrastically, using a regularity property of a genus 0 equivariant generating\nfunction in half of the cases. Finally, by disregarding terms that cannot\neffect the non-equivariant part of the former, we relate the answer to an\nexplicit hypergeometric series in a simple way. The approach described in this\npaper is systematic. It is directly applicable to computing reduced genus 1\nGW-invariants of other complete intersections and should apply to higher-genus\nlocalization computations.\n"}
{"text":"  Photon-induced reactions play a key role in the nucleosynthesis of rare\nneutron-deficient p-nuclei. The paper focuses on (gamma,alpha), (gamma,p), and\n(gamma,n) reactions which define the corresponding p-process path. The relation\nbetween stellar reaction rates and laboratory cross sections is analyzed for\nphoton-induced reactions and their inverse capture reactions to evaluate\nvarious experimental approaches. An improved version S_C(E) of the\nastrophysical S-factor is suggested which is based on the Coulomb wave\nfunctions. S_C(E) avoids the apparent energy dependence which is otherwise\nobtained for capture reactions on heavy nuclei. It is found that a special type\nof synchrotron radiation available at SPring-8 that mimics stellar blackbody\nradiation at billions of Kelvin is a promising tool for future experiments. By\nusing the blackbody synchrotron radiation, sufficient event rates for\n(gamma,alpha) and (gamma,p) reactions in the p-process path can be expected.\nThese experiments will provide data to improve the nuclear parameters involved\nin the statistical model and thus reduce the uncertainties of nucleosynthesis\ncalculations.\n"}
{"text":"  Initiated by Gromov, the study of holomorphic curves in symplectic manifolds\nhas been a powerfull tool in symplectic topology, however the moduli space of\nholomorphic curves is often very difficult to find. A common technique is to\nstudy the limiting behavior of holomorphic curves in a degenerating family of\ncomplex structures which corresponds to a kind of adiabatic limit. The category\nof exploded fibrations is an extension of the smooth category in which some of\nthese degenerations can be described as smooth families.\n  The first part of this paper is devoted to defining exploded fibrations and a\nslightly more specialized category of exploded torus fibrations. Later sections\ncontain the transverse interesction theory for exploded fibrations and some\nexamples of holomorphic curves in exploded torus fibrations, including a brief\ndiscussion of the relationship between tropical geometry and exploded torus\nfibrations. In the final section, the perturbation theory of holomorphic curves\nin exploded torus fibrations is sketched.\n"}
{"text":"  Heterogeneous materials abound in nature and man-made situations. Examples\ninclude porous media, biological materials, and composite materials. Diverse\nand interesting properties exhibited by these materials result from their\ncomplex microstructures, which also make it difficult to model the materials.\nIn this first part of a series of two papers, we collect the known necessary\nconditions on the standard two-point correlation function S2(r) and formulate a\nnew conjecture. In particular, we argue that given a complete two-point\ncorrelation function space, S2(r) of any statistically homogeneous material can\nbe expressed through a map on a selected set of bases of the function space. We\nprovide new examples of realizable two-point correlation functions and suggest\na set of analytical basis functions. Moreover, we devise an efficient and\nisotropy- preserving construction algorithm, namely, the Lattice-Point\nalgorithm to generate realizations of materials from their two- point\ncorrelation functions based on the Yeong-Torquato technique. Subsequent\nanalysis can be performed on the generated images to obtain desired macroscopic\nproperties. These developments are integrated here into a general scheme that\nenables one to model and categorize heterogeneous materials via two-point\ncorrelation functions.\n"}
{"text":"  Sphere decoding (SD) is a low complexity maximum likelihood (ML) detection\nalgorithm, which has been adapted for different linear channels in digital\ncommunications. The complexity of the SD has been shown to be exponential in\nsome cases, and polynomial in others and under certain assumptions. The sphere\nradius and the number of nodes visited throughout the tree traversal search are\nthe decisive factors for the complexity of the algorithm. The radius problem\nhas been addressed and treated widely in the literature. In this paper, we\npropose a new structure for SD, which drastically reduces the overall\ncomplexity. The complexity is measured in terms of the floating point\noperations per second (FLOPS) and the number of nodes visited throughout the\nalgorithm tree search. This reduction in the complexity is due to the ability\nof decoding the real and imaginary parts of each jointly detected symbol\nindependently of each other, making use of the new lattice representation. We\nfurther show by simulations that the new approach achieves 80% reduction in the\noverall complexity compared to the conventional SD for a 2x2 system, and almost\n50% reduction for the 4x4 and 6x6 cases, thus relaxing the requirements for\nhardware implementation.\n"}

{"text":"  (abridged abstract) We present an analysis of the stellar mass growth over\nthe last 10 Gyrs using a large 3.6$\\mu$ selected sample. We split our sample\ninto active (blue) and quiescent (red) galaxies. Our measurements of the K-LFs\nand LD evolution support the idea that a large fraction of galaxies is already\nassembled at $z\\sim 1.2$. Based on the analysis of the evolution of the stellar\nmass-to-light ratio (in K-band) for the spectroscopic sub-sample, we derive the\nstellar mass density for the entire sample. We find that the global evolution\nof the stellar mass density is well reproduced by the star formation rate\nderived from UV dust corrected measurements. Over the last 8Gyrs, we observe\nthat the stellar mass density of the active population remains approximately\nconstant while it gradually increases for the quiescent population over the\nsame timescale. As a consequence, the growth of the stellar mass in the\nquiescent population must be due to the shutoff of star formation in active\ngalaxies that migrate into the quiescent population. From $z=2$ to $z=1.2$, we\nobserve a major build-up of the quiescent population with an increase by a\nfactor of 10 in stellar mass, suggesting that we are observing the epoch when\nan increasing fraction of galaxies are ending their star formation activity and\nstart to build up the red sequence.\n"}
{"text":"  We follow the changes in the structure of the accretion disk of the dwarf\nnova V2051 Oph along two separate outbursts in order to investigate the causes\nof its recurrent outbursts. We apply eclipse mapping techniques to a set of\nlight curves covering a normal (July 2000) and a low-amplitude (August 2002)\noutburst to derive maps of the disk surface brightness distribution at\ndifferent phases along the outburst cycles. The sequence of eclipse maps of the\n2000 July outburst reveal that the disk shrinks at outburst onset while an\nuneclipsed component of 13 per cent of the total light develops. The derived\nradial intensity distributions suggest the presence of an outward-moving\nheating wave during rise and of an inward-moving cooling wave during decline.\nThe inferred speed of the outward-moving heating wave is ~ 1.6 km\/s, while the\nspeed of the cooling wave is a fraction of that. A comparison of the measured\ncooling wave velocity on consecutive nights indicates that the cooling wave\naccelerates as it travels towards disk center, in contradiction with the\nprediction of the disk instability model. From the inferred speed of the\nheating wave we derive a viscosity parameter alpha_{hot} ~ 0.13, comparable to\nthe measured viscosity parameter in quiescence. The 2002 August outburst had\nlower amplitude (\\Delta B ~ 0.8 mag) and the disk at outburst maximum was\nsmaller than on 2000 July. For an assumed distance of 92 pc, we find that along\nboth outbursts the disk brightness temperatures remain below the minimum\nexpected according to the disk instability model. The results suggest that the\noutbursts of V2051 Oph are caused by bursts of increased mass transfer from the\nmass-donor star.\n"}
{"text":"  We consider a brane world in an arbitrary number of dimensions without Z_2\nsymmetry and derive the effective Einstein equation on the brane, where its\nright-hand side is given by the matter on the brane and the curvature in the\nbulk. This is achieved by first deriving the junction conditions for a non-Z_2\nsymmetric brane and second solving the Gauss equation, which relates the mean\nextrinsic curvature of the brane to the curvature in the bulk, with respect to\nthe mean extrinsic curvature. The latter corresponds to formulating an explicit\njunction condition on the mean of the extrinsic curvature, analogue to the\nIsrael junction condition for the jump of the extrinsic curvature. We find that\nthere appears a new type of an effective anisotropic fluid on the right-hand\nside of the effective Einstein equation due to the fact that there is no Z_2\nsymmetry.

{"text":"  When modeling the distribution of a set of data by a mixture of Gaussians,\nthere are two possibilities: i) the classical one is using a set of parameters\nwhich are the proportions, the means and the variances; ii) the second is to\nconsider the proportions as the probabilities of a discrete valued hidden\nvariable. In the first case a usual prior distribution for the proportions is\nthe Dirichlet which accounts for the fact that they have to sum up to one. In\nthe second case, to each data is associated a hidden variable for which we\nconsider two possibilities: a) assuming those variables to be i.i.d.

{"text":"  Utilizing an eigenfunction decomposition, we study the growth and spectra of\nenergy in the vortical and wave modes of a 3D rotating stratified fluid as a\nfunction of $\\epsilon = f\/N$.

A large number of independent\nobservations have shown that the rotational velocities of test particles\ngravitating around galaxies tend, as a function of the distance from the\ngalactic center, toward constant values. By assuming a constant tangential\nvelocity, the general solution of the vacuum gravitational field equations on\nthe brane can be obtained in an exact analytic form. This allows us to obtain\nthe explicit form of the projections of the bulk Weyl tensor on the brane, and\nthe equation of state of the dark pressure as a function of the dark radiation.\nThe physical and geometrical quantities are expressed in terms of\nobservable\/measurable parameters, like the tangential velocity, the baryonic\nmass and the radius of the galaxy. We also analyze the dynamics of test\nparticles by using methods from the qualitative analysis of dynamical systems,\nby assuming a simple linear equation of state for the dark pressure. The\nobtained results provide a theoretical framework for the observational testing\nat the extra-galactic scale of the predictions of the brane world models.\n"}
{"text":"  Technological innovation has extensively been studied to make firms\nsustainable and more competitive. Within this context, the most important\nrecent issue has been the dynamics of collaborative innovation among firms. We\ntherefore investigated a patent network, especially focusing on its spatial\ncharacteristics. The results can be summarized as follows. (1) The degree\ndistribution in a patent network follows a power law. A firm can then be\nconnected to many firms via hubs connected to the firm. (2) The neighbors'\naverage degree has a null correlation, but the clustering coefficient has a\nnegative correlation. The latter means that there is a hierarchical structure\nand bridging different modules may shorten the paths between the nodes in them.\n(3) The distance of links not only indicates the regional accumulations of\nfirms, but the importance of time it takes to travel, which plays a key role in\ncreating links. (4) The ratio of internal links in cities indicates that we\nhave to consider the existing links firms have to facilitate the creation of\nnew links.\n"}
{"text":"  HD 52265 is the only known exoplanet-host star selected as a main target for\nthe seismology programme of the CoRoT satellite.

This star was misclassified as a giant\nin the Bright Star Catalog, while it is more probably on the main-sequence or\nat the beginning of the subgiant branch. We performed an extensive analysis of\nthis star, showing how asteroseismology may lead to a precise determination of\nits external parameters and internal structure. We first reviewed the\nobservational constraints on the metallicity, the gravity and the effective\ntemperature derived from the spectroscopic observations of HD 52265. We also\nderived its luminosity using the Hipparcos parallax. We computed the\nevolutionary tracks for models of various metallicities which cross the\nrelevant observational error boxes in the gravity-effective temperature plane.\nWe selected eight different stellar models which satisfy the observational\nconstraints, computed their p-modes frequencies and analysed specific seismic\ntests. The possible models for HD 52265, which satisfy the constraints derived\nfrom the spectroscopic observations, are different in both their external and\ninternal parameters. They lie either on the main sequence or at the beginning\nof the subgiant branch. The differences in the models lead to quite different\nproperties of their oscillation frequencies.

{"text":"  We study the induced odd-frequency pairing states in ballistic normal\nmetal\/superconductor (N\/S) junctions where a superconductor has even-frequency\nsymmetry in the bulk and a normal metal layer has an arbitrary length. Using\nthe quasiclassical Green's function formalism, we demonstrate that, quite\ngenerally, the pair amplitude in the junction has an admixture of an\nodd-frequency component due to the breakdown of translational invariance near\nthe N\/S interface where the pair potential acquires spatial dependence. If a\nsuperconductor has even-parity pair potential (spin-singlet s-wave state), the\nodd-frequency pairing component with odd-parity is induced near the N\/S\ninterface, while in the case of odd-parity pair potential (spin-triplet\n$p_{x}$-wave or spin-singlet $d_{xy}$-wave) the odd-frequency component with\neven-parity is generated. We show that in conventional s-wave junctions, the\namplitude of the odd-frequency pairing state is enhanced at energies\ncorresponding to the peaks in the local density of states (LDOS). In $p_x$- and\n$d_{xy}$-wave junctions, the amplitude of the odd-frequency component on the S\nside of the N\/S interface is enhanced at zero energy where the midgap Andreev\nresonant state (MARS) appears due to the sign change of the pair potential.

{"text":"  Using data recorded by the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) instrument on the\nSolar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), we have traced 123 pairs of opposite\nmagnetic polarity moving magnetic features (MMFs) in three active regions NOAA\nARs 8375, 0330 and 9575. At the time of observation, AR 8375 was young, AR 0330\nmature, and AR 9575 decaying. The vertical velocity indicates that the elements\nof MMF pairs with polarity opposite to that of the sunspot support a downflow\nof around 50-100 m s$^{-1}$. The average Doppler shift difference between\nnegative and positive elements of an MMF pair is about 150 m s$^{-1}$ in AR\n8375, 100 m s$^{-1}$ in AR 0330, and 20 m s$^{-1}$ in AR 9575. These\nobservational results are in agreement with the model that MMF pairs are part\nof a U-loop emanating from the sunspot's magnetic canopy. According to this\nmodel the downflow is caused by the Evershed flow returning below the solar\nsurface. For AR 8375, the horizontal velocity of MMFs ranges from 0.1 km\ns$^{-1}$ to 0.7 km s$^{-1}$, and on average, the velocity of an MMF pair\ndecreases significantly (from 0.6 km s$^{-1}$ to 0.35 km s$^{-1}$) with\nincreasing distance from the MMF's birth place. This result suggests that the\nchange in MMF flow speed does not reflect the radial structure of the moat\nflow, but rather is intrinsic to the evolution of the MMF pairs. This result is\nalso in agreement with the U-loop model of MMF pairs. We also find that\nproperties of MMF pairs, most strikingly the lifetime, depend on the evolution\nstages of the parent sunspot. The mean lifetimes of MMF pairs in ARs 9575 and\n0330 are 0.7 hours and 1.6 hours, respectively, which is considerably shorter\nthan the 4 hours lifetime previously found for AR 8375.\n"}

Part 2 describes some of the\napproaches to understand the nature of the cosmological constant and attempts\nto extract the key ingredients which must be present in any viable solution. I\nargue that (i)the cosmological constant problem cannot be satisfactorily solved\nuntil gravitational action is made invariant under the shift of the matter\nlagrangian by a constant and (ii) this cannot happen if the metric is the\ndynamical variable. Hence the cosmological constant problem essentially has to\ndo with our (mis)understanding of the nature of gravity. Part 3 discusses an\nalternative perspective on gravity in which the action is explicitly invariant\nunder the above transformation.

The size distribution of voids in the range\n5-70 Angstrom (corresponding to physical sizes of approximately 3-35 comoving\nMpc\/h) is consistent with the standard model for the Lyman alpha forest without\nadditional hot bubbles. We adapt a physical model for HII bubble growth during\ncosmological reionization (Furlanetto, Zaldarriaga and Hernquist 2004), to\ndescribe the expected size-distribution of hot super-bubbles at redshift around\nz = 3. This model incorporates the conjoining of bubbles around individual\nneighboring galaxies. Using the non-detection of voids, we find that models in\nwhich the volume filling factor of hot bubbles exceeds approximately 20 percent\nat z=3 can be ruled out, primarily because they overproduce the number of large\n(40-50 Angstrom) voids. We conclude that any pre-heating mechanism that\nexplains galaxy cluster observations must avoid heating the low-density gas in\nthe proto-cluster regions, either by operating relatively recently (z<3) or by\ndepositing entropy in the high-density regions.\n"}

Although direct evidence for cosmic-ray ions in the ICM is still\nlacking, they produce gamma-ray emission through the decay of neutral pions\nproduced in their collisions with ICM nucleons. We investigate the capability\nof the Gamma-ray Large Area Space Telescope (GLAST) and imaging atmospheric\nCerenkov telescopes (IACTs) for constraining the cosmic-ray pressure\ncontribution to the ICM. We show that GLAST can be used to place stringent\nupper limits, a few per cent for individual nearby rich clusters, on the ratio\nof pressures of the cosmic rays and thermal gas. We further show that it is\npossible to place tight (<~10%) constraints for distant (z <~ 0.25) clusters in\nthe case of hard spectrum, by stacking signals from samples of known clusters.\nThe GLAST limits could be made more precise with the constraint on the\ncosmic-ray spectrum potentially provided by IACTs.

We performed an initial experiment at the AWA (Argonne\nWakefield Accelerator) laboratory in 2003 and measured broadband microwave\nemission from air ionized via high energy electrons and photons. A follow-up\nexperiment at SLAC (Stanford Linear Accelerator Center) in summer of 2004\nconfirmed the major features of the previous AWA observations with better\nprecision and made additional measurements relevant to the calorimetric\ncapabilities of the method. Prompted by these results we built a prototype\ndetector using satellite television technology, and have made measurements\nindicating possible detection of cosmic ray extensive air showers. The method,\nif confirmed by experiments now in progress, could provide a high-duty cycle\ncomplement to current nitrogen fluorescence observations of UHECR, which are\nlimited to dark, clear nights.

{"text":"  We present a mathematically justifiable, computationally simple, sample\neigenvalue based procedure for estimating the number of high-dimensional\nsignals in white noise using relatively few samples. The main motivation for\nconsidering a sample eigenvalue based scheme is the computational simplicity\nand the robustness to eigenvector modelling errors which are can adversely\nimpact the performance of estimators that exploit information in the sample\neigenvectors.\n  There is, however, a price we pay by discarding the information in the sample\neigenvectors; we highlight a fundamental asymptotic limit of sample eigenvalue\nbased detection of weak\/closely spaced high-dimensional signals from a limited\nsample size. This motivates our heuristic definition of the effective number of\nidentifiable signals which is equal to the number of \"signal\" eigenvalues of\nthe population covariance matrix which exceed the noise variance by a factor\nstrictly greater than 1+sqrt(Dimensionality of the system\/Sample size). The\nfundamental asymptotic limit brings into sharp focus why, when there are too\nfew samples available so that the effective number of signals is less than the\nactual number of signals, underestimation of the model order is unavoidable (in\nan asymptotic sense) when using any sample eigenvalue based detection scheme,\nincluding the one proposed herein.

{"text":"  Motivation: Similarity-measure based clustering is a crucial problem\nappearing throughout scientific data analysis.

Albeit its proved power, AP in its\npresent form suffers from a number of drawbacks. The hard constraint of having\nexactly one exemplar per cluster restricts AP to classes of regularly shaped\nclusters, and leads to suboptimal performance, {\\it e.g.}, in analyzing gene\nexpression data. Results: This limitation can be overcome by relaxing the AP\nhard constraints. A new parameter controls the importance of the constraints\ncompared to the aim of maximizing the overall similarity, and allows to\ninterpolate between the simple case where each data point selects its closest\nneighbor as an exemplar and the original AP.

{"text":"  We present detailed results from performing general relativistic (GR)\nsimulations of stellar core collapse to a proto-neutron star, using a\nmicrophysical equation of state (EoS) as well as an approximate description of\ndeleptonization during the collapse phase. We show that for a wide variety of\nrotation rates and profiles the gravitational wave (GW) burst signals from the\ncore bounce are of a generic type, already known as Type I in the literature.\nIn addition, for most models the characteristic frequency of the GW burst\nsignal lies in a narrow range around approximately 718 Hz. In our systematic\nstudy, using both GR and Newtonian gravity, we identify, individually quantify,\nand discuss in detail the micro- and macrophysical mechanisms leading to this\nresult, i.e. the effects of rotation, the EoS, and deleptonization. We also\ndiscuss the detectability prospects of such GW burst signals by GW detectors,\nand infer that such a generic type of signal templates will likely facilitate a\nmore efficient search in current and future detectors of both interferometric\nand resonant type.\n"}
{"text":"  The data from a CO(1 - 0) mapping survey of 40 nearby spiral galaxies\nperformed with the Nobeyama 45-m telescope are presented. The criteria of the\nsample selection were (1) RC3 morphological type in the range Sa to Scd, (2)\ndistance less than 25 Mpc, (3) inclination angle less than 79deg (RC3), (4)\nflux at 100 um higher than ~ 10 Jy, (5) spiral structure is not destroyed by\ninteraction. The maps of CO cover most of the optical disk of the galaxies. We\ninvestigated the influence of bar on the distribution of molecular gas in\nspiral galaxies using these data. We confirmed that the degree of central\nconcentration is higher in barred spirals than in non-barred spirals as shown\nby the previous works. Furthermore, we present an observational evidence that\nbars are efficient in driving molecular gas that lies within the bar length\ntoward the center, while the role in bringing gas in from the outer parts of\nthe disks is small. The transported gas accounts for about half of molecular\ngas within the central region in barred spiral galaxies. We found a correlation\nbetween the degree of central concentration and bar strength. Galaxies with\nstronger bars tend to have higher central concentration. The correlation\nimplies that stronger bars accumulate molecular gas toward the center more\nefficiently. These results are consistent with long-lived bars.\n"}

{"text":"  We study two recently proposed equations of state (EOS) which are obtained\nfrom high temperature QCD, and show how they can be adapted to use them for\nmaking predictions for relativistic heavy ion collisions. The method involves\nextracting equilibrium distribution functions for quarks and gluons from the\nEOS, which in turn will allow a determination of the transport and other bulk\nproperties of the quark gluon plasma. Simultaneously, the method also yields a\nquasi particle description of interacting quarks and gluons. The first EOS is\nperturbative in the QCD coupling constant and has contributions of $O(g^5)$.\nThe second EOS is an improvement over the first, with contributions upto $\nO(g^6 ln(\\frac{1}{g}))$; it incorporates the nonperturbative hard thermal\ncontributions. The interaction effects are shown to be captured entirely by the\neffective chemical potentials for the gluons and the quarks, in both the cases.\nThe chemical potential is seen to be highly sensitive to the EOS. As an\napplication, we determine the screening lengths which are, indeed the most\nimportant diagnostics for QGP. The screening lengths are seen to behave\ndrastically differently depending on the EOS considered., and yield, therefore,\na way to distinguish the two equations of state in heavy ion collisions.\n"}

{"text":"  The common wisdom that the phonon mechanism of electron pairing in the\nweak-coupling Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) superconductors leads to\nconventional s-wave Cooper pairs is revised. An inevitable anisotropy of sound\nvelocity in crystals makes the phonon-mediated attraction of electrons\nnon-local in space providing unconventional Cooper pairs with a nonzero orbital\nmomentum in a wide range of electron densities. As a result of this anisotropy\nquasi-two dimensional charge carriers undergo a quantum phase transition from\nan unconventional d-wave superconducting state to a conventional s-wave\nsuperconductor with more carriers per unit cell. In the opposite\nstrong-coupling regime rotational symmetry breaking appears as a result of a\nreduced Coulomb repulsion between unconventional bipolarons dismissing thereby\nsome constraints on unconventional pairing in the Bose-Einstein condensation\n(BEC) limit. The conventional phonons, and not superexchange, are shown to be\nresponsible for the d-wave symmetry of cuprate superconductors, where the\non-site Coulomb repulsion is large.\n"}

These two Eupelmidae\nhave similar activity rhythms. Displacements of these parasitoids essentially\ntake place during the photophase.

Under these experimental conditions\negg-clutch size per host increased, and at the same time the mortality of eggs\nlaid also increased.

The wave flux decreases\noutward with radius, consistent with energy being dissipated. Some newly\ndiscovered large ripples beyond 100 kpc, and a possible intact bubble at 170\nkpc radius, may indicate a larger level of activity by the nucleus a few 100\nMyr ago.

To explain the blueshift, the blob should either\nbe of unipolar moving at the center-of-mass velocity v ~ 2,000 - 5,000 km s-1,\nor suffer from self-absorption within the ejecta as seen in SN 1990I. In both\ninterpretations, the low-mass blob component dominates the optical output both\nat the first peak (~ 20 days) and at the late phase (~ 300 days). The low\nluminosity at the late phase (the absolute R magnitude M_R ~ -10.2 mag at ~ 270\ndays) sets the upper limit for the mass of 56Ni < ~ 0.08 Msun, which is in\ncontradiction to the value necessary to explain the second, main peak\nluminosity (M_R ~ -18.3 mag at ~ 40 days).

Strong emission lines from\nHII regions are often used to study the metallicity of star-forming regions.

The N-body integrations employ particle numbers up to\n0.26M and a direct-summation potential solver; close interactions involving the\nbinary are treated using a new implementation of the Mikkola-Aarseth chain\nregularization algorithm. Even at these large values of N, two-body scattering\noccurs at high enough rates in the simulations that they can not be simply\nscaled to the large-N regime of real galaxies. The Fokker-Planck model is used\nto bridge this gap; it includes, for the first time, binary-induced changes in\nthe stellar density and potential. The Fokker-Planck model is shown to\naccurately reproduce the results of the N-body integrations, and is then\nextended to the much larger N regime of real galaxies. Analytic expressions are\nderived that accurately reproduce the time dependence of the binary semi-major\naxis as predicted by the Fokker-Planck model. Gravitational wave coalescence is\nshown to occur in <10 Gyr in nuclei with velocity dispersions below about 80\nkm\/s. Formation of a core results from a competition between ejection of stars\nby the binary and re-supply of depleted orbits via two-body scattering.

{"text":"  We revisit the model of a system made up of a Brownian quantum oscillator\nunder the influence of an external classical force and linearly coupled to an\nenvironment made up of many quantum oscillators at zero or finite temperature.\nWe show that the HPZ master equation for the reduced density matrix derived\nearlier [B.L.

Here we\nreport a comparative X-ray emission and absorption study of diffuse hot gas\nalong the sight lines toward 3C 273 and Mrk 421, on and off the enhancement,\nbut at similar Galactic latitudes. The diffuse 3\/4-keV emission intensity, as\nestimated from the ROSAT All Sky Survey, is about three times higher toward 3C\n273 than toward Mrk 421.

{"text":"  Flicker (1\/f^gamma) voltage noise spectrum is derived from finite-temperature\nquantum electromagnetic fluctuations produced by elementary charge carriers in\nexternal electric field.

This backreaction is described phenomenologically in terms of\nthe effective momentum space dimensionality, D.

In the present paper we deal with some of the simpler gauge choices\nwhich lead to interacting Klein-Gordon field theories for the conformal scalar\nwith a predicted SO(d,2) symmetry in a variety of interesting curved spacetimes\nin (d-1)+1 dimensions. More challenging and more interesting gauge choices\n(including some that relate to mass) which are left to future work are also\noutlined. Through this approach we discover a new realm of previously\nunexplored dualities and hidden symmetries that exist both in the macroscopic\nand microscopic worlds, at the classical and quantum levels. Such phenomena\npredicted by 2T-physics can in principle be confirmed both by theory and\nexperiment. 1T-physics can be used to analyze the predictions but in most\ninstances gives no clue that the predicted phenomena exist in the first place.\nThis point of view suggests a new paradigm for the construction of a\nfundamental theory that is likely to impact on the quest for unification.\n"}
{"text":"  We derive steady equilibria for lateral downslope moisture flow in an\nidealized thin closed layer as a solution to the 1D Richards' Equation. The\nequilibria are determined by two free parameters: the downslope flux and a\nboundary condition. Solutions exhibit a constant downslope flow speed and\nmoisture content for the constant equilibrium flux, which is the product of the\ntwo. However where an isolated zone of fixed saturation degree exists\nrepresenting a boundary condition, the flow speed immediately upslope is\nreduced and the moisture content correspondingly increased to preserve the\nconstant equilibrium flux. The capillary head jump at the saturated zone\nproduces a blockage that gives a high moisture content back upslope through a\npooling distance determined by the equilibrium condition that the downslope\nflux is constant. In our numerical integrations, the vertically projected\npooling height is more than 10 km for a fully saturated zone in mixed silty or\nclay soils, but decreases by about an order of magnitude with every 10%\ndecrease in the boundary-zone saturation degree. The drying of downhill\nsaturated zones with the increased speed of mountain moisture outflow and\ncorresponding decreased mountain moisture content gives a viable explanation\nfor the mysterious ~69% unaccounted drop seen in the spring outflow in the La\nLuz \/ Fresnal Watershed at Alamogordo's upstream spring-box diversions in the\nsemiarid southeastern New Mexico USA.\n"}
{"text":"  We discuss theoretically the properties of an electromechanical oscillator\nwhose operation is based upon the cyclic, quasi-conservative conversion between\ngravitational potential, kinetic, and magnetic energies. The system consists of\na strong-pinning type-II superconductor square loop subjected to a constant\nexternal force and to magnetic fields. The loop oscillates in the upright\nposition at a frequency that can be tuned in the range 10-1000 Hz, and has\ninduced in it a rectified electrical current. The emphasis of this paper is on\nthe evaluation of the major remaining source of losses in the oscillations. We\nargue that such losses should be associated with the viscous vibration of\npinned flux lines in the superconductor Nb-Ti wire, provided the oscillator is\nkept close to zero Kelvin, under high-vacuum, and the magnetic field is\nsufficiently uniform. We discuss how other different sources of loss would\nbecome negligible for such operational conditions, so that a very high quality\nfactor Q exceeding 10^(10) might in principle be reached by the oscillator. The\nprospective utilization of such oscillator as a low-frequency high-Q clock is\nanalyzed.Since publication the ideas in this paper have been explored both by\nthe author and elsewhere, in applications covering Metrology, quantum systems,\nand gravimetry.\n"}
{"text":"  This paper studies the ergodic capacity of time- and frequency-selective\nmultipath fading channels in the ultrawideband (UWB) regime when training\nsignals are used for channel estimation at the receiver. Motivated by recent\nmeasurement results on UWB channels, we propose a model for sparse multipath\nchannels. A key implication of sparsity is that the independent degrees of\nfreedom (DoF) in the channel scale sub-linearly with the signal space dimension\n(product of signaling duration and bandwidth). Sparsity is captured by the\nnumber of resolvable paths in delay and Doppler. Our analysis is based on a\ntraining and communication scheme that employs signaling over orthogonal\nshort-time Fourier (STF) basis functions. STF signaling naturally relates\nsparsity in delay-Doppler to coherence in time-frequency. We study the impact\nof multipath sparsity on two fundamental metrics of spectral efficiency in the\nwideband\/low-SNR limit introduced by Verdu: first- and second-order optimality\nconditions. Recent results by Zheng et. al. have underscored the large gap in\nspectral efficiency between coherent and non-coherent extremes and the\nimportance of channel learning in bridging the gap. Building on these results,\nour results lead to the following implications of multipath sparsity: 1) The\ncoherence requirements are shared in both time and frequency, thereby\nsignificantly relaxing the required scaling in coherence time with SNR; 2)\nSparse multipath channels are asymptotically coherent -- for a given but large\nbandwidth, the channel can be learned perfectly and the coherence requirements\nfor first- and second-order optimality met through sufficiently large signaling\nduration; and 3) The requirement of peaky signals in attaining capacity is\neliminated or relaxed in sparse environments.\n"}
{"text":"  In contrast to the prevalent assumption of rich multipath in information\ntheoretic analysis of wireless channels, physical channels exhibit sparse\nmultipath, especially at large bandwidths. We propose a model for sparse\nmultipath fading channels and present results on the impact of sparsity on\nnon-coherent capacity and reliability in the wideband regime. A key implication\nof sparsity is that the statistically independent degrees of freedom in the\nchannel, that represent the delay-Doppler diversity afforded by multipath,\nscale at a sub-linear rate with the signal space dimension (time-bandwidth\nproduct). Our analysis is based on a training-based communication scheme that\nuses short-time Fourier (STF) signaling waveforms. Sparsity in delay-Doppler\nmanifests itself as time-frequency coherence in the STF domain. From a capacity\nperspective, sparse channels are asymptotically coherent: the gap between\ncoherent and non-coherent extremes vanishes in the limit of large signal space\ndimension without the need for peaky signaling. From a reliability viewpoint,\nthere is a fundamental tradeoff between channel diversity and learnability that\ncan be optimized to maximize the error exponent at any rate by appropriately\nchoosing the signaling duration as a function of bandwidth.\n"}
{"text":"  Due to the presence of a large orbital angular momentum of the parton system\nproduced at the early stage of non-central heavy-ion collisions, quarks and\nanti-quarks are shown to be polarized in the direction opposite to the reaction\nplane which is determined by the impact-parameter and the beam momentum.

In this case, the sequential filter is given the freedom to\nchoose the path over which it traverses the random field (e.g., noisy image or\nvideo sequence), thus it is natural to ask what is the best achievable\nperformance and how sensitive this performance is to the choice of the scan. We\nformally define the problem of scanning and filtering, derive a bound on the\nbest achievable performance and quantify the excess loss occurring when\nnon-optimal scanners are used, compared to optimal scanning and filtering.\n  We then discuss the problem of sequential scanning and prediction of noisy\nrandom fields.

The solution to the generic case then clearly points to the source of\nthe time coincidence integer problem in the Friedman dust universe model. It is\nthen possible to eliminate this coincidence by removing a degeneracy between\ndifferent measurement epoch times.

We generalize our\nresults to the prestellar cores in Taurus and in Orion. In Taurus the ambient\nradiation field heating the prestellar cores is believed to be weaker than than\nthat in rho Oph. Hence, the dust temperatures of the cores in Taurus are\nexpected to be below ~ 10-11 K.In Orion the radiation field is believed to be\n10^3 times stronger than the standard interstellar radiation field. Based on\nthis assumption we estimate that the dust temperatures of the prestellar cores\nin Orion are around ~20-30K.\n"}

We detected 3 independent frequencies with\namplitudes below 0.01mag, f1 = 4.7126 c\/d, f2 = 2.2342 c\/d and f3 = 4.671 c\/d,\nand discovered that V2104Cyg is a Be star.

Both HNC and HC3N are, however, significantly more\nexcited than the other species which requires higher gas densities - or\nradiative excitation through e.g. mid-IR pumping. The HCN line intensity is\nfainter than that of HCO+ and HNC for the 3-2 transition, in contrast to\nprevious findings for the 1-0 lines where the HCN emission is the most\nluminous.

{"text":"  Motivated by heavy ion collision experiments, we study the hydrodynamic\nproperties of non-Abelian systems.

Taking a similar perspective as Jackiw and\ncoworkers, we show that non-abelian hydrodynamical currents can be factored in\na non-coherent 'classical' part, and a coherent part requiring macroscopic\nnon-abelian quantum entanglement. Non-abelian flow being thus a much richer\naffair than familiar hydrodynamics, permits us to classify the various spin\ntransport phenomena in in condensed matter physics in a unifying framework.In\nsemiconductor spintronics, the absence of hydrodynamics is well known, but in\nour formulation it is directly associated with the fact that non-abelian\ncurrents are only covariantly conserved.We analyze the quantum mechanical\nsingle particle currents of relevance to mesoscopic transport with as highlight\nthe Aharonov-Casher effect, where we demonstrate that the non-abelian transport\nstructure renders it much more fragile than its abelian counterpart, the\nAharonov-Bohm effect.

METHODS: We use the X-ray spectral\nanalysis to assess the presence of an AGN in these sources and to characterize\nits properties. RESULTS: We detect AGN activity in 33 out of 35 sources. The\nremaining 2 sources are the ones with the lowest X-ray luminosity in the sample\n(L[2-10keV]<10^41 erg s^-1) and their X-ray emission could be produced within\nthe host galaxy. We find that the ``recognition problem'' for AGN is very\ncritical in the low-luminosity regime (at least 60% of the AGN with\nL[2-10keV]<10^43 erg s^-1 are elusive) becoming negligible for high X-ray\nluminosities (~1.5% of elusive AGN with L[2-10keV]>10^44 erg s^-1).

CONCLUSIONS:\nWe find that the simplest explanations of why these 33 (or most of them) AGNs\nare elusive are two: at low X-ray luminosities (<10^43 erg s^-1) the most\nimportant reason is the intrinsically low AGN\/galaxy contrast (optical\ndilution) while at high luminosities (>10^44 erg s^-1) it is due to the optical\nabsorption (in the Compton-thin regime, i.e. NH<10^24 cm^-2).

{"text":"  The recent HESS detections of supernova remnant shells in TeV gamma-rays\nconfirm the theoretical predictions that supernova remnants can operate as\npowerful cosmic ray accelerators. If these objects are responsible for the bulk\nof galactic cosmic rays, then they should accelerate protons and nuclei to\n10^15 eV and beyond, i.e. act as cosmic PeVatrons. The model of diffusive shock\nacceleration allows, under certain conditions, acceleration of particles to\nsuch high energies and their gradual injection into the interstellar medium,\nmainly during the Sedov phase of the remnant evolution. The most energetic\nparticles are released first, while particles of lower energies are more\neffectively confined in the shell, and are released at later epochs. Thus the\nspectrum of nonthermal paticles inside the shell extends to PeV energies only\nduring a relatively short period of the evolution of the remnant.

Low-mass galaxies\nhave small Dn4000 and at increasing stellar mass, the galaxy distribution moves\nto higher Dn4000 values as observed in the local Universe. As cosmic time goes\nby, we witness an increasing abundance of massive spectroscopically ET systems\nat the expense of the LT systems. This spectral transformation is a process\nstarted at early epochs and continuing efficiently down to the local Universe.\nThis is confirmed by the evolution of our type-dependent stellar mass function.\nThe underlying stellar ages of LT galaxies apparently do not show evolution,\nlikely as a result of a continuous formation of new stars. All star formation\nactivity indicators consistently point towards a star formation history peaked\nin the past for massive galaxies, with little or no residual star formation\ntaking place in the most recent epochs. The activity and efficiency of forming\nstars are mechanisms that depend on stellar mass, and the mass assembly becomes\nprogressively less efficient in massive systems as time elapses.

Above $f_c$, an abrupt first order transition to a\nrod-like structure occurs. Our predictions can be tested using single molecule\nexperiments.\n"}
{"text":"  We extend to the first 300 Riemann zeros, the form of analysis reported by us\nin arXiv:math-ph\/0606005, in which the largest study had involved the first 75\nzeros. Again, we model the nonsmooth fluctuating part of the Wu-Sprung\npotential, which reproduces the Riemann zeros, by the alternating-sign sine\nseries fractal of Berry and Lewis A(x,g). Setting the fractal dimension equal\nto 3\/2. we estimate the frequency parameter (g), plus an overall scaling\nparameter (s) introduced. We search for that pair of parameters (g,s) which\nminimizes the least-squares fit of the lowest 300 eigenvalues -- obtained by\nsolving the one-dimensional stationary (non-fractal) Schrodinger equation with\nthe trial potential (smooth plus nonsmooth parts) -- to the first 300 Riemann\nzeros.

{"text":"  We study the two-photon process for the transitions ns --> 1s and nd --> 1s\nin hydrogen up to large n. For n<=20 we provide simple analytic fitting\nformulae to describe the non-resonant part of the two-photon emission profiles.\nCombining these with the analytic form of the cascade-term yields a simple and\naccurate description of the full two-photon decay spectrum, which only involves\na sum over a few intermediate states. We demonstrate that the cascade term\nnaturally leads to a nearly Lorentzian shape of the two-photon profiles in the\nvicinity of the resonances. However, due to quantum-electrodynamical\ncorrections, the two-photon emission spectra deviate significantly from the\nLorentzian shape in the very distant wings of the resonances. We investigate up\nto which distance the two-photon profiles are close to a Lorentzian and discuss\nthe role of the interference term. We then analyze how the deviation of the\ntwo-photon profiles from the Lorentzian shape affects the dynamics of\ncosmological hydrogen recombination. Since in this context the escape of\nphotons from the Lyman-alpha resonance plays a crucial role, we concentrate on\nthe two-photon corrections in the vicinity of the Lyman-alpha line. Our\ncomputations show that the changes in the ionization history due to the\nadditional two-photon process from high shell (n>2) likely do not reach the\npercent-level. For conservative assumptions we find a correction DN_e\/N_e~-0.4%\nat redshift z~1160. This is numerically similar to the result of another recent\nstudy; however, the physics leading to this conclusion is rather different. In\nparticular, our calculations of the effective two-photon decay rates yield\nsignificantly different values, where the destructive interference of the\nresonant and non-resonant terms plays a crucial role in this context (abridged)\n"}

We\ndescribe a theoretical model for the expected radial distribution of extrasolar\nplanets that combines an analytic description of migration with an empirically\ncalibrated disk model. The disk model includes viscous evolution and mass loss\nvia photoevaporation. Comparing the predicted distribution to a uniformly\nselected subsample of planets from the Lick \/ Keck \/ AAT planet search\nprograms, we find that a simple model in which planets form in the outer disk\nat a uniform rate, migrate inward according to a standard Type II prescription,\nand become stranded when the gas disk is dispersed, is consistent with the\nradial distribution of planets for orbital radii 0.1 AU < a < 2.5 AU and planet\nmasses greater than 1.65 Jupiter masses. Some variant models are disfavored by\nexisting data, but the significance is limited (~95%) due to the small sample\nof planets suitable for statistical analysis. We show that the favored model\npredicts that the planetary mass function should be almost independent of\norbital radius at distances where migration dominates the massive planet\npopulation. We also study how the radial distribution of planets depends upon\nthe adopted disk model. We find that the distribution can constrain not only\nchanges in the power-law index of the disk viscosity, but also sharp jumps in\nthe efficiency of angular momentum transport that might occur at small radii.\n"}

The dependence on\nanomalous couplings of all these observables has been previously obtained. In\nthis work we show that some of the new observables also have smaller systematic\nuncertainties than the helicity fractions, with a dependence on anomalous\ncouplings similar or stronger than for helicity fractions.

{"text":"  The redshift distribution of galaxy lenses in known gravitational lens\nsystems provides a powerful test that can potentially discriminate amongst\ncosmological models. However, applications of this elegant test have been\ncurtailed by two factors: our ignorance of how galaxies evolve with redshift,\nand the absence of methods to deal with the effect of incomplete information in\nlensing systems. In this paper, we investigate both issues in detail. We\nexplore how to extract the properties of evolving galaxies, assuming that the\ncosmology is well determined by other techniques. We propose a new nested Monte\nCarlo method to quantify the effects of incomplete data. We apply the\nlens-redshift test to an improved sample of seventy lens systems derived from\nrecent observations, primarily from the SDSS, SLACS and the CLASS surveys. We\nfind that the limiting factor in applying the lens-redshift test derives from\npoor statistics, including incomplete information samples, and biased sampling.\nMany lenses that uniformly sample the underlying true image separation\ndistribution will be needed to use this test as a complementary method to\nmeasure the value of the cosmological constant or the properties of evolving\ngalaxies. Planned future surveys by missions like the SNAP satellite or LSST\nare likely to usher in a new era for strong lensing studies that utilize this\ntest.

{"text":"  We perform three-dimensional smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations in a\nrealistic cosmological setting to investigate the expansion, feedback, and\nchemical enrichment properties of a 200 M_sun pair-instability supernova in the\nhigh-redshift universe. We find that the SN remnant propagates for a Hubble\ntime at z = 20 to a final mass-weighted mean shock radius of 2.5 kpc (proper),\nroughly half the size of the HII region, and in this process sweeps up a total\ngas mass of 2.5*10^5 M_sun. The morphology of the shock becomes highly\nanisotropic once it leaves the host halo and encounters filaments and\nneighboring minihalos, while the bulk of the shock propagates into the voids of\nthe intergalactic medium. The SN entirely disrupts the host halo and terminates\nfurther star formation for at least 200 Myr, while in our specific case it\nexerts positive mechanical feedback on neighboring minihalos by\nshock-compressing their cores. In contrast, we do not observe secondary star\nformation in the dense shell via gravitational fragmentation, due to the\nprevious photoheating by the progenitor star. We find that cooling by metal\nlines is unimportant for the entire evolution of the SN remnant, while the\nmetal-enriched, interior bubble expands adiabatically into the cavities created\nby the shock, and ultimately into the voids with a maximum extent similar to\nthe final mass-weighted mean shock radius.

{"text":"  We present a semi-analytic model for shaping the nebula around eta Carinae\nthat accounts for the simultaneous production of bipolar lobes and an\nequatorial disk through a rotating surface explosion. Material is launched\nnormal to the surface of an oblate rotating star with an initial kick velocity\nthat scales approximately with the local escape speed. Thereafter, ejecta\nfollow ballistic orbital trajectories, feeling only a central force\ncorresponding to a radiatively reduced gravity. Our model is conceptually\nsimilar to the wind-compressed disk model of Bjorkman & Cassinelli, but we\nmodify it to an explosion instead of a steady line-driven wind, we include a\nrotationally-distorted star, and we treat the dynamics somewhat differently.\nContinuum-driving avoids the disk inhibition that normally operates in\nline-driven winds. Our model provides a simple method by which rotating hot\nstars can simultaneously produce intrinsically bipolar and equatorial mass\nejections, without an aspherical environment or magnetic fields. Although\nmotivated by eta Carinae, the model may have generic application to other LBVs,\nB[e] stars, or SN1987A's nebula. When near-Eddington radiative driving is less\ninfluential, our model generalizes to produce bipolar morphologies without\ndisks, as seen in many PNe.\n"}

{"text":"  I discuss outstanding questions about the formation of the ring nebula around\nSN1987A and some implications of similar ring nebulae around Galactic B\nsupergiants.

Instead, several clues hint that the nebula may have been\nejected in an LBV-like event. In addition to the previously known example of\nSher25, there are two newly-discovered Galactic analogs of SN1987A's ringed\nnebula. Of these three Galactic analogs around blue supergiants, two (Sher25\nand SBW1) have chemical abundances indicating that they have not been through a\nred supergiant phase, and the remaining ringed bipolar nebula surrounds a\nluminous blue variable (HD168625).

{"text":"  Searches for planets in close binary systems explore the degree to which\nstellar multiplicity inhibits or promotes planet formation. There is a\ndegeneracy between planet formation models when only systems with single stars\nare studied--several mechanisms appear to be able to produce such a final\nresult. This degeneracy is lifted by searching for planets in binary systems;\nthe resulting detections (or evidence of non-existence) of planets in binaries\nisolates which models may contribute to how planets form in nature. In this\nchapter, we consider observational efforts to detect planetary companions to\nbinary stars in two types of hierarchical planet-binary configurations: first\n``S-type'' planets which orbit just one of the stars, with the binary period\nbeing much longer than the planet's; second, ``P-type'' or circumbinary\nplanets, where the planet simultaneously orbits both stars, and the planetary\norbital period is much longer than that of the binary. The S-type planet\nfinding techniques are different for binaries that can or cannot be spatially\nresolved. For wider systems, techniques reviewed include dualstar\ninterferometric differential astrometry and precision radial velocities.\nAlternatively, unresolved binaries can be studied using modified dualstar\n\"PHASES-style\" differential astrometry or a modification of the radial velocity\ntechnique for composite spectra.

{"text":"  A novel method to estimate the pixels simultaneous detection probability and\nthe spatial resolution of pixelized detectors is proposed, which is based on\nthe determination of the statistical correlations between detector neighbor\npixels. The correlations are determined by means of noise variance measurement\nfor a isolated pixels and the difference between neighbor pixels. The method is\nvalidated using images from the two different GE Senographe 2000D mammographic\nunits. The pixelized detector has been irradiated using x-rays along its entire\nsurface. It is shown that the pixel simultaneous detection probabilities can be\nestimated within accuracy 0.001 - 0.003, where the systematic error is\nestimated to be smaller than 0.005. The presampled two-dimensional point-spread\nfunction (PSF0) is determined using a single Gaussian and a sum of two Gaussian\napproximations. The obtained results for the presampled PSF0 show that the\nsingle Gaussian approximation is not appropriate, and the sum of two Gaussian\napproximations providing the best fit predicts the existence of a large (~50%)\nnarrow component.

{"text":"  A transmitter without channel state information (CSI) wishes to send a\ndelay-limited Gaussian source over a slowly fading channel.

The\nexpected distortion is minimized by optimally allocating the transmit power\namong the source layers. For two source layers, the allocation is optimal when\npower is first assigned to the higher layer up to a power ceiling that depends\nonly on the channel fading distribution; all remaining power, if any, is\nallocated to the lower layer.

As the bandwidth ratio b (channel uses\nper source symbol) tends to zero, the power distribution that minimizes\nexpected distortion converges to the one that maximizes expected capacity.\nWhile expected distortion can be improved by acquiring CSI at the transmitter\n(CSIT) or by increasing diversity from the realization of independent fading\npaths, at high SNR the performance benefit from diversity exceeds that from\nCSIT, especially when b is large.\n"}
{"text":"  The solar and extra solar gas giants appear to have diverse internal\nstructure and metallicities. We examine a potential cause for these dispersions\nin the context of the conventional sequential accretion formation scenario. In\nprinciple, gas accretion onto cores with masses below several times that of the\nEarth is suppressed by the energy released from the bombardment of residual\nplanetesimals. We show that these planetesimals generally cannot pass through\nthe mean motion resonances of the cores, and the suppression of planetesimal\nbombardment rate enables the cores to accrete gas with little interruption.\nDuring growth from the cores to protoplanets, as the resonances overlap with\neach other, the trapped planetesimals become dynamically unstable and their\neccentricity excitation is strongly enhanced. Subsequent gas drag induces the\nplanetesimals to migrate and collide with the protoplanet. This process leads\nto the resumption and a surge of planetesimal bombardment during the advanced\nstage of the protoplanet growth.

We identify for each case 3 different accreting behaviours.\n1) In regions where no significant dV increase is observed, ``classical''\n(i.e., single-star) accretion is possible. 2) In regions where $dV>v_{ero}$,\nthe threshold velocity above which all impacts are eroding, no accretion is\npossible and planet growth is stopped. 3) In between these 2 limiting\nbehaviours, a large fraction of binary configurations leads to significant dV\nincrease, but still below the erosion threshold. In this intermediate case,\nplanetesimal growth can occur, but proceeds slower than in the single-star\ncase, possibly following the so-called type II runaway groth mode.\n"}
{"text":"  To reveal how nonequilibrium physics and relativity theory intertwine, this\narticles studies relativistic Brownian motion under cosmic expansion. Two\nfluctuation theorems for the entropy ds, which is locally produced in this\nextreme nonequilibrium situation, are presented and proven. The first,\n<exp(-ds)>=1, is a generalization of the second law of thermodynamics, that\nremains valid at relativistic particle energies and under high cosmic expansion\nrates. From this relation follows, that the probability to observe a local\nreduction of entropy is exponentially small even if the universe was to\nrecollapse. For the special case of the Einstein-de Sitter universe an\nadditional relation, <exp(-ds-dh)>=1, is derived which holds simultaneously\nwith the first relation and where dh is proportional to the Hubble constant.\nFurthermore, the fluctuation theorems are shown to provide a physical criterion\nto resolve the known discretization dilemma arising in special-relativistic\nBrownian motion. Explicit examples and a general method for the computation of\nnon-Gaussian entropy fluctuations are provided.\n"}
{"text":"  We present spectroscopic observations of a sample of 72 emission-line\nobjects, including mainly HII regions, in the spiral galaxy M 33. Spectra were\nobtained with the multi-object, wide field spectrograph AF2\/WYFFOS at the 4.2m\nWHT telescope. Line intensities, extinction, and electron density were\ndetermined for the whole sample of objects. The aim of the present work was to\nderive chemical and physical parameters of a set of HII regions, and from them\nthe metallicity gradient. Electron temperatures and chemical abundances were\nderived for the 14 HII regions where both [OII] and [OIII] emission line fluxes\nwere measured, including the electron temperature sensitive emission line\n[OIII] 436.3 nm and in a few cases [NII] 575.5 nm. The ionization correction\nfactor (ICF) method was used to derive the total chemical abundances. The\npresence of abundance gradients was inferred from the radial behaviour of\nseveral emission-line ratios, and accurately measured from chemical abundances\ndirectly derived in 14 HII regions. The oxygen abundances of our HII regions,\nlocated in the radial region from ~2 to ~7.2 kpc, gave an oxygen gradient\n-0.054+\/-0.011 dex\/kpc The overall oxygen gradient for M 33 obtained using ours\nand previous oxygen determinations in a large number of HII regions with direct\nelectron temperature determination as well as abundance in young stars\npresented a two slope shape: -0.19 dex\/kpc for the central regions (R<3kpc),\nand -0.038dex\/kpc for the outer regions (R>=3kpc).\n"}

{"text":"  We show using computer simulations and mean field theory that a system of\nparticles in two dimensions, when confined laterally by a pair of parallel hard\nwalls within a quasi one dimensional channel, possesses several anomalous\nstructural and mechanical properties not observed in the bulk.

At fixed $\\rho$, a\nchange in $L_y$ leads to many reentrant discontinuous transitions involving\nchanges in the number of layers parallel to the confining walls depending\ncrucially on the commensurability of inter-layer spacing with $L_y$. The solid\nshows resistance to elongation but not to shear. When strained beyond the\nelastic limit it fails undergoing plastic deformation but surprisingly, as the\nstrain is reversed, the material recovers completely and returns to its\noriginal undeformed state. We obtain the phase diagram from mean field theory\nand finite size simulations and discuss the effect of fluctuations.\n"}

{"text":"  [ABRIDGED] We report the results of a 944-epoch survey for transient sources\nwith archival data from the Very Large Array spanning 22 years with a typical\nepoch separation of 7 days.

Ten transient sources were detected with\na significance threshold such that only one false positive would be expected.\nOf these transients, eight were detected in only a single epoch. Two transients\nwere too faint to be detected in individual epochs but were detected in\ntwo-month averages. None of the ten transients was detected in longer-term\naverages or associated with persistent emission in the deep image produced from\nthe combination of all epochs. The cumulative rate for the short timescale\nradio transients above 370 microJy at 5 and 8.4 GHz is 0.07 < R < 40 deg^-2\nyr^-1, where the uncertainty is due to the unknown duration of the transients,\n20 min < t_char < 7 days. A two-epoch survey for transients will detect 1.5 +\/-\n0.4 transient per square degrees above a flux density of 370 microJy. Two\ntransients are associated with galaxies at z=0.040 and z=0.249.

{"text":"  The use of the sine-Gordon equation as a model of magnetic flux propagation\nin Josephson junctions motivates studying the initial-value problem for this\nequation in the semiclassical limit in which the dispersion parameter $\\e$\ntends to zero. Assuming natural initial data having the profile of a moving\n$-2\\pi$ kink at time zero, we analytically calculate the scattering data of\nthis completely integrable Cauchy problem for all $\\e>0$ sufficiently small,\nand further we invert the scattering transform to calculate the solution for a\nsequence of arbitrarily small $\\e$. This sequence of exact solutions is\nanalogous to that of the well-known $N$-soliton (or higher-order soliton)\nsolutions of the focusing nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation. Plots of exact\nsolutions for small $\\e$ reveal certain features that emerge in the\nsemiclassical limit. For example, in the limit $\\epsilon\\to 0$ one observes the\nappearance of nonlinear caustics. In the appendices we give a self contained\naccount of the Cauchy problem from the perspectives of both inverse scattering\nand classical analysis (Picard iteration). Specifically, Appendix A contains a\ncomplete formulation of the inverse-scattering method for generic $L^1$-Sobolev\ninitial data, and Appendix B establishes the well-posedness for $L^p$-Sobolev\ninitial data (which in particular completely justifies the inverse-scattering\nanalysis in Appendix A).\n"}
{"text":"  Although it is commonly agreed that the presence of a close stellar companion\nis likely to affect planet formation and evolution, the precise effects and\ntheir actual impact on planet occurrence and properties are still debated. In\nparticular, observational constraints are sparse, a consequence of the\ndiscrimination against close binaries in Doppler planet searches. To bring\nobservational constraints on the occurrence and properties of planets in\nbinaries and multiple stars, we have been conducting two dedicated observing\nprograms using both adaptive optics imaging and radial-velocity monitoring. In\nthis chapter we explain our approach and present preliminary results from these\ntwo programs. A simplified statistical analysis of the data from our VLT\/NACO\nimaging survey brings the first observational evidence that the occurrence of\nplanets is reduced in binaries closer than ~120 AU. On the radial-velocity\nside, current results confirm that the use of two-dimensional correlation\nallows to search for circumprimary giant planets in many types of spectroscopic\nbinaries.

We use three fitting approaches which provide best fit\nparameter values and hint towards a bulk energy component that behaves like\nrelativistic matter which is propagating in the bulk and is moving at a speed v\nalong the fifth dimension, while the bulk-brane energy exchange component\ncorresponds to negative pressure and signifies energy flowing from the bulk\ninto the brane. We find that the best fit effective equation of state parameter\n$w_{eff}$ marginally crosses the phantom divide line w=-1.

{"text":"  We review the models and results of simulations of self-gravitating, gaseous\nprotoplanetary disks in binary star systems.

We show that interactions with the companion\nstar can affect the temperature distribution and structural evolution of disks,\nand discuss the implications for giant planet formation by gravitational\ninstability as well as by core accretion. Complete consensus has not been\nreached yet on whether the formation of giant planets is promoted or suppressed\nby tidal interactions with a companion star. While systems with binary\nseparations of order 100 AU or larger appear to behave more or less as in\nisolation, systems with smaller separations exhibit an increased or decreased\nsusceptibility to fragmentation, depending on the details of thermodynamics, in\nparticular on the inclusion or absence of artificial viscosity, and on the\ninitial conditions. While code comparisons on identical problems need to be\ncarried out (some of which are already in progress) to decide which computer\nmodels are more realistic, it is already clear that relatively close binary\nsystems, with separations of order 60 AU or less, should provide strong\nconstraints on how giant planets form in these systems.\n"}
{"text":"  This paper presents a stability test for a class of interconnected nonlinear\nsystems motivated by biochemical reaction networks.

Construction is built on a distributive\nlaw of T_l with a second (co)monad T_r on M, a natural transformation i:\\Pi T_l\n\\to \\Pi T_r, and a morphism w: T_r X \\to T_l X in M. The relations i and w need\nto satisfy are categorical versions of Kaygun's axioms of a transposition map.\nMotivation comes from the observation that a (co)ring T over an algebra R\ndetermines a distributive law of two (co)monads T_l=T \\otimes_R (-) and T_r =\n(-)\\otimes_R T on the category of R-bimodules. The functor \\Pi can be chosen\nsuch that Z^n= T\\hat{\\otimes}_R... \\hat{\\otimes}_R T \\hat{\\otimes}_R X is the\ncyclic R-module tensor product. A natural transformation i:T \\hat{\\otimes}_R\n(-) \\to (-) \\hat{\\otimes}_R T is given by the flip map and a morphism w: X\n\\otimes_R T \\to T\\otimes_R X is constructed whenever T is a (co)module algebra\nor coring of an R-bialgebroid. Stable anti Yetter-Drinfel'd modules over\ncertain bialgebroids, so called x_R-Hopf algebras, are introduced. In the\nparticular example when T is a module coring of a x_R-Hopf algebra B and X is a\nstable anti Yetter-Drinfel'd B-module, the para-cyclic object Z_* is shown to\nproject to a cyclic structure on T^{\\otimes_R *+1} \\otimes_B X.

The different structures of\nfrictional packings assembled by various methods cannot be classified by the\nsole density.

Low\ncoordination packings have many rattlers (more than 10% of the grains carry no\nforce), which should be accounted for on studying position correlations, and a\nsmall proportion of harmless \"floppy modes\" associated with divalent grains.\nFrictional packings, however slowly assembled under low pressure, retain a\nfinite level of force indeterminacy, except in the limit of infinite friction.\n"}

{"text":"  This is the second paper of a series of three investigating, by numerical\nmeans, the geometric and mechanical properties of spherical bead packings under\nisotropic stresses. We study the effects of varying the applied pressure P\n(from 1 or 10 kPa up to 100 MPa in the case of glass beads) on several types of\nconfigurations assembled by different procedures, as reported in the preceding\npaper. As functions of P, we monitor changes in solid fraction \\Phi,\ncoordination number z, proportion of rattlers (grains carrying no force) x0,\nthe distribution of normal forces, the level of friction mobilization, and the\ndistribution of near neighbor distances. Assuming the contact law does not\ninvolve material plasticity or damage, \\Phi is found to vary very nearly\nreversibly with P in an isotropic compression cycle, but all other quantities,\ndue to the frictional hysteresis of contact forces, change irreversibly. In\nparticular, initial low P states with high coordination numbers lose many\ncontacts in a compression cycle, and end up with values of z and x0 close to\nthose of the most poorly coordinated initial configurations. Proportional load\nvariations which do not entail notable configuration changes can therefore\nnevertheless significantly affect contact networks of granular packings in\nquasistatic conditions.\n"}
{"text":"  In this third and final paper of a series, elastic properties of numerically\nsimulated isotropic packings of spherical beads assembled by different\nprocedures and subjected to a varying confining pressure P are investigated. In\naddition P, which determines the stiffness of contacts by Hertz's law, elastic\nmoduli are chiefly sensitive to the coordination number, the possible values of\nwhich are not necessarily correlated with the density. Comparisons of numerical\nand experimental results for glass beads in the 10kPa-10MPa range reveal\nsimilar differences between dry samples compacted by vibrations and lubricated\npackings. The greater stiffness of the latter, in spite of their lower density,\ncan hence be attributed to a larger coordination number. Voigt and Reuss bounds\nbracket bulk modulus B accurately, but simple estimation schemes fail for shear\nmodulus G, especially in poorly coordinated configurations under low P.\nTenuous, fragile networks respond differently to changes in load direction, as\ncompared to load intensity. The shear modulus, in poorly coordinated packings,\ntends to vary proportionally to the degree of force indeterminacy per unit\nvolume. The elastic range extends to small strain intervals, in agreement with\nexperimental observations. The origins of nonelastic response are discussed. We\nconclude that elastic moduli provide access to mechanically important\ninformation about coordination numbers, which escape direct measurement\ntechniques, and indicate further perspectives.\n"}

{"text":"  Up till now very few dying sources were known, presumably because the dying\nphase is short at centimeter wavelengths.

Improving the statistics of dying sources will give us a better\nhandle on the evolution of radio sources, in particular the frequency and time\nscales of radio activity. We have used the WENSS and NVSS surveys, in order to\nfind sources with steep spectral indices, associated with nearby elliptical\ngalaxies. In the cross correlation we presently used only unresolved sources,\nwith flux densities at 1.4 GHz larger than 10 mJy.

One finds that alpha depends on\npolymer molecular weights as alpha ~ M^0.8, and \\nu appears to have large-M and\nsmall-M values with a crossover linking them. The probe diffusion coefficient\ndoes not simply track the solution viscosity; instead, D_p eta typically\nincreases markedly with increasing polymer concentration and molecular weight.\nIn some systems, e.g., hydroxypropylcellulose:water, the observed probe spectra\nare bi- or tri-modal.

{"text":"  Most cool core clusters of galaxies possess active galactic nuclei (AGN) in\ntheir centers. These AGN inflate buoyant bubbles containing non-thermal radio\nemitting particles. If such bubbles efficiently confine cosmic rays (CR) then\nthis could explain ``radio ghosts'' seen far from cluster centers. We simulate\nthe diffusion of cosmic rays from buoyant bubbles inflated by AGN. Our\nsimulations include the effects of the anisotropic particle diffusion\nintroduced by magnetic fields. Our models are consistent with the X-ray\nmorphology of AGN bubbles, with disruption being suppressed by the magnetic\ndraping effect. We conclude that for such magnetic field topologies, a\nsubstantial fraction of cosmic rays can be confined inside the bubbles on\nbuoyant rise timescales even when the parallel diffusivity coefficient is very\nlarge. For isotropic diffusion at a comparable level, cosmic rays would leak\nout of the bubbles too rapidly to be consistent with radio observations. Thus,\nthe long confinement times associated with the magnetic suppression of CR\ndiffusion can explain the presence of radio ghosts. We show that the partial\nescape of cosmic rays is mostly confined to the wake of the rising bubbles, and\nspeculate that this effect could: (1) account for the excitation of the\nH$\\alpha$ filaments trailing behind the bubbles in the Perseus cluster, (2)\ninject entropy into the metal enriched material being lifted by the bubbles\nand, thus, help to displace it permanently from the cluster center and (3)\nproduce observable $\\gamma$-rays via the interaction of the diffusing cosmic\nrays with the thermal intracluster medium (ICM).\n"}
{"text":"  We use CO and H alpha velocity fields to study the gas kinematics in the\nspiral arms and interarms of M51 (NGC 5194), and fit the 2D velocity field to\nestimate the radial and tangential velocity components as a function of spiral\nphase (arm distance). We find large radial and tangential streaming velocities,\nwhich are qualitatively consistent with the predictions of density wave theory\nand support the existence of shocks. The streaming motions are complex, varying\nsignificantly across the galaxy as well as along and between arms. Aberrations\nin the velocity field indicate that the disk is not coplanar, perhaps as far in\nas 20\\arcsec\\ (800 pc) from the center. Velocity profile fits from CO and H\nalpha are typically similar, suggesting that most of the H alpha emission\noriginates from regions of recent star formation. We also explore vortensity\nand mass conservation conditions. Vortensity conservation, which does not\nrequire a steady state, is empirically verified. The velocity and density\nprofiles show large and varying mass fluxes, which are inconsistent with a\nsteady flow for a single dominant global spiral mode. We thus conclude that the\nspiral arms cannot be in a quasi-steady state in any rotating frame, and\/or\nthat out of plane motions may be significant.\n"}
{"text":"  We compute the effect of local electrons on the CMB temperature anisotropies.\nThe number density and distribution of free electrons in our Galaxy has been\naccurately measured from pulsar dispersion measurements. Because of their\ndistribution, the dynamics of our Galaxy and the Galaxy peculiar velocity with\nrespect to the Hubble flow, these free electrons leave a frequency-independent\nimprint on the cosmic microwave background (CMB). In particular, the coherent\nmotion of the free electrons respect to us and to the CMB rest frame produce a\nkinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich signal. We compute this effect and we note that the\nlarge-scale antisymmetry of the signal gives it an angular power spectrum with\na sawtooth pattern where even multipoles are suppressed with respect to the odd\nones. We find the signal to be small (~ 2 uK) and sub-dominant compared to the\nprimary CMB and other foreground signals. However, since there are no free\nparameters in the modeling of this signal, it can be taken into account if more\nprecise measurements of the primordial signal are required.\n"}
{"text":"  A new generation of radio telescopes are currently being built with the goal\nof tracing the cosmic distribution of atomic hydrogen at redshifts 6-15 through\nits 21-cm line.

While the\nstandard correlation function is determined by a complicated mixture of\ncontributions from density and ionization fluctuations, we show that the\ndifference PDF holds the key to separately measuring the statistical properties\nof the ionized regions.\n"}

{"text":"  The nature of the coupling leading to superconductivity in layered materials\nsuch as high-Tc superconductors and graphite intercalation compounds (GICs) is\nstill unresolved. In both systems, interactions of electrons with either\nphonons or other electrons or both have been proposed to explain\nsuperconductivity. In the high-Tc cuprates, the presence of a Van Hove\nsingularity (VHS) in the density of states near the Fermi level was long ago\nproposed to enhance the many-body couplings and therefore may play a role in\nsuperconductivity. Such a singularity can cause an anisotropic variation in the\ncoupling strength, which may partially explain the so-called nodal-antinodal\ndichotomy in the cuprates. Here we show that the topology of the graphene band\nstructure at dopings comparable to the GICs is quite similar to that of the\ncuprates and that the quasiparticle dynamics in graphene have a similar\ndichotomy.

The new simulations follow evolution of the CR\ndistribution to much higher energies than our previous study, providing a\nbetter examination of evolutionary and asymptotic behaviors. The postshock CR\npressure becomes constant after quick initial adjustment, since the evolution\nof the CR partial pressure expressed in terms of a momentum similarity variable\nis self-similar. The shock precursor, which scales as the diffusion length of\nthe highest energy CRs, subsequently broadens approximately linearly with time,\nindependent of diffusion model, so long as CRs continue to be accelerated to\never-higher energies. This means the nonlinear shock structure can be described\napproximately in terms of the similarity variable, x\/(u_s t), where u_s is the\nshock speed once the postshock pressure reaches an approximate time asymptotic\nstate. As before, the shock Mach number is the key parameter determining the\nevolution and the CR acceleration efficiency, although finite Alfven wave drift\nand wave energy dissipation in the shock precursor reduce the effective\nvelocity change experienced by CRs, so reduce acceleration efficiency\nnoticeably, thus, providing a second important parameter at low and moderate\nMach numbers.\n"}

{"text":"  It has long been suggested that helium nuclei in the intracluster plasma can\nsediment in the cluster gravitational potential well.

This presents a\nsignificant source of uncertainty for cosmological tests based on the X-ray\nderived cluster quantities, such as the gas mass, total mass, and gas mass\nfraction, all of which depend on the assumed helium abundance. We point out\nthat cluster distances derived by combining the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) and\nX-ray data also depend on the helium abundance.

{"text":"  In 1953, Kuhn showed that every sequential game has a Nash equilibrium by\nshowing that a procedure, named ``backward induction'' in game theory, yields a\nNash equilibrium.

In game theory, payoffs are rewards usually granted at the\nend of a game. Although traditional game theory mainly focuses on real-valued\npayoffs that are implicitly ordered by the usual total order over the reals,\nworks of Simon or Blackwell already involved partially ordered payoffs. This\npaper generalises the notion of sequential game by replacing real-valued payoff\nfunctions with abstract atomic objects, called outcomes, and by replacing the\nusual total order over the reals with arbitrary binary relations over outcomes,\ncalled preferences. This introduces a general abstract formalism where Nash\nequilibrium, subgame perfect equilibrium, and ``backward induction'' can still\nbe defined. This paper proves that the following three propositions are\nequivalent: 1) Preferences over the outcomes are acyclic. 2) Every sequential\ngame has a Nash equilibrium. 3) Every sequential game has a subgame perfect\nequilibrium.

The color\nscatter of the blue sequence is relatively small sigma(U-V) = 0.25 (0.03) and\nconstant to z~3, but notably asymmetrical with a sharp blue ridge and a wing\ntowards redder colors. We explore sets of star formation histories to study the\nconstraints placed by the shape of the scatter at z=2-3. One particular set of\nmodels, episodic star formation, reproduces the detailed properties very well.\nFor a two-state model with high and low star formation, the duty cycle is\nconstrained to be > 40% and the contrast between the states must be a factor >\n5 (or a scatter in log(SFR) of > 0.35 dex around the mean). However, episodic\nmodels do not explain the observed tail of very red galaxies, primarily Distant\nRed Galaxies (DRGs), which may have ceased star formation altogether or are\nmore heavily obscured. Finally, the relative number density of red, luminous MV\n< -20.5 galaxies increases by a factor of ~ 6 from z = 2.7 to z = 0.5, as does\ntheir contribution to the total rest-frame V-band luminosity density. We are\nlikely viewing the progressive formation of red, passively evolving galaxies.\n"}
{"text":"  We study bottlebrush macromolecules in a good solvent by small-angle neutron\nscattering (SANS), static light scattering (SLS), and dynamic light scattering\n(DLS). These polymers consist of a linear backbone to which long side chains\nare chemically grafted. The backbone contains about 1600 monomer units (weight\naverage) and every second monomer unit carries side-chains with ca. 60 monomer\nunits. The SLS- and SANS data extrapolated to infinite dilution lead to the\nform factor of the polymer that can be described in terms of a worm-like chain\nwith a contour length of 380 nm and a persistence length of 17.5 nm. An\nanalysis of the DLS data confirm these model parameters. The scattering\nintensities taken at finite concentration can be modeled using the polymer\nreference interaction site model. It reveals a softening of the bottlebrush\npolymers caused by their mutual interaction. We demonstrate that the\npersistence decreases from 17.5 nm down to 5 nm upon increasing the\nconcentration from dilute solution to the highest concentration 40.59 g\/l under\nconsideration. The observed softening of the chains is comparable to the\ntheoretically predicted decrease of the electrostatic persistence length of\nlinear polyelectrolyte chains at finite concentrations.\n"}

These are the widest ranges of\nages and metallicities in which the behaviour of the Ca II triplet lines has\nbeen investigated in a homogeneous way. We report the first empirical study of\nthe variation of the CaII triplet lines strength, for given metallicities, with\nrespect to luminosity. We find that the sequence defined by each cluster in the\nLuminosity-$\\Sigma$Ca plane is not exactly linear. However, when only stars in\na small magnitude interval are observed, the sequences can be considered as\nlinear. We have studied the the Ca II triplet lines on three metallicities\nscales. While a linear correlation between the reduced equivalent width ($W'_V$\nor $W'_I$) versus metallicity is found in the \\citet{cg97} and \\citet{ki03}\nscales, a second order term needs to be added when the \\citet{zw84} scale is\nadopted. We investigate the role of age from the wide range of ages covered by\nour sample.

{"text":"  We report the detection of CN(N=3-2) emission towards the Cloverleaf quasar\n(z=2.56) based on observations with the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer.\nThis is the first clear detection of emission from this radical at high\nredshift. CN emission is a tracer of dense molecular hydrogen gas (n(H2) > 10^4\ncm^{-3}) within star-forming molecular clouds, in particular in regions where\nthe clouds are affected by UV radiation. The HCN\/CN intensity ratio can be used\nas a diagnostic for the relative importance of photodissociation regions (PDRs)\nin a source, and as a sensitive probe of optical depth, the radiation field,\nand photochemical processes. We derive a lensing-corrected CN(N=3-2) line\nluminosity of L'(CN(3-2) = (4.5 +\/- 0.5) x 10^9 K km\/s pc^2. The ratio between\nCN luminosity and far-infrared luminosity falls within the scatter of the same\nrelationship found for low-z (ultra-) luminous infrared galaxies. Combining our\nnew results with CO(J=3-2) and HCN(J=1-0) measurements from the literature and\nassuming thermal excitation for all transitions, we find a CO\/CN luminosity\nratio of 9.3 +\/- 1.9 and a HCN\/CN luminosity ratio of 0.95 +\/- 0.15. However,\nwe find that the CN(N=3-2) line is likely only subthermally excited, implying\nthat those ratios may only provide upper limits for the intrinsic 1-0 line\nluminosity ratios.

{"text":"  We present a proof that quantum Yang-Mills theory can be consistently defined\nas a renormalized, perturbative quantum field theory on an arbitrary globally\nhyperbolic curved, Lorentzian spacetime. To this end, we construct the\nnon-commutative algebra of observables, in the sense of formal power series, as\nwell as a space of corresponding quantum states. The algebra contains all gauge\ninvariant, renormalized, interacting quantum field operators (polynomials in\nthe field strength and its derivatives), and all their relations such as\ncommutation relations or operator product expansion. It can be viewed as a\ndeformation quantization of the Poisson algebra of classical Yang-Mills theory\nequipped with the Peierls bracket. The algebra is constructed as the cohomology\nof an auxiliary algebra describing a gauge fixed theory with ghosts and\nanti-fields. A key technical difficulty is to establish a suitable hierarchy of\nWard identities at the renormalized level that ensure conservation of the\ninteracting BRST-current, and that the interacting BRST-charge is nilpotent.\nThe algebra of physical interacting field observables is obtained as the\ncohomology of this charge. As a consequence of our constructions, we can prove\nthat the operator product expansion closes on the space of gauge invariant\noperators. Similarly, the renormalization group flow is proved not to leave the\nspace of gauge invariant operators.\n"}
{"text":"  In random-access communication systems, the number of active users varies\nwith time, and has considerable bearing on receiver's performance. Thus,\ntechniques aimed at identifying not only the information transmitted, but also\nthat number, play a central role in those systems. An example of application of\nthese techniques can be found in multiuser detection (MUD). In typical MUD\nanalyses, receivers are based on the assumption that the number of active users\nis constant and known at the receiver, and coincides with the maximum number of\nusers entitled to access the system. This assumption is often overly\npessimistic, since many users might be inactive at any given time, and\ndetection under the assumption of a number of users larger than the real one\nmay impair performance.\n  The main goal of this paper is to introduce a general approach to the problem\nof identifying active users and estimating their parameters and data in a\nrandom-access system where users are continuously entering and leaving the\nsystem. The tool whose use we advocate is Random-Set Theory: applying this, we\nderive optimum receivers in an environment where the set of transmitters\ncomprises an unknown number of elements. In addition, we can derive\nBayesian-filter equations which describe the evolution with time of the a\nposteriori probability density of the unknown user parameters, and use this\ndensity to derive optimum detectors. In this paper we restrict ourselves to\ninterferer identification and data detection, while in a companion paper we\nshall examine the more complex problem of estimating users' parameters.\n"}
{"text":"  We analyze collective modes in two-band superconductors in the dirty limit.\nIt is shown that these modes exist at all temperatures $T$ below $T_{c}$\nprovided the frequency of the modes is higher than the inelastic scattering\nrate and lower than the energy gaps $\\Delta_{a,b}$. At low temperatures these\nmodes are related to counterphase oscillations of the condensate currents in\neach band. The spectrum of the collective oscillations is similar to the\nspectrum of the Josephson ''plasma'' modes in a tunnel Josephson junction but\nthe velocity of the mode propagation in the case under consideration is much\nlower. At higher temperatures ($\\Delta_{b}<T<T_{c}$) the spectrum consists of\ntwo branches.

We analyze in detail the aging\nbehaviour of several two-times averaged and fluctuating observables taking into\naccount finite-size effects and the crossover to the stationary and equilibrium\nregimes. We start by investigating the structure factor and extracting from its\ndecay a growing correlation length. We present the full two-times and size\ndependence of the interface roughness and we generalize the Family-Vicsek\nscaling form to non-equilibrium situations. We compute the incoherent cattering\nfunction and we compare it to the one measured in other glassy systems. We\nanalyse the response functions, the violation of the fluctuation-dissipation\ntheorem in the aging regime, and its crossover to the equilibrium relation in\nthe stationary regime. Finally, we study the out-of-equilibrium fluctuations of\nthe previously studied two-times functions and we characterize the scaling\nproperties of their probability distribution functions.

{"text":"  Context: Cool stars, companions to compact objects, are known to show Li\nabundances which are high compared to field stars of the same spectral type,\nwhich are heavily Li depleted. This may be due either to Li production or Li\npreservation in these systems. Aims: To measure the lithium isotopic ratio in\nthe companion star of the neutron star X-ray binary Cen X-4. Method: We use\nUVES spectra obtained in years 2000 and 2004 around the orbital quadratures.\nThe spectra are analysed with spectrum synthesis techniques and the errors\nestimated with Monte Carlo simulations. Results: We measure A(Li)=2.87+-0.20\nand 6Li\/7Li = 0.12+0.08-0.05 at 68% confidence level. We also present updated\nsystem parameters with a refined determination of the orbital period and\ncomponent masses i.e. 1.14+-0.45 Msun and 0.23+-0.10 Msun for the neutron star\nand companion, respectively. Conclusions: In our view the low level of 6Li\nfavours Li preservation scenarios, although Li production mechanisms cannot be\nruled out. In the case of preservation, no Li is freshly created in the binary,\nbut the tidally-locked companion has preserved its original Li by some\nmechanism, possibly inhibited destruction due to its fast rotation.\n"}

We detected 57 sources in\nall four IRAC channels in a 6.2' x 4.8' field-of-view centered on N 90; 22 of\nthese sources are classified as candidate YSOs.

{"text":"  We theoretically investigate the ground state of trapped neutral fermions\nwith population imbalance in the BCS-BEC crossover regime. On the basis of the\nsingle-channel Hamiltonian, we perform full numerical calculations of the\nBogoliubov-de Gennes equation coupled with the regularized gap and number\nequations. The zero-temperature phase diagram in the crossover regime is\npresented, where the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) pairing state\ngoverns the weak-coupling BCS region of a resonance. It is found that the FFLO\noscillation vanishes in the BEC side, in which the system under population\nimbalance turns into a phase separation (PS) between locally binding superfluid\nand fully polarized spin domains. We also demonstrate numerical calculations\nwith a large particle number O(10^5), comparable to that observed in recent\nexperiments. The resulting density profile on a resonance yields the PS, which\nis in good agreement with the recent experiments, while the FFLO modulation\nexists in the pairing field. It is also proposed that the most favorable\nlocation for the detection of the FFLO oscillation is in the vicinity of the\ncritical population imbalance in the weak coupling BCS regime, where the\noscillation periodicity becomes much larger than the interparticle spacing.\nFinally, we analyze the radio-frequency (RF) spectroscopy in the imbalanced\nsystem. The clear difference in the RF spectroscopy between BCS and BEC sides\nreveals the structure of the pairing field and local ``magnetization''.\n"}
{"text":"  With the goal of investigating the degree to which the mid-infrared emission\ntraces the star formation rate (SFR), we analyze Spitzer 8 um and 24 um data of\nstar-forming regions in a sample of 33 nearby galaxies with available\nHST\/NICMOS images in the Paschen-alpha (1.8756 um) emission line. The galaxies\nare drawn from the Spitzer Infrared Nearby Galaxies Survey (SINGS) sample, and\ncover a range of morphologies and a factor ~10 in oxygen abundance. Published\ndata on local low-metallicity starburst galaxies and Luminous Infrared Galaxies\nare also included in the analysis. Both the stellar-continuum-subtracted 8 um\nemission and the 24 um emission correlate with the extinction-corrected\nPa-alpha line emission, although neither relationship is linear. Simple models\nof stellar populations and dust extinction and emission are able to reproduce\nthe observed non-linear trend of the 24 um emission versus number of ionizing\nphotons, including the modest deficiency of 24 um emission in the low\nmetallicity regions, which results from a combination of decreasing dust\nopacity and dust temperature at low luminosities. Conversely, the trend of the\n8 um emission as a function of the number of ionizing photons is not well\nreproduced by the same models. The 8 um emission is contributed, in larger\nmeasure than the 24 um emission, by dust heated by non-ionizing stellar\npopulations, in agreement with previous findings. Two SFR calibrations, one\nusing the 24 um emission and the other using a combination of the 24 um and\nH-alpha luminosities (Kennicutt et al. 2007), are presented. No calibration is\npresented for the 8 um emission, because of its significant dependence on both\nmetallicity and environment. The calibrations presented here should be directly\napplicable to systems dominated by on-going star formation.\n"}
{"text":"  The performance of telescope systems working at microwave or visible\/IR\nwavelengths is typically described in terms of different parameters according\nto the wavelength range. Most commercial ray tracing packages have been\nspecifically designed for use with visible\/IR systems and thus, though very\nflexible and sophisticated, do not provide the appropriate parameters to fully\ndescribe microwave antennas, and thus to compare with specifications. In this\nwork we demonstrate that the Strehl ratio is equal to the phase efficiency when\nthe apodization factor is taken into account. The phase efficiency is the most\ncritical contribution to the aperture efficiency of an antenna, and the most\ndifficult parameter to optimize during the telescope design.

{"text":"  General hypersurface layers are considered in order to describe brane-worlds\nand shell cosmologies.

Our\nformalism allows for a unified description of the traditional timelike\nbranes\/shells together with the signature-changing, or pure null, ones.

The description of a signature change as a\n`singularity' seen from within the brane is considered.

We also discuss charged AdS black\nholes in the grand canonical ensemble, corresponding to a Yang-Mills theory at\nfinite chemical potential, and find that there is always a gap for the infrared\ncutoff due to the existence of a minimal horizon for the charged AdS black\nholes with any horizon topology.\n"}
{"text":"  We measure the obscured star formation in z~1 early-type galaxies. This\nconstrains the influence of star formation on their optical\/near-IR colors,\nwhich, we found, are redder than predicted by the model by Bruzual & Charlot\n(2003). From deep ACS imaging we construct a sample of 95 morphologically\nselected early-type galaxies in the HDF-N and CDF-S with spectroscopic\nredshifts in the range 0.85<z<1.15. We measure their 24 micron fluxes from the\ndeep GOODS-MIPS imaging and derive the IR luminosities and star formation\nrates. The fraction of galaxies with >2 sigma detections (~25 muJy} is\n17(-4,+9)%. Of the 15 galaxies with significant detections at least six have an\nAGN. Stacking the MIPS images of the galaxies without significant detections\nand adding the detected galaxies without AGN we find an upper limit on the mean\nstar formation rate (SFR) of 5.2+\/-3.0 Msol yr^-1, and on the mean specific SFR\nof 4.6+\/-2.2 * 10^-11 yr^-1. Under the assumption that the average SFR will\ndecline at the same rate as the cosmic average, the in situ growth in stellar\nmass of the early-type galaxy population is less than 14+\/-7% between z=1 and\nthe present. We show that the typically low IR luminosity and SFR imply that\nthe effect of obscured star formation (or AGN) on their rest-frame\noptical\/near-IR SEDs is negligible for ~90% of the galaxies in our sample.\nHence, their optical\/near-IR colors are most likely dominated by evolved\nstellar populations. This implies that the colors predicted by the Bruzual &\nCharlot (2003) model for stellar populations with ages similar to those of z~1\nearly-type galaxies (~1-3 Gyr) are most likely too blue, and that stellar\nmasses of evolved, high-redshift galaxies can be overestimated by up to a\nfactor of ~2.\n"}

{"text":"  In spite of the efforts made in the latest years, still there is no\ncomprehensive explanation for the chemical anomalies of globular cluster stars.\nAmong these, the most striking is oxygen depletion, which reaches values down\nto [O\/Fe]~-0.4 in most clusters, but in M13 it goes down to less than [O\/Fe]~ -\n1. In this work we suggest that the anomalies are due to the super position of\ntwo different events: 1) PRIMORDIAL SELF-ENRICHMENT: this is asked to explain\nthe oxygen depletion down to a minimum value [O\/Fe]~ -0.4; 2) EXTRA MIXING IN A\nFRACTION OF THE STARS ALREADY BORN WITH ANOMALOUS COMPOSITION: these objects,\nstarting with already low [O\/Fe], will reduce the oxygen abundance down to the\nmost extreme values. Contrary to other models that invoke extra mixing to\nexplain the chemical anomalies, we suggest that it is active only if there is a\nfraction of the stars in which the primordial composition is not only oxygen\ndepleted, but also extremely helium rich (Y~ 0.4), as found in a few GCs from\ntheir main sequence multiplicity. We propose that the rotational evolution (and\nan associated extra mixing) of extremely helium rich stars may be affected by\nthe fact that they develop a very small or non existent molecular weight\nbarrier during the evolution. We show that extra mixing in these stars, having\ninitial chemistry that has already been CNO processed, affects mainly the\noxygen abundance, and to a much smaller extent if affects the sodium abundance.\nThe model also predicts a large fluorine depletion concomitant with the oxygen\ndepletion, and a further enhancement of the surface helium abundance, which\nreaches values close to Y=0.5 in the computed models. We stress that, in this\ntentative explanation, those stars that are primordially O--depleted, but ARE\nNOT extremely helium rich do not suffer deep extra mixing.\n"}

In numerical simulations, the\nmodel still shows the so-called sign problem, a difficulty peculiar to non-zero\nchemical potential, but it permits the development of algorithms which ensure a\ngood overlap of the Monte Carlo ensemble with the true one. We review the main\nfeatures of the model and present calculations concerning the dependence of\nvarious observables on the chemical potential and on the temperature, in\nparticular of the charge density and the diquark susceptibility, which may be\nused to characterize the various phases expected at high baryonic density.

{"text":"  The coupling of the electromagnetic field to gravity is discussed. In the\npremetric axiomatic approach based on the experimentally well established\nconservation laws of electric charge and magnetic flux, the Maxwell equations\nare the same irrespective of the presence or absence of gravity. In this sense,\none can say that the charge \"substratum\" and the flux \"substratum\" are not\ninfluenced by the gravitational field directly. However, the interrelation\nbetween these fundamental substrata, formalized as the {\\it spacetime relation}\nH=H(F) between the 2-forms of the electromagnetic excitation H and the\nelectromagnetic field strength F, is affected by gravity. Thus the validity of\nthe equivalence principle for electromagnetism depends on the form of the\nspacetime relation. We discuss the nonlocal and local linear constitutive\nrelations and demonstrate that the spacetime metric can be accompanied also by\nskewon, dilaton, and axion fields. All these premetric companions of the metric\nmay eventually lead to a violation of the equivalence principle.\n"}

The quadratrix is a \"mechanical curve\" that can be used to rectify\nthe circle. The usual problem of squaring the circle is to construct a square\nwith the same area (or perimeter) as a given circle, in a finite number of\nsteps using compass and straightedge. Descartes worked in the reverse\ndirection: from a given square he constructed the radius of a circle with the\nsame perimeter, but in an infinite number of steps.\n  In this paper Euler reconstructs Descartes' argument and develops some\nconsequences of it. Euler finds that \\[ \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{2^n} \\tan\n\\frac{1}{2^n}\\phi = \\frac{1}{\\phi} - 2\\cot 2\\phi. \\] Integrating this yields \\[\n\\prod_{n=1}^\\infty \\sec \\frac{1}{2^n} \\phi = \\frac{2\\phi}{\\sin 2\\phi}. \\]\n  I'd like to thank Davide Crippa from the University of Paris 7 for some\nhelpful back and forth about this paper.\n  One of the only citations to this paper that I have found is in Pietro\nFerroni, De calculo integralium exercitatio mathematica, Allegrini, Florence,\n1792, pp. xxi--xxiii.

Using moderate-resolution optical spectrophotometry and\nthe MARCS stellar atmosphere models, we determine their physical properties and\nplace them on the H-R diagram for comparison with the predictions of current\nstellar evolutionary tracks. The radial velocities of these stars suggest that\nthey are likely all members of the Clouds rather than foreground dwarfs or halo\ngiants. Their locations in the H-R diagram also show us that those stars are\ncooler than the current evolutionary tracks allow, appearing to the right of\nthe Hayashi limit, a region in which stars are no longer in hydrodynamic\nequilibrium. These stars exhibit considerable variability in their V\nmagnitudes, and three of these stars also show changes in their effective\ntemperatures (and spectral types) on the time-scales of months. One of these\nstars, [M2002] SMC 055188, was caught in an M4.5 I state, as late as that seen\nin HV 11423 at its recent extreme: considerable later, and cooler, than any\nother supergiant in the SMC. In addition, we find evidence of variable\nextinction due to circumstellar dust and changes in the stars' luminosities,\nalso consistent with our recent findings for HV 11423 - when these stars are\nhotter they are also dustier and more luminous.

We examine planetary accretion around both stars ('P-type'\ncircumbinary orbits) or individual stars ('S-type' orbits) in binary systems,\nincluding terrestrial planet formation around each star in Alpha Centauri AB,\nthe closest binary star system to the Sun. For comparison, we also simulate\nplanetary growth from the same initial disk placed in the Sun-Jupiter-Saturn\nsystem and also around the Sun with neither giant planets nor a stellar\ncompanion perturbing the system. Our simulations show that giant and stellar\ncompanions not only truncate the disk, but hasten the accretion process by\nstirring up the planetary embryos to higher eccentricities and inclinations.\nTerrestrial planets similar to those in our Solar System formed around\nindividual stars in simulations with the binary periastron (closest approach)\ngreater than about 5 AU.

Such massive stars are found only in\nclusters with > 10^4 members. Moreover, there is only a small region around a\nsupernova within which disks can survive the blast yet be enriched to the level\nobserved in the Solar System. These two factors limit the overall likelihood of\nsupernova enrichment of a protoplanetary disk to < 1%.

{"text":"  We perform a set of non--radiative cosmological simulations of a preheated\nintracluster medium in which the entropy of the gas was uniformly boosted at\nhigh redshift. The results of these simulations are used first to test the\ncurrent analytic techniques of preheating via entropy input in the smooth\naccretion limit. When the unmodified profile is taken directly from\nsimulations, we find that this model is in excellent agreement with the results\nof our simulations. This suggests that preheated efficiently smoothes the\naccreted gas, and therefore a shift in the unmodified profile is a good\napproximation even with a realistic accretion history. When we examine the\nsimulation results in detail, we do not find strong evidence for entropy\namplification, at least for the high-redshift preheating model adopted here. In\nthe second section of the paper, we compare the results of the preheating\nsimulations to recent observations. We show -- in agreement with previous work\n-- that for a reasonable amount of preheating, a satisfactory match can be\nfound to the mass-temperature and luminosity-temperature relations. However --\nas noted by previous authors -- we find that the entropy profiles of the\nsimulated groups are much too flat compared to observations. In particular,\nwhile rich clusters converge on the adiabatic self--similar scaling at large\nradius, no single value of the entropy input during preheating can\nsimultaneously reproduce both the core and outer entropy levels. As a result,\nwe confirm that the simple preheating scenario for galaxy cluster formation, in\nwhich entropy is injected universally at high redshift, is inconsistent with\nobservations.\n"}

{"text":"  Recently, the iterative approach named linear tabling has received\nconsiderable attention because of its simplicity, ease of implementation, and\ngood space efficiency. Linear tabling is a framework from which different\nmethods can be derived based on the strategies used in handling looping\nsubgoals. One decision concerns when answers are consumed and returned. This\npaper describes two strategies, namely, {\\it lazy} and {\\it eager} strategies,\nand compares them both qualitatively and quantitatively. The results indicate\nthat, while the lazy strategy has good locality and is well suited for finding\nall solutions, the eager strategy is comparable in speed with the lazy strategy\nand is well suited for programs with cuts. Linear tabling relies on depth-first\niterative deepening rather than suspension to compute fixpoints. Each cluster\nof inter-dependent subgoals as represented by a top-most looping subgoal is\niteratively evaluated until no subgoal in it can produce any new answers. Naive\nre-evaluation of all looping subgoals, albeit simple, may be computationally\nunacceptable. In this paper, we also introduce semi-naive optimization, an\neffective technique employed in bottom-up evaluation of logic programs to avoid\nredundant joins of answers, into linear tabling. We give the conditions for the\ntechnique to be safe (i.e. sound and complete) and propose an optimization\ntechnique called {\\it early answer promotion} to enhance its effectiveness.\nBenchmarking in B-Prolog demonstrates that with this optimization linear\ntabling compares favorably well in speed with the state-of-the-art\nimplementation of SLG.\n"}

The sample was taken from a larger parent\nsample drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Here, the GBT data and\ninitial results are discussed. Over half (19 out of 30) of all observed\ngalaxies have detectable 21-cm emission. It was found that both the K+A and\nstar forming early-type (SFE) galaxies were on average more gas poor than disk\ngalaxies at the same luminosity while being more gas rich than more typical E\nand S0 galaxies with detected 21-cm emission. The gas richness of K+A galaxies\nappears to be similar to that of SFE galaxies. The star formation rates and\nestimated star formation time scales of the SFE galaxies imply that they are\ncapable of only marginally changing their atomic hydrogen content. Follow-up\nobservations are required to explore these same issues in terms of molecular\ngas, which is more likely to actively participate in the star formation\nprocess. Kinematic data for the HI gas, the warm ionised gas, and the stars\nwithin the galaxies combined with the SDSS $g$ and $i$ band surface brightness\nprofiles imply that the atomic hydrogen is most likely spatially coincident\nwith the star forming regions within ~1 kpc of the galaxies' centres.\n"}

{"text":"  The dust-to-gas ratios in three different samples of luminous, ultraluminous,\nand hyperluminous infrared galaxies are calculated by modelling their radio to\nsoft X-ray spectral energy distributions using composite models which account\nfor the photoionizing radiation from HII regions, starbursts, or AGNs, and for\nshocks. The models are limited to a set which broadly reproduces the mid-IR\nfine structure line ratios of local, IR bright, starburst galaxies. The results\nshow that two types of clouds contribute to the IR emission. Those\ncharacterized by low shock velocities and low preshock densities explain the\nfar-IR dust emission, while those with higher velocities and densities\ncontribute to mid-IR dust emission. An AGN is found in nearly all of the\nultraluminous IR galaxies and in half of the luminous IR galaxies of the\nsample. High IR luminosities depend on dust-to-gas ratios of about 0.1 by mass,\nhowever, most hyperluminous IR galaxies show dust-to-gas ratios much lower than\nthose calculated for the luminous and ultraluminous IR galaxies.\n"}
{"text":"  It is now an accepted fact that the size at which dunes form from a flat sand\nbed as well as their `minimal size' scales on the flux saturation length. This\nlength is by definition the relaxation length of the slowest mode toward\nequilibrium transport. The model presented by Parteli, Duran and Herrmann\n[Phys. Rev. E 75, 011301 (2007)] predicts that the saturation length decreases\nto zero as the inverse of the wind shear stress far from the threshold. We\nfirst show that their model is not self-consistent: even under large wind, the\nrelaxation rate is limited by grain inertia and thus can not decrease to zero.\nA key argument presented by these authors comes from the discussion of the\ntypical dune wavelength on Mars (650 m) on the basis of which they refute the\nscaling of the dune size with the drag length evidenced by Claudin and\nAndreotti [Earth Pla. Sci. Lett. 252, 30 (2006)]. They instead propose that\nMartian dunes, composed of large grains (500 micrometers), were formed in the\npast under very strong winds. We show that this saltating grain size, estimated\nfrom thermal diffusion measurements, is not reliable. Moreover, the microscopic\nphotographs taken by the rovers on Martian aeolian bedforms show a grain size\nof 87 plus or minus 25 micrometers together with hematite spherules at\nmillimetre scale. As those so-called ``blueberries'' can not be entrained by\nreasonable winds, we conclude that the saltating grains on Mars are the small\nones, which gives a second strong argument against the model of Parteli et al.\n"}

{"text":"  Quantified constraints and Quantified Boolean Formulae are typically much\nmore difficult to reason with than classical constraints, because quantifier\nalternation makes the usual notion of solution inappropriate.

Its key statements - that the\nEPR-Bell experiments to violate Bell's inequality verify nonlocality, and\nnonlocal correlations respect special relativity - are false. Both the EPR-Bell\nexperiments and theorems to support the \"non-signalling principle\" are based on\nthe implicit assumption that all quantum postulates and, in particular, Born's\naveraging rule are fully applicable to Cat states. However, this is not the\ncase. Introducing observables (e.g., correlations) for Cat states violates the\ncorrespondence principle. Pure (macro- and micro-)Cat states must be governed\nboth by the PMRs and superposition principle.

{"text":"  We investigate the influence of noise on a graph state generation scheme\nwhich exploits a mirror inverting spin chain. Within this scheme the spin chain\nis used repeatedly as an entanglement bus (EB) to create multi-partite\nentanglement. The noise model we consider comprises of each spin of this EB\nbeing exposed to independent local noise which degrades the capabilities of the\nEB. Here we concentrate on quantifying its performance as a single-qubit\nchannel and as a mediator of a two-qubit entangling gate, since these are basic\noperations necessary for graph state generation using the EB. In particular,\nfor the single-qubit case we numerically calculate the average channel fidelity\nand whether the channel becomes entanglement breaking, i.e., expunges any\nentanglement the transferred qubit may have with other external qubits. We find\nthat neither local decay nor dephasing noise cause entanglement breaking. This\nis in contrast to local thermal and depolarizing noise where we determine a\ncritical length and critical noise coupling, respectively, at which\nentanglement breaking occurs. The critical noise coupling for local\ndepolarizing noise is found to exhibit a power-law dependence on the chain\nlength. For two qubits we similarly compute the average gate fidelity and\nwhether the ability for this gate to create entanglement is maintained. The\nconcatenation of these noisy gates for the construction of a five qubit linear\ncluster state and a Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state indicates that the level\nof noise that can be tolerated for graph state generation is tightly\nconstrained.\n"}

{"text":"  We present a new technique for time-domain numerical evolution of the scalar\nfield generated by a pointlike scalar charge orbiting a black hole. Time-domain\nevolution offers an efficient way for calculating black hole perturbations,\nespecially as input for computations of the local self force acting on orbiting\nparticles. In Kerr geometry, the field equations are not fully separable in the\ntime domain, and one has to tackle them in 2+1 dimensions (two spatial\ndimensions and time; the azimuthal dependence is still separable). A technical\ndifficulty arises when the source of the field is a pointlike particle, as the\n2+1-dimensional perturbation is then singular: Each of the azimuthal modes\ndiverges logarithmically at the particle. To deal with this problem we split\nthe numerical domain into two regions: Inside a thin worldtube surrounding the\nparticle's worldline we solve for a regularized variable, obtained from the\nfull field by subtracting out a suitable ``puncture'' function, given\nanalytically. Outside this worldtube we solve for the full, original field. The\nvalue of the evolution variable is adjusted across the boundary of the\nworldtube.

CRs have a less pronounced\neffect on the cooling and collapse of primordial gas clouds inside more massive\ndark matter haloes with virial masses greater than approximately 10^8 M_sun at\nthe later stages of cosmological structure formation around z ~ 10 - 15. In\nthese clouds, even without CR flux the molecular abundance is already\nsufficient to allow cooling to the floor set by the temperature of the cosmic\nmicrowave background.\n"}
{"text":"  We report the discovery of two low-luminosity quasars at z~4, both of which\nshow prominent N IV] 1486A emission. This line is extremely rare in quasar\nspectra at any redshift; detecting it in two out of a sample of 23 objects\n(i.e., ~ 9% of the sample) is intriguing and is likely due to the\nlow-luminosity, high-redshift quasar sample we are studying. This is still a\npoorly explored regime, where contributions from associated, early starbursts\nmay be significant. One interpretation of this line posits photoionization by\nvery massive young stars.

Alternatively, we may be seeing a\nphenomenon related to the early evolution of quasar broad emission line\nregions. The non-detection (and possibly even broad absorption) of N V 1240A\nline in the spectrum of one of these quasars may support that interpretation.\nThese two objects may signal a new faint quasar population or an early AGN\nevolutionary stage at high redshifts.\n"}
{"text":"  Cooling of molecules via free-space dissipative scattering of photons is\nthought not to be practicable due to the inherently large number of Raman loss\nchannels available to molecules and the prohibitive expense of building\nmultiple repumping laser systems. The use of an optical cavity to enhance\ncoherent Rayleigh scattering into a decaying cavity mode has been suggested as\na potential method to mitigate Raman loss, thereby enabling the laser cooling\nof molecules to ultracold temperatures. We discuss the possibility of\ncavity-assisted laser cooling particles without closed transitions, identify\nconditions necessary to achieve efficient cooling, and suggest solutions given\nexperimental constraints. Specifically, it is shown that cooperativities much\ngreater than unity are required for cooling without loss, and that this could\nbe achieved via the superradiant scattering associated with intracavity\nself-localization of the molecules. Particular emphasis is given to the polar\nhydroxyl radical (OH), cold samples of which are readily obtained from Stark\ndeceleration.\n"}
{"text":"  We investigate isophotal properties and dust morphology in the nuclear\nregions of 84 radio galaxies, imaged in the optical and near-infrared as part\nof Hubble Space Telescope snapshot surveys. We present a sample-wide trend\nbetween host galaxy isophotal structure and the inclination of dusty\ncircumnuclear disks at the centers of 13 of these objects. We find that\ngalaxies containing edge-on disks are invariably seen to possess boxy\nisophotes, while round, face-on disks are seen exclusively in objects with\nround or elliptical isophotes. Dust-rich sources with disky isophotes are\nobserved only to possess dust in the form of extended filamentary lanes, and\nnot in settled distributions like disks. As we do not expect that edge-on and\nface-on disks reside in different populations of galaxies, we conclude that\nperceived isophotal boxiness is dependent upon the angle at which the observer\nviews the host galaxy's axis of symmetry. We discuss our results in the context\nof dissipative merger scenarios, and infer that dusty disks primarily reside in\nold, boxy remnants of gas-poor galaxy mergers, whereas filamentary dust lanes\nreside in younger disky remnants of gas-rich mergers.\n"}

The\npivotal step is to differentiate condition probability and logical condition\nprobability of a message. The paper illustrates the rationality of the formula,\ndiscusses the coherence of the generalized information formula and Popper's\nknowledge evolution theory. For optimizing data compression, the paper\ndiscusses rate-of-limiting-errors and its similarity to complexity-distortion\nbased on Kolmogorov's complexity theory, and improves the rate-distortion\ntheory into the rate-fidelity theory by replacing Shannon's distortion with\nsubjective mutual information.

To simplify this hierarchy we neglect\ncontributions to the vertices from higher-order cluster expansion terms. An\niterative solution of the resulting equations can be represented by diagrams\nwith three and four-leg vertices. We analyze the structure of the diagrammatic\nseries for the time-dependent density correlation function and obtain a\ndiagrammatic interpretation of reducible and irreducible memory functions.

{"text":"  We jointly model 22 early-type gravitational lens galaxies with stellar\ndynamical measurements using standard CDM halo models. The sample is\ninhomogeneous in both its mass distributions and the evolution of its stellar\npopulations unless the true uncertainties are significantly larger than the\nreported measurement errors. In general, the individual systems cannot\nconstrain halo models, in the sense that the data poorly constrains the stellar\nmass fraction of the halo. The ensemble of systems, however, strongly\nconstrains the average stellar mass represented by the visible galaxies to\n$0.026\\pm0.006$ of the halo mass if we neglect adiabatic compression, rising to\n$0.056\\pm0.011$ of the halo mass if we include adiabatic compression. Both\nestimates are significantly smaller than the global baryon fraction,\ncorresponding to a star formation efficiency for early-type galaxies of\n$10%-30%$.

{"text":"  Strongly warped regions, also known as throats, are a common feature of the\ntype IIB string theory landscape. If one of the throats is heated during\ncosmological evolution, the energy is subsequently transferred to other throats\nor to massless fields in the unwarped bulk of the Calabi-Yau orientifold. This\nenergy transfer proceeds either by Hawking radiation from the black hole\nhorizon in the heated throat or, at later times, by the decay of\nthroat-localized Kaluza-Klein states. In both cases, we calculate in a 10d\nsetup the energy transfer rate (respectively decay rate) as a function of the\nAdS scales of the throats and of their relative distance. Compared to existing\nresults based on 5d models, we find a significant suppression of the energy\ntransfer rates if the size of the embedding Calabi-Yau orientifold is much\nlarger than the AdS radii of the throats. This effect can be partially\ncompensated by a small distance between the throats. These results are\nrelevant, e.g., for the analysis of reheating after brane inflation. Our\ncalculation employs the dual gauge theory picture in which each throat is\ndescribed by a strongly coupled 4d gauge theory, the degrees of freedom of\nwhich are localized at a certain position in the compact space.\n"}
{"text":"  Within a half-parsec from the Galactic center (GC), there is a population of\ncoeval young stars which appear to reside in a coherent disk. Surrounding this\ndynamically-cool stellar system, there is a population of stars with a similar\nage and much larger eccentricities and inclinations relative to the disk. We\npropose a hypothesis for the origin of this dynamical dichotomy. Without\nspecifying any specific mechanism, we consider the possibility that both\nstellar populations were formed within a disk some 6 Myr ago. But this orderly\nstructure was dynamically perturbed outside-in by an intruding object with a\nmass ~10^4 Msun, which may be an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) or a dark\nstellar cluster hosting an IMBH. We suggest that the perturber migrated inward\nto ~0.15-0.3pc from the GC under the action of dynamical friction. Along the\nway, it captured many stars in the outer disk region into its mean-motion\nresonance, forced them to migrate with it, closely encountered with them, and\ninduced the growth of their eccentricity and inclination. But stars in the\ninner regions of the disk retain their initial coplanar structure. We predict\nthat some of the inclined and eccentric stars surrounding the disk may have\nsimilar Galactocentric semimajor axis.

{"text":"  The Mott critical point between a metal and a correlated insulator has\nusually been studied via density or spin density bosonic mode fluctuations\naccording to the standard Ginzburg-Landau-Wilson phase transition paradigm. A\nmoment's reflection leads to increasing doubts that such an approach should\nwork as the transition is nonmagnetic, voiding the relevance of spin density\nmodes. Charge density modes are irrelevelant since the long range Coulomb\ninteraction leads to a large plasmon gap and their incompressibility. In\nsolidarity with these doubts, recent measurements of the Mott critical point in\nlow dimensional organic materials yield critical exponents in violent\ndiasagreement with the bosonic mode criticality lore.

{"text":"  The WMAP experiment has revealed an excess of microwave emission from the\nregion around the center of our Galaxy.

In this letter,\nwe revisit this possibility. We find that the angular distribution of the WMAP\nHaze matches the prediction for dark matter annihilations with a cusped density\nprofile, $\\rho(r) \\propto r^{-1.2}$ in the inner kiloparsecs. Comparing the\nintensity in different WMAP frequency bands, we find that a wide range of\npossible WIMP annihilation modes are consistent with the spectrum of the haze\nfor a WIMP with a mass in the 100 GeV to multi-TeV range.

No\nboost factors are required.

{"text":"  This study of adsorption of normal alkanols at the oil\/water interface with\nx-ray reflectivity and tensiometry demonstrates that the liquid to gas\nmonolayer phase transition at the hexane\/water interface is thermodynamically\nfavorable only for long-chain alkanols.

The core is spun down by ~30% within\n500ms after bounce, and the rotational energy extracted from the core is\nchanneled into magnetic energy that generates a strong magnetically-driven\nwind, rather than a weak neutrino-driven wind. Baryon loading of the ejecta,\nwhile this wind prevails, precludes it from becoming relativistic. This\nsuggests that a GRB is not expected to emerge from such AICs during the early\nprotoneutron star phase, except in the unlikely event that the massive white\ndwarf has sufficient mass to lead to black hole formation.

{"text":"  Wireless sensor networks place sensors into an area to collect data and send\nthem back to a base station.

In this\napproach, the base station receives the fusion data and \"votes\" on the data\nfrom a randomly chosen sensor node. The vote comes from other sensor nodes,\ncalled \"witnesses,\" to verify the correctness of the fusion data. Because the\nbase station obtains the vote through the chosen node, the chosen node could\nforge the vote if it is compromised. Thus, the witness node must encrypt the\nvote to prevent this forgery.

In contrast to the standard prediction of\ninflation with un-polarized GWB, circularly polarized GWB generates\nnon-vanishing TB and EB-mode power spectra of CMB anisotropies.

{"text":"  Spitzer observations of extended dust in two optically normal elliptical\ngalaxies provide a new confirmation of buoyant feedback outflow in the hot gas\natmospheres around these galaxies. AGN feedback energy is required to prevent\nwholesale cooling and star formation in these group-centered galaxies. In NGC\n5044 we observe interstellar (presumably PAH) emission at 8 microns out to\nabout 5 kpc. Both NGC 5044 and 4636 have extended 70 microns emission from cold\ndust exceeding that expected from stellar mass loss. The sputtering lifetime of\nthis extended dust in the ~1keV interstellar gas, ~10^7 yrs, establishes the\ntime when the dust first entered the hot gas. Evidently the extended dust\noriginated in dusty disks or clouds, commonly observed in elliptical galaxy\ncores, that were disrupted, heated and buoyantly transported outward. The\nsurviving central dust in NGC 5044 and 4636 has been disrupted into many small\nfilaments. It is remarkable that the asymmetrically extended 8 micron emission\nin NGC 5044 is spatially coincident with Halpha+[NII] emission from warm gas. A\ncalculation shows that dust-assisted cooling in buoyant hot gas moving out from\nthe galactic core can cool within a few kpc in about ~10^7 yrs, explaining the\noptical line emission observed. The X-ray images of both galaxies are\ndisturbed. All timescales for transient activity - restoration of equilibrium\nand buoyant transport in the hot gas, dynamics of surviving dust fragments, and\ndust sputtering - are consistent with a central release of feedback energy in\nboth galaxies about 10^7 yrs ago.\n"}

{"text":"  This paper develops a cosmological hypothesis based on the following\npropositions:\n  1. Zero-point radiation derives from quantic fluctuations in space, and the\nwavelength of its photons with the greatest energy is inversely proportional to\nthe curvature of space.\n  2. The Universe began as the breaking in of photons of extremely high energy\ncontained in the 3-dimensional surface: $w^2+x^2+y^2+z^2=R^2_i$, whose radius\nhas continued to expand at the speed of ligth since its origin at $t=0$.\n  3. The wavelength of the photons is quantized and the quantum of wavelength\nis invariable.\n  These propositions imply that the value of the total energy of the zero-point\nradiation in the Universe remains constant and the condition $w^2 + x^2 + y^2 +\nz^2 = (R_i + ct)^2 = R_u^2$ determines that every point in our space is subject\nto a tension whose intensity $i$ is proportional to the curvature $1\/R_u$. Any\nincrease of $R_u$ implies a decrease in $i$ and consequently an energy flow\nwhich translates into an expansive force. Therefore, the Universe will expand\nindefinitely: no Big Crunch is possible. If the initial radius of the Universe\n$R_i$ has been smaller than the Schwarzschild radius, $R_s$, which corresponds\nto the total mass of the Universe, $M_u$, the generation of matter would have\nlasted for thousands of millions of years. Generation of matter over short\nperiods would have required values for $R_i$ of thousands of millions of light\nyears.\n"}

Our results show that the spatially\nextended system exhibit a resonant patterns and frequency-locking phenomena.\nThe system also shows that the noise and the external periodic forces play a\nconstructive role in the Scheffer's model: first, the noise can enhance the\noscillation of phytoplankton species' density and format a large clusters in\nthe space when the noise intensity is within certain interval. Second, the\nexternal periodic forces can induce 4:1 and 1:1 frequency-locking and spatially\nhomogeneous oscillation phenomena to appear. Finally, the resonant patterns are\nobserved in the system when the spatial noises and external periodic forces are\nboth turned on. Moreover, we found that the 4:1 frequency-locking transform\ninto 1:1 frequency-locking when the noise intensity increased. In addition to\nelucidating our results outside the domain of Turing instability, we provide\nfurther analysis of Turing linear stability with the help of the numerical\ncalculation by using the Maple software.

In this\npaper, we compute the exact spectral gap.\n  As in previous work by Carlen, Carvalho and Loss where a lower bound on the\nspectral gap was proved, we use a method that relates the spectral properties\nof $Q$ to the spectral properties of a simpler operator $P$, which is simply an\naverage of certain non commuting projections. The new feature is that we show\nhow to use a knowledge of certain eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of $P$ to\ndetermine spectral properties of $Q$, instead of simply using the spectral gap\nfor $P$ to bound the spectral gap for $Q$, inductively in $N$, as in previous\nwork.

{"text":"  Valiant introduced some 25 years ago an algebraic model of computation along\nwith the complexity classes VP and VNP, which can be viewed as analogues of the\nclassical classes P and NP. They are defined using non-uniform sequences of\narithmetic circuits and provides a framework to study the complexity for\nsequences of polynomials. Prominent examples of difficult (that is,\nVNP-complete) problems in this model includes the permanent and hamiltonian\npolynomials. While the permanent and hamiltonian polynomials in general are\ndifficult to evaluate, there have been research on which special cases of these\npolynomials admits efficient evaluation. For instance, Barvinok has shown that\nif the underlying matrix has bounded rank, both the permanent and the\nhamiltonian polynomials can be evaluated in polynomial time, and thus are in\nVP. Courcelle, Makowsky and Rotics have shown that for matrices of bounded\ntreewidth several difficult problems (including evaluating the permanent and\nhamiltonian polynomials) can be solved efficiently. An earlier result of this\nflavour is Kasteleyn's theorem which states that the sum of weights of perfect\nmatchings of a planar graph can be computed in polynomial time, and thus is in\nVP also.

{"text":"  Intracellular recordings of cortical neurons in vivo display intense\nsubthreshold membrane potential (Vm) activity. The power spectral density (PSD)\nof the Vm displays a power-law structure at high frequencies (>50 Hz) with a\nslope of about -2.5. This type of frequency scaling cannot be accounted for by\ntraditional models, as either single-compartment models or models based on\nreconstructed cell morphologies display a frequency scaling with a slope close\nto -4. This slope is due to the fact that the membrane resistance is\n\"short-circuited\" by the capacitance for high frequencies, a situation which\nmay not be realistic. Here, we integrate non-ideal capacitors in cable\nequations to reflect the fact that the capacitance cannot be charged\ninstantaneously. We show that the resulting \"non-ideal\" cable model can be\nsolved analytically using Fourier transforms. Numerical simulations using a\nball-and-stick model yield membrane potential activity with similar frequency\nscaling as in the experiments.

From a few basic assumptions, the full\nstructure of phenomenological thermodynamics and of classical and quantum\nstatistical mechanics is recovered.\n  Care has been taken to keep the foundations free of subjective aspects (which\ntraditionally creep in through information or probability).

{"text":"  The Casimir force, which results from the confinement of the quantum\nmechanical zero-point fluctuations of the electromagnetic fields, has received\nsignificant attention in recent years for its effect on micro- and nano-scale\nmechanical systems.

However,\ninteresting phenomena including repulsive forces are expected to exist in\ncertain circumstances between metals and dielectrics when the intervening\nmedium is not vacuum. In order to better understand the effect of the Casimir\nforce in such situations and to test the robustness of the generalized\nCasimir-Lifshitz theory, we have performed the first precision measurements of\nthe Casimir force between two metals immersed in a fluid. For this situation,\nthe measured force is attractive and is approximately 80% smaller than the\nforce predicted by Casimir for ideal metals in vacuum.

It is pointed out that,\ndespite their fourth-order character, such f(G) gravity models generally cannot\nreproduce arbitrary background cosmic evolutions; for example, the standard\nLCDM paradigm with Omega_DE = 0.76 cannot be realized in f(G) gravity theories\nunless f is a true cosmological constant because it imposes exclusionary\nconstraints on the form of f(G). We analyze the perturbation equations and find\nthat, as in f(R) model, the stability of early-time perturbation growth puts\nsome constraints on the functional form of f(G), in this case d^2 f\/d G^2 < 0.\nFurthermore, the stability of small-scale perturbations also requires that f\nnot deviate significantly from a constant. These analyses are illustrated by\nnumerically propagating the perturbation equations with a specific model\nreproducing a representative LCDM cosmic history.

{"text":"  Dusty hyperluminous galaxies in the early universe provide unique\nenvironments for studying the role of massive stars in the formation and\ndestruction of dust. At redshifts above ~ 6, when the universe was less than ~\n1 Gyr old, dust could have only condensed in the explosive ejecta of Type II\nsupernovae (SNe), since most of the progenitors of the AGB stars, the major\nalternative source of interstellar dust, did not have time to evolve off the\nmain sequence since the onset of star formation. In this paper we present\nanalytical models for the evolution of the gas, dust, and metals in high\nredshift galaxies, with a special application to SDSS J1148+5251, a\nhyperluminous quasar at z = 6.4. We find that an average supernova must\ncondense at least 1 Msun of dust to account for the observed dust mass in this\nquasar. Observationally, it is in excess of the largest dust yield of ~0.02\nMsun found thus far in the ejecta of any SN. If future observations find this\nto be a typical supernova dust yield, then additional processes, such as\naccretion onto preexisting grains, or condensation around the AGN will need to\nbe invoked to account for the large amount of dust in this and similar objects.\nThe galaxy's star formation history is still uncertain, and current\nobservations of the gas, metal, and dust contents of J1148 can be reproduced by\neither an intensive and short burst of star formation (~ 1000 Msun\/yr) with a\nduration of ~ 100 Myr, or a much lower star formation rate (~ 100 Msun\/yr)\noccurring over the lifetime of the galaxy.\n"}

{"text":"  We discuss the link between dark matter halos hosting the first PopIII stars\nand the rare, massive, halos that are generally considered to host bright\nquasars at high redshift z~6.

We show that the descendants of the first ~10^6 Msun\nvirialized halos do not, on average, end up in the most massive halos at z~6,\nbut rather live in a large variety of environments. The oldest PopIII\nprogenitors of the most massive halos at z~6, form instead from density peaks\nthat are on average one and a half standard deviations more common than the\nfirst PopIII star formed in the volume occupied by one bright high-z QSO.

We find that single power-laws can\ndescribe properly both the temperature and metallicity profiles at radii larger\nthan 0.1 r_180 in both CC and NCC systems, showing the NCC objects steeper\nprofiles outwards. A significant deviation is only present in the inner 0.1\nr_180.

{"text":"  Discrete control systems, as considered here, refer to the control theory of\ndiscrete-time Lagrangian or Hamiltonian systems. These discrete-time models are\nbased on a discrete variational principle, and are part of the broader field of\ngeometric integration. Geometric integrators are numerical integration methods\nthat preserve geometric properties of continuous systems, such as conservation\nof the symplectic form, momentum, and energy. They also guarantee that the\ndiscrete flow remains on the manifold on which the continuous system evolves,\nan important property in the case of rigid-body dynamics.\n  In nonlinear control, one typically relies on differential geometric and\ndynamical systems techniques to prove properties such as stability,\ncontrollability, and optimality. More generally, the geometric structure of\nsuch systems plays a critical role in the nonlinear analysis of the\ncorresponding control problems. Despite the critical role of geometry and\nmechanics in the analysis of nonlinear control systems, nonlinear control\nalgorithms have typically been implemented using numerical schemes that ignore\nthe underlying geometry.\n  The field of discrete control system aims to address this deficiency by\nrestricting the approximation to choice of a discrete-time model, and\ndeveloping an associated control theory that does not introduce any additional\napproximation. In particular, this involves the construction of a control\ntheory for discrete-time models based on geometric integrators that yields\nnumerical implementations of nonlinear and geometric control algorithms that\npreserve the crucial underlying geometric structure.\n"}
{"text":"  In this work we develop a microscopic physical model of early evolution,\nwhere phenotype,organism life expectancy, is directly related to genotype, the\nstability of its proteins in their native conformations which can be determined\nexactly in the model. Simulating the model on a computer, we consistently\nobserve the Big Bang scenario whereby exponential population growth ensues as\nsoon as favorable sequence-structure combinations (precursors of stable\nproteins) are discovered. Upon that, random diversity of the structural space\nabruptly collapses into a small set of preferred proteins. We observe that\nprotein folds remain stable and abundant in the population at time scales much\ngreater than mutation or organism lifetime, and the distribution of the\nlifetimes of dominant folds in a population approximately follows a power law.\nThe separation of evolutionary time scales between discovery of new folds and\ngeneration of new sequences gives rise to emergence of protein families and\nsuperfamilies whose sizes are power-law distributed, closely matching the same\ndistributions for real proteins. On the population level we observe emergence\nof species, subpopulations which carry similar genomes. Further we present a\nsimple theory that relates stability of evolving proteins to the sizes of\nemerging genomes.

{"text":"  It usually writes the boundary condition of the wave equation in the Coulomb\nfield as a rough form without considering the size of the atomic nucleus. The\nrough expression brings on that the solutions of the Klein-Gordon equation and\nthe Dirac equation with the Coulomb potential are divergent at the origin of\nthe coordinates, also the virtual energies, when the nuclear charges number Z >\n137, meaning the original solutions do not satisfy the conditions for\ndetermining solution. Any divergences of the wave functions also imply that the\nprobability density of the meson or the electron would rapidly increase when\nthey are closing to the atomic nucleus. What it predicts is not a truth that\nthe atom in ground state would rapidly collapse to the neutron-like. We\nconsider that the atomic nucleus has definite radius and write the exact\nboundary condition for the hydrogen and hydrogen-like atom, then newly solve\nthe radial Dirac-Coulomb equation and obtain a new exact solution without any\nmathematical and physical difficulties. Unexpectedly, the K value constructed\nby Dirac is naturally written in the barrier width or the equivalent radius of\nthe atomic nucleus in solving the Dirac equation with the exact boundary\ncondition, and it is independent of the quantum energy.

{"text":"  It is generally believed that the magnetic free energy accumulated in the\ncorona serves as a main energy source for solar explosions such as coronal mass\nejections (CMEs). In the framework of the flux rope catastrophe model for CMEs,\nthe energy may be abruptly released either by an ideal magnetohydrodynamic\n(MHD) catastrophe, which belongs to a global magnetic topological instability\nof the system, or by a fast magnetic reconnection across preexisting or\nrapidly-developing electric current sheets. Both ways of magnetic energy\nrelease are thought to be important to CME dynamics. To disentangle their\ncontributions, we construct a flux rope catastrophe model in the corona and\nsolar wind and compare different cases in which we either prohibit or allow\nmagnetic reconnection to take place across rapidly-growing current sheets\nduring the eruption. It is demonstrated that CMEs, even fast ones, can be\nproduced taking the ideal MHD catastrophe as the only process of magnetic\nenergy release. Nevertheless, the eruptive speed can be significantly enhanced\nafter magnetic reconnection sets in. In addition, a smooth transition from slow\nto fast eruptions is observed when increasing the strength of the background\nmagnetic field, simply because in a stronger field there is more free magnetic\nenergy at the catastrophic point available to be released during an eruption.\nThis suggests that fast and slow CMEs may have an identical driving mechanism.\n"}
{"text":"  It remains an open question how magnetic energy is rapidly released in the\nsolar corona so as to create solar explosions such as solar flares and coronal\nmass ejections (CMEs). Recent studies have confirmed that a system consisting\nof a flux rope embedded in a background field exhibits a catastrophic behavior,\nand the energy threshold at the catastrophic point may exceed the associated\nopen field energy. The accumulated free energy in the corona is abruptly\nreleased when the catastrophe takes place, and it probably serves as the main\nmeans of energy release for CMEs at least in the initial phase. Such a release\nproceeds via an ideal MHD process in contrast with nonideal ones such as\nmagnetic reconnection. The catastrophe results in a sudden formation of\nelectric current sheets, which naturally provide proper sites for fast magnetic\nreconnection. The reconnection may be identified with a solar flare associated\nwith the CME on one hand, and produces a further acceleration of the CME on the\nother. On this basis, several preliminary suggestions are made for future\nobservational investigations, especially with the proposed KuaFu satellites, on\nthe roles of the MHD catastrophe and magnetic reconnection in the magnetic\nenergy release associated with CMEs and flares.\n"}

{"text":"  A derivation of the equations of motion of general relativity is presented\nthat does not invoke the Axiom of Choice, but requires the explicit\nconstruction of a choice function q for continuous three-space regions. The\nmotivation for this (seemingly academic) endeavour is to take the background\nindependence intrinsic to Einstein gravity one step further, and to assure that\nboth the equations of motion and the way in which those equations of motion are\nderived are as self-consistent as possible. That is, solutions to the equations\nof motion of general relativity endow a three-space region with a physical and\ndistinguishing geometry in four-dimensional space-time. However, in order to\nderive these equations of motion one should first be able to choose a\nthree-space region without having any prior knowledge of its physically\nappropriate geometry. The expression of this choice process requires a\nthree-dimensional topological manifold Q, to which all considered three-space\nregions belong, and that generates an equation of motion whose solutions are q.\nThese solutions relate the effects of curvature to the source term through the\ntopology of Q and constitute Einstein gravity. Q is given by 2T^3+3S^1xS^2, and\nis embedded in four dimensions. This points toward a hidden topological content\nfor general relativity, best phrased as: Q and q provide a structure for how to\nchoose a three-space region irrespective of what geometric properties it has,\nwhile at the same time Q and q determine that only GR can endow a three-space\nwith those geometric properties. In this sense, avoiding the Axiom of Choice\nallows one to gain physical insight into GR. Possible links with holography are\npointed out.\n"}

{"text":"  The production of new spin-1 chiral bosons at the hadron colliders, the\nFermilab Tevatron and the CERN LHC, is considered. The masses of the chiral\nbosons can be determined on the basis of experimental data of precise\nlow-energy experiments, which already indicate indirectly their existence. They\ncan explain, for example, the serious 4.5 sigma discrepancy between the\nmeasured and the predicted two pion branching ratio of the tau decay and the\nsign of the 3.3 sigma deviation of the muon (g-2) theoretical prediction from\nthe experimental value. Quantitative evaluations of the various differential\ncross-sections of the chiral boson production at hadron colliders are made\nusing the CalcHEP package. It is noteworthy that the Tevatron data already hint\nthe existence of the lightest charged chiral boson with a mass around 500 GeV.\nNew Tevatron data and the LHC results will definitely confirm or reject this\nindication. In the positive case the LHC would be able to discover all\npredicted charged and neutral chiral bosons spanning in mass up to 1 TeV.\n"}
{"text":"  We have investigated the peculiar motions of clusters of galaxies in the Ursa\nMajor (UMa) supercluster and its neighborhood. Based on SDSS (Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey) data, we have compiled a sample of early-type galaxies and used their\nfundamental plane to determine the cluster distances and peculiar velocities.\nThe samples of early-type galaxies in the central regions (within R_200) of 12\nUMa clusters of galaxies, in three main subsystems of the supercluster -- the\nfilamentary structures connecting the clusters, and in nine clusters from the\nnearest UMa neighborhood have similar parameters. The fairly high overdensity\n(3 by the galaxy number and 15 by the cluster number) suggests that the\nsupercluster as a whole is gravitationally bound, while no significant peculiar\nmotions have been found: the peculiar velocities do not exceed the measurement\nerrors by more than a factor of 1.5-2. The mean random peculiar velocities of\nclusters and the systematic deviations from the overall Hubble expansion in the\nsupercluster are consistent with theoretical estimates.

{"text":"  Polymer Optical Fiber (POF) can be and are being used in various fields of\napplications. Two of the main fields are the automotive and the home\nentertainment sector. The POF can be applied in several different optical\ncommunication systems as automotive multi-media busses or in-house Ethernet\nsystems.\n  The requirements of bandwidth are increasing very fast in these sectors and\ntherefore solutions that satisfy these demands are of high actuality. One\nsolution is to use the wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) technique. Here,\nseveral different wavelengths can carry information over one POF fiber. All\nwavelengths that are transmitted over the fiber, must be separated at the\nreceiver to regain and redirect the information channels. These separators are\nso-called Demultiplexers.\n  There are several systems available on the market, which are all afflicted\nwith certain disadvantages. But all these solutions have one main disadvantage,\nthey are all too expensive for most of the applications mentioned above. So the\ngoal of this study is to develop an economical Demultiplexer for WDM\ntransmission over POF.\n  The main idea is to separate the chromatic light in its monochromatic\ncomponents with the help of a prism with low reciprocal dispersive power. The\nprism and the other assemblies, which are needed to adjust the optical path,\nshould be manufactured in injection molding technique.

{"text":"  Determination of the cosmic infrared background (CIB) at far infrared\nwavelengths using COBE\/DIRBE data is limited by the accuracy to which\nforeground interplanetary and Galactic dust emission can be modeled and\nsubtracted. Previous determinations of the far infrared CIB (e.g., Hauser et\nal. 1998) were based on the detection of residual isotropic emission in skymaps\nfrom which the emission from interplanetary dust and the neutral interstellar\nmedium were removed. In this paper we use the Wisconsin H-alpha Mapper (WHAM)\nNorthern Sky Survey as a tracer of the ionized medium to examine the effect of\nthis foreground component on determination of the CIB. We decompose the DIRBE\nfar infrared data for five high Galactic latitude regions into H I and H-alpha\ncorrelated components and a residual component. We find the H-alpha correlated\ncomponent to be consistent with zero for each region, and we find that addition\nof an H-alpha correlated component in modeling the foreground emission has\nnegligible effect on derived CIB results. Our CIB detections and 2 sigma upper\nlimits are essentially the same as those derived by Hauser et al. and are given\nby nu I_nu (nW m-2 sr-1) < 75, < 32, 25 +- 8, and 13 +- 3 at 60, 100, 140, and\n240 microns, respectively. Our residuals have not been subjected to a detailed\nanisotropy test, so our CIB results do not supersede those of Hauser et al. We\nderive upper limits on the 100 micron emissivity of the ionized medium that are\ntypically about 40% of the 100 micron emissivity of the neutral atomic medium.\nThis low value may be caused in part by a lower dust-to-gas mass ratio in the\nionized medium than in the neutral medium, and in part by a shortcoming of\nusing H-alpha intensity as a tracer of far infrared emission.\n"}
{"text":"  We have studied a highly variable ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX) in the\nFornax galaxy NGC 1365, with a series of 12 Chandra and XMM-Newton observations\nbetween 2002 and 2006. In 2006 April, the source peaked at a luminosity ~ 3 x\n10^{40} erg\/s in the 0.3-10 keV band (similar to the maximum luminosity found\nby ASCA in 1995), and declined on an e-folding timescale ~ 3 days. The X-ray\nspectrum is always dominated by a broad power-law-like component. When the\nsource is seen at X-ray luminosities ~ 10^{40} erg\/s, an additional soft\nthermal component (which we interpret as emission from the accretion disk)\ncontributes ~ 1\/4 of the X-ray flux; when the luminosity is higher, ~ 3 x\n10^{40} erg\/s, the thermal component is not detected and must contribute < 10%\nof the flux. At the beginning of the decline, ionized absorption is detected\naround 0.5-2 keV; it is a possible signature of a massive outflow. The\npower-law is always hard, with a photon index Gamma ~ 1.7 (and even flatter at\ntimes), as is generally the case with bright ULXs. We speculate that this\nsource and perhaps most other bright ULXs are in a high\/hard state: as the\naccretion rate increases well above the Eddington limit, more and more power is\nextracted from the inner region of the inflow through non-radiative channels,\nand is used to power a Comptonizing corona, jet or wind. The observed thermal\ncomponent comes from the standard outer disk; the transition radius between\nouter standard disk and Comptonizing inner region moves further out and to\nlower disk temperatures as the accretion rate increases. This produces the\nobserved appearance of a large, cool disk. Based on X-ray luminosity and\nspectral arguments, we suggest that this accreting black hole has a likely mass\n~ 50-150 Msun (even without accounting for possible beaming).\n"}
{"text":"  This paper develops a mathematical model describing the influence that\nconjugation-mediated Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT) has on the\nmutation-selection balance in an asexually reproducing population of\nunicellular, prokaryotic organisms. It is assumed that mutation-selection\nbalance is reached in the presence of a fixed background concentration of\nantibiotic, to which the population must become resistant in order to survive.\nWe analyze the behavior of the model in the limit of low and high\nantibiotic-induced first-order death rate constants, and find that the highest\nmean fitness is obtained at low rates of bacterial conjugation. As the rate of\nconjugation crosses a threshold, the mean fitness decreases to a minimum, and\nthen rises asymptotically to a limiting value as the rate of conjugation\nbecomes infinitely large. However, this limiting value is smaller than the mean\nfitness obtained in the limit of low conjugation rate. This dependence of the\nmean fitness on the conjugation rate is fairly small for the parameter ranges\nwe have considered, and disappears as the first-order death rate constant due\nto the presence of antibiotic approaches zero. For large values of the\nantibiotic death rate constant, we have obtained an analytical solution for the\nbehavior of the mean fitness that agrees well with the results of simulations.\nThe results of this paper suggest that conjugation-mediated HGT has a slightly\ndeleterious effect on the mean fitness of a population at mutation-selection\nbalance. Therefore, we argue that HGT confers a selective advantage by allowing\nfor faster adaptation to a new or changing environment. The results of this\npaper are consistent with the observation that HGT can be promoted by\nenvironmental stresses on a population.\n"}

Here we report on results\nof the Serpens survey and compare the three clouds. Average measured angular\ncore sizes and their dependence on resolution suggest that many of the observed\nsources are consistent with power-law density profiles. Tests of the effects of\ncloud distance reveal that linear resolution strongly affects measured source\nsizes and densities, but not the shape of the mass distribution. Core mass\ndistribution slopes in Perseus and Ophiuchus (alpha=2.1+\/-0.1 and\nalpha=2.1+\/-0.3) are consistent with recent measurements of the stellar IMF,\nwhereas the Serpens distribution is flatter (alpha=1.6+\/-0.2).

We sought\nto develop a mathematical approach to this problem using, as a test case, one\nof the most well-studied and clinically important signaling networks in biology\ntoday, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) driven signaling cascade.\nMore specifically, we suggest a method, augmented sparse reconstruction, for\nthe identification of links among nodes of ordinary differential equation (ODE)\nnetworks from a small set of trajectories with different initial conditions.\nOur method builds a system of representation by using a collection of integrals\nof all given trajectories and by attenuating block of terms in the\nrepresentation itself. The system of representation is then augmented with\nrandom vectors, and minimization of the 1-norm is used to find sparse\nrepresentations for the dynamical interactions of each node. Augmentation by\nrandom vectors is crucial, since sparsity alone is not able to handle the large\nerror-in-variables in the representation. Augmented sparse reconstruction\nallows to consider potentially very large spaces of models and it is able to\ndetect with high accuracy the few relevant links among nodes, even when\nmoderate noise is added to the measured trajectories.

{"text":"  In this paper, a novel decoding algorithm for low-density parity-check (LDPC)\ncodes based on convex optimization is presented. The decoding algorithm, called\ninterior point decoding, is designed for linear vector channels. The linear\nvector channels include many practically important channels such as inter\nsymbol interference channels and partial response channels. It is shown that\nthe maximum likelihood decoding (MLD) rule for a linear vector channel can be\nrelaxed to a convex optimization problem, which is called a relaxed MLD\nproblem. The proposed decoding algorithm is based on a numerical optimization\ntechnique so called interior point method with barrier function. Approximate\nvariations of the gradient descent and the Newton methods are used to solve the\nconvex optimization problem. In a decoding process of the proposed algorithm, a\nsearch point always lies in the fundamental polytope defined based on a\nlow-density parity-check matrix.

{"text":"  We calculate the quantum radiation power of black holes which are asymptotic\nto the Einstein-de Sitter universe at spatial and null infinities. We consider\ntwo limiting mass accretion scenarios, no accretion and significant accretion.\nWe find that the radiation power strongly depends on not only the asymptotic\ncondition but also the mass accretion scenario. For the no accretion case, we\nconsider the Einstein-Straus solution, where a black hole of constant mass\nresides in the dust Friedmann universe. We find negative cosmological\ncorrection besides the expected redshift factor. This is given in terms of the\ncubic root of ratio in size of the black hole to the cosmological horizon, so\nthat it is currently of order $10^{-5} (M\/10^{6}M_{\\odot})^{1\/3} (t\/14\n{Gyr})^{-1\/3}$ but could have been significant at the formation epoch of\nprimordial black holes. Due to the cosmological effects, this black hole has\nnot settled down to an equilibrium state. This cosmological correction may be\ninterpreted in an analogy with the radiation from a moving mirror in a flat\nspacetime. For the significant accretion case, we consider the Sultana-Dyer\nsolution, where a black hole tends to increase its mass in proportion to the\ncosmological scale factor. In this model, we find that the radiation power is\napparently the same as the Hawking radiation from the Schwarzschild black hole\nof which mass is that of the growing mass at each moment. Hence, the energy\nloss rate decreases and tends to vanish as time proceeds. Consequently, the\nenergy loss due to evaporation is insignificant compared to huge mass accretion\nonto the black hole. Based on this model, we propose a definition of\nquasi-equilibrium temperature for general conformal stationary black holes.\n"}

{"text":"  Strong evidence for the presence of a warped Keplerian accretion disc in\nNGC4258 (M 106) has been inferred from the kinematics of water masers detected\nat sub-parsec scales.

We found that\nthe Bardeen-Petterson radius is comparable to or smaller than the inner radius\nof the maser disc (independent of the allowed value for the black hole spin\nparameter). Numerical simulations for a wide range of physical conditions have\nshown that the evolution of a misaligned disc due to the Bardeen-Petterson\ntorques usually produces an inner flat disc and a warped transition region with\na smooth gradient in the tilt and twist angles.

{"text":"  We study the influence of the lattice topography and the coupling between\nmotion in different directions, for a three-dimensional Brownian motor based on\ncold atoms in a double optical lattice.

We exhibit new difficulties in both cases, and point out the hidden\nfine tuning of some models. On the other hand, we show that several published\nno-go theorems are based on hypotheses which may be unnecessary, so that the\nspace of possible models is a priori larger. We examine a new route to\nreproduce the MOND physics, in which the field equations are particularly\nsimple outside matter. However, the analysis of the field equations within\nmatter (a crucial point which is often forgotten in the literature) exhibits a\ndeadly problem, namely that they do not remain always hyperbolic.

We use the ferromagnetic Ising model with the high-resolution\nmultiple histogram Monte Carlo (MC) simulation. We show that though the 2D\nbehavior remains dominant at small thicknesses, there is a systematic\ncontinuous deviation of the critical exponents from their 2D values. We observe\nthat in the same range of varying thickness the deviation of the exponent $\\nu$\nis very small from its 2D value, while exponent $\\beta$ suffers a larger\ndeviation. Moreover, as long as the film thickness is fixed, i. e. no finite\nsize scaling is done in the $z$ direction perpendicular to the film, the 3D\nvalues of the critical exponents cannot be attained even with very large (but\nfixed) thickness. The crossover to 3D universality class cannot therefore take\nplace without finite size scaling applied in the $z$ direction, in the limit of\nnumerically accessible thicknesses. From values of exponent $\\alpha$ obtained\nby MC, we estimate the effective dimension of the system. We conclude that with\nregard to the critical behavior, thin films behave as systems with effective\ndimension between 2 and 3.\n"}

{"text":"  We study a particular return map for a class of low dimensional chaotic\nmodels called Kolmogorov Lorenz systems, which received an elegant general\nHamiltonian description and includes also the famous Lorenz63 case, from the\nviewpoint of energy and Casimir balance. In particular it is considered in\ndetail a subclass of these models, precisely those obtained from the Lorenz63\nby a small perturbation on the standard parameters, which includes for example\nthe forced Lorenz case in Ref.[6]. The paper is divided into two parts. In the\nfirst part the extremes of the mentioned state functions are considered, which\ndefine an invariant manifold, used to construct an appropriate Poincare surface\nfor our return map. From the experimental observation of the simple orbital\nmotion around the two unstable fixed points, together with the circumstance\nthat these orbits are classified by their energy or Casimir maximum, we\nconstruct a conceptually simple skeletal dynamics valid within our sub class,\nreproducing quite well the Lorenz map for Casimir. This energetic approach\nsheds some light on the physical mechanism underlying regime transitions. The\nsecond part of the paper is devoted to the investigation of a new type of\nmaximum energy based long term predictions, by which the knowledge of a\nparticular maximum energy shell amounts to the knowledge of the future\n(qualitative) behaviour of the system. It is shown that, in this respect, a\nlocal analysis of predictability is not appropriate for a complete\ncharacterization of this behaviour. A perspective on the possible extensions of\nthis type of predictability analysis to more realistic cases in (geo)fluid\ndynamics is discussed at the end of the paper.\n"}
{"text":"  We perform a detailed study of inverse Compton (IC) emission for a fireball\nundergoing external shock (ES) in either a uniform or a wind-like interstellar\nmedium, and assess the relative importance of IC and synchrotron emissions. We\ndetermine the primary model parameters driving the IC to synchrotron emission\nratio in the case of a short duration central engine. We then investigate the\ncase of ES by a long duration central engine, or delayed external shock (DES),\na model that can account for some of the flares observed in GRB X-ray light\ncurves. We present model predictions, in particular in terms of GeV vs X-ray\nbehavior, and compare them with other models proposed to explain the origin of\nflares. We find that if most of the emission occurs when the fireball is in the\nfast cooling regime, then a substantial GeV emission is expected both for a\nshort (standard ES) and a long (DES) duration central engine activity. In\nparticular, in the context of standard ES we are able to account for the\ndelayed emission observed in GRB940217. In the case of DES, we find that IC\nscattering of X-ray flare photons can produce high energy flares in the GeV\nband, which can be detected by GLAST. The detectability of high energy flares\nimproves with the burst kinetic energy: about 30% of Swift GRBs showing flares\nin their X-ray light curve have sufficiently large kinetic energy so that the\nexpected high flares can be detected by GLAST. One important prediction of the\nDES model is the simultaneity between low and high energy flares. To test this\nsimultaneity, the peak energies of both flares need to fall below or within the\nobservational bands. We predict that X-ray flares with peak energy of ~10 eV\nproduce high energy flares with peak energy of around 100 MeV-GeV.

Here we study population dynamics in a model where fitness can be\ninferred from physical properties of proteins under a physiological assumption\nthat loss of stability of any protein encoded by an essential gene confers a\nlethal phenotype. Accumulation of mutations in organisms containing Gamma genes\ncan then be represented as diffusion within the Gamma dimensional hypercube\nwith adsorbing boundaries which are determined, in each dimension, by loss of a\nprotein stability and, at higher stability, by lack of protein sequences.\nSolving the diffusion equation whose parameters are derived from the data on\npoint mutations in proteins, we determine a universal distribution of protein\nstabilities, in agreement with existing data. The theory provides a fundamental\nrelation between mutation rate, maximal genome size and thermodynamic response\nof proteins to point mutations. It establishes a universal speed limit on rate\nof molecular evolution by predicting that populations go extinct (via lethal\nmutagenesis) when mutation rate exceeds approximately 6 mutations per essential\npart of genome per replication for mesophilic organisms and 1 to 2 mutations\nper genome per replication for thermophilic ones. Further, our results suggest\nthat in absence of error correction, modern RNA viruses and primordial genomes\nmust necessarily be very short.

{"text":"  Time variability of the solar neutrino flux especially in the low and\nintermediate energy sector remains an open question and, if it exists, it is\nlikely to be originated from the magnetic moment transition from active to\nlight sterile neutrinos at times of intense solar activity and magnetic field.\nWe examine the prospects for the SNO+ experiment to address this important\nissue and to distinguish between the two classes of solar models which are\ncurrently identified as corresponding to a high (SSM I) and a low (SSM II)\nheavy element abundance. We also evaluate the predictions from these two models\nfor the Chlorine experiment event rate in the standard LMA and LMA+Spin Flavour\nPrecession (SFP) scenarios. It is found that after three years of SNO+ data\ntaking, the pep flux measurement will be able to discriminate between the\nstandard LMA and LMA+SFP scenarios, independently of which is the correct solar\nmodel. If the LMA rate is measured, SFP with $B_0 \\sim 280kG$ for the resonant\n$\\Delta m^2_{01}$ can be excluded at more than $4\\sigma$. A low rate would\nsignal new physics, excluding all the 90% allowed range of the standard LMA\nsolution at 3$\\sigma$, and a time variability would be a strong signature of\nthe SFP model. The CNO fluxes are the ones for which the two SSM predictions\nexhibit the largest differences, so their measurement at SNO+ will be important\nto favour one or the other. The distinction will be clearer after LMA or SFP\nare confirmed with pep, but still, a CNO measurement at the level of SSM I\/LMA\nwill disfavour SSM II at about $3 \\sigma$.

{"text":"  The interaction of two isotropic turbulent fields of equal integral scale but\ndifferent kinetic energy generates the simplest kind of inhomogeneous turbulent\nfield. In this paper we present a numerical experiment where two time decaying\nisotropic fields of kinetic energies $E_1$ and $E_2$ initially match over a\nnarrow region. Within this region the kinetic energy varies as a hyperbolic\ntangent. The following temporal evolution produces a shearless mixing. The\nanisotropy and intermittency of velocity and velocity derivative statistics is\nobserved. In particular the asymptotic behavior in time and as a function of\nthe energy ratio $E_1\/E_2 \\to \\infty$ is discussed. This limit corresponds to\nthe maximum observable turbulent energy gradient for a given $E_1$ and is\nobtained through the limit $E_2 \\to 0$. A field with $E_1\/E_2 \\to \\infty$\nrepresents a mixing which could be observed near a surface subject to a very\nsmall velocity gradient separating two turbulent fields, one of which is nearly\nquiescent. In this condition the turbulent penetration is maximum and reaches a\nvalue equal to 1.2 times the nominal mixing layer width. The experiment shows\nthat the presence of a turbulent energy gradient is sufficient for the\nappearance of intermittency and that during the mixing process the pressure\ntransport is not negligible with respect to the turbulent velocity transport.\nThese findings may open the way to the hypothesis that the presence of a\ngradient of turbulent energy is the minimal requirement for Gaussian departure\nin turbulence.\n"}

We study these\nmodels under an assumption, akin to the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, in\nwhich the volatility has already relaxed to its equilibrium distribution and\nacts as a background to the evolution of the price process. In this\napproximation, we show that all models of stochastic volatility should exhibit\na scaling relation in the time lag of zero-drift modified log-returns. We\nverify that the Dow-Jones Industrial Average index indeed follows this scaling.\nWe then focus on two popular stochastic volatility models, the Heston and\nHull-White models. In particular, we show that in the Hull-White model the\nresulting probability distribution of log-returns in this approximation\ncorresponds to the Tsallis (t-Student) distribution. The Tsallis parameters are\ngiven in terms of the microscopic stochastic volatility model. Finally, we show\nthat the log-returns for 30 years Dow Jones index data is well fitted by a\nTsallis distribution, obtaining the relevant parameters.\n"}
{"text":"  We present a new control algorithm and system design for a network of quantum\nrepeaters, and outline the end-to-end protocol architecture. Such a network\nwill create long-distance quantum states, supporting quantum key distribution\nas well as distributed quantum computation. Quantum repeaters improve the\nreduction of quantum-communication throughput with distance from exponential to\npolynomial. Because a quantum state cannot be copied, a quantum repeater is not\na signal amplifier, but rather executes algorithms for quantum teleportation in\nconjunction with a specialized type of quantum error correction called\npurification to raise the fidelity of the quantum states. We introduce our\nbanded purification scheme, which is especially effective when the fidelity of\ncoupled qubits is low, improving the prospects for experimental realization of\nsuch systems. The resulting throughput is calculated via detailed simulations\nof a long line composed of shorter hops. Our algorithmic improvements increase\nthroughput by a factor of up to fifty compared to earlier approaches, for a\nbroad range of physical characteristics.\n"}
{"text":"  The peculiar velocity of the Local Group of galaxies manifested in the Cosmic\nMicrowave Background dipole is found to decompose into three dominant\ncomponents. The three components are clearly separated because they arise on\ndistinct spatial scales and are fortuitously almost orthogonal in their\ninfluences. The nearest, which is distinguished by a velocity discontinuity at\n~7 Mpc, arises from the evacuation of the Local Void. We lie in the Local Sheet\nthat bounds the void. Random motions within the Local Sheet are small. Our\nGalaxy participates in the bulk motion of the Local Sheet away from the Local\nVoid. The component of our motion on an intermediate scale is attributed to the\nVirgo Cluster and its surroundings, 17 Mpc away. The third and largest\ncomponent is an attraction on scales larger than 3000 km\/s and centered near\nthe direction of the Centaurus Cluster. The amplitudes of the three components\nare 259, 185, and 455 km\/s, respectively, adding collectively to 631 km\/s in\nthe reference frame of the Local Sheet. Taking the nearby influences into\naccount causes the residual attributed to large scales to align with observed\nconcentrations of distant galaxies and reduces somewhat the amplitude of motion\nattributed to their pull. On small scales, in addition to the motion of our\nLocal Sheet away from the Local Void, the nearest adjacent filament, the Leo\nSpur, is seen to be moving in a direction that will lead to convergence with\nour filament. Finally, a good distance to an isolated galaxy within the Local\nVoid reveals that this dwarf system has a motion of at least 230 km\/s away from\nthe void center. Given the velocities expected from gravitational instability\ntheory in the standard cosmological paradigm, the distance to the center of the\nLocal Void must be at least 23 Mpc from our position.

{"text":"  The \"bubble universes\" of Coleman and De Luccia play a crucial role in string\ncosmology. Since our own Universe is supposed to be of this kind, bubble\ncosmology should supply definite answers to the long-standing questions\nregarding cosmological initial conditions. In particular, it must explain how\nan initial singularity is avoided, and also how the initial conditions for\nInflation were established. We argue that the simplest non-anthropic approach\nto these problems involves a requirement that the spatial sections defined by\ndistinguished bubble observers should not be allowed to have arbitrarily small\nvolumes. Casimir energy is a popular candidate for a quantum effect which can\nensure this, but [because it violates energy conditions] there is a danger that\nit could lead to non-perturbative instabilities in string theory. We make a\nsimple proposal for the initial conditions of a bubble universe, and show that\nour proposal ensures that the system is non-perturbatively stable. Thus,\nlow-entropy conditions can be established at the beginning of a bubble universe\nwithout violating the Second Law of thermodynamics and without leading to\ninstability in string theory. These conditions are inherited from the ambient\nspacetime.\n"}

{"text":"  The scenario that some first-order phase transitions may have taken place in\nthe early Universe offers us one of the most intriguing and fascinating\nquestions in cosmology. Indeed, the role played by the latent \"heat\" or energy\nreleased in the phase transition is highly nontrivial and may lead to some\nsurprising, important results. In this paper, we take the wisdom that the\ncosmological QCD phase transition, which happened at a time between 10^(-5) sec\nand 10^(-4) sec or at the temperature of about 150 MeV and accounts for\nconfinement of quarks and gluons to within hadrons, would be of first order. To\nget the essence out of the scenario, it is sufficient to approximate the true\nQCD vacuum as one of degenerate theta-vacua and when necessary we try to model\nit effectively via a complex scalar field with spontaneous symmetry breaking.\nWe examine how and when \"pasted\" or \"patched\" domain walls are formed, how long\nsuch walls evolve in the long run, and we believe that the significant portion\nof dark matter could be accounted for in terms of such domain-wall structure\nand its remnants. Of course, the cosmological QCD phase transition happened in\nthe way such that the false vacua associated with baryons and many other\ncolor-singlet objects did not disappear (that is, using the bag-model language,\nthere are bags of radius 1.0 fermi for the baryons) - but the amount of the\nenergy remained in the false vacua is negligible. The latent energy released\ndue to the conversion of the false vacua to the true vacua, in the form of\n\"pasted\" or \"patched\" domain walls in the short run and their numerous evolved\nobjects, should make the concept of the \"radiation-dominated\" epoch, or of the\n\"matter-dominated\" epoch to be re-examined.\n"}

{"text":"  We consider the possibility that the dark matter, which is required to\nexplain the dynamics of the neutral hydrogen clouds at large distances from the\ngalactic center, could be in the form of a Bose-Einstein condensate. To study\nthe condensate we use the non-relativistic Gross-Pitaevskii equation. By\nintroducing the Madelung representation of the wave function, we formulate the\ndynamics of the system in terms of the continuity equation and of the\nhydrodynamic Euler equations. Hence dark matter can be described as a\nnon-relativistic, Newtonian Bose-Einstein gravitational condensate gas, whose\ndensity and pressure are related by a barotropic equation of state. In the case\nof a condensate with quartic non-linearity, the equation of state is polytropic\nwith index $n=1$. To test the validity of the model we fit the Newtonian\ntangential velocity equation of the model with a sample of rotation curves of\nlow surface brightness and dwarf galaxies, respectively. We find a very good\nagreement between the theoretical rotation curves and the observational data\nfor the low surface brightness galaxies. The deflection of photons passing\nthrough the dark matter halos is also analyzed, and the bending angle of light\nis computed. The bending angle obtained for the Bose-Einstein condensate is\nlarger than that predicted by standard general relativistic and dark matter\nmodels. Therefore the study of the light deflection by galaxies and the\ngravitational lensing could discriminate between the Bose-Einstein condensate\ndark matter model and other dark matter models.\n"}

The ionised gas\ndistributions show a range of low excitation regions such as star formation\nrings in Seyferts and inactive galaxies, and high excitation regions related to\nphotoionisation by the AGN. The stellar kinematics of all galaxies in the\nsample show regular rotation patterns typical of disc-like systems, with\nkinematic axes which are well aligned with those derived from the outer\nphotometry and which provide a reliable representation of the galactic line of\nnodes. After removal of the non-gravitational components due to e.g. AGN-driven\noutflows, the ionised gas kinematics in both the Seyfert and inactive galaxies\nare also dominated by rotation with global alignment between stars and gas in\nmost galaxies. This result is consistent with previous findings from\nphotometric studies that the large-scale light distribution of Seyfert hosts\nare similar to inactive hosts. However, fully exploiting the two-dimensional\nnature of our spectroscopic data, deviations from axisymmetric rotation in the\ngaseous velocity fields are identified that suggest the gaseous kinematics are\nmore disturbed at small radii in the Seyfert galaxies compared with the\ninactive galaxies, providing a tentative link between nuclear gaseous streaming\nand nuclear activity.\n"}

At the inner edge of the\ninner gas spiral arm the ordered magnetic field is only mildly compressed and\nturns smoothly, to become aligned along the gas arm. Hence the field is not\nshocked and is probably connected to the warm, diffuse gas. At larger radii,\ntwo bright magnetic arms between the optical arms are visible in polarized\nintensity. The field in the northern magnetic arm is almost totally aligned.\nFaraday rotation measures (RM) in these arms are consistent with the\nsuperposition of two low azimuthal dynamo modes. Three more magnetic arms are\ndiscovered in the outer galaxy, located between HI arms. Due to strong Faraday\ndepolarization the galaxy is not transparent to polarized waves at 18cm and\n20cm. The large-scale asymmetry in depolarization with respect to the major\naxis may be another indication of large-scale helical fields.

Quite\ngenerally, the metal-insulator transition is characterized by lattice symmetry\nbreaking but the nature of the insulating Mott state is more complex than a\nsimple Charge Density Wave. Indeed, in the limit of large Coulomb repulsion,\nthe physics can be described in the framework of (extended) quantum\nfully-packed loop or dimer models carrying extra spin degrees of freedom.\nVarious diagonal and off-diagonal plaquette correlation functions are computed\nand the low-energy spectra are analyzed in details in order to characterize the\nnature of the insulating phases.

When either the majority or the minority spin\nband is tuned close to the van Hove filling by a magnetic field, the Fermi\nsurface symmetry breaking occurs in both bands, but with a different magnitude\nof the order parameter. The transition is typically of second order at high\ntemperature and changes to first order at low temperature; the end points of\nthe second order line are tricritical points. This qualitative picture does not\nchange even in the limit of a large magnetic field, although the magnetic field\nsubstantially suppresses the transition temperature at the van Hove filling.\nThe field produces neither a quantum critical point nor a quantum critical end\npoint in our model. In the weak coupling limit, typical quantities\ncharacterizing the phase diagram have a field-independent single energy scale\nwhile its dimensionless coefficient varies with the field. The field-induced\nFermi surface symmetry breaking is a promising scenario for the bilayer\nruthenate Sr3Ru2O7, and future issues are discussed to establish such a\nscenario.\n"}
{"text":"  In this paper, we examine the stability problem for viscous shock solutions\nof the isentropic compressible Navier--Stokes equations, or $p$-system with\nreal viscosity. We first revisit the work of Matsumura and Nishihara, extending\nthe known parameter regime for which small-amplitude viscous shocks are\nprovably spectrally stable by an optimized version of their original argument.\nNext, using a novel spectral energy estimate, we show that there are no purely\nreal unstable eigenvalues for any shock strength.\n  By related estimates, we show that unstable eigenvalues are confined to a\nbounded region independent of shock strength. Then through an extensive\nnumerical Evans function study, we show that there is no unstable spectrum in\nthe entire right-half plane, thus demonstrating numerically that\nlarge-amplitude shocks are spectrally stable up to Mach number $M\\approx 3000$\nfor $1 \\le \\gamma \\leq 3$. This strongly suggests that shocks are stable\nindependent of amplitude and the adiabatic constant $\\gamma$. We complete our\nstudy by showing that finite-difference simulations of perturbed\nlarge-amplitude shocks converge to a translate of the original shock wave, as\nexpected.\n"}
{"text":"  We study theoretically the propagation of a step-modulated optical field as\nit passes through a dispersive dielectric made up of a dilute collection of\noscillators characterized by a single narrow-band resonance. The propagated\nfield is given in terms of an integral of a Fourier type, which cannot be\nevaluated even for simple models of the dispersive dielectric. The fact that\nthe oscillators have a low number density (dilute medium) and have a\nnarrow-band resonance allows us to simplify the integrand. In this case, the\nintegral can be evaluated exactly, although it is not possible using this\nmethod to separate out the transient part of the propagated field known as\noptical precursors. We also use an asymptotic method (saddle-point method) to\nevaluate the integral. The contributions to the integral related to the\nsaddle-points of the integrand give rise to the optical precursors. We obtain\nanalytic expressions for the precursor fields and the domain over which the\nasymptotic method is valid. When combined to obtain the total transient field,\nwe find that the agreement between the solutions obtained by the asymptotic and\nthe exact methods is excellent. Our results demonstrate that precursors can\npersist for many nanoseconds and the chirp in the instantaneous frequency of\nthe precursors can manifest itself in beats in the transmitted intensity. Our\nwork strongly suggests that precursors have been observed in many previous\nexperiments.\n"}
{"text":"  The curvaton scenario for the generation of the cosmological curvature\nperturbation on large scales represents an alternative to the standard\nslow-roll scenario of inflation in which the observed density perturbations are\ndue to fluctuations of the inflaton field itself. Its basic assumption is that\nthe initial curvature perturbation due to the inflaton field is negligible.\nThis is attained by lowering the energy scale of inflation, thereby highly\nsuppressing the amount of gravitational waves produced during inflation. We\ncompute the power-spectrum of the gravitational waves generated at second order\nin perturbation theory by the curvaton (isocurvature) perturbations between the\nend of inflation and the curvaton decay. An interesting property of this\ncontribution to the tensor perturbations is that it is directly proportional to\nthe amount of non-Gaussianity predicted within the curvaton scenario. We show\nthat the spectrum of gravitational waves may be in the range of future\ngravitational wave detectors.\n"}
{"text":"  This paper considers a \"striking outwards\" reed coupled to a resonator. This\nexpression, due to Helmholtz, is not discussed here : it corresponds to the\nmost common model of a lip-type valve, when the valve is assumed to be a one\ndegree of freedom oscillator. The presented work is an extension of the works\ndone by Wilson and Beavers (1974), Tarnopolsky (2000). The range of the playing\nfrequencies is investigated. The first results are analytical : when no losses\nare present in the resonator, it is proven that the ratio between the threshold\nfrequency and the reed resonance frequency is found to be necessarily within\nthe interval between unity and the square root of 3. This is a musical sixth.\nActually the interval is largely smaller, and this is in accordance with e.g.\nthe results by Cullen et al.. The smallest blowing pressure is found to be\ndirectly related to the quality factor of the reed. Numerical results confirm\nthese statements, and are discussed in comparison with previous ones by Cullen\net al (2000).\n"}
{"text":"  By a combination of asymptotic ODE estimates and numerical Evans function\ncalculations, we establish stability of viscous shock solutions of the\nisentropic compressible Navier--Stokes equations with $\\gamma$-law pressure (i)\nin the limit as Mach number $M$ goes to infinity, for any $\\gamma\\ge 1$ (proved\nanalytically), and (ii) for $M\\ge 2,500$, $\\gamma\\in [1,2.5]$ (demonstrated\nnumerically).

{"text":"  Year 2005 was the World Year of Physics, and it was commemorated worldwide as\nthe 100th anniversary of Albert Einstein's legendary works in which the\nfoundations of at least three areas of modern physics were laid: statistical\nmechanics, quantum mechanics and special relativity. These works turned year\n1905 in what deservedly was called the \"miraculous year\" (annus mirabilis) of\nEinstein. However, the influence of this great mind was not limited to science.\nAs it is well known, his fingerprint remains engraved in many aspects of our\ndaily life. Because of that, in this work we have tried to cover almost all the\nsubjects in which Einstein was involved during the last century and, of course,\ntry and reveal the future projection his actions will have in this new century\nthat has just begun. Among the subjects covered in the volume one can find the\npossible connection between Einstein and the artistic vanguard movement, his\nreligiosity, his days in Argentina, the Nobel Prize, the Einstein-Freud\ncorrespondence, his pacifism and the nuclear energy, science and politics under\nthe Second Empire and the Weimar Republic, and even a description of his\npatents and experiments, the studies performed to search for \"built-in\"\nfeatures in his brain and the doubts many had regarding whether Einstein was a\ngenius or a crank. Also included are essays on Einstein and Borges, philosophy\nand relativity, Mach's principle, the relation among science, arts and\nhumanities, and, closer to Einstein's own theoretical research, the twin\nparadox, chance and quantum mechanics, the arrow of time, gravitational lenses,\nstring theory, holography and black holes, gravitomagnetism, superconductivity,\ngravitational waves, the photoelectric effect and the alternative theories for\ngravitation.\n"}
{"text":"  We study two classes of dynamical systems with holes: expanding maps of the\ninterval and Collet-Eckmann maps with singularities.

In addition, we construct an invariant measure $\\nu$,\nsupported on the Cantor set of points that never escape from the system, that\nis ergodic and enjoys exponential decay of correlations for H\\\"{o}lder\nobservables. We show that $\\nu$ satisfies an equilibrium principle which\nimplies that the escape rate formula, familiar to the thermodynamic formalism,\nholds outside the usual setting.

{"text":"  We report on multi-frequency linear polarization monitoring of 15 active\ngalactic nuclei containing highly relativistic jets with apparent speeds from\n$\\sim$4 $c$ to $>40c$. The measurements were obtained at optical, 1 mm, and 3\nmm wavelengths, and at 7 mm with the Very Long Baseline Array. The data show a\nwide range in degree of linear polarization among the sources, from $<$1% to\n$>$30%, and interday polarization variability in individual sources. The\npolarization properties suggest separation of the sample into three groups with\nlow, intermediate, and high variability of polarization in the core at 7 mm :\nLVP, IVP, and HVP, respectively. The groups are partially associated with the\ncommon classification of active galactic nuclei as radio galaxies and quasars\nwith low optical polarization (LVP), BL Lacertae objects (IVP), and highly\noptically polarized quasars (HVP). Our study investigates correlations between\ntotal flux, fractional polarization, and polarization position angle at the\ndifferent wavelengths. We interpret the polarization properties of the sources\nin the sample through models in which weak shocks compress turbulent plasma in\nthe jet. The differences in the orientation of sources with respect to the\nobserver, jet kinematics, and abundance of thermal matter external to the jet\nnear the core can account for the diversity in the polarization properties. The\nresults provide strong evidence that the optical polarized emission originates\nin shocks, most likely situated between the 3 mm and 7 mm VLBI cores. They also\nsupport the idea that the 1 mm core lies at the edge of the transition zone\nbetween electromagnetically dominated and turbulent hydrodynamical sections of\nthe jet.\n"}

Although it is too distant to pose a serious threat as a normal\nsupernova, and given its rotation axis is unlikely to produce a Gamma-Ray Burst\noriented toward the Earth, eta Carinae is about 30,000 times nearer than\n2006gy, and we re-evaluate it as a potential superluminous supernova.

{"text":"  Recent galaxy formation models successfully reproduce the local luminosity\nfunction (LF) of galaxies by invoking mechanisms to suppress star formation in\nlow- and high-mass galaxies. As these models are optimized to fit the LF at low\nredshift, a crucial question is how well they predict the LF at earlier times.\nHere we compare recently measured rest-frame V-band LFs of galaxies at\nredshifts 2.0<z<3.3 to predictions of semianalytic models by De Lucia & Blaizot\nand Bower et al. and hydrodynamic simulations by Dave et al.. The models\nsucceed for some luminosity and redshift ranges and fail for others. A notable\nsuccess is that the Bower et al. model provides a good match to the observed LF\nat z~3. However, all models predict an increase with time of the rest-frame\nV-band luminosity density, whereas the observations show a decrease. The models\nalso have difficulty matching the observed rest-frame colors of galaxies. In\nall models the luminosity density of red galaxies increases sharply from z~3 to\nz~2.2, whereas it is approximately constant in the observations. Conversely, in\nthe models the luminosity density of blue galaxies is approximately constant,\nwhereas it decreases in the observations. These discrepancies cannot be\nentirely remedied by changing the treatment of dust and suggest that current\nmodels do not yet provide a complete description of galaxy formation and\nevolution since z~3.\n"}
{"text":"  At least two arguments suggest that the orbits of a large fraction of binary\nstars and extrasolar planets shrank by 1-2 orders of magnitude after formation:\n(i) the physical radius of a star shrinks by a large factor from birth to the\nmain sequence, yet many main-sequence stars have companions orbiting only a few\nstellar radii away, and (ii) in current theories of planet formation, the\nregion within ~0.1 AU of a protostar is too hot and rarefied for a Jupiter-mass\nplanet to form, yet many \"hot Jupiters\" are observed at such distances. We\ninvestigate orbital shrinkage by the combined effects of secular perturbations\nfrom a distant companion star (Kozai oscillations) and tidal friction. We\nintegrate the relevant equations of motion to predict the distribution of\norbital elements produced by this process. Binary stars with orbital periods of\n0.1 to 10 days, with a median of ~2 d, are produced from binaries with much\nlonger periods (10 d to 10^5 d), consistent with observations indicating that\nmost or all short-period binaries have distant companions (tertiaries). We also\nmake two new testable predictions: (1) For periods between 3 and 10 d, the\ndistribution of the mutual inclination between the inner binary and the\ntertiary orbit should peak strongly near 40 deg and 140 deg. (2) Extrasolar\nplanets whose host stars have a distant binary companion may also undergo this\nprocess, in which case the orbit of the resulting hot Jupiter will typically be\nmisaligned with the equator of its host star.\n"}
{"text":"  Eclipsing planetary systems give us an important window on extrasolar planet\natmospheres. By measuring the depth of the secondary eclipse, when the planet\nmoves behind the star, we can estimate the strength of the thermal emission\nfrom the day side of the planet.

{"text":"  The speed of sound of a Bose-Einstein condensate in an optical lattice is\nstudied both analytically and numerically in all three dimensions.

For the three\ndimensional lattice, the sound speed can even oscillate with the lattice\nstrength. These rich behaviors can be understood in terms of compressibility\nand effective mass. Our analytical results at the limit of weak lattices also\noffer an interesting perspective to the understanding: they show the lattice\ncomponent perpendicular to the sound propagation increases the sound speed\nwhile the lattice components parallel to the propagation decreases the sound\nspeed. The various dependence of the sound speed on the lattice strength is the\nresult of this competition.\n"}

{"text":"  Avalanches, or Avalanche-like, events are often observed in the dynamical\nbehaviour of many complex systems which span from solar flaring to the Earth's\ncrust dynamics and from traffic flows to financial markets.

{"text":"  We apply the general principles of effective field theories to the\nconstruction of effective interactions suitable for few- and many-body\ncalculations in a no-core shell model framework. We calculate the spectrum of\nsystems with three and four two-component fermions in a harmonic trap. In the\nunitary limit, we find that three-particle results are within 10% of known\nsemi-analytical values even in small model spaces. The method is very general,\nand can be readily extended to other regimes, more particles, different species\n(e.g., protons and neutrons in nuclear physics), or more-component fermions (as\nwell as bosons). As an illustration, we present calculations of the\nlowest-energy three-fermion states away from the unitary limit and find a\npossible inversion of parity in the ground state in the limit of trap size\nlarge compared to the scattering length. Furthermore, we investigate the lowest\npositive-parity states for four fermions, although we are limited by the\ndimensions we can currently handle in this case.\n"}
{"text":"  We construct an analytic model for the rate of gas accretion onto a planet\nembedded in a protoplanetary disk as a function of planetary mass, disk\nviscosity, disk scale height, and unperturbed surface density in order to study\nthe long-term accretion and final masses of gas giant planets. We first derive\nan analytical formula for surface density profile near the planetary orbit from\nconsiderations of the balance of force and the dynamical stability. Using it in\nthe empirical formula linking surface density with gas accretion rate that is\nderived based on hydrodynamic simulations of Tanigawa and Watanabe (2002, ApJ\n586, 506), we then simulate the mass evolution of gas giant planets in\nviscously-evolving disks. We finally determine the final mass as a function of\nsemi-major axis of the planet. We find that the disk can be divided into three\nregions characterized by different processes by which the final mass is\ndetermined. In the inner region, the planet grows quickly and forms a deep gap\nto suppress the growth by itself before disk dissipation. The final mass of the\nplanet in this region is found to increase with the semi-major axis in a\nsimilar way to the mass given by the viscous condition for gap opening, but the\nformer is larger by a factor of approximately 10 than the latter. In the\nintermediate region, viscous diffusion of the disk gas limits the gas accretion\nbefore the planet form a deep gap. The final mass can be up to the disk mass,\nwhen disk viscous evolution occurs faster than disk evaporation. In the outer\nregion, planets capture only tiny amounts of gas within the lifetime of the\ndisk to form Neptune-like planets. We derive analytic formulae for the final\nmasses in the different regions and the locations of the boundaries, which are\nhelpful to gain a systematic understanding of the masses of gas giant planets.\n"}
{"text":"  We present a new theoretical model for the luminosity functions (LFs) of\nLyman alpha (Lya) emitting galaxies in the framework of hierarchical galaxy\nformation. We extend a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation that reproduces\na number of observations for local and high-z galaxies, without changing the\noriginal model parameters but introducing a physically-motivated modelling to\ndescribe the escape fraction of Lya photons from host galaxies (f_esc). Though\na previous study using a hierarchical clustering model simply assumed a\nconstant and universal value of f_esc, we incorporate two new effects on f_esc:\nextinction by interstellar dust and galaxy-scale outflow induced as a star\nformation feedback. It is found that the new model nicely reproduces all the\nobserved Lya LFs of the Lya emitters (LAEs) at different redshifts in z ~ 3-6.\nEspecially, the rather surprisingly small evolution of the observed LAE Lya LFs\ncompared with the dark halo mass function is naturally reproduced. Our model\npredicts that galaxies with strong outflows and f_esc ~ 1 are dominant in the\nobserved LFs. This is also consistent with available observations, while the\nsimple universal f_esc model requires f_esc << 1 not to overproduce the\nbrightest LAEs. On the other hand, we found that our model significantly\noverpredicts LAEs at z > 6, and absorption of Lya photons by neutral hydrogen\nin intergalactic medium (IGM) is a reasonable interpretation for the\ndiscrepancy. This indicates that the IGM neutral fraction x_HI rapidly evolves\nfrom x_HI << 1 at z < 6 to a value of order unity at z ~ 6-7, which is broadly\nconsistent with other observational constraints on the reionization history.\n"}
{"text":"  The existence of various anomalous stars, such as the first stars in the\nuniverse or stars produced by stellar mergers, has been recently proposed. Some\nof these stars will result in black hole formation. In this study, we\ninvestigate iron core collapse and black hole formation systematically for the\niron-core mass range of 3 - 30Msun, which has not been studied well so far.\nModels used here are mostly isentropic iron cores that may be produced in\nmerged stars in the present universe but we also employ a model that is meant\nfor a Population III star and is obtained by evolutionary calculation. We solve\nnumerically the general relativistic hydrodynamics and neutrino transfer\nequations simultaneously, treating neutrino reactions in detail under spherical\nsymmetry. As a result, we find that massive iron cores with ~10Msun\nunexpectedly produce a bounce owing to the thermal pressure of nucleons before\nblack hole formation. The features of neutrino signals emitted from such\nmassive iron cores differ in time evolution and spectrum from those of ordinary\nsupernovae. Firstly, the neutronization burst is less remarkable or disappears\ncompletely for more massive models because the density is lower at the bounce.\nSecondly, the spectra of neutrinos, except the electron type, are softer owing\nto the electron-positron pair creation before the bounce. We also study the\neffects of the initial density profile, finding that the larger the initial\ndensity gradient is, the more steeply the neutronization burst declines.\nFurther more, we suggest a way to probe into the black hole progenitors from\nthe neutrino emission and estimate the event number for the currently operating\nneutrino detectors.\n"}
{"text":"  The electric-field-induced resonant spin polarization of a two-dimensional\nhole gas described by Luttinger Hamiltonian with structural inversion asymmetry\nand Zeeman splitting in a perpendicular magnetic field was studied. The spin\npolarization arising from splitting between the light and the heavy hole bands\nshows a resonant peak at a certain magnetic field. Especially, the competition\nbetween the Luttinger term and the structural inversion asymmetry leads to a\nrich resonant peaks structure, and the required magnetic field for the\nresonance may be effectively reduced by enlarging the effective width of the\nquantum well. Furthermore, the Zeeman splitting tends to move the resonant spin\npolarization to a relative high magnetic field and destroy these rich resonant\nspin phenomena. Finally, both the height and the weight of the resonant peak\nincrease as the temperature decreases. It is believed that such resonant spin\nphenomena can be verified in the sample of a two-dimensional hole gas, and it\nmay provide an efficient way to control spin polarization by an external\nelectric field.\n"}
{"text":"  We present Gemini integral field spectroscopy and Keck II longslit\nspectroscopy of the extended emission-line region (EELR) around the quasar 4C\n37.43. The velocity structure of the ionized gas is complex and cannot be\nexplained globally by a simple dynamical model. The spectra from the clouds are\ninconsistent with shock or ``shock + precursor'' ionization models, but they\nare consistent with photoionization by the quasar nucleus. The best-fit\nphotoionization model requires a low-metallicity (12+log(O\/H) < 8.7) two-phase\nmedium, consisting of a matter-bounded diffuse component with a unity\nfilling-factor (N ~ 1 \\cc, T ~ 15000 K), in which are embedded small, dense\nclouds (N ~ 400 \\cc, T ~ 10^4 K). The high-density clouds are transient and can\nbe re-generated through compressing the diffuse medium by low-speed shocks (V_S\n\\lesssim 100 \\kms). Our photoionization model gives a total mass for the\nionized gas of about 3x10^{10} M_sun, and the total kinetic energy implied by\nthis mass and the observed velocity field is ~2x10^{58} ergs. The fact that\nluminous EELRs are confined to steep-spectrum radio-loud quasars, yet show no\nmorphological correspondence to the radio jets, suggests that the driving force\nproducing the 4C 37.43 EELR was a roughly spherical blast wave initiated by the\nproduction of the jet.

{"text":"  We point out a remarkable analogy between the limiting mass of white dwarf\nstars (Chandrasekhar's limit) and the critical mass of bacterial populations in\na generalized Keller-Segel model of chemotaxis [Chavanis & Sire, PRE, 69,\n016116 (2004)]. This model is based on generalized stochastic processes leading\nto the Tsallis statistics. The equilibrium states correspond to polytropic\nconfigurations similar to gaseous polytropes in astrophysics. For the critical\nindex n_3=d\/(d-2) (where d is the dimension of space), the theory of polytropes\nleads to a unique value of the mass M_c that we interpret as a limiting mass.\nIn d=3, we find M_c=202.8956... and in d=2, we recover the well-known result\nM_c=8 pi (in suitable units). For M<M_c, the system evaporates (in an infinite\ndomain) or tends to an equilibrium state (for box-confined configurations). For\nM>M_c, the system collapses and forms a Dirac peak containing a mass M_c\nsurrounded by a halo.

{"text":"  This paper generalizes two previously known techniques for generating\nminimally coupled Einstein-scalar field solutions in 4 dimensions; the Buchdahl\nand Fonarev transformations. By applying this solution generation technique,\nminimally coupled Einstein-scalar field solutions can be generated from vacuum\nsolutions with arbitrary cosmological constant in arbitrary dimension. The only\nrequirement to a seed solution is that it posesses a hypersurface-orthogonal\nKilling vector field. The generalization that allows us to use seed solutions\nwith arbitrary cosmological constant uncovers a new class of Einstein-scalar\nfield solutions that has previously not been studied. We apply the new solution\ntransformation to the (A)dS4 vacuum solution. Transforming the resulting\nEinstein-scalar field solution to the conformal frame, a two-parameter family\nof spatially finite, expanding and accelerating cosmological solutions are\nfound that are conformally isometric to the Einstein static universe RxS^3. We\nstudy null geodesics and find that for any observer, the solution has a\ncosmological horizon at an angular distance of pi\/2 away from the observer. We\nfind that a subset of these solutions can be naturally interpreted as expanding\ncosmologies in which a scalar black hole is formed at late times.

{"text":"  The physics of manganites is often described within an effective two-band\ntight-binding (TB) model for the Mn e_g electrons, which apart from the kinetic\nenergy includes also a local \"Hund's rule\" coupling to the t_{2g} core spin and\na local coupling to the Jahn-Teller (JT) distortion of the oxygen octahedra. We\ntest the validity of this model by comparing the energy dispersion calculated\nfor the TB model with the full Kohn-Sham band-structure calculated within the\nlocal spin-density approximation (LSDA) to density functional theory. We\nanalyze the effect of magnetic order, JT distortions, and \"GdFeO_3-type\"\ntilt-rotations of the oxygen octahedra.

{"text":"  A first principles analysis of order-disorder transition in alloys shows that\nordering energy is a function of temperature due to thermal vibrations.

Ising model and variants are incorrect in explaining alloy\nphase transitions as they ignore the role of electron-phonon interactions\nwithout justification. A theoretical formalism that incorporates the\nDebye-Waller Factor component of electron-phonon interactions in electronic\nstructure calculations already exists and must be adopted when modeling\ntemperature dependent phenomena.

{"text":"  While observational cosmology has recently progressed fast, it revealed a\nserious dilemma called dark energy: an unknown source of exotic energy with\nnegative pressure driving a current accelerating phase of the universe.

We obtain a general\nkinetic equation that can be applied to spatially inhomogeneous systems and\nthat takes into account memory effects. These peculiarities are specific to\nsystems with unshielded long-range interactions. For spatially homogeneous\nsystems with short memory time like plasmas, we recover the classical Landau\n(or Lenard-Balescu) equations.

This enlightens the basic\nphysics and provides novel kinetic equations with a clear physical\ninterpretation. However, unless we restrict ourselves to spatially homogeneous\nsystems, closed kinetic equations can be obtained only if we ignore some\ncollective effects between particles.

{"text":"  The decay $B^0_d \\to D^+ D^-$ offers an interesting probe of CP violation,\nbut requires control of penguin effects, which can be done through $B^0_s \\to\nD^+_s D^-_s$ by means of the $U$-spin flavour symmetry of strong interactions.\nRecently, the Belle collaboration reported indications of large CP violation in\nthe $B^0_d$ decay, which were, however, not confirmed by BaBar, and first\nsignals of the $B^0_s$ channel were observed at the Tevatron. In view of these\ndevelopments and the quickly approaching start of the LHC, we explore the\nallowed region in observable space for CP violation in $B^0_d \\to D^+ D^-$,\nperform theoretical estimates of the relevant hadronic penguin parameters and\nobservables, and address questions both about the most promising strategies for\nthe extraction of CP-violating phases and about the interplay with other\nmeasurements of CP violation and the search for new physics. As far as the\nlatter aspect is concerned, we point out that the $B^0_{q} \\to D_{q}^+ D^-_{q}$\nsystem provides a setting for the determination of the $B^0_q$-$\\bar B^0_q$\nmixing phases ($q\\in\\{d,s\\}$) that is complementary to the conventional\n$B^0_d\\to J\/\\psi K_S$ and $B^0_s\\to J\/\\psi \\phi$ modes with respect to possible\nnew-physics effects in the electroweak penguin sector.\n"}
{"text":"  Spectroscopic observations of the 2006 outburst of the recurrent nova RS\nOphiuchi at both infrared (IR) and X-ray wavelengths have shown that the blast\nwave has decelerated at a higher rate than predicted by the standard\ntest-particle adiabatic shock-wave model. Here we show that the observed\nevolution of the nova remnant can be explained by the diffusive shock\nacceleration of particles at the blast wave and the subsequent escape of the\nhighest energy ions from the shock region. Nonlinear particle acceleration can\nalso account for the difference of shock velocities deduced from the IR and\nX-ray data. The maximum energy that accelerated electrons and protons can have\nachieved in few days after outburst is found to be as high as a few TeV. Using\nthe semi-analytic model of nonlinear diffusive shock acceleration developed by\nBerezhko & Ellison, we show that the postshock temperature of the shocked gas\nmeasured with RXTE\/PCA and Swift\/XRT imply a relatively moderate acceleration\nefficiency.\n"}
{"text":"  Certain integrable models are described by pairs (X,Y) of ADET Dynkin\ndiagrams. At high energy these models are expected to have a conformally\ninvariant limit. The S-matrix of the model determines algebraic equations,\nwhose solutions are mapped to the central charge and scaling dimensions of the\ncorresponding conformal field theory. We study the equations of the (D_m,A_n)\nmodel and find all solutions explicitly using the representation theory of Lie\nalgebras and related Yangians. These mathematically rigorous results are in\nagreement with the expectations arising from physics. We also investigate the\noverlap between certain q-hypergeometric series and modular functions. We study\na particular class of 2-fold q-hypergeometric series, denoted f_{A,B,C}. Here A\nis a positive definite, symmetric, 2x2 matrix, B is a vector of length 2, and C\nis a scalar, all three with rational entries. It turns out that for certain\nchoices of the matrix A, the function f_{A,B,C} can be made modular. We\ncalculate the corresponding values of B and C. It is expected that functions\nf_{A,B,C} arising in this way are characters of some rational conformal field\ntheory. We show that this is true in at least one case.\n"}
{"text":"  By combining experimental measurements of the quasiparticle and dynamical\nmagnetic properties of optimally electron-doped Pr$_{0.88}$LaCe$_{0.12}$CuO$_4$\nwith theoretical calculations we demonstrate that the conventional fermiology\napproach cannot possibly account for the magnetic fluctuations in these\nmaterials. In particular, we perform tunneling experiments on the very same\nsample for which a dynamical magnetic resonance has been reported recently and\nuse photoemission data by others on a similar sample to characterize the\nfermionic quasiparticle excitations in great detail. We subsequently use this\ninformation to calculate the magnetic response within the conventional\nfermiology framework as applied in a large body of work for the hole-doped\nsuperconductors to find a profound disagreement between the theoretical\nexpectations and the measurements: this approach predicts a step-like feature\nrather than a sharp resonance peak, it underestimates the intensity of the\nresonance by an order of magnitude, it suggests an unreasonable temperature\ndependence of the resonance, and most severely, it predicts that most of the\nspectral weight resides in incommensurate wings which are a key feature of the\nhole-doped cuprates but have never been observed in the electron-doped\ncounterparts. Our findings strongly suggest that the magnetic fluctuations\nreflect the quantum-mechanical competition between antiferromagnetic and\nsuperconducting orders.\n"}

Amino acids (aa) are divided\ninto sub-groups with successive derivations, that result in a clustering based\non the considered property. The properties can be user defined or chosen\nbetween default schemes, like those used in the analysis described here.\nStarting from an initial set of the 20 naturally occurring amino acids, they\nare successively divided on the basis of their polarity\/hydrophobic index, with\nincreasing resolution up to four level of subdivision. Other schemes of\nsubdivision are possible: in this thesis work it was employed also a scheme\nbased on physical\/structural properties (solvent exposure, lateral chain\nmobility and secondary structure tendency), that have been compared to the\nchemical scheme with testing purposes. In the method described in this chapter,\nthe total score for each position in the alignment accounts for different\ndegree of similarity between amino acids.

{"text":"  The solar magnetic field is the primary agent that drives solar activity and\ncouples the Sun to the Heliosphere. Although the details of this coupling\ndepend on the quantitative properties of the field, many important aspects of\nthe corona - solar wind connection can be understood by considering only the\ngeneral topological properties of those regions on the Sun where the field\nextends from the photosphere out to interplanetary space, the so-called open\nfield regions that are usually observed as coronal holes. From the simple\nassumptions that underlie the standard quasi-steady corona-wind theoretical\nmodels, and that are likely to hold for the Sun, as well, we derive two\nconjectures on the possible structure and dynamics of coronal holes: (1)\nCoronal holes are unique in that every unipolar region on the photosphere can\ncontain at most one coronal hole. (2) Coronal holes of nested polarity regions\nmust themselves be nested. Magnetic reconnection plays the central role in\nenforcing these constraints on the field topology. From these conjectures we\nderive additional properties for the topology of open field regions, and\npropose several observational predictions for both the slowly varying and\ntransient corona\/solar wind.\n"}
{"text":"  In this paper we investigate tensor modes of perturbations in the universe\ngoverned by Loop Quantum Cosmology. We derive the equation for tensor modes and\ninvestigate numerically effects of quantum corrections. This investigation\nreveals that the region of super-adiabatic amplification of tensor modes is\nsmaller in comparison with the classical case. Neglecting quantum corrections\nto the equation for tensor modes and holding underlying loop dynamics we study\nanalytically the creation of gravitons. We calculate the power spectrum of\ntensor perturbations during the super-inflationary phase induced by Loop\nQuantum Gravity. The main result obtained is the spectrum of gravitons,\nproduced in the transition from the quantum to classical regime of the\nUniverse. Obtained spectrum is characterized by a hard branch. The numerical\ninvestigation shows the strong dependence of $\\nu_{\\text{max}}$ frequency with\nrespect to quantum numbers. The parameter\n$\\Omega_{\\text{gw}}(\\nu_{\\text{max}})$ approaches even to $\\sim 10^{-1}$ for\nhighest frequencies.

{"text":"  Equation for evolution of the four-component Stokes vector in weakly\nanisotropic and smoothly inhomogeneous media is derived on the basis of\nquasi-isotropic approximation of the geometrical optics method, which provides\nconsequent asymptotic solution of Maxwell equations. Our equation generalizes\nprevious results, obtained for the normal propagation of electromagnetic waves\nin stratified media. It is valid for curvilinear rays with torsion and is\ncapable to describe normal modes conversion in the inhomogeneous media.\nRemarkably, evolution of the Stokes vector is described by the\nBargmann-Michel-Telegdi equation for relativistic spin precession, whereas the\nequation for the three-component Stokes vector resembles the Landau-Lifshitz\nequation for spin precession in ferromegnetic systems. General theory is\napplied for analysis of polarization evolution in a magnetized plasma.

{"text":"  The question of the origin of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays at relativistic\nshock waves is discussed in the light of results of recent Monte Carlo studies\nof the first-order Fermi particle acceleration (Niemiec & Ostrowski 2006,\nNiemiec et al. 2006). The models of the turbulent magnetic field near the shock\nconsidered in these simulations include realistic features of the perturbed\nmagnetic field structures at the shock, which allow us to study all the field\nand particle motion characteristics that are important for cosmic-ray\nacceleration. Our results show that turbulent conditions near the shock, that\nare consistent with the shock jump conditions, lead to substantial\nmodifications of the acceleration process with respect to the simplified\nmodels, that produce wide-range power-law energy distributions, often with the\n\"universal\" spectral index. Relativistic shocks are essentially always\nsuperluminal, and thus they preferentially generate steep particle spectra with\ncutoffs well below the maximum scattering energy, often not exceeding the\nenergy of the compressed background plasma ions. Thus, cosmic-ray acceleration\nto very high energies at relativistic shock waves is inefficient, and such\nshocks are not expected to be the sources of ultra-high-energy particles.\n"}
{"text":"  We present preliminary results of Particle-In-Cell simulations of magnetic\nturbulence production by isotropic cosmic-ray ions streaming upstream of\nsupernova remnant shocks. The studies aim at testing the MHD predictions by\nBell (2004, 2005) of a strong amplification of short-wavelength nonresonant\nwave modes and at studying the subsequent evolution of the magnetic turbulence\nand its backreaction on cosmic ray trajectories. The detailed knowledge of the\nupstream turbulence properties is crucial to ascertain all aspects of the shock\nacceleration process - the transport properties of cosmic rays, the shock\nstructure, thermal particle injection and heating processes. An amplification\nof magnetic field would also facilitate the acceleration of particles beyond\nthe \"knee\" in the cosmic-ray spectrum. Our kinetic approach is particularly\nsuited to address the backreaction on the cosmic rays, and it allows us to test\nBell's prediction of the eventual formation of extended filamentary structure\nin the cosmic-ray distribution and also to arrive at a reliable estimate of the\ntotal saturation magnetic-field level. The parameters chosen for the\nsimulations are favorable for the rapid excitation of purely growing modes. We\nconfirm the generation of the turbulent magnetic field due to the drift of\ncosmic-ray ions in the upstream plasma, but show that the growth rate of the\nfield perturbations is much slower than estimated using the MHD approach and\nthe amplitude of the turbulence saturates at about dB\/B~1.

After showing that ghost\ncontributions to the correlators can be generally expressed in terms of Schur\npolynomials we solve Aomoto integrals in the complex plane, a new set of\nmultiple integrals of Dotsenko-Fateev type. We then make use of monodromy\ninvariance to analytically continue the number of screening operators and prove\nthat this procedure gives results in complete agreement with the amplitudes\nobtained from the bootstrap approach. We also compute a four-point function\ninvolving a spectral flow operator and we verify that it leads to the one unit\nspectral flow three-point function according to a prescription previously\nproposed in the literature. In addition, we present an alternative method to\nobtain spectral flow non-conserving n-point functions through well defined\noperators and we prove that it reproduces the exact correlators for n=3.\nIndependence of the result on the insertion points of these operators suggests\nthat it is possible to violate winding number conservation modifying the\nbackground charge.\n"}
{"text":"  HET Optical spectra covering the evolution from about 6 days before to about\n5 weeks after maximum light and the ROTSE-IIIb unfiltered light curve of the\n\"Branch-normal\" Type Ia Supernova SN 2005hj are presented. The host galaxy\nshows HII region lines at redshift of z=0.0574, which puts the peak unfiltered\nabsolute magnitude at a somewhat over-luminous -19.6. The spectra show weak and\nnarrow SiII lines, and for a period of at least 10 days beginning around\nmaximum light these profiles do not change in width or depth and they indicate\na constant expansion velocity of ~10,600 km\/s. We analyzed the observations\nbased on detailed radiation dynamical models in the literature.

Pulsating delayed detonations and merger scenarios form\nshell-like density structures with properties mostly related to the mass of the\nshell, M_shell, and we discuss how these models may explain the observed SiII\nline evolution; however, these models are based on spherical calculations and\nother possibilities may exist.

{"text":"  Based on the fact that the underpotential electrochemical deposition of Ag\natoms on the $Au(100)$ surface exhibits sharp first-order phase transitions at\nwell-defined values of the (coexistence) chemical potential ($\\mu_{coex}$), we\nperformed extensive simulations aimed at investigating the hysteretic dynamic\nbehavior of the system close to coexistence upon the application of a periodic\nsignal of the form $\\mu(t) = \\mu_{coex} + \\mu_{o}sin(2\\Pi t\/\\tau) $, where\n$\\mu_{o}$ and $\\tau$ are the amplitude and the period of the sweep,\nrespectively. For relatively short periods and small enough amplitudes the\nsystem becomes trapped either at low or high Ag coverage states, as evidenced\nby recording hysteresis loops. This scenario is identified as dynamically\nordered states (DOS), such that the relaxation time $(\\tau_{relax})$ of the\ncorresponding metastable state obeys $\\tau_{relax} > \\tau $. On the other hand,\nby properly increasing $\\mu_{o}$ or\/and $\\tau$, one finds that the $Ag$\ncoverage gently follows the external drive (here $\\tau_{relax} < \\tau $) and\nthe system is said to enter into dynamically disordered states (DDS), where\nhysteresis loops show almost symmetric limiting cycles. This symmetry breaking\nbetween limiting cycles driven by an external signal is discussed in terms of\nthe concept of (out-of-equilibrium) Dynamic Phase Transitions between DOS and\nDDS, similar to those encountered when a magnetic system is placed in the\npresence of a variable external magnetic field. However, a careful finite-size\nscaling study reveals that, at least at $T = 300K$, the $Ag\/Au(100)$ system\ndoes not exhibit true second-order phase transitions but rather a crossover\nbehavior between states. A diagram showing the location of the ordered and\ndisordered states in the $\\mu$ versus $\\tau$ plane is obtained and discussed.\n"}
{"text":"  The propagation of damage in a confined magnetic Ising film, with short range\ncompeting magnetic fields ($h$) acting at opposite walls, is studied by means\nof Monte Carlo simulations. Due to the presence of the fields, the film\nundergoes a wetting transition at a well defined critical temperature $T_w(h)$.\nIn fact, the competing fields causes the occurrence of an interface between\nmagnetic domains of different orientation. For $T < T_w(h)$ ($T > T_w(h)$) such\ninterface is bounded (unbounded) to the walls, while right at $T_w(h)$ the\ninterface is essentially located at the center of the film.\n  It is found that the spatio-temporal spreading of the damage becomes\nconsiderably enhanced by the presence of the interface, which act as a\n''catalyst'' of the damage causing an enhancement of the total damaged area.\nThe critical points for damage spreading are evaluated by extrapolation to the\nthermodynamic limit using a finite-size scaling approach.

Such a critical\npoints are found to be placed within the non-wet phase.\n"}
{"text":"  We study the Stokes-Einstein (SE) and the Stokes-Einstein-Debye (SED)\nrelations using molecular dynamics simulations of the extended simple point\ncharge model of water. We find that both the SE and SED relations break down at\nlow temperature. To explore the relationship between these breakdowns and\ndynamical heterogeneities (DH), we also calculate the SE and SED relations for\nsubsets of the 7% ``fastest'' and 7% ``slowest'' molecules. We find that the SE\nand SED relations break down in both subsets, and that the breakdowns occur on\nall scales of mobility. Thus these breakdowns appear to be generalized\nphenomena, in contrast with the view where only the most mobile molecules are\nthe origin of the breakdown of the SE and SED relations, embedded in an\ninactive background where these relations hold. At low temperature, the SE and\nSED relations in both subsets of molecules are replaced with ``fractional'' SE\nand SED relations, $D_t\\sim(\\tau\/T)^{-\\xi_t}$ and $D_r\\sim(\\tau\/T)^{-\\xi_r}$\nwhere $\\xi_t\\approx0.84<1$ and $\\xi_r\\approx0.75<1$.

We also\nfind that when the decoupling increases, upon cooling, the probability of a\nmolecule being classified as both translationally and rotationally fastest also\nincreases. To study the effect of time scale for SE and SED breakdown and\ndecoupling, we introduce a time-dependent version of the SE and SED relations,\nand a time-dependent function that measures the extent of decoupling. Our\nresults suggest that both the decoupling and SE and SED breakdowns are\noriginated at the time scale corresponding to the end of the cage regime, when\ndiffusion starts. This is also the time scale when the DH are more relevant.\n"}
{"text":"  Network tomography has been regarded as one of the most promising\nmethodologies for performance evaluation and diagnosis of the massive and\ndecentralized Internet.

We show that for a simple Gaussian tomography model,\nthere is an optimal set of one-dimensional projections such that the estimator\nobtained from these projections is asymptotically as efficient as the maximum\nlikelihood estimator based on the joint distribution of the observed data. For\npractical applications, we carry out simulation studies of the proposed method\nfor two instances of network tomography. The first is for traffic demand\ntomography using a Gaussian Origin-Destination traffic model with a power\nrelation between its mean and variance, and the second is for network delay\ntomography where the link delays are to be estimated from the end-to-end path\ndelays.

{"text":"  We study the distinct effects of Dark Matter and Dark Energy on the future\nevolution of nearby large scale structures using constrained N-body\nsimulations. We contrast a model of Cold Dark Matter and a Cosmological\nConstant (LCDM) with an Open CDM (OCDM) model with the same matter density\nOmega_m =0.3 and the same Hubble constant h=0.7. Already by the time the scale\nfactor increased by a factor of 6 (29 Gyr from now in LCDM; 78 Gyr from now in\nOCDM) the comoving position of the Local Group is frozen. Well before that\nepoch the two most massive members of the Local Group, the Milky Way and\nAndromeda, will merge. However, as the expansion rates of the scale factor in\nthe two models are different, the Local Group will be receding in physical\ncoordinates from Virgo exponentially in a LCDM model and at a roughly constant\nvelocity in an OCDM model. More generally, in comoving coordinates the future\nlarge scale structure will look like a sharpened image of the present\nstructure: the skeleton of the cosmic web will remain the same, but clusters\nwill be more `isolated' and the filaments will become thinner. This implies\nthat the long-term fate of large scale structure as seen in comoving\ncoordinates is determined primarily by the matter density. We conclude that\nalthough the LCDM model is accelerating at present due to its Dark Energy\ncomponent while the OCDM model is non accelerating, their large scale structure\nin the future will look very similar in comoving coordinates.\n"}

Over a period of three months, the Cassini\nUltraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS) observed a dramatic variation in the\naverage torus composition. Superimposed on this long-term variation, is a\n10.07-hour periodicity caused by an azimuthal variation in plasma composition\nsubcorotating relative to System III longitude. Quite surprisingly, the\namplitude of the azimuthal variation appears to be modulated at the beat\nfrequency between the System III period and the observed 10.07-hour period.\nPreviously, we have successfully modeled the months-long compositional change\nby supposing a factor of three increase in the amount of material supplied to\nIo's extended neutral clouds. Here, we extend our torus chemistry model to\ninclude an azimuthal dimension. We postulate the existence of two azimuthal\nvariations in the number of super-thermal electrons in the torus: a primary\nvariation that subcorotates with a period of 10.07 hours and a secondary\nvariation that remains fixed in System III longitude. Using these two hot\nelectron variations, our model can reproduce the observed temporal and\nazimuthal variations observed by Cassini UVIS.\n"}

As the neutral primordial gas is a poor radiator at\ntemperatures (T\\le10^4\\unit{K}), molecular hydrogen is needed for further\ncooling down to temperatures (T\\sim100\\unit{K}). The formation of molecular\nhydrogen is catalyzed by the presence of free electrons, which could be\nprovided by the ionization due to an early population of cosmic rays. In order\nto investigate this possibility we developed a code to study the effects of\nionizing cosmic rays on the thermal and chemical evolution of primordial gas.\nWe found that cosmic rays can provide enough free electrons needed for the\nformation of molecular hydrogen, and therefore can increase the cooling ability\nof such primordial gas under following conditions: A dissociating photon flux\nwith (F<10^{-18}\\unit{erg cm^{-2} Hz^{-1} s^{-1}}), initial temperature of the\ngas (\\sim10^{3}\\unit{K}), total gas number densities (n\\ge1\\unit{cm^{-3}}),\nCosmic ray sources with (\\dot{\\epsilon}_{CR}>10^{-33}\\unit{erg cm^{-3}\ns^{-1}}).\n"}
{"text":"  RX J1856.5-3754 is one of the brightest, nearby isolated neutron stars, and\nconsiderable observational resources have been devoted to its study.

{"text":"  Aims: We describe a fast, robust and automatic detection algorithm, TRUFAS,\nand apply it to data that are being expected from the CoRoT mission. Methods:\nThe procedure proposed for the detection of planetary transits in light curves\nworks in two steps: 1) a continuous wavelet transformation of the detrended\nlight curve with posterior selection of the optimum scale for transit\ndetection, and 2) a period search in that selected wavelet transformation. The\ndetrending of the light curves are based on Fourier filtering or a discrete\nwavelet transformation. TRUFAS requires the presence of at least 3 transit\nevents in the data. Results: The proposed algorithm is shown to identify\nreliably and quickly the transits that had been included in a standard set of\n999 light curves that simulate CoRoT data. Variations in the pre-processing of\nthe light curves and in the selection of the scale of the wavelet transform\nhave only little effect on TRUFAS' results. Conclusions: TRUFAS is a robust and\nquick transit detection algorithm, especially well suited for the analysis of\nvery large volumes of data from space or ground-based experiments, with long\nenough durations for the target-planets to produce multiple transit events.\n"}

This has\nimportance, for example, in quantum mechanics, random matrix theory and fluid\ndynamics.\n  The occurence of pseudospectra for non-selfadjoint semiclassical differential\noperators is due to the existence of quasimodes, i.e., approximate local\nsolutions to the eigenvalue problem. For scalar operators, the quasimodes\nappear since the bracket condition is not satisfied for topological reasons,\nsee the paper by Dencker, Sjostrand and Zworski in Comm. Pure Appl.

{"text":"  We study Gauge-Higgs unification model on the orbifold $S^{1}\/Z_{2}$ based on\nthe extended SM gauge group $G_{SM}^{ex}=SU(2)_{L} \\times U(1)_{Y} \\times\nSO(3)_{F}$. The group $SO(3)_{F}$ is treated as a chiral gauged flavour\nsymmetry. Electroweak-, flavour- and Higgs interactions are unified in one\nsingle gauge group SU(7) which is broken again down to $G_{SM}^{ex}$ by\norbifolding and imposing additional boundary conditions. The compactification\nscale is O(1) TeV. The orbifold $S^{1}\/Z_{2}$ is put on a lattice. This setting\ngives a staring point for RG-transformations. As a result the bulk is\nintegrated out and the extra dimension consist of only two points: the orbifold\nfixed points. Parallel transporters (PT) in the extra dimension become\nnonunitary as a result of the blockspin transformations. In addition, a Higgs\npotential emerges naturally. The PTs can be written as a product $e^{A_{y}}\ne^{\\eta} e^{A_{y}}$ of unitary factors $e^{A_{y}}$ and a selfadjoint factor\n$e^{\\eta}$. The reduction $48 \\to 35 + 6 + \\bar{6} + 1$ of the adjoint reps of\nSU(7) with respect to $SU(6) \\supset G_{SM}^{ex}$ leads to three $SU(2)_{L}$\nHiggs doublets: one for each flavour. Their zero modes serve as a substitute\nfor the SM Higgs. When $G_{SM}^{ex}$ is spontaneously broken down to\n$U(1)_{em}$, an exponential gauge boson mass splitting occurs naturally. This\nbreaking leads to $SO(3)_{F}$ flavour gauge boson masses much above the\ncompactification scale. Thus tree-level FCNC are naturally suppressed. Making\nsome simplifying assumptions we also calculate fermion masses and CKM mixing\nangles. As for the gauge bosons an exponential fermion mass splitting occurs\nnaturally.

This equation\nis valid at order 1\/N in a proper thermodynamic limit and it coincides with the\nkinetic equation obtained from the BBGKY hierarchy. For N tending to infinity,\nit reduces to the Vlasov equation describing collisionless systems.

For some galaxies they agree with observations of\nother species, but sometimes (NGC 4535) the magnetic field is the only tracer\nof the interaction with the cluster environment.

{"text":"  The analysis of SN1987A led Brown and Bethe (1995) to conclusion, that the\nmaximum mass of cold neutron stars is low, M_max ~ 1.5M_sun. Such a low M_max,\ndue to a kaon condensation in the stellar core, implies collapse of a too\nmassive deleptonized protoneutron star into a black hole. This would naturally\nexplain the lack of a neutron star in the SN1987A remnant. On the other hand,\nrecent evaluation of mass of PSR J0751+1807 gives M_max > 2M_sun. This\ncontradicts the original Bethe-Brown model, but can be reconciled within\nscenarios proposed in the present Letter. We consider two types of dense matter\nmodels with high-density softening, due to a transition from a non-strange\nN-phase of matter to a strangeness carrying phase S: kaon condensation and\ndeconfinement of quarks. Two scenarios of neutron star formation in stellar\ncore collapse are considered. In the first scenario, realized in sufficiently\nhot and dense supernova cores, nucleation of an S-phase is sufficiently rapid\nso as to form an S-phase core, and implying M_max = M^S_max =~ 1.5M_sun. In the\nsecond scenario, nucleation of the S-phase at neutron star birth is too slow to\nmaterialize, and the star becomes cold without forming an S-phase core. Then,\nstellar mass can increase via accretion, until central density \\rho_crit is\nreached, and the S phase forms. This N branch of neutron stars ends at\nM=M_crit. We select several models of N-phase satifying the necessary condition\nM^N_max > 2M_sun and combine them with models of kaon condensation and quark\ndeconfinement. For kaon condensation, we get M_crit =~ M^S_max =~ 1.5M_sun,\nwhich is ruled out by PSR J0751+1807. On the contrary, for the EOSs with quark\ndeconfinement we get M_crit =~ M^N_max > 2M_sun, which reconciles SN1987A and\nPSR J0751+1807.\n"}

Second, at each step of the timed run, the monadic difference\nformula is modified by computing a quotient with the state and time of that\nstep.

The algorithm is\ncomplete in a very strong sense on a subclass of temporal formulae\ncharacterized as homogeneously monadic and it is approximate on other formulae.\nThe approximation comes from the fact that not all unsatisfiable or\ntautological formulae are recognised at the earliest possible time of the\nruntime verification.\n  Contrary to existing approaches, the presented algorithms do not work by\nsyntactic rewriting but employ efficient decision structures which make them\napplicable in real applications within for instance business software.\n"}
{"text":"  Conformation of single polyelectrolytes in tetravalent salt solutions is\ninvestigated under the framework of a coarse-grained model, using Langevin\ndynamics simulations. The chain size, studied by the radius of gyration, shows\nthree different variational behaviors with salt concentration, depending on the\nchain stiffness. According to these behaviors, polyelectrolytes of fixed chain\nlength are classified into three categories: flexible chain, semiflexible\nchain, and rigid chain. The worm-like chain model with persistence length\npredicted by the Odijk-Skolnick-Fixman theory is found to be able to\nqualitatively describe the end-to-end distance at low salt concentration. In a\nlow-salt region, a flexible polyelectrolyte extends more significantly than a\nsemiflexible chain, and in a high-salt region, regardless of chain stiffness, a\nchain attains a dimension comparable to that of its neutral polymer. The chain\nstiffness influences both the local and the global chain structures. A flexible\nchain exhibits a zigzagged local structure in the presence of salt ions and the\ncondensed structure is a disordered, random globule. A semiflexible chain is\nlocally smooth, and the condensed structure is orderly packed, taking a form\nsuch as hairpin or toroid. Moreover, the chain stiffness can also affect the\nnature of the coil-globule transition. The transition is occurred in a discrete\nmanner for semiflexible chain, whereas in a continuous way for flexible chain.\nThis discrete feature is happened not only at low salt concentration when a\nsemiflexible chain is collapsed, but also at high salt concentration when the\ncollapsed chain is reexpanded. At the end, the effects of chain stiffness and\nsalt concentration on the conformation of single polyelectrolytes are\nsummarized in a schematic state diagram.\n"}

During storage, the E orientalis population\ndecreases gradually and it disappears completely in less than two months after\nthe beginning of storage. E. Vuilleti population becomes gradually more\nimportant than D. basalis population which regress until less than 10 % of the\nemerging parasitoids. E vuilleti adopts ovicide and larvicide behaviour against\nD. Basalis. This behaviour explains its population regression inside granaries.\nIf the aggressive behaviour of this Eupelmidae is a constant, that could also\nexplain the disappearance of E orientalis. However if this species is\nmaintained in stocks, it would be an effective control agent of bruchids\naccording to their parasitic capacities. This study shows that ovicide and\nlarvicide behaviour of E vuilleti is not expressed against E orientalis. When\nthe females have exclusively the hosts already parasitized by E orientalis,\nthey do not lay eggs. The disappearance of E orientalis could not thus be\nexplained by the presence of E. vuilleti.\n"}
{"text":"  This letter concentrates on the non-equilibrium evolution of magnetic field\nstructures at the onset of recombination, when the charged particle current\ndensities decay as neutrals are formed.\n  We consider the effect that a decaying magnetic flux has on the acceleration\nof particles via the transient induced electric field. Since the residual\ncharged-particle number density is small as a result of decoupling, we shall\nconsider the magnetic and electric fields essentially to be imposed, neglecting\nthe feedback from any minority accelerated population.\n  We find that the electromagnetic treatment of this phase transition can\nproduce energetic electrons scattered throughout the Universe. Such particles\ncould have a significant effect on cosmic evolution in several ways: (i) their\npresence could delay the effective end of the recombination era; (ii) they\ncould give rise to plasma concentrations that could enhance early gravitational\ncollapse of matter by opposing cosmic expansion to a greater degree than\nneutral matter could; (iii) they could continue to be accelerated, and become\nthe seed for reionisation at the later epoch $z \\approx 10$.\n"}
{"text":"  Selective control in a population is the ability to control a member of the\npopulation while leaving the other members relatively unaffected. The concept\nof selective control is developed using cell death or apoptosis in\nheterogeneous cell populations as an example. Apoptosis signaling in\nheterogeneous cells is described by an ensemble of gene networks with identical\ntopology but different link strengths. Selective control depends on the\nstatistics of signaling in the ensemble of networks and we analyse the effects\nof superposition, non-linearity and feedback on these statistics. Parallel\npathways promote normal statistics while series pathways promote skew\ndistributions which in the most extreme cases become log-normal. We also show\nthat feedback and non-linearity can produce bimodal signaling statistics, as\ncan discreteness and non-linearity. Two methods for optimizing selective\ncontrol are presented. The first is an exhaustive search method and the second\nis a linear programming based approach. Though control of a single gene in the\nsignaling network yields little selectivity, control of a few genes typically\nyields higher levels of selectivity. The statistics of gene combinations\nsusceptible to selective control is studied and is used to identify general\ncontrol strategies. We found that selectivity is promoted by acting on the\nleast sensitive nodes in the case of weak populations, while selective control\nof robust populations is optimized through perturbations of more sensitive\nnodes. High throughput experiments with heterogeneous cell lines could be\ndesigned in an analogous manner, with the further possibility of incorporating\nthe selectivity optimization process into a closed-loop control system.\n"}
{"text":"  Bacterial chemotaxis in Escherichia coli is a canonical system for the study\nof signal transduction. A remarkable feature of this system is the coexistence\nof precise adaptation in population with large fluctuating cellular behavior in\nsingle cells (Korobkova et al. 2004, Nature, 428, 574). Using a stochastic\nmodel, we found that the large behavioral variability experimentally observed\nin non-stimulated cells is a direct consequence of the architecture of this\nadaptive system. Reversible covalent modification cycles, in which methylation\nand demethylation reactions antagonistically regulate the activity of\nreceptor-kinase complexes, operate outside the region of first-order kinetics.\nAs a result, the receptor-kinase that governs cellular behavior exhibits a\nsigmoidal activation curve. This curve simultaneously amplifies the inherent\nstochastic fluctuations in the system and lengthens the relaxation time in\nresponse to stimulus. Because stochastic fluctuations cause large behavioral\nvariability and the relaxation time governs the average duration of runs in\nresponse to small stimuli, cells with the greatest fluctuating behavior also\ndisplay the largest chemotactic response. Finally, Large-scale simulations of\ndigital bacteria suggest that the chemotaxis network is tuned to simultaneously\noptimize the random spread of cells in absence of nutrients and the cellular\nresponse to gradients of attractant.\n"}
{"text":"  We study the late evolution of solar metallicity stars in the transition\nregion between white dwarf formation and core collapse. This includes the\nsuper-asymptotic giant branch (super-AGB, SAGB) stars, which have massive\nenough cores to ignite carbon burning and form an oxygen-neon (ONe) core. The\nmost massive SAGB stars have cores that may grow to the Chandrasekhar mass\nbecause of continued shell-burning. Their cores collapse, triggering a so\ncalled electron capture supernovae (ECSN). From stellar evolution models we\nfind that the initial mass range for SAGB evolution is 7.5 ... 9.25\\msun. We\nperform calculations with three different stellar evolution codes to\ninvestigate the sensitivity of this mass range to some of the uncertainties in\ncurrent stellar models. The mass range significantly depends on the treatment\nof semiconvective mixing and convective overshooting. To consider the effect of\na large number of thermal pulses, as expected in SAGB stars, we construct\nsynthetic SAGB models that include a semi-analytical treatment of dredge-up,\nhot-bottom burning, and thermal pulse properties. This synthetic model enables\nus to compute the evolution of the main properties of SAGB stars from the onset\nof thermal pulses until the core reaches the Chandrasekhar mass or is uncovered\nby the stellar wind. Thereby, we determine the stellar initial mass ranges that\nproduce ONe-white dwarfs and electron-capture supernovae. The latter is found\nto be 9.0 ... 9.25\\msun for our fiducial model, implying that electron-capture\nsupernovae would constitute about 4% of all supernovae in the local universe.\nOur synthetic approach allows us to explore the uncertainty of this number\nimposed by uncertainties in the third dredge-up efficiency and ABG mass loss\nrate.

{"text":"  Many condensed matter systems are such that their collective excitations at\nlow energies can be described by fields satisfying equations of motion formally\nindistinguishable from those of relativistic field theory. The finite speed of\npropagation of the disturbances in the effective fields (in the simplest\nmodels, the speed of sound) plays here the role of the speed of light in\nfundamental physics. However, these apparently relativistic fields are immersed\nin an external Newtonian world (the condensed matter system itself and the\nlaboratory can be considered Newtonian, since all the velocities involved are\nmuch smaller than the velocity of light) which provides a privileged coordinate\nsystem and therefore seems to destroy the possibility of having a perfectly\ndefined relativistic emergent world. In this essay we ask ourselves the\nfollowing question: In a homogeneous condensed matter medium, is there a way\nfor internal observers, dealing exclusively with the low-energy collective\nphenomena, to detect their state of uniform motion with respect to the medium?\nBy proposing a thought experiment based on the construction of a\nMichelson-Morley interferometer made of quasi-particles, we show that a real\nLorentz-FitzGerald contraction takes place, so that internal observers are\nunable to find out anything about their `absolute ' state of motion. Therefore,\nwe also show that an effective but perfectly defined relativistic world can\nemerge in a fishbowl world situated inside a Newtonian (laboratory) system.\nThis leads us to reflect on the various levels of description in physics, in\nparticular regarding the quest towards a theory of quantum gravity.\n"}

We thus derive new bounds on the radiative\nneutrino lifetime using the high precision cosmic microwave background spectral\ndata collected by the Far Infrared Absolute Spectrophotometer instrument on\nboard of Cosmic Background Explorer. The lower bound on the lifetime is between\na few x 10^19 s and 5 x 10^20 s, depending on the neutrino mass ordering and on\nthe absolute mass scale.

{"text":"  There exists the standard quantum limit (SQL), derived from Heisenberg's\nuncertainty relation, in the sensitivity of laser interferometer\ngravitational-wave detectors.

So far, signal recycling, which is one of\nthe methods to overcome SQL, is considered only in a recombined-type\ninterferometer such as Advanced-LIGO, LCGT, and GEO600. In this paper, we\ninvestigated quantum noise and the possibility of signal recycling in a\ndifferential-type interferometer.

This is significantly cooler than the 35 mK\nspin temperature of the Zeeman reservoir. Equilibration of the two reservoirs\nresults in a 50 % increase in the NMR signal intensity, corresponding to a\nZeeman spin temperature of 23 mK. In order to achieve this polarization\ndirectly, it was necessary to irradiate the sample with microwaves for 1500 s.\nCooling of the dipolar reservoir occurs during polarization transport through\nthe magnetic field gradient around the paramagnetic impurity, and is rapidly\ncommunicated to the bulk by dipolar spin diffusion. As dipolar spin diffusion\nis significantly faster than Zeeman spin diffusion, the bulk dipolar reservoir\ncools faster than the Zeeman reservoir. This process can be exploited to\nrapidly polarize the nuclear spins, by repeatedly cooling the dipolar system\nand transferring the polarization to the Zeeman reservoir.\n"}

Here, we investigate the in silico evolution of modularity and\nrobustness in complex artificial metabolic networks that encode an increasing\namount of information about their environment while acquiring ubiquitous\nfeatures of biological, social, and engineering networks, such as scale-free\nedge distribution, small-world property, and fault-tolerance. These networks\nevolve in environments that differ in their predictability, and allow us to\nstudy modularity from topological, information-theoretic, and gene-epistatic\npoints of view using new tools that do not depend on any preconceived notion of\nmodularity. We find that for our evolved complex networks as well as for the\nyeast protein-protein interaction network, synthetic lethal pairs consist\nmostly of redundant genes that lie close to each other and therefore within\nmodules, while knockdown suppressor pairs are farther apart and often straddle\nmodules, suggesting that knockdown rescue is mediated by alternative pathways\nor modules.

Secondly, the application and\navailability of the elastic theory of low-dimensional continua in\nbio-structures, including short DNA rings, lipid membranes, and cell membranes,\nare discussed. The kink stability of short DNA rings is addressed by using the\ntheory of Kirchhoff rod, Helfrich rod, and bending-soften rod. The lipid\nmembranes obey the theory of fluid membrane. A cell membrane is simplified as a\ncomposite shell of lipid bilayer and membrane skeleton, which is a little\nsimilar to the solid shell. It is found that the membrane skeleton enhances\nhighly the mechanical stability of cell membranes.

Galaxies without individual detections at\n24micron were not well-detected at 70micron and 160micron even through\nstacking. We find that the average IR SEDs of z~0.7 star-forming galaxies fall\nwithin the diversity of z~0 templates. While dust obscuration Lir\/Luv seems to\nbe only a function of star formation rate (SFR; ~ Lir+Luv), not of redshift,\nthe dust temperature of star-forming galaxies (with SFR ~ 10 solar mass per\nyear) at a given IR luminosity was lower at z~0.7 than today. We suggest an\ninterpretation of this phenomenology in terms of dust geometry: intensely\nstar-forming galaxies at z~0 are typically interacting, and host dense\ncentrally-concentrated bursts of star formation and warm dust temperatures. At\nz~0.7, the bulk of intensely star-forming galaxies are relatively undisturbed\nspirals and irregulars, and we postulate that they have large amounts of\nwidespread lower-density star formation, yielding lower dust temperatures for a\ngiven IR luminosity.

{"text":"  We have used data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 5 to\nexplore the overall structure and substructure of the stellar halo of the Milky\nWay using about 4 million color-selected main sequence turn-off stars.

The density\nprofile of the stellar halo is approximately r^{-3}; it is possible that the\npower law slope is shallower inside 20kpc and steeper outside that radius. Yet,\nwe found that all smooth and symmetric models were very poor fits to the\ndistribution of stellar halo stars because the data exhibit a great deal of\nspatial substructure. We quantified deviations from a smooth oblate\/triaxial\nmodel using the RMS of the data around the model profile on scales >~100pc,\nafter accounting for the (known) contribution of Poisson uncertainties. The\nfractional RMS deviation of the actual stellar distribution from any smooth,\nparameterized halo model is >~40%: hence, the stellar halo is highly\nstructured. We compared the observations with simulations of galactic stellar\nhalos formed entirely from the accretion of satellites in a cosmological\ncontext by analysing the simulations in the same way as the data. While the\nmasses, overall profiles, and degree of substructure in the simulated stellar\nhalos show considerable scatter, the properties and degree of substructure in\nthe Milky Way's halo match well the properties of a `typical' stellar halo\nbuilt exclusively out of the debris from disrupted satellite galaxies.

{"text":"  A significant fraction of nearby elliptical galaxies are known to have high\ndensity gas disks in their circumnuclear (CN) region (0.1 to a few kpc).

To investigate the possible cause of the dearth of SF in these\nsystems, we study the gravitational stability of CN gas disks embedded within\nthe potentials of both the stellar bulge and the central massive black hole\n(BH) in ellipticals. We find that CN disks in higher mass galaxies are\ngenerally more stable than those in lower mass galaxies, because higher mass\ngalaxies tend to have more massive BHs and more centrally concentrated stellar\ndensity profiles. We also consider the case in which the central stellar\ndensity profile has a core, which is often observed for ellipticals whose total\nstellar mass is higher than about 10^11 Msun. Such a cored stellar density\nprofile leads to more unstable CN disks than the power-law density profile\ncharacteristic of less massive galaxies. However, the more massive BHs in\nhigh-mass galaxies act to stabilize the CN disk. Our results demonstrate that\nthe gravitational potentials of both the central BH and the stellar component\nshould be taken into account when studying the properties of CN disks, as their\nstability is sensitive to both the BH mass and the stellar density profile. Our\nresults could explain the observed trend that less luminous ellipticals have a\ngreater tendency to exhibit ongoing SF than giant ellipticals.\n"}
{"text":"  The evolution of the phase-space density profile in dark matter (DM) halos is\ninvestigated by means of constrained simulations, designed to control the\nmerging history of a given DM halo. Halos evolve through a series of quiescent\nphases of a slow accretion intermitted by violent events of major mergers. In\nthe quiescent phases the density of the halo closely follows the NFW profile\nand the phase-space density profile, Q(r), is given by the Taylor & Navarro\npower law, r^{-beta}, where beta ~ 1.9 and stays remarkably stable over the\nHubble time. Expressing the phase-space density by the NFW parameters, Q(r)=Qs\n(r\/Rs)^{-beta}, the evolution of Q is determined by Qs. We have found that the\neffective mass surface density within Rs, Sigma_s = rhos Rs, remains constant\nthroughout the evolution of a given DM halo along the main branch of its\nmerging tree. This invariance entails that Qs ~ Rs^{-5\/2} and Q(r) ~\nSigma_s^{-1\/2} Rs^{-5\/2} (r\/ Rs)^{-beta}. It follows that the phase-space\ndensity remains constant, in the sense of Qs=const., in the quiescent phases\nand it decreases as Rs^{-5\/2} in the violent ones. The physical origin of the\nNFW density profile and the phase-space density power law is still unknown.\nYet, the numerical experiments show that halos recover these relations after\nthe violent phases. The major mergers drive Rs to increase and Qs to decrease\ndiscontinuously while keeping Qs Rs^{5\/2} = const. The virial equilibrium in\nthe quiescent phases implies that a DM halos evolves along a sequence of NFW\nprofiles with constant energy per unit volume (i.e., pressure) within Rs.\n"}
{"text":"  Within a general theoretical framework we study the effective,\ndeformation-induced interaction between two colloidal particles trapped at a\nfluid interface in the regime of small deformations.

In mechanical isolation, i.e., if the net force\nacting on the total system consisting of the particles plus the interface\nvanishes, the superposition approximation is actually invalid.

{"text":"  We study a modified version of a model previously proposed by Jackson and\nWolinsky to account for communicating information and allocating goods in\nsocioeconomic networks.

In particular, if the residual blue spectrum is far\nabove the largest WMAP observed scale, the Slingshot primordial spectrum fits\nthe data well by only fixing its amplitude and spectral index at the pivot\nscale k_p=10^{-3}h x Mpc^{-1}.

Using only the fgas data for the 6 lowest redshift clusters at\nz<0.15, for which dark energy has a negligible effect on the measurements, we\nmeasure Omega_m=0.28+-0.06 (68% confidence, using standard priors on the Hubble\nConstant, H_0, and mean baryon density, Omega_bh^2). Analyzing the data for all\n42 clusters, employing only weak priors on H_0 and Omega_bh^2, we obtain a\nsimilar result on Omega_m and detect the effects of dark energy on the\ndistances to the clusters at ~99.99% confidence, with Omega_de=0.86+-0.21 for a\nnon-flat LCDM model. The detection of dark energy is comparable in significance\nto recent SNIa studies and represents strong, independent evidence for cosmic\nacceleration. Systematic scatter remains undetected in the fgas data, despite a\nweighted mean statistical scatter in the distance measurements of only ~5%. For\na flat cosmology with constant w, we measure Omega_m=0.28+-0.06 and\nw=-1.14+-0.31. Combining the fgas data with independent constraints from CMB\nand SNIa studies removes the need for priors on Omega_bh^2 and H_0 and leads to\ntighter constraints: Omega_m=0.253+-0.021 and w=-0.98+-0.07 for the same\nconstant-w model.

Our\nconclusion relies on the chiral nature of the valence quarks. The result\nimplies that for all sea quark methods which are in the same universality class\nas QCD, the numerical values of the physical coefficients in the various mixed\naction chiral Lagrangians will be the same up to lattice spacing dependent\ncorrections. This allows us to construct a prescription to determine the mixed\naction extrapolation formulae for a large class of hadronic correlation\nfunctions computed in partially quenched chiral perturbation theory at the\none-loop level.

This duality is shown to hold at\nthe level of N-point correlation functions on the sphere topology, and connects\ntree-level string amplitudes in the Euclidean version of the 2D black hole (x\ntime) to correlation functions in a non-linear sigma-model in flat space but in\npresence of a tachyon wall potential and a linear dilaton. The dual CFT\ncorresponds to the perturbed 2D quantum gravity coupled to c<1 matter (x time),\nwhere the operator that describes the tachyon-like potential can be seen as a\nn=2 momentum mode perturbation, while the usual sine-Liouville operator would\ncorrespond to the vortex sector n =1.

After briefly reviewing the computation of\ncorrelation functions in sine-Liouville CFT, we give a precise prescription for\ncomputing correlation functions in the twisted model. To show the new version\nof the correspondence we make use of a formula recently proven by S. Ribault\nand J.

To illustrate the power of the MCMC technique, we simulate three\nclusters of galaxies, each composed of a cluster-scale halo and a set of\nperturbing galaxy-scale subhalos. We ray-trace three light beams through each\nmodel to produce a catalogue of multiple images, and then use the MCMC sampler\nto recover the model parameters in the three different lensing configurations.\nWe find that, for typical Hubble Space Telescope (HST)-quality imaging data,\nthe total mass in the Einstein radius is recovered with ~1-5% error according\nto the considered lensing configuration. However, we find that the mass of the\ngalaxies is strongly degenerated with the cluster mass when no multiple images\nappear in the cluster centre. The mass of the galaxies is generally recovered\nwith a 20% error, largely due to the poorly constrained cut-off radius.\nFinally, we describe how to rank models quantitatively using the Bayesian\nevidence.

Ultimately, such\na method applied to strong lensing clusters with a very large number of\nmultiple images may provide unique geometrical constraints on cosmology.

Both galaxies reveal similar\nmorphologies of dust rings. They are, however, significantly different in the\ndust temperature: a cold (21 K) ring for NGC2841 and a warm (30 K) ring for\nNGC2976, which presumably reflects the difference in the origin of the ring\nstructure for the different Hubble type of the galaxy.

The chemical evolution of\nthese objects is consistent with the main chemical properties of the dSphs of\nthe Local Group.

The survey\nwas carried out in the L-band using adaptive optics assisted imaging with\nNAOS-CONICA (NACO) at the VLT. The chosen observation wavelength is well suited\nto search for close companions around young stars and delivers unprecedented\ndetection limits. The presented technique reaches some of the best\nsensitivities as of today and is currently the most sensitive method for the\ncontrast limited detection of substellar companions that are cooler than about\n1000K.

{"text":"  We investigate the transport properties of ballistic quantum wires in the\npresence of Zeeman spin splittings and a spatially inhomogeneous Rashba\ninteraction. The Zeeman interaction is extended along the wire and produces\ngaps in the energy spectrum which allow electron propagation only for spinors\nlying along a certain direction. For spins in the opposite direction the waves\nare evanescent far away from the Rashba region, which plays the role of the\nscattering center. The most interesting case occurs when the magnetic field is\nperpendicular to the Rashba field. Then, the spins of the asymptotic\nwavefunctions are not eigenfunctions of the Rashba Hamiltonian and the\nresulting coupling between spins in the Rashba region gives rise to sudden\nchanges of the transmission probability when the Fermi energy is swept along\nthe gap. After briefly examining the energy spectrum and eigenfunctions of a\nwire with extended Rashba coupling, we analyze the transmission through a\nregion of localized Rashba interaction, in which a double interface separates a\nregion of constant Rashba interaction from wire leads free from spin-orbit\ncoupling.

The Chebyshev polynomials are a useful tool in numerical methods\nas they display the fastest convergence of any of the orthogonal polynomials.\nIn this case they are also particularly useful as they eliminate one of the\nfeatures that plagues the post-Newtonian expansion.

{"text":"  We present a mathematical framework (referred to as Context-driven\nActualization of Potential, or CAP) for describing how entities change over\ntime under the influence of a context. The approach facilitates comparison of\nchange of state of entities studied in different disciplines. Processes are\nseen to differ according to the degree of nondeterminism, and the degree to\nwhich they are sensitive to, internalize, and depend upon a particular context.\nOur analysis suggests that the dynamical evolution of a quantum entity\ndescribed by the Schrodinger equation is not fundamentally different from\nchange provoked by a measurement often referred to as collapse, but a limiting\ncase, with only one way to collapse. The biological transition to coded\nreplication is seen as a means of preserving structure in the fact of\ncontext-driven change, and sextual replication as a means of increasing\npotentiality thus enhancing diversity through interaction with context. The\nframework sheds light on concepts like selection and fitness, reveals how\nexceptional Darwinian evolution is as a means of 'change of state', and\nclarifies in what sense culture, and the creative process underlying it, are\nDarwinian.\n"}
{"text":"  The binding neuron model is inspired by numerical simulation of\nHodgkin-Huxley-type point neuron, as well as by the leaky integrate-and-fire\nmodel. In the binding neuron, the trace of an input is remembered for a fixed\nperiod of time after which it disappears completely. This is in the contrast\nwith the above two models, where the postsynaptic potentials decay\nexponentially and can be forgotten only after triggering. The finiteness of\nmemory in the binding neuron allows one to construct fast recurrent networks\nfor computer modeling. Recently, the finiteness is utilized for exact\nmathematical description of the output stochastic process if the binding neuron\nis driven with the Poissonian input stream. In this paper, the simplest\nnetworking is considered for binding neuron. Namely, it is expected that every\noutput spike of single neuron is immediately fed into its input. For this\nconstruction, externally fed with Poissonian stream, the output stream is\ncharacterized in terms of interspike interval probability density distribution\nif the binding neuron has threshold 2. For higher thresholds, the distribution\nis calculated numerically. The distributions are compared with those found for\nbinding neuron without feedback, and for leaky integrator. Sample distributions\nfor leaky integrator with feedback are calculated numerically as well. It is\noncluded that even the simplest networking can radically alter spikng\nstatistics.

The high-resolution VLBI images of seven sources all show a\ncore-jet structure. We estimated the proper motions of three sources with the\nVLBI archive data, and find that the apparent speed increases with the distance\nof components to the core for all of them. In our BL Lacs sample, the Doppler\nfactor of LBLs is systematically larger than that of IBLs and HBLs.

While LBLs\nhave a smaller viewing angle than that of IBLs and HBLs, IBLs are comparable to\nHBLs.

{"text":"  We use a series of N-body\/smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations and\nanalytic arguments to show that the presence of an effective temperature floor\nin the interstellar medium at T_F ~ 10^4 K naturally explains the tendency for\nlow-mass galaxies to be more spheroidal, more gas rich, and less efficient in\nconverting baryons into stars than larger galaxies. The trend arises because\ngas pressure support becomes important compared to angular momentum support in\nsmall dark matter haloes. We suggest that dwarf galaxies with rotational\nvelocities ~ 40 km\/s do not originate as thin discs, but rather are born as\nthick, puffy systems. If accreted on to larger haloes, tenuous dwarfs of this\nkind will be more susceptible to gas loss or tidal transformation than\nscaled-down versions of larger spirals.

The shorter Moonshine\nmodule has the character q^(-47\/48)*(1+ 4371q^(3\/2)+ 96256q^2+ 1143745q^(5\/2)\n+...) and is the \"shorter cousin\" of the Moonshine module. Its lattice and code\nanalog are the shorter Leech lattice and shorter Golay code. We conjecture that\nthe shorter Moonshine module is the unique SVOA with this character.\n  The final chapter introduces the notion of extremal VOAs and SVOAs. These are\nself-dual (S)VOAs with character having the same first few coefficients as the\nvacuum representation of the Virasoro algebra of the same central charge. We\nshow that extremal VOAs exist at least for the central charges 8, 16, 24, 32,\n40 and that extremal SVOAs exist only for the central charges c=0.5, 1, ...,\n7.5, 8, 12, 14, 15, 15.5, 23.5 and 24. Examples for c=24 (resp. 23.5) are the\n(shorter) Moonshine module. Again, our results are similar to results known for\ncodes and lattices.\n"}
{"text":"  A dynamic cluster quantum Monte Carlo algorithm is used to study a spin\nsusceptibility representation of the pairing interaction for the\ntwo-dimensional Hubbard model with an on-site Coulomb interaction equal to the\nbandwidth for various doping levels.

{"text":"  On 27 October, 2003, two GOES M-class flares occurred in the lapse of three\nhours in active region NOAA 10486. The two flares were confined and their\nassociated brightenings appeared at the same location, displaying a very\nsimilar shape both at the chromospheric and coronal levels. We focus on the\nanalysis of magnetic field (SOHO\/MDI), chromospheric (HASTA, Kanzelhoehe Solar\nObservatory, TRACE) and coronal (TRACE) observations. By combining our data\nanalysis with a model of the coronal magnetic field, we compute the magnetic\nfield topology associated to the two M flares. We find that both events can be\nexplained in terms of a localized magnetic reconnection process occurring at a\ncoronal magnetic null point. This null point is also present at the same\nlocation one day later, on 28 October, 2003. Magnetic energy release at this\nnull point was proposed as the origin of a localized event that occurred\nindependently with a large X17 flare on 28 October, 2003, at 11:01 UT. The\nthree events, those on 27 October and the one on 28 October, are homologous.\nOur results show that coronal null points can be stable topological structures\nwhere energy release via magnetic reconnection can happen, as proposed by\nclassical magnetic reconnection models.\n"}
{"text":"  Control systems are usually modeled by differential equations describing how\nphysical phenomena can be influenced by certain control parameters or inputs.\nAlthough these models are very powerful when dealing with physical phenomena,\nthey are less suitable to describe software and hardware interfacing the\nphysical world. For this reason there is a growing interest in describing\ncontrol systems through symbolic models that are abstract descriptions of the\ncontinuous dynamics, where each \"symbol\" corresponds to an \"aggregate\" of\nstates in the continuous model. Since these symbolic models are of the same\nnature of the models used in computer science to describe software and\nhardware, they provide a unified language to study problems of control in which\nsoftware and hardware interact with the physical world. Furthermore the use of\nsymbolic models enables one to leverage techniques from supervisory control and\nalgorithms from game theory for controller synthesis purposes. In this paper we\nshow that every incrementally globally asymptotically stable nonlinear control\nsystem is approximately equivalent (bisimilar) to a symbolic model. The\napproximation error is a design parameter in the construction of the symbolic\nmodel and can be rendered as small as desired. Furthermore if the state space\nof the control system is bounded the obtained symbolic model is finite. For\ndigital control systems, and under the stronger assumption of incremental\ninput-to-state stability, symbolic models can be constructed through a suitable\nquantization of the inputs.\n"}

{"text":"  We study the exponential scale length of total radio emission, the spectral\nindex distribution, and the linear radio polarization in the Scd galaxy M33.\nObservations were carried out using the 3.6 cm dual channel and the 6.2 cm four\nchannel receivers of the 100--m Effelsberg telescope along with the L-band VLA\nD--array at 20 cm. High spatial resolution and sensitivity in both total and\nlinearly polarized radio continuum emission from M33 were achieved. We found\nconsiderable extended emission, not only from the main arms I S and I N, but\nalso from the weaker arms. The large--scale magnetic field exhibits\nwell--ordered spiral structure with almost the same orientation as that of the\noptical spiral arms, however, it does not show a clear structural correlation\nor anti--correlation with the optical arms. There is a north-south asymmetry in\npolarization that is frequency-dependent. We found that the ring mean spectral\nindex versus radius increases faster beyond $R$ = 4 kpc. At each wavelength,\nthe exponential scale length is larger inside than outside $R$ = 4 kpc. From\nthe larger scales lengths at $R$ $<$ 4 kpc, we conclude that star forming\nregions are mainly spread over the region $R$ $<$ 4 kpc without a dominant\nnuclear concentration. Furthermore, at $R$ $<$ 4 kpc, a spatial correlation\nbetween cosmic rays and star forming regions may exist. From the behaviour of\nthe mean spectral indices obtained from different pairs of the radio continuum\ndata at 3.6, 6.2, and 20 cm, we confirm that a decrease in the thermal fraction\ncauses an increase in the spectral index. The frequency-dependent asymmetry in\nthe polarization hints to an asymmetry in Faraday depolarization.\n"}
{"text":"  Based on a cosmological N-body simulation we analyze spatial and kinematic\nalignments of satellite halos within six times the virial radius of group size\nhost halos (Rvir). We measure three different types of spatial alignment: halo\nalignment between the orientation of the group central substructure (GCS) and\nthe distribution of its satellites, radial alignment between the orientation of\na satellite and the direction towards its GCS, and direct alignment between the\norientation of the GCS and that of its satellites. In analogy we use the\ndirections of satellite velocities and probe three further types of alignment:\nthe radial velocity alignment between the satellite velocity and connecting\nline between satellite and GCS, the halo velocity alignment between the\norientation of the GCS and satellite velocities and the auto velocity alignment\nbetween the satellites orientations and their velocities. We find that\nsatellites are preferentially located along the major axis of the GCS within at\nleast 6 Rvir (the range probed here). Furthermore, satellites preferentially\npoint towards the GCS. The most pronounced signal is detected on small scales\nbut a detectable signal extends out to 6 Rvir. The direct alignment signal is\nweaker, however a systematic trend is visible at distances < 2 Rvir. All\nvelocity alignments are highly significant on small scales. Our results suggest\nthat the halo alignment reflects the filamentary large scale structure which\nextends far beyond the virial radii of the groups. In contrast, the main\ncontribution to the radial alignment arises from the adjustment of the\nsatellite orientations in the group tidal field.

An\nadditional absorption edge at ~0.74 keV was also confirmed, which is presumably\ndue to the absorption by helium-like oxygen ions.

A general\nfeature of this hybrid model is a steep fall-off of the fusion cross section,\nsharp increase of logarithmic derivative L(E) with decreasing energy and the\nastrophysical S-factor showing a maxima at deep sub-barrier energies\nparticularly for near symmetric systems.

With these data and the cluster ages we assign both absolute age and\nfractional age (the fraction of the main sequence lifetime completed). For this\npurpose we have derived new bolometric corrections for Ap stars.\n  Magnetic fields are present at the surfaces of Ap stars from the ZAMS to the\nTAMS. Statistically for the stars with M > 3 M_o the fields decline with\nadvancing age approximately as expected from flux conservation together with\nincreased stellar radius, or perhaps even faster than this rate, on a time\nscale of about 3 10^7 yr. In contrast, lower mass stars show no compelling\nevidence for field decrease even on a timescale of several times 10^8 yr.\n  Study of magnetic cluster stars is now a powerful tool for obtaining\nconstraints on evolution of Ap stars through the main sequence. Enlarging the\nsample of known cluster magnetic stars, and obtaining more precise RMS fields,\nwill help to clarify the results obtained so far. Further field observations\nare in progress.\n"}
{"text":"  The electronic correlations on a C$_{20}$ molecule, as described by an\nextended Hubbard Hamiltonian with a nearest neighbor Coulomb interaction of\nstrength $V$, are studied using quantum Monte Carlo and exact diagonalization\nmethods.

Here we show that this is also the case for hole doping for $0<U\/t\\leq\n3$ and that, for both electron and hole doping, the effect of a non-zero $V$ is\nto work against pair-binding. We also study the magnetic properties of the\nneutral molecule, and find transitions between spin singlet and triplet ground\nstates for either fixed $U$ or $V$ values. In addition, spin, charge and\npairing correlation functions on C$_{20}$ are computed. The spin-spin and\ncharge-charge correlations are very short-range, although a weak enhancement in\nthe pairing correlation is observed for a distance equal to the molecular\ndiameter.\n"}

{"text":"  A recent analysis by Kadin has noted that the superconducting wavefunction\nwithin the BCS theory may be represented in real-space as a spherical\nelectronic orbital (on the scale of the coherence length) coupled to a\nstanding-wave lattice vibration. This lattice vibration, effectively a bound\nphonon, has wavevector 2kf and a near-resonant frequency (on the order of the\nDebye frequency) that maximizes the attractive electrostatic interaction energy\nwith the electronic orbital. The present paper extends this picture to a\ncoherent standing-wave pattern of electron and phonon waves that traverses the\nentire superconductor on the macroscopic scale. These parallel planes form a\ndiffractive waveguide for electron waves traveling parallel to the planes,\npermitting lossless supercurrent. A similar picture may be extended to\nunconventional superconductors such as the cuprates, with an array of standing\nspin waves rather than phonons. Such coherent lattice vibrations should be\nuniversal and distinctive indicators of the superconducting state, and should\nbe observable below Tc using standard x-ray and neutron diffraction techniques.\nFurther implications of this picture are discussed.\n"}

The size\ndistribution evolution is modeled from micron-sized grains to 50km-sized\nbodies. The model takes into account the crucial influence of radiation\npressure-affected small grains. We consider the collisional evolution of a\nfiducial a=120AU radius disc with an initial surface density in\n$\\Sigma(a)\\propto a^{\\alpha}$. We show that the system's radial extension plays\na crucial role: in most regions the collisional and size evolution of the dust\nis imposed by small particles on eccentric or unbound orbits produced further\ninside the disc. The spatial distribution of small grains strongly departs from\nthe initial profile, while the bigger objects, containing most of the system's\nmass, still follow the initial distribution. This has consequences on the\nscattered--light radial profiles which get significantly flatter, and we\npropose an empirical law to trace back the distribution of large unseen parent\nbodies from the observed profiles. We finally provide empirical formula for the\ncollisional size distribution and collision timescale that can be used for\nfuture debris disc modeling.\n"}
{"text":"  The difference in density profiles of the contributions from different\ndensity peaks to dark matter halos results in certain expectations about the\nMilky Way's stellar halo.

The former population are more centrally located at z=0,\nwhile stars forming in low mass late forming proto-galaxies are spread through\nthe halo. A difference in observed binding energy distinguishes these two\npopulations. We look at possible chemical abundance signatures of the two\npopulations. We also show that galaxies forming in isolated low sigma peaks\nwill form from primordial material. Thus, even though the oldest stars are\ncentrally concentrated as they originated in the early collapsing, densest\nregions, primordial stars would be found distributed throughout the halo. Thus,\nthe lack of observed metal free stars can be taken as directly constraining the\nPopulation III IMF, and the lowest metallicity observed stars can be\ninterpreted as holding clues to the chemical yields of Pop III stars.\n"}

The factorial growth experiments treated the Ni(II)\nconcentration in the agar gel and the diurnal light quanta (DLQ) as\nindependently variable parameters.

Nevertheless, we present a simple\nexample based on the Kuperstein embedding of D7-branes, z_1=constant, in which\nthe potential can be fine-tuned to be sufficiently flat for inflation. To\nderive this result, it is essential to incorporate the fact that the\ncompactification volume changes slightly as the D3-brane moves. We stress that\nthe compactification geometry dictates certain relationships among the\nparameters in the inflaton Lagrangian, and these microscopic constraints impose\nsevere restrictions on the space of possible models.

While, at\n10000 K, the bulky gas would absorb Lyman lines fully, at 50000K it emits\nsuperradiant lines. As superradiance de-excites the atoms strongly, nearly all\navailable energy is emitted in a few competing modes: Superradiance appears\nonly for beams which cross the largest column densities; for an observation\nfrom Earth, these beams generate three elliptical hollow cylinders whose bases\nare the observed rings; admitting that the Earth is not in a privileged\ndirection, these cylinders envelope ellipsoidal shells observed, for the\nexternal rings, by photon echoes. For the equatorial ring, the brightness of\nthe superradiant beams is multiplied by a quasi-resonant induced scattering of\nthe rays emitted by the star. The de-excitation of atoms by emitted beams cools\nthe gas strongly, so that ionization decreases fast, the process self\naccelerates. The energy of the high radiance rays from the star is strongly\nscattered to the ring while the low radiance of the glow which surrounds the\nstar is rather amplified. The fast absorption of the radial beams produces the\nradial decrease of radiance of the ring while a competition of modes produces\nthe pearls.\n"}

The study of these systems has attracted great\nattention during the last decades due to, on the one hand, the rich and complex\nunderlying physics, and on the other hand, their relevance for numerous\ntechnological applications in heterogeneous catalysis, corrosion and coating,\ndevelopment of microelectronic devices, etc. The review is focuses on recent\nadvances in the understanding of irreversible phase transitions (IPT's)\nproviding a survey of the theoretical development of the field during the last\ndecade, as well as a detailed discussion of relevant numerical simulations. The\nLangevin formulation for the treatment of second-order IPT's is discussed.\nDifferent Monte Carlo approaches are also presented in detail and the\nfinite-size scaling analysis of second-order IPT's is described. Special\nattention is devoted to the description of recent progress in the study of\nfirst-order IPT's observed upon catalytic oxidation of carbon monoxide and the\nreduction of nitrogen monoxide, using lattice gas reaction models. Only brief\ncomments are given on other reactions such as the oxidation of hydrogen,\nammonia synthesis, etc. Also, a discussion of relevant experiments is presented\nand measurement are compared with the numerical results. Furthermore, promising\nareas for further research and open questions are also addressed.\n"}
{"text":"  The embedder and the detector (or decoder) are the two most important\ncomponents of the digital watermarking systems. Thus in this work, we discuss\nhow to design a better embedder and detector (or decoder). I first give a\nsummary of the prospective applications of watermarking technology and major\nwatermarking schemes in the literature. My review on the literature closely\ncenters upon how the side information is exploited at both embedders and\ndetectors. In Chapter 3, I explore the optimum detector or decoder according to\na particular probability distribution of the host signals. We found that the\nperformance of both multiplicative and additive spread spectrum schemes depends\non the shape parameter of the host signals. For spread spectrum schemes, the\nperformance of the detector or the decoder is reduced by the host interference.\nThus I present a new host-interference rejection technique for the\nmultiplicative spread spectrum schemes. Its embedding rule is tailored to the\noptimum detection or decoding rule. Though the host interference rejection\nschemes enjoy a big performance gain over the traditional spread spectrum\nschemes, their drawbacks that it is difficult for them to be implemented with\nthe perceptual analysis to achieve the maximum allowable embedding level\ndiscourage their use in real scenarios. Thus, in the last chapters of this\nwork, I introduce a double-sided technique to tackle this drawback. It differs\nfrom the host interference rejection schemes in that it utilizes but does not\nreject the host interference at its embedder. The perceptual analysis can be\neasily implemented in our scheme to achieve the maximum allowable level of\nembedding strength.\n"}

{"text":"  To understand the formation of a magnetically dominated molecular cloud out\nof an atomic cloud, we follow the dynamical evolution of the cloud with a\ntime-dependent axisymmetric magnetohydrodynamic code. A thermally stable warm\natomic cloud is initially in static equilibrium with the surrounding hot\nionised gas. A shock propagating through the hot medium interacts with the\ncloud. As a fast-mode shock propagates through the cloud, the gas behind it\nbecomes thermally unstable. The $\\beta$ value of the gas also becomes much\nsmaller than the initial value of order unity. These conditions are ideal for\nmagnetohydrodynamic waves to produce high-density clumps embedded in a rarefied\nwarm medium. A slow-mode shock follows the fast-mode shock. Behind this shock a\ndense shell forms, which subsequently fragments. This is a primary region for\nthe formation of massive stars. Our simulations show that only weak and\nmoderate-strength shocks can form cold clouds which have properties typical of\ngiant molecular clouds.\n"}

The first two states have been studied at length over past\ncenturies, and last one finds its origin in the elementary fact that when\nsystem performance is pushed up, there exists a threshold above which\ninteraction between components overtake outside interaction.

{"text":"  The association of long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) with Type Ib\/c supernovae\nimplies that they explode into the winds of their Wolf-Rayet progenitor stars.\nAlthough the evolution of some GRB afterglows is consistent with expansion into\na free wind, there is also good evidence for expansion into a constant density\nmedium. The evidence includes the evolution of X-ray afterglows (when X-rays\nare below the cooling frequency), the evolution of the pre-jet break optical\nand X-ray afterglow, and the sharp turn-on observed for some afterglows. Recent\nobservations of short bursts, which are expected to be interacting with a\nconstant density medium, provide a check on the standard afterglow model.\nAlthough radio observations do not support the constant density model for long\nbursts in some cases, the evidence for constant density interaction is strong.\nThe most plausible way to produce such a medium around a massive star is to\nshock the progenitor wind. This requires a smaller termination shock than would\nbe expected, possibly due to a high pressure surroundings, a high progenitor\nvelocity, or the particular evolution leading to a GRB. However, the need for\nthe termination shock near the deceleration radius cannot be plausibly\naccomodated and may indicate that some long bursts have compact binary\nprogenitors and explode directly into the interstellar medium.\n"}
{"text":"  The existence of a singularity by definition implies a preferred scale--the\naffine parameter distance from\/to the singularity of a causal geodesic that is\nused to define it. However, this variable scale is also captured by the\nexpansion along the geodesic, and this can be used to obtain a regularized\nstate space picture by means of a conformal transformation that factors out the\nexpansion. This leads to the conformal `Hubble-normalized' orthonormal frame\napproach which allows one to translate methods and results concerning spatially\nhomogeneous models into the generic inhomogeneous context, which in turn\nenables one to derive the dynamical nature of generic cosmological\nsingularities.

{"text":"  The SEMATECH sponsored J-88-E project teaming Texas Instruments with\nNeuroDyne (et al.) focused on Fault Detection and Classification (FDC) on a Lam\n9600 aluminum plasma etch reactor, used in the process of semiconductor\nfabrication. Fault classification was accomplished by implementing a series of\nvirtual sensor models which used data from real sensors (Lam Station sensors,\nOptical Emission Spectroscopy, and RF Monitoring) to predict recipe setpoints\nand wafer state characteristics.

{"text":"  Star-formation within galaxies appears on multiple scales, from spiral\nstructure, to OB associations, to individual star clusters, and often\nsub-structure within these clusters. This multitude of scales calls for\nobjective methods to find and classify star-forming regions, regardless of\nspatial size. To this end, we present an analysis of star-forming groups in the\nlocal group spiral galaxy M33, based on a new implementation of the Minimum\nSpanning Tree (MST) method. Unlike previous studies which limited themselves to\na single spatial scale, we study star-forming structures from the effective\nresolution limit (~20pc) to kpc scales. We find evidence for a continuum of\nstar-forming group sizes, from pc to kpc scales. We do not find a\ncharacteristic scale for OB associations, unlike that found in previous\nstudies, and we suggest that the appearance of such a scale was caused by\nspatial resolution and selection effects. The luminosity function of the groups\nis found to be well represented by a power-law with an index, -2, similar to\nthat found for clusters and GMCs. Additionally, the groups follow a similar\nmass-radius relation as GMCs. The size distribution of the groups is best\ndescribed by a log-normal distribution and we show that within a hierarchical\ndistribution, if a scale is selected to find structure, the resulting size\ndistribution will have a log-normal distribution.

{"text":"  Galaxy cluster merger statistics are an important component in understanding\nthe formation of large-scale structure.

We investigate\nhow the halo merger rate can be statistically described by the halo mass\nfunction via the merger kernel (coagulation), finding an interesting\nenvironmental dependence of merging: halos within the mass resolution of our\nsimulations merge less efficiently in overdense environments. Specifically,\nhalo pairs with separations less than a few Mpc\/h are more likely to merge in\nunderdense environments; at larger separations, pairs are more likely to merge\nin overdense environments.\n"}
{"text":"  We combine Hubble Space Telescope images of a sample of 20 Seyfert galaxies\nat z=0.36 with spectroscopic information from the Keck Telescope to determine\nthe black hole mass - spheroid luminosity relation (M-L), the Fundamental Plane\n(FP) of the host galaxies and the M-sigma relation. Assuming pure luminosity\nevolution, we find that the host spheroids had smaller luminosity and stellar\nvelocity dispersion than today for a fixed M. The offsets correspond to Delta\nlog L_B,0=0.40+-0.11+-0.15 (Delta log M = 0.51+-0.14+-0.19) and Delta log sigma\n= 0.13+-0.03+-0.05 (Delta log M = 0.54+-0.12+-0.21), respectively for the M-L\nand M-sigma relation. A detailed analysis of known systematic errors and\nselection effects shows that they cannot account for the observed offset. The\ndata are inconsistent with pure luminosity evolution and the existence of\nuniversal and tight scaling relations. To obey the three local scaling\nrelations by z=0 the distant spheroids have to grow their stellar mass by\napproximately 60% (\\Delta log M_sph=0.20+-0.14) in the next 4 billion years.\nThe measured evolution can be expressed as M\/ M_sph ~ (1+z)^{1.5+-1.0}.

{"text":"  In the LCDM cosmology dark matter halos grow primarily through the accretion\nof smaller halos. Much of the mass in a halo of 10^14Msun comes in through\naccretion of ~10^13Msun halos. If each such halo hosted one luminous red galaxy\n(LRG) then the accretion of so many halos is at odds with the observed number\nof LRGs in clusters unless these accreted LRGs merge or disrupt on relatively\nshort timescales (~2Gyr). These timescales are consistent with classical\ndynamical friction arguments, and imply that 2-3 LRGs have merged or disrupted\nwithin each halo more massive than 10^14Msun by z=0. The total amount of\nstellar mass brought into these massive halos by z=0 is consistent with\nobservations once the intracluster light (ICL) is included. If disrupted LRGs\nbuild up the ICL, then the hierarchical growth of massive halos implies that a\nsubstantial amount of ICL should also surround satellite LRGs, as suggested by\nrecent observations of the Virgo cluster. Finally, we point out that these\nresults are entirely consistent with a non-evolving clustering strength and\nhalo occupation distribution, and note that observations of the latter in fact\nsupport the hypothesis that merging\/disruption of massive galaxies does indeed\ntake place at late times.\n"}

The first part of this paper provides a\nmodel-independent analysis for the relic density and direct detection in terms\nof four main parameters: the mass, the couplings to the Z, to the Z' and to the\nHiggs. These WIMP candidates arise naturally as Kaluza-Klein states in\nextra-dimensional models with extended electroweak gauge group SU(2)_L* SU(2)_R\n* U(1).

We find a large amount\nof substructure, which we interpret as the result of differential extinction\nacross the projected face of the cluster. With this interpretation, we are able\nto construct a spatially resolved extinction map across the cluster which is\nused to derive the intrinsic flux distribution. Fitting cluster profiles (King\nand EFF) to the intrinsic images we find that the cluster is 15-30% larger than\nprevious estimates, and that no strong evidence of mass segregation in this\ncluster exists. Using the optical spectra, we find that the age of M82F is\n60-80 Myr and from its velocity conclude that the cluster is not physically\nassociated with a large HII region that it is projected upon, both in agreement\nwith previous studies. The reconstructed integral field maps show that that\nmajority of the line emission comes from a nearby HII region.

The annealing temperature $T$ of the mixture then\nis a continuous parameter that characterizes the different sets of substrates,\nshaping the deposition process. As the alloy undergoes an order-disorder phase\ntransition at the Onsager critical temperature ($T_{c}$), the jamming and\npercolating properties of the dimers deposited over the substrate are subjected\nto non-trivial changes. These are reflected in a density-temperature phase\ndiagram with three well-defined regions. We find that for $T < T^* = 1.22\nT_{c}$ the occurrence of jamming prevents the onset of percolating clusters,\nwhile percolation is possible for $T > T^{*}$. Particular attention is focused\nclose to $T^{*}$, where the interplay between jamming and percolation restricts\nfluctuations, forcing exponents seemingly different from the standard\npercolation universality class.

{"text":"  We report results from numerical simulations of star formation in the early\nuniverse that focus on gas at very high densities and very low metallicities.\nWe argue that the gas in the central regions of protogalactic halos will\nfragment as long as it carries sufficient angular momentum.

This induces\nvigorous fragmentation, leading to a very densely-packed cluster of low-mass\nstars. This is the first stellar cluster. The mass function of stars peaks\nbelow 1 Msun, similar to what is found in the solar neighborhood, and\ncomparable to the masses of the very-low metallicity subgiant stars recently\ndiscovered in the halo of our Milky Way.

As fragmentation is\nless efficient, we expect stars with Z <= 10^-6 Zsun to be massive, with masses\nin excess of several tens of solar masses, consistent with the results from\nprevious studies.\n"}
{"text":"  We derive a perturbation expansion for general self-interacting random walks,\nwhere steps are made on the basis of the history of the path. Examples of\nmodels where this expansion applies are reinforced random walk, excited random\nwalk, the true (weakly) self-avoiding walk, loop-erased random walk, and\nannealed random walk in random environment.\n  In this paper we show that the expansion gives rise to useful formulae for\nthe speed and variance of the random walk, when these quantities are known to\nexist.

{"text":"  Fluids in which the interparticle potential has a hard core, is attractive at\nmoderate separations, and repulsive at greater separations are known to exhibit\nnovel phase behavior, including stable inhomogeneous phases. Here we report a\njoint simulation and theoretical study of such a fluid, focusing on the\nrelationship between the liquid-vapor transition line and any new phases. The\nphase diagram is studied as a function of the amplitude of the attraction for a\ncertain fixed amplitude of the long ranged repulsion. We find that the effect\nof the repulsion is to substitute the liquid-vapor critical point and a portion\nof the associated liquid-vapor transition line, by two first order transitions.\nOne of these transitions separates the vapor from a fluid of spherical\nliquidlike clusters; the other separates the liquid from a fluid of spherical\nvoids. At low temperature, the two transition lines intersect one another and a\nvapor-liquid transition line at a triple point. While most integral equation\ntheories are unable to describe the new phase transitions, the Percus Yevick\napproximation does succeed in capturing the vapor-cluster transition, as well\nas aspects of the structure of the cluster fluid, in reasonable agreement with\nthe simulation results.\n"}
{"text":"  A comparison of the 2MASS flux dipole to the CMB dipole can serve as a method\nto constrain a combination of the cosmological parameter Omega_m and the\nluminosity bias of the 2MASS survey. For this constraint to be as tight as\npossible, it is necessary to maximize the correlation between the two dipoles.\nThis can be achieved by optimizing the survey window through which the flux\ndipole is measured. Here we explicitly construct such a window for the 2MASS\nsurvey. The optimization in essence reduces to excluding from the calculation\nof the flux dipole galaxies brighter than some limiting magnitude K_min of the\nnear-infrared K_s band. This exclusion mitigates nonlinear effects and shot\nnoise from small scales, which decorrelate the 2MASS dipole from the CMB\ndipole. Under the assumption of negligible shot noise we find that the optimal\nvalue of K_min is about five. Inclusion of shot noise shifts the optimal K_min\nto larger values. We present an analytical formula for shot noise for the 2MASS\nflux dipole, to be used in follow-up work with 2MASS data.\n  The misalignment angle between the two dipoles is a sensitive measure of\ntheir correlation: the higher the correlation, the smaller the expectation\nvalue of the angle. A minimum of the misalignment is thus a sign of the optimal\ngravity window. We model analytically the distribution function for the\nmisalignment angle and show that the misalignment estimated by Maller et al. is\nconsistent with the assumed underlying model (though it is greater than the\nexpectation value). We predict with about 90% confidence that the misalignment\nwill decrease if 2MASS galaxies brighter than K_min = 5 mag are excluded from\nthe calculation of the flux dipole. This prediction has been indirectly\nconfirmed by the results of Erdogdu et al. (ABRIDGED)\n"}

Here we present an integrated experimental and\ntheoretical framework to understand and quantitatively predict how and when\ninformation spreads over social networks. Using data collected in Viral\nMarketing campaigns that reached over 31,000 individuals in eleven European\nmarkets, we show the large degree of variability of the participants' actions,\ndespite them being confronted with the common task of receiving and forwarding\nthe same piece of information. This have a profound effect on information\ndiffusion: Firstly, most of the transmission takes place due to super-spreading\nevents which would be considered extraordinary in population-average models.\nSecondly, due to the different way individuals schedule information\ntransmission we observe a slowing down of the spreading of information in\nsocial networks that happens in logarithmic time. Quantitative description of\nthe experiments is possible through an stochastic branching process which\ncorroborates the importance of heterogeneity. Since high variability of both\nthe intensity and frequency of human responses are found in many other\nactivities, our findings are pertinent to many other human driven diffusion\nprocesses like rumors, fads, innovations or news which has important\nconsequences for organizations management, communications, marketing or\nelectronic social communities.\n"}

Evidence for a nearby secondary galaxy\ndisturbing a nebula, as well as AGN and starburst driven outflows are presented\nas possible formation mechanisms. One nebula has a rotation velocity of the\nsame amplitude as the underlying molecular reservoir, which implies that the\nexcitation or formation of a nebula does not require any disturbance of the\nmolecular reservoir within the central galaxy. Bulk flows and velocity shears\nof a few hundred km\/s are seen across all nebulae.

Observations began with the XRT and UVOT\ntelescopes 286s after the initial trigger and continued for 1.2 x 10^6s. The\nX-ray lightcurve consists of three power-law segments: a rise until 420s,\nfollowed by a slow decay with alpha_2 = 0.63 +\/- 0.03 until 5000s, after which,\nthe lightcurve decays faster with a slope of alpha_3 = 1.59 +\/- 0.03. The\noptical lightcurve decays as a single power-law with alpha_O = 0.82 +\/- 0.03\nthroughout the observation. The X-ray data on their own are consistent with the\nbreak at 5000s being due to the end of energy injection. Modelling the optical\nto X-ray spectral energy distribution, we find that the optical afterglow can\nnot be produced by the same component as the X-ray emission at late times,\nruling out a single component afterglow. We therefore considered two-component\njet models and find that the X-ray and optical emission is best reproduced by a\nmodel in which both components are energy injected for the duration of the\nobserved afterglow and the X-ray break at 5000s is due to a jet break in the\nnarrow component. This bright, well-observed burst is likely a guide for\ninterpreting the surprising finding of Swift that bursts seldom display\nachromatic jet breaks.\n"}

{"text":"  Liesegang patterns emerge from precipitation processes and may be used to\nbuild bulk structures at submicron lengthscales. Thus they have significant\npotential for technological applications provided adequate methods of control\ncan be devised. Here we describe a simple, physically realizable\npattern-control based on the notion of driven precipitation, meaning that the\nphase-separation is governed by a guiding field such as, for example, a\ntemperature or a pH field. The phase-separation is modeled through a\nnon-autonomous Cahn-Hilliard equation whose spinodal is determined by the\nevolving guiding field. Control over the dynamics of the spinodal gives control\nover the velocity of the instability front which separates the stable and\nunstable regions of the system. Since the wavelength of the pattern is largely\ndetermined by this velocity, the distance between successive precipitation\nbands becomes controllable. We demonstrate the above ideas by numerical studies\nof a 1D system with diffusive guiding field. We find that the results can be\naccurately described by employing a linear stability analysis (pulled-front\ntheory) for determining the velocity -- local-wavelength relationship. From the\nperspective of the Liesegang theory, our results indicate that the so-called\nrevert patterns may be naturally generated by diffusive guiding fields.\n"}

{"text":"  We analyze the robustness of H--deficient post--AGB tracks regarding previous\nevolution of their progenitor stars and the constitutive physics of the\nremnants.

This work is thus complementary to our previous work (Miller\nBertolami & Althaus 2006) and intends to shed some light on the uncertainty\nbehind the evolutionary tracks presented there. We compute full evolutionary\nmodels for PG1159 stars taking into account different extramixing\n(overshooting) efficiencies and lifetimes on the TP-AGB during the progenitor\nevolution. We also assess the effect of possible differences in the opacities\nand equation of state by artificially changing them before the PG1159 stage.\nAlso comparisons are made with the few H-deficient post--AGB tracks available\nin the literature.

{"text":"  We consider the following problem of decentralized statistical inference:\ngiven i.i.d. samples from an unknown distribution, estimate an arbitrary\nquantile subject to limits on the number of bits exchanged. We analyze a\nstandard fusion-based architecture, in which each of $m$ sensors transmits a\nsingle bit to the fusion center, which in turn is permitted to send some number\n$k$ bits of feedback. Supposing that each of $\\nodenum$ sensors receives $n$\nobservations, the optimal centralized protocol yields mean-squared error\ndecaying as $\\order(1\/[n m])$. We develop and analyze the performance of\nvarious decentralized protocols in comparison to this centralized\ngold-standard. First, we describe a decentralized protocol based on $k =\n\\log(\\nodenum)$ bits of feedback that is strongly consistent, and achieves the\nsame asymptotic MSE as the centralized optimum. Second, we describe and analyze\na decentralized protocol based on only a single bit ($k=1$) of feedback. For\nstep sizes independent of $m$, it achieves an asymptotic MSE of order\n$\\order[1\/(n \\sqrt{m})]$, whereas for step sizes decaying as $1\/\\sqrt{m}$, it\nachieves the same $\\order(1\/[n m])$ decay in MSE as the centralized optimum.\nOur theoretical results are complemented by simulations, illustrating the\ntradeoffs between these different protocols.\n"}
{"text":"  Sequences that are defined by multisums of hypergeometric terms with compact\nsupport occur frequently in enumeration problems of combinatorics, algebraic\ngeometry and perturbative quantum field theory.

We propose a\nshortcut by constructing directly from the structure of the hypergeometric term\na finite set, for which we conjecture (and in some cases prove) that it\ncontains all the singularities of the generating series. Our construction of\nthis finite set is given by the solution set of a balanced system of polynomial\nequations of a rather special form, reminiscent of the Bethe ansatz. The finite\nset can also be identified with the set of critical values of a potential\nfunction, as well as with the evaluation of elements of an additive $K$-theory\ngroup by a regulator function.

{"text":"  Radial velocity surveys find Jupiter mass planets with semi-major axes a less\nthan 0.1 AU around ~1% of solar-type stars; counting planets with $a$ as large\nas 5 AU, the fraction of stars having planets reaches ~ 10% {Marcy,Butler}. An\nexamination of the distribution of semi-major axes shows that there is a clear\nexcess of planets with orbital periods around 3 or 4 days, corresponding to\na~0.03$ AU, with a sharp cutoff at shorter periods (see Figure 1). It is\nbelieved that Jupiter mass planets form at large distances from their parent\nstars; some fraction then migrate in to produce the short period objects. We\nargue that a significant fraction of the `hot Jupiters' (a<0.1 AU) may arise in\nbinary star systems in which the orbit of the binary is highly inclined to the\norbit of the planet. Mutual torques between the two orbits drive down the\nminimum separation or periapse r_p between the planet and its host star (the\nKozai mechanism). This periapse collapse is halted when tidal friction on the\nplanet circularizes the orbit faster than Kozai torque can excite it. The same\nfriction then circularizes the planet orbit, producing hot Jupiters with the\npeak of the semimajor axis distribution lying around 3 days. For the observed\ndistributions of binary separation, eccentricity and mass ratio, roughly 2.5%\nof planets with initial semimajor axis a_p ~ 5au will migrate to within 0.1au\nof their parent star.

{"text":"  Spectroscopic observations and theoretical models suggest resonant\nwave-particle interactions, involving high-frequency ion-cyclotron waves, as\nthe principal mechanism for heating and accelerating ions in the open coronal\nholes. However, the mechanism responsible for the generation of the\nion-cyclotron waves remains unclear. One possible scenario is that ion beams\noriginating from small-scale reconnection events can drive micro-instabilities\nthat constitute a possible source for the excitation of ion-cyclotron waves. In\norder to study ion beam-driven electromagnetic instabilities, the multi-fluid\nmodel in the low-beta coronal plasma is used. While neglecting the electron\ninertia this model allows one to take into account ion-cyclotron wave effects\nthat are absent from the one-fluid MHD model.

{"text":"  The addition of metals to any gas can significantly alter its evolution by\nincreasing the rate of radiative cooling. In star-forming environments,\nenhanced cooling can potentially lead to fragmentation and the formation of\nlow-mass stars, where metal-free gas-clouds have been shown not to fragment.\nAdding metal cooling to numerical simulations has traditionally required a\nchoice between speed and accuracy. We introduce a method that uses the\nsophisticated chemical network of the photoionization software, Cloudy, to\ninclude radiative cooling from a complete set of metals up to atomic number 30\n(Zn) that can be used with large-scale three-dimensional hydrodynamic\nsimulations. Our method is valid over an extremely large temperature range (10\nK < T < 10^8 K), up to hydrogen number densities of 10^12 cm^-3. At this\ndensity, a sphere of 1 Msun has a radius of roughly 40 AU. We implement our\nmethod in the adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) hydrodynamic\/N-body code, Enzo.\nUsing cooling rates generated with this method, we study the physical\nconditions that led to the transition from Population III to Population II star\nformation. While C, O, Fe, and Si have been previously shown to make the\nstrongest contribution to the cooling in low-metallicity gas, we find that up\nto 40% of the metal cooling comes from fine-structure emission by S, when solar\nabundance patterns are present. At metallicities, Z > 10^-4 Zsun, regions of\ndensity and temperature exist where gas is both thermally unstable and has a\ncooling time less than its dynamical time. We identify these doubly unstable\nregions as the most inducive to fragmentation. At high redshifts, the CMB\ninhibits efficient cooling at low temperatures and, thus, reduces the size of\nthe doubly unstable regions, making fragmentation more difficult.\n"}

{"text":"  We explore an accretion model for low luminosity AGN (LLAGN) that attributes\nthe low radiative output to a low mass accretion rate rather than a low\nradiative efficiency. In this model, electrons are assumed to drain energy from\nthe ions as a result of collisionless plasma microinstabilities. Consequently,\nthe accreting gas collapses to form a geometrically thin disk at small radii\nand is able to cool before reaching the black hole. The accretion disk is not a\nstandard disk, however, because the radial disk structure is modified by a\nmagnetic torque which drives a jet and which is primarily responsible for\nangular momentum transport. We also include relativistic effects. We apply this\nmodel to the well known LLAGN M87 and calculate the combined disk-jet\nsteady-state broadband spectrum. A comparison between predicted and observed\nspectra indicates that M87 may be a maximally spinning black hole accreting at\na rate of 10^{-3} solar masses per year.

A weak focused laser beam\nat 430 nm, carefully superimposed upon the ODT beam, selectively pumps the\n$^{3}$P$_{2}$-atoms inside the capture volume to the singlet state, where they\nare confined by the ODT. The triplet-MOT perpetually refills the capture volume\nwith $^{3}$P$_{2}$-atoms thus providing a continuous stream of cold atoms into\nthe ODT at a rate of $10^7 $s$^{-1}$.

If an affine hypersurface is given by a polynomial that is\nnon-degenerate with respect to its Newton polyhedron, then the motivic zeta\nfunction and thus the stringy E-function can be computed from this Newton\npolyhedron (by work of Artal, Cassou-Nogues, Luengo and Melle based on an\nalgorithm of Denef and Hoornaert).

{"text":"  Integrated light from distant galaxies is often compared to stellar\npopulation models via the equivalent widths of spectral features--spectral\nindices--whose strengths rely on the abundances of one or more elements.

{"text":"  Ultraviolet (UV) galaxies have been selected from GALEX. The presence of a\nFUV-dropout in their spectral energy distributions proved to be a very complete\n(83.3%) but not very efficient (21.4%) tool for identifying Lyman Break\nGalaxies (LBGs) at z~1. We divide the LBG sample into two sub-classes: red LBGs\n(RLBGs) detected at 24 micron which are mainly Luminous IR Galaxies (LIRGs) and\nblue LBGs (BLBGs) undetected at 24 microns down to 83 microJy. Two of the RLBGs\nare also detected at 70 micron. The median SED of the RLBGs is similar (above\nlambda~1 micron) to the dusty starburst HR10. However, unlike local (U)LIRGs,\nRLBGs are UV bright objects. We suggest that these objects contain a large\namount of dust but that some bare stellar populations are also directly\nvisible. The median SED of the BLBGs is consistent with their containing the\nsame stellar population as the RLBGs but with a lower dust content. The\nluminosity function of our LBG sample at z~1 is similar to the luminosity\nfunction of NUV-selected galaxies at the same redshift. The integrated\nluminosity densities of z~1 LBGs and NUV-selected galaxies are very consistent.\nWe show that star formation rates (SFRs) estimated from UV measurements and\ncorrected using the IRX-beta method provide average total SFR_TOT in agreement\nwith SFR_UV + SFR_dust. However, IRX-beta-based SFR_TOT shows a large\ndispersion. Summing up the detected UV (1150A rest-frame) and IR-based star\nformation rates of the detected objects, we find that only one third of the\ntotal (i.e. UV + dust) LBG SFR resides in BLBGs and two thirds in RLBGs, even\nthough most LBGs at z~1 are BLBGs. On the other hand, the total SFR of LBGs\naccounts for only 11% of the total SFR at z~1. Finally, we observe a regular\ndecrease of L_TIR \/ L_FUV from z=0 to z~2 for UV-selected samples.\n"}

The total CO line cooling emanating from this dense\nphase is found similar to that of the [CII] line at 158 micron, suggesting a\nvery different thermal balance to that seen in lower IR-luminosity galaxies,\nand one likely dominated by dense photon-dominated regions.

{"text":"  This is the second paper studying the QSOs in the spitzer QUEST sample.\nPreviously we presented new PAH measurements and argued that most of the\nobserved far infrared (FIR) radiation is due to star-forming activity. Here we\npresent spectral energy distributions (SEDs) by supplementing our data with\noptical, NIR and FIR observations. We define two sub-groups of ``weak FIR'' and\n``strong FIR'' QSOs, and a third group of FIR non-detections. Assuming a\nstarburst origin for the FIR, we obtain ``intrinsic'' AGN SEDs by subtracting a\nstarburst template from the mean SEDs. The resulting SEDs are remarkably\nsimilar for all groups. They show three distinct peaks corresponding to two\nsilicate emission features and a 3mic bump that we interpret as the signature\nof the hottest AGN dust. They also display drops beyond 20mic that we interpret\nas the signature of the minimum temperature (about 200K) dust. This component\nmust be optically thin to explain the silicate emission and the slope of the\nlong wavelength continuum. We discuss the merits of an alternative model where\nmost of the FIR emission is due to AGN heating. Such models are unlikely to\nexplain the properties of our QSOs but they cannot be ruled out for more\nluminous objects. We also find correlations between the luminosity at 5100A and\ntwo infrared starburst indicators: L(60mic) and L(PAH 7.7mic). The correlation\nof L(5100A) with L(60mic) can be used to measure the relative growth rates and\nlifetimes of the black hole and the new stars.\n"}
{"text":"  Surface magnetic properties of perovskite manganites have been a recurrent\ntopic during last years since they play a major role in the implementation of\nmagnetoelectronic devices. Magneto-optical techniques, such as X-ray magnetic\ncircular dichroism, turn out to be a very efficient tool to study surface\nmagnetism due to their sensitivity to magnetic and chemical variations across\nthe sample depth. Nevertheless, the application of the sum rules for the\ndetermination of the spin magnetic moment might lead to uncertainties as large\nas 40% in case of Mn ions. To overcome this problem we present an alternative\napproach consisting of using X-ray magnetic circular dichroism in reflection\ngeometry. Fit of the data by using a computer code based in a 4X4 matrix\nformalism leads to realistic results. In particular, we show that surface and\ninterface roughness are of major relevance for a proper description of the\nexperimental data and a correct interpretation of the results. By using such an\napproach we demonstrate the presence of a narrow surface region with strongly\ndepressed magnetic properties in La2\/3Ca1\/3MnO3 thin films.\n"}

{"text":"  Linear structural error-in-variables models with univariate observations are\nrevisited for studying modified least squares estimators of the slope and\nintercept. New marginal central limit theorems (CLT's) are established for\nthese estimators, assuming the existence of four moments for the measurement\nerrors and that the explanatory variables are in the domain of attraction of\nthe normal law. The latter condition for the explanatory variables is used the\nfirst time, and is so far the most general in this context. It is also optimal,\nor nearly optimal, for our CLT's. Moreover, due to the obtained CLT's being in\nStudentized and self-normalized forms to begin with, they are a priori nearly,\nor completely, data-based, and free of unknown parameters of the joint\ndistribution of the error and explanatory variables. Consequently, they lead to\na variety of readily available, or easily derivable, large-sample approximate\nconfidence intervals (CI's) for the slope and intercept. In contrast, in\nrelated CLT's in the literature so far, the variances of the limiting normal\ndistributions, in general, are complicated and depend on various, typically\nunknown, moments of the error and explanatory variables. Thus, the\ncorresponding CI's for the slope and intercept in the literature, unlike those\nof the present paper, are available only under some additional model\nassumptions.\n"}
{"text":"  The polarization sensitivity of the upcoming millimetric observatories will\nopen new possibilities for studying the properties of galaxy clusters and for\nusing them as powerful cosmological probes. For this reason it is necessary to\ninvestigate in detail the characteristics of the polarization signals produced\nby their highly ionized intra-cluster medium (ICM). This work is focussed on\nthe polarization effect induced by the ICM bulk motions, the so-called kpSZ\nsignal, which has an amplitude proportional to the optical depth and to the\nsquare of the tangential velocity. In particular we study how this polarization\nsignal is affected by the internal dynamics of galaxy clusters and what is its\ndependence on the physical modelling adopted to describe the baryonic\ncomponent. This is done by producing realistic kpSZ maps starting from the\noutputs of two different sets of high-resolution hydrodynamical N-body\nsimulations. The first set (17 objects) follows only non-radiative\nhydrodynamics, while for each of 9 objects of the second set we implement four\ndifferent kinds of physical processes. Our results shows that the kpSZ signal\nturns out to be a very sensitive probe of the dynamical status of galaxy\nclusters. We find that major merger events can amplify the signal up to one\norder of magnitude with respect to relaxed clusters, reaching amplitude up to\nabout 100 nuK. This result implies that the internal ICM dynamics must be taken\ninto account when evaluating this signal because simplicistic models, based on\nspherical rigid bodies, may provide wrong estimates. Finally we find that the\ndependence on the physical modelling of the baryonic component is relevant only\nin the very inner regions of clusters.\n"}

The lack of detection of radio emission from DRQNSs and the lack of point\nsources and pulsar wind nebulae in most of the observed SNRs can also be partly\nexplained by such a very rapid exponential decay.

In contrast to its fermionic counterpart the construction of the\nB-DMFT requires different scalings of the hopping amplitudes with Z depending\non whether the bosons are in their normal state or in the Bose-Einstein\ncondensate. A detailed discussion of how this conceptual problem can be\novercome by performing the scaling in the action rather than in the Hamiltonian\nitself is presented. The B-DMFT treats normal and condensed bosons on equal\nfooting and thus includes the effects caused by their dynamic coupling.

We confirm Ricotti's result\nthat, at virialization, the central log slopes alpha, at 5%-10% of the virial\nradius are correlated with the halo mass and that the halo concentration is a\nuniversal constant. Our results do not contradict the majority of published\npapers: when using a split power law to fit the density profiles, due to the\nalpha-concentration degeneracy, the fits are consistent with halos having a\nuniversal shape with alpha=1 or 1.5 and concentrations that depend on the mass,\nin agreement with results published elsewhere.\n  Recently, several groups have found no evidence for convergence of the inner\nhalo profile to a constant power law. The choice of a split power law\nparameterization used in this letter is motivated by the need to compare our\nresults to previous ones and is formally valid because we are not able to\nresolve regions where the slope of the fitting function reaches its asymptotic\nconstant value.

{"text":"  This paper presents a study of quasi-steady spherical accretion in the early\nUniverse, before the formation of the first stars and galaxies. The main\nmotivation is to derive the basic formulas that will be used in a companion\npaper to calculate the accretion luminosity of primordial black holes and their\neffect on the cosmic ionization history.\n  The following cosmological effects are investigated: the coupling of the gas\nto the CMB photon fluid (i.e., Compton drag), Hubble expansion, and the growth\nof the dark matter halo seeded by the gravitational potential of the central\npoint mass. The gas equations of motion are solved assuming either a polytropic\nor an isothermal equation of state. We consider the cases in which the\naccreting object is a point mass or a spherical dark matter halo with power-law\ndensity profile, as predicted by the theory of \"secondary infall''. Analytical\nsolutions for the sonic radius and fitting formulas for the accretion rate are\nprovided.\n  Different accretion regimes exist depending on the mass of the accreting\nobject. If the black hole mass is smaller than 50-100 Msun, gas accretion is\nunaffected by Compton drag. A point mass and an extended dark halo of equal\nmass accrete at the same rate if M>5000 Msun, while smaller mass dark halos\naccrete less efficiently than the equivalent point mass. For masses M>3 x 10^4\nMsun, the viscous term due to the Hubble expansion becomes important and the\nassumption of quasi-steady flow fails. Hence, the steady Bondi solutions\ntransition to the time-dependent self-similar solutions for \"cold cosmological\ninfall\".\n"}

Two\nmechanisms underlie these predictions: inverse Compton scattering and\nsynchrotron radiation, generally dominant at early and late times,\nrespectively. The former mechanism provides a unified description of the\ngamma-ray peaks, X-ray flares and even the optical `humps' seen in some\nfavourable cases; i.e. their very different durations, fluxes and peak-times\nare related precisely as predicted. The observed smooth or bumpy fast decay of\nthe X-ray light curve is correctly described case-by-case, in minute detail.\nThe `canonical' X-ray plateau, as well as the subsequent gradual steepening of\nthe afterglow to an asymptotic power-law decay, are as foretold.

{"text":"  We present optical spectroscopy of EX Hya during its 1991 outburst. This\noutburst is characterised by strong irradiation of the front face of the\nsecondary star by the white dwarf, an overflowing stream which is seen strongly\nin HeII and by a dip in the light curves, which extends from 0.1-0.6 in the\nbinary and spin phases. Strong irradiation of the accretion curtain and that of\nthe inner regions of the disc led to strong emission of HeII and to the\nsuppression of the Hg and Hb emission.\n  Disc overflow was observed in quiescence in earlier studies, where the\noverflow stream material was modulated at high velocities close to 1000 km\/s.\nIn outburst, the overflowing material is modulated at even higher velocities\n(~1500 km\/s). These are streaming velocities down the field lines close to the\nwhite dwarf. Evidence for material collecting near the outer edge of the disc\nand corotating with the accretion curtain was observed. In decline, this\nmaterial and the accretion curtain obscured almost all the emission near binary\nphase 0.4, causing a dip. The dip minimum nearly corresponds with spin pulse\nminimum. This has provided additional evidence for an extended accretion\ncurtain, and for the corotation of material with the accretion curtain at the\nouter edge of the disc. From these observations we suggest that a mechanism\nsimilar to that of Spruit & Taam, where outbursts result due to the storage and\nrelease of matter outside the magnetosphere, triggers the outbursts of EX Hya.\nThis is followed by the irradiation of the secondary star due to accretion\ninduced radiation.\n"}

{"text":"  During the epoch of reionization the 21cm signal is sensitive to the\nscattering rate of the ultraviolet photons, redshifting across the Lyman_alpha\nresonance.

After taking into account previously neglected natural\nbroadening of the resonance line, we find that photons approach the resonance\nfrequency and experience most scatterings at a significantly smaller distance\nfrom the source than naively expected r=(dnu\/nu_0)(c\/H), where dnu=nu-nu_0 is\nthe initial frequency offset, and the discrepancy increases as the initial\nfrequency offset decreases. As a consequence, the scattering rate P(r) drops\nmuch faster with increasing distance than the previously assumed 1\/r^2 profile.\nNear the source (r<1Mpc comoving), the scattering rate of photons that redshift\ninto the Ly_alpha resonance converges to P(r) \\propto r^{-7\/3}. The scattering\nrate of Ly_alpha photons produced by splitting of photons that redshift into a\nhigher resonance (Ly_gamma, Ly_delta, etc.) is only weakly affected by the\nradiative transfer, while the sum of scattering rates of Ly_alpha photons\nproduced from all higher resonances also converges to P(r) \\propto r^{-7\/3}\nnear the source. At 15<z<35, on scales of ~0.01-20Mpc\/h (comoving), the total\nscattering rate of Ly_alpha photons from all Lyman resonances is found to be\nhigher by a factor of ~1+0.3[(1+z)\/20]^{2\/3} than obtained without full\nradiative transfer.

We investigate the dust properties of these quasars finding an\nunusual dust extinction curve for one quasar and a high far-infrared luminosity\ndue to dust emission for another. The mean millimeter continuum flux for CFHQS\nquasars is substantially lower than that for SDSS quasars at the same redshift,\nlikely due to a correlation with quasar UV luminosity.

On contrary, fast movement of low-altitude satellites makes it possible\nto retrieve quasi-instantaneous profiles of plasma pressure along the satellite\ntrajectory, using the fluxes of precipitating particles. For this study, we\nused the Aureol-3 satellite data for plasma pressure estimation, and the IGRF,\nTsyganenko 2001 and Tsyganenko 2004 storm time geomagnetic field models for the\npressure mapping into the equatorial plane.

PBH in the vicinity of\nstars may be found in consequence of incorporation processes during the\nformation of stars from interstellar clouds. At present they can form the\ngravitationally captured haloes around stars like the family of solar comets.\nThe comet paradigm has been used to understand various aspects of PBH. Comet\ncollisions with the Sun and planets are ordinary events in solar system\nhistory. On the analogy, one can support the view that PBH collisions with the\nparent star may be quite frequent events in its history, too. PBHs are the\nengines driving gamma-ray bursts when collide with the stars. Entering a\nstellar atmosphere, PBH is supposed to produce the gamma-ray burst due to\naccretion with duration from a few tenths of second to a few seconds. It can\nexhibit the main qualitative features of some GRBs. Their masses are estimated\nin the range from thousandths to hundredths of the solar mass.

{"text":"  It is shown that the use of a density dependent effective Pauli potential\ntogether with a nucleon-nucleon interaction potential plays a crucial role to\nreproduce not only the binding energies but also the matter root mean square\nradii of medium mass range spin-isospin saturated nuclei.

{"text":"  We describe the derivation of the InterHourly Variability (IHV) index of\ngeomagnetic activity. The IHV-index for a geomagnetic element is mechanically\nderived from hourly values as the sum of the unsigned differences between\nadjacent hours over a seven-hour interval centered on local midnight. The index\nis derived separately for stations in both hemispheres within six longitude\nsectors using only local night hours. It is intended as a long-term index.\nAvailable data allows derivation of the index back well into the 19th century.\nOn a time scale of a 27-day Bartels rotation, IHV averages for stations with\ncorrected geomagnetic latitude less than 55 degrees are strongly correlated\nwith midlatitude range indices. Assuming a constant calibration of the aa-index\nwe find that observed yearly values of aa before the year 1957 are 2.9 nT too\nsmall compared to values calculated from IHV using the regression constants\nbased on 1980-2004. We interpret this discrepancy as an indication that the\ncalibration of the aa index is in error before 1957. There is no such problem\nwith the ap index. Rotation averages of IHV are also strongly correlated with\nsolar wind parameters (BV^2).

Lett. {\\bf 67}, 1626 (1991)]. The\ntime-dependent currents and their averages over succesive pumping periods are\ncomputed from the Keldysh formalism for tight-binding models. The calculation\nconsiders a sudden application of the pumping potentials at $t=0$ which leads\nto transient features of the time-dependent and averaged currents during the\nfirst pumping cycles which turn out to be important in the high-frequency\nregime. We show that in the transient regime the efficiency of the system as a\npump is rather poor because it mainly absorbs charge from both leads in order\nto fill the levels located below the bias window. Under a finite bias and a\nlow-frequency pumping signal the charge transferred across the system depends\non the number of levels located within the bias window. The internal charge\ndynamics and the role of energy sidebands are investigated. The so called\nsatellite peaks of the averaged current are observed also in the transient\nregime.\n"}

{"text":"  The ``trans-Planckian'' challenge in cosmology appears when we trace the\npresent physical wavelengths of fluctuations backwards in time.

Usually this issue is addressed in the inflationary\ncontext, but trans-Planckian reasoning is much broader. We examine this logic\nin a simple example of scalar quantum field theory in the expanding and\ncontracting Milne universes, where wavelengths of the eigenmodes are red- or\nblue-shifted. Trans-Planckian modifications of QFT should result in a\nUV-dependent VeV of the energy momentum tensor of a scalar field in the Milne\nuniverse. On the other hand, the Milne universe is another coordinate systems\nof flat Minkowski space-time, and the covariant energy momentum tensor should\nbe the same (but vacuum-dependent) in different coordinates of flat space time.\nWe explicitly demonstrate that in conventional QFT the energy momentum tensor,\nchoosing the adiabatic vacuum, is identical to zero in Minkowski coordinates,\nand remains zero in the contracting Milne universe (due to non-trivial\ncancellations of contributions from particles which appear in the accelerating\nframe and from vacuum polarization there). In contrast to this, the\ntrans-Planckian modification of the energy momentum tensor is not motivated. We\nprovide a similar argument for the expanding Milne universe, where the energy\nmomentum tensor in the conformal vacuum is non-zero. Similar arguments are\napplicable for other cosmological models where the curvature is much lower than\nPlanckian which leads to conflicts with trans-Planckian considerations.\n"}

{"text":"  We present a general computational scheme based on molecular dynamics (m.d.)\nsimulation for calculating the chemical potential of adsorbed molecules in\nthermal equilibrium on the surface of a material.

The scheme is valid at any coverage and temperature, so that in\nprinciple it allows the calculation of the chemical potential as a function of\ncoverage and temperature. It avoids all statistical mechanical approximations,\nexcept for the use of classical statistical mechanics for the nuclei, and\nassumes nothing in advance about the adsorption sites. From the chemical\npotential, the absolute desorption rate of the molecules can be computed,\nprovided the equilibration rate on the surface is faster than the desorption\nrate.

{"text":"  (Abridged) Mass-loss from massive stars leads to the formation of\ncircumstellar wind-blown bubbles surrounding the star, bordered by a dense\nshell. When the star ends its life in a supernova (SN) explosion, the resulting\nshock wave will interact with this modified medium. In a previous paper we\ndiscussed the basic parameters of this interaction. In this paper we go a step\nfurther and study the evolution of SNe in the wind blown bubble formed by a 35\n$\\msun$ star that starts off as an O star, goes through a red supergiant phase,\nand ends its life as a Wolf-Rayet star. We model the evolution of the CSM and\nthen the expansion of the SN shock wave within this medium. Our simulations\nclearly reveal fluctuations in density and pressure within the surrounding\nmedium. The SN shock interacting with these fluctuations, and then with the\ndense shell surrounding the wind-blown cavity, gives rise to a variety of\ntransmitted and reflected shocks in the wind bubble. The interactions between\nthese various shocks and discontinuities is examined, and its effects on the\nX-ray emission is noted. Our simulations reveal the presence of several\nhydrodynamic instabilities. They show that the turbulent interior, coupled with\nthe large fluctuations in density and pressure, gives rise to an extremely\ncorrugated SN shock wave. The shock shows considerable wrinkles as it impacts\nthe dense shell, and the impact occurs in a piecemeal fashion, with some parts\nof the shock wave interacting with the shell before the others. Therefore\ndifferent parts of the shell will `light-up' at different times. The\nnon-spherical nature of the interaction means that it will occur over a\nprolonged period of time, and the spherical symmetry of the initial shock wave\nis destroyed.\n"}

A comparison of the X-ray flux observed from\nthis source between 1980 and 2006 reveals that its absorbed 0.5-10 keV X-ray\nflux decreased from ~2x10^-12 ergs cm-2 s-1 to ~3x10^-13 ergs cm-2 during this\nperiod.

The X-ray properties of 1E\n1547.0-5408 suggest that this source is a magnetar - a young neutron star whose\nX-ray emission is powered by the decay of its extremely strong magnetic field.\nThe spatial coincidence between this source and G327.24-0.13 suggests that 1E\n1547.0-5408 is associated with a young supernova remnant, supporting a neutron\nstar interpretation.

Moreover, for systems with a continuous phase\ntransition, the minima of the individual EC-FORCs trace the equilibrium curve,\neven at very high scan rates.

{"text":"  Power-law distributions occur in many situations of scientific interest and\nhave significant consequences for our understanding of natural and man-made\nphenomena. Unfortunately, the detection and characterization of power laws is\ncomplicated by the large fluctuations that occur in the tail of the\ndistribution -- the part of the distribution representing large but rare events\n-- and by the difficulty of identifying the range over which power-law behavior\nholds. Commonly used methods for analyzing power-law data, such as\nleast-squares fitting, can produce substantially inaccurate estimates of\nparameters for power-law distributions, and even in cases where such methods\nreturn accurate answers they are still unsatisfactory because they give no\nindication of whether the data obey a power law at all.

{"text":"  It was suggested that the two consecutive metamagnetic transitions and the\nlarge residual resistivity discovered in Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ can be understood\nvia the nematic order and its domains in a single layer system.

To fill the gap in our understanding within the\nnematic order scenario, we investigate the effects of bilayer coupling and\nin-plane magnetic field on the electronic nematic phases in a bilayer system.\nWe propose that the in-plane magnetic field in the bilayer system modifies the\nenergetics of the domain formation, since it breaks the degeneracy of two\ndifferent nematic orientations. Thus the system reveals a pure nematic phase\nwith a resistivity anisotropy in the presence of an in-plane magnetic field. In\naddition to the nematic phase, the bilayer coupling opens a novel route to a\nhidden nematic phase that preserves the x-y symmetry of the Fermi surfaces.\n"}
{"text":"  Context: Ly-alpha-emitters have proven to be excellent probes of faint,\nstar-forming galaxies in the high redshift universe. However, although the\nsample of known emitters is increasingly growing, their nature (e.g. stellar\nmasses, ages, metallicities, star-formation rates) is still poorly constrained.\n  Aims: We aim to study the nature of Ly-alpha-emitters, to find the properties\nof a typical Ly-alpha-emitting galaxy and to compare these properties with the\nproperties of other galaxies at similar redshift, in particular Lyman-break\ngalaxies.\n  Methods: We have performed narrow-band imaging at the VLT, focused on\nLy-alpha at redshift z ~ 3.15, in the GOODS-S field. We have identified a\nsample of Ly-alpha-emitting candidates, and we have studied their Spectral\nEnergy Distributions (SEDs).\n  Results: We find that the emitters are best fit by an SED with low\nmetallicity (Z\/Z_sun = 0.005), low dust extinction (A_V ~ 0.32) and medium\nstellar masses of approximately 10^9 M_sun.

{"text":"  It is well known gravitational lensing, mainly via magnification bias,\nmodifies the observed galaxy\/quasar clustering. Such discussions have largely\nfocused on the 2D angular correlation. Here and in a companion paper (Paper II)\nwe explore how magnification bias distorts the 3D correlation function and\npower spectrum, as first considered by Matsubara. The interesting point is: the\ndistortion is anisotropic. Magnification bias preferentially enhances the\nobserved correlation in the line-of-sight (LOS) orientation, especially on\nlarge scales. For example at LOS separation of ~100 Mpc\/h, where the intrinsic\ngalaxy-galaxy correlation is rather weak, the observed correlation can be\nenhanced by lensing by a factor of a few, even at a modest redshift of z ~\n0.35. The opportunity: this lensing anisotropy is distinctive, making it\npossible to separately measure the galaxy-galaxy, galaxy-magnification and\nmagnification-magnification correlations, without measuring galaxy shapes. The\nanisotropy is distinguishable from the well known distortion due to peculiar\nmotions, as will be discussed in Paper II. The challenge: the magnification\ndistortion of the galaxy correlation must be accounted for in interpreting data\nas precision improves. For instance, the ~100 Mpc\/h baryon acoustic oscillation\nscale in the correlation function is shifted by up to ~3% in the LOS\norientation, and up to ~0.6% in the monopole, depending on the galaxy bias,\nredshift and number count slope. The corresponding shifts in the inferred\nHubble parameter and angular diameter distance, if ignored, could significantly\nbias measurements of the dark energy equation of state. Lastly, magnification\ndistortion offers a plausible explanation for the well known excess\ncorrelations seen in pencil beam surveys.\n"}

The error weighted average over\nACIS-S3, EPIC MOS 1 & 2 spectrometers for the maximum velocity difference is\n>3.3E03 km\/s at the 90% confidence level, similar to the velocity limits\nestimated indirectly for the \"bullet\" cluster (1E0657-56). The probability that\nthe velocity gradient is generated by standard random gain fluctuations with\nChandra and XMM is <0.1%. The regions of maximum velocity gradient are in CCD\nzones that have the lowest temporal gain variations. It is unlikely that the\nvelocity gradient is due to Hubble distance differences between projected\nclusters (probability<~0.01%). We mapped the distribution of elemental\nabundance ratios across the cluster and detected a strong chemical\ndiscontinuity using the abundance ratio of silicon to iron, equivalent to a\nvariation from 100% SN Ia iron mass fraction in the West-Northwest regions to\n32% in the Eastern region. The \"center\" of the cluster is located at the\nchemical discontinuity boundary, which is inconsistent with the radially\nsymmetric chemical gradient found in some regular clusters, but consistent with\na cluster merging scenario.

{"text":"  We present a systematic examination of the changes in semi-major axis caused\nby the mutual interactions of a group of massive bodies orbiting a central star\nin the presence of eccentricity dissipation. For parameters relevant to the\noligarchic stage of planet formation, dynamical friction keeps the typical\neccentricities small and prevents orbit crossing. Interactions at impact\nparameters greater than several Hill radii cause the protoplanets to repel each\nother; if the impact parameter is instead much less than the Hill radius, the\nprotoplanets shift slightly in semi-major axis but remain otherwise\nunperturbed. If the orbits of two or more protoplanets are separated by less\nthan a Hill radius, they are each pushed towards an equilibrium spacing between\ntheir neighbors and can exist as a stable co-orbital system. In the\nshear-dominated oligarchic phase of planet formation we show that the feeding\nzones contain several oligarchs instead of only one. Growth of the protoplanets\nin the oligarchic phase drives the disk to an equilibrium configuration that\ndepends on the mass ratio of protoplanets to planetesimals, $\\Sigma\/\\sigma$.\nEarly in the oligarchic phase, when $\\Sigma\/\\sigma$ is low, the spacing between\nrows of co-orbital oligarchs are about 5 Hill radii wide, rather than the 10\nHill radii cited in the literature. It is likely that at the end of oligarchy\nthe average number of co-orbital oligarchs is greater than unity. In the outer\nsolar system this raises the disk mass required to form the ice giants. In the\ninner solar system this lowers the mass of the final oligarchs and requires\nmore giant impacts than previously estimated. This result provides additional\nevidence that Mars is not an untouched leftover from the oligarchic phase, but\nmust be composed of several oligarchs assembled through giant impacts.\n"}

We show that the\nsoft excess is best described as originating from thermal Comptonization by\nplasma that is appreciably cooler than the primary X-ray emitting plasma; we\nfind that the form of the soft excess cannot be reproduced adequately by\nreflection from an ionized accretion disk. The only measurable deviation from\nthe power-law continuum in the hard spectrum comes from the presence of cold\nand ionized fluorescent iron-K emission lines at 6.4 and 6.97 keV,\nrespectively. While constraints on the ionized iron line are weak, the cold\nline is found to be narrow at CCD-resolution with a flux that does not track\nthe temporal changes in the underlying continuum, implying an origin in the\nouter radii of the accretion disk or the putative molecular torus of Seyfert\nunification schemes.

In the Earth, U and Th can combine with oxidative\nvolatile components and water, migrate up to the asthenosphere position to form\nan enrichment zone (EZ) of U and Th first, and then migrate up further to the\ncrusts through magmatism and metamorphism. We emphasize that the formation of\nan EZ of U, Th and other heat-producing elements is a prerequisite for the\nformation of a plate tectonic system.

{"text":"  With increasing applied current we show that the moving vortex lattice\nchanges its structure from a triangular one to a set of parallel vortex rows in\na pinning free superconductor. This effect originates from the change of the\nshape of the vortex core due to non-equilibrium effects (similar to the\nmechanism of vortex motion instability in the Larkin-Ovchinnikov theory). The\nmoving vortex creates a deficit of quasiparticles in front of its motion and an\nexcess of quasiparticles behind the core of the moving vortex. This results in\nthe appearance of a wake (region with suppressed order parameter) behind the\nvortex which attracts other vortices resulting in an effective\ndirection-dependent interaction between vortices. When the vortex velocity $v$\nreaches the critical value $v_c$ quasi-phase slip lines (lines with fast vortex\nmotion) appear which may coexist with slowly moving vortices between such\nlines. Our results are found within the framework of the time-dependent\nGinzburg-Landau equations and are strictly valid when the coherence length\n$\\xi(T)$ is larger or comparable with the decay length $L_{in}$ of the\nnon-equilibrium quasiparticle distribution function. We qualitatively explain\nexperiments on the instability of vortex flow at low magnetic fields when the\ndistance between vortices $a \\gg L_{in} \\gg \\xi (T)$.

We use Minkowski functionals and shapefinders to quantify the\nmorphology of superclusters: their sizes, shapes, and clumpiness. We generate\nempirical models of simple geometry to understand which morphologies correspond\nto the supercluster shapefinders. We show that rich superclusters have\nelongated, filamentary shapes with high-density clumps in their core regions.\nThe clumpiness of superclusters is determined using the fourth Minkowski\nfunctional $V_3$. In the $K_1$-$K_2$ shapefinder plane the morphology of\nsuperclusters is described by a curve which is characteristic to\nmulti-branching filaments.

We find that in high-density cores of rich\nsuperclusters there is an excess of early type, passive galaxies, among\ngalaxies in groups and clusters, as well as among those which do not belong to\ngroups, while in lower density outer regions there are more blue, star-forming\ngalaxies both in groups and among those galaxies which do not belong to groups.\nThis also shows that the galaxy content of groups depends on the environment\nwhere the groups reside in. The density distributions and the behaviour of the\nMinkowski functional V3 for different superclusters show that substructures in\nsuperclusters as traced by different populations of galaxies are very\ndifferent. Our results show that both local (group\/cluster) and global\n(supercluster) environments are important in forming galaxy morphologies and\nstar formation activity. The presence of a high density core with X-ray\nclusters and a relatively small fraction of star-forming galaxies in the\nsupercluster SCL126 may be an indication that this supercluster has started its\nevolution earlier than the supercluster SCL9.\n"}

Computer science research in evaluation faces an immense\nchallenge, having to cope with contributions from several conflicting and\ncontroversial research fields. We believe that deep changes must be made in our\nfield if we are to advance beyond the CBT (computer-based training) learning\nmodel and to build an adequate epistemology for this challenge. The first task\nis to relocate our field by building upon recent results from philosophy,\npsychology, social sciences, and engineering.

However,\nself-organizing principles have to be applied to deal with upcoming problems,\ne.g. information dissemination. These kinds of problems are not easy to tackle,\nrequiring complex algorithms. Moreover, the usefulness of pure ad-hoc networks\nis arguably limited. Hence, enthusiasm for mobile ad-hoc networks, which could\neliminate the need for any fixed infrastructure, has been damped. The goal is\nto overcome the limitations of pure ad-hoc networks by augmenting them with\ninstant Internet access, e.g. via integration of UMTS respectively GSM links.\nHowever, this raises multiple questions at the technical as well as the\norganizational level. Motivated by characteristics of small-world networks that\ndescribe an efficient network even without central or organized design, this\npaper proposes to combine mobile ad-hoc networks and infrastructured networks\nto form hybrid wireless networks. One main objective is to investigate how this\napproach can reduce the costs of a permanent backbone link and providing in the\nsame way the benefits of useful information from Internet connectivity or\nservice providers. For the purpose of bridging between the different types of\nnetworks, an adequate middleware service is the focus of our investigation.\nThis paper shows our first steps forward to this middleware by introducing the\nInjection Communication paradigm as principal concept.\n"}

We performed visible and near--infrared photometry and\nspectroscopy, as well as polarimetric observations. Polarimetric and\nspectroscopic data allowed us to classify 2004 VD17 as an E-type asteroid. A\ngood agreement was also found with the spectrum of the aubrite meteorite Mayo\nBelwa. On the basis of the polarimetric albedo (p_v=0.45) and of photometric\ndata, we estimated a diameter of about 320 m and a rotational period of about 2\nhours.

The aim of this\npaper is to identify and characterise the physical and kinematic properties of\nthe external star forming regions in a sample of ULIRGs, including TDG\ncandidates, using optical IFS and high angular resolution HST imaging. We have\nfound that the presence of external star-forming regions is common with 12\nobjects being identified in 5 ULIRGs.

In\naddition, the line ratios, metallicities and H\\alpha equivalent widths are\ntypical of young bursts of star formation (age ~ 5-8 Myr), and similar to those\nof other TDG candidates. Their extinction corrected H\\alpha luminosities lead\nto masses for the young stellar component of ~2x10^6 - 7x10^8 M_sun. The\nlikelihood of survival of these regions as TDGs is discussed based on their\nstructural and kinematic properties.

Predictions for a cluster population without dissolution limited by a\nV-band detection result in a power-law dN\/dt distribution with an index of\n~-0.7.

When a mass cut well above the limiting cluster mass is applied, the\ndN\/dt distribution is flat up to 1 Gyr. We conclude that cluster dissolution is\nof small importance in shaping the dN\/dt distribution and incompleteness causes\ndN\/dt to decline. The reason that no (mass independent) infant mortality of\nstar clusters in the first ~10-20 Myr is found is explained by a detection bias\ntowards clusters without nebular emission, i.e. cluster that have survived the\ninfant mortality phase. The reason we find no evidence for tidal (mass\ndependent) cluster dissolution in the first Gyr is explained by the weak tidal\nfield of the SMC. Our results are in sharp contrast to the interpretation of\nChandar et al. (2006), who interpret the declining dN\/dt distribution as rapid\ncluster dissolution. This is due to their erroneous assumption that the sample\nis limited by cluster mass, rather than luminosity.\n"}
{"text":"  Using high-resolution UV spectra of 16 low-z QSOs, we study the physical\nconditions and statistics of O VI absorption in the IGM at z < 0.5.

For intervening systems [components] with rest-frame equivalent\nwidth W_{r} > 30 mA, the number of O VI absorbers per unit redshift dN\/dz =\n15.6(+2.9\/-2.4) [21.0(+3.2\/-2.8)], and this decreases to dN\/dz = 0.9(+1.0\/-0.5)\n[0.3(+0.7\/-0.3)] for W_{r} > 300 mA. The number per redshift increases steeply\nas z_{abs} approaches z_{QSO}, and some proximate absorbers have substantially\nlower H I\/O VI ratios. The lower proximate ratios could be partially due to\nionization effects but also require higher metallicities. We find that 37% of\nthe intervening O VI absorbers have velocity centroids that are well-aligned\nwith corresponding H I absorption. If the O VI and the H I trace the same gas,\nthe relatively small differences in line widths imply the absorbers are cool\nwith T < 10^{5} K.

However, the O VI in the\napparently simple and cold systems could be associated with a hot phase with T\n~ 10^{5.5} K if the metallicity is high enough to cause the associated broad Ly\nalpha absorption to be too weak to detect.

{"text":"  We present the discovery of a 40 kpc H-alpha tail and at least 29\nemission-line objects downstream of a star-forming galaxy ESO 137-001 in the\nrich, nearby cluster A3627. The galaxy is known to possess a dramatic 70 kpc\nX-ray tail. The detected H-alpha tail coincides positionally with the X-ray\ntail. The H-alpha emission in the galaxy is sharply truncated on the front and\nthe sides near the nucleus, indicating significant ram pressure stripping. ESO\n137-001 is thus the first cluster late-type galaxy known unambiguously with\nboth an X-ray tail and an H-alpha tail. The emission-line objects are all\ndistributed downstream of the galaxy, with projected distance up to 39 kpc from\nthe galaxy. From the analysis on the H-alpha_{off} frame and the estimate of\nthe background emission-line objects, we conclude that it is very likely all 29\nemission-line objects are HII regions in A3627. The high surface number density\nand luminosities of these HII regions (up to 10^40 ergs\/s) dwarf the previously\nknown examples of isolated HII regions in clusters. We suggest that star\nformation may proceed in the stripped ISM, in both the galactic halo and\nintracluster space. The total mass of formed stars in the stripped ISM of ESO\n137-001 may approach several times 10^7 solar masses. Therefore, stripping of\nthe ISM not only contributes to the ICM, but also adds to the intracluster\nstellar light through subsequent star formation. The data also imply that ESO\n137-001 is in an active stage of transformation, accompanied by the build-up of\na central bulge and depletion of the ISM.\n"}

We investigate the hypothesis that the\nphotoionization of these highly metallic droplets can explain the observed\n``abundance discrepancy factors'' (ADFs), which are found when comparing\nabundances derived from recombination lines and from collisionally excited\nlines, both in Galactic and extragalactic HII regions. We derive bounds of\n10^{13}--10^{15} cm on the droplet sizes inside HII regions in order that (1)\nthey should not have already been detected by direct imaging of nearby nebulae,\nand (2) they should not be too swiftly destroyed by diffusion in the ionized\ngas. From photoionization modelling we find that, if this inhomogeneous\nenrichment scenario holds, then the recombination lines strongly overestimate\nthe metallicities of the fully mixed HII regions. The abundances derived from\ncollisionally excited lines also suffer some bias, although to a much lesser\nextent. In the absence of any recipe for correcting these biases, we recommend\nthe discarding of all objects showing large ADFs from studies of galactic\nchemical evolution.

{"text":"  How do T Tauri disks accrete? The magneto-rotational instability (MRI)\nsupplies one means, but protoplanetary disk gas is typically too poorly ionized\nto be magnetically active. Here we show that the MRI can, in fact, explain\nobserved accretion rates for the sub-class of T Tauri disks known as\ntransitional systems. Transitional disks are swept clean of dust inside rim\nradii of ~10 AU. Stellar coronal X-rays ionize material in the disk rim,\nactivating the MRI there. Gas flows from the rim to the star, at a rate limited\nby the depth to which X-rays ionize the rim wall. The wider the rim, the larger\nthe surface area that the rim wall exposes to X-rays, and the greater the\naccretion rate. Interior to the rim, the MRI continues to transport gas; the\nMRI is sustained even at the disk midplane by super-keV X-rays that Compton\nscatter down from the disk surface. Accretion is therefore steady inside the\nrim. Blown out by radiation pressure, dust largely fails to accrete with gas.\nContrary to what is usually assumed, ambipolar diffusion, not Ohmic\ndissipation, limits how much gas is MRI-active. We infer values for the\ntransport parameter alpha on the order of 0.01 for GM Aur, TW Hyd, and DM Tau.\nBecause the MRI can only afflict a finite radial column of gas at the rim, disk\nproperties inside the rim are insensitive to those outside. Thus our picture\nprovides one robust setting for planet-disk interaction: a protoplanet interior\nto the rim will interact with gas whose density, temperature, and transport\nproperties are definite and decoupled from uncertain initial conditions. Our\nstudy also supplies half the answer to how disks dissipate: the inner disk\ndrains from the inside out by the MRI, while the outer disk photoevaporates by\nstellar ultraviolet radiation.\n"}

{"text":"  The first challenge in the formation of both terrestrial planets and the\ncores of gas giants is the retention of grains in protoplanetary disks. In most\nregions of these disks, gas attains sub-Keplerian speeds as a consequence of a\nnegative pressure gradient. Hydrodynamic drag leads to orbital decay and\ndepletion of the solid material in the disk, with characteristic timescales as\nshort as only a few hundred years for meter-sized objects at 1 AU. In this\npaper, we suggest a particle retention mechanism which promotes the\naccumulation of grains and the formation of planetesimals near the water\nsublimation front or ``snow line.'' This model is based on the assumption that,\nin the regions most interesting for planet formation, the viscous evolution of\nthe disk is due to turbulence driven by the magneto-rotational instability\n(MRI) in the surface layers of the disk. The depth to which MRI effectively\ngenerates turbulence is a strong function of the grain size and abundance. A\nsharp increase in the grain-to-gas density ratio across the snow line reduces\nthe column depth of the active layer. As the disk evolves towards a\nquasi-steady-state, this change in the active layer creates a local maximum in\nradial distribution of the gas surface density and pressure, causing the gas to\nrotate at super-Keplerian speed and halting the inward migration of grains.\nThis senario presents a robust process for grain retention which may aid in the\nformation of proto-gas-giant cores preferentially near the snow line.\n"}

We also present observations of the host galaxy.\nThe observed optical emission was likely related to the large flare observed in\nthe X-ray light curve. The apparent steep decay was therefore not due to the\njet effect. Available data are indeed consistent with low collimation, in turn\nimplying a large energy release, comparable to that of long GRBs. The flare\nproperties also constrain the internal shock mechanism, requiring a large\nLorentz factor contrast between the colliding shells. This implies that the\ncentral engine was active at late times, rather than ejecting all shells\nsimultaneously.

We focus on one of the PN approximants that has\nbeen proposed for use in gravitational-wave data analysis, the restricted 3.5PN\n``TaylorT1'' waveforms, and compare these with a section of the numerical\nwaveform from the second to the eighth orbit, which is about one and a half\norbits before merger.

{"text":"  Cortical neurons are subject to sustained and irregular synaptic activity\nwhich causes important fluctuations of the membrane potential (Vm).

The simplified, fluctuating point-conductance model of synaptic\nactivity provides the starting point of a variety of methods for the analysis\nof intracellular Vm recordings. In this model, the synaptic excitatory and\ninhibitory conductances are described by Gaussian-distributed stochastic\nvariables, or colored conductance noise. The matching of experimentally\nrecorded Vm distributions to an invertible theoretical expression derived from\nthe model allows the extraction of parameters characterizing the synaptic\nconductance distributions. This analysis can be complemented by the matching of\nexperimental Vm power spectral densities (PSDs) to a theoretical template, even\nthough the unexpected scaling properties of experimental PSDs limit the\nprecision of this latter approach. Building on this stochastic characterization\nof synaptic activity, we also propose methods to qualitatively and\nquantitatively evaluate spike-triggered averages of synaptic time-courses\npreceding spikes.

{"text":"  We study numerically finite-size corrections in scaling relations for\nroughness distributions of various interface growth models. The most common\nrelation, which considers the average roughness $<w_2>$ as scaling factor, is\nnot obeyed in the steady states of a group of ballistic-like models in 2+1\ndimensions, even when very large system sizes are considered. On the other\nhand, good collapse of the same data is obtained with a scaling relation that\ninvolves the root mean square fluctuation of the roughness, which can be\nexplained by finite-size effects on second moments of the scaling functions. We\nalso obtain data collapse with an alternative scaling relation that accounts\nfor the effect of the intrinsic width, which is a constant correction term\npreviously proposed for the scaling of $<w_2>$. This illustrates how\nfinite-size corrections can be obtained from roughness distributions scaling.\nHowever, we discard the usual interpretation that the intrinsic width is a\nconsequence of high surface steps by analyzing data of restricted\nsolid-on-solid models with various maximal height differences between\nneighboring columns. We also observe that large finite-size corrections in the\nroughness distributions are usually accompanied by huge corrections in height\ndistributions and average local slopes, as well as in estimates of scaling\nexponents. The molecular-beam epitaxy model of Das Sarma and Tamborenea in 1+1\ndimensions is a case example in which none of the proposed scaling relations\nworks properly, while the other measured quantities do not converge to the\nexpected asymptotic values.

{"text":"  LS I +61 303 is a puzzling Be\/X-ray binary with variable gamma-ray emission\nat up TeV energies. The nature of the compact object and the origin of the\nhigh-energy emission are unclear. One family of models invokes particle\nacceleration in shocks from the collision between the B-star wind and a\nrelativistic pulsar wind, while another centers on a relativistic jet powered\nby accretion. Recent high-resolution radio observations showing a putative\n\"cometary tail\" pointing away from the Be star near periastron have been cited\nas support for the pulsar-wind model. We wish here to carry out a quantitative\nassessment of these competing models for this extraordinary source. We apply a\n3D SPH code for dynamical simulations of both the pulsar-wind-interaction and\naccretion-jet models. The former yields a description of the shape of the\nwind-wind interaction surface. The latter provides an estimation of the\naccretion rate. The results allow critical evaluation of how the two distinct\nmodels confront the data in various wavebands under a range of conditions. When\none accounts for the 3D dynamical wind interaction under realistic constraints\nfor the relative strength of the B-star and pulsar winds, the resulting form of\nthe interaction front does not match the putative \"cometary tail\" claimed from\nradio observations. On the other hand, dynamical simulations of the\naccretion-jet model indicate that the orbital phase variation of accretion\npower includes a secondary broad peak well away from periastron, thus providing\na plausible way to explain the observed TeV gamma ray emission toward apastron.\nWe conclude that the colliding-wind model is not clearly established for LS I\n+61 303, while the accretion-jet model can reproduce many key characteristics\nof the observed TeV gamma-ray emission.\n"}

The\ncriteria used in many previous studies instead select predominantly group\nmembers. We refine a set of selection criteria for which the group\ncontamination is estimated to be less than 7% and present a catalogue of the\nresulting sample. The angular distribution of satellites about their host is\nbiased towards the major axes for spheroidal galaxies and probably also for red\ndisc galaxies, but is isotropic for blue disc galaxies, i.e. it is the colour\nof the host that determines the distribution of its satellites rather than its\nmorphology.

Over the RF frequency\nrange of 205-240 GHz, the single-sideband receiver noise temperatures of the\nnew mixer are 40-100 K for the 4.0-8.0 GHz IF frequency band. The image\nrejection ratios are greater than 10 dB over the same range. For the dual IF\nsignals obtained by the receiver, we have developed two sets of acousto-optical\nspectrometers and a telescope control system. Using the new telescope system,\nwe successfully detected the 12CO (J=2-1) and 13CO (J=2-1) emission lines\nsimultaneously toward Orion KL in 2005 March. Using the waveguide-type\nsideband-separating SIS mixer for the 200 GHz band, we have initiated the first\nsimultaneous 12CO (J=2-1) and 13CO (J=2-1) survey of the galactic plane as well\nas large-scale mapping observations of nearby molecular clouds.\n"}
{"text":"  Water is necessary both for the evolution of life and its continuance. It\npossesses particular properties that cannot be found in other materials and\nthat are required for life-giving processes. These properties are brought about\nby the hydrogen bonded environment particularly evident in liquid water. Each\nliquid water molecule is involved in about four hydrogen bonds with strengths\nconsiderably less than covalent bonds but considerably greater than the natural\nthermal energy. These hydrogen bonds are roughly tetrahedrally arranged such\nthat when strongly formed the local clustering expands, decreasing the density.\nSuch low density structuring naturally occurs at low and supercooled\ntemperatures and gives rise to many physical and chemical properties that\nevidence the particular uniqueness of liquid water. If aqueous hydrogen bonds\nwere actually somewhat stronger then water would behave similar to a glass,\nwhereas if they were weaker then water would be a gas and only exist as a\nliquid at sub-zero temperatures. The overall conclusion of this investigation\nis that water's hydrogen bond strength is poised centrally within a narrow\nwindow of its suitability for life.\n"}
{"text":"  We extend the definition of the Costas property to functions in the\ncontinuum, namely on intervals of the reals or the rationals, and argue that\nsuch functions can be used in the same applications as discrete Costas arrays.\nWe construct Costas bijections in the real continuum within the class of\npiecewise continuously differentiable functions, but our attempts to construct\na fractal-like Costas bijection there are successful only under slight but\nnecessary deviations from the usual arithmetic laws. Furthermore, we are able,\ncontingent on the validity of Artin's conjecture, to set up a limiting process\naccording to which sequences of Welch Costas arrays converge to smooth Costas\nbijections over the reals. The situation over the rationals is different:\nthere, we propose an algorithm of great generality and flexibility for the\nconstruction of a Costas fractal bijection. Its success, though, relies heavily\non the enumerability of the rationals, and therefore it cannot be generalized\nover the reals in an obvious way.\n"}
{"text":"  We examine the relationship between little Higgs and 5d composite models with\nidentical symmetry structures. By performing an \"extreme\" deconstruction, one\ncan reduce any warped composite model to a little Higgs theory on a handful of\nsites. This allows us to use 4d intuition and the powerful constraints of\nnonlinear sigma models to elucidate obscure points in the original setup. We\nfind that the finiteness of the Higgs potential in 5d is due to the same\ncollective symmetry breaking as in the little Higgs. We compare a 4d and a 5d\nmodel with the same symmetry to the data. Reviewing the constraints on models\nrelated to the Minimal Composite Higgs (hep-ph\/0412089), we see that it has\ndifficulty in producing acceptable values for S, T, and m_{top} simultaneously.\nBy contrast, in a global analysis, the Minimal Moose with custodial symmetry is\nviable in a large region of its parameter space and suffers from no numeric\ntunings. We conjecture that this result is generic for 4d and 5d models with\nidentical symmetries. The data will less strongly constrain the little theory.\n"}
{"text":"  We obtain the phase diagram and thermodynamic behavior of the Kondo necklace\nmodel for arbitrary dimensions $d$ using a representation for the localized and\nconduction electrons in terms of local Kondo singlet and triplet operators. A\ndecoupling scheme on the double time Green's functions yields the dispersion\nrelation for the excitations of the system. We show that in $d\\geq 3$ there is\nan antiferromagnetically ordered state at finite temperatures terminating at a\nquantum critical point (QCP). In 2-d, long range magnetic order occurs only at\nT=0. The line of Neel transitions for $d>2$ varies with the distance to the\nquantum critical point QCP $|g|$ as, $T_N \\propto |g|^{\\psi}$ where the shift\nexponent $\\psi=1\/(d-1)$. In the paramagnetic side of the phase diagram, the\nspin gap behaves as $\\Delta\\approx \\sqrt{|g|}$ for $d \\ge 3$ consistent with\nthe value $z=1$ found for the dynamical critical exponent. We also find in this\nregion a power law temperature dependence in the specific heat for\n$k_BT\\gg\\Delta$ and along the non-Fermi liquid trajectory. For $k_BT\n\\ll\\Delta$, in the so-called Kondo spin liquid phase, the thermodynamic\nbehavior is dominated by an exponential temperature dependence.\n"}
{"text":"  Simulations of liquid-gas systems with extended interfaces are observed to\nfail to give accurate results for two reasons: the interface can get ``stuck''\non the lattice or a density overshoot develops around the interface. In the\nfirst case the bulk densities can take a range of values, dependent on the\ninitial conditions. In the second case inaccurate bulk densities are found. In\nthis communication we derive the minimum interface width required for the\naccurate simulation of liquid gas systems with a diffuse interface. We\ndemonstrate this criterion for lattice Boltzmann simulations of a van der Waals\ngas. When combining this criterion with predictions for the bulk stability we\ncan predict the parameter range that leads to stable and accurate simulation\nresults. This allows us to identify parameter ranges leading to high density\nratios of over 1000. This is despite the fact that lattice Boltzmann\nsimulations of liquid-gas systems were believed to be restricted to modest\ndensity ratios of less than 20.\n"}
{"text":"  An optical cavity enhances the interaction between atoms and light, and the\nrate of coherent atom-photon coupling can be made larger than all decoherence\nrates of the system. For single atoms, this strong coupling regime of cavity\nquantum electrodynamics (cQED) has been the subject of spectacular experimental\nadvances, and great efforts have been made to control the coupling rate by\ntrapping and cooling the atom towards the motional ground state, which has been\nachieved in one dimension so far. For N atoms, the three-dimensional ground\nstate of motion is routinely achieved in atomic Bose-Einstein condensates\n(BECs), but although first experiments combining BECs and optical cavities have\nbeen reported recently, coupling BECs to strong-coupling cavities has remained\nan elusive goal. Here we report such an experiment, which is made possible by\ncombining a new type of fibre-based cavity with atom chip technology. This\nallows single-atom cQED experiments with a simplified setup and realizes the\nnew situation of N atoms in a cavity each of which is identically and strongly\ncoupled to the cavity mode. Moreover, the BEC can be positioned\ndeterministically anywhere within the cavity and localized entirely within a\nsingle antinode of the standing-wave cavity field. This gives rise to a\ncontrolled, tunable coupling rate, as we confirm experimentally. We study the\nheating rate caused by a cavity transmission measurement as a function of the\ncoupling rate and find no measurable heating for strongly coupled BECs. The\nspectrum of the coupled atoms-cavity system, which we map out over a wide range\nof atom numbers and cavity-atom detunings, shows vacuum Rabi splittings\nexceeding 20 gigahertz, as well as an unpredicted additional splitting which we\nattribute to the atomic hyperfine structure.\n"}
{"text":"  Electron properties of graphene are described in terms of Dirac fermions.\nHere we thoroughly outline the elastic scattering theory for the\ntwo-dimensional massive Dirac fermions in the presence of an axially symmetric\npotential. While the massless limit is relevant for pristine graphene, keeping\nfinite mass allows for generalizations onto situations with broken symmetry\nbetween the two sublattices, and provides a link to the scattering theory of\nelectrons in a parabolic band. We demonstrate that the Dirac theory requires\nshort-distance regularization for potentials which are more singular than 1\/r.\nThe formalism is then applied to scattering off a smooth short-ranged\npotential. Next we consider the Coulomb potential scattering, where the Dirac\ntheory is consistent for a point scatterer only for the effective impurity\nstrength below 1\/2. From the scattering phase shifts we obtain the exact\nCoulomb transport cross-section in terms of the impurity strength. The results\nare relevant for transport in graphene in the presence of impurities that do\nnot induce scattering between the Dirac points in the Brillouin zone.\n"}
{"text":"  We carry out preliminary numerical study of Sugino's lattice formulation\n\\cite{Sugino:2004qd,Sugino:2004qdf} of the two-dimensional $\\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$\nsuper Yang-Mills theory (2d $\\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ SYM) with the gauge group\n$\\SU(2)$. The effect of dynamical fermions is included by re-weighting a\nquenched ensemble by the pfaffian factor. It appears that the complex phase of\nthe pfaffian due to lattice artifacts and flat directions of the classical\npotential are not problematic in Monte Carlo simulation. Various one-point\nsupersymmetric Ward-Takahashi (WT) identities are examined for lattice spacings\nup to $a=0.5\/g$ with the fixed physical lattice size $L=4.0\/g$, where $g$\ndenotes the gauge coupling constant in two dimensions. WT identities implied by\nan exact fermionic symmetry of the formulation are confirmed in fair accuracy\nand, for most of these identities, the quantum effect of dynamical fermions is\nclearly observed. For WT identities expected only in the continuum limit, the\nresults seem to be consistent with the behavior expected from supersymmetry,\nalthough we do not see clear distintion from the quenched simulation. We\nmeasure also the expectation values of renormalized gauge-invariant bi-linear\noperators of scalar fields.\n"}
{"text":"  Longitudinal data tracking repeated measurements on individuals are highly\nvalued for research because they offer controls for unmeasured individual\nheterogeneity that might otherwise bias results. Random effects or mixed models\napproaches, which treat individual heterogeneity as part of the model error\nterm and use generalized least squares to estimate model parameters, are often\ncriticized because correlation between unobserved individual effects and other\nmodel variables can lead to biased and inconsistent parameter estimates.\nStarting with an examination of the relationship between random effects and\nfixed effects estimators in the standard unobserved effects model, this article\ndemonstrates through analysis and simulation that the mixed model approach has\na ``bias compression'' property under a general model for individual\nheterogeneity that can mitigate bias due to uncontrolled differences among\nindividuals. The general model is motivated by the complexities of longitudinal\nstudent achievement measures, but the results have broad applicability to\nlongitudinal modeling.\n"}
{"text":"  In the field of tutoring systems, investigations have shown that there are\nmany tutoring systems specific to a specific domain that, because of their\nstatic architecture, cannot be adapted to other domains. As consequence, often\nneither methods nor knowledge can be reused. In addition, the knowledge\nengineer must have programming skills in order to enhance and evaluate the\nsystem. One particular challenge is to tackle these problems with the\ndevelopment of a generic tutoring system. AnITA, as a stand-alone application,\nhas been developed and implemented particularly for this purpose. However, in\nthe testing phase, we discovered that this architecture did not fully match the\nuser's intuitive understanding of the use of a learning tool. Therefore, AnITA\nhas been redesigned to exclusively work as a client\/server application and\nrenamed to AnITA2. This paper discusses the evolvements made on the AnITA\ntutoring system, the goal of which is to use generic principles for system\nre-use in any domain. Two experiments were conducted, and the results are\npresented in this paper.\n"}
{"text":"  Mesh numbering is a critical issue in Finite Element Methods, as the\ncomputational cost of one analysis is highly dependent on the order of the\nnodes of the mesh. This paper presents some preliminary investigations on the\nproblem of mesh numbering using Evolutionary Algorithms. Three conclusions can\nbe drawn from these experiments. First, the results of the up-to-date method\nused in all FEM softwares (Gibb's method) can be consistently improved; second,\nnone of the crossover operators tried so far (either general or problem\nspecific) proved useful; third, though the general tendency in Evolutionary\nComputation seems to be the hybridization with other methods (deterministic or\nheuristic), none of the presented attempt did encounter any success yet. The\ngood news, however, is that this algorithm allows an improvement over the\nstandard heuristic method between 12% and 20% for both the 1545 and 5453-nodes\nmeshes used as test-bed. Finally, some strange interaction between the\nselection scheme and the use of problem specific mutation operator was\nobserved, which appeals for further investigation.\n"}
{"text":"  We report a direct observational evidence for the existence of the galaxy\nspin alignments with the real space tidal field. We calculate the real space\ntidal field from the real space density field reconstructed recently from the\nTwo Mass Redshift Survey (2MRS) by Erdogdu et al. in 2006. Using a total of\n12122 nearby spiral galaxies from the Tully Galaxy Catalog, we calculate the\norientations of their spin axes relative to the 2MRS tidal field. We find a\nclear signal of the intrinsic correlations between the galaxy spins and the\nintermediate principal axes of the tidal shears. The null hypothesis of no\ncorrelation is rejected at 99.99 % confidence level. We also investigate the\ndependence of the intrinsic correlations on the galaxy morphological type and\nthe environment. It is found that (i) the intrinsic correlation depends weakly\non the morphological type of the spiral galaxies but tends to decrease slightly\nas the type increases; (ii) it is stronger in the high-density regions than in\nthe low-density regions. The observational result is quantitatively consistent\nwith analytic prediction based on the tidal torque theory. It is concluded that\nthe galaxy spin orientations may provide in principle a new complimentary probe\nof the dark matter distribution.\n"}
{"text":"  As well known, the b-boundaries of the closed Friedman world model and of\nSchwarzschild solution consist of a single point. We study this phenomenon in a\nbroader context of differential and structured spaces. We show that it is an\nequivalence relation $\\rho $, defined on the Cauchy completed total space\n$\\bar{E}$ of the frame bundle over a given space-time, that is responsible for\nthis pathology. A singularity is called malicious if the equivalence class\n$[p_0]$ related to the singularity remains in close contact with all other\nequivalence classes, i.e., if $p_0 \\in \\mathrm{cl}[p]$ for every $p \\in E$. We\nformulate conditions for which such a situation occurs. The differential\nstructure of any space-time with malicious singularities consists only of\nconstant functions which means that, from the topological point of view,\neverything collapses to a single point. It was noncommutative geometry that was\nespecially devised to deal with such situations. A noncommutative algebra on\n$\\bar{E}$, which turns out to be a von Neumann algebra of random operators,\nallows us to study probabilistic properties (in a generalized sense) of\nmalicious singularities. Our main result is that, in the noncommutative regime,\neven the strongest singularities are probabilistically irrelevant.\n"}
{"text":"  The free convolution is the binary operation on the set of probability\nmeasures on the real line which allows to deduce, from the individual spectral\ndistributions, the spectral distribution of a sum of independent unitarily\ninvariant square random matrices or of a sum of free operators in a non\ncommutative probability space. In the same way, the rectangular free\nconvolution allows to deduce, from the individual singular distributions, the\nsingular distribution of a sum of independent unitarily invariant rectangular\nrandom matrices. In this paper, we consider the regularization properties of\nthese free convolutions on the whole real line. More specifically, we try to\nfind continuous semigroups $(\\mu_t)$ of probability measures such that $\\mu_0$\nis the Dirac mass at zero and such that for all positive $t$ and all\nprobability measure $\\nu$, the free convolution of $\\mu_t$ with $\\nu$ (or, in\nthe rectangular context, the rectangular free convolution of $\\mu_t$ with\n$\\nu$) is absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure, with a\npositive analytic density on the whole real line. In the square case, we prove\nthat in semigroups satisfying this property, no measure can have a finite\nsecond moment, and we give a sufficient condition on semigroups to satisfy this\nproperty, with examples. In the rectangular case, we prove that in most cases,\nfor $\\mu$ in a continuous rectangular-convolution-semigroup, the rectangular\nconvolution of $\\mu$ with $\\nu$ either has an atom at the origin or doesn't put\nany mass in a neighborhood of the origin, thus the expected property does not\nhold.

{"text":"  Following an extensive survey of the galactic plane by the INTEGRAL\nsatellite, new hard X-ray sources are discovered with a significant fraction of\nCataclysmic Variables (CVs) among them. We report here the identification of\none of these hard X-ray sources, IGR J00234+6141, as an accreting magnetic\nwhite dwarf of intermediate polar type. We analyse the high energy emission of\nthe INTEGRAL source using all available data and provide complementary optical\nphotometric and spectroscopic data obtained respectively in August and October\n2006. Based on a refined INTEGRAL position, we confirm the proposed optical\nidentification. We clearly detect the presence of a 564 s periodic optical\nmodulation that we identify as the rotation of the white dwarf. The analysis of\nthe optical spectrum also demonstrates that the emission lines show a\nmodulation in radial velocity with an orbital period of Porb = (4.033 +\/-\n0.005) hr. The two periodicities indicate that IGR00234+6141 is a magnetic CV\nof the intermediate polar type. This is one of the faintest and hardest sources\nof this type detected by INTEGRAL.

{"text":"  In this paper, we model a nonlinear dynamics of infectious diseases transfer.\nParticularly, we study possible applications to tubercular infection in models\nwith different profiles (peak values) of the population density dependence on\nspatial coordinates.

{"text":"  Inflationary models with a superheavy scale F-term hybrid inflation followed\nby an intermediate scale modular inflation are considered. The restrictions on\nthe power spectrum P_R of curvature perturbation and the spectral index n_s\nfrom the recent data within the power-law cosmological model with cold dark\nmatter and a cosmological constant can be met provided that the number of\ne-foldings N_HI* suffered by the pivot scale k_*=0.002\/Mpc during hybrid\ninflation is suitably restricted. The additional e-foldings needed for solving\nthe horizon and flatness problems are generated by modular inflation with a\nstring axion as inflaton. For central values of P_R and n_s, the grand\nunification scale comes out, in the case of standard hybrid inflation, close to\nits supersymmetric value M_GUT=2.86 x 10^16 GeV, the relevant coupling constant\nis relatively large (0.005-0.14), and N_HI* is between 10 and 21.7.

{"text":"  An extension of the New Standard Model, by introducing a mixing of the low\nmass ``active'' neutrinos with heavy ones, or by any model with lepton flavor\nviolation, is considered. This leads to non-orthogonal neutrino production and\ndetection states and to modifications of neutrino oscillations in both, vacuum\nand matter. The possibility of the discovery of such effects in current and\nfuture neutrino oscillation experiments is discussed. First order approximation\nformulas for the flavor transition probabilities in constant density matter,\nfor all experimentally available channels, are given.

{"text":"  An integral PBW-basis of type $A_1^{(1)}$ has been constructed by Zhang [Z]\nand Chen [C] using the Auslander-Reiten quiver of the Kronecker quiver. We\nassociate a geometric order to elements in this basis following an idea of\nLusztig [L1] in the case of finite type. This leads to an algebraic realization\nof a bar-invariant basis of $\\uq2$. For any affine symmetric type, we obtain an\nintegral PBW-basis of the generic composition algebra, by using an algebraic\nconstruction of the integral basis for a tube in [DDX], an embedding of the\nmodule category of the Kronecker quiver into the module category of the tame\nquiver, and a list of the root vectors of indecomposable modules according to\nthe preprojective, regular, and preinjective components of the Auslander-Reiten\nquiver of the tame quiver.

{"text":"  We propose a method to reconstruct the vibrational quantum state of molecules\nexcited by a general excitation laser pulse. Unlike existing methods, we do not\nrequire the molecules before excitation to be in a pure state, allowing us to\ntreat the important case of initially thermally excited molecules. Even if only\na single initial level is appreciably populated, initial levels with small\npopulations can still give major contributions to the unknown vibrational\nstate, making it essential to take them into account. In addition to the\nexcitation pulse, the method uses two incident, short laser pulses in a\nnon-co-linear geometry to create four-wave mixing in the molecules. The\nmeasurements used in the reconstruction are spectra of the outgoing four-wave\nmixing pulse at different time delays of the excitation laser pulse. An\nimportant point is that the method does not require detailed knowledge of\nmolecular transition moments between excited states nor of any of the incoming\nlaser pulses, but circumvents this requirement by using one or more calibration\nlaser pulses in a separate experiment either before or after the main data are\nrecorded. The only requirements for the calibration laser pulses are that the\nconstant parts of their spectrums should together cover the spectral range of\nthe excitation laser pulse, and the constant part of each should have\nsufficient spectral overlap with one other calibration pulse to populate two of\nthe same levels. Finally, we discuss the extension of the reconstruction method\nin this paper to more general situations, hereby presenting the new idea of\nquantum state reconstruction through perturbations with calibration.\n"}
{"text":"  There are clear benefits associated with a particular consumer choice for\nmany current markets.

The question we pose is, how\ncan such an initially economically-disadvantaged green product evolve to hold\nthe greater share of the market? We present a simple mathematical model for the\ndynamics of product competition in a heterogeneous consumer population. Our\nmodel preassigns a hierarchy to the products, which designates the consumer\nchoice when prices are comparable, while prices are dynamically rescaled to\nreflect increasing returns to scale.

{"text":"  The influence of three well-known disaccharides, namely trehalose, maltose\nand sucrose, on some structural and dynamical properties of lysozyme has been\ninvestigated by means of molecular dynamics computer simulations in the 37-60\nwt % concentration range. The effects of sugars on the protein conformation are\nfound relatively weak, in agreement with the preferential hydration of\nlysozyme. Conversely, sugars seem to increase significantly the relaxation\ntimes of the protein. These effects are shown to be correlated to the\nfractional solvent accessibilities of lysozyme residues and further support the\nslaving of protein dynamics. Moreover, a significant increase in the relaxation\ntimes of lysozyme, sugars and water molecules is observed within the studied\nconcentration range and may result from the percolation of the hydrogen-bond\nnetwork of sugar molecules.

{"text":"  Some statistical properties of finite-time stability exponents in the\nstandard map can be estimated analytically. The mean exponent averaged over the\nentire phase space behaves quite differently from all the other cumulants.\nWhereas the mean carries information about the strength of the interaction, and\nonly indirect information about dynamical correlations, the higher cumulants\ncarry information about dynamical correlations and essentially no information\nabout the interaction strength. In particular, the variance and higher\ncumulants of the exponent are very sensitive to dynamical correlations and\neasily detect the presence of very small islands of regular motion via their\nanomalous time-scalings. The average of the stability matrix' inverse trace is\neven more sensitive to the presence of small islands and has a seemingly\nfractal behavior in the standard map parameter. The usual accelerator modes and\nthe small islands created through double saddle node bifurcations, which come\nhalfway between the positions in interaction strength of the usual accelerator\nmodes, are clearly visible in the variance, whose time scaling is capable of\ndetecting the presence of islands as small as 0.01% of the phase space. We\nstudy these quantities with a local approximation to the trace of the stability\nmatrix which significantly simplifies the numerical calculations as well as\nallows for generalization of these methods to higher dimensions. We also\ndiscuss the nature of this local approximation in some detail.\n"}
{"text":"  Closed-loop or feedback control ratchets use information about the state of\nthe system to operate with the aim of maximizing the performance of the system.\nIn this paper we investigate the effects of a time delay in the feedback for a\nprotocol that performs an instantaneous maximization of the center-of-mass\nvelocity. For the one and the few particle cases the flux decreases with\nincreasing delay, as an effect of the decorrelation of the present state of the\nsystem with the information that the controller uses, but the delayed\nclosed-loop protocol succeeds to perform better than its open-loop counterpart\nprovided the delays are smaller than the characteristic times of the Brownian\nratchet. For the many particle case, we also show that for small delays the\ncenter-of-mass velocity decreases for increasing delays. However, for large\ndelays we find the surprising result that the presence of the delay can improve\nthe performance of the nondelayed feedback ratchet and the flux can attain the\nmaximum value obtained with the optimal periodic protocol. This phenomenon is\nthe result of the emergence of a dynamical regime where the presence of the\ndelayed feedback stabilizes one quasiperiodic solution or several\n(multistability), which resemble the solutions obtained in the so-called\nthreshold protocol. Our analytical and numerical results point towards the\nfeasibility of an experimental implementation of a feedback controlled ratchet\nthat performs equal or better than its optimal open-loop version.\n"}
{"text":"  Context. X-ray flares are common phenomena in pre-main sequence stars. Their\nanalysis gives insights into the physics at work in young stellar coronae. The\nOrion Nebula Cluster offers a unique opportunity to study large samples of\nyoung low mass stars. This work is part of the Chandra Orion Ultradeep project\n(COUP), an ~10 day long X-ray observation of the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC).\nAims. Our main goal is to statistically characterize the flare-like variability\nof 165 low mass (0.1-0.3 M_sun) ONC members in order to test and constrain the\nphysical scenario in which flares explain all the observed emission. Methods.\nWe adopt a maximum likelihood piece-wise representation of the observed X-ray\nlight curves and detect flares by taking into account both the amplitude and\ntime derivative of the count-rate. We then derive the frequency and energy\ndistribution of the flares. Results. The high energy tail of the energy\ndistribution of flares is well described by a power-law with index 2.2. We test\nthe hypothesis that light curves are built entirely by overlapping flares with\na single power law energy distribution. We constrain the parameters of this\nsimple model for every single light curve. The analysis of synthetic light\ncurves obtained from the model indicates a good agreement with the observed\ndata. Comparing low mass stars with stars in the mass interval (0.9-1.2M_sun),\nwe establish that, at ~1 Myr, low mass and solar mass stars of similar X-ray\nluminosity have very similar flare frequencies. Conclusions. Our observational\nresults are consistent with the following model\/scenario: the light curves are\nentirely built by over- lapping flares with a power-law intensity distribution;\nthe intense flares are individually detected, while the weak ones merge and\nform a pseudo-quiescent level, which we indicate as the characteristic level.\n"}
{"text":"  Initial reaction rate data for lactic dehydrogenase \/ pyruvate, lactic\ndehydrogenase \/ lactate and malic dehydrogenase \/ malate enzyme reactions were\nanalyzed to obtain activation free energy changes of -329, -195 and -221\ncal\/mole, respectively, for rate increases associated with time-specific\nirradiation of the crystalline substrates prior to dissolution and\nincorporation in the reaction solutions.

{"text":"  We present a detailed study of soliton compression of ultra-short pulses\nbased on phase-mismatched second-harmonic generation (\\textit{i.e.}, the\ncascaded quadratic nonlinearity) in bulk quadratic nonlinear media. The\nsingle-cycle propagation equations in the temporal domain including\nhigher-order nonlinear terms are presented. The balance between the quadratic\n(SHG) and the cubic (Kerr) nonlinearity plays a crucial role: we define an\neffective soliton number -- related to the difference between the SHG and the\nKerr soliton numbers -- and show that it has to be larger than unity for\nsuccessful pulse compression to take place. This requires that the phase\nmismatch be below a critical level, which is high in a material where the\nquadratic nonlinearity dominates over the cubic Kerr nonlinearity. Through\nextensive numerical simulations we find dimensionless scaling laws, expressed\nthrough the effective soliton number, which control the behaviour of the\ncompressed pulses. These laws hold in the stationary regime, in which\ngroup-velocity mismatch effects are small, and they are similar to the ones\nobserved for fiber soliton compressors.

A strong\nAIB at 11.3 microns is detected in the HII region, relative to the other AIBs\nat 6.2, 7.7 and 8.6 microns. The intensity of this band appears to be\ncorrelated with the intensity of the [NeII] at 12.8 microns and of Halpha,\nwhich shows that the emitters of the 11.3 microns band are located in the\nionised gas.

{"text":"  Gravastars have been recently proposed as potential alternatives to explain\nthe astrophysical phenomenology traditionally associated to black holes,\nraising the question of whether the two objects can be distinguished at all.\nLeaving aside the debate about the processes that would lead to the formation\nof a gravastar and the astronomical evidence in their support, we here address\ntwo basic questions: Is a gravastar stable against generic perturbations?

To\nanswer these questions we construct a general class of gravastars and determine\nthe conditions they must satisfy in order to exist as equilibrium solutions of\nthe Einstein equations. For such models we perform a systematic stability\nanalysis against axial-perturbations, computing the real and imaginary parts of\nthe eigenfrequencies.

{"text":"  We introduce a novel method for calculating the size of the critical nucleus\nand the value of the surface tension in systems with first order phase\ntransition.

The frozen configuration creates a pinning field on the\nsurface of the free sphere. The pinning field forces the sphere to stay in the\nmetastable phase as long as its size is smaller than the critical nucleus. We\ntest our method in two first-order systems, both on a two-dimensional lattice:\na system where the parameter tuning the transition is the magnetic field, and a\nsecond system where the tuning parameter is the temperature. In both cases the\nresults are satisfying. Unlike previous techniques, our method does not require\nan infinite volume limit to compute the surface tension, and it therefore gives\nreliable estimates even by using relatively small systems.

{"text":"  The earliest phases of clustered star formation and the origin of the stellar\ninitial mass function (IMF) are currently much debated. In order to constrain\nthe origin of the IMF, we investigated the internal and relative motions of\nstarless condensations and protostars previously detected by us in the dust\ncontinuum at 1.2mm in the L1688 protocluster of the Ophiuchus molecular cloud\ncomplex. The starless condensations have a mass spectrum resembling the IMF and\nare therefore likely representative of the initial stages of star formation in\nthe protocluster. We carried out detailed molecular line observations,\nincluding some N2H+(1-0) mapping, of the Ophiuchus protocluster condensations\nusing the IRAM 30m telescope. We measured subsonic or at most transonic levels\nof internal turbulence within the condensations, implying virial masses which\ngenerally agree within a factor of ~ 2 with the masses derived from the 1.2mm\ndust continuum. This supports the notion that most of the L1688 starless\ncondensations are gravitationally bound and prestellar in nature. We measured a\nglobal one-dimensional velocity dispersion of less than 0.4 km\/s between\ncondensations. This small relative velocity dispersion implies that, in\ngeneral, the condensations do not have time to interact with one another before\nevolving into pre-main sequence objects. Our observations support the view that\nthe IMF is partly determined by cloud fragmentation at the prestellar stage.\nCompetitive accretion is unlikely to be the dominant mechanism at the\nprotostellar stage in the Ophiuchus protocluster, but it may possibly govern\nthe growth of starless, self-gravitating condensations initially produced by\ngravoturbulent fragmentation toward an IMF, Salpeter-like mass spectrum.\n"}

{"text":"  Although one-loop calculations provide a realistic description of bulk and\nsingle-particle nuclear properties, it is necessary to examine loop corrections\nto develop a systematic finite-density power-counting scheme for the nuclear\nmany-body problem when loops are included. Moreover, it is imperative to study\nexchange and correlation corrections systematically to make reliable\npredictions for other nuclear observables. One must also verify that the\nnatural sizes of the one-loop parameters are not destroyed by explicit\ninclusion of many-body corrections. The loop expansion is applied to a chiral\neffective hadronic lagrangian; with the techniques of Infrared Regularization,\nit is possible to separate out the short-range contributions and to write them\nas local products of fields that are already present in our lagrangian. (The\nappropriate field variables must be re-defined at each order in loops.) The\ncorresponding parameters implicitly include short-range effects to all orders\nin the interaction, so these effects need not be calculated explicitly. The\nremaining (long-range) contributions that must be calculated are nonlocal and\nresemble those in conventional nuclear-structure calculations.

{"text":"  Observations of gamma ray bursts (GRBs) with Swift produced the initially\nsurprising result that many bursts have large X-ray flares superimposed on the\nunderlying afterglow.

Some\nremarkable flares are observed with fluence comparable to the prompt GRB\nfluence. Many GRBs have several flares, which are sometimes overlapping. Short,\nintense, repetitive, and late flaring can be most easily understood within the\ncontext of the standard fireball model with the internal engine that powers the\nprompt GRB emission in an active state at late times. However, other models for\nflares have been proposed. Flare origin can be investigated by comparing the\nflare spectra to that of the afterglow and the initial prompt emission. In this\nwork, we have analyzed all significant X-ray flares from the first 110 GRBs\nobserved by Swift. From this sample 33 GRBs were found to have significant\nX-ray flares, with 77 flares that were detected above the 3$\\sigma$ level. In\naddition to temporal analysis presented in a companion paper, a variety of\nspectral models have been fit to each flare.

Using the\nvelocity coherence of the filaments, one can be traced back to its origin in\nwhat we identify as the SouthEast HI Overdensity (SEHO) of the Large Magellanic\nCloud (LMC), which includes 30 Doradus. Parts of the Leading Arm (LA) can also\nbe traced back to the SEHO in velocity and position. Therefore, at least\none-half of the trailing Stream and most of the LA originates in the LMC,\ncontrary to previous assertions that both the MS and the LA originate in the\nSmall Magellanic Cloud (SMC) and\/or in the Magellanic Bridge. The two MS\nfilaments show strong periodic, undulating spatial and velocity patterns that\nwe speculate are an imprint of the LMC rotation curve. If true, then the drift\nrate of the Stream gas away from the Magellanic Clouds is ~49 km\/s and the age\nof the MS is ~1.74 Gyr. The Staveley-Smith et al. high-resolution HI data of\nthe LMC show gas outflows from supergiant shells in the SEHO that seem to be\ncreating the LA and LMC filament of the MS. Blowout of LMC gas is an effect not\npreviously accounted for but one that probably plays an important role in\ncreating the MS and LA.\n"}
{"text":"  In this paper, we discuss an interaction between complex geometry and\nintegrable systems. Section 1 reviews the classical results on integrable\nsystems. New examples of integrable systems, which have been discovered, are\nbased on the Lax representation of the equations of motion. These systems can\nbe realized as straight line motions on a Jacobi variety of a so-called\nspectral curve. In section 2, we study a Lie algebra theoretical method leading\nto integrable systems and we apply the method to several problems. In section\n3, we discuss the concept of the algebraic complete integrability (a.c.i.) of\nhamiltonian systems. Algebraic integrability means that the system is\ncompletely integrable in the sens of the phase space being folited by tori,\nwhich in addition are real parts of a complex algebraic tori (abelian\nvarieties). The method is devoted to illustrate how to decide about the a.c.i.\nof hamiltonian systems and is applied to some examples. Finally, in section 4\nwe study an a.c.i. in the generalized sense which appears as covering of a.c.i.\nsystem. The manifold invariant by the complex flow is covering of abelian\nvariety.\n"}
{"text":"  In this work I discuss the necessary steps for deriving photometric redshifts\nfor luminous red galaxies (LRGs) and galaxy clusters through simple empirical\nmethods. The data used is from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). I show that\nwith three bands only ({\\it gri}) it is possible to achieve results as accurate\nas the ones obtained by other techniques, generally based on more filters. In\nparticular, the use of the $(g-i)$ color helps improving the final redshifts\n(especially for clusters), as this color monotonically increases up to $z \\sim\n0.8$. For the LRGs I generate a catalog of $\\sim 1.5$ million objects at $z <\n0.70$. The accuracy of this catalog is $\\sigma = 0.027$ for $z \\le 0.55$ and\n$\\sigma = 0.049$ for $0.55 < z \\le 0.70$. The photometric redshift technique\nemployed for clusters is independent of a cluster selection algorithm. Thus, it\ncan be applied to systems selected by any method or wavelength, as long as the\nproper optical photometry is available. When comparing the redshift listed in\nliterature to the photometric estimate, the accuracy achieved for clusters is\n$\\sigma = 0.024$ for $z \\le 0.30$ and $\\sigma = 0.037$ for $030 < z \\le 0.55$.\nHowever, when considering the spectroscopic redshift as the mean value of SDSS\ngalaxies on each cluster region, the accuracy is at the same level as found by\nother authors: $\\sigma = 0.011$ for $z \\le 0.30$ and $\\sigma = 0.016$ for $030\n< z \\le 0.55$. The photometric redshift relation derived here is applied to\nthousands of cluster candidates selected elsewhere.

In order to take into account\nthe effect of uncertainty, a probabilistic approach is proposed and a new kind\nof histogram, a dose-expected volume histogram, is introduced. The expected\nvalue of the volume in the region of interest receiving an absorbed dose equal\nor greater than a certain value is found using the probability distribution of\nthe dose at each point. A rectangular probability distribution is assumed for\nthis point dose, and a relationship is given for practical computations.

The structure is\nextended over more than 50 Mpc at redshift z=3.1, and exhibits a considerably\nweak angular correlation. Such properties of LAE distributions appear to be\nincompatible with the standard biased galaxy formation scenario in the CDM\ncosmology. In this paper, by considering the possibility that LAEs are\nshort-lived events, we attempt to build up the picture of LAEs concordant with\nthe CDM cosmology. We find that if the lifetime of LAEs is as short as (6.7 \\pm\n0.6) \\times 10^7 yr, the distributions of simulated galaxies successfully match\nthe extension and morphology of large-scale structure of LAEs at z=3.1, and\nalso the weak angular correlation function. This result implies that LAEs at\nz=3.1 do not necessarily reside in high density peaks, but tends to be located\nin less dense regions, in a different way from the expectation by the standard\nbiased galaxy formation scenario. In addition, we make a prediction for the\nangular correlation function of LAEs at redshifts higher than 3. It is found\nthat the prediction deviates from that by the standard biased galaxy formation\nscenario even at redshifts 4 < z < 6.\n"}

The pions were produced by proton\nbeams in a momentum range from 3 \\GeVc to 12 \\GeVc hitting a tantalum target\nwith a thickness of 5% of a nuclear interaction length. The angular and\nmomentum range covered by the experiment ($100 \\MeVc \\le p < 800 \\MeVc$ and\n$0.35 \\rad \\le \\theta <2.15 \\rad$) is of particular importance for the design\nof a neutrino factory.

The phase transitions\nof the system are generally split into an Ising transition and an XY\ntransition, but the sequence and the nature of the transitions depend on the\nratio between the anisotropic couplings. In the isotropic limit the XY\nvariables are expected to be disordered before the Ising variables when thermal\nor quantum fluctuations are turned on gradually. In the anisotropic limit with\nzero perpendicular hoppings, the finite temperature transition is a\nKosterlitz-Thouless transition driven by proliferation of hybrid half vortices,\nand the zero temperature quantum phase transition is split into a bond order\ntransition and a 3D XY transition, which can be driven by the condensation of\neither single vortices or half vortices. After the condensation of half\nvortices the resultant state is a Mott Insulator of paired bosons.

{"text":"  Persistent activity is postulated to drive neural network plasticity and\nlearning. To investigate its underlying cellular mechanisms, we developed a\nbiophysically tractable model that explains the emergence, sustenance, and\neventual termination of short-term persistent activity. Using the model, we\nreproduced the features of reverberating activity that were observed in small\n(50-100 cells) networks of cultured hippocampal neurons, such as the appearance\nof polysynaptic current clusters, the typical inter-cluster intervals, the\ntypical duration of reverberation, and the response to changes in\nextra-cellular ionic composition. The model relies on action\npotential-triggered residual presynaptic calcium, which we suggest plays an\nimportant role in sustaining reverberations. We show that reverberatory\nactivity is maintained by enhanced asynchronous transmitter release from\npre-synaptic terminals, which in itself depends on the dynamics of residual\npresynaptic calcium. Hence, asynchronous release, rather than being a \"synaptic\nnoise\", can play an important role in network dynamics. Additionally, we found\nthat a fast timescale synaptic depression is responsible for oscillatory\nnetwork activation during reverberations, whereas the onset of a slow timescale\ndepression leads to the termination of reverberation. The simplicity of our\nmodel enabled a number of predictions that were confirmed by additional\nanalyses of experimental manipulations.\n"}

{"text":"  The solar torsional oscillations, i.e., the perturbations of the angular\nvelocity of rotation associated with the eleven-year activity cycle, are a\nmanifestation of the interaction among the interior magnetic fields, amplified\nand modulated by the solar dynamo, and rotation, meridional flow and turbulent\nthermal transport. Therefore, they can be used, at least in principle, to put\nconstraints on that interaction. Similar phenomena are expected to be observed\nin solar-like stars and can be modelled to shed light on analogous interactions\nin different environments. The source of the torsional oscillations is\ninvestigated by means of a model for the angular momentum transport within the\nconvection zone. A description of the torsional oscillations is introduced,\nbased on an analytical solution of the angular momentum equation in the\nmean-field approach. It provides information on the intensity and location of\nthe torques producing the redistribution of the angular momentum within the\nconvection zone of the Sun along the activity cycle. The method can be extended\nto solar-like stars for which some information on the time-dependence of the\ndifferential rotation is becoming available. Illustrative applications to the\nSun and solar-like stars are presented. Under the hypothesis that the solar\ntorsional oscillations are due to the mean-field Lorentz force, the mean\namplitude of the Maxwell stresses and the phase relationship between poloidal\nand toroidal field components are obtained.

Attention\nis given to the approach toward the hard-sphere limit, and to the effect of\ndensity and temperature on the strength of the depletion potential. Our results\nindicate, surprisingly, that even a modest degree of softness in the pair\npotential governing the direct interactions between the particles may lead to a\nsignificantly more attractive total effective potential for the big spheres\nthan in the hard-sphere case.

{"text":"  We investigate the astrometric effects of stellar surface structures as a\npractical limitation to ultra-high-precision astrometry, e.g. in the context of\nexoplanet searches, and to quantify the expected effects in different regions\nof the HR-diagram.

We use theoretical considerations supported by Monte Carlo simulations\nto derive statistical relations between the corresponding astrometric,\nphotometric, and radial-velocity effects. For most stellar types the\nastrometric jitter due to stellar surface structures is expected to be of order\n10 micro-AU or greater. This is more than the astrometric displacement\ntypically caused by an Earth-size exoplanet in the habitable zone, which is\nabout 1-4 micro-AU for long-lived main-sequence stars. Only for stars with\nextremely low photometric variability (<0.5 mmag) and low magnetic activity,\ncomparable to that of the Sun, will the astrometric jitter be of order 1\nmicro-AU, suffcient to allow the astrometric detection of an Earth-sized planet\nin the habitable zone.

We then turn our attention specifically to those models for which\nthe exact distribution of microstates in the steady state can be expressed in a\nmatrix product form. In addition to a gentle introduction to this matrix\nproduct approach, how it works and how it relates to similar constructions that\narise in other physical contexts, we present a unified, pedagogical account of\nthe various means by which the statistical mechanical calculations of\nmacroscopic physical quantities are actually performed. We also review a number\nof more advanced topics, including nonequilibrium free energy functionals, the\nclassification of exclusion processes involving multiple particle species,\nexistence proofs of a matrix product state for a given model and more\ncomplicated variants of the matrix product state that allow various types of\nparallel dynamics to be handled.

However a better\ncharacterisation of these p modes is clearly needed to constrain theoretical\nmodels. We observed alpha Cen A during five nights using the HARPS spectrograph\nin order to improve our knowledge of the seismic properties of this star. We\nperformed high-precision radial-velocity sequences and computed the acoustic\nspectrum of alpha Cen A. We identify 34 p modes with angular degree l=0-3 in\nthe frequency range 1.8-2.9 mHz and amplitude range 13-48 cm\/s, in agreement\nwith previous seismic studies. We find an enhancement of the frequency scatter\nwith the angular degree l that indicates, considering the high inclination axis\nof alpha Cen A, rotational splitting and explains the low values of previously\nsuggested mode lifetimes. We also derive new values for the small separations\nthat take the effect of rotational splitting into account . Our seismic study\nof alpha Cen A leads to a list of now well identified p-mode frequencies and\nshows the importance of taking the rotation into account in order to properly\ncharacterise the p modes even in quite short campaigns.\n"}
{"text":"  Infrared spectra from the Spitzer Space Telescope (SSC) of many debris disks\nare well fit with a single black body temperature which suggest clearings\nwithin the disk. We assume that inside the clearing orbital instability due to\nplanets removes dust generating planetesimal belts and dust generated by the\nouter disk that is scattered or drifts into the clearing. From numerical\nintegrations we estimate a minimum planet spacing required for orbital\ninstability (and so planetesimal and dust removal) as a function of system age\nand planet mass. We estimate that a 10^8 year old debris disk with a dust disk\nedge at a radius of 50 AU hosted by an A star must contain approximately 5\nNeptune mass planets between the clearing radius and the iceline in order to\nremove all primordial objects within it. We infer that known debris disk\nsystems contain at least a fifth of a Jupiter mass in massive planets. The\nnumber of planets and spacing required is insensitive to the assumed planet\nmass. However an order of magnitude higher total mass in planets could reside\nin these systems if the planets are more massive.\n"}

A sufficient condition for a\nfunction to behave chaotically is that its Schwarzian derivative is negative.\nIn this paper, we try to find a sufficient condition for a non-linear dynamical\nsystem to behave chaotically. The solution function of this system is a higher\ndegree polynomial. We define n-th Schwarzian derivative to examine its general\nproperties. Our analysis shows that the sufficient condition for chaotic\nbehavior of higher order polynomial is provided if its highest order three\nterms satisfy an inequality which is invariant under the degree of the\npolynomial and the condition is represented by Hankel determinant of order 2.\nAlso the n-th order polynomial can be considered to be the partial sum of real\nvariable analytic function. Let this analytic function be the solution of\nnon-linear differential equation, then the sufficient condition for the\nchaotical behavior of this function is the Hankel determinant of order 2\nnegative, where the elements of this determinant are the coefficient of the\nterms of n, n-1, n-2 in Taylor expansion.\n"}
{"text":"  We study the orbital evolution of the 4 giant planets of our solar system in\na gas disk. Our investigation extends the previous works by Masset and\nSnellgrove (2001) and Morbidelli and Crida (2007, MC07), which focussed on the\ndynamics of the Jupiter-Saturn system. The only systems that we found to reach\na steady state are those in which the planets are locked in a quadruple mean\nmotion resonance (i.e. each planet is in resonance with its neighbor). In total\nwe found 6 such configurations. For the gas disk parameters found in MC07,\nthese configurations are characterized by a negligible migration rate. After\nthe disappearance of the gas, and in absence of planetesimals, only two of\nthese six configurations (the least compact ones) are stable for a time of\nhundreds of millions of years or more. The others become unstable on a\ntimescale of a few My. Our preliminary simulations show that, when a\nplanetesimal disk is added beyond the orbit of the outermost planet, the\nplanets can evolve from the most stable of these configurations to their\ncurrent orbits in a fashion qualitatively similar to that described in Tsiganis\net al.

{"text":"  An important feature of Kaluza-Klein theories is their ability to relate\nfundamental physical constants to the radii of higher dimensions. In previous\nKaluza-Klein theory, which unifies the electromagnetic field with gravity as\ndimensionless components of a Kaluza-Klein metric, i) all fields have the same\nphysical dimensions, ii) the Lagrangian has no explicit dependence on any\nphysical constants except mass, and hence iii) all physical constants in the\nfield equations except for mass originate from geometry. While it seems natural\nin Kaluza-Klein theory to add fermion fields by defining higher dimensional\nbispinor fields on the Kaluza-Klein manifold, these Kaluza-Klein theories do\nnot satisfy conditions (i), (ii), and (iii). In this paper, we show how\nconditions (i), (ii), and (iii) can be satisfied by including bispinor fields\nin a tetrad formulation of the Kaluza-Klein model, as well as in an equivalent\nteleparallel model. This demonstrates an unexpected feature of Dirac's bispinor\nequation, since conditions (i), (ii), (iii) imply a special relation among the\nterms in the Kaluza-Klein or teleparallel Lagrangian that would not be\nsatisfied in general.\n"}
{"text":"  We present a search for outflows towards 51 submillimetre cores in Perseus.\nWith consistently derived outflow properties from a large homogeneous dataset\nwithin one molecular cloud we can investigate further the mass dependence and\ntime evolution of protostellar mass loss. Of the 51 cores, 37 show broad\nlinewings indicative of molecular outflows. In 13 cases, the linewings could be\ndue to confusion with neighbouring flows but 9 of those sources also have\nnear-infrared detections confirming their protostellar nature. The total\nfraction of protostars in our sample is 65%. All but four outflow detections\nare confirmed as protostellar by Spitzer IR detections and only one Spitzer\nsource has no outflow, showing that outflow maps at this sensitivity are\nequally good at identifying protostars as Spitzer. Outflow momentum flux\ncorrelates both with source luminosity and with core mass but there is\nconsiderable scatter even within this one cloud despite the homogeneous\ndataset. We fail to confirm the result of Bontemps et al. (1996) that Class I\nsources show lower momentum fluxes on average than Class 0 sources, with a KS\ntest showing a significant probability that the momentum fluxes for both Class\n0s and Class Is are drawn from the same distribution. We find that outflow\npower may not show a simple decline between the Class 0 to Class I stages. Our\nsample includes low momentum flux, low-luminosity Class 0 sources, possibly at\na very early evolutionary stage. If the only mass loss from the core were due\nto outflows, cores would last for 10^5-10^8 years, longer than current\nestimates of 1.5-4 x 10^5 years for the mean lifetime for the embedded phase.\nAdditional mechanisms for removing mass from protostellar cores may be\nnecessary.\n"}

One finds that superexchange\ncontributes in all orbital ordered states, the Nagaoka theorem does not apply,\nand the kinetic energy is much enhanced as compared with the spin case.\nTherefore, orbital ordered states are harder to stabilize in the Hartree-Fock\napproximation (HFA), and the onset of a uniform ferro-orbital polarization and\nantiferro-orbital instability are similar to each other, unlike in spin case.\nNext we formulate a cubic (gauge) invariant slave boson approach using the\norbitals with complex coefficients.

{"text":"  Coherence and phase synchronization between time series corresponding to\ndifferent spatial locations are usually interpreted as indicators of the\nconnectivity between locations.

There are two\nproblems in this case. First, in the usual situation of unknown cortical\ngeometry, the estimated signal at each brain location is a vector with three\ncomponents (i.e. a current density vector), which means that coherence and\nphase synchronization must be generalized to pairs of multivariate time series.\nSecond, the inherent low spatial resolution of the EEG\/MEG tomography\nintroduces artificially high zero-lag coherence and phase synchronization.

{"text":"  We report the first time-series of broadband infrared (IR) color measurements\nof Sgr A*, the variable emission source associated with the supermassive black\nhole at the Galactic Center.

In\nspite of the large range of dereddened flux densities for Sgr A* (2-30 mJy),\nall of our near-IR measurements are consistent with a constant spectral index\nof alpha = -0.6+-0.2. Furthermore, this value is consistent with the spectral\nindices observed at X-ray wavelengths during nearly all outbursts; which is\nconsistent with the synchrotron self-Compton model for the production of the\nX-ray emission. During the coordinated observations, one IR outburst occurs <36\nmin after a possibly associated X-ray outburst, while several similar IR\noutbursts show no elevated X-ray emission. A variable X-ray to IR ratio and\nconstant infrared spectral index challenge the notion that the IR and X-ray\nemission are connected to the same electrons. We, therefore, posit that the\npopulation of electrons responsible for both the IR and X-ray emission are\ngenerated by an acceleration mechanism that leaves the bulk of the electron\nenergy distribution responsible for the IR emission unchanged, but has a\nvariable high-energy cutoff. Occasionally a tail of electrons >1 GeV is\ngenerated, and it is this high-energy tail that gives rise to the X-ray\noutbursts. One possible explanation for this type of variation is from the\nturbulence induced by a magnetorotational instability, in which the outer scale\nlength of the turbulence varies and changes the high-energy cutoff.\n"}

If for some\nreason the clusters are formed with non-random initial perturbation velocity\ndirection (measured for instance with respect to the direction of circular\nrotation), then a plot of the orientation angle of the residual velocity as a\nfunction of age reveals the epicycle frequency. The data analysis confirms that\nthis is the case; due to the non-random initial velocities, it is possible to\nmeasure $\\kappa$ for different galactic radii. Our analysis considers that the\neffect of the arms on the stellar orbits is small (the Galactic potential is\nmainly axis-symmetric); in this sense our results do not depend on any specific\nmodel of the spiral structure, like the existence of a given number of spiral\narms, or on a particular choice of the radius of corotation. The values of\n$\\kappa$ provide constraints on the rotation velocity of the disk and on its\nminimum beyond the solar radius; in particular, $V_0$ is found to be 226 $\\pm$\n15 kms$^{-1}$ even if the short scale (R$_0$ = 7.5 kpc) of the galaxy is\nadopted. The mesured $\\kappa$ at the solar radius is 42$\\pm$4\nkms$^{-1}$kpc$^{-1}$.\n"}

{"text":"  An exhaustive classification of certain class of static solutions for the\nfive-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory in vacuum is presented.

It is shown that for\ngeneric values of the coupling constants the base manifold must be necessarily\nof constant curvature, and the solution reduces to the topological extension of\nthe Boulware-Deser metric. It is also shown that the base manifold admits a\nwider class of geometries for the special case when the Gauss-Bonnet coupling\nis properly tuned in terms of the cosmological and Newton constants. This\nfreedom in the metric at the boundary, which determines the base manifold,\nallows the existence of three main branches of geometries in the bulk. For\nnegative cosmological constant, if the boundary metric is such that the base\nmanifold is arbitrary, but fixed, the solution describes black holes whose\nhorizon geometry inherits the metric of the base manifold. If the base manifold\npossesses a negative constant Ricci scalar, two different kinds of wormholes in\nvacuum are obtained. For base manifolds with vanishing Ricci scalar, a\ndifferent class of solutions appears resembling \"spacetime horns\". There is\nalso a special case for which, if the base manifold is of constant curvature,\ndue to certain class of degeneration of the field equations, the metric admits\nan arbitrary redshift function. For wormholes and spacetime horns, there are\nregions for which the gravitational and centrifugal forces point towards the\nsame direction.

{"text":"  We present a study on the dynamics of massive BHs in galaxy mergers, obtained\nfrom a series of high-resolution N-Body\/SPH simulations. The presence of a\ngaseous component is essential for the rapid formation of an eccentric\n(Keplerian) BH binary, that resides at the center of a massive (~10^9 Msun)\nturbulent nuclear disc. Using physically and\/or numerically motivated recipes,\nwe follow the accretion history of the BHs during the merger. The mass of the\nBHs increases as large central inflows of gas occur inside each galaxy, and\ntheir mass ratio varies with time. Given the encountered strong degeneracy\nbetween numerical resolution and physical assumptions, we suggest here three\npossible paths followed by the galaxies and the BHs during a merger in order to\nfulfill the M-sigma relation : Adjustment, Symbiosis, and BH Dominance. In an\nextremely high resolution run, we resolved the turbulent gas pattern down to\nparsec scales, and found that BH feedback is expected to be effective near the\nend of the merger. We then trace the BH binary orbit down to a scale of 0.1 pc\nmodeling the nuclear disc as an equilibrium Mestel disc composed either of gas,\ngas and stars, or just stars. Under the action of dynamical friction against\nthe rotating gaseous and\/or stellar background the orbit circularizes. When\nthis occurs, each BH is endowed with its own small-size (~0.01 pc) accretion\ndisc comprising a few percent of the BH mass. Double AGN activity is expected\nto occur on an estimated timescale of ~10 Myrs, comparable to the inspiral\ntime. The double nuclear point--like sources that may appear have typical\nseparations of ~10 pc, and are likely to be embedded in the still ongoing\nstarburst.\n"}

{"text":"  A method is given for solving an optimal H2 approximation problem for SISO\nlinear time-invariant stable systems.

This case exhibits special structure which\nallows us to provide a complete solution. The problem is converted into linear\nalgebra by exhibiting a finite-dimensional basis for a certain space, and can\nthen be solved by eigenvalue calculations, following the methods developed by\nStetter and Moeller. The use of Buchberger's algorithm is avoided by writing\nthe first-order optimality conditions in a special form, from which a Groebner\nbasis is immediately available.

These detailed spectral models clearly show considerable\ncomplexity and structure that is strongly affected by all these factors. The\npresence of sharp features in the XSCORT spectra contrasts strongly with both\nthe previous models and with the smooth nature of the observed X-ray spectra of\nAGN with soft X-ray excesses, demonstrating that accretion disk winds are\nunlikely to be the origin of this mysterious spectral feature. The most\nsignificant parameter affecting the presence of the sharp features in the\nmodels is the terminal velocity of the wind. Increasing the terminal velocity\nof the absorbing material to ~c, and hence dramatically increasing the velocity\ndispersion across the wind, could potentially remove these features resulting\nin a spectrum similar to the previous models. Such a fast moving outflow cannot\nbe associated with a radiatively driven accretion disk wind, however the\npresence of a highly relativistic jet may provide an origin for such material.\n"}
{"text":"  In this master thesis a configuration space method presented by C.

The\nadvantages of the method are that it needs neither mode summation nor analytic\ncontinuation from euclidean time, while delivering the propagators above\nincluding (i-epsilon)-prescription, plus as a nice bonus the conformal\ndimension of a corresponding CFT field. General properties of the considered\nspacetimes (namely various coordinate systems and their metrics, chordal\ndistances, relations between conformal dimensions \\Delta and the mass m of the\nscalar field, geodesics and the invariance of time ordering) are also examined\nand compiled from various sources, providing an overview of geometrical\nproperties of AdS and dS spacetimes.\n"}
{"text":"  We look for a simple analytic model to distinguish between stellar clusters\nundergoing a bimodal hydrodynamic solution from those able to drive only a\nstationary wind. Clusters in the bimodal regime undergo strong radiative\ncooling within their densest inner regions, which results in the accumulation\nof the matter injected by supernovae and stellar winds and eventually in the\nformation of further stellar generations, while their outer regions sustain a\nstationary wind. The analytic formulae are derived from the basic hydrodynamic\nequations. Our main assumption, that the density at the star cluster surface\nscales almost linearly with that at the stagnation radius, is based on results\nfrom semi-analytic and full numerical calculations. The analytic formulation\nallows for the determination of the threshold mechanical luminosity that\nseparates clusters evolving in either of the two solutions. It is possible to\nfix the stagnation radius by simple analytic expressions and thus to determine\nthe fractions of the deposited matter that clusters evolving in the bimodal\nregime blow out as a wind or recycle into further stellar generations.\n"}

{"text":"  We use recently introduced three-point dynamic susceptibilities to obtain an\nexperimental determination of the temperature evolution of the number of\nmolecules, N_corr, that are dynamically correlated during the structural\nrelaxation of supercooled liquids.

It does so in a\nmodest manner close to the glass transition, which is consistent with an\nactivation-based picture of the dynamics in glassforming materials. For higher\ntemperatures, there appears to be a regime where N_corr behaves as a power-law\nof the relaxation time.

{"text":"  We present a method to derive outflow velocities in the solar corona using\ndifferent data sets including solar wind mass flux coming from the SWAN\/SOHO\ninstrument, electron density values from LASCO-C2 and interplanetary solar wind\nvelocities derived from ground-based Interplanetary Scintillation Observations\n(IPS).\n  In a first step, we combine the LASCO electron densities at 6 solar radii and\nthe IPS velocities, and compare the product to the SWAN mass fluxes. It is\nfound that this product represents the actual mass flux at 6 solar radii for\nthe fast wind, but not for the slow wind. In regions dominated by the slow\nwind, the fluxes derived from SWAN are systematically smaller. This is\ninterpreted as a proof that the fast solar wind has reached its terminal\nvelocity at about 6 solar radii and expands with constant velocity beyond this\ndistance. On the contrary, the slow solar wind has reached only half of its\nterminal value and is thus accelerated further out.\n  In a second step, we combine the LASCO-C2 density profiles and the SWAN flux\ndata to derive velocity profiles in the corona between 2.5 and 6 solar radii.\nSuch profiles can be used to test models of the acceleration mechanism of the\nfast solar wind.\n"}

{"text":"  In view of the newly discovered and physically acceptable $PT$ symmetric and\nnon-Hermitian models, we reinvestigated the phase structure of the\n($g\\phi^{4}+h\\phi^{6}$)$_{1+1}$ Hermitian model. The reinvestigation concerns\nthe possibility of a phase transition from the original Hermitian and $PT$\nsymmetric phase to a non-Hermitian and $PT$ symmetric one. This kind of phase\ntransition, if verified experimentally, will lead to the first proof that\nnon-Hermitian and $PT$ symmetric models are not just a mathematical research\nframework but are a nature desire. To do the investigation, we calculated the\neffective potential up to second order in the couplings and found a Hermitian\nto Non-Hermitian phase transition. This leads us to introduce, for the first\ntime, hermiticity as a symmetry which can be broken due to quantum corrections,\n\\textit{i.e.}, when starting with a model which is Hermitian in the classical\nlevel, quantum corrections can break hermiticity while the theory stays\nphysically acceptable. In fact, ignoring this phase will lead to violation of\nuniversality when comparing this model predictions with other models in the\nsame class of universality. For instance, in a previous work we obtained a\nsecond order phase transition for the $PT$ symmetric and non-Hermitian\n$(-g\\phi^{4})$ and according to universality, this phase should exist in the\nphase structure of the ($g\\phi^{4}+h\\phi^{6}$) model for negative $g$. Finally,\namong the novelties in this letter, in our calculation for the effective\npotential, we introduced a new renormalization group equation which describes\nthe invariance of the bare vacuum energy under the change of the scale. We\nshowed that without this invariance, the original theory and the effective one\nare inequivalent.\n"}

{"text":"  We calculate the systematic inhomogeneity-induced correction to the\ncosmological constant that one would infer from an analysis of the luminosities\nand redshifts of Type Ia supernovae, assuming a homogeneous universe. The\ncalculation entails a post-Newtonian expansion within the framework of second\norder perturbation theory, wherein we consider the effects of subhorizon\ndensity perturbations in a flat, dust dominated universe. Within this\nformalism, we calculate luminosity distances and redshifts along the past light\ncone of an observer. The resulting luminosity distance-redshift relation is fit\nto that of a homogeneous model in order to deduce the best-fit cosmological\nconstant density Omega_Lambda. We find that the luminosity distance-redshift\nrelation is indeed modified, by a small fraction of order 10^{-5}. When fitting\nthis perturbed relation to that of a homogeneous universe, we find that the\ninferred cosmological constant can be surprisingly large, depending on the\nrange of redshifts sampled. For a sample of supernovae extending from z=0.02\nout to z=0.15, we find that Omega_Lambda=0.004. The value of Omega_Lambda has a\nlarge variance, and its magnitude tends to get larger for smaller redshifts,\nimplying that precision measurements from nearby supernova data will require\ntaking this effect into account. However, we find that this effect is likely\ntoo small to explain the observed value of Omega_Lambda=0.7. There have been\nprevious claims of much larger backreaction effects. By contrast to those\ncalculations, our work is directly related to how observers deduce cosmological\nparameters from astronomical data.\n"}

This is one in a series of papers in which we discuss issues involved\nin deriving accurate 3-He\/H abundance ratios from the available measurements.\nHere we describe the ionization correction we use to convert the 3-He+\/H+\nabundance, y3+, to the 3-He\/H abundance, y3. In principle the nebular\nionization structure can significantly influence the y3 derived for individual\nsources. We find that in general there is insufficient information available to\nmake a detailed ionization correction. Here we make a simple correction and\nassess its validity. The correction is based on radio recombination line\nmeasurements of H+ and 4-He+, together with simple core-halo source models. We\nuse these models to establish criteria that allow us to identify sources that\ncan be accurately corrected for ionization and those that cannot. We argue that\nthis effect cannot be very large for most of the sources in our observational\nsample. For a wide range of models of nebular ionization structure we find that\nthe ionization correction factor varies from 1 to 1.8.

The difficulty in\napplying the algorithm to higher dimensional systems is mainly due to the fact\nthat the number of stabilising transformations grows extremely fast with\nincreasing system dimension. In this thesis, we construct stabilising\ntransformations based on the knowledge of the stability matrices of already\ndetected periodic orbits (used as seeds). The advantage of our approach is in a\nsubstantial reduction of the number of transformations, which increases the\nefficiency of the detection algorithm, especially in the case of\nhigh-dimensional systems.

This idea is strengthened by the analogy with the polarization\nproperties of BL Lac objects, providing also further support to the FRI\/BL Lac\nunified model. This confirms previous suggestions that the dominant emission\nmechanism in low luminosity radio-loud AGN is related to non-thermal radiation\nproduced by the base of their jets. In addition to the nuclear polarization\n(and to the large scale optical jets), polarization is detected co-spatially\nwith the dusty circumnuclear disks, likely due to dichroic transmission; the\npolarization vectors are tangential to the disks as expected when the magnetic\nfield responsible for the grains alignment is stretched by differential\nrotation.

{"text":"  In this paper we consider the question of the degree to which negative and\npositive energy are intertwined. We examine in more detail a previously studied\nquantum state of the massless minimally coupled scalar field, which we call a\n``Helfer state''. This is a state in which the energy density can be made\narbitrarily negative over an arbitrarily large region of space, but only at one\ninstant in time. In the Helfer state, the negative energy density is\naccompanied by rapidly time-varying energy fluxes. It is the latter feature\nwhich allows the quantum inequalities, bounds which restrict the magnitude and\nduration of negative energy, to hold for this class of states. An observer who\ninitially passes through the negative energy region will quickly encounter\nfluxes of positive energy which subsequently enter the region. We examine in\ndetail the correlation between the energy density and flux in the Helfer state\nin terms of their expectation values. We then study the correlation function\nbetween energy density and flux in the Minkowski vacuum state, for a massless\nminimally coupled scalar field in both two and four dimensions. In this latter\nanalysis we examine correlation functions rather than expectation values.\nRemarkably, we see qualitatively similar behavior to that in the Helfer state.\nMore specifically, an initial negative energy vacuum fluctuation in some region\nof space is correlated with a subsequent flux fluctuation of positive energy\ninto the region. We speculate that the mechanism which ensures that the quantum\ninequalities hold in the Helfer state, as well as in other quantum states\nassociated with negative energy, is, at least in some sense, already\n``encoded'' in the fluctuations of the vacuum.\n"}

Proper motion errors are typically\n1 mas\/yr and field dependent systematics are below 0.2 mas\/yr.\nCross-referencing with the 2MASS catalog yielded a sample of ~8,700 stars, from\nwhich predominantly disk and bulge subsamples were selected photometrically\nfrom the JH color-magnitude diagram. The two samples exhibited different\nproper-motion distributions, with the disk displaying the expected reflex solar\nmotion as a function of magnitude. Galactic rotation was also detected for\nstars between ~2 and ~3 kpc from us. The bulge sample, represented by red\ngiants, has an intrinsic proper motion dispersion of (sigma_l,sigma_b)=(3.39,\n2.91)+\/-(0.11,0.09) mas\/yr, which is in good agreement with previous results,\nand indicates a velocity anisotropy consistent with either rotational\nbroadening or tri-axiality. A mean distance of 6.37^{+0.87}_{-0.77} kpc has\nbeen estimated for the bulge sample, based on the observed K magnitude of the\nhorizontal branch red clump.

{"text":"  We outline a dynamical dark energy scenario whose signatures may be\nsimultaneously tested by astronomical observations and laboratory experiments.\nThe dark energy is a field with slightly sub-gravitational couplings to matter,\na logarithmic self-interaction potential with a scale tuned to $\\sim 10^{-3}\n{\\rm eV}$, as is usual in quintessence models, and an effective mass $m_\\phi$\ninfluenced by the environmental energy density. Its forces may be suppressed\njust below the current bounds by the chameleon-like mimicry, whereby only outer\nlayers of mass distributions, of thickness $1\/m_\\phi$, give off appreciable\nlong range forces. After inflation and reheating, the field is relativistic,\nand attains a Planckian expectation value before Hubble friction freezes it.\nThis can make gravity in space slightly stronger than on Earth. During the\nmatter era, interactions with nonrelativistic matter dig a minimum close to the\nPlanck scale. However, due to its sub-gravitational matter couplings the field\nwill linger away from this minimum until the matter energy density dips below\n$\\sim 10^{-12} {\\rm eV}^4$. Then it starts to roll to the minimum, driving a\nperiod of cosmic acceleration. Among the signatures of this scenario may be\ndark energy equation of state $w \\ne -1$, stronger gravity in dilute mediums,\nthat may influence BBN and appear as an excess of dark matter, and\nsub-millimeter corrections to Newton's law, close to the present laboratory\nlimits.\n"}

The strong upward trend at\nthe lower frequencies indicates the presence of upward-traveling disturbances.\nIt points to correspondence between the lower chromosphere and the upper\ntransition region, perhaps by slow-mode magnetosonic disturbances, or by a\nconnection between chromospheric and coronal heating mechanisms. The transition\nfrom this upward trend to zero phase difference at higher frequencies is due to\nthe intermittent obscuration by fibrils that occult the foot points of hot\nloops, which are bright in the EUV and C IV lines, in oscillatory manner.\n"}

{"text":"  The generation interval is the time between the infection time of an infected\nperson and the infection time of his or her infector.

In this paper, we specify a general\nstochastic SIR epidemic model and prove that the mean generation interval\ndecreases when susceptible persons are at risk of infectious contact from\nmultiple sources. The intuition behind this is that when a susceptible person\nhas multiple potential infectors, there is a ``race'' to infect him or her in\nwhich only the first infectious contact leads to infection. In an epidemic, the\nmean generation interval contracts as the prevalence of infection increases. We\ncall this global competition among potential infectors. When there is rapid\ntransmission within clusters of contacts, generation interval contraction can\nbe caused by a high local prevalence of infection even when the global\nprevalence is low. We call this local competition among potential infectors.\nUsing simulations, we illustrate both types of competition.\n  Finally, we show that hazards of infectious contact can be used instead of\ngeneration intervals to estimate the time course of the effective reproductive\nnumber in an epidemic. This approach leads naturally to partial likelihoods for\nepidemic data that are very similar to those that arise in survival analysis,\nopening a promising avenue of methodological research in infectious disease\nepidemiology.\n"}

The same\nconstraint applies to any discrete gauge symmetry, as well as to other\nquantum-mechanically detectable black hole charges that are associated with the\nmassive quantum hair of the black hole.

This model describes rings with zero or weak intervalley\nscattering so that the valley isospin is a good quantum number. The tunable\nbreaking of the valley degeneracy by the flux allows for the controlled\nmanipulation of valley isospins.

On the other\nhand, strongly favouring the hydrogen-like interactions give rise to an\nanisotropic folded (solid-like) phase on lowering the temperature. We use Monte\nCarlo simulations up to a length of 256 to map out the phase diagram in the\nplane of parameters and determine the order of the associated phase\ntransitions. We discuss the connections to semi-flexible polymers and other\npolymer models. Importantly, we demonstrate that for a range of energy\nparameters two phase transitions occur on lowering the temperature, the second\nbeing a transition from the globule state to the crystal state. We argue from\nour data that this globule-to-crystal transition is continuous in two\ndimensions in accord with field-theory arguments concerning Hamiltonian walks,\nbut is first order in three dimensions.\n"}
{"text":"  We study the infrared (IR) properties of high-redshift galaxies using deep\nSpitzer 24, 70, and 160 micron data. Our primary interest is to improve the\nconstraints on the total IR luminosities, L(IR), of these galaxies. We combine\nthe Spitzer data in the southern Extended Chandra Deep Field with a\nK-band-selected galaxy sample and photometric redshifts from the\nMultiwavelength Survey by Yale-Chile. We used a stacking analysis to measure\nthe average 70 and 160 micron flux densities of 1.5 < z < 2.5 galaxies as a\nfunction of 24 micron flux density, X-ray activity, and rest-frame near-IR\ncolor. Galaxies with 1.5 < z < 2.5 and S(24)=53-250 micro-Jy have L(IR) derived\nfrom their average 24-160 micron flux densities within factors of 2-3 of those\nderived from the 24 micron flux densities only. However, L(IR) derived from the\naverage 24-160 micron flux densities for galaxies with S(24) > 250 micro-Jy and\n1.5 < z < 2.5 are lower than those derived using only the 24 micron flux\ndensity by factors of 2-10. Galaxies with S(24) > 250 micro-Jy have S(70)\/S(24)\nflux ratios comparable to sources with X-ray detections or red rest-frame IR\ncolors, suggesting that warm dust possibly heated by AGN may contribute to the\nhigh 24 micron emission. Based on the average 24-160 micron flux densities,\nnearly all 24 micron-selected galaxies at 1.5 < z < 2.5 have L(IR) < 6 x 10^12\nsolar luminosities, which if attributed to star formation corresponds to < 1000\nsolar masses per year. This suggests that high redshift galaxies may have\nsimilar star formation efficiencies and feedback processes as local analogs.\nObjects with L(IR) > 6 x 10^12 solar luminosities are quite rare, with a\nsurface density ~ 30 +\/- 10 per sq. deg, corresponding to ~ 2 +\/- 1 x 10^-6\nMpc^-3 over 1.5 < z < 2.5.\n"}

{"text":"  Context. Many efforts are being made to characterize extrasolar planetary\nsystems and unveil the fundamental mechanisms of planet formation. An important\naspect of the problem, which remains largely unknown, is to understand how the\nplanet formation process depends on the mass of the parent star. In particular,\nas most planets discovered to date orbit a solar-mass primary, little is known\nabout planet formation around more massive stars. Aims. To investigate this\npoint, we present first results from a radial velocity planet search around red\ngiants in the clump of intermediate-age open clusters. We choose clusters\nharbouring red giants with masses between 1.5 and 4 M_sun, using the well-known\ncluster parameters to accurately determine the stellar masses. We are therefore\nexploring a poorly-known domain of primary masses, which will bring new\ninsights into the properties of extrasolar planetary systems. Methods. We are\nfollowing a sample of about 115 red giants with the Coralie and HARPS\nspectrographs to obtain high-precision radial velocity (RV) measurements and\ndetect giant planets around these stars. We use bisector and activity index\ndiagnostics to distinguish between planetary-induced RV variations and stellar\nphotospheric jitter. Results. We present the discoveries of a giant planet and\na brown dwarf in the open clusters NGC 2423 and NGC 4349, orbiting the 2.4\nM_sun-star NGC2423 No3 (TYC 5409-2156-1) and the 3.9 M_sun-star NGC4349 No127\n(TYC 8975-2606-1).

{"text":"  In this article, localized linear defect modes due to bandgap guidance in\ntwo-dimensional photonic lattices with localized or non-localized defects are\ninvestigated theoretically. First, when the defect is localized and weak,\neigenvalues of defect modes bifurcated from edges of Bloch bands are derived\nanalytically. It is shown that in an attractive (repulsive) defect, defect\nmodes bifurcate out from Bloch-band edges with normal (anomalous) diffraction\ncoefficients. Furthermore, distances between defect-mode eigenvalues and\nBloch-band edges are exponentially small functions of the defect strength,\nwhich is very different from the one-dimensional case where such distances are\nquadratically small with the defect strength. It is also found that some\ndefect-mode branches bifurcate not from Bloch-band edges, but from quasi-edge\npoints within Bloch bands, which is very unusual. Second, when the defect is\nlocalized but strong, defect modes are determined numerically. It is shown that\nboth the repulsive and attractive defects can support various types of defect\nmodes such as fundamental, dipole, quadrupole, and vortex modes. These modes\nreside in various bandgaps of the photonic lattice. As the defect strength\nincreases, defect modes move from lower bandgaps to higher ones when the defect\nis repulsive, but remain within each bandgap when the defect is attractive,\nsimilar to the one-dimensional case. The same phenomena are observed when the\ndefect is held fixed while the applied dc field (which controls the lattice\npotential) increases. Lastly, if the defect is non-localized (i.e. it persists\nat large distances in the lattice), it is shown that defect modes can be\nembedded inside the continuous spectrum, and they can bifurcate out from edges\nof the continuous spectrum algebraically rather than exponentially.\n"}

Lett. 98, 200404 (2007)]. For two coupled 1d Bose\ngases the coherence factor is observed to approach a non-zero equilibrium value\nas predicted by a Bogoliubov approach. This coupled-system decay to finite\ncoherence is the matter wave equivalent of phase locking two lasers by\ninjection. The non-equilibrium dynamics of superfluids plays an important role\nin a wide range of physical systems, such as superconductors, quantum-Hall\nsystems, superfluid Helium, and spin systems. Our experiments studying\ncoherence dynamics show that 1d Bose gases are ideally suited for investigating\nthis class of phenomena.\n"}

{"text":"  This paper investigates faceting mechanisms induced by electromigration in\nthe regime where atomic steps are transparent. For this purpose we study\nseveral vicinal orientations by means of in-situ (optical diffraction,\nelectronic microscopy) as well as ex-situ (AFM, microprofilometry)\nvisualization techniques. The data show that faceting proceeds in two stages.\nThe first stage is short and leads to the appearance of a step density wave,\nwith a wavelength roughly independent of the surface orientation. The second\nstage is much slower, and leads to the formation of a hill-and-valley\nstructure, the period of which depends on the initial surface orientation. A\nsimple continuum model enables us to point out why the wavelength of the step\ndensity wave does not depend on the microscale details of the surface. The\nfinal wavelength is controlled by the competition between elastic step-step\ninteraction and facet edge energy cost. Finally, the surface stress angular\ndependence is shown to emerge as a coarsed-grained picture from the step model.\n"}
{"text":"  In the modern Bayesian view classical probability theory is simply an\nextension of conventional logic, i.e., a quantitative tool that allows for\nconsistent reasoning in the presence of uncertainty.

Invoking basic consistency requirements pertaining to the\npreparation and composition of systems, as well as to the continuity of\nprobabilities, I show that the modified theory must have an internal symmetry\nisomorphic to the unitary group.

We suggest that NGC 891 is intrinsically almost\nsymmetric and the large asymmetry in H$\\alpha$ emission is mostly due to dust\nattenuation. We will quantify the additional optical depth needed to cause the\nobserved asymmetry in this model. By comparing large strips on the North East\nside of the galaxy with strips covering the same area in the South West we can\nquantify and analyze the asymmetry in the different wavelengths. From the 24\n$\\mu$m emission we find that the intrinsic asymmetry in star formation in NGC\n891 is small i.e., $\\sim 30%$.

The photometric data indicate that the spot\ncoverage of the K dwarf component was less than observed in the past,\nsuggesting that we monitored the star close to a minimum in its activity cycle.\nDespite the low spot activity, we still detected seven flare-like events whose\nestimated energies are among the highest ever observed in V471 Tau and whose\ntimes of occurrence do not correlate with the binary orbital phase. A detailed\nO-C analysis of the times of eclipse over the last ~35 years reveals timing\nvariations which could be explained in several ways, including perturbations by\nan as-yet-undetected third body in the system or by a small orbital\neccentricity inducing slow apsidal motion. The DDO spectra result in improved\ndeterminations of the K dwarf projected rotation velocity, V_K sin i = 92 km\ns^-1, and the orbital amplitude, K_K=150.5 km s^-1. The spectra also allow us\nto measure changes in H_alpha emission strength and radial velocity (RV)\nvariations.

{"text":"  In this article we derive longitudinal impedance and wake function for an\nundulator setup with arbitrary undulator parameter, taking into account a\nfinite transverse size of the electron bunch. Earlier studies considered a line\ndensity-distribution of electrons instead. We focus our attention on the\nlong-wavelength asymptote (compared with resonance wavelength), at large\ndistance of the electron bunch from the undulator entrance compared to the\novertaking length, and for large vacuum-chamber size compared to the typical\ntransverse size of the field. These restrictions define a parameter region of\ninterest for practical applications. We calculate a closed expression for\nimpedance and wake function that may be evaluated numerically in the most\ngeneral case. Such expression allows us to derive an analytical solution for a\nGaussian transverse and longitudinal bunch shape. Finally, we study the\nfeasibility of current-enhanced SASE schemes (ESASE) recently proposed for\nLCLS, that fall well-within our approximations. Numerical estimations presented\nin this paper indicate that impedance-induced energy spread is sufficient to\nseriously degrade the FEL performance. Our conclusion is in contrast with\nresults in literature, where wake calculations for the LCLS case are given in\nfree-space, as if the presence of the undulator were negligible.\n"}

A comparison\nof the observed HI line fluxes obtained with the two different telescopes,\ncharacterized by half-power beam widths of 9 arcmin and 21 arcmin respectively,\nexploits a ``beam matching'' technique to yield a statistical determination of\nthe occurrence of diffuse HI components in their disks. A simple model of the\nHI distribution within a galaxy well describes ~75 % of the sample and accounts\nfor all of the HI line flux density. The remaining galaxies are approximately\nevenly divided into two categories: ones which appear to possess a\nsignificantly more extensive HI distribution than the model predicts, and ones\nfor which the HI distribution is more centrally concentrated than predicted.\nExamples of both extremes can be found in the literature but little attention\nhas been paid to the centrally concentrated HI systems.

The ratio of\nmagnetic to rotational kinetic energy in these configurations is chosen to be\nsmall (1% and 10%). We find that such magnetic fields do not affect the initial\ncollapse significantly. The core collapses to a black hole, after which black\nhole excision is employed to continue the evolution long enough for the hole to\nreach a quasi-stationary state. We find that the black hole mass is M_h = 0.95M\nand its spin parameter is J_h\/M_h^2 = 0.7, with the remaining matter forming a\ntorus around the black hole. We freeze the spacetime metric (\"Cowling\napproximation\") and continue to follow the evolution of the torus after the\nblack hole has relaxed to quasi-stationary equilibrium. In the absence of\nmagnetic fields, the torus settles down following ejection of a small amount of\nmatter due to shock heating.

Using the same set of metal transitions in the\nUV and applying known ISM structures in NGC1705, we find that NGC1705-1\nresembles distant GRB host galaxies in its high neutral gas column, low\nmolecular gas fraction, low metallicity, alpha-element enhancement,and low dust\ndepletion. The lack of molecular gas is due to the enhanced UV radiation field\nin the starburst environment, consistent with the expectations for GRB\nprogenitors. In addition, the known presence of dense neutral gas clouds at\nr<500 pc from NGC1705-1 provides a natural reservoir of C^+, Si^+, and Fe^+\nions that may be subsequently excited by the afterglow UV radiation field to\nproduce excited lines commonly seen in GRB host ISM. We further argue that the\napparent offset in the velocity profiles of low- and high-ionization\ntransitions from absorption-line observations alone already offers important\nclues for related starburst episodes in GRB host galaxies.

{"text":"  Great part of the interest in complex networks has been motivated by the\npresence of structured, frequently non-uniform, connectivity. Because diverse\nconnectivity patterns tend to result in distinct network dynamics, and also\nbecause they provide the means to identify and classify several types of\ncomplex networks, it becomes important to obtain meaningful measurements of the\nlocal network topology. In addition to traditional features such as the node\ndegree, clustering coefficient and shortest path, motifs have been introduced\nin the literature in order to provide complementary description of the networks\nconnectivity. The current work proposes a new type of motifs, namely chains of\nnodes, namely sequences of connected nodes with degree two. These chains have\nbeen subdivided into cords, tails, rings and handles, depending on the type of\ntheir extremities (e.g. open or connected). A theoretical analysis of the\ndensity of such motifs in random and scale free networks is described, and an\nalgorithm for identifying those motifs in general networks is presented. The\npotential of considering chains for network characterization has been\nillustrated with respect to five categories of real-world networks including 16\ncases. Several interesting findings were obtained, including the fact that\nseveral chains were observed in the real-world networks, especially the WWW,\nbooks, and power-grid. The possibility of chains resulting from incompletely\nsampled networks is also investigated.\n"}
{"text":"  We present a detailed study of the structural behavior and polarization\nreversal mechanism in phase III of KNO$_3$, an unusual ferroelectric material\nin which the nitrate groups rotate during polarization reversal. This material\nwas one of several studied in a previous work [O. Di\\'eguez and D. Vanderbilt,\nPhys. Rev. Lett. {\\bf 96}, 056401 (2006)] where methods were described for\ncomputing curves of energy versus electric polarization. In the present work we\nextend and systematize the previous first-principles calculations on KNO$_3$,\nand analyze in detail a two-parameter model in which the energy of the system\nis written as a low-order expansion in the polarization and the nitrate group\norientation. We confirm that this model reproduces the first-principles results\nfor KNO$_3$ very well and construct its parameter-space phase diagram,\ndescribing regions where unusual triple-well potentials appear. We also present\nfirst-principles calculations of KNO$_3$ under pressure, finding that its\nenergy-versus-polarization curves change character by developing a\nfirst-derivative discontinuity at zero polarization.\n"}
{"text":"  Opacities and chemical abundance data are crucial ingredients of ultracool\ndwarf and extrasolar giant planet atmosphere models. We report here on the\ndetailed sources of molecular opacity data employed by our group for this\napplication. We also present tables of Rosseland and Planck mean opacities\nwhich are of use in some studies of the atmospheres, interiors, and evolution\nof planets and brown dwarfs. For the tables presented here we have included the\nopacities of important atomic and molecular species, including the alkali\nelements, pressure induced absorption by hydrogen, and other significant\nopacity sources but neglect opacity from condensates. We report for each\nspecies how we have assembled molecular line data from a combination of public\ndatabases, laboratory data that is not yet in the public databases, and our own\nnumerical calculations. We combine these opacities with abundances computed\nfrom a chemical equilibrium model using recently revised solar abundances to\ncompute mean opacities. The chemical equilibrium calculation accounts for the\nsettling of condensates in a gravitational field, and is applicable to\nultracool dwarf and extrasolar planetary atmospheres, but not circumstellar\ndisks. We find that the inclusion of alkali atomic opacity substantially\nincreases the mean opacities over those currently in the literature at\ndensities relevant to the atmospheres and interiors of giant planets and brown\ndwarfs. We provide our opacity tables for public use and discuss their\nlimitations.\n"}
{"text":"  If the cold dark matter consists of weakly interacting massive particles\n(WIMPs), anticipated measurements of the WIMP properties at the Large Hadron\nCollider (LHC) and the International Linear Collider (ILC) will provide an\nunprecedented experimental probe of cosmology at temperatures of order 1 GeV.\nIt is worth emphasizing that the expected outcome of these tests may or may not\nbe consistent with the picture of standard cosmology. For example, in\nkination-dominated quintessence models of dark energy, the dark matter relic\nabundance can be significantly enhanced compared to that obtained from freeze\nout in a radiation-dominated universe. Collider measurements then will\nsimultaneously probe both dark matter and dark energy. In this article, we\ninvestigate the precision to which the LHC and ILC can determine the dark\nmatter and dark energy parameters under those circumstances. We use an\nillustrative set of four benchmark points in minimal supergravity in analogy\nwith the four LCC benchmark points. The precision achievable together at the\nLHC and ILC is sufficient to discover kination-dominated quintessence, under\nthe assumption that the WIMPs are the only dark matter component. The LHC and\nILC can thus play important roles as alternative probes of both dark matter and\ndark energy.\n"}
{"text":"  We report on interferometric and radial-velocity observations of the\ndouble-lined 51-d period binary (A) component of the quadruple pre-main\nsequence (PMS) system V773 Tau. With these observations we have estimated\npreliminary visual and physical orbits of the V773 Tau A subsystem. Among other\nparameters, our orbit model includes an inclination of 66.0 $\\pm$ 2.4 deg, and\nallows us to infer the component dynamical masses and system distance. In\nparticular we find component masses of 1.54 $\\pm$ 0.14 and 1.332 $\\pm$ 0.097\nM$_{\\sun}$ for the Aa (primary) and Ab (secondary) components respectively.\n  Our modeling of the subsystem component spectral energy distributions finds\ntemperatures and luminosities consistent with previous studies, and coupled\nwith the component mass estimates allows for comparison with PMS stellar models\nin the intermediate-mass range. We compare V773 Tau A component properties with\nseveral popular solar-composition models for intermediate-mass PMS stars. All\nmodels predict masses consistent to within 2-sigma of the dynamically\ndetermined values, though some models predict values that are more consistent\nthan others.\n"}
{"text":"  Let $\\alpha$ be a polynomial Poisson bivector on a finite-dimensional vector\nspace $V$ over $\\mathbb{C}$. Then Kontsevich [K97] gives a formula for a\nquantization $f\\star g$ of the algebra $S(V)^*$. We give a construction of an\nalgebra with the PBW property defined from $\\alpha$ by generators and\nrelations. Namely, we define an algebra as the quotient of the free tensor\nalgebra $T(V^*)$ by relations $x_i\\otimes x_j-x_j\\otimes x_i=R_{ij}(\\hbar)$\nwhere $R_{ij}(\\hbar)\\in T(V^*)\\otimes\\hbar \\mathbb{C}[[\\hbar]]$, $R_{ij}=\\hbar\n\\Sym(\\alpha_{ij})+\\mathcal{O}(\\hbar^2)$, with one relation for each pair of\n$i,j=1...\\dim V$. We prove that the constructed algebra obeys the PBW property,\nand this is a generalization of the Poincar\\'{e}-Birkhoff-Witt theorem. In the\ncase of a linear Poisson structure we get the PBW theorem itself, and for a\nquadratic Poisson structure we get an object closely related to a quantum\n$R$-matrix on $V$. At the same time we get a free resolution of the deformed\nalgebra (for an arbitrary $\\alpha$).\n  The construction of this PBW algebra is rather simple, as well as the proof\nof the PBW property.

{"text":"  In this paper we develop a consistent, phenomenological methodology to\nmeasure preferred-frame effects (PFEs) in binary pulsars that exhibit a high\nrate of periastron advance. We show that in these systems the existence of a\npreferred frame for gravity leads to an observable characteristic `signature'\nin the timing data, which uniquely identifies this effect. We expand the\nstandard Damour-Deruelle timing formula to incorporate this `signature' and\nshow how this new PFE timing model can be used to either measure or constrain\nthe parameters related to a violation of the local Lorentz invariance of\ngravity in the strong internal fields of neutron stars. In particular, we\ndemonstrate that in the presence of PFEs we expect a set of the new timing\nparameters to have a unique relationship that can be measured and tested\nincontrovertibly. This new methodology is applied to the Double Pulsar, which\nturns out to be the ideal test system for this kind of experiments.The\ncurrently available dataset allows us only to study the impact of PFEs on the\norbital precession rate, d omega\/dt, providing limits that are, at the moment,\nclearly less stringent than existing limits on PFE strong-field parameters.\nHowever, simulations show that the constraints improve fast in the coming\nyears, allowing us to study all new PFE timing parameters and to check for the\nunique relationship between them. Finally, we show how a combination of several\nsuitable systems in a \"PFE antenna array\", expected to be availabe for instance\nwith the Square-Kilometre-Array (SKA), provides full sensitivity to possible\nviolations of local Lorentz invariance in strong gravitational fields in all\ndirections of the sky. This PFE antenna array may eventually allow us to\ndetermine the direction of a preferred frame should it exist.\n"}
{"text":"  The utilization of multiple phosphorylation sites in regulating a biological\nresponse is ubiquitous in cell signaling. If each site contributes an\nadditional, equivalent binding site, then one consequence of an increase in the\nnumber of phosphorylations may be to increase the probability that, upon\ndisassociation, a ligand immediately rebinds to its receptor. How such effects\nmay influence cell signaling systems has been less studied. Here, a\nself-consistent integral equation formalism for ligand rebinding, in\nconjunction with Monte Carlo simulations, is employed to further investigate\nthe effects of multiple, equivalent binding sites on shaping biological\nresponses. Multiple regimes that characterize qualitatively different physics\ndue to the differential prevalence of rebinding effects are predicted.\nCalculations suggest that when ligand rebinding contributes significantly to\nthe dose response, a purely allovalent model can influence the binding curves\nnonlinearly. The model also predicts that ligand rebinding in itself appears\ninsufficient to generative a highly cooperative biological response.\n"}
{"text":"  Given an abelian algebraic group $A$ over a global field $F$, $\\alpha \\in\nA(F)$, and a prime $\\ell$, the set of all preimages of $\\alpha$ under some\niterate of $[\\ell]$ generates an extension of $F$ that contains all\n$\\ell$-power torsion points as well as a Kummer-type extension. We analyze the\nGalois group of this extension, and for several classes of $A$ we give a simple\ncharacterization of when the Galois group is as large as possible up to\nconstraints imposed by the endomorphism ring or the Weil pairing. This Galois\ngroup encodes information about the density of primes $\\p$ in the ring of\nintegers of $F$ such that the order of $(\\alpha \\bmod{\\p})$ is prime to $\\ell$.\nWe compute this density in the general case for several classes of $A$,\nincluding elliptic curves and one-dimensional tori.

{"text":"  One of the greatest challenges in solar and stellar physics in coming years\nwill be to observe the Second Solar Spectrum with a spatial resolution\nsignificantly better than 1 arcsec. This type of scattering polarization\nobservations would probably allow us to discover hitherto unknown aspects of\nthe Sun's hidden magnetism. Here we report on some theoretical predictions for\nthe photospheric line of Sr I at 4607 \\AA, which we have obtained by solving\nthe three-dimensional (3D) radiative transfer problem of scattering line\npolarization in a realistic hydrodynamical model of the solar photosphere. We\nhave taken into account not only the anisotropy of the radiation field in the\n3D medium and the Hanle effect of a tangled magnetic field, but also the\nsymmetry breaking effects caused by the horizontal atmospheric inhomogeneities\nproduced by the solar surface convection. Interestingly, the Q\/I and U\/I linear\npolarization signals of the emergent spectral line radiation have sizable\nvalues and fluctuations, even at the very center of the solar disk where we\nmeet the forward scattering case. The ensuing small-scale patterns in Q\/I and\nU\/I turn out to be sensitive to the assumed magnetic field model, and are of\ngreat diagnostic value. We argue that it should be possible to observe them\nwith the help of a 1-m telescope equipped with adaptive optics and a suitable\npolarimeter.\n"}
{"text":"  This paper concerns the solution of the self-consistency equation for energy\ngap parameter $\\Delta_{\\bf k}$ in the BCS theory of superconductivity. We show\nthat there exists a well-defined relation between the solution for energy gap\nparameter amplitude $|\\Delta_{\\bf k}|$ for a general interaction $V_{{\\bf\nk},{\\bf k}'}$ and energy gap $\\Delta$ obtained by using the cut-off\napproximation. The relation between $|\\Delta_{\\bf k}|$ and $\\Delta$ indicates\nthat $\\Delta$ is a weighted average over $|\\Delta_{\\bf k}|$ of electronic\nstates within cut-off energy $\\xi_c$ around the Fermi surface. In this\ninterpretation for $\\Delta$, $\\xi_c$ is not a property of $V_{{\\bf k},{\\bf\nk}'}$, but a parameter specifying the energy range within which the weighted\naverage over $|\\Delta_{\\bf k}|$ is taken. We show that the proper choice for\nthe value of $\\xi_c$ is only a few $k_BT_c$ (i.e., $\\xi_c\/k_BT_c$ is about 3 or\n4). We also show that the cut-off approximation, even with\n$\\xi_c\/k_BT_c=\\infty$, is a good approximation when it is used to calculate\nquantities such as the condensation energy and the specific heat, but it leads\nto significant overestimation for the Josephson critical current density of a\nJosephson junction if $\\xi_c\/k_BT_c \\gg 1$ is assumed.\n"}
{"text":"  We present a microscopic theory for superconductivity in a magnetic field\nbased on a local approximation approach. We derive an expression for free\nenergy density $F$ as a function of temperature $T$ and vector potential {\\bf\na}, and two basic equations of the theory: the first is an implicit solution\nfor energy gap parameter amplitude $|\\Delta_{\\bf k}|$ as a function of wave\nvector {\\bf k}, temperature $T$ and vector potential {\\bf a}; and the second is\na London-like relation between electrical current density {\\bf j} and vector\npotential {\\bf a}, with an ``effective superconducting electron density'' $n_s$\nthat is both $T$- and {\\bf a}-dependent. The two equations allow determination\nof spatial variations of {\\bf a} and $|\\Delta_{\\bf k}|$ in a superconductor for\ngiven temperature $T$, applied magnetic field ${\\bf H}_a$ and sample geometry.\nThe theory shows the existence of a ``partly-paired state,'' in which paired\nelectrons (having $|\\Delta_{\\bf k}|>0$) and de-paired electrons (having\n$|\\Delta_{\\bf k}|=0$) co-exist. Such a ``partly-paired state'' exists even at\nT=0 when $H_a$ is above a threshold for a given sample, giving rise to a\nnon-vanishing Knight shift at T=0 for $H_a$ above the threshold. We expect the\ntheory to be valid for highly-local superconductors for all temperatures and\nmagnetic fields below the superconducting transition. In the low-field limit,\nthe theory reduces to the local-limit result of BCS. As examples, we apply the\ntheory to the case of a semi-infinite superconductor in an applied magnetic\nfield ${\\bf H}_a$ parallel to the surface of the superconductor and the case of\nan isolated vortex in an infinite superconductor, and determine, in each case,\nspatial variations of quantities such as {\\bf a} and $|\\Delta_{\\bf k}|$.

{"text":"  Two methods of constraining the properties of dark energy are weak lensing\ntomography and cluster counting. Uncertainties in mass calibration of clusters\ncan be reduced by using the properties of halo clustering (the clustering of\nclusters). However, within a single survey, weak lensing and halo clustering\nprobe the same density fluctuations. We explore the question of whether this\ninformation can be used twice -- once in weak lensing and then again in halo\nclustering to calibrate cluster masses -- or whether the combined dark energy\nconstraints are weaker than the sum of the individual constraints. For a survey\nlike the Dark Energy Survey (DES), we find that the cosmic shearing of source\ngalaxies at high redshifts is indeed highly correlated with halo clustering at\nlower redshifts. Surprisingly, this correlation does not degrade cosmological\nconstraints for a DES-like survey, and in fact, constraints are marginally\nimproved since the correlations themselves act as additional observables. This\nconsiderably simplifies the analysis for a DES-like survey: when weak lensing\nand halo clustering are treated as independent experiments, the combined dark\nenergy constraints (cluster counts included) are accurate if not slightly\nconservative. Our findings mirror those of Takada and Bridle, who investigated\ncorrelations between the cosmic shear and cluster counts.\n"}
{"text":"  Models which accelerate the expansion of the universe through the addition of\na function of the Ricci scalar f(R) leave a characteristic signature in the\nlarge-scale structure of the universe at the Compton wavelength scale of the\nextra scalar degree of freedom.

Due to theoretical uncertainties\nin the nonlinear evolution of f(R) models, the galaxy power spectrum\nconservatively yields only weak constraints on the models despite the strong\npredicted signature in the linear matter power spectrum. Currently the tightest\nconstraints involve the modification to the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect from\ngrowth of gravitational potentials during the acceleration epoch.

{"text":"  We reconsider parity violation experiments in atomic hydrogen and deuterium\nin the light of existing tests of the Electroweak interactions, and assess\nwhether new experiments, using improved experimental techniques, could make\nuseful contributions to testing the Standard Model (SM). We find that, if\nparity experiments in hydrogen can be done, they remain highly desirable\nbecause there is negligible atomic-physics uncertainty and low energy tests of\nweak neutral current interactions are needed to probe for new physics beyond\nthe SM. Of particular interest would be a measurement of the nuclear spin\nindependent coupling C_{1D} for the deuteron at a combined error (theory +\nexperiment) of 0.3%.

{"text":"  Human heart rate is known to display complex fluctuations. Evidence of\nmultifractality in heart rate fluctuations in healthy state has been reported\n[Ivanov et al., Nature {\\bf 399}, 461 (1999)].
