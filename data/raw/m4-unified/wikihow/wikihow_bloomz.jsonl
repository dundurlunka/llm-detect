In addition there were over 100 tracks made specifically for this game.   \n\nThe Xbox 360 controller can be used to play this game but not all buttons work properly so you'll need to learn which ones do.  \nThere are two ways to start playing;  either insert the DVD into the console's tray then select \"Forza Motorsport 4\" when prompted, or download the game onto your hard drive first before starting up the program itself.\n\nOnce you've started the game, you're greeted with an introductory movie showing off the graphics capabilities of the system followed by a brief tutorial explaining basic controls such as:   Turning - Left stick.

If you're going to buy games via credit card instead, see How To Purchase Virtual Consoles Games Via A Credit Card below.   You can also find out more about purchasing games here.    Find some Wii Points cards from game stores such as GameStop or BestBuy (you may need to ask an employee).

This means if there is tension between siblings, then tensions may also be present among their spouses and\/or children.   In order to stop all these fights from occurring again, you'll need to take steps now before things get out of hand.    The first step towards stopping constant arguments with someone close to you should always begin by sitting down face-to-face with said individual and having an honest conversation regarding what's wrong.  Talk openly and honestly without pointing fingers or making accusations against each other.  Instead try focusing more on how you can fix any problems so that you don't continue arguing over the same issues repeatedly.  For example, say something like this:  \"I really want our relationship to become better because I care deeply...\"   \"I've noticed lately we've been getting into heated arguments quite often....\" \"I'm willing to change my ways but I'd love to hear what you'd suggest we start doing differently?\" You might find yourself thinking that there's nothing left to repair after years of conflict with another member of your family.

Play around with scales,    arpeggios,   chord progressions,  etc..     Get used to hearing yourself play these basic elements over and over again until they become second nature to you.    Then add more complexity gradually.    This will help you develop your ear and improve your sense of timing and rhythm.    It'll also allow you to explore new ways of expressing yourself musically.    When starting off learning improvise, you'll probably find yourself stuck at times because there won't always come along something that's immediately appealing to you.   That's perfectly normal!!"}

This guide has just helped you save hundreds (or even thousands) of dollars....  The first step towards making money when you sell your car is knowing exactly how much it\u2019s worth.   Unfortunately, that\u2019s easier said than done \u2014 especially since each year\u2019s model changes its appearance slightly while retaining similar features.  That means that the same exact car sold new last year won\u2019t be valued quite like today\u2019s version does.  But don\u2019t worry!  With these tips below, you\u2019ll be able to figure out roughly how much your car is worth without having to call around to multiple dealers.  How do I determine my car\u2019s current value?  Before you begin searching online for information regarding your specific car\u2019s value, consider whether you\u2019d rather sell yours privately or through a dealer.  While both options have their advantages and disadvantages, here are three things to remember:   Private sales tend to net higher prices due to fewer middlemen involved; however, finding someone who wants to purchase your car immediately can prove difficult.  Dealerships typically provide lower prices per unit sold compared to private parties; however, they\u2019re also likely to handle paperwork related to registration transfers, insurance claims, warranty issues, and other matters associated with purchasing a car.  Dealer fees vary widely depending upon location, type of sale being conducted, and the overall experience level of the seller\/dealer; however, expect to spend anywhere between 1\u20135% of the total transaction fee.  Buying directly from a dealer tends to result in better deals during auctions such as eBay Motors, Craigslist, AutoTrader, and others.  However, note that auction websites often require additional fees ranging from $5\u201315 USD plus shipping costs which must be paid upfront prior to bidding and\/or delivery of the item(s)."}

You'll usually get anywhere between 1-5 free bids when you first sign up depending upon what website you choose.    Some sites will allow you to purchase additional bids while others won't.     When you make...your initial bid(s), they may tell you how much money you'd spend per hour if you were to continue bidding until someone else beat you down....or something similar.

{"text":"The following steps are for guidance only; they may be different depending upon what type of weapon you're using.  Always follow manufacturer's instructions when handling firearms.   The most important thing about shooting any kind of weapon safely is:  Never point an unloaded weapon towards anything that's alive!   This will help keep you calm while aiming.     Aim carefully before pulling the trigger.    You should aim where you want the bullet to hit rather than where you'd like the bullet to go.        Shoot slowly but surely. Don't try to shoot too fast because you'll probably miss.      Keep practicing; it's all part of learning how to handle weapons properly. When firing a bolt-action rifle, open the bolt first so there's room for another round if necessary.  Then load magazines until they're full.  Some rifles require special magazines which hold more rounds per mag.  Check this information beforehand!  Make sure each magazine has been loaded correctly according to its specifications.  For example, some magazines must be inserted straight down instead of angled slightly upwards... Once you've opened the bolt, check whether there's already a round in the chamber.  If yes,  take off the magazine cover and pull out the empty shell casing.  Replace it with a new cartridge.  Close the magazine cover again after replacing the shell case.  There might also be a small lever next to the magazine cover called \"bolt catch\".  Pull it downwards once the magazine cover is closed.

Continue reading \u2192\n\nInstall an Accumulator\/Receiver-Dryer:  The first step after removing any remaining gasoline vapors is installing an accumulator\/dryer between the compressor discharge line and the condenser outlet header tank.  These devices contain desiccated material such as silica gel inside them that absorb moisture from the compressed air stream before it enters the condensers.  They also help remove excess water vapor created during compression.  You should never run without these units installed because they protect against corrosion caused by condensation within the lines.     Remove the old dryer and install the new one using the same mounting bracket and clamps.  Be careful about how much force you use while tightening down the clamps; too much could damage the rubber gasket around the drain hole.  Don't forget to connect the charging hose to the top side of the accumulator\/dryer!     Replace the Old Orifices Tubes:   After replacing the accumulator\/dryers it's time to check the orifice tubes again; make sure they're clean and free of debris!  Then you'll need to replace those that were damaged or worn-out.  You'll probably find two sets of orifice tubes; one set goes directly to each evaporator core and another pair connects both cores together via the expansion valves.  It's important to note here that there must always be equal flow through each orifice tube regardless of whether only one or both fans are running.  Otherwise, the vehicle's temperature control won't function properly.  There are several different types of orifice tubes available depending upon what type of vehicle you own.  Consult your owner's manual and\/or consult with someone who knows their way around automotive cooling systems...."}

Keep an eye open at home while everyone's distracted with dinner preparations; this will give you more than enough time to search without getting into trouble.   Don't forget to check under beds!   You can also try checking behind furniture like couches and dressers.     When searching inside drawers,... \nTry asking them directly!  This may sound obvious, but sometimes people just need reminding...and you'll get bonus points by doing it early rather than late....    Consider buying back whatever it is that's missing.  It doesn't matter who hides things anymore - even adults do it now and again.  Just make sure you ask first!     Have fun finding your lost treasure!"}

{"text":"If you're thinking about getting a new pet\u2014especially one that's not very common in households\u2014the first thing is probably figuring out how much work it entails.  Cats require lots of attention; they need daily exercise, grooming, playing, eating regularly at set times every day\u2014and all this takes up quite some time!  If you've never had a cat before, consider taking care of another household pet such as a dog so you know exactly what's involved when caring for animals.   You should also think carefully about where you'd keep the cat while away during the day since most cats don't do well being left alone too long without company.  For example, would you leave them home by themselves? Or take them along wherever you go?  Think about these things now rather than later! Once you've decided that having a cat makes sense for you, then comes choosing which kind of cat you'd like best.  There are many different breeds available ranging... Continue reading \u2192\n\nOnce you've chosen a breed, there are still plenty of options open to you:  Do you want a male or female cat?\nDo you want a pedigreed cat or just something cute and cuddly?\nAre you looking for a particular coloration?\n\nYou might find that certain types of cats suit your personality better than others.  Some people love energetic little kittens who demand constant attention, whereas others enjoy older cats whose personalities seem mellowed down after years living together.  Others simply fall in love with their own unique appearance.  Whatever your reasons, make sure they're strong ones!\nThe next step involves considering health issues associated with each breed.  Kittens generally develop faster physically than adults; however, they tend to get sick more often due to their lack of immunity against diseases.  Adult cats usually aren't as active as kittens, although they tend to live longer lives overall.  The main concern regarding adult cats is that they could already carry disease-causing viruses within their bodies.  This means that even though they've been vaccinated previously, there's always a chance they'll pass those infections onto younger cats around them.  In addition,..."}

{"text":"Patriotism has been defined many ways over time.  Some people have used it to justify slavery while others have fought against tyranny using their love for their homeland.   The definition of being a \"patriot\" varies from one culture to another.    In this section we examine some definitions of patriotism along with biblical principles which may help us determine if our love for our country qualifies us to call ourselves Christians.\n\nWhat Is A \"Patriot\"?\nThe word \"patriot\" comes from the Greek \"\u03c0\u03ac\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2\" meaning \"native land citizen\";   however, its modern usage refers more specifically...

He\/she does not use violence unless necessary to defend herself\/himself or family members threatened physically. ...A true patriot protects life rather than destroys it; he\/she works hard to provide for everyone's needs without exploiting anyone else.\"[1]"}

Keeping them clean is important because it's where your chickens spend most of their lives!  This guide will show you exactly what needs to happen during each step so you know what's expected before getting started!   Keep reading if you'd like more information!\nBefore we begin, let's talk about why keeping our chicken coop clean matters.\n\nKeeping Your Chickens Healthy:  The healthiest way to keep your chickens healthy is by making sure they're living in a clean environment.  Dirt and bacteria buildup inside the coop can cause respiratory problems as well as skin infections.    Keeping Your Roosting Area Clean:  When your chickens lay eggs,... Continue Reading... \nDropping Boards\n\nThese are wooden planks underneath the roosting area which collect poop and urine.  They also provide insulation against cold nights.  You want these areas to remain dry at all times since wetness encourages mold growth.  \n\nIf you've got old ones laying around somewhere, use those instead; however, don't forget to remove any nails first.  Otherwise, buy some cheap pine lumber that's roughly 1 inch thick.  Cut two long strips into 4 foot lengths using a circular saw.  Then cut another 2 short strips measuring 3 feet 6 inches wide x 8 feet long.  These last few cuts aren't necessary but they'll help save space later on while storing the boards until needed again. \n\nNext, attach one of the longer strips onto either side of the shorter strip using a nail gun.  Repeat this process along both sides of the board creating a rectangle shape.  Once done, repeat the same steps above with the remaining three boards.  Finally, place the four rectangles together forming a square box-like structure.  Nailing the corners together creates a sturdy frame that won't collapse under its own weight once filled with litter material.  Don't worry too much about straight lines here - just try to create something stable enough to hold itself upright without collapsing.

{"text":"This wikiHow will teach you how to build a woven stick fort using only sticks.  This method does require some digging but no special tools.   The finished product should resemble a small cave-like structure made from sticks covered with vegetation.    Building this type of fort requires patience because there isn't much room for error when building the frame.     It also takes time to gather enough materials (sticks) so plan accordingly!     For best results try to find sticks near water sources such as streams or rivers since these areas tend to contain large amounts of dead wood which makes great material for forts.      To begin gathering sticks start looking along riverbanks, forest edges, and other places where dead branches may accumulate.       ... Continue reading \u2192\n...    Laying down sticks horizontally creates layers of sticks inside each other creating a strong base for the rest of the fort's construction.    When laying horizontal sticks place them parallel to one another rather than perpendicularly.   In order to create a sturdy foundation layered sticks must be placed close together; however too many vertical sticks would prevent airflow through the fort making it difficult to breathe during warmer months.       Vertical sticks are used primarily to support the weight of horizontal sticks above them; therefore placing vertical sticks closer together increases stability while decreasing ventilation.    Horizontal sticks are laid first followed by vertical sticks.    After completing the initial framework it's important to insulate the interior of the fort before continuing onto finishing touches.    Insulation helps keep warmth trapped within the fort during cold weather and keeps coolness locked away during hot summer days.    Stuffing the gaps between sticks with leaves, grasses, mosses etc prevents drafts from entering the fort allowing heat generated by body heat to remain inside instead of escaping outside.    A good rule-of-thumb is to fill every gap completely leaving nothing exposed except for the surface of the earth itself.    It's recommended to leave about 1 inch (2 cm.) empty space surrounding the perimeter of the fort...."}

If this does not work then try stronger formulas available at drug stores. You could also use a commercial product designed especially for treating hyperhidrosis. These products contain higher concentrations of active ingredient than regular deodorants do. They usually come in roll-on form so they don't get into eyes when applied. Antiperspirants stop perspiration while deodorants mask odor caused by sweat. Some people find it difficult to apply antiperspirants correctly due to sensitivity issues associated with application site irritation and\/or rashes. In order to avoid this problem follow the instructions below:   Apply antiperspirant after washing your arms thoroughly. Dry them completely afterwards. Do NOT apply any lotion prior to putting on antiperspirant. The combination of soap residue and lotion causes clogging up pores leading to increased sweating. Wait until your skin has dried out completely before applying antiperspirant. Make sure there isn't anything else on your arm - no jewelries, watches, bracelets, rings etc.. Remove all traces of makeup from your face since certain cosmetics might interfere with proper absorption of antiperspirant causing more sweating. Don't forget to wash your hands!

Stock \u2013 Choose a thin strip of wood around 3\/4\" wide x 1\" thick which fits snugly inside the body of the blank but doesn't interfere with its movement while firing. (Note: For most people who don't plan on shooting their pistols very often, it's best to use balsa wood.)     It would probably take several hours to complete each part of the process described below depending upon your skill level and the size of the gun you choose to build.  \n\nIf you'd rather purchase a ready-made kit instead of building yours yourself, there are many options available online including kits designed specifically for beginners. \n\nBefore beginning construction, you'll first need to decide what kind of design you wish to incorporate into your own custom-built replica.  There are countless variations possible based solely on personal preference, but here are just a few ideas to get started:"}

In general terms, there are two main types of publishers: traditional publishers and self-publishers.  Traditional publishers take care of all aspects involved in putting a book onto shelves; they handle editing, design, layout, distribution, advertising, etc..  They also pay royalties based off of sales figures rather than flat fees per book published.  On the other hand, self-publishers do not usually provide any services beyond formatting their clients' manuscripts according to industry standards before sending them over to a professional editor and\/or designer.  The majority of self-published titles end up being sold through online retail outlets such as Amazon's KDP program instead of brick-and-mortar stores.  However, it should be noted that many successful writers began their career as self-publishers before moving on to more mainstream avenues of publication later down the road.  For example,..."}
{"text":"Welding can be done using many different methods but one method which works well on thin sheet metals such as those used in making trailers or other vehicles are called \"buzz boxes\".  Buzz boxes work very similar to stick welder's except they don't require you to hold onto the end of the wire while it melts.   This makes buzz boxes ideal if you're working alone since there will always be someone watching over you during this process.    Before we start, let's get some background information about how these things actually happen so you'll know why they're important before getting started.     First off, most people who do any kind of welding understand that heat must be generated from somewhere else than where we're going to make our weld.   Heat comes from electricity flowing through wires known as \"electrodes\"  These electrodes come in various shapes depending upon their intended purpose; however, all electrodes need to conduct current efficiently without burning out too quickly.        Electrodes also vary greatly based upon the material being welded; therefore, it's imperative..."}

Continue reading \u2192\n\nThe best way to start gathering firewood would probably be by using sticks found near your campsite.  These could include branches broken during storms or fallen trees lying nearby.  However, once you begin looking for them carefully, you'll notice there aren't many available close enough to your location so you'll eventually have to travel further afield to gather bigger logs.     Start collecting smaller pieces like twigs and leaves when possible because they'll burn faster than thicker logs.  You'll also want to look for dead branches hanging low over the forest floor since these won't take long to ignite.      When searching for big logs try to spot ones that appear rotten inside rather than just externally.  Rotten wood burns much better than sound wood does.        Always keep one hand firmly gripped onto whatever piece of wood you're carrying while walking through dense brushes such as brambles or nettles.  They'll sting badly even after being cut down!  It's important to remember that every bit counts here \u2013 don't waste time trying to collect too much fuel unless absolutely necessary.       In order to light fires efficiently you'll need to create tinder bundles made primarily from dried moss and\/or grass.  Collecting tinder isn't difficult though it takes patience and care.  Simply lay strips of dampened moss across a flat surface and allow sunlight to evaporate away its moisture.  Then roll the strip tightly between two fingers creating a ball-like shape.  Repeat this process several times until you end up with a bundle roughly the size of your fist.  Finally wrap the entire thing loosely in another layer of moistened moss to protect it from drying out completely.  Tinder balls must be kept cool whenever possible otherwise their flammability decreases significantly...."}
{"text":"Hooks: Hooks come in all sorts of sizes, colors, and designs.  The most important thing is that they should be strong enough to hold whatever you're trying to catch.   There are two main categories of hooks:  Single-hooks: These hooks usually feature one barb on each side (though some may only have 1 barbed end).  They tend to work best for smaller fish like trout, bass, perch, crappie, bluegill, pike-perch, walleye, salmon, catfish, etc.    Double-hooks: These hooks typically feature 2 barbs on either... Hook sizes: When choosing which size hook you'll use, it's helpful to know what kind of fish you'd like to catch.  For example, smallmouth bass prefer larger minnow-type baits so they'll take bigger hooks than those used by panfish such as largemouth bass, sunfish, crappies, bluegills, and muskellunge who will eat much smaller baits.     Size 1: This refers to the largest possible hook diameter allowed by law; these hooks are generally too large to effectively catch anything but very large game fish.      Size 2: These hooks measure about .5 inches across at their widest point.        Size 3: These hooks measure around .4 inches across at their widests.        Size 4: These hooks measure around .35 inches across at their widets.        Size 5: These hooks measure around .3 inches acros"}
{"text":"Pothos are easy plants for beginners because they can be propagated from stem-cuttings.  You may also find them called Devil's Ivy (Epipremnum aureum), Golden Bar Room (Epipremnum pinnatum) or Money Tree Plant (Epipremnum fortunei).  This method works best on young vines; older ones tend to have thicker stems making propagation more difficult.   If you're using this technique as part of a decorative display inside your home, choose a leafless stem so it's easier to work with.     Choose a stem that looks strong enough to support itself once planted.    The ideal length should be between 12-24 inches (30-60 cm).     Check each leaf along the stem carefully - any damaged areas indicate disease could spread easily during growth.  Don't use branches that look like they've been attacked by insects such as aphids or mealybugs.        To prevent rottenness after being removed from their parent plant, wash all tools used before proceeding further."}

For example, let's say we wanted our border to run 3 feet wide across 4 foot high ceilings. We'd multiply those numbers together to find 12 square feet total surface area we'd need to cover. Then divide that number by 36 squares per sheet of wallpaper = 0.33 sheets needed. (0.33 x 1 = .33). So we'll purchase three sheets of wallpaper at $9.99\/each=$27.97 + shipping costs."}

Choose herbs grown organically whenever possible because they won't have been treated with pesticides which could be harmful to humans and\/or pets.    In addition, avoid picking plants near roadsides since they tend to accumulate more pollution than other areas.      When you're done collecting samples, bring all six specimens back indoors and wash them thoroughly under running tap water before placing them in separate bowls filled with fresh water.    After about 24 hours, check whether they're still alive - if not discard them immediately.        Now it's time to prepare the bottle itself!     Start by cutting away the neck portion of the bottle leaving only the body intact.    Next cut along both sides of the bottle's mouth creating two equal halves.    Carefully peel apart the halves revealing the interior cavity of the bottle.    Rinse the entire inner surface of the bottle with warm water followed by cold water.    Dry completely with a soft cotton rag.    It's important to rinse the bottle well after cleaning otherwise mold growth may occur later during the process of turning the bottle into a garden container.    A good idea here is to fill halfway with sandy loam mixed with composted manure and then add enough potting mix to cover the rest of the space within the bottle.    Finally, pour water through the bottle to help settle everything together.    Insert the drainage tube into the hole created earlier in step 3 above.    Be careful not to damage the tube while doing this; however, do not worry too much about damaging it; you'll replace it once again shortly afterwards.    Let the mixture dry overnight.    Cover the bottle tightly with plastic wrap.    Leave the bottle sealed for 2-3 weeks.    During this period, keep checking every few days to see if there's any moisture leaking out of the bottle.    Do this by gently tapping the side of the bottle against a tabletop.    If no leaks are detected, uncover the bottle and let sit open air-drying for another week.    At the end of the second week, carefully remove the tape covering the bottle and inspect the contents.    If necessary, repeat steps 4-7 until the bottle has dried fully.    Continue adding layers of gravel, pebbles, stones, moss, bark chips, etc."}

Never leave cooked beef outside of these temperature ranges without freezing first.  Cooked beef left above 60\u00baC\/140\u00baF has increased risk of bacterial contamination which could cause illnesses including E. coli O157:H7 infection.

{"text":"In order for you to understand how much importance Americans place upon the Bible today,  I will show you some facts about America's most important book.  The Bible was officially endorsed by our founding fathers when they were writing the Constitution.   In Article VI Section 3  It states \"No religious test shall ever be required... None can take office or hold any position of trust or profit under government if he refuses to acknowledge God Almighty....\"   This means no person may become President unless he believes in Jehovah God! ... None can serve in the military without believing in Jesus Christ!  No person can vote for anyone else but those who believe in Jehovah God!\nIt should come as no surprise then why the Bible is so revered among all true Christians around the world.    Now let us look into another interesting aspect of the Bible..  During the Revolutionary war many people fled across the Atlantic Ocean seeking refuge in Britain because King George III had declared war against them..    Many families left behind loved ones hoping these would survive the horrific battlefields of Europe where thousands died every day fighting for freedom,..."}

You may also choose to sell the baby shrimp instead; however this could lead to problems because many people are unaware how dangerous these creatures really are when they're babies!   The following steps should help get you started.    Make sure there isn't anything else living inside before introducing the shrimp into their new home!  It would probably be best... To start off, you'll need one 55 gallon aquarium per 100 adult shrimp you'd like to keep.  A smaller tank works too - just make sure it's big enough to house several pairs of adults together without crowding.

The blades available range from thin metal-cutting blades up to thick wood-cutting blades.    A jigsaw has many advantages over other types of saws such as:  It allows you to cut curves accurately.     You don't have to hold the entire length of the material while making a cut.     There isn't much waste left behind after completing a cut.     However there are some disadvantages too:     It's difficult to control how far the blade travels during each stroke so it's easy to accidentally go beyond what you're trying to cut.     Sawing creates dust particles which can get everywhere.     Cutting depth cannot exceed the thickness of one blade tooth.     This means that only very shallow cuts (less than 1mm) can be made using a jigsaw.     For these reasons, jigsaws should not normally be used for:   Making deep cuts.

Now it's time to create the actual feeders themselves!  First take apart any existing PVC elbows and straight connectors you'd like to use.  Then remove the ends of both pieces of PVC tubing.  You'll notice small metal rings attached to either side of the tube near its base.  These are called flanges and serve as attachment points for connecting the tubes together.  Remove those before continuing.      Take note of which way the flange faces - clockwise or counterclockwise.  If they're facing opposite directions, flip one over 180 degrees so they'll face the same direction.  Flip the other piece of PVC tubing over so that the flanges line up perfectly.  Press firmly onto the flanges while holding the PVC tubing steady against the tabletop.  Rotate the PVC tubing slowly back-and-forth several times until the connection feels tight enough to hold itself securely.

You may find some useful information about how these experiments work by reading our articles related to each one.    Crystal Growth Experiment  In this experiment we show how different types of solutions affect the growth rate of crystals made up of sodium chloride dissolved in water.  This experiment requires only two simple supplies - salt and water.  We use table salt because it's cheap but any type of salt would do.  If you're interested in growing bigger crystals try adding borax instead of salt.  Borax helps produce larger crystals faster.  Crystals grown without borax tend to form small clusters rather than single large ones.

{"text":"The placenta will be delivered shortly following birth.  The umbilical cord connects the mother to her child through the placenta during pregnancy.   After delivery, the umbilical cord should be cut so that the infant no longer receives nutrients via this connection.    Clamping refers to pinching the umbilical cord tightly near its base where it attaches to the placenta.  This cuts off circulation to the fetus\u2019 circulatory system.  It also stops the flow of oxygen-rich blood into the fetal heart.  Once the cord has been clamped, the baby begins breathing independently without assistance from the placenta.  There are two types of clamping:  Immediate clamping occurs immediately upon delivery when the baby's feet touch the ground.  Delayed... Continue reading\n\nDelayed clamping allows more time for the baby to receive some of these important nutrients while they\u2019re still attached to their mother.  In fact, studies show babies who received delayed clamping had higher levels of iron stores than those whose cords were clamped early.  They also experienced less respiratory distress syndrome later in infancy.  However, immediate clamping does offer several advantages over delayed clamping including faster placental separation and reduced risk of infection.  Some doctors recommend delaying clamping until 30 seconds after delivery because there is evidence showing that doing so reduces the likelihood of developing jaundice.  Other experts believe waiting up to three minutes gives the best results.  Your doctor might advise one method instead of another based on his\/her experience and\/or research findings.

This guide assumes that you already know how to use a knife (or other cutting tool), hammer\/axe\/sledgehammer, sawing machine, screwdriver, pliers\/handcuffs, flashlight batteries\/cordless drill\/motorized sander.   You can also find detailed information regarding building shelters here.    The most important thing before starting this project is to think carefully about where exactly do you want to put your shelter? Do not forget that you need enough light coming through windows and\/or skylights; otherwise you'll feel claustrophobic very quickly!   If you're planning to live underground all year round then it's best to choose somewhere warm like Arizona instead of Alaska - even though both places might seem equally cold outside.     Think... How much money would you spend on such a shelter?\nWhat materials should I buy first?  What does my family eat regularly?\n\nDo we have enough food storage containers?\nWhere could I store extra supplies safely?"}

{"text":"Integrals are used extensively throughout mathematics.  They can be found in physics (e.g., work), engineering (e.g., electrical circuits), economics (e.g., production costs), chemistry (e.g., molecular orbital theory), biology (e.g., population growth models).  In fact, they appear so frequently that it is impossible to list all applications here.   The purpose of this section will not only teach you how to calculate definite integrals but also introduce some techniques useful for finding their values.    This includes understanding what integrates means as well as knowing where to use them.... \nThe first thing you'll need to know about integrating is its meaning..  Integration simply refers to adding up or combining several things together into one larger whole..    For example, if we have two apples and three bananas then our total number of fruits would equal five...but there were no pears involved!   If instead we had four apples,... None of these examples involve any actual addition; however, that's exactly what's happening during integration!  Instead we're taking multiple pieces of information from different areas and putting them altogether into something more complex.  We call this process \"adding\" because it's similar to adding fractions - both require us to combine smaller numbers into bigger ones.  Let's look at another example:  Imagine you're trying to figure out your monthly income after taxes.  You start off by calculating your salary before taxes: $1000 per month plus $50 bonus each quarter equals $1200 per month without taxes.  Then add in $100 deductions every other week which totals $300 per month.  Finally, subtract $20 in federal taxes and $10 in state taxes giving you a grand total of $900 per month after taxes.  Now imagine doing this calculation using just one number: $1250$"}

{"text":"The most important thing when choosing an appropriate matting material is its size.  The dimensions should match those of the picture exactly.   If you're not certain about how large your image needs to be framed, use one of our free online tools at www.wikihow.com\/Frame-a-Picture-to-Find-the-Sizes-You-Need  You can also find these tools by clicking here.    Once you've found out what sizes you'll need, it's time to get started!   Here are some things you'll want to keep in mind while working with this project:    1) Make sure whatever surface you choose has enough space to lay down your mat without being folded over itself.     2) Lay your mat flat so that both ends meet up perfectly (i.e. no creases).     3) Measure carefully before beginning - don't make mistakes!  4) Be aware that if you do end... Continue reading \u2192\n\nOnce you've measured everything correctly, place your mat onto the table where you plan to work.  Then begin tracing around each edge of the mat with a sharpie pen.  This way, once you start cutting, you won't accidentally slice off too much paper along the edges.  Remember to leave room for the glue line which runs across the middle of the mat.  It may help to draw another outline inside the original one just to ensure accuracy.  Don't worry; even though we call them \"edges\" they aren't actually straight like you'd expect.  In fact, they're often curved slightly towards the center of the mat.  So try to follow their natural shape instead of trying to force yourself to create straight cuts.  For example, let's say we're creating a 12x18 inch mat.  We would trace the outer edges of the mat starting at 6 inches away from either end...."}

It may seem like an intimidating task now, but you'll be able to beat him once you know what he's doing!\nThe first thing I would recommend before starting off against Sephiroth is getting some experience points from other battles beforehand. You'll need them later on during battle since it's impossible to gain experience while fighting Sephiroth himself; he'll always take away half of yours no matter how well you perform. So make sure you fight lots of enemies until you reach level 99+. Also equip everything that's available to you such as elixirs, high-potions etc.. Make sure you also have plenty of HP potions too -- you'll definitely want those handy throughout the entire battle. Now here's another important tip: Don't forget to save often!! It's highly recommended that you save every few minutes especially near the end part of the game."}

If you've already tried potty training but failed (or if it's been years since), read How To Start Over After A Failed Attempt At Potty Training first before continuing.    Knowing whether your toddler has reached the age where he or she would benefit from being trained to use the bathroom independently depends largely upon each individual child\u2019s development level.

Others say not to worry too much about timing\u2014just wait until they're physically able to control their bowels and bladder.... In general, girls tend to develop earlier than boys do.  Girls usually begin showing signs between 21-24 months old, whereas boys may show no interest whatsoever until closer to 30 months old.  This does NOT mean that all boys won't ever want to try potty training!  Many boys simply need more encouragement and\/or motivation because they often find it embarrassing to talk openly about needing to urinate or defecate.  They also prefer privacy over publicity.  Boys generally learn faster once they've started doing it themselves.  Once again, there isn't any hard-and-fast rule here either.  Every child develops differently.  You just need to pay attention to your own child's behavior and see what's normal for him\/her.  For example, if your son seems interested in wearing his mother's panties, then he's probably ready to start potty training.  He might even ask to wear them himself.  Or maybe he'll suddenly become very excited whenever someone mentions the word \"potty\"; perhaps s\/he'll even point to her\/his diaper and tell you that she's done pooping or peeing.

If you're raising dairy cows, you'll want to know their milk yield potential before purchasing them so... You may find yourself buying grain because it's cheap; however, this could lead to problems down the road such as:  Poor-quality grains often contain high amounts of mycotoxins which cause illnesses like liver disease, diarrhea, reduced growth rates, decreased reproduction efficiency, increased susceptibility to diseases including mastitis, lameness, pneumonia, abortion, stillbirth, infertility, and death.  These toxins accumulate overtime causing damage to organs and tissues throughout the entire body.  Mycotoxin contamination occurs during storage due to improper drying techniques and\/or inadequate ventilation systems resulting in moldy corn silages, haylage, straw bales, and dried distillers grains.  When these products are fed to ruminant animals, ingestion leads to accumulation of toxic metabolites called aflatoxins in meat, milk, eggs, hair follicles, urine, and manure.  Milk contaminated with aflatoxin has been linked to infant deaths caused by acute hepatic necrosis leading to cirrhosis of the liver.  Aflatoxin-contaminated foods pose serious health risks to humans consuming those foods since aflatoxins are carcinogenic compounds capable of inducing cancerous tumors in various parts of the human body.  There are several types of molds found in stored grains, some produce no visible signs while others grow into large colonies producing spores that spread rapidly through air currents contaminating nearby areas.  Some common species include Aspergillus flavus, Fusarium verticillioides, Penicilium vermiculatum, Alternaria alternata, Cladosporium herbarum, Stachybotrys chartarum, Chaetomium globosum, Curvularia lunata, Drechslera sorokinianii, Epicoccum nigrum, Eurotium repens, Fomes fomentarius, Geotricum candidum, Paecilomyces varioti, Phoma glomerata, Rhizopus stolonifer, Trichoderma viride, Ulocladium botrytis, Ustilago maydis, Wallemia sebi, Wickerhamomyces anomalus, Zygophiala jamaicensis,  Other contaminants include:  High moisture contents - Moisture causes spoilage and increases the risk of bacterial infection.

But there are plenty of other factors which contribute towards creating a truly great song.\n\n1) Great Melody\n\nA great melody should stick in your mind long after hearing it; something that's impossible to forget once heard....and equally difficult to sing along without humming yourself.  It doesn't necessarily need to follow traditional rules such as having three distinct sections (verse\/chorus\/bridge).  In fact, sometimes breaking those conventions works well too.  For example, try listening to:  \n\n2) Memorable Hook"}

This recipe will show you exactly what needs to be done so that you too are able to enjoy these delicious treats!\nThe first step towards preparing stuffed chicken breasts starts by buying some quality meat.   You should look for thicker pieces of boneless, skinless white or dark meat from organic chickens raised without antibiotics.    The next thing you need to do is lay out two large sheets of plastic wrap over each other on an even surface such as a countertop.     Place both halves of the chicken breast between them and then gently press down until they flatten slightly.    If you're not sure whether you've pressed enough, try lifting up the edges of the plastic wrap to see if they're still sticking to the chicken breast.  Then remove the plastic wrap carefully and set aside.      Next take a sharp knife and slice straight through the center of... Continue reading...\nOnce you've made all four cuts, expand the openings using your hands.  Once again, don't worry if there isn't much room inside; just keep pushing outward until there's plenty of space available.    Now it's time to prepare the stuffing!  For example, if you'd like to create a simple but tasty chicken kiev, simply combine 1\/2 cup shredded Parmesan cheese along with 1\/4 teaspoon salt and 1\/8 teaspoon black pepper in a small bowl.    Mix well until everything has combined evenly.    Add 1 tablespoon chopped parsley leaves and stir once more.    Pour half of the mixture onto the bottom of each chicken breast cavity and spread around evenly.    Top off each chicken breast with another spoonful of mozzarella cheese and place back under the broiler for 5 additional minutes.    Remove from heat when the tops begin to brown lightly.

For example,  to unlock Andy Summers\u2019 version of Crossy Road,   you'll first have to beat your highscore using the Mallard,    which happens to be Andy's favorite character.     Similarly,  to unlock Matt Hall\u2019s version of Crossy Road,    you'll first have to beat either your highscore    or obtain a \"Great\" score playing as the Mallard.    As another example,    to unlock Ben Weatherall\u2019s version of Crossy Roads,    simply beat your highscore using \"Dark Lord\".    Note:     Some of these developers have more than one easter egg included in their version of Crossy Roads;    however,    only one of those easter eggs requires beating your highscore.    So,    even though you might think you've found both of Ben Weatherall's easter eggs,    just remember that there's still one more waiting for you!  Also note that:     These easter eggs aren't available yet on iOS devices.    However,    it's possible they'll become available soon enough.

Maybe it's just plain hard being single right now -- especially if most of your close friends are dating each other! Whatever the reason(s), know this: Feeling lonely isn't necessarily a bad thing. In fact, research shows that experiencing feelings of loneliness every once in a while actually helps us grow emotionally stronger!  So what should you do instead? Well, start by taking stock of where exactly things stand between yourself and others. Ask yourself questions like:   What am I doing that's keeping me from connecting more deeply with my loved ones?  Am I putting too much pressure on myself to keep up appearances? Is there anything I'm unwilling to share with those closest to me? Are there certain aspects of my personality that scare or intimidate potential friends?

To do this:  Find a large black sweatshurt that fits well.     Remove the arms from one end of the garment.     Pull apart the seams along each armhole.     Repeat these steps for both sides of the garment.     Once you've removed the arms you'll need to sew new ones in:     Sew two long pieces of cord together.     Thread the cords through the newly created armholes.     Tie knots securely at either end of the cord.     Trim excess cord if necessary.     Turn coat right-side-out.     Try on the completed vest.       Next we'll create straps made entirely of duct tape which run across the back of the vest.        Start by applying duct tape to the inside surface of the vest along its top edge.      Apply enough duct tape to cover about halfway up the torso of the person who'll be wearing the vest.         Continue adding layers of duct tape until you're satisfied with the amount of coverage provided by the strap.

If you're interested in becoming a clinical scientist,...

You'll usually begin earning credits during your junior and\/or senior year of high school so that when you go on to attend university you've already completed enough credit hours to qualify for admission into most majors offered there.  You should aim to obtain between 30 and 36 semester units while attending community college before transferring those credits over to any major you'd like to pursue at a 4-year institution.  This way it won't take too long to finish your first two years of college studies once you enroll full time at a 4-year university.     Some students decide not to transfer all of these credits because they want to focus more heavily on certain subjects than others throughout their entire academic careers.  For example, someone might only wish to concentrate on math courses rather than English ones.  In addition, it's possible to get accepted directly into a master's program without having obtained a bachelor's degree beforehand.

{"text":"Inflation: What Is It?\nWhat Does It Mean To You? How Can You Protect Yourself From Its Effects? \n \n In this video tutorial, learn about what inflation means. \n \n \n \n Watch Video: \n \n Learn More About This Topic: \n\n\n...and now let's look at the effects of inflation! First off, watch your home value: if you're lucky enough to own one, you'll probably notice its value starting to slide down. (Deflation.) If not, work on finding ways to reduce costs when it comes to household and business utilities--as the providers \"pass-through\" the cost of inflation onto consumers via higher utility bills. Next up, define deflation: the lowering of dollar values. Then take note of your best ways to cut down on fuel consumption, become more efficient, and find cheaper sources of fuel like gasoline, oil, and natural gas. Finally, examine inflation that's partially brought upon us thanks to our country's central banking system--the US Federal Reserve Bank prints \"excessive\" amounts of currency so they can lend it to weaker banks encouraging them to expand their lending practices to businesses and individuals alike--and also due to the government's need to print extra money to cover budget shortfalls during recessions. So try to stay employed: perhaps relocate or switch fields entirely. And keep improving your marketable skills: unused knowledge is just wasted potential. Remember that an unstable economy somewhere will affect others worldwide. Take note: state and local governments are already close to bankruptcy; they're relying heavily on federal funds to survive, and the feds themselves are struggling financially after bailing out too-big-to-fail banks and Wall Street firms last year. Now consider investing: gold and government-guaranteed securities might make sense right now since both currencies\u2014the American dollar and the euro\u2014are relatively weak compared to previous years. But don't forget that inflation has been known to spike dramatically over time, causing boom-and-bust cycles typical of any recessionary period."}

This article will provide information about treating and preventing nitrate toxicity in cattle caused by consuming contaminated feed and\/or drinking polluted water sources containing excessive concentrations of nitrates.  It also provides some general guidelines regarding managing pastures and rangelands to reduce the likelihood of nitrate contamination.... \nThe following table lists common plant species known to contain relatively high levels of nitrates per unit weight compared to many others.  These values represent typical ranges observed across different growing regions around the world.  However,...   Plants grown under stressful environments tend to produce more nitrates than those grown in ideal circumstances.  For example, drought-stressed grasses often yield up to three times greater concentration of nitrates than their normal counterparts.  Similarly, legumes subjected to heat stresses typically exhibit increased nitrate contents relative to cooler temperatures.  Aside from temperature extremes, light intensity has been shown to play an important role in influencing nitrate formation in plants.  High-light intensities increase photosynthetic rates resulting in elevated nitrate levels while shading reduces them significantly.  Light intensity effects appear to vary among species but generally speaking, shade-tolerant species seem less prone to producing high levels of nitrates than sun-loving ones do. ..."}

See How To Handle A Child Who Is Gossipping For more information. The following steps may be helpful whether you've just found out there's an issue going on between two friends...or even if it's something that's been bothering you for months!   1. Check and cross check your stories Before taking action against anyone who's being mean towards you,... keep track of everything they say\/do so you'll know exactly what's happened....and make sure they're telling the truth!  2. Keep gossiping to...a minimum. It's easy to get sucked into the drama surrounding backstabbing; but try to stay focused only on the facts - don't add colorful details from hearsay sources.   3. Build good relationships with everyone Around you. You can't expect to solve every problem by removing one source of conflict. In fact, sometimes having multiple perspectives can actually lead to better solutions than you'd find otherwise. 4. Learn to spot the signs As soon as possible. Sometimes we need time to realize we're being lied to or manipulated. But once you do notice these things happening, take immediate measures to stop them. 5. Understand That Not All Irritating Behavior Is A Sign Of Backstabbing. Some people simply aren't very nice to each other. And some people's annoying habits might stem from their own insecurities rather than malicious intent. 6. Keep Records Of What Goes On. Write down dates, times, places, names, and descriptions of events whenever there seems to be trouble brewing. 7. Identify The Backstabber(s). Once you start keeping detailed notes, it'll be easier to figure out which individuals are causing most of the tension. 8. Confide In A Friend About Your Suspicions. Even though you should always trust your instincts first, it's important to talk through"}

Why should I want to be saved?\nWhat Does Being \"Saved\" Mean?\n\nBeing \"saved\" means having been rescued out of our relationship with Satan (the Devil) into one with God.   In order to understand why people need saving it's important first to realize who they were before they came to believe in Jesus.    Before coming to faith most Christians had lived lives full of selfishness, pridefulness, lusts, greediness etc...

As the gas continues building up, however, the abdominal wall becomes tense and hardened leading to extreme discomfort and even respiratory distress.

The act of blocking a shot may result in a personal foul called by referees.   A blocked shot results in possession being awarded back to the offense.

{"text":"Human beings have evolved over millions of years, during which time their bodies have changed dramatically.  In order to survive these changes our bodies had to adapt accordingly.   One way we adapted was through evolution;  mutations occurred within genes coding proteins involved in metabolic processes (such as digestion) allowing us to better digest food sources available at different times throughout history.    Another adaptation process has been through natural selection where organisms best suited to their environment survived while those less fit died off.     As a result of both evolutionary mechanisms there were dramatic changes in how our ancestors looked like compared... [Read more] .     Today's modern man looks quite different than his ancient counterparts who lived thousands of years ago.  For example, man's brain increased significantly in size; it now represents about 2% of total body weight whereas only 0.5% represented in early hominids.  Similarly, muscles became larger representing up to 40% of total body mass today versus 20% in earlier species.  These increases allowed men to walk upright, use tools, hunt large prey, run faster etc..    Humans' ability to think abstractly gave rise to language development and communication skills enabling people to work together towards common goals.  All these developments required significant increase in energy consumption leading to further modifications in metabolism resulting in higher levels of oxygen utilization per unit of muscle activity.        During the course of evolution some organs disappeared completely due to lack of needs; others underwent major structural reorganizations.

Is his chest full?  Does she seem well-muscled throughout her entire frame?  If yes, then you've got yourself a winner!    - What shape appears to best describe the animal's backside?  Do we see a rounder bottom here than there?  Are those tails hanging low enough?  These questions all play a role in determining whether you're dealing with a quality animal or one who may need some work done if he's going to make it onto any sort of show ring!  - Finally, it's time to examine the neck area.  Look carefully here:  Is the throat cleanly cut off?  No matter which way you turn around, doesn't the neck look strong yet elegant?  Don't forget to check out the shoulders themselves; they're another key component of both male and female bovines alike.  They'll tell us everything we've been waiting for:  Are they sloped forward towards the ground?  Or perhaps more importantly, are they angled backwards away from the ground?  And finally, don't neglect the heart girth itself.  It's easy to overlook something as simple as this; however, it's actually extremely significant.  It tells us exactly how large our animal is:  Isn't that right, Mr. Big-Bodied-Horse-With-A-Large-Cupped-Eye?  Well now imagine having a similar feature on a cow that's twice the size of yours...."}

The advantage over other methods are its low cost (less than $10) and ease in making.

If you've never made one yourself then you'll probably find these useful tips helpful when creating yours.     Measurements - Before we begin drawing our template we'll first measure how much space there is between the lens mount and the front element of the lens so that we know exactly what dimensions we're working within.      A ruler should do fine here; however it's best to have something more accurate like a measuring tape available since most lenses aren't perfectly round.       ...    Template Drawing - Once we've measured up all four corners of the lens mounting hole, let's now turn those numbers into actual lines by tracing each corner onto a piece of paper.       We don't actually need to trace every single millimeter along the edge of the circle because that's going to get cut away anyway during construction, but having a rough idea about the overall proportions helps us plan ahead better later on.         For example, if the distance between two points was 12mm apart we'd roughly expect their corresponding edges to be separated by 6mm once they're drawn on the paper.        It doesn't matter which way the lines go either \u2013\u00a0we'll flip everything horizontally afterward...."}

The following sections outline some common types of benefits offered by employers around the world.\n\nHealth Insurance\n\nMany countries require employees to contribute towards their own medical costs through premiums deducted from wages before taxes are applied.  In addition, many employers also contribute funds towards these costs either directly outright payment or indirectly via group insurance policies.

Many governments subsidize pensions so that people do not need to save large amounts themselves; however, even without government subsidies, saving enough throughout one's working life to support oneself after retirement requires significant effort.  \n\nWorkers often choose between defined-benefit and defined-contribution pension systems.  Defined-benefit pension schemes guarantee a certain level of monthly payments regardless of investment returns earned by the plan's assets...."}

The sun sets behind the tree so its light shines through the bare branches creating dramatic shadows.    You can use any size canvas; however this tutorial uses a 12\" square canvas which makes framing easier.     Begin by cutting a 6\"x9\" piece of 140# cold-press watercolor paper.  Place the paper on a piece of heavy cardboard or foamboard larger then the paper itself (but not mounted).  Using a ruler draw a vertical line 2inches above where you'd like the top edge of the tree to be.  On either end of the line sketch in circles representing the horizon lines.  These should be about 1inch across.  Sketch in another circle just below these first ones indicating ground level.  Now start drawing the outline of the tree.

Here are some things you'll want to consider before signing up for an apartment.   If possible, visit several potential places so you can compare them side-by-side.    Make sure there's ample closet space available as well as plenty of light from natural sources such as sunlight coming through large windows.     You may also wish to look out onto something beautiful - trees, flowers, waterfalls... whatever makes you feel happy!     The kitchen should include everything necessary for preparing meals including refrigerator, stove, microwave oven,...   There must be adequate bathroom space; this includes shower stalls, bathtubs and\/or sinks....    It's best not to choose an apartment too far away from school because then you'd need transportation which could add additional costs to your budget.    Also try to find an apartment where you won't be walking down dark alleys alone late at night.    Try to avoid choosing an apartment located next door to noisy bars or clubs since these establishments tend to attract rowdy crowds who might disturb your sleep patterns.    Don't forget to ask whether smoking is permitted inside the apartment complex.    Some colleges require their students to live within certain distance limits from the main campus but others don't specify anything regarding location restrictions.    Be aware that most universities do allow their students to live outside those specified areas provided they meet specific requirements set forth by each university's housing office.    In addition, some schools offer financial assistance towards paying rent while others provide free dormitory rooms for first-year students only.    Before making final decision, check with your college's housing department to determine exactly what's required of you when it comes to finding suitable accommodations.    For example, if your college offers subsidized housing options, you would probably qualify for similar benefits offered by local government agencies under HUD program known as Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Programs...."}

Choose something large enough so...that there is ample space between individual plants when grown fully....and small enough so...the roots have sufficient air circulation around themselves. ...to allow easy access while caring for your plants,...but also big enough to prevent overcrowding which could lead to disease among neighboring plants..

Some good choices include:   A wooden box (with drainage holes) An old window pane A terracotta pot Terracotta hanging basket A decorative stoneware pot A metal bucket A glass jar A plastic bottle ...or another material like wood or cork.  To make this easier place some pebbles or stones along the base of the container to help drain excess moisture away quickly after watering.  For example, a clay pot may take several hours longer than expected to dry completely compared to a plastic pot.  Also avoid placing your container directly against walls since these areas tend to retain heat making it difficult for the soil to cool off properly causing root rot problems.     In addition, try to find a spot far away from direct sun exposure because too much warmth causes rapid evaporation leading to drying up of the soil faster than normal resulting in wilting of the plants...."}

See more \u00bb\n\n\n\nThe following steps will help treat a closed fracture until professional medical attention arrives.\n\nStop Bleeding  Stopping blood flow immediately helps minimize damage to surrounding tissues and reduces the risk of infection.  To do so,  apply pressure directly above the wound using gauze pads or a clean piece of cloth.  Do NOT use butterfly bandages because they don't provide enough support.  You should also try to keep the victim calm since stress increases heart rate and causes blood vessels to constrict, thereby increasing blood flow.    Make sure all dressings stay dry before applying new ones.  Change the dressing every 15 minutes unless the bleeding has stopped completely.  In addition, make sure the patient doesn't get too cold.  Keep him\/her warm instead of cool.  Warmth promotes healing processes whereas cooling slows down these processes.  For example, wrap the patient's arm\/leg in a blanket or jacket once the bleeding stops.  Don't elevate the limb higher than the level of the heart.  Doing so could cause increased blood flow back into the damaged tissue causing additional trauma.  \n\nImmobilizing the Injury Preventing unnecessary motion of the injured area prevents further injury and allows time for proper treatment.  It does this by keeping the bones together and preventing their displacement.  Once again, immobilization depends upon what part of the body was injured.  However, some general guidelines include:   Avoid putting weight on the injured area.  Restrain the injured limbs gently yet firmly.  Support the injured area with pillows, towels, cushions, etc.  Secure splints or braces to stabilize the joint(s) near the injured area.  Cover the injured area with something soft and comfortable.  Never tape anything tightly across joints.  Tape only loosely along edges of splints\/braces.  Take extra precautions"}

However, if done correctly this type of critique helps artists improve their skills and become better painters themselves.    The following steps should help guide you:  Gather several pieces of artwork created recently (or at least within the last few months) by each member of your class.  Ask them not to show anyone else's painting until everyone has arrived so no one knows who painted which picture yet.  Arrange these works neatly side-by-side on an easel-like table before beginning the critiques.  Make sure there isn't too many pictures per person; three would probably be ideal.

Be sure there aren't any air bubbles trapped inside when doing this so that they don't pop while setting.     Setting time:   After about 30 minutes, remove the lid off of the container where you poured the mixture.  Check back every 15-30 minutes afterward to see whether it's set enough yet.  It'll take anywhere between 2-3 hours before it'll fully dry depending upon temperature and humidity levels outside.      Removing the molds:    When the mixture sets completely, carefully peel away each piece of cardboard from around the edges of the container.  Carefully lift the entire thing out by hand once all four sides are removed.        Finishing touches:     Now comes the fun part!  Take whatever item(s) you chose to fossilize and place them onto top of the dried-out mixture.  Cover these items entirely with petroleum jelly.  Then gently press down on the surface of the mixture with your fingers.  Do this slowly so that no air pockets get caught underneath.  Don't worry too much about making perfect impressions; they'll still look great even though they're slightly uneven!      For example,..."}

Get a dog. Dogs bark whenever something strange happens; they're great deterrents against burglars because they make noise and scare away potential thieves. (Plus dogs love people.) 3. Lock everything. This goes without saying, but it's worth repeating anyway. 4. Don't leave anything valuable lying around. Hide jewelry, electronics, etc. 5. Put up \"scare\" signs. These aren't necessarily going to keep burglars away, but they might discourage them enough to try somewhere else instead. 6. Avoid showing off too much money\/valuable possessions. Criminals often target houses where there's lots of cash and\/or fancy cars parked out; if you're living beyond your means, burglaries could become commonplace. 7. Be cautious when hiring contractors. Never hire any worker whose background checks come back negative. 8. Register your valuables. Most states require owners to report stolen property within 24 hours after discovering it; doing so makes it easier for authorities to track down stolen goods...."}

Mark the perimeter around the central stake with more stakes and string.   Make these marks visible throughout construction.  \n\nDigging the Hole\n\nUse shovels and\/or backhoes to excavate the entire area marked out earlier.   Be aware that depending on local regulations, you might require permits to dig holes larger than 3 feet across.   Check with your city hall\/county clerk office to see what's required locally.   Keep track of the depth of the hole while you work.   Once finished, fill the hole with clean sand until the desired height has been reached.   Then compact the sand thoroughly with a heavy roller.   Leave room between the edge of the hole and the surrounding landfill material for drainage purposes.   Remember - the deeper the hole, the better!  Water needs space to move freely within its container!\n\nPond Liner Installation\n\nBefore laying the liner itself, lay down plastic sheeting along the edges of the hole to prevent spillage during installation..   Lay the liner flat against the base of the hole and secure it tightly with landscape staples spaced every 12-18 inches apart.   Secure the corners of the liner with duct tape.   Cut away excess liner wherever necessary.   Do NOT cut the liner with scissors because jagged edges could tear open later on.

After 30 minutes, turn the stones 180 degrees so they'll be facing away from where the fire started.    Keep turning the stones every 10-20 minutes until they've reached peak temperature.

Bake at 350\u00b0F\/180\u00b0C for 10-12 mins.    Cool slightly before adding candy centers.     Refrigerate for 15-20 min.        Serve immediately!    Finished. Enjoy!

This wikiHow teaches you all kinds of ways to get her style into your own space.  Make sure you read through each step carefully before moving onto the next!  Remember - don't be afraid to experiment!\nStep 1: Start by painting\/wallpapering your room.   Pick out colors and\/or designs that are unique yet still fit together nicely.    Try using different textures too (like stripes); they add depth and interest to any room.  Paint or wallpaper only half of the wall(s), leaving an unpainted strip down the center.     For example, you could do blue stripes going vertically up both sides of the room, while keeping the ceiling and floor neutral grayish-greens.  Or go for something completely opposite -- such as yellowy-yellows against dark brown wood floors and ceilings....   Step 2: Place your bed in the middle between two painted\/wallpapered walls. (You should leave at least 3 feet [91 cm] around the edges of the bed free.)     Choose a comforter set that's brightly-colored and has lots of texture--such as plaid, polka dots, etc.        Add some throw blankets over top of the sheets and duvet cover to give your bed extra warmth and comfort.      Consider getting a new mattress pad made especially for kids."}

This guide provides basic information about how to operate one safely while producing useful items such as bowls, spoons, pens, candles holders etc.. The following steps assume some knowledge of woodworking techniques already exists.    Safety first!   Always wear goggles, ear protection, leather gloves, long sleeves and pants whenever operating any power equipment like lathes.     Never attempt to adjust anything inside the spindle housing unless all power has been turned off and the lathe is unplugged.     If there... is no dust cover over the motor pulley,... continue reading below ...    To start learning how to use a wood lathe,  select a small diameter wooden dowel rod or stick, preferably less than 1 inch (2 cm).     Place the rod against the tailstock stop screw, and tighten until it's securely held in place.    Set up the lathe according to manufacturer specifications,    usually involving adjusting the height of the headstock spur gear relative to the main shaft.    Start the lathe spinning freely by pulling down gently on the handle attached to the belt drive system.    Once you've got things running smoothly,   set the depth gauge dial to zero.    Insert the tip of the pencil point style depth gauge into the hole provided near the top of the spindle.    Adjust the depth gauge knob until the pointer reads \"0\".    Then move the depth gauge out slightly towards the front of the lathe.    You should now be able to see through the sighting slot located above the spindle.    Move the depth gauge further forward again until the pointer reaches \"1\".    Now insert the tip of the depth gauge into the hole next to \"2\".    Repeat these adjustments until you're satisfied with the accuracy of the scale.    When everything looks good, replace the depth gauge cap.

When you're ready to use the carrier again, give your cat another treat and praise them profusely whenever they step inside without hesitation.

{"text":"This is how I built my first winter shelter when I was living off grid.  It has been standing strong through several winters now.   The most important thing here isn't necessarily what type or size of wood you're using - it's just finding something sturdy enough so that no matter which way the wind blows, it'll hold up.    You don't even really need any tools except maybe some kindling if you can't get firewood right away.     This method will work best during cold weather because you'll be able to keep warm inside by burning logs outside before putting them into the hole you've dug out.  But this technique works well year round too!   For example, if you'd like to build a 3 x 4 ft. (1x1 m)  square tent-like structure,  dig a 6x8ft  (2x2 m) deep hole instead.

Continue reading\n\nThe first step when hunting whitetail deer is to find one that's been wounded but hasn't died yet.  If you're unsure whether the deer has been hit hard enough to kill it immediately, look for signs like blood on the ground where the animal was standing; if there isn't much blood visible, chances are good that the deer survived the initial impact.  You should also be able to see evidence of injury, including broken branches and other debris scattered about the scene.  In addition, check nearby trees for scratches made by claws trying to escape their prey.  Finally, listen carefully for sounds indicating movement within the forest.  These could include snorting noises produced by frightened deer fleeing the scene, or even moaning cries coming from injured ones who've lost consciousness.      After locating a potential target, approach slowly until you get close enough to shoot safely without endangering yourself.  Shoot only once you've got a clear line-of-sight between the rifle scope and the animal.  Aim directly above the animal's heart, which lies just behind the front legs.  Remember not to aim too low because doing so increases the risk of hitting vital organs below the diaphragm, causing unnecessary suffering to the animal.        It's important to remember that the best place to harvest a buck is right over his heart.  However,..."}

This guide is intended to help new users become comfortable using this type of machine safely and effectively.    ...Read more...\nThe first step towards becoming an expert user of any tool is understanding how it works.  Zero-turn-mowers work similarly to riding tractors but instead use two large front-wheel-drive motors powered by gasoline engines rather than diesel fuel.  The main difference between a tractor and a ZTR mower lies within the steering mechanism;  A tractor uses a mechanical linkage system called a three-point hitch which allows the driver to steer the vehicle by shifting his weight around the seat.  In contrast, most modern ZTRs utilize electric power steering systems where the driver operates both levers simultaneously to change direction.  Some newer models even feature automatic steering capabilities allowing the driver to simply focus on controlling speed and height settings during normal operations.\n    Before purchasing a ZTR mower it's important to consider several factors including size,..."}

Start by cutting up old shirts until you've got enough material to cover yourself comfortably while wearing what you're planning to design.      Once you've gathered several different cuts of clothes, try them on!     Take note of which parts don't work properly - too short? Too long?  Not wide enough?  Then take those notes back home and start working!  You'll probably find that some areas won't quite match exactly between the various items of clothing; that's okay!   Don't worry about trying things on; it's not necessary unless you feel uncomfortable doing so.       When designing your own pattern, remember that there isn't necessarily only \"one right answer\".        For example, let's say we're going to make our own version of a t-shirt.  We might decide we would prefer longer arms than what's offered in the original pattern.  That's fine!"}

Diaper companies often use pictures of babies and toddlers in order to sell their products; however,  there should also be images depicting older children (teenage boys), adolescents\/young men\/women, and even middle aged women\/men wearing diapers so that consumers will know what type of diapers exist out there.  This way, those who need diapers won't feel ashamed because they'll see others like themselves wearing diapers too.\n\nAnother important aspect of changing people's attitudes toward diapers involves having television shows host discussions related to bedwetting issues; asking famous personalities to share stories about their own struggles with bedwetting while growing up; and encouraging doctors--especially specialists such as urologiststo educate their patients about various options available to treat bedwetting including diapers.  If people knew that there was another option besides simply waking up throughout the night to go to the bathroom,they'd probably be less judgmental. \n\nOne final suggestion I offer here is that authors writing parenting books do not portray diapers negatively by describing them as \"dirty\" or \"unhygienic\".

In physics, thermodynamics deals with how matter changes states (e.g. solid state to liquid state) or transforms itself by absorbing heat and\/or releasing it.   It also studies how systems exchange thermal energy among themselves.    For example, if you have two different substances A and B at room temperature T0 then they will be able to mix together because their molecular energies match up well enough such that there won't be any chemical reactions taking place between them.

Check all four tires for balance first then loosen the lugs again and lift the rear end of the truck higher than normal height.  This helps prevent the front tires from rolling forward during the balancing process.  You may need to repeat these steps several times depending upon what type of vehicle you are balancing.  Make sure there isn't anything obstructing the rotation of each tire once balanced.  Tire pressure must also match manufacturer recommendations.  Never exceed the maximum load capacity listed on the sidewall of every tire.  Do NOT attempt to change the oil yourself unless you know exactly what you're doing!  Visit a mechanic who has experience changing transmission fluid regularly.  Changing the filter alone does not necessarily mean you changed the oil since some filters only require draining without removing the entire reservoir tank.  It takes about 10 minutes per liter of oil to replace the fluid completely.  Be aware that many vehicles now come equipped with synthetic oils rather than mineral based fluids used previously.  Synthetic oils don't break down nearly as quickly but cost more money initially.

Don't forget to take off your watches & jewelry prior to entering the cockpit; these items could get stuck between your body and the seatbelt while the plane crashes into the earth.     Check your seatbelt again after taking off.  It's important to keep your seatbelt fastened throughout the entire crash landing procedure because there may still be some forward motion when the plane touches down.  You want to minimize the amount of force transferred through your body onto the seatbelt.  Your seatbelt should fit snugly against your hip bones instead of your stomach.  Seatbelts don't work properly unless they're buckled correctly.  Never use a seatbelt that's damaged or ripped apart.  Keep your hands clear of the controls.

This helps soften up the outer shell slightly making it easier to remove later.     To do this:  Mix together 2 tablespoons (30 ml) baking soda per 4 cups (1 L)  of distilled white vinegar in a large bowl.  Dip one end of a clean kitchen knife blade into the mixture and swirl it back-and-forth across the entire length of the blade repeatedly.  Then wipe away any excess liquid residue by wiping down both sides of the blade against a clean cloth.  Repeat 2-3 times total.  Let the knife air-dry completely before proceeding.      Peeling the skin off too soon might cause damage to the inner flesh of the nut, resulting in poor germination rates.  Do not store the nuts longer than 1-2 weeks since prolonged storage causes rapid deterioration of quality."}

If you are installing a vinyl fence instead of aluminum, see How To Install Vinyl Fencing For more information.    Step 1:  Prepare the ground where you'll install the posts.  Dig holes that are twice as deep as the height of the posts you're using.  Add concrete mix according to manufacturer's instructions until it reaches halfway up the hole.  Then add water slowly while mixing thoroughly.  Once mixed properly pour the concrete around the base of the post.  Leave about 3 inches between the top edge of the concrete and bottom of the post.     Step 2:  Set the posts in their respective holes.  Make sure they sit level before continuing.      Step 3:  Cover the tops of the posts with caps.  These caps should fit snugly over...   Step 4:  Measure out how long you'd like your fence line to be.  Divide the total distance by 6 feet then round down to get the number of panels required.  Round up if necessary to account for extra material such as gates and corner pieces.  Note that there must always be one line post per panel plus two end posts per panel.  Also note that the spacing between posts depends upon what type of fencing system you've chosen.  See below for details.        Step 5:  Cut the rails along the lines marked off earlier.  Be careful not to cut too close to any corners since you may damage them when assembling the fence later.  Each rail needs to measure exactly six feet long...."}

There are many ways to relieve the discomfort caused by mosquito bites so you don't scratch them until you're bleeding.  This will help keep any infections at bay.  Here are some tips...   How do I stop myself from scratching my mosquito bite?    You should try not to scratch because this could cause more irritation and lead to bacterial growth which might result into an infection.  If you can't resist yourself then use something sharp like tweezers instead of fingers to remove the itchiness.  Make sure it's clean before using it again!     What else can I apply besides cold compress?  Aloe vera gel works great too!  It has anti-inflammatory properties and helps heal wounds faster than other moisturizers.

Wash them thoroughly after each time you wear them since sweat tends to build up inside the metal clips which could cause bacteria growth leading to bad odors and\/or rashes.  Make sure all parts fit together properly - check both ends where the clip attaches to ensure it's snug enough not to come loose while being used.

Plastic buckles usually cost less than brass buckles although they do scratch easier.  Brass buckles generally last longer though they might rust slightly faster due to perspiration.

{"text":"The first step in finding an ordinary (total or complete) differential is to find its corresponding partial derivatives.  The process involves taking one variable at time from functions that contain multiple variables.   In this section we will review how to take partial derivatives using several examples.    We begin by reviewing some basic concepts related to differentiation before moving on to more advanced topics such as the chain rule and Leibniz's theorem.  \nDifferential Calculus - Part 1\n\nCondition for Differentiability\nA function can only have an ordinary differential if it's continuously differentiable over all values within its domain.  A continuous function has no jumps between points; instead there are smooth transitions between them.  This means that any point along the curve connecting two points must also lie somewhere inside the region bounded by those... Continue reading \u2192 \nPartial Derivative Definition\nIn mathematics, a partial derivative measures the rate of change of a multivariate function when you hold certain variables fixed.  For example, let's say you're trying to calculate the total amount of money earned per hour worked by employees who work both part-time and full-time hours.  You might want to know what happens to your earnings after increasing their working hours without changing anything else about their job description.  To do so you'd need to use the partial derivative because the number of hours they work each week varies widely among workers.  If you were calculating the average income per employee then you'd just divide the sum of wages by the number of people employed regardless of whether they're paid $25\/hour every day or $50\/week once a month.  However, since we're interested in knowing exactly how much extra revenue our company earns due to increased productivity we'd need to keep track of individual worker pay rates separately...."}

Be prepared to spend longer than usual getting your tent erected during cold weather conditions.        After you've finished erecting your tent, securely stake it in place.  Stake the corners firmly enough to keep the rain off without damaging anything beneath the canvas.  Keep in mind that there should still be plenty of space around each stake to allow water drainage through them.  There shouldn't be any gaps along the sides of the tent which could cause water to pool against the fabric.      Check the floor of the tent regularly after every rainfall to ensure no damage was caused due to improper staking.       Do NOT tie knots too tightly because doing so might rip the material causing leaks later on; instead, leave loose ends dangling freely until they're tied properly once again.    It's also recommended that you remove the stakes completely prior to packing up your tent...."}

This method will give you a simple yet beautifully designed quilt that's perfect if you've never made one before.  You can use any color combination you'd like; however, it's best not to choose colors that are very bright because they may fade when washed.   If possible, try choosing fabrics that have some texture (such as cotton) rather than smooth ones such as polyester. The more textured the material used, the softer the final product will feel. For example, you could create a checkerboard design by alternating squares of two different colors. Or maybe even add stripes? There really isn't much limitation; you'll only need to decide what kind of look... How many blocks should I cut out?  Start off by planning how many blocks you would like to include in your quilt. Then divide each block's square footage by 12\" x 18\"; this number represents how many strips of fabric you will need per block. (For example: A 10\"x10\" block divided by 12\" x 18\" = 8.)

To do this:    1.) Start by measuring the distance between two points above... 2.) Add up these measurements together to determine the total vertical distance you'd like to cover with your stairs.        3.) Subtract 12 inches (30 cm), then divide by 8 feet (2.4 m).

It would also help if you:     - Have some basic knowledge of mechanics and vehicles.     - Know where most of the parts of your vehicle are.     - Understand how engines work.     - Are familiar with the layout of your vehicle.     - Can lift heavy objects up to 50 kg (110 lb) easily.     - Don't have claustrophobia.     - Be able to reach above shoulder height.     - Be physically fit.     - Wear appropriate clothing such as gloves, safety goggles etc..."}
{"text":"The first step is to create a will.  A will allows you to specify exactly what happens to all of your property after you're gone.   You can also use other documents such as living trusts (trusts that exist while you live); however these aren't always necessary if you've created a valid will.    If you die without having made any provisions regarding your property, then the law determines where your property goes.   This may be very different from what you'd want done with your property when you were alive.  The following steps outline some basic things you'll need to do before writing out your own will.\n\nDecide on Executors\n\nAn executor is someone named by you to carry out your instructions once you pass away.  They'll collect information about your financial affairs so they know what's going into your will.  You'll probably name more than one executor because it's unlikely they'll agree upon everything at... Continue reading \u2192\n\n\n\nYou might choose family members like parents or siblings but this isn't necessarily required.  It's important to remember that executors must take care of many details related to administering your estate including paying bills, filing taxes,  selling real estate  etc..    In addition, there could potentially be legal fees associated with being appointed as an executor.  \n\nGuardianship \n\nA guardian takes over parental responsibilities for minor children.  Guardianship includes making decisions concerning health care, education, religion, welfare benefits, social services, medical treatment, mental health issues, physical safety, sexual abuse prevention, adoption, foster placement, and child custody disputes. \n\nYou'll usually appoint both biological parents' spouses and\/or relatives close to the deceased parent(s).  However, you can also designate friends or trusted professionals instead.  It doesn't matter too much whom you pick since most states require court approval anyway.  Your choice depends largely on who's available during difficult times.     For example, if there's no surviving relative willing to become guardian, then the courts would likely select another adult based solely on his\/her ability to provide adequate care for the child.  There are several factors judges consider when determining who gets custody of minors.  These include the child's best interests; the potential guardian's relationship to the child; the potential guardian's character,..."}

Make sure whatever tool you choose has enough depth capability to reach below the frost line during winter months.    Stake Tags - These plastic tags come pre-punched with holes designed specifically for marking the location of fence posts along their intended route.  They allow you to mark the exact spot without damaging the grass underneath.  There are two types of tags:  Plastic Stake Tag - These are made of thin plastic and are usually sold individually.  Metal Stake Tag - These metal tags feature a larger diameter and are often packaged in sets of 10-20 per package.    Wooden Pins - These pins are similar to the plastic ones except thicker and heavier duty.  They're great for holding up temporary signs until permanent markers become visible after digging the holes.   ..."}

In fact, some scholars believe that more than half of all Old Testament scripture refers directly or indirectly to him.

There were two major groups of people waiting for the Messiah during biblical times:  1)  The Jews;   2)  The Gentiles\/non-Jews.   Both believed he would be born of a virgin mother, come riding upon a donkey, perform miracles such as healing the sick,...and raise himself up from the dead after three days...but each group understood those things differently....so let's begin!

Now here's where confusion begins because most religions teach that everyone has free choice but Christianity teaches otherwise.   You see, when Adam & Eve ate the forbidden fruit, they lost their innocence which meant they could no longer choose freely between good and evil without being tempted by Satan.   They became slaves to sin until the birth of Jesus Christ whose blood cleansed them once again making them pure and righteous children of God.  He said \"I am the way, the truth, and life. ..."}

{"text":"Outsourcing information technology help can save money in many ways.  It also allows businesses to focus more attention on what really matters \u2013 running its core competencies.   The following steps will show you exactly where to begin.    1) Determine if there\u2019s an actual need for outsourcing:  Before deciding whether to hire outside consultants, consider carefully why you\u2019re considering this option at all.  Is there something specific that\u2019s causing problems?  Are you trying to avoid hiring new full-time workers?   If so, then it\u2019s probably best just to look into short-term solutions like contractors instead.  You shouldn\u2019t use external resources as a substitute for having enough qualified personnel within... 2) Decide which tasks would benefit from outsourcing:  Once you've determined there's some problem area(s), it's important to decide precisely what needs fixing before moving forward.  For example, maybe you're struggling because your company's website isn't working properly anymore; perhaps you'd rather spend less time maintaining software applications than developing them; or maybe you simply don't know who has access to certain files any longer (and therefore can't trust anyone).  In each case,... 3) Set clear goals:  After determining what's wrong and identifying areas that might improve upon, set concrete objectives for getting those improvements made.  What specifically does your organization hope to accomplish through outsourcing?  How much improvement do you expect over existing processes?  Do you think you'll see results quickly?... 4) Create a budget:  It's always good practice to create budgets for projects such as these - especially since they're likely to involve significant amounts of money.... 5) Identify potential partners:  Now that you\u2019ve got everything laid out clearly, it\u2019s time to find suitable candidates to fill the role.  Start searching online using keywords related to your industry and\/or location.  Look up local firms specializing in similar services.  Contact several different ones and ask questions like: \u201cWhat kind of clients do you typically serve?\u201d,  \u201cDo you provide training programs for your employees?\u201d,   \"Does your firm offer 24\/7 support?\""}

The information below should be used only as guidelines; there may always be exceptions depending upon weather conditions, driver habits etc.    1.) Drive at slower speeds whenever possible.  This includes both city streets...and highways....  When you're cruising along at 70 mph (112 km\/h), you're burning more gasoline per hour than you'd burn going 50 mph (80 km\/h).  If it's not necessary to go faster,...you'll save yourself money over time!   2.)  Choose the least windy routes you can find..  Wind resistance increases drag force against moving vehicles..which means higher consumption of energy and therefore lower efficiency.  In addition, wind gusts cause sudden changes in velocity - again increasing the amount of energy needed to maintain constant motion.  So try to stay away from areas known for high winds like mountain passes!  You might also want to consider avoiding freeway exits\/entrances because they often create turbulence due to abrupt lane shifts.  Also look out for hills wherever you go...  Hills require extra power to climb them so they're another source of increased friction loss.  And don't forget bridges!...they're notorious for creating significant amounts of aerodynamic drag.

The basic idea behind both methods is similar; however, there are some slight differences between how each works.

You may want to trim away any discoloration from around the base of the stem area where it's connected to the plant's main body.     Rinse thoroughly under cool running water to remove dirt and\/or debris from the outside surface of the artichokes.        Do not cut off all of these leaves -- just about halfway down towards the bottom of the flower bud end of the artichoke.     For example, if you've got 12 large leaves surrounding the center point of the artichoke, then you'll only want 6 left attached when finished cutting.       Once again, do this gently because removing too many leaves could cause damage to the delicate interior structure of the artichoke.    Make sure none of the leaves remain folded back onto themselves once they're removed since doing so would prevent proper drainage during the steaming process.    In addition, make sure no part of the artichoke has been damaged due to rough handling prior to placing it into the steaming pot\/pan.    Some chefs recommend trimming the tops off of the artichokes right above the flower buds; others say leaving them intact makes little difference whatsoever.

They also begin learning racial stereotypes very young; these may be positive (e.g., \"blacks love soul food\") or negative (e.g., \"all blacks look alike\").  In addition, they often experience racism firsthand when interacting with peers who hold racist beliefs.  As such, it is especially important to teach preschoolers and elementary-aged kids about black history so that they grow up knowing what slavery was like and why it's wrong.  Here are some ways teachers can help younger children:  Play games related to black history topics.  For example, ask kids to find out which famous person came before another one using clues based on facts learned during the day's lesson.  Have older kids act out scenes depicting key events in black history while younger ones guess what's happening.  Make sure everyone gets involved!  If you're playing a game where someone has to answer questions correctly, make sure each child gets his\/her turn instead of just letting certain kids dominate the conversation.

This can save significant time when installing multiple devices such as switches, outlets,... The following steps are intended only... For this project we assume there already exists some type of electrical outlet within reach of the point being wired.   In order to run wires along walls, one must first locate the studs behind those walls.... Locating Studs:  Using a stud finder, determine if any studs exist immediately adjacent to the wall surface you're planning to install wiring behind.    A stud finder looks like a small flashlight attached to what resembles a long screwdriver tip.     You should also check all areas near the planned route of the wire to ensure no hidden obstructions exist before proceeding further.    There are several types of stud finders available online ranging anywhere from $20-$100 USD depending upon brand name and features offered.    Some models even come equipped with Bluetooth technology allowing them to communicate wirelessly with mobile phones via apps so they can be used remotely.    Other options include purchasing a stud sensor which attaches magnetically onto screws driven into drywall panels during installation; however these tend to be less accurate than their electronic counterparts.    After determining whether or not there's a stud present next to the wall you'll need to decide how far back you'd like to place the junction box containing the power source for the circuit you've just created.    Depending on the size of the fixture\/device requiring electricity, it's recommended placing the junction box about 12-18 inches away from the nearest wall corner.    It's always best practice to keep the junction box closest possible to its destination since longer runs increase voltage drop across the line causing reduced current flow resulting in dimmer light output and\/or slower operation of appliances connected to the system.   ..."}

For example, place the mounting bracket near the front seat next to the driver's side window.

{"text":"The f scale consists of:  The f scale starts at middle c.  You should play it from low to high.   Practice playing each note individually before trying them together.    To practice blowing harder or softer,  use different embouchures.     If you're having trouble getting any particular note out,   try using alternate fingerings until you've found what works best for you. For example,    instead of putting your ring finger over the fourth hole when playing d,     put it under the fifth hole so it's closer to where you'd normally place your pointer    finger. Alternate between scales and arpeggios while practicing. Once you've got   the basics down, start adding dynamics by alternating between forte and piano. When you're ready to move onto more advanced material, learn how to do vibrato and glissandos. Vibrato means \"trembling\";     glissando refers to sliding from one pitch to another without stopping.

This program allows users to create vector images as well as raster images such as photographs. \n \n In order to get started we will take some time out to explain exactly what these terms mean so let's begin! \n \n \n \n Vector Images are created when lines are drawn between points instead of pixels being placed side-by-side. These types of images allow designers to scale their work without losing quality because they don't rely upon pixel density but rather line thickness.  \n \n Raster Images are created when dots are arranged into squares called \"pixels\". When viewed closely enough all computer screens display only individual pixels; therefore if you zoomed right in close enough you'd see each dot individually. Because of this fact, any image displayed on screen would appear jagged no matter how high its resolution was set. However, once printed onto paper there wouldn't really be much difference whether it's a low-resolution photo or a high-quality digital print since both would look smooth due to the large number of pixels used per square inch. \n \n Now that we've explained those two different ways of displaying images lets move on..."}

For example, New York City has separate BAC levels based on age ranging from .025% - .035% for drivers ages 18-20, .05%-.07% for those aged 20-30, and .10%-.12% for people 30-40.  Other states use weight-based measures instead such as grams of alcohol per deciliter of blood (g\/dL).  A person weighing 150 pounds should never drink more than three drinks within two hours because this could put them above their state's legal limit.

{"text":"Folding maps is an important skill if you're planning any kind of outdoor adventure.  The following instructions will teach you how to fold and store a topo map (a detailed roadmap) properly.   This method works best when used with large-format paper maps such as USGS 1:24000 scale maps; however, smaller-scale maps can be folded similarly but may require more folds than are described here.    If you'd like additional tips about caring for your map once you've finished folding it, see How To Store A Paper Map. Choose a clear, zip-closed plastic bag big enough to hold all four sides of the map together without stretching them out too much.  You should also choose a bag that's thick enough not to tear easily while being pulled across rough terrain.     For example, a standard-size 8 1\/2\" x 11\" sheet of printer paper would fit into a small sandwich baggie made of heavy-duty plastic. Place the map face-down onto a clean work surface.

This means that every time someone takes a turn he\/she must move clockwise from wherever he was sitting until reaching another seat occupied by another player whose turn comes up next.   For example, let's assume that Bob sits directly across from Alice while Charlie sits diagonally opposite her\/him.  After Bob's turn ends he'll need to move over to the chair that's currently being held by Carol who's seated right behind him\/it.  Then once Carol finishes her turn she'll move onto the chair that Bob previously sat down in and continue moving counterclockwise through the circle of chairs until she's back where she started again.

But what exactly does this mean?  What happens when we eat too few carbs?\n\nCarbs: Good or Bad?\nIn order to understand why low-carbing works, let's first look at how eating carbs affects us physically.\n\nWhen we eat food high in starch such as breads, pastas, rice, potatoes, cereals, fruits and vegetables containing starches, these foods break down inside our stomachs into simple sugars called glucose.      Glucose travels through blood vessels all around our bodies where it fuels every cell's need for energy.        When there isn't enough glucose available, cells turn to other sources of fuel known as ketones.  Ketones come from fatty acids found in adipocytes (fatty tissue) located beneath skin and between organs.       This process is known as lipolysis; breaking down of fat stores into free-floating fatty acid chains and glycerol molecules...."}

According to legend, Gautama Buddha met \u0100gama Metteyyia before becoming fully awakened himself.

{"text":"Cobra yoga poses can be done anywhere at any time.  You don't need special equipment; all you'll need is some open space where you're not likely to get knocked over while practicing this advanced posture.   If you'd like to practice outside of class but aren't quite ready yet, try performing cobra indoors first before moving outdoors (or vice versa). The most common place people perform cobra is during their warm-ups prior to beginning an actual workout routine.    This will help prepare them physically and mentally for what lies ahead.  It also helps improve flexibility throughout... Lie flat on your stomach facing upwards towards the ceiling.... Draw your shoulder blades gently apart,... Bend your neck backward until it's almost touching the floor. ...  Exhale deeply through pursed lips.  Inhale again when you've reached peak height.  Repeat 3-5 times per set.  Don't forget about breathing!   Do 2-3 sets total.  Rest between sets 1-2 minutes.  Practice regularly!  Be patient.  Always listen to your body's signals. .    To do this:  Stand straight with your arms raised above your head.  Turn one foot 45 degrees outward.  Rotate your torso 90 degrees counterclockwise around your hip joint.  Bring your arm opposite your turned leg behind your back.  Extend your free hand upward along side your bent knee.  Continue rotating your torso clockwise 180 degrees.  Return to center.  Repeat 10-12 times per set.  Do 2 sets total.  Rest 1 minute between sets.  Try these exercises once every 3-4 days after warming up.  They'll strengthen your core which makes cobra easier to hold longer without straining too much.  These movements should feel natural and easy--don't force anything.  Focus only on feeling good rather than trying to achieve perfection immediately.  For example,  if you find it difficult to keep your elbows tucked under your ribs, simply bring them closer instead of forcing them further inward.  As long as they're still pointing downwards, they won't interfere with the movement itself.  In fact, they'll actually make it look better because it'll give you something else to focus on besides just holding the pose correctly.  It's okay to cheat here since we're talking about improving our technique anyway.  Just remember to always return to correct positioning whenever possible."}

It also does NOT mean agreeing with everything they say; it's perfectly fine if you're different!   You don't need to change yourself completely into someone else's image.   Instead, try to find ways to work together instead of against each other.

Don\u2019t let your parent(s) control every aspect of your life \u2013 especially if they\u2019ve done so since childhood.  Letting go doesn\u2019t necessarily mean giving up entirely.  Sometimes letting go involves accepting certain aspects of your parent\u2019s behavior even though you might prefer otherwise.  Take time away from home occasionally.  This could involve spending weekends elsewhere, taking trips during school holidays, or moving back home temporarily after college graduation.  Keep in mind that no matter where you move, you'll still be able to visit your parents whenever you'd like.  Spend quality time with your siblings.  They'll probably miss you less than your parents would anyway.  Consider joining a support group online or meeting others who share similar experiences.  Find a therapist or counselor whom both parties trust.  A professional opinion can provide valuable insight into any potential problem areas between you and your parents.  The following steps should be taken before attempting to communicate directly with your parents:"}

In fact, it\u2019s often cheaper than paying someone else to do it!

For example, a dresser that\u2019s only half-full might cost twice as much to ship compared to another identical dresser that's completely full.    To save money when shipping bulky items, consider renting a storage unit until after you've moved.    Then fill it with books, clothing, toys etc. instead of sending those items along with your household goods.    Another option would be to ask friends or relatives living nearby to hold onto certain items while you move.    When choosing a mover, check online reviews thoroughly.    Ask around among people whose recent moves were handled by various local firms.    Check references too.    Never pay anything upfront unless you know exactly whom you\u2019re dealing with.

You should also consider getting professional cleaning done on your feather pillows every three years so that they're kept fresh and hygienic. This will help remove dirt from the feathers while preventing damage caused by rubbing against each other during the wash process.   For example, you could use a soft-bristled toothbrush to scrub away stains around seams. Make sure there is no loose fabric sticking up at... Place 2 pillows inside the washing machine along with 1\u20442\u00a0\u00a0c (120\u00a0ml) (2\u20443\u00a0\u00a0tsp) liquid dish soap. The amount of soap you'll need depends on how dirty your pillows are; start small and add more later if necessary. Avoid using regular dishwashing soap because its high suds may cause the feathers to clump together when wet. A mild detergent like Woolite Laundry Stain Remover works best since it won't strip color off of the pillows' covers. To avoid damaging the feathers, set your washing machine's temperature setting to \"Delicate\" instead of \"Hot\". Then select \"Drain & Spin Cycle Only\" rather than \"Washing\". Doing this helps prevent excess moisture from building up within the pillows after they've been cleaned. It'll only take 10 minutes longer but it'll make all the difference!

{"text":"Locking in or floating your interest rate on a home loan has many advantages.  It allows you to know exactly what your monthly payment will be during the life of your loan.   You also have peace of mind knowing that no matter where interest rates go up from here, you\u2019ll still pay less than someone who did not lock theirs in at this current low level.    However there are some disadvantages too.  If interest rates drop before closing day then you\u2019re stuck paying more money over the course of your loan term because you locked them in higher than they were currently available.  Also by locking in now, you're giving yourself little flexibility should you need to move quickly due to job loss etc...

If you notice any signs that your child may have developed a diaper rash (redness around their genitals), apply diaper cream immediately before putting them back into their diaper.    You should always use diaper cream even though there isn't visible redness because it will still provide protection against moisture and friction which could cause problems later down the road.     The most common ingredients found in diaper creams include zinc oxide, lanolin, dimethicone, petrolatum, mineral oil, aloe vera gel, chamomile extract, vitamin E, calendula flower extract, oatmeal powder, shea butter, glycerin, and other natural moisturizers such as coconut oil and olive oil.    There... are many types of diaper creams available today ranging from basic unscented formulas made primarily out of zinc oxide to more expensive varieties containing additional active ingredients like calamine lotion, witch hazel, tea tree oil, and others.  Some parents prefer using plain old vaseline over diaper creams since it's less messy but this product does little to actually treat existing diaper rashes and won't keep your baby's bottom soft either...."}

It has been praised for its graphics, soundtracks (both original music composed specifically for SSBM), characters' designs, story mode, online play modes, multiplayer options, and more.   The gameplay itself was revolutionary when released on GameCube back in 2002 -  players could now control their character using analog sticks instead of directional buttons only.    This made movement much smoother than ever seen before; however, this new feature came along with some problems too.     In order to make up for these issues, Nintendo added several features such as:    *The ability to hold down special moves like forward smash until they were fully charged.        *A \"special meter\" which would fill overtime while holding certain attacks.        *New ways to recover health after taking damage including items and healing stages.        *More advanced controls allowing for better precision movements.

Exercise doesn't necessarily mean playing sports like basketball or soccer.  It could simply involve walking around the block after school or running errands with friends.  To determine whether your child gets enough exercise ask yourself questions like:  Does my child get plenty of opportunities to run?  Is he able to walk up stairs without stopping? Do his muscles feel tired after exercising? Are his joints sore?\nIf your child isn't physically active then encourage him\/her to do more.  Encourage your child to:  Walk instead of riding bikes whenever possible.  Take public transportation rather than driving cars wherever possible.  Ride rollerblades or skateboards instead of using scooters where applicable.  Go swimming once per week.  Play games involving jumping rope every night before dinner.  Run through sprinklers daily.

Prevent cheating rather than catching cheats\n\nThe best thing about preventing cheating is that it's much easier than trying to catch people cheating after they've done something wrong.

Beginners may want to choose shorter skis which allow them greater control over their movements but also make maneuverability difficult.     An appropriate harness: This must fit snugly without restricting movement too much; however, it needs to stay put during rough conditions such as choppy waves.      Life jackets: These come in various sizes depending upon age\/weight and whether they're intended for children or adults.        Boots: They provide protection against cold water temperatures and sharp objects like rocks and branches.       Ropes: These range widely based on preference and budget. Some prefer short ropes because they offer better control than longer ones do. However, long ropers have less resistance due to friction caused by the rope rubbing along itself. Longer ropes tend to last longer though since there isn't any wear occurring inside the core of the rope."}

{"text":"The most important thing when choosing primary colors for painting or drawing is consistency.  You want to be able to reproduce exactly whatever shade you've decided upon whenever you're ready to use it; otherwise you'll end up wasting time trying to match something that's not quite right.   The best way to ensure this is to choose just 3 colors from among those available at any art supply store - preferably ones whose names don't change depending on where they were purchased. (e.g. Red, Yellow & Blue).  These will become known as your \"Primary Colors\"; if you need more than 3 colors later on, it's always possible to create new shades by combining existing ones.    To begin determining how many primary colors there should really be, we must first understand why artists traditionally chose to limit themselves to just 2 primaries instead of...

The next step toward getting into a PhD program would usually involve taking the Graduate Record Examination General Test (the \"GRE\").  While this exam isn't required for all English majors applying to English PhD programs, it's highly recommended because it measures skills such as:   Analytical Writing \u2014 Your ability to analyze information presented both verbally and visually.

Never give away too much personal information like phone number, home address etc..   Always remember never to share your password with anyone else unless absolutely necessary.  Change Passwords Regularly  Changing your passwords regularly helps keep hackers off your system.  Remember to choose strong passwords which include letters, numbers and symbols so it\u2019s harder to guess them.  Avoid using common phrases used in songs lyrics because this makes it easier for hackers to hack into your systems.  Try to avoid using birthdays, family members\u2019 names, pets' names, favourite sports teams etc..  Using One Credit Card For Online Transactions Only  Having multiple credit cards increases chances of being targeted by hackers since each time you shop online, you need to enter different credit card details.  Therefore it's advisable to limit yourself to just 1 credit card per online purchase made.  However, if you're shopping overseas then you'll probably require another credit card that's linked to a foreign currency.  So before buying anything abroad via the web, ask yourself whether you'd rather pay extra charges or risk losing money due to exchange rates fluctuations.  Don't forget to cancel unused credit cards once you've finished using them...."}

Lay one end of this strip flat against the center back of your child so they are standing up straight.     Place another piece of tape down next to where you've placed the first piece of tape but about 5 inches (13 cm)  above their hip bone.     Continue placing these tapes all around her body from front to back and then repeat the process again going forward instead of backward.   ...    Start making the second layer of ruffles by laying two rows of 2 inch wide strips across the base of the gathered ruffle....     The third row should also start off like the previous ones except now there won't be any gaps left open because you're starting over from scratch rather than continuing onto the last set of strips you had started before.      Once you reach the end of the fourth row continue adding new sets of 2 inch wide strips until you get close enough to the hem line to finish the final row without having to add extra strips.        When you reach the end sew them together leaving a small gap near the hem line which you will turn under afterward.       If you'd prefer less volume simply cut some of the strips shorter while still keeping the same number of strips per row.         ..."}

{"text":"The following instructions describe how to build your own concrete mixer from scratch.  This project requires some basic tools such as a pipe wrench, drill bit(s), hack saw, etc.. It also involves cutting holes into pipes which may require additional safety precautions like wearing goggles when drilling.   If you're not comfortable working around power saws and\/or drills then consider hiring someone who knows what they're doing for help building this machine.    To begin making our DIY concrete mixer we need to create 3 blades inside the rotating drum.  Cutting these out of steel bar stock ensures they won't bend under pressure during use.     Using a hacksaw cut each blade at 45 degree angles along their length starting about 1 inch away from one end.  Each blade needs to have 2 inches...Next we'll add the handlebars onto the front of the mixer.  Drill 4 holes evenly spaced apart across both ends of the top tube.  Thread bolts through them and tighten down until snug but don't overtighten because you'll still want to be able to rotate the bars freely later on.  Once you've finished securing all four bolts remove excess material between the bolt heads and the surface of the metal.  Next slide the handlebar brackets onto the tops of the handlebars and install the nuts and lockwashers necessary to keep everything attached.  These parts were purchased separately online however it's possible to find similar ones locally too...."}
{"text":"The following steps show how to find out exactly when Easter falls in your calendar using only basic math skills.  This method works because all years have an even number of days except leap years.   To determine if it's a leap year just check whether Februray has 29 days instead of 28.    If you're looking forward many years into the future you'll want to make sure... \nThis wikiHow teaches you how to figure out the date of Easter by hand without relying on computer software like Excel or Google Sheets. You may also wish to read How to Find Easter Using Microsoft Excel.     Step 1: Write down the dates of Easter from 1900 through 2050. These are available online at: http:\/\/www.usacatholicschoolbooks.com\/easter\/calendar-of-easter-dates-1900-2050.html     Step 2: Determine the last digit of the year code. Add up the digits of the year until they equal four. Then multiply them times ten. Subtract these figures from the total number of days since Jan 1st, 1900. The remaining number should be divisible by 7. (For example, 2020 would give you:  2020 - 19 x 10 - 9 = 21 - 190 - 90 = 11 - 210 = -1)  Note that there were no leap years between 1901 and 1930; therefore, their codes remain unchanged compared to those used before 1950.        Step 3: Figure out the day code based upon the month and year. Multiply the month's code by its corresponding factor below. Then add the result to the year code:   Months    Factor        Date Codes         1       1           31              2       2           30               3       3           31                4       4           28                 5       5           31                6       6           30               7       7           31            ..."}
{"text":"Coffee enemas have been used since ancient times.  They were popularized during World War II among German soldiers who wanted to stay awake while fighting on the front lines.

The scientific evidence supporting their use remains limited at best; however there may still... Continue reading here.... \nThe following steps will help prepare yourself mentally and physically for administering this procedure safely and effectively.  Be sure to:  Read up on how to perform a safe and effective coffee enema online and\/or in books available at most bookstores.  Talk over any questions you might have regarding safety concerns related to performing a coffee enema with someone knowledgeable such as a doctor, nurse, pharmacist,...   Prepare all supplies needed prior to beginning including but not limited to:  A large bowl filled with warm tap water.  An electric kettle capable of boiling water quickly without scorching.  A clean plastic bucket or other storage device big enough to hold the entire batch of coffee once strained.  Cheese-cloth, cotton cloth, or cotton muslin lined strainers.  Large measuring spoons.  Clean glass jars or bottles.  Syringes.  Plastic bags designed specifically for storing liquids like milk or juice.  Disposable rubber gloves.  Rubber bands.  Cotton swabs dipped in rubbing alcohol.  Soap and hot water.  Hydrogen Peroxide and Water Solution.  Coconut Oil, K-Y Jelly, or other lubricants.  Small cups or glasses.  Hot pads.  Ice packs.  Thermometers.  Food coloring if desired.  Make sure you're using freshly roasted organic beans ground just prior to making the coffee.  If possible grind them right before preparing each dose.  This ensures maximum effectiveness because older grounds lose some of their beneficial properties due to oxidation.  You should also make sure that:  Your coffee has never come in contact with chlorine bleach which destroys many important nutrients found naturally occurring in coffee beans.  It does NOT need to be decaffeinated unless you want to avoid caffeine altogether.  It's always better to start small - especially if you've never had a coffee enema before.  Start out with only 1\/2 cup (118ml)..."}
{"text":"Coiling is an efficient way for climbers to store their ropes.  It also makes it easier to carry them around while traveling.   This method will allow you to pack several hundred feet (100\u00a0m) into one small package that can be carried on your back like a backpack.    The most common type of coiled rope used by climbers today has been developed over many years at the Yosemite Valley School of Rock Climbing under the direction of its founder Dean Kamen.  In this style of packing, all but about 1 foot (.3 m) of rope are wrapped tightly around itself forming tight loops which then become attached to form larger bundles called \"ropesets\".  These sets may contain anywhere between 10 and 100 individual loops depending upon how much rope was originally wound.     To begin winding your rope using this technique you'll need to:  A large coil of rope requires two people working closely together so consider finding someone else who knows what they are doing before attempting any part of...   - Buying a rope bag or stuff sacks"}
